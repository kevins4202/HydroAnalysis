18605,sludge of which alginate like biomaterial is a major organic component is an increasing environmental problem thus efficient anaerobic degradation of alginate provides a new method for sludge utilization in this study anaerobic alginate hydrolytic bacteria ahb were proposed to enrich with methanogens synergetically to reduce the inhibition of intermediate metabolites the cod of produced methane reached 80 7 1 9 n 4 of initial alginate cod after considering the microbial growth 8 18 of cod a good cod balance indicated that alginate was fully consumed and the main final metabolites were methane and co2 methanogenesis could promote alginate conversion by ahb the enriched bacteria for alginate degradation in this study were different from that of former known ahb the metabolic pathway of alginate degradation was revealed by metagenomics in which oligo alginate lyase was detected in twelve bacteria and typical carbon metabolic pathways to convert alginate to methane were identified more studies of bacterial isolation and biofuel production are still needed in the future graphical abstract image 1 keywords alginate hydrolytic bacteria methanogens methane oligo alginate lyase metabolic pathways 1 introduction large amounts of wastewater derived sludge are produced worldwide consequently sludge disposal is an increasing environmental problem and usually accounts for up to 50 of the total operating cost of the wastewater plant bala subramanian et al 2010 zhen et al 2017 anaerobic digestion is an important environmental biotechnology that offers the benefits of converting waste activated sludge was into valuable chemical products such as methane and acetate mckennedy and sherlock 2015 zhang et al 2013 however it is well known that hydrolysis of was is the rate limiting step because of the extracellular polymeric substances eps and hard cell wall zhen et al 2017 various pretreatment technologies including mechanic thermal chemicals advanced oxidation processes and microbial methods have been developed to accelerate the hydrolysis and improve the efficiency of anaerobic digestion chen et al 2019 the microbial method is characterized as relatively low energy input and capital cost and high temperature can also promote the hydrolysis process for example ge et al 2011 reported that the hydrolysis coefficients of was under thermophilic pre treatment of 60 c 0 5 d 1 and 70 c 0 8 d 1 were higher than that of mesophilic pre treatment 0 2 d 1 selectivity of the microbial method however was poor extracellular proteins and polysaccharides are the main components of eps thus xin et al 2016 used the hydrolytic enzymes blend of lysozyme a amylase protease and cellulase to enhance was converting in which soluble chemical oxygen demand cod protein and carbohydrate increase up to about 6000 9000 mg l 1500 3000 mg l and 550 700 mg l respectively however the enzyme method is challenged by the high running cost lin et al reported that an alginate like biomaterial is more than 10 w w of the organic matter in aerobic granular sludge lin et al 2015 alginate is a linear polysaccharide composed of two monomeric units of α l guluronate g and β d mannuronate m thus the conversion of alginate may also promote the hydrolysis of polysaccharides and eps however alginate hydrolytic bacteria ahb are seldom enriched in anaerobic reactors and most studies focus on pure culture wargacki et al 2012 van hal et al 2014 for example sphingomonas sp strain a1 is a soil isolated bacterium that can directly transport alginate into its cytoplasm murata et al 2008 but the degradation percentage kinetics and the yields of metabolites were not described recently a thermophilic bacterium algibacter alginolytica hz22t was enriched from coastal sediment the main metabolites of alginate 20 g l were ethanol 3 5 g l and acetate 3 2 g l after 120 h fermentation but alginate was not fully consumed with a residual alginate amount of 4 5 g l ji et al 2016 compared to pure culture fermentation mixed culture fermentation mcf has the advantage of no sterilization requirement options for continuous fermentation and being adaptive to variations in feedstock or process conditions batstone and virdis 2014 dai et al 2017 moen et al 1997 demonstrated the degradation of alginate and mannitol in mcf the main metabolites were acetate ethanol and butyrate but the enriched bacteria were unclear recently a mesophilic batch reactor was operated to degrade alginate by mcf and the maximum yield of volatile fatty acids vfa including acetate propionate and butyrate reached only 37 1 pham et al 2013 bacteroides and clostridium related microorganisms were identified as the enriched bacteria seon et al 2014 accumulated metabolites such as hydrogen and acetate can inhibit bacterial activity and result in substrate accumulation zhang et al 2012 regueira et al 2018 for example zhang et al 2012 reported that the glucose degrading rate decreased from 27 3 to 19 8 gcod gcod d when hydrogen accumulated in the anaerobic reactor algibacter alginolytica hz22t could not totally consume alginate the remaining percentage was about 23 ji et al 2016 thus removing the accumulated metabolites might reduce the inhibition and promote the alginate conversion methanogens can degrade the fermentation intermediates and improve the bacterial activity for example nobu et al 2015 reported that methanogens could metabolize catabolic by products and detritus of terephthalate ta which consequently facilitated the holistic ta mineralization to co2 and ch4 but currently such reports to improve the activity of ahb are still unknown in mcf disclosing the dominant bacteria by molecular methods is essential for explanation of the reactor performance vanwonterghem et al 2014 combining illumina high throughput sequencing and 16s rrna clone library sequencing could reveal the diversity of enriched microorganisms in mcf vanwonterghem et al 2015 schloss et al 2016 metagenomics is also an important tool to reveal the metabolic pathways in such cultures kouzuma et al 2018 as a result the aim in this study was 1 to enrich the alginate hydrolytic bacteria with methanogens in mcf 2 to reveal the key microbial community members by combining 16s rrna clone library sequencing and illumina miseq high throughput sequencing 3 to demonstrate the anaerobic degradation pathway of alginate by mcf the outcomes will be beneficial for the future production of biochemicals from sludge by mcf 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculum and enriching of alginate hydrolytic bacteria the anaerobic sludge used in this study was collected from a lab scale mesophilic 35 c anaerobic reactor feeding with both ethanol and acetate this inoculum was sparged with n2 of 99 99 for 20 min and then 5 ml was transferred into a serum bottle with a total volume of 120 ml the serum bottle was filled with 40 ml of synthetic inorganic medium in 50 mm phosphate buffer solution ph 7 3 zhang et al 2012 and the medium ingredients in 1 0 l distilled water were as follows nh4cl 500 mg kh2po4 200 mg na2so4 40 mg kcl 50 mg cacl2 10 mg mgcl2 6h2o 70 mg

of serum battle and the headspace were 45 and 75 ml respectively the bottle was sealed with a butyl rubber stopper and an aluminum cap alginate was purchase from aladdin shanghai aladdin bio chem technology co ltd and used as the only organic substrate the 0 1 g of alginate was added at day 0 and then 0 3 g were added at the end of each cycle the temperature was controlled at 35 c with a constant temperature incubator at day 160 the enriched bacteria were transferred to another reactor with working volume of 1 5 l and headspace of 0 5 l the new reactor was provided with fresh medium and 8 0 g l of alginate were added every 10 days till day 360 50 of the total medium was replaced with fresh medium every 30 days to demonstrate the effect of methanogens on alginate converting process after day 360 three alginate concentrations of 1 0 2 5 and 8 0 g l were designed and every experiment was carried out in duplicate group 1 b1 and b2 group 2 b3 and b4 40 ml of broth in the 1 5 l reactor was extracted and added in four serum bottles 40 ml of working volume and 80 ml of headspace 10 mm 2 bromoethane sulfonate bes the methanogenic specific inhibitor was added in group 2 to inhibit the methanogens the serum bottles were purged with n2 for 20 min and sealed with a butyl rubber stopper the serum bottles were cultured in a shaker at 150 rpm and 35 c the gaseous and liquid samples were finally analyzed after 12 days 2 2 metabolite analysis gas samples were taken by a gas tight glass syringe sge australia the hydrogen and methane contents were determined with a gas chromatograph lunan model sp7890 cn equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a 2 m stainless steel column tdx 01 zhang et al 2012 the temperatures of the injector detector and column were kept at 80 100 and 50 c respectively ar was used as the carrier gas the concentrations of ethanol and vfas such as acetate and butyrate were measured by a gas chromatograph agilent 7890 ca with a flame ionization detector and a 10 m 0 53 mm hp ffap fused silica capillary column zhang et al 2012 the samples were pre filtered with 0 45 mm microfilter membrane and then were acidified with 3 v v formic acid before analysis alginate concentration was measured according to jiao et al 2014 at uv254nm by an high performance liquid chromatography system waters 1525 waters usa coupled with a size exclusion chromatography column shodex protein kw 802 5 shoko japan polystyrene sulfonate standards were used to calibrate the retention time for the apparent molecular weight the cod balance calculation was based on the cod of initial alginate and final metabolites the final metabolic yields were calculated in reference to the initial alginate 2 3 characterization of microbial communities 2 3 1 dna extraction the five microbial samples were each collected from initial inoculum and suspending biomass on days 100 160 270 and 360 and were named ahb 0 ahb 100 ahb 160 ahb 270 and ahb 360 respectively each sample was washed with the pbs solution and then dna were extracted according to our former report zhang et al 2016 2 3 2 illumina miseq high throughput sequencing and data analysis the pcr primer of modified 341f modified 806r zhang et al 2016 was used to analyze dna samples of ahb 0 ahb 100 ahb 160 ahb 270 and ahb 360 the amplification was carried out by abi geneamp 9700 majorbio corporation shanghai china sequencing was then performed by an illumina miseq pe 300 high throughput sequencer majorbio corporation shanghai china operational taxonomical units otus were picked to analyze phylogenetically bacterial diversities according to the sequence identity of 97 the sequencing data of the five samples ahb 0 ahb 100 ahb 160 ahb 270 and ahb 360 were deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive under the accession numbers srr5439691 srr5447416 srr5447415 srr5439687 and srr5439688 respectively 2 3 3 16s rrna clone library sequencing and phylogenetic analysis for 16s rrna clone library sequencing the universal primers of bacteria 27f and 1492r and archaea arch20f and arch 958r were used to amplify the dna sample of ahb 360 kröber et al 2009 the amplification was carried out by abi geneamp 9700 majorbio corporation shanghai china then the positive clones were selected and sequenced by the abi prismtm 3730xl dna analyzer majorbio corporation shanghai china the obtained 16s rrna gene sequences were compared with sequences in the genbank database a neighbor joining tree was made with the mega 4 1 beta software in which bootstrap analysis with 5000 replicates was performed to estimate the confidence of the tree topologies 2 3 4 metagenomic analyzing the genomic dna of ahb 360 was analyzed by an illumina hiseq 2000 platform according to the 101 bp paired end strategy majorbio corporation shanghai china sequence reads of low quality or ambiguous were removed and the pair end sequence reads were then merged into tags the average length of tags was about 170 bp the sequencing data were finally deposited in the ncbi under the accession number of samn10583699 3 results and discussion 3 1 alginate degradation in mesophilic mcf the alginate hydrolytic bacteria were enriched within 105 days in a mesophilic repeated batch reactor alginate 0 1 g was added at day 0 and then alginate 0 3 g was added each time when methane partial pressure in the headspace did not notably increase the production of gaseous metabolites including methane hydrogen and co2 from alginate is shown in fig 1 a during the entire experiment hydrogen was not detected nor ph value did the change notably within 7 2 7 3 in the first and second cycles in fig 1a methane contents increased slowly the final methane partial pressures were 0 11 atm day 15 and 0 77 atm day 49 respectively the methane yield increased notably in the following four cycles and the final methane partial pressures were 0 93 atm day 64 6 0 92 atm day 82 0 95 atm day 93 6 and 0 90 atm day 105 respectively in the last four cycles the cod of produced methane was 82 7 2 3 n 4 of the initial alginate cod alginate was converted to biomass in anabolism cod percentage of biomass to substrate in mcf was reported around 8 and even amounted to 18 zhang et al 2014 temudo et al 2007 dai et al 2018 thus a good cod balance 90 was achieved in this study after the initial enrichment fig 1a methane hydrogen co2 and liquid metabolites such as acetate butyrate and ethanol were determined in four subsequent alginate degradation cycles fig 1b acetate was the sole intermediate metabolite in liquid solution other compounds such as ethanol propionate and butyrate were below 0 1 mg l detection limit was 0 1 mg l hydrogen in the headspace was also below 0 01 atm detection limit was 0 01 atm the profiles of methane and acetate production from alginate are shown in fig 1b the final methane partial pressures were 0 91 0 02 atm n 4 acetate accumulated after alginate addition but rapidly declined again within 3 days the peak of accumulated acetate would represent 30 of the added alginate cod the acetate concentration was below detection limit 0 1 mg l during most of the cycle these results demonstrated that the majority of alginate 7 5 g l was degraded with 3 days the cod recovered as methane was 80 7 1 9 n 4 of initial alginate cod after considering the incorporation in biomass cod 8 18 dai et al 2018 a good cod balance of 90 was achieved which indicated that main metabolite of alginate was only methane to demonstrate the alginate consumption alginate ca was also used as the substrate but the enriched bacteria could not consume it and no methane was detected in the headspace supplementary fig s1 after the phosphate was added to remove ca2 from alginate ca alginate was totally consumed again and cod balance reached 82 1 uv254nm was an important factor to determine the alginate concentration supplementary fig s2 kim and dempsey 2013 according to the absorbance profiles at uv254nm the molecular weight spectrum of alginate fig 2 a revealed that the absorbance at 60 000 da was a typical value to analyze alginate degradation fig 2b shows the molecular weight change of alginate in a typical degrading cycle the absorbance of 60 000 da decreased notably and alginate gradually changed to lower molecular weights of 2 668 1 740 and 600 at day 12 the absorbances of those sites were all close to 0 which meant that alginate was totally consumed by mcf to demonstrate the inhibition of intermediates on alginate hydrolytic bacteria bes was added to inhibit methanogens and hydrogen and acetate were identified as the main metabolites and no methane was detected table 1 shows the results of final cod balance in control experiments under the initial alginate concentrations of 1 0 2 5 and 8 0 g l methane was the main metabolite the cod balance was 80 0 1 4 85 1 3 4 and 85 5 7 2 respectively in the experiments with additional bes no methane was detected and acetate and hydrogen were accumulated notably but the cod balance was lowered to 63 5 2 1 65 8 2 7 and 65 5 2 1 respectively and part of alginate was not consumed these results indicated that intermediates of acetate and hydrogen inhibited alginate conversion ji et al 2016 reported that alginate degradation experiments for a thermophilic pure culture that took 5 days when the percentage of residual alginate was higher than 20 therefore our synergistic enrichment of alginate degrading bacteria with methanogens demonstrated better conversion than former studies 3 2 illumina high throughput sequencing of alginate degrading consortium the dna samples including ahb 0 ahb 100 ahb 160 ahb 270 and ahb 360 were analyzed to reveal the diversities of microbial communities by the illumina high throughput sequencing their sequencing indices are shown in supplementary table s1 over 30 000 effective sequences were obtained and the maximum value was amount to 42 000 the mean sequences lengths were above 430 bp the otu number of ahb 0 was 143 after 100 days enriching the values increased to 252 ahb 100 and then decreased to 186 ahb 360 furthermore high coverages all above 0 998 were obtained in this study the curves of shannon index supplementary fig s3 also showed the sequencing depth met the standard to analyze the consortium meanwhile supplementary fig s4 shows that rod shape bacteria dominate the alginate degrading bacteria by sem the phylogenetic levels including domain a and genus b of microbial consortia ahb 0 ahb 100 ahb 160 ahb 270 and ahb 360 are summarized in fig 3 the community changed notably after 360 days of operation at the domain level fig 3a the percentage of bacteria increased from 72 7 ahb 0 to 95 6 ahb 360 fig 3b shows the community diversities at the genus level that norank f synergistaceae 14 1 unclassified o desulfuromonadales 14 3 and norank c w27 15 8 were the main bacteria at the genus level of the inoculum ahb 0 the percentages of these three bacteria however decreased to below 1 0 after 360 day cultivation on the other hand several uncultured bacteria including vadinbc27 wastewater sludge group 13 2 clostridium sensu stricto 1 14 6 lentimicrobium 11 8 and thauera 16 7 were enriched after 360 day cultivation these enriched bacteria were much different from known ahb such as sphingomonas sp strain a1 murata et al 2008 and algibacter alginolytica hz22 t ji et al 2016 the genus vadinbc27 wastewater sludge group belonged to the phylum bacteroidetes that were detected in the anaerobic digesters treating sugars and food wastewater venkiteshwaran et al 2017 lee et al 2017 the genus clostridium sensu stricto 1 was cluster i of the clostridia that can consume many substrates such as glucose mannose and hydrolysis of aesculin lawson and rainey 2016 hahnke et al 2014 lentimicrobium was enriched from anaerobic reactors treating chlorinated solvents polluted wastewater and high strength starch based organic wastewater and the metabolites included acetate hydrogen and butyrate matturro et al 2018 sun et al 2016 thauera generally characterized in the denitrification process to reduce nitrate to gaseous products etchebehere and tiedje 2005 was also enriched in anaerobic digesters to treat waste activated sludge yang et al 2015 baek et al 2016 thus these novel enriched bacteria can be considered as ahb in mcf but further work is still necessary to reveal their functions at the domain level fig 3a the percentage of archaea decreased from 27 3 ahb 0 to 4 4 ahb 360 methanosaeta a typical acetoclastic methanogen chen and he 2015 was the main archaea with an abundance of 24 3 in the sample of ahb 0 after 360 days cultivation this percentage however had decreased to 2 2 at the genus levels other methanogens including methanobacterium hydrogenotrophic methanogen methanoculleus hydrogenotrophic methanogen and methanosarcina both acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogen thauer et al 2008 were also detected in ahb 360 but the percentages were 0 55 0 92 and 0 52 respectively thus these enriched archaea could convert the intermediates of hydrogen and acetate to methane 3 3 16s rrna clone library sequencing of alginate hydrolytic bacteria to reveal the bacterial and archaeal compositions at the species level the 16s rrna clone library sequencing of ahb 360 was analyzed fig 4 fig 4a shows that clostridium quinii strain dsm 6736 26 5 uncultured bacterium clone 72b 26 5 and uncultured bacterium clone ahpd bac2 b09 17 6 were the main detected bacteria in ahb 360 moreover the query cover percentage of lentimicrobium saccharophilum to uncultured bacterium clone ahpd bac2 b09 also amounted to 98 however the percentage of clostridium sensu stricto 1 and lentimicrobium at the genus level was 14 6 and 11 8 by illumina high throughput sequencing respectively and the percentage of thauera phenylacetica was only 2 9 clostridium quinii was isolated from a granular methanogenic sludge reactor uasb from a wastewater treatment plant at a sugar refinery which can convert glucose to metabolites of acetate ethanol and h2 svensson et al 1992 uncultured bacterium clone 72b was obtained from an industrial anaerobic digestor sun et al 2016 recently reported that lentimicrobium saccharophilum was isolated from methanogenic granular sludge and the main metabolites of glucose were acetate propionate formate and hydrogen uncultured bacterium clone ahpd bac2 b09 was also initially identified in lab scale anaerobic bioreactors for auto generative high pressure digestion the percentage of other colons including uncultured bacterium clone vhw d r9 cellulosilyticum lentocellum and mariniphaga anaerophila were all below 10 these enriched bacteria were much different from known ahb of sphingomonas sp strain a1 and algibacter alginolytica hz22 t thus this key bacterium to hydrolyze alginate was still unclear for acetoclastic methanogens the percentage of methanosaeta genus including m harundinacea and m concilii was 27 6 fig 4b for hydrogenotrophic methanogens methanoculleus sediminis was enriched and the percentage was 24 1 methanosarcina mazei which was characterized to be both acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogen was also detected and the percentage was 10 3 these enriched archaea were also identified by illumina high throughput sequencing which could convert the intermediates both hydrogen and acetate of alginate to methane however the function of uncultured crenarchaeote clone ar3102 36 7 was unclear liu et al 2011 reported that it was initially enriched from an anaerobic sludge digester thus this main methanogen also can produce methane from the intermediates of alginate 3 4 metagenomic analysis since the alginate hydrolytic bacteria was not identified by illumina high throughput sequencing and 16s rrna clone library sequencing the sample of ahb 360 was further analyzed by metagenomic analysis by a metagenomics analysis table 2 twelve bacteria species including algibacter lectus bacteroides clarus and bacteroides fragilis could produce oligo alginate lyase to degrade alginate to monomers but were not detected by 16s rrna clone library and high throughput sequencing which meant that the percentage of these bacteria were rather low and further studies are also necessary to enrich these bacteria it shall be noted that algibacter lectus is identified as a novel genus of algibacter that can degrade alginate to acetate and hydrogen nedashkovskaya et al 2004 which is related to the well known alginate hydrolytic bacterium of algibacter alginolytica hz22t the full metabolic pathways of these monomers were detected by metagenomic analysis supplementary fig s5 in which the final metabolites of alginate degradation were methane and co2 this result was consistent with the experimental results from fig 1 3 5 biological process to convert alginate to methane in mcf since the otu number of ahb 360 was about 186 by illumina high throughput sequencing it was hard to summarize the function of all enriched bacteria in ahb 360 thus according to the results of 16s rrna clone library sequencing high throughput sequencing and metagenomic analysis the biological process of converting alginate to methane is proposed in fig 5 alginate was first hydrolyzed to two monomeric units of α l guluronate g and β d mannuronate m by oligo alginate lyase g and m were converted to acetate and hydrogen by genera of vadinbc27 wastewater sludge group clostridium sensu stricto 1 and lentimicrobium in which pyruvate was produced through embden meyerhof parnas emp and entner doudoroff ed pathways the intermediates of acetate and hydrogen were finally converted to methane by acetoclastic methanogens of methanosaeta and methanosarcina and hydrogenotrophic methanogens of methanobacterium methanoculleus and methanosarcina it is also noted that wang et al 2016 reported ed was the main pathway to convert guluronate and mannuronate to pyruvate however in the present study both ed and emp pathways were detected as a result more procedures such as bacteria isolating and metabolic pathways analyzing by single cell genomic and metatranscriptomic analyses are still needed in the future 3 6 perspective of alginate degrading bacteria conversion of organic substrates such as sludge to biofuels and chemicals by mcf is an alternative to traditional petroleum related production eps is important for protection of sludge cells against harmful substances or adverse environments but it also can affect the sludge disintegration rate desmond et al 2018 gagliano et al 2015 thus the hydrolysis is the rate limiting step because of the extracellular polymeric substances eps and hard cell wall zhen et al 2017 recently the biological pretreatment such as a amylase and protease stands out for economic and safety reasons for converting sludge lü et al 2016 teo and wong 2014 for example xin et al 2016 used the hydrolytic enzymes blend lysozyme a amylase protease and cellulase to digest was and the main results showed that soluble cod protein and carbohydrate in solution presented a substantial increase up to about 6000 9000 mg l 1500 3000 mg l and 550 700 mg l lü et al 2016 found that polygalacturonic acid like matter hydrolysis caused significant release of polysaccharides but the temperature and ph adjustment were necessary to maintain the enzyme activity teo and wong 2014 also proposed that low enzymatic activities were probably due to the instability of free enzymes in the bioreactor environment lin et al 2015 reviewed that an alginate like biomaterial was more than 10 w w of the organic matter in aerobic granular sludge in this study we enriched a mixed culture that could convert alginate to methane which provide a new method for sludge utilization to be verified in the future moreover it is known that eps is a complex structure that includes lb eps tb eps and sb eps its degradation also changes sludge properties such as dewatering svennevik et al 2019 the protein and humics in real sludge may also affect the activity of enriched ahb thus future studies for the application of ahb in sludge utilization will be performed the traditional substrates sucrose and glucose raise the food vs fuel debate and the human dependent land use saladini et al 2016 the lignocellulose biomass is currently considered to be an important substrate for biofuels production but lignin is resistant to microbial degradation zhang et al 2013 abubackar et al 2011 aquatic cultured feedstocks are the ideal substrates for the third generation biofuels production saladini et al 2016 marine algae are especially considered to be an untapped source that offer many benefits over the substrates for first and second generation biofuels such as starch glucose or lignocellulose biomass because of abundant carbohydrate contents low lignin contents the absence of conflicts with food production and lower total cost domozych 2006 lehahn et al 2016 lehahn et al 2016 predicted that third generation biofuels derived from macroalgae can provide the total energy of 18 1015 kj year which has the potential to fully displace the use of fossil fuels in the transportation sector alginate is the major matrix component of the brown algal cell wall which may constitute up to 30 60 of the dry weight of the brown algae domozych 2006 thus the efficient degradation of alginate from both sludge and marine algae by mcf might be an essential aspect of the bio based economy in this study alginate could be completely consumed for methane production by mcf which offers an important pathway for utilization of marine algae moreover once methanogenesis is inhibited in mcf the intermediates such as acetate or hydrogen will accumulate which are also important biofuels and chemicals recently production of medium chain fatty acids such as caproate from cellulosic substrate and glycerol raises increased attentions due to their better fuel value and easier separation from the fermentation broth zhang et al 2013 xu et al 2015 given that functional bacteria such as clostridium ljungdahlii and clostridium kluyveri are enriched caproate may also be beneficially produced from alginate therefore the method proposed in this work provides an alternative to enrich the bacteria for the utilization of complex organic wastes over using a pure culturing technique 4 conclusions the alginate anaerobic hydrolytic bacteria with simultaneous methane production is described in this study and the main outcomes were the cod of methane reached 80 7 of initial alginate cod after considering the biomass cod alginate was totally consumed and the main final metabolites were methane and co2 methanogenesis could promote alginate conversion by ahb when methanogens were totally inhibited poor cod balance was achieved the enriched bacteria were different from the formerly known alginate degradation bacteria the oligo alginate lyase was detected in twelve bacteria by metagenomics and typical carbon metabolic pathways to convert alginate to methane were identified declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

alginate like biomaterial is more than 10 w w of the organic matter in aerobic granular sludge lin et al 2015 alginate is a linear polysaccharide composed of two monomeric units of α l guluronate g and β d mannuronate m thus the conversion of alginate may also promote the hydrolysis of polysaccharides and eps however alginate hydrolytic bacteria ahb are seldom enriched in anaerobic reactors and most studies focus on pure culture wargacki et al 2012 van hal et al 2014 for example sphingomonas sp strain a1 is a soil isolated bacterium that can directly transport alginate into its cytoplasm murata et al 2008 but the degradation percentage kinetics and the yields of metabolites were not described recently a thermophilic bacterium algibacter alginolytica hz22t was enriched from coastal sediment the main metabolites of alginate 20 g l were ethanol 3 5 g l and acetate 3 2 g l after 120 h fermentation but alginate was not fully consumed with a residual alginate amount of 4 5 g l ji et al 2016 compared to pure culture fermentation mixed culture fermentation mcf has the advantage of no sterilization requirement options for continuous fermentation and being adaptive to variations in feedstock or process conditions batstone and virdis 2014 dai et al 2017 moen et al 1997 demonstrated the degradation of alginate and mannitol in mcf the main metabolites were acetate ethanol and butyrate but the enriched bacteria were unclear recently a mesophilic batch reactor was operated to degrade alginate by mcf and the maximum yield of volatile fatty acids vfa including acetate propionate and butyrate reached only 37 1 pham et al 2013 bacteroides and clostridium related microorganisms were identified as the enriched bacteria seon et al 2014 accumulated metabolites such as hydrogen and acetate can inhibit bacterial activity and result in substrate accumulation zhang et al 2012 regueira et al 2018 for example zhang et al 2012 reported that the glucose degrading rate decreased from 27 3 to 19 8 gcod gcod d when hydrogen accumulated in the anaerobic reactor algibacter alginolytica hz22t could not totally consume alginate the remaining percentage was about 23 ji et al 2016 thus removing the accumulated metabolites might reduce the inhibition and promote the alginate conversion methanogens can degrade the fermentation intermediates and improve the bacterial activity for example nobu et al 2015 reported that methanogens could metabolize catabolic by products and detritus of terephthalate ta which consequently facilitated the holistic ta mineralization to co2 and ch4 but currently such reports to improve the activity of ahb are still unknown in mcf disclosing the dominant bacteria by molecular methods is essential for explanation of the reactor performance vanwonterghem et al 2014 combining illumina high throughput sequencing and 16s rrna clone library sequencing could reveal the diversity of enriched microorganisms in mcf vanwonterghem et al 2015 schloss et al 2016 metagenomics is also an important tool to reveal the metabolic pathways in such cultures kouzuma et al 2018 as a result the aim in this study was 1 to enrich the alginate hydrolytic bacteria with methanogens in mcf 2 to reveal the key microbial community members by combining 16s rrna clone library sequencing and illumina miseq high throughput sequencing 3 to demonstrate the anaerobic degradation pathway of alginate by mcf the outcomes will be beneficial for the future production of biochemicals from sludge by mcf 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculum and enriching of alginate hydrolytic bacteria the anaerobic sludge used in this study was collected from a lab scale mesophilic 35 c anaerobic reactor feeding with both ethanol and acetate this inoculum was sparged with n2 of 99 99 for 20 min and then 5 ml was transferred into a serum bottle with a total volume of 120 ml the serum bottle was filled with 40 ml of synthetic inorganic medium in 50 mm phosphate buffer solution ph 7 3 zhang et al 2012 and the medium ingredients in 1 0 l distilled water were as follows nh4cl 500 mg kh2po4 200 mg na2so4 40 mg kcl 50 mg cacl2 10 mg mgcl2 6h2o 70 mg

of serum battle and the headspace were 45 and 75 ml respectively the bottle was sealed with a butyl rubber stopper and an aluminum cap alginate was purchase from aladdin shanghai aladdin bio chem technology co ltd and used as the only organic substrate the 0 1 g of alginate was added at day 0 and then 0 3 g were added at the end of each cycle the temperature was controlled at 35 c with a constant temperature incubator at day 160 the enriched bacteria were transferred to another reactor with working volume of 1 5 l and headspace of 0 5 l the new reactor was provided with fresh medium and 8 0 g l of alginate were added every 10 days till day 360 50 of the total medium was replaced with fresh medium every 30 days to demonstrate the effect of methanogens on alginate converting process after day 360 three alginate concentrations of 1 0 2 5 and 8 0 g l were designed and every experiment was carried out in duplicate group 1 b1 and b2 group 2 b3 and b4 40 ml of broth in the 1 5 l reactor was extracted and added in four serum bottles 40 ml of working volume and 80 ml of headspace 10 mm 2 bromoethane sulfonate bes the methanogenic specific inhibitor was added in group 2 to inhibit the methanogens the serum bottles were purged with n2 for 20 min and sealed with a butyl rubber stopper the serum bottles were cultured in a shaker at 150 rpm and 35 c the gaseous and liquid samples were finally analyzed after 12 days 2 2 metabolite analysis gas samples were taken by a gas tight glass syringe sge australia the hydrogen and methane contents were determined with a gas chromatograph lunan model sp7890 cn equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a 2 m stainless steel column tdx 01 zhang et al 2012 the temperatures of the injector detector and column were kept at 80 100 and 50 c respectively ar was used as the carrier gas the concentrations of ethanol and vfas such as acetate and butyrate were measured by a gas chromatograph agilent 7890 ca with a flame ionization detector and a 10 m 0 53 mm hp ffap fused silica capillary column zhang et al 2012 the samples were pre filtered with 0 45 mm microfilter membrane and then were acidified with 3 v v formic acid before analysis alginate concentration was measured according to jiao et al 2014 at uv254nm by an high performance liquid chromatography system waters 1525 waters usa coupled with a size exclusion chromatography column shodex protein kw 802 5 shoko japan polystyrene sulfonate standards were used to calibrate the retention time for the apparent molecular weight the cod balance calculation was based on the cod of initial alginate and final metabolites the final metabolic yields were calculated in reference to the initial alginate 2 3 characterization of microbial communities 2 3 1 dna extraction the five microbial samples were each collected from initial inoculum and suspending biomass on days 100 160 270 and 360 and were named ahb 0 ahb 100 ahb 160 ahb 270 and ahb 360 respectively each sample was washed with the pbs solution and then dna were extracted according to our former report zhang et al 2016 2 3 2 illumina miseq high throughput sequencing and data analysis the pcr primer of modified 341f modified 806r zhang et al 2016 was used to analyze dna samples of ahb 0 ahb 100 ahb 160 ahb 270 and ahb 360 the amplification was carried out by abi geneamp 9700 majorbio corporation shanghai china sequencing was then performed by an illumina miseq pe 300 high throughput sequencer majorbio corporation shanghai china operational taxonomical units otus were picked to analyze phylogenetically bacterial diversities according to the sequence identity of 97 the sequencing data of the five samples ahb 0 ahb 100 ahb 160 ahb 270 and ahb 360 were deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive under the accession numbers srr5439691 srr5447416 srr5447415 srr5439687 and srr5439688 respectively 2 3 3 16s rrna clone library sequencing and phylogenetic analysis for 16s rrna clone library sequencing the universal primers of bacteria 27f and 1492r and archaea arch20f and arch 958r were used to amplify the dna sample of ahb 360 kröber et al 2009 the amplification was carried out by abi geneamp 9700 majorbio corporation shanghai china then the positive clones were selected and sequenced by the abi prismtm 3730xl dna analyzer majorbio corporation shanghai china the obtained 16s rrna gene sequences were compared with sequences in the genbank database a neighbor joining tree was made with the mega 4 1 beta software in which bootstrap analysis with 5000 replicates was performed to estimate the confidence of the tree topologies 2 3 4 metagenomic analyzing the genomic dna of ahb 360 was analyzed by an illumina hiseq 2000 platform according to the 101 bp paired end strategy majorbio corporation shanghai china sequence reads of low quality or ambiguous were removed and the pair end sequence reads were then merged into tags the average length of tags was about 170 bp the sequencing data were finally deposited in the ncbi under the accession number of samn10583699 3 results and discussion 3 1 alginate degradation in mesophilic mcf the alginate hydrolytic bacteria were enriched within 105 days in a mesophilic repeated batch reactor alginate 0 1 g was added at day 0 and then alginate 0 3 g was added each time when methane partial pressure in the headspace did not notably increase the production of gaseous metabolites including methane hydrogen and co2 from alginate is shown in fig 1 a during the entire experiment hydrogen was not detected nor ph value did the change notably within 7 2 7 3 in the first and second cycles in fig 1a methane contents increased slowly the final methane partial pressures were 0 11 atm day 15 and 0 77 atm day 49 respectively the methane yield increased notably in the following four cycles and the final methane partial pressures were 0 93 atm day 64 6 0 92 atm day 82 0 95 atm day 93 6 and 0 90 atm day 105 respectively in the last four cycles the cod of produced methane was 82 7 2 3 n 4 of the initial alginate cod alginate was converted to biomass in anabolism cod percentage of biomass to substrate in mcf was reported around 8 and even amounted to 18 zhang et al 2014 temudo et al 2007 dai et al 2018 thus a good cod balance 90 was achieved in this study after the initial enrichment fig 1a methane hydrogen co2 and liquid metabolites such as acetate butyrate and ethanol were determined in four subsequent alginate degradation cycles fig 1b acetate was the sole intermediate metabolite in liquid solution other compounds such as ethanol propionate and butyrate were below 0 1 mg l detection limit was 0 1 mg l hydrogen in the headspace was also below 0 01 atm detection limit was 0 01 atm the profiles of methane and acetate production from alginate are shown in fig 1b the final methane partial pressures were 0 91 0 02 atm n 4 acetate accumulated after alginate addition but rapidly declined again within 3 days the peak of accumulated acetate would represent 30 of the added alginate cod the acetate concentration was below detection limit 0 1 mg l during most of the cycle these results demonstrated that the majority of alginate 7 5 g l was degraded with 3 days the cod recovered as methane was 80 7 1 9 n 4 of initial alginate cod after considering the incorporation in biomass cod 8 18 dai et al 2018 a good cod balance of 90 was achieved which indicated that main metabolite of alginate was only methane to demonstrate the alginate consumption alginate ca was also used as the substrate but the enriched bacteria could not consume it and no methane was detected in the headspace supplementary fig s1 after the phosphate was added to remove ca2 from alginate ca alginate was totally consumed again and cod balance reached 82 1 uv254nm was an important factor to determine the alginate concentration supplementary fig s2 kim and dempsey 2013 according to the absorbance profiles at uv254nm the molecular weight spectrum of alginate fig 2 a revealed that the absorbance at 60 000 da was a typical value to analyze alginate degradation fig 2b shows the molecular weight change of alginate in a typical degrading cycle the absorbance of 60 000 da decreased notably and alginate gradually changed to lower molecular weights of 2 668 1 740 and 600 at day 12 the absorbances of those sites were all close to 0 which meant that alginate was totally consumed by mcf to demonstrate the inhibition of intermediates on alginate hydrolytic bacteria bes was added to inhibit methanogens and hydrogen and acetate were identified as the main metabolites and no methane was detected table 1 shows the results of final cod balance in control experiments under the initial alginate concentrations of 1 0 2 5 and 8 0 g l methane was the main metabolite the cod balance was 80 0 1 4 85 1 3 4 and 85 5 7 2 respectively in the experiments with additional bes no methane was detected and acetate and hydrogen were accumulated notably but the cod balance was lowered to 63 5 2 1 65 8 2 7 and 65 5 2 1 respectively and part of alginate was not consumed these results indicated that intermediates of acetate and hydrogen inhibited alginate conversion ji et al 2016 reported that alginate degradation experiments for a thermophilic pure culture that took 5 days when the percentage of residual alginate was higher than 20 therefore our synergistic enrichment of alginate degrading bacteria with methanogens demonstrated better conversion than former studies 3 2 illumina high throughput sequencing of alginate degrading consortium the dna samples including ahb 0 ahb 100 ahb 160 ahb 270 and ahb 360 were analyzed to reveal the diversities of microbial communities by the illumina high throughput sequencing their sequencing indices are shown in supplementary table s1 over 30 000 effective sequences were obtained and the maximum value was amount to 42 000 the mean sequences lengths were above 430 bp the otu number of ahb 0 was 143 after 100 days enriching the values increased to 252 ahb 100 and then decreased to 186 ahb 360 furthermore high coverages all above 0 998 were obtained in this study the curves of shannon index supplementary fig s3 also showed the sequencing depth met the standard to analyze the consortium meanwhile supplementary fig s4 shows that rod shape bacteria dominate the alginate degrading bacteria by sem the phylogenetic levels including domain a and genus b of microbial consortia ahb 0 ahb 100 ahb 160 ahb 270 and ahb 360 are summarized in fig 3 the community changed notably after 360 days of operation at the domain level fig 3a the percentage of bacteria increased from 72 7 ahb 0 to 95 6 ahb 360 fig 3b shows the community diversities at the genus level that norank f synergistaceae 14 1 unclassified o desulfuromonadales 14 3 and norank c w27 15 8 were the main bacteria at the genus level of the inoculum ahb 0 the percentages of these three bacteria however decreased to below 1 0 after 360 day cultivation on the other hand several uncultured bacteria including vadinbc27 wastewater sludge group 13 2 clostridium sensu stricto 1 14 6 lentimicrobium 11 8 and thauera 16 7 were enriched after 360 day cultivation these enriched bacteria were much different from known ahb such as sphingomonas sp strain a1 murata et al 2008 and algibacter alginolytica hz22 t ji et al 2016 the genus vadinbc27 wastewater sludge group belonged to the phylum bacteroidetes that were detected in the anaerobic digesters treating sugars and food wastewater venkiteshwaran et al 2017 lee et al 2017 the genus clostridium sensu stricto 1 was cluster i of the clostridia that can consume many substrates such as glucose mannose and hydrolysis of aesculin lawson and rainey 2016 hahnke et al 2014 lentimicrobium was enriched from anaerobic reactors treating chlorinated solvents polluted wastewater and high strength starch based organic wastewater and the metabolites included acetate hydrogen and butyrate matturro et al 2018 sun et al 2016 thauera generally characterized in the denitrification process to reduce nitrate to gaseous products etchebehere and tiedje 2005 was also enriched in anaerobic digesters to treat waste activated sludge yang et al 2015 baek et al 2016 thus these novel enriched bacteria can be considered as ahb in mcf but further work is still necessary to reveal their functions at the domain level fig 3a the percentage of archaea decreased from 27 3 ahb 0 to 4 4 ahb 360 methanosaeta a typical acetoclastic methanogen chen and he 2015 was the main archaea with an abundance of 24 3 in the sample of ahb 0 after 360 days cultivation this percentage however had decreased to 2 2 at the genus levels other methanogens including methanobacterium hydrogenotrophic methanogen methanoculleus hydrogenotrophic methanogen and methanosarcina both acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogen thauer et al 2008 were also detected in ahb 360 but the percentages were 0 55 0 92 and 0 52 respectively thus these enriched archaea could convert the intermediates of hydrogen and acetate to methane 3 3 16s rrna clone library sequencing of alginate hydrolytic bacteria to reveal the bacterial and archaeal compositions at the species level the 16s rrna clone library sequencing of ahb 360 was analyzed fig 4 fig 4a shows that clostridium quinii strain dsm 6736 26 5 uncultured bacterium clone 72b 26 5 and uncultured bacterium clone ahpd bac2 b09 17 6 were the main detected bacteria in ahb 360 moreover the query cover percentage of lentimicrobium saccharophilum to uncultured bacterium clone ahpd bac2 b09 also amounted to 98 however the percentage of clostridium sensu stricto 1 and lentimicrobium at the genus level was 14 6 and 11 8 by illumina high throughput sequencing respectively and the percentage of thauera phenylacetica was only 2 9 clostridium quinii was isolated from a granular methanogenic sludge reactor uasb from a wastewater treatment plant at a sugar refinery which can convert glucose to metabolites of acetate ethanol and h2 svensson et al 1992 uncultured bacterium clone 72b was obtained from an industrial anaerobic digestor sun et al 2016 recently reported that lentimicrobium saccharophilum was isolated from methanogenic granular sludge and the main metabolites of glucose were acetate propionate formate and hydrogen uncultured bacterium clone ahpd bac2 b09 was also initially identified in lab scale anaerobic bioreactors for auto generative high pressure digestion the percentage of other colons including uncultured bacterium clone vhw d r9 cellulosilyticum lentocellum and mariniphaga anaerophila were all below 10 these enriched bacteria were much different from known ahb of sphingomonas sp strain a1 and algibacter alginolytica hz22 t thus this key bacterium to hydrolyze alginate was still unclear for acetoclastic methanogens the percentage of methanosaeta genus including m harundinacea and m concilii was 27 6 fig 4b for hydrogenotrophic methanogens methanoculleus sediminis was enriched and the percentage was 24 1 methanosarcina mazei which was characterized to be both acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogen was also detected and the percentage was 10 3 these enriched archaea were also identified by illumina high throughput sequencing which could convert the intermediates both hydrogen and acetate of alginate to methane however the function of uncultured crenarchaeote clone ar3102 36 7 was unclear liu et al 2011 reported that it was initially enriched from an anaerobic sludge digester thus this main methanogen also can produce methane from the intermediates of alginate 3 4 metagenomic analysis since the alginate hydrolytic bacteria was not identified by illumina high throughput sequencing and 16s rrna clone library sequencing the sample of ahb 360 was further analyzed by metagenomic analysis by a metagenomics analysis table 2 twelve bacteria species including algibacter lectus bacteroides clarus and bacteroides fragilis could produce oligo alginate lyase to degrade alginate to monomers but were not detected by 16s rrna clone library and high throughput sequencing which meant that the percentage of these bacteria were rather low and further studies are also necessary to enrich these bacteria it shall be noted that algibacter lectus is identified as a novel genus of algibacter that can degrade alginate to acetate and hydrogen nedashkovskaya et al 2004 which is related to the well known alginate hydrolytic bacterium of algibacter alginolytica hz22t the full metabolic pathways of these monomers were detected by metagenomic analysis supplementary fig s5 in which the final metabolites of alginate degradation were methane and co2 this result was consistent with the experimental results from fig 1 3 5 biological process to convert alginate to methane in mcf since the otu number of ahb 360 was about 186 by illumina high throughput sequencing it was hard to summarize the function of all enriched bacteria in ahb 360 thus according to the results of 16s rrna clone library sequencing high throughput sequencing and metagenomic analysis the biological process of converting alginate to methane is proposed in fig 5 alginate was first hydrolyzed to two monomeric units of α l guluronate g and β d mannuronate m by oligo alginate lyase g and m were converted to acetate and hydrogen by genera of vadinbc27 wastewater sludge group clostridium sensu stricto 1 and lentimicrobium in which pyruvate was produced through embden meyerhof parnas emp and entner doudoroff ed pathways the intermediates of acetate and hydrogen were finally converted to methane by acetoclastic methanogens of methanosaeta and methanosarcina and hydrogenotrophic methanogens of methanobacterium methanoculleus and methanosarcina it is also noted that wang et al 2016 reported ed was the main pathway to convert guluronate and mannuronate to pyruvate however in the present study both ed and emp pathways were detected as a result more procedures such as bacteria isolating and metabolic pathways analyzing by single cell genomic and metatranscriptomic analyses are still needed in the future 3 6 perspective of alginate degrading bacteria conversion of organic substrates such as sludge to biofuels and chemicals by mcf is an alternative to traditional petroleum related production eps is important for protection of sludge cells against harmful substances or adverse environments but it also can affect the sludge disintegration rate desmond et al 2018 gagliano et al 2015 thus the hydrolysis is the rate limiting step because of the extracellular polymeric substances eps and hard cell wall zhen et al 2017 recently the biological pretreatment such as a amylase and protease stands out for economic and safety reasons for converting sludge lü et al 2016 teo and wong 2014 for example xin et al 2016 used the hydrolytic enzymes blend lysozyme a amylase protease and cellulase to digest was and the main results showed that soluble cod protein and carbohydrate in solution presented a substantial increase up to about 6000 9000 mg l 1500 3000 mg l and 550 700 mg l lü et al 2016 found that polygalacturonic acid like matter hydrolysis caused significant release of polysaccharides but the temperature and ph adjustment were necessary to maintain the enzyme activity teo and wong 2014 also proposed that low enzymatic activities were probably due to the instability of free enzymes in the bioreactor environment lin et al 2015 reviewed that an alginate like biomaterial was more than 10 w w of the organic matter in aerobic granular sludge in this study we enriched a mixed culture that could convert alginate to methane which provide a new method for sludge utilization to be verified in the future moreover it is known that eps is a complex structure that includes lb eps tb eps and sb eps its degradation also changes sludge properties such as dewatering svennevik et al 2019 the protein and humics in real sludge may also affect the activity of enriched ahb thus future studies for the application of ahb in sludge utilization will be performed the traditional substrates sucrose and glucose raise the food vs fuel debate and the human dependent land use saladini et al 2016 the lignocellulose biomass is currently considered to be an important substrate for biofuels production but lignin is resistant to microbial degradation zhang et al 2013 abubackar et al 2011 aquatic cultured feedstocks are the ideal substrates for the third generation biofuels production saladini et al 2016 marine algae are especially considered to be an untapped source that offer many benefits over the substrates for first and second generation biofuels such as starch glucose or lignocellulose biomass because of abundant carbohydrate contents low lignin contents the absence of conflicts with food production and lower total cost domozych 2006 lehahn et al 2016 lehahn et al 2016 predicted that third generation biofuels derived from macroalgae can provide the total energy of 18 1015 kj year which has the potential to fully displace the use of fossil fuels in the transportation sector alginate is the major matrix component of the brown algal cell wall which may constitute up to 30 60 of the dry weight of the brown algae domozych 2006 thus the efficient degradation of alginate from both sludge and marine algae by mcf might be an essential aspect of the bio based economy in this study alginate could be completely consumed for methane production by mcf which offers an important pathway for utilization of marine algae moreover once methanogenesis is inhibited in mcf the intermediates such as acetate or hydrogen will accumulate which are also important biofuels and chemicals recently production of medium chain fatty acids such as caproate from cellulosic substrate and glycerol raises increased attentions due to their better fuel value and easier separation from the fermentation broth zhang et al 2013 xu et al 2015 given that functional bacteria such as clostridium ljungdahlii and clostridium kluyveri are enriched caproate may also be beneficially produced from alginate therefore the method proposed in this work provides an alternative to enrich the bacteria for the utilization of complex organic wastes over using a pure culturing technique 4 conclusions the alginate anaerobic hydrolytic bacteria with simultaneous methane production is described in this study and the main outcomes were the cod of methane reached 80 7 of initial alginate cod after considering the biomass cod alginate was totally consumed and the main final metabolites were methane and co2 methanogenesis could promote alginate conversion by ahb when methanogens were totally inhibited poor cod balance was achieved the enriched bacteria were different from the formerly known alginate degradation bacteria the oligo alginate lyase was detected in twelve bacteria by metagenomics and typical carbon metabolic pathways to convert alginate to methane were identified declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

18606,recovering materials with high value and increasing market demand from sewage and or sludge is becoming more attractive than recovering traditional resources such as nutrients and biogas sulfated polysaccharides sps are valuable and scarce raw materials that can only be produced from marine algae and a few types of animal tissues this study evaluated if sps are present in activated sludge obtained from saline sewage with a high level of sulfates present the presence of sps containing extracellular polymeric substances eps was confirmed and quantified for both sludge from lab scale reactors and full scale plants for the first time sps in the sludge of a lab scale reactor operated under alternating aerobic anoxic conditions with 500 mg l sulfate in the influent which is typical of hong kong saline sewage reached 342 8 0 3 mg gvss and sludge taken from a full scale saline wastewater treatment plant wwtp contained 418 1 0 4 mg gvss of sps purity of the extracted sps was comparable to that of commercial industrial grade products key bioactivities of sps i e fucoidan carrageenan and heparin namely anti angiogenesis anticoagulant and antioxidant were confirmed after extraction and purification interestingly operating conditions had a strong influence on the contents and types of sps synthesized in sludge as well as its bioactivities although the detailed synthetic pathways of sps in activated sludge remain unclear the current study has made a first attempt to recover a high value scarce resource from biological wastewater treatment graphical abstract

angiogenesis bioactivity of sps extracted from the biomass fertilized eggs were incubated in an incubator at 37 c with 80 humidity at day 3 3 ml of albumen were removed through a window cut to minimize adhesion of the shell membrane to the cam the opening was sealed with paraffin film to prevent dehydration and the eggs were returned for further incubation at day 9 another window cut of 1 1

determined to be 662 6 nm for chlorophyll a 3 results and discussion 3 1 sps characterization 3 1 1 sps quantification total sps contents of the six sludge samples s1 to s6 were 0 342 79 0 3 202 89 0 2 74 07 0 6 94 19 0 2 and 418 08 0 4 mg gvss as determined by the toluidine blue o method with fucoidan as reference standard the reported content of sps in marine algae ranges from 4 to 76 depending on polysaccharide type kim 2016 while total sps measured in the current study accounted for 7 42 of the dry weight of biomass on the basis of mlvss sps were undetectable in s1 which was subsequently excluded from sps analysis specific sps species were identified and quantified using uplc as shown in fig 1 with a focus on fucoidan carrageenan and heparin the three most widely used sps species detailed contents of carrageenan fucoidan and heparin of five sludge samples were quantified based on uplc analysis as shown in table 2 total contents of carrageenan fucoidan and heparin only accounted for around 50 of the total sps extracted from sludge samples and the remainder was shown to be mainly alginate based on the weights of precipitates formed in the alginate removal step during sps extraction fig s1 carrageenan fucoidan and heparin were all detected in s2 and s6 but fucoidan was undetectable in s4 and s5 and heparin was absent from s3 and s4 such results illustrate that biomass consisting of multiple organisms s2 s3 and s6 produced not only larger amounts of sps but also more diverse sps species than those sludge samples dominated by a simple population s4 and s5 interestingly the sludge samples dominated by sulfur metabolic organisms i e sulfate reducing bacteria srb and sulfur oxidizing bacteria sob possessed lower sps contents than the other sludge samples formation of sps starts with synthesis of a polysaccharide chain followed by sulfation of secondary organic metabolites evans et al 1973 a high concentration of exogenous sulfide could inhibit sps synthesis in both steps due to the inactivation of enzymes involved in polysaccharide synthesis such as udp glucose 6 dehydrogenase and glutamine synthetase which would lose activity in the presence of sulfide romero et al 2013 in addition inhibition effects of exogenous sulfide on sulfate assimilatory metabolism by direct incorporation of sulfide into cysteine brunold and erismann 1975 as well as diverse sulfotransferase birke et al 2015 which facilitates the incorporation of sulfate into polysaccharides were commonly reported in this work 120 mg l sulfide and 100 mg l sulfide were detected in reactors dominated by srb s4 and sob s5 respectively although a considerable amount of sulfide was also produced at the end of anaerobic stage in s2 a complete disappearance was noticed in the subsequent aerobic stage xue et al 2017 whether the presence of sulfide inhibits the activities of the aforementioned major enzymes involved in sps synthesis deserves further investigation gel filtration was conducted in an fplc system as shown in fig 2 for further analysis and fractionation of different sps species results verified the presence of heparin fucoidan and carrageenan in extracts of s2 and s6 as well as some other compounds with similar chemical structures indicated by peaks nearby however extracts of s3 s4 and s5 lacked either fucoidan or heparin or both which agrees with results of uplc analysis representative peaks of heparin fucoidan and carrageenan were composed of several overlapping peaks indicating diverse molecular weights and sulfation degrees therefore sec was further performed and the monosaccharide components analyzed 3 1 2 molecular weight and monosaccharide components molecular weights and monosaccharide components of sps extracted from s2 and s6 characterized by the most diverse sps species were analyzed the main peak of the s2 extract in sec had a retention time of 14 270 min with an average molecular weight of 483 9 kda peaks of the s6 extract were located at 14 507 min and 16 362 min with average molecular weights of 371 2 kda and 46 6 kda respectively fig 3 whereas raw sps from marine algae have high molecular weights the molecular weights of sps from activated sludge were situated in the low to medium range which is favorable for their downstream processing because low molecular weight sps are usually more valuable with wider applications in addition sps with low to medium molecular weights are more likely to possess stronger bioactivities and chemical properties owing to their permeability through multiple cell membrane barriers and higher specific number of functional groups fang 1994 zhou et al 2014 monosaccharide components of s2 and s6 extracts were analyzed after degradation as shown in table 3 glucose glc and galactose gal were the dominant monosaccharide species in both the s2 and s6 extracts with glucose accounting for 20 9 and 51 0 of all monosaccharide species in s2 and s6 respectively and galactose accounting for 13 3 and 27 9 contents of glucosamine glcn rhamnose rha and fucose fuc were also relatively high in these two extracts reaching 13 2 13 1 and 4 6 in s2 respectively and 3 6 3 2 and 8 8 in s6 such monosaccharide components are highly similar to those of sps produced in marine algae huxtable 1986 3 1 3 metal content analysis as sps can be considered as a metal sink due to the existence of high affinity binding sites to metals such as carboxylates amines and thiols their chemical properties and application potential are highly subjected to their metal contents souza et al 2006 in total 18 kinds of common metal ions were examined in this work only five metals were detectable at low concentrations less than 0 9 mg g sps except for ferric and manganese in the extracts of s6 and s4 as shown in table 4 the high ferric content in s6 which was taken from a local wastewater treatment plant could be due to the addition of a ferric coagulant 3 3 mg fe l in primary treatment dsp 2004 although the metal contents of all extracts met the quality standard of industrial grade sps in china sc t 3401 2006 methods for metal removal such as ionic exchange and acidic extraction are still essential for the practical application of sps in other fields such as pet food agriculture and cosmetics where the total allowable metal contents are 10 100 times below those of the current extracts 3 2 bio activities assay 3 2 1 anti angiogenesis activity anti angiogenesis activity of fractionated sps extracts was analyzed in cam tests fig 4 shows a typical cam test of the control group and five anti angiogenesis active groups maturities of blood vessel networks were compared after sps injection and incubation followed by the transfer of fertilized eggs onto petri dishes results of cam tests of the sps species without anti angiogenesis activity i e fucoidan of s2 s3 and s6 carrageenan of s4 and s5 and heparin of s5 are shown in fig s2 the formation of blood vessel networks in cams was terminated with injection of the heparin and carrageenan fractions from s2 and s6 as well as the carrageenan fraction from s3 on the contrary formation of mature blood vessel networks in the cams was not affected in the control or in other tested eggs injected with other null sps extraction fractions the sps fractions added to positive groups may possess inhibitory effects on basic fibroblast growth factor bfgf and vascular endothelial growth factor vegf due to their chemical structures which influences the binding of these factors to their receptors qi et al 2005 thus causing tissue recession however fucoidan fractions in this study showed no anti angiogenic effect which is contrary to the consensus that both natural and over sulfated fucoidan are anti angiogenic yang et al 2017 this result was likely due to changes in the chemical structure of fucoidan extracted from sludge caused by impurities 3 2 2 anticoagulant activity anticoagulant activities of fractionated sps extracts from each sludge sample were examined by measuring their aptt carrageenan fractions extracted from all s2 s6 sludge samples showed anticoagulant activity as shown in fig 5 the time required to form clots was at least doubled when 10 μl of carrageenan were added the carrageenan extracted from s2 exhibited a clotting time of 125 3 s which is five times longer than that of the control the carrageenan extracted from s6 had the next longest clotting time 117 2 s fucoidan fractions also showed anticoagulant activities albeit weaker than those of carrageenan fractions while heparin showed almost no anticoagulant activity 3 2 3 antioxidant activity antioxidant activity of fractionated sps extracts was investigated based on their dpph and deoxyribose radical scavenging effects as shown in fig 6 carrageenan and fucoidan fractions of the s2 to s6 extracts demonstrated antioxidant activity with scavenging effect ranging from 15 to 35 carrageenan showed higher antioxidant activity as fucan fraction which is abundant in fucoidan has only moderate or even no antioxidant effect koyanagi et al 2003 heparin in s1 s5 and s6 exhibited no antioxidant bioactivity carrageenan extracted from s2 and s6 showed superior antioxidant activity in comparison with that extracted from s4 and s5 this is likely explained by the inhibition of galactose 6 sulfurylase resulting in the reduced synthesis of kappa carrageenan the only antioxidative species among all carrageenan isomerides under a high content of sulfide 3 3 chlorophyll a analysis algae are primarily aquatic autotrophic photosynthetic organisms that exist commonly in all kinds of water bodies sen et al 2013 to exclude the possibility that the sps were produced from algae in the sludge samples contents of chlorophyll a were tested in all sludge samples s2 to s6 chlorophyll a was not detectable in s2 to s5 while 0 00075 mg l chlorophyll a was found in s6 as shown in fig s3 presence of chlorophyll a in s6 possibly resulted from marine algae in seawater due to infiltration and the practice of seawater toilet flushing in hong kong whose coastal waters contain around 0 002 0 02 mg l chlorophyll a chen et al 2002 based on the findings the microorganisms are the only contributors to sps production in s2 to s5 while marine algae contributed very little to the sps production in s6 3 4 purity comparison with commercial raw sps purity of sps extracted from sludge was evaluated through comparison with commercial industrial grade sps this method is commonly used in industrial grade sps production as a quality control approach fplc comparison of sps extracted from s6 with the industrial standard is shown in fig 7 heparin peaks elution volume of 26 28 3 ml of two sps samples exhibited strong overlaps while peaks representative of fucoidan and carrageenan elution volume of 15 19 8 ml and 20 25 ml of commercial raw sps were vastly different from those of s6 indicating that sps produced from sludge have more complex chemical structures and higher sulfation degrees this is likely because sludge has a more complex microbial community or a greater number of metabolic pathways than algae however the lower purity and more complex chemical structure of sps from sludge do not detract from their chemical properties in fact sps from sludge are suitable for industrial applications such as dyeing rubber processing and paper making and as a coating agent however it is essential to identify and remove trace impurities as well as to modify the structure of sps in order to produce high purity sps for other applications 3 5 outlook for sps recovery from sludge producing sps from sludge even if the resulting sps are only of industrial grade is attractive driven by increasing market demand and the limited number of ways to produce sps the demand for and price of sps regardless of purity are constantly increasing the demand of industrial grade sps has been expanding at an annual rate of 2 4 in the last decade huxtable 1986 besides the increasing global needs the high costs of algae cultivation due to the tremendous amount of energy consumed for water and co2 pumping biomass dewatering and concentration davis et al 2016 have also resulted in the expensive industrial grade sps production according to a report from the u s national renewable energy laboratory the operating cost incurred in the production of 1 ton of sps assuming the sps content in algae is 70 of their dry weight via algae cultivation in an open pond system was at least 1080 usd davis et al 2016 and this figure does not even include the huge construction cost of the cultivation system to boost algae cultivation addition of nutrients mainly ammonia and phosphorus is essential resulting in the production of aquaculture wastewater in addition every ton of dried marine algae must be mixed with around 40 tons of water in traditional algae based sps production processes tian et al 2011 biological wastewater treatment processes own some similarities in terms of operating conditions and material characteristics as algae based sps production as in algae cultivation air pumping biomass dewatering and concentration are commonly used in biological wastewater treatment coupled with sludge disposal even the water content of algae slurry 97 5 is similar to that of excess sludge from secondary sedimentation tanks hence producing sps from activated sludge whose treatment cost accounts for 40 of the total operating cost of a sewage treatment plant can potentially alleviate the insufficient sps supply by reducing the reliance on algae for sps production the present results illustrated that sludge exposed to sufficient sulfate under alternating anoxic aerobic condition which is the case for saline sewage treatment in hong kong and wwtps using modified ludzack ettinger mle process in coastal cities could be suitable for sps recovery without jeopardizing their mainstream process and treatment efficacy therefore transforming the production of sps even if they are only of industrial grade from using natural macroorganisms to using activated sludge could be economically advantageous due to the elimination of algae cultivation and processing costs in addition enhanced dewaterability of the sewage sludge after sps extraction data not shown favors subsequent sludge disposal however there is still a long way to go to make the effective recovery of sps happen detailed chemical structures production mechanisms and methods for further purification have not been established in the present work it has been shown that the amounts of sps produced from sludge is considerable and they test positive in various bioactivity tests demonstrating the bioactivity of sps derived from activated sludge opens a door not only for scientific research on sps biosynthetic pathways in microbes but also for recovery technology of these potential high value compounds a novel approach for recovering high value resources could be developed on the basis of the present and future findings 4 conclusions this study discovered the presence of several bio active sps including fucoidan carrageenan and heparin with considerable amounts for recovery in the eps of sludge grown in sulfate laden wastewater purities and key bio activities of sludge recovered sps were comparable to those of commercial raw sps produced from marine algae alternating aerobic anoxic operating condition favored sps synthesis while sulfate reduction and sulfide oxidation condition inhibited the production of sps due to high level of external sulfide current findings shed lights on both sps recovery from sludge a novel resource recovery approach with superior economic value and studies on sps

18606,recovering materials with high value and increasing market demand from sewage and or sludge is becoming more attractive than recovering traditional resources such as nutrients and biogas sulfated polysaccharides sps are valuable and scarce raw materials that can only be produced from marine algae and a few types of animal tissues this study evaluated if sps are present in activated sludge obtained from saline sewage with a high level of sulfates present the presence of sps containing extracellular polymeric substances eps was confirmed and quantified for both sludge from lab scale reactors and full scale plants for the first time sps in the sludge of a lab scale reactor operated under alternating aerobic anoxic conditions with 500 mg l sulfate in the influent which is

was comparable to that of commercial industrial grade products key bioactivities of sps i e fucoidan carrageenan and heparin namely anti angiogenesis anticoagulant and antioxidant were confirmed after extraction and purification interestingly operating conditions had a strong influence on the contents and types of sps synthesized in sludge as well as its bioactivities although the detailed synthetic pathways of sps in activated sludge remain unclear the current study has made a first attempt to recover a high value scarce resource from biological wastewater treatment graphical abstract

sampriti et al 2016 therefore attention has turned to the recovery of resources with both high economic value and market demand sulfated polysaccharides sps are sulfur containing macromolecules and major constituents of the extracellular structures of salinity sulfate resistant microorganisms huxtable 1986 the sps family comprises a broad spectrum of polysaccharides varying in monosaccharide

generally grown in low sulfate containing media or sewage a tailed analysis of sps is yet to be conducted this study was designed to investigate sps species quantities and bioactivities including anti angiogenesis anticoagulant and antioxidant activities in six different types of sludge cultivated in different operational conditions results focused on sps recovery from saline sludge with disparate

the economic incentives of sps production overall this study not only explores a potential new source of sps but also opens up the possibility of recovering high value resources from sludge in general 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge samples six sludge samples were investigated in this study among which five s1 to s5 were collected from different lab scale reactors and one s6 was taken from a local saline sewage treatment plant five lab scale reactors were operated under different conditions table 1 for the enrichment of sludge samples with different microbial communities s6 was taken from a local modified ludzack ettinger saline sewage treatment plant in sha tin hong kong with an influent sulfate concentration of 550 mg so4 2 l and an average solids retention time of 11 days synthetic

angiogenesis bioactivity of sps extracted from the biomass fertilized eggs were incubated in an incubator at 37 c with 80 humidity at day 3 3 ml of albumen were removed through a window cut to minimize adhesion of the shell membrane to the cam the opening was sealed with paraffin film to prevent dehydration and the eggs were returned for further incubation at day 9 another window cut of 1 1 cm was opened at the top of chorioallantoic membrane in all eggs one hundred μ l of fractionated sps extracts were injected into 11 eggs through the window while the control was treated with an injection of double distilled water all eggs were then incubated under the same condition for another 3 days after closing all openings with paraffin film testing eggs were cracked open and

fraction was determined as absorbance of blank absorbance of test absorbance of blank 100 2 4 4 deoxyribose radical scavenging activity assay deoxyribose radical scavenging activity assay of each

determined to be 662 6 nm for chlorophyll a 3 results and discussion 3 1 sps characterization 3 1 1 sps quantification total sps contents of the six sludge samples s1 to s6 were 0 342 79 0 3 202 89 0 2 74 07 0 6 94 19 0 2 and 418 08 0 4 mg gvss as determined by the toluidine blue o method with fucoidan as reference standard the reported content of sps in marine algae ranges from 4 to 76 depending on polysaccharide type kim 2016 while total sps measured in the current study accounted for 7 42 of the dry weight of biomass on the basis of mlvss sps were undetectable in s1 which was subsequently excluded from sps analysis specific sps species were identified and quantified using uplc as shown in fig 1 with a focus on fucoidan carrageenan and heparin the three most widely used sps species detailed contents of carrageenan fucoidan and heparin of five sludge samples were quantified based on uplc analysis as shown in table 2 total contents of carrageenan fucoidan and heparin only accounted for around 50 of the total sps extracted from sludge samples and the remainder was shown to be mainly alginate based on the weights of precipitates formed in the alginate removal step during sps extraction fig s1 carrageenan fucoidan and heparin were all detected in s2 and s6 but fucoidan was undetectable in s4 and s5 and heparin was absent from s3 and s4 such results illustrate that biomass consisting of multiple organisms s2 s3 and s6 produced not only larger amounts of sps but also more diverse sps species than those sludge samples dominated by a simple population s4 and s5 interestingly the sludge samples dominated by sulfur metabolic organisms i e sulfate reducing bacteria srb and sulfur oxidizing bacteria sob possessed lower sps contents than the other sludge samples formation of sps starts with synthesis of a polysaccharide chain followed by sulfation of secondary organic metabolites evans et al 1973 a high concentration of exogenous sulfide could inhibit sps synthesis in both steps due to the inactivation of enzymes involved in polysaccharide synthesis such as udp glucose 6 dehydrogenase and glutamine synthetase which would lose activity in the presence of sulfide romero et al 2013 in addition inhibition effects of exogenous sulfide on sulfate assimilatory metabolism by direct incorporation of sulfide into cysteine brunold and erismann 1975 as well as diverse sulfotransferase birke et al 2015 which facilitates the incorporation of sulfate into polysaccharides were commonly reported in this work 120 mg l sulfide and 100 mg l sulfide were detected in reactors dominated by srb s4 and sob s5 respectively although a considerable amount of sulfide was also produced at the end of anaerobic stage in s2 a complete disappearance was noticed in the subsequent aerobic stage xue et al 2017 whether the presence of sulfide inhibits the activities of the aforementioned major enzymes involved in sps synthesis deserves further investigation gel filtration was conducted in an fplc system as shown in fig 2 for further analysis and fractionation of different sps species results verified the presence of heparin fucoidan and carrageenan in extracts of s2 and s6 as well as some other compounds with similar chemical structures indicated by peaks nearby however extracts of s3 s4 and s5 lacked either fucoidan or heparin or both which agrees with results of uplc analysis representative peaks of heparin fucoidan and carrageenan were composed of several overlapping peaks indicating diverse molecular weights and sulfation degrees therefore sec was further performed and the monosaccharide components analyzed 3 1 2 molecular weight and monosaccharide components molecular weights and monosaccharide components of sps extracted from s2 and s6 characterized by the most diverse sps species were analyzed the main peak of the s2 extract in sec had a retention time of 14 270 min with an average molecular weight of 483 9 kda peaks of the s6 extract were located at 14 507 min and 16 362 min with average molecular weights of 371 2 kda and 46 6 kda respectively fig 3 whereas raw sps from marine algae have high molecular weights the molecular weights of sps from activated sludge were situated in the low to medium range which is favorable for their downstream processing because low molecular weight sps are usually more valuable with wider applications in addition sps with low to medium molecular weights are more likely to possess stronger bioactivities and chemical properties owing to their permeability through multiple cell membrane barriers and higher specific number of functional groups fang 1994 zhou et al 2014 monosaccharide components of s2 and s6 extracts were analyzed after degradation as shown in table 3 glucose glc and galactose gal were the dominant monosaccharide species in both the s2 and s6 extracts with glucose accounting for 20 9 and 51 0 of all monosaccharide species in s2 and s6 respectively and galactose accounting for 13 3 and 27 9 contents of glucosamine glcn rhamnose rha and fucose fuc were also relatively high in these two extracts reaching 13 2 13 1 and 4 6 in s2 respectively and 3 6 3 2 and 8 8 in s6 such monosaccharide components are highly similar to those of sps produced in marine algae huxtable 1986 3 1 3 metal content analysis as sps can be considered as a metal sink due to the existence of high affinity binding sites to metals such as carboxylates amines and thiols their chemical properties and application potential are highly subjected to their metal contents souza et al 2006 in total 18 kinds of common metal ions were examined in this work only five metals were detectable at low concentrations less than 0 9 mg g sps except for ferric and manganese in the extracts of s6 and s4 as shown in table 4 the high ferric content in s6 which was taken from a local wastewater treatment plant could be due to the addition of a ferric coagulant 3 3 mg fe l in primary treatment dsp 2004 although the metal contents of all extracts met the quality standard of industrial grade sps in china sc t 3401 2006 methods for metal removal such as ionic exchange and acidic extraction are still essential for the practical application of sps in other fields such as pet food agriculture and cosmetics where the total allowable metal contents are 10 100 times below those of the current extracts 3 2 bio activities assay 3 2 1 anti angiogenesis activity anti angiogenesis activity of fractionated sps extracts was analyzed in cam tests fig 4 shows a typical cam test of the control group and five anti angiogenesis active groups maturities of blood vessel networks were compared after sps injection and incubation followed by the transfer of fertilized eggs onto petri dishes results of cam tests of the sps species without anti angiogenesis activity i e fucoidan of s2 s3 and s6 carrageenan of s4 and s5 and heparin of s5 are shown in fig s2 the formation of blood vessel networks in cams was terminated with injection of the heparin and carrageenan fractions from s2 and s6 as well as the carrageenan fraction from s3 on the contrary formation of mature blood vessel networks in the cams was not affected in the control or in other tested eggs injected with other null sps extraction fractions the sps fractions added to positive groups may possess inhibitory effects on basic fibroblast growth factor bfgf and vascular endothelial growth factor vegf due to their chemical structures which influences the binding of these factors to their receptors qi et al 2005 thus causing tissue recession however fucoidan fractions in this study showed no anti angiogenic effect which is contrary to the consensus that both natural and over sulfated fucoidan are anti angiogenic yang et al 2017 this result was likely due to changes in the chemical structure of fucoidan extracted from sludge caused by impurities 3 2 2 anticoagulant activity anticoagulant activities of fractionated sps extracts from each sludge sample were examined by measuring their aptt carrageenan fractions extracted from all s2 s6 sludge samples showed anticoagulant activity as shown in fig 5 the time required to form clots was at least doubled when 10 μl of carrageenan were added the carrageenan extracted from s2 exhibited a clotting time of 125 3 s which is five times longer than that of the control the carrageenan extracted from s6 had the next longest clotting time 117 2 s fucoidan fractions also showed anticoagulant activities albeit weaker than those of carrageenan fractions while heparin showed almost no anticoagulant activity 3 2 3 antioxidant activity antioxidant activity of fractionated sps extracts was investigated based on their dpph and deoxyribose radical scavenging effects as shown in fig 6 carrageenan and fucoidan fractions of the s2 to s6 extracts demonstrated antioxidant activity with scavenging effect ranging from 15 to 35 carrageenan showed higher antioxidant activity as fucan fraction which is abundant in fucoidan has only moderate or even no antioxidant effect koyanagi et al 2003 heparin in s1 s5 and s6 exhibited no antioxidant bioactivity carrageenan extracted from s2 and s6 showed superior antioxidant activity in comparison with that extracted from s4 and s5 this is likely explained by the inhibition of galactose 6 sulfurylase resulting in the reduced synthesis of kappa carrageenan the only antioxidative species among all carrageenan isomerides under a high content of sulfide 3 3 chlorophyll a analysis algae are primarily aquatic autotrophic photosynthetic organisms that exist commonly in all kinds of water bodies sen et al 2013 to exclude the possibility that the sps were produced from algae in the sludge samples contents of chlorophyll a were tested in all sludge samples s2 to s6 chlorophyll a was not detectable in s2 to s5 while 0 00075 mg l chlorophyll a was found in s6 as shown in fig s3 presence of chlorophyll a in s6 possibly resulted from marine algae in seawater due to infiltration and the practice of seawater toilet flushing in hong kong whose coastal waters contain around 0 002 0 02 mg l chlorophyll a chen et al 2002 based on the findings the microorganisms are the only contributors to sps production in s2 to s5 while marine algae contributed very little to the sps production in s6 3 4 purity comparison with commercial raw sps purity of sps extracted from sludge was evaluated through comparison with commercial industrial grade sps this method is commonly used in industrial grade sps production as a quality control approach fplc comparison of sps extracted from s6 with the industrial standard is shown in fig 7 heparin peaks elution volume of 26 28 3 ml of two sps samples exhibited strong overlaps while peaks representative of fucoidan and carrageenan elution volume of 15 19 8 ml and 20 25 ml of commercial raw sps were vastly different from those of s6 indicating that sps produced from sludge have more complex chemical structures and higher sulfation degrees this is likely because sludge has a more complex microbial community or a greater number of metabolic pathways than algae however the lower purity and more complex chemical structure of sps from sludge do not detract from their chemical properties in fact sps from sludge are suitable for industrial applications such as dyeing rubber processing and paper making and as a coating agent however it is essential to identify and remove trace impurities as well as to modify the structure of sps in order to produce high purity sps for other applications 3 5 outlook for sps recovery from sludge producing sps from sludge even if the resulting sps are only of industrial grade is attractive driven by increasing market demand and the limited number of ways to produce sps the demand for and price of sps regardless of purity are constantly increasing the demand of industrial grade sps has been expanding at an annual rate of 2 4 in the last decade huxtable 1986 besides the increasing global needs the high costs of algae cultivation due to the tremendous amount of energy consumed for water and co2 pumping biomass dewatering and concentration davis et al 2016 have also resulted in the expensive industrial grade sps production according to a report from the u s national renewable energy laboratory the operating cost incurred in the production of 1 ton of sps assuming the sps content in algae is 70 of their dry weight via algae cultivation in an open pond system was at least 1080 usd davis et al 2016 and this figure does not even include the huge construction cost of the cultivation system to boost algae cultivation addition of nutrients mainly ammonia and phosphorus is essential resulting in the production of aquaculture wastewater in addition every ton of dried marine algae must be mixed with around 40 tons of water in traditional algae based sps production processes tian et al 2011 biological wastewater treatment processes own some similarities in terms of operating conditions and material characteristics as algae based sps production as in algae cultivation air pumping biomass dewatering and concentration are commonly used in biological wastewater treatment coupled with sludge disposal even the water content of algae slurry 97 5 is similar to that of excess sludge from secondary sedimentation tanks hence producing sps from activated sludge whose treatment cost accounts for 40 of the total operating cost of a sewage treatment plant can potentially alleviate the insufficient sps supply by reducing the reliance on algae for sps production the present results illustrated that sludge exposed to sufficient sulfate under alternating anoxic aerobic condition which is the case for saline sewage treatment in hong kong and wwtps using modified ludzack ettinger mle process in coastal cities could be suitable for sps recovery without jeopardizing their mainstream process and treatment efficacy therefore transforming the production of sps even if they are only of industrial grade from using natural macroorganisms to using activated sludge could be economically advantageous due to the elimination of algae cultivation and processing costs in addition enhanced dewaterability of the sewage sludge after sps extraction data not shown favors subsequent sludge disposal however there is still a long way to go to make the effective recovery of sps happen detailed chemical structures production mechanisms and methods for further purification have not been established in the present work it has been shown that the amounts of sps produced from sludge is considerable and they test positive in various bioactivity tests demonstrating the bioactivity of sps derived from activated sludge opens a door not only for scientific research on sps biosynthetic pathways in microbes but also for recovery technology of these potential high value compounds a novel approach for recovering high value resources could be developed on the basis of the present and future findings 4 conclusions this study discovered the presence of several bio active sps including fucoidan carrageenan and heparin with considerable amounts for recovery in the eps of sludge grown in sulfate laden wastewater purities and key bio activities of sludge recovered sps were comparable to those of commercial raw sps produced from marine algae alternating aerobic anoxic operating condition favored sps synthesis while sulfate reduction and sulfide oxidation condition inhibited the production of sps due to high level of external sulfide current findings shed lights on both sps recovery from sludge a novel resource recovery approach with superior economic value and studies on sps

18607,the effects of three commonly bioavailable nitrogen n sources nitrate ammonium and urea on regulating the growth and microcystins mcs production of microcystis aeruginosa m aeruginosa at environmentally relevant concentrations were investigated from a physiological perspective changes in amino acid quotas as well as the transcripts of target genes associated with n metabolism ntca pipx and glnb and toxin formation mcya and mcyd were determined results indicated that increases in nitrate and urea concentrations enhanced m aeruginosa growth but high ammonium concentration 7 mg n

associated with mcs production ammonium favors amino acid synthesis in m aeruginosa thus cells grown under high concentrations of ammonium 7 mg n l had sufficient precursors for mcs production which might lead to higher imcs both high and low ammonium concentration resulted in high total extracellular mcs emcs level in water despite of their different mechanisms these results indicated that mitigation of nitrogen in eutrophic waters should be very cautious of unexpected risks as the reduction of ammonium may have the risk of stimulating m aeruginosa growth or increasing emcs levels

investigations 1998 2016 in taihu lake china where severe cyanobacterial blooms occur frequently the ph was maintained by adding n tris hydroxymethyl methyl 3 amino propanesulfonic acid cultures were gently agitated by hand three times daily and rearranged randomly to reduce disturbances caused by uneven light intensity in the incubator the 3 mg n l of every source of n was used as the control

initial 6 d after which cell densities were significantly lower than the control 3 mg n l anova p 0 05 cell density at the 3 mg n l of ammonium treatment was higher than those at the other ammonium treatments during 12 d incubation period fig 1b presenting a significantly higher specific growth rate μ in both the exponential and stationary phases table s3 in supporting information anova p 0 05 compared to the nitrate and urea treatments cell density of m aeruginosa cultured in the 7 mg n l ammonium was significantly lower since day 6 anova p 0 05 after 14 d of growth the maximum cell densities in the nitrate and urea treatments occurred at 7 mg n l and were 1 37 107 and 1 22 107 cells ml respectively the maximum cell density in ammonium treatment was also found at 7 mg n l but on day 16 reaching a peak of 5 75 106 cells ml which was almost half of that observed in nitrate treatment the photosynthetic activity of m aeruginosa under different n treatments was presented in fig 2

and ammonium treatments with the same n concentrations anova p 0 05 as shown in fig 3 n was quickly consumed by m aeruginosa in all 0 5 mg n l treatments with most n exhaustion after 12 d of incubation in the 3 and 7 mg n l treatments the concentration of nitrate declined slowly during the first 4 d of incubation and decreased sharply afterwards the final n utilization efficiency η in almost all treatments was nearly 100 except in the 7 mg n l ammonium treatment where it was 94 8 for all treatments the n uptake rate v significantly decreased from the exponential phase to stationary

exponential phase anova p 0 05 while they exhibited no significant differences in the stationary phase imcs were promoted by the increase in ammonium concentration from 0 5 to 7 mg n l peaking at 45

emcs concentrations were significantly higher under 0 5 mg n l than 3 and 7 mg n l treatments in both exponential and stationary phases anova p 0 05 additionally both imcs and emcs were negatively

among the amino acids methionine leucine lysine phenylalanine and tyrosine were more abundant than the others in most treatments especially ammonium fig 5 a the cells cultured in ammonium had higher contents of amino acids associated with mcs synthesis methionine leucine serine alanine arginine and glutamic acid than the cells cultured in nitrate and urea aspartic acid which also participates in mcs synthesis was more abundant under nitrate than the other n treatments in both exponential and stationary phases the quota of each amino acid showed a decreasing trend with the increase in n concentration in the nitrate and urea treatments however for ammonium treatment all amino acid quotas increased at first and then decreased except leucine following algal growth from the exponential to stationary phase all amino acid quotas declined in most treatments fig 5a furthermore imcs concentrations were positively correlated with the content of amino acids associated with mcs synthesis fig 5b r2 0 645 p 0 001 n 17 the variations in protein quota were similar to those in amino acid quota in all treatments fig 5c moreover the protein quota was significantly higher in the exponential phase than in the stationary phase anova p 0 05 in all treatments except for the 0 5 mg n l nitrate treatment protein quotas were negatively associated with specific growth rate and were positively correlated with n uptake rate fig s2 in supporting information p 0 05 n 54 3 4 differential transcripts of target genes among treatments the effects of nitrate on the expression of n metabolism

treatment than under 7 mg n l treatment anova p 0 05 in both the exponential and stationary phases compared with the control 3 0 mg n l the transcription of pipx glnb and mcyd in the exponential phase and glnb in the stationary phase were significantly up regulated under 0 5 mg n l nitrate treatment anova p 0 05 the expressions of ntca pipx and glnb were down regulated with the increase in ammonium and urea concentrations fig 6b and c compared to 0 5 mg n l the transcription of ntca was notably down regulated under 7 mg n l ammonium and urea treatments in both exponential and stationary phases anova p 0 05 higher transcripts of mcya and mcyd were detected in the 0 5 mg n l ammonium treatment however the transcripts of mcya and mcyd showed no significant differences under the different urea concentrations 4 discussion 4 1 effects of different nitrogen forms on m aeruginosa growth for cyanobacteria exogenous n entering the cells must be converted to ammonium for assimilation esteves ferreira et al 2018 thereby making ammonium the most energetically favorable source of n britto et al 2001 urea also has energetic advantages as a source of n because each urea molecule can be hydrolyzed into two ammonium molecules donald et al 2011 therefore m aeruginosa should grow better in ammonium and urea than in nitrate however our results showed that m aeruginosa growth was not closely related to the form of n but to its concentrations cells cultured in the different n sources at 0 5 mg n l experienced n deprivation due to the exhaustion of n in batch culture as indicated by the sharply declined cell density persistently decreased fv fm values and presence of chlorosis yellow and turbid cultures nevertheless previous studies conducted in continuous culture report that microcystis could grow well under n limiting conditions downing et al 2005 these findings suggested that when algal blooms occurred without sufficient exogenous nitrogen input an environmentally relevant n concentration of 0 5 mg n l could not sustain long term growth of m aeruginosa no matter which nitrogenous compound was used as the n source the increase in nitrate concentration exerted significant promotion effects on m aeruginosa growth fig 1 in the nitrate treatments the cells grew slowly in the initial 4 d during which time nitrate concentration slowly decreased while fv fm increased when the cells entered the exponential growth phase m aeruginosa reached maximum growth rate and fv fm ratio along with the rapid consumption of nitrate and presented significantly higher μ in 7 mg n l treatment than that in 0 5 mg n l treatment table s3 in supporting information anova p 0 05 compared to nitrate ammonium played a dual role in m aeruginosa growth cell density in the 3 mg n l ammonium treatment showed no significant differences from the 7 mg n l ammonium treatment during 0 14 d anova p 0 05 in the 7 mg n l ammonium treatment significantly lower cell densities and fv fm were observed than nitrate and urea treatments anova p 0 05 implying that m aeruginosa growth was strongly suppressed this could be attributed to the accumulation of ammonia in cells under high ammonium conditions compared to ammonium the undissociated and uncharged ammonia molecular is lipid soluble enabling it to easily diffuse across cell membrane the free internal ammonia exerts toxic effects on algal growth not only by inducing photodamage of photosystem ii collos and harrison 2014 but also by disturbing cytosolic ph because of the production of h as a byproduct of growth britto and kronzucker 2002 a previous field study of 33 chinese lakes confirmed that ammonium is detrimental to algae growth at higher concentrations wu et al 2006 however ammonium at low concentrations is more easily absorbed by algae than other biologically available forms of n berg 2003 thus although cell growth under ammonium treatments experienced a time lag the concentrations of ammonium dropped more rapidly than the concentrations of nitrate during initial cultivation due to the faster uptake of ammonium in the urea treatments of this study m aeruginosa growth was stimulated by the increase in n concentration presenting comparable cell densities to nitrate treatments fig 1 previous studies have revealed that m aeruginosa can develop well using urea as the sole n source and even obtain higher growth than using other organic or inorganic nitrogenous compounds berman and chava 1999 li et al 2016 however wu et al 2015 reported that cell growth was restricted by high urea concentration of 3 6 mmol n l and erratt et al 2018 also found that under 7 mmol n l urea treatment cell growth could be completely inhibited in a high urea environment excessive ammonium is produced by urea hydrolysis and excreted into the medium creating unfavorable conditions for the growth of m aeruginosa sakamoto et al 1998 thus the environmentally relevant urea concentrations 0 5 7 mg n l selected for this study were suitable for m aeruginosa growth as a reduced n form urea was rapidly and largely taken by m aeruginosa with a final efficiency η of nearly 100 the massive uptake of urea may not only enhance m aeruginosa growth but also participate in pigment synthesis as observed by erratt et al 2018 cells present higher concentrations of chlorophyll a and phycocyanin under urea treatment than under other n treatments 4 2 effects of different nitrogen forms on mcs production and release in this study the imcs showed different responses to the different forms of n sources in the nitrate treatments imcs levels were negatively associated with nitrate concentration fig 4a and were much lower in the 7 mg n l treatment about half than in the 0 5 mg n l treatment during the exponential phase this could be explained from three considerations i as hypothesized by zilliges et al 2011 under oxidative stress mcs were covalently bound to the proteins including several enzymes of the calvin cycle phycobiliproteins and two nadph dependent reductases and increased the stability and enhanced the activity of these proteins thus increasing the fitness of the toxic strains the cells cultured in 0 5 mg n l of nitrate were under oxidative stress as shown by the decrease in fv fm and presence of chlorosis which may trigger the synthesis of mcs to resist the stress ii in cyanobacteria the ntca pipx and pii proteins together with 2 og constitute a complex network that mediates c n balance by regulating the activity and expression of transporters and enzymes related to c n metabolism esteves ferreira et al 2018 as ginn et al 2010 and kuniyoshi et al 2011 showed ntca could bind to the promoter regions of mcya d as well as mcye and mcyh resulting in the up regulation of mcy genes transcription under nitrate limitations and the binding affinity was further enhanced by the increased 2 oxoglutarate 2 og level this suggested that mcs production responds to the c and n metabolism equilibrium our study also showed that the transcripts of genes associated with mcs biosynthesis mcya and mcyd and n metabolism ntca pipx and glnb varied in the same way in all nitrate treatments cells grown under 0 5 mg n l nitrate treatments were experiencing nutrient stress and the transcription of ntca pipx and glnb genes were up regulated higher transcripts of ntca likely increased their bindings to mcya d promoter regions to up regulate their transcription potentially resulting in more mcs synthesis iii the changes in mcs production in response to nitrate concentration were mediated by changes in the intracellular availability of amino acids especially amino acids associated with mcs synthesis cells grown under high nitrate concentration performed higher μ leading to the decrease in protein quotas as shown by the negative relationship between them fig s2 in supporting information and amino acids quotas the decline in the intracellular availability of amino acids especially the content of amino acids associated with mcs synthesis led to the decrease in imcs quotas as shown by the positive relationship between them r2 0 645 p 0 001 in the nitrate treatments the emc levels presented no significant differences among the three treatments in the stationary phase thus the increase in nitrate concentration did not affect the release of mcs under the same n concentration the cells demonstrated higher imcs levels under ammonium treatment than under nitrate treatment fig 4a this indicated that the effects of n on mcs production differed among n species and ammonium might be more bioavailable for mcs synthesis than nitrate previous research has similarly reported that the addition of ammonium resulted in higher mcs content than the addition of nitrate donald et al 2011 the imcs levels were enhanced by the increase in ammonium concentrations compared to 0 5 mg n l ammonium treatment imcs content were significantly higher fig 4 in 7 mg n l ammonium treatment the significantly higher level of mcs synthesis associated amino acids in cells grown in 7 mg n l ammonium treatment might provide sufficient precursors for mcs synthesis and lead to the higher imcs contents as shown by the correlations between imcs levels and the content of amino acids however measurements have to be conducted to directly prove if the amino acids are fully utilized for mc production furthermore imcs contents exhibited a positive relationship with n uptake rate fig s2 in supporting information results from continuous culture also suggest that imcs contents are positively modulated by n uptake rate downing et al 2005 the higher n uptake rate in 7 mg n l of ammonium treatment might be another clue to explain the higher imcs levels under high ammonium condition this may also shed light on the role of n species in imcs synthesis since the cells under ammonium treatments presented the highest n uptake rate and imcs levels than those in nitrate and urea treatments with the same n level the high imcs content in 7 mg n l ammonium treatment was not accompanied by the up regulation of transcriptions of mcya and mcyd genes in cyanobacteria mcyd mcyd mainly participates in the formation of 3 amino 9 methoxy 2 6 8 trimethyl 10 phenyl 4 6 decadienoic acid adda while mcya mcya incorporates serine and alanine into the growing peptide chain tillett et al 2000 our results showed that among the amino acid associated with mcs synthesis the contents of methionine and leuμμcine were significantly higher in 7 mg n l ammonium treatments than those in other treatments while the contents of other amino acid had little difference as the incorporation of methionine and leucine was performed by mcyb mcyb the higher imcs content may be possibly attributed to the increase in transcripts of mcyb gene which had to be further investigated although the imcs levels in 7 mg n l ammonium treatment were two times higher than that of 0 5 mg n l ammonium treatment the emcs levels showed no significant differences between the two treatments in the ammonium treatments compared to the control low 0 5 mg n l n concentration restricted the growth of m aeruginosa with a significantly lower μ which may be one explanation for the higher emcs due to their negative correlation fig s2 in supporting information meanwhile the decreased fv fm represented the occurrence of photodamage caused by n limitation which may lead to cell death and hence mcs releasing fallon and brock 1979 harke and gobler 2013 high 7 mg n l n concentration exerted ammonium toxicity associating with photodamage and disturbance of intracellular ph with the deterioration of growth conditions massive mcs were released following cell disruption drath et al 2008 it is therefore important for china to be cautious of her current nitrogen management as the country is taking great efforts to decrease the high level of ammonium in rivers and lakes yu et al 2019 the imcs levels and transcripts of mcya and mcyd showed no significant differences among the various urea concentrations although the protein and amino acids quotas as well as transcripts of ntca pipx and glnb decreased with the increase in n concentration a previous study covering a large urea concentration range 0 125 250 mg l also reported the same results with intracellular mc lr content demonstrating no significant differences among treatments huang et al 2014 therefore the utilization of urea for mcs synthesis in m aeruginosa is more intricate than the utilization of inorganic n as an organic form of n urea hydrolysis not only provides n but also inorganic c to the cells the additional n and c are not used for mcs synthesis but are redirected to other key physiological processes holding high n demands such as pigment synthesis erratt et al 2018 harke et al 2016b in the urea treatments emcs levels in 3 and 7 mg n l treatments were comparable while it was significantly higher in 0 5 mg n l treatments this result further demonstrated that 0 5 mg n l urea treatment did not favor m aeruginosa growth and led to mcs release 5 conclusions this study presented the physiological effects of the three commonly bioavailable n sources on the regulation of growth and mcs production of m aeruginosa cell growth was found to be promoted by the increase in nitrate ammonium and urea concentration but was suppressed by high concentrations of ammonium 7 mg n l cells grown under high concentrations of ammonium 7 mg n l had high levels of amino acids associated with mcs synthesis which may favor mcs synthesis both high and low ammonium concentration increased emcs levels but achieved through different underlying mechanisms this study improved our understanding of the regulating effects of n forms and concentrations on the growth and mc synthesis of m aeruginosa which is beneficial to screening plausible n management strategies to mitigate toxic algal blooms author

18607,the effects of three commonly bioavailable nitrogen n sources nitrate ammonium and urea on regulating the growth and microcystins mcs production of microcystis aeruginosa m aeruginosa at environmentally relevant concentrations were investigated from a physiological perspective changes in amino acid quotas as well as the transcripts of target genes associated with n metabolism ntca pipx and glnb and toxin formation mcya and mcyd were determined results indicated that increases in nitrate and urea concentrations enhanced m aeruginosa growth but high ammonium concentration 7 mg n l suppressed the growth the total intracellular mcs imcs content was well correlated 0 65 p 0 001 to amino acids the sum of methionine leucine serine alanine arginine glutamic acid and aspartic acid associated with mcs production ammonium favors amino acid synthesis in m aeruginosa thus cells grown under high concentrations of ammonium 7 mg n l had sufficient precursors for mcs production which might lead to higher imcs both high and low ammonium concentration resulted in high total extracellular mcs emcs level in water despite of their different mechanisms these results indicated that mitigation of nitrogen in eutrophic waters should be very cautious of unexpected risks as the reduction of ammonium may have the risk of stimulating m aeruginosa growth or increasing emcs levels

n and phosphorus p loads derived from intensive anthropogenic activities including domestic sewage agricultural fertilizer industrial discharge and fossil fuel combustion which facilitate the occurrence of harmful cyanobacterial blooms globally huisman et al 2018 yi et al 2017 traditionally p is considered the primary limiting nutrient in the proliferation and expansion of cyanobacterial blooms schindler 1974 based on the premise that n supplies can be met by n2 fixation harke et al 2016a for decades p reduction has been considered the most effective strategy for bloom management conley et al 2009 however increasing evidences have highlighted the importance of n in freshwater eutrophication smith and schindler 2009 yu et al 2019 given the expanding blooms of non n2 fixer microcystis in many eutrophic systems bridgeman et al 2013 guan et al 2018 the role of external n in the global proliferation of cyanobacterial blooms seems certainly underestimated several cyanobacterial species can produce neurotoxic and hepatotoxic compounds jeong et al 2017 penn et al 2014 microcystins mcs which are mainly produced by the microcystis anabaena nostoc oscillatoria and planktothrix genera nishizawa et al 2000 can have detrimental effects on aquatic organisms wildlife livestock and even induce human fatalities in case of chronic exposure azevedo et al 2002 song et al 2007 the mcs family currently includes at least 246 hepatotoxins containing cyclic heptapeptides meriluoto et al 2017 whose synthesis is directed by the microcystin synthetase mcy gene cluster composed of two putative operons mcyabc and mcydefghij tillett et al 2000 the generalized mcs structure consists of five constant amino acids alanine leucine arginine glutamic acid and aspartic acid and two variable l amino acids among the variants microcystin lr mc lr is the most common and toxic carmichael 1992 with leucine l and arginine r the two variable l amino acids as an essential macronutrient n not only plays an important role in cyanobacterial growth but also in a series of physiological processes including mcs production horst et al 2014 nitrate and ammonium are the most commonly available n sources in freshwater while urea content has been increasing due to its frequent application in agricultural fertilizer and aquaculture ahnen et al 2015 glibert et al 2006 microcystis exhibits different growth statuses and mcs levels following exposure to different forms and concentrations of n li et al 2016 wu et al 2015 ginn et al 2010 analyzed the regulation of mc synthesis by n in microcystis aeruginosa m aeruginosa pcc 7806 and discovered that ntca the global n regulator encoded by the ntca gene could bind to the bidirectional mcya d promoter region and function as an activator of mcy gene transcription in cyanobacteria n control is tightly mediated by ntca with the assistance of n regulator protein pii glnb gene product and its interaction protein pipx pipx gene product frias et al 1993 herrero et al 2001 ambient n is transported into cells and converted into ammonium through different pathways and then enter into the glutamine synthetase gs and glutamate synthase gogat pathway incorporating with 2 oxoglutarate 2 og for eventual assimilation muro pastor and florencio 2003 once the n is assimilated aminotransferases can transfer the amino group from glutamate to other carbon backbones to form additional amino acids when cells are in the condition of low n levels pipx dissociates from the phosphorylated pii protein and interacts with ntca 2 og affecting the expressing of n assimilation related gene when cells are in the condition of high n levels pipx is bound with the unphosphorylated pii instead of ntca leading to the inhibition of n uptake esteves ferreira et al 2018 llácer et al 2010 thus changes in ambient n will affect the transcription of ntca and other n metabolism associated genes and possibly the mcy gene cluster amino acids are vital precursor substances participating in mcs biosynthesis tillett et al 2000 previous studies have primarily concentrated on changes in microcystis growth and mcs production in response to externally added amino acids dai et al 2009 yan et al 2004 microcystis can uptake and utilize several amino acids for mcs synthesis though the addition of leucine and arginine both inhibit mcs production yan et al 2004 however little is known about changes in the composition and content of intracellular amino acids or the relationship between intracellular amino acid and mcs production when microcystis is under different n conditions in this study an axenic m aeruginosa strain was selected as a model organism changes in m aeruginosa growth status photosynthetic activity n utilization mcs production and amino acid quotas were monitored along with the transcription of target genes associated with n metabolism and toxin formation under different bioavailable nitrogenous compound supplies the main objective of this research was to discover the physiological effects of different n sources on regulating the growth and mcs production of m aeruginosa at environmentally relevant concentrations from both phenotypic and molecular aspects the results could be of value to provide a scientific basis for n management including the n species and levels in eutrophic waters 2

three times daily the sources of n used here were nitrate sodium nitrate ammonium ammonium chloride and urea pre cultures in the exponential phase were harvested by centrifugation 5000 rpm 15 min 4 c and rinsed twice with sodium bicarbonate solution 15 mg l the cells were re suspended in n free bg 11 medium for 3 d to exhaust intracellular n which was introduced by cells from the pre cultured n rich bg 11 medium this procedure has been commonly used in previous studies and no adverse effects were observed in the subsequent experiments dai et al 2009 liu et al 2019 during algal blooms in nature water bodies n is largely consumed and its concentration often decreases sharply thus we adopted batch cultures in this study they were performed in 2000 ml conical flasks containing 1000 ml modified bg 11 medium with an initial cell density of 5 105 cells ml three levels of each n species 0 5 3 and 7 mg n l were chosen and the ph was set to 8 2 0 2 according to our long term field investigations 1998 2016 in taihu lake china where severe cyanobacterial blooms occur frequently the ph was maintained by adding n tris hydroxymethyl methyl 3 amino propanesulfonic acid cultures were gently agitated by hand three times daily and rearranged randomly to reduce disturbances caused by uneven light intensity in the incubator the 3 mg n l of every source of n was used as the control standard all experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 2 analysis methods 2 2 1 cell density fv fm and n concentration cell density maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem ii fv fm and n

a phyto pam fluorometer walz germany which has been commonly used as a sensitive diagnostic of n limitation for microcystis simis et al 2012 harke and gobler 2013 before measurement cultures were kept in darkness for 10 min to allow all reaction centers to open fv fm was calculated as fv fm fm fo fm where fm and fo are the maximum and minimum fluorescence yields of the dark adapted cells

compared to the nitrate and urea treatments cell density of m aeruginosa cultured in the 7 mg n l ammonium was significantly lower since day 6 anova p 0 05 after 14 d of growth the maximum cell

day 16 reaching a peak of 5 75 106 cells ml which was almost half of that observed in nitrate treatment the photosynthetic activity of m aeruginosa under different n treatments was presented in fig 2

incubation in the 3 and 7 mg n l treatments the concentration of nitrate declined slowly during the first 4 d of incubation and decreased sharply afterwards the final n utilization efficiency η in almost all treatments was nearly 100 except in the 7 mg n l ammonium treatment where it was 94 8 for all treatments the n uptake rate v significantly decreased from the exponential phase to stationary

exponential phase anova p 0 05 while they exhibited no significant differences in the stationary phase imcs were promoted by the increase in ammonium concentration from 0 5 to 7 mg n l peaking at 45

emcs concentrations were significantly higher under 0 5 mg n l than 3 and 7 mg n l treatments in both exponential and stationary phases anova p 0 05 additionally both imcs and emcs were negatively

among the amino acids methionine leucine lysine phenylalanine and tyrosine were more abundant than the others in most treatments especially ammonium fig 5 a the cells cultured in ammonium had higher contents of amino acids associated with mcs synthesis methionine leucine serine alanine arginine and glutamic acid than the cells cultured in nitrate and urea aspartic acid which also participates in mcs synthesis was more abundant under nitrate than the other n treatments in both exponential and stationary phases the quota of each amino acid showed a decreasing trend with the increase in n concentration in the nitrate and urea treatments however for ammonium treatment all amino acid quotas increased at first and then decreased except leucine following algal growth from the exponential to stationary phase all amino acid quotas declined in most treatments fig 5a furthermore imcs concentrations were positively correlated with the content of amino acids associated with mcs synthesis fig 5b r2 0 645 p 0 001 n 17 the variations in protein quota were similar to those in amino acid quota in all treatments fig 5c moreover the protein quota was significantly higher in the exponential

treatment than under 7 mg n l treatment anova p 0 05 in both the exponential and stationary phases compared with the control 3 0 mg n l the transcription of pipx glnb and mcyd in the exponential phase and glnb in the stationary phase were significantly up regulated under 0 5 mg n l nitrate treatment anova p 0 05 the expressions of ntca pipx and glnb were down regulated with the increase in ammonium and urea concentrations fig 6b and c compared to 0 5 mg n l the transcription of ntca was notably down regulated under 7 mg n l ammonium and urea treatments in both exponential and stationary phases anova p 0 05 higher transcripts of mcya and mcyd were detected in the 0 5 mg n l ammonium treatment however the transcripts of mcya and mcyd showed no significant differences under the different urea concentrations 4 discussion 4 1 effects of different nitrogen forms on m aeruginosa growth for cyanobacteria exogenous n entering the cells must be converted to ammonium for assimilation esteves ferreira et al 2018 thereby making ammonium the most energetically favorable source of n britto et al 2001 urea also has energetic advantages as a source of n because each urea molecule can be hydrolyzed into two ammonium molecules donald et al 2011 therefore m aeruginosa should grow better in ammonium and urea than in nitrate however our results showed that m aeruginosa growth was not closely related to the form of n but to its concentrations cells cultured in the different n sources at 0 5 mg n l experienced n deprivation due to the exhaustion of n in batch culture as indicated by the sharply declined cell density persistently decreased fv fm values and presence of chlorosis yellow and turbid cultures nevertheless previous studies conducted in continuous culture report that microcystis could grow well under n limiting conditions downing et al 2005 these findings suggested that when algal blooms occurred without sufficient exogenous nitrogen input an environmentally relevant n concentration of 0 5 mg n l could not sustain long term growth of m aeruginosa no matter which nitrogenous compound was used as the n source the increase in nitrate concentration exerted significant promotion effects on m aeruginosa growth fig 1 in the nitrate treatments the cells grew slowly in the initial 4 d during which time nitrate concentration slowly decreased while fv fm increased when the cells entered the exponential growth phase m aeruginosa reached maximum growth rate and fv fm ratio along with the rapid consumption of nitrate and presented significantly higher μ in 7 mg n l treatment than that in 0 5 mg n l treatment table s3 in supporting information anova p 0 05 compared to nitrate ammonium played a dual role in m aeruginosa growth cell density in the 3 mg n l ammonium treatment showed no significant differences from the 7 mg n l ammonium treatment during 0 14 d anova p 0 05 in the 7 mg n l ammonium treatment significantly lower cell densities and fv fm were observed than nitrate and urea treatments anova p 0 05 implying that m aeruginosa growth was strongly suppressed this could be attributed to the accumulation of ammonia in cells under high ammonium conditions compared to ammonium the undissociated and uncharged ammonia molecular is lipid soluble enabling it to easily diffuse across cell membrane the free internal ammonia exerts toxic effects on algal growth not only by inducing photodamage of photosystem ii collos and harrison 2014 but also by disturbing cytosolic ph because of the production of h as a byproduct of growth britto and kronzucker 2002 a previous field study of 33 chinese lakes confirmed that ammonium is detrimental to algae growth at higher concentrations wu et al 2006 however ammonium at low concentrations is more easily absorbed by algae than other biologically available forms of n berg 2003 thus although cell growth under ammonium treatments experienced a time lag the concentrations of ammonium dropped more rapidly than the concentrations of nitrate during initial cultivation due to the faster uptake of ammonium in the urea treatments of this study m aeruginosa growth was stimulated by the increase in n concentration presenting comparable cell densities to nitrate treatments fig 1 previous studies have revealed that m aeruginosa can develop well using urea as the sole n source and even obtain higher growth than using other organic or inorganic nitrogenous compounds berman and chava 1999 li et al 2016 however wu et al 2015 reported that cell growth was restricted by high urea concentration of 3 6 mmol n l and erratt et al 2018 also found that under 7 mmol n l urea treatment cell growth could be completely inhibited in a high urea environment excessive ammonium is produced by urea hydrolysis and excreted into the medium creating unfavorable conditions for the growth of m aeruginosa sakamoto et al 1998 thus the environmentally relevant urea concentrations 0 5 7 mg n l selected for this study were suitable for m aeruginosa growth as a reduced n form urea was rapidly and largely taken by m aeruginosa with a final efficiency η of nearly 100 the massive uptake of urea may not only enhance m aeruginosa growth but also participate in pigment synthesis as observed by erratt et al 2018 cells present higher concentrations of chlorophyll a and phycocyanin under urea treatment than under other n treatments 4 2 effects of different nitrogen forms on mcs production and release in this study the imcs showed different responses to the different forms of n sources in the nitrate treatments imcs levels were negatively associated with nitrate concentration fig 4a and were much lower in the 7 mg n l treatment about half than in the 0 5 mg n l treatment during the exponential phase this could be explained from three considerations i as hypothesized by zilliges et al 2011 under oxidative stress mcs were covalently bound to the proteins including several enzymes of the calvin cycle phycobiliproteins and two nadph dependent reductases and increased the stability and enhanced the activity of these proteins thus increasing the fitness of the toxic strains the cells cultured in 0 5 mg n l of nitrate were under oxidative stress as shown by the decrease in fv fm and presence of chlorosis which may trigger the synthesis of mcs to resist the stress ii in cyanobacteria the ntca pipx and pii proteins together with 2 og constitute a complex network that mediates c n balance by regulating the activity and expression of transporters and enzymes related to c n metabolism esteves ferreira et al 2018 as ginn et al 2010 and kuniyoshi et al 2011 showed ntca could bind to the promoter regions of mcya d as well as mcye and mcyh resulting in the up regulation of mcy genes transcription under nitrate limitations and the binding affinity was further enhanced by the increased 2 oxoglutarate 2 og level this suggested that mcs production responds to the c and n metabolism equilibrium our study also showed that the transcripts of genes associated with mcs biosynthesis mcya and mcyd and n metabolism ntca pipx and glnb varied in the same way in all nitrate treatments cells grown under 0 5 mg n l nitrate treatments were experiencing nutrient stress and the transcription of ntca pipx and glnb genes were up regulated higher transcripts of ntca likely increased their bindings to mcya d promoter regions to up regulate their transcription potentially resulting in more mcs synthesis iii the changes in mcs production in response to nitrate concentration were mediated by changes in the intracellular availability of amino acids especially amino acids associated with mcs synthesis cells grown under high nitrate concentration performed higher μ leading to the decrease in protein quotas as shown by the negative relationship between them fig s2 in supporting information and amino acids quotas the decline in the intracellular availability of amino acids especially the content of amino acids associated with mcs synthesis led to the decrease in imcs quotas as shown by the positive relationship between them r2 0 645 p 0 001 in the nitrate treatments the emc levels presented no significant differences among the three treatments in the stationary phase thus the increase in nitrate concentration did not affect the release of mcs under the same n concentration the cells demonstrated higher imcs levels under ammonium treatment than under nitrate treatment fig 4a this indicated that the effects of n on mcs production differed among n species and ammonium might be more bioavailable for mcs synthesis than nitrate previous research has similarly reported that the addition of ammonium resulted in higher mcs content than the addition of nitrate donald et al 2011 the imcs levels were enhanced by the increase in ammonium concentrations compared to 0 5 mg n l ammonium treatment imcs content were significantly higher fig 4 in 7 mg n l ammonium treatment the significantly higher level of mcs synthesis associated amino acids in cells grown in 7 mg n l ammonium treatment might provide sufficient precursors for mcs synthesis and lead to the higher imcs contents as shown by the correlations between imcs levels and the content of amino acids however measurements have to be conducted to directly prove if the amino acids are fully utilized for mc production furthermore imcs contents exhibited a positive relationship with n uptake rate fig s2 in supporting information results from continuous culture also suggest that imcs contents are positively modulated by n uptake rate downing et al 2005 the higher n uptake rate in 7 mg n l of ammonium treatment might be another clue to explain the higher imcs levels under high ammonium condition this may also shed light on the role of n species in imcs synthesis since the cells under ammonium treatments presented the highest n uptake rate and imcs levels than those in nitrate and urea treatments with the same n level the high imcs content in 7 mg n l ammonium treatment was not accompanied by the up regulation of transcriptions of mcya and mcyd genes in cyanobacteria mcyd mcyd mainly participates in the formation of 3 amino 9 methoxy 2 6 8 trimethyl 10 phenyl 4 6 decadienoic acid adda while mcya mcya incorporates serine and alanine into the growing peptide chain tillett et al 2000 our results showed that among the amino acid associated with mcs synthesis the contents of methionine and leuμμcine were significantly higher in 7 mg n l ammonium treatments than those in other treatments while the contents of other amino acid had little difference as the incorporation of methionine and leucine was performed by mcyb mcyb the higher imcs content may be possibly attributed to the increase in transcripts of mcyb gene which had to be further investigated although the imcs levels in 7 mg n l ammonium treatment were two times higher than that of 0 5 mg n l ammonium treatment the emcs levels showed no significant differences between the two treatments in the ammonium treatments compared to the control low 0 5 mg n l n concentration restricted the growth of m aeruginosa with a significantly lower μ which may be one explanation for the higher emcs due to their negative correlation fig s2 in supporting information meanwhile the decreased fv fm represented the occurrence of photodamage caused by n limitation which may lead to cell death and hence mcs releasing fallon and brock 1979 harke and gobler 2013 high 7 mg n l n concentration exerted ammonium toxicity associating with photodamage and disturbance of intracellular ph with the deterioration of growth conditions massive mcs were released following cell disruption drath et al 2008 it is therefore important for china to be cautious of her current nitrogen management as the country is taking great efforts to decrease the high level of ammonium in rivers and lakes yu et al 2019 the imcs levels and transcripts of mcya and mcyd showed no significant differences among the various urea concentrations although the protein and amino acids quotas as well as transcripts of ntca pipx and glnb decreased with the increase in n concentration a previous study covering a large urea concentration range 0 125 250 mg l also reported the same results with intracellular mc lr content demonstrating no significant differences among treatments huang et al 2014 therefore the utilization of urea for mcs synthesis in m aeruginosa is more intricate than the utilization of inorganic n as an organic form of n urea hydrolysis not only provides n but also inorganic c to the cells the additional n and c are not used for mcs synthesis but are redirected to other key physiological processes holding high n demands such as pigment synthesis erratt et al 2018 harke et al 2016b in the urea treatments emcs levels in 3 and 7 mg n l treatments were comparable while it was significantly higher in 0 5 mg n l treatments this result further demonstrated that 0 5 mg n l urea treatment did not favor m aeruginosa growth and led to mcs release 5 conclusions this study presented the physiological effects of the three commonly bioavailable n sources on the regulation of growth and mcs production of m aeruginosa cell growth was found to be promoted by the increase in nitrate ammonium and urea concentration but was suppressed by high concentrations of ammonium 7 mg n l cells grown under high concentrations of ammonium 7 mg n l had high levels of amino acids associated with mcs synthesis which may favor mcs synthesis both high and low ammonium concentration increased emcs levels but achieved through different underlying mechanisms this study improved our understanding of the regulating effects of n forms and concentrations on the growth and mc synthesis of m aeruginosa which is beneficial to screening plausible n management strategies to mitigate toxic algal blooms author

18608,evaluating the causes and consequences of dominance by a limited number of taxa in phytoplankton communities is of huge importance in the current context of increasing anthropogenic pressures on natural ecosystems this is of particular concern in densely populated urban areas where usages and impacts of human populations on water ecosystems are strongly interconnected microbial biodiversity is commonly used as a bioindicator of environmental quality and ecosystem functioning but there are few studies at the regional scale that integrate the drivers of dominance in phytoplankton communities and their consequences on the structure and functioning of these communities here we studied the causes and consequences of phytoplankton dominance in 50 environmentally contrasted waterbodies sampled over four summer campaigns in the highly populated île de france region idf phytoplankton dominance was observed in 32 52 of the communities and most cases were attributed to chlorophyta 35 5 40 6 of cases and cyanobacteria 30 3 36 5 the best predictors of dominance were identified using multinomial logistic regression and included waterbody features surface depth and connection to the hydrological network and water column characteristics total n tn tp ratio water temperature and stratification the consequences of dominance were dependent on the identity of the dominant organisms and included modifications of biological attributes richness cohesion and functioning biomass rue of phytoplankton communities we constructed co occurrence networks using high resolution phytoplankton biomass and demonstrated that networks under dominance by chlorophyta and cyanobacteria exhibited significantly different structure compared with networks without dominance furthermore dominance by cyanobacteria was associated with more profound network modifications e g cohesion size density efficiency and proportion of negative links suggesting a stronger disruption of the structure and functioning of phytoplankton communities in the conditions in which this group dominates finally we provide a synthesis on the relationships between environmental drivers dominance

introduction continental aquatic ecosystems are considered among the most vulnerable to the combined pressure of anthropogenic activities and climate change adrian et al 2009 in the recent decades these pressures have led to an increase in the frequency and intensity of phytoplankton blooms in lakes all around the world aguilera et al 2017b almanza et al 2018 beaver et al 2018 dokulil and teubner 2000 moura et al 2018 ndlela et al 2016 paerl and huisman 2008 paerl and otten 2016 phytoplankton blooms correspond to rapid increases of primary producer s biomass often associated with the dominance of only a handful of taxa even if blooms are naturally occurring phenomena repeated dominance events have been associated with reduced number of species in eukaryotic and prokaryotic communities in lake ecosystems bagatini et al 2014 louati et al 2015 toporowska and pawlik skowrońska 2014 yang et al 2017b in addition the decomposition of phytoplankton blooms has been shown to generate greenhouse gases co2 ch4 n2o and release dissolved nutrients that can retroactively favor climate change and eutrophication li et al 2017 further biomass accumulation into a single group of primary producers can modify the resource use efficiency of phytoplankton and the transfer of biomass to zooplankton communities filstrup et al 2014 tian et al 2017 ultimately this may generate ecosystem wide modifications of food web dynamics leading to trophic collapse filstrup et al 2014 ullah et al 2018 impacting on the long term the numerous services that lakes provide to human populations vaughn 2010 this is of particular concern in densely populated urban areas where usages and impacts of human populations on lakes ecosystems are strongly interconnected surprisingly studies at the regional scale on the drivers of dominance in phytoplankton communities are still relatively scarce almanza et al 2018 or were mostly focused on cyanobacteria beaver et al 2018 marion et al 2017 o farrell et al 2019 and sometimes on only one or two species bonilla et al 2012 marmen et al 2016 moreover there is no comparison of the consequence of dominance by various organisms on the structure and functioning of phytoplankton communities there is increasing evidences that the capacity of microbial systems to support ecological functions and resist environmental forcing are emerging properties arising from the interactions between many taxa dai et al 2019 faust and raes 2012 goldford et al 2018 peura et al 2015 shi et al 2016 network based approaches provide an integrated representation of such inter taxa associations in microbial communities barberán et al 2012 deng et al 2012 and were thus recently proposed as potential indicators of environmental quality karimi et al 2017 similarly other approaches have been developed to estimate the amount of cohesion experienced by microbial communities with the underlying idea that this constitutes a fundamental yet neglected facet of the biodiversity of microbial communities dai et al 2019 danczak et al 2018 herren and mcmahon 2018 2017 most studies on planktonic networks in lakes focused on bacterial communities or were based on sequencing data van goethem et al 2017 woodhouse et al 2016 yang et al 2017a zhao et al 2016 additionally there are few studies related to the impact of dominance on the structure of phytoplankton networks carey et al 2017 moe et al 2016 despite the fact that recent studies have shown the under appreciated role of evenness the inverse of dominance in shaping microbial co occurrence networks faust et al 2015 liu et al 2019a b xue et al 2018 in addition the ability of network approaches to provide meaningful ecological information and to reflect the impact of dominance on communities is still a matter of debate röttjers and faust 2018 in this study we wanted to address two main objectives in a first time to identify the factors driving the dominance by a limited number of taxa in phytoplankton communities from periurban waterbodies located in a highly populated region and representing contrasted environmental conditions e g size depth watershed characteristics anthropogenic pressure in a second time to determine the consequences of dominance on the structure and functioning of phytoplankton communities and more particularly on the characteristics of co occurrence networks to do so we analyzed phytoplankton communities across four summer campaigns in 50 waterbodies located in the idf region and estimated the absolute biomass of taxa composing them then we combined variables at various spatial scales water column waterbody catchment to identify the drivers of dominance and analyzed its consequences on the biological and ecological characteristics of these communities our approach is based on the hypothesis that dominance should be triggered by a combination of drivers directly related to the intensity of human pressures on these ecosystems with consequences on the structure and functioning of phytoplankton communities depending on the dominant phytoplankton group 2 material and methods 2 1 study area sampling and in situ data acquisition a stratified sampling strategy was used to select 50 waterbodies figure a1 representative of the contrasted environmental conditions observed in the 248

eutrophic and 44 hypereutrophic catherine et al 2010 sampling was conducted over two weeks in summers 2006 2011 2012 and 2013 where we sampled 50 48 49 and 49 waterbodies respectively providing a total of 196 phytoplankton samples to integrate spatial heterogeneity each waterbody was sampled in three stations and each station was sampled at three depths using a 5l niskin water sampler the nine samples per waterbody were pooled for microscopy analyses ammonium nh4 orthophosphate po4 3 total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp analyses were carried out using colorimetric methods previously

temperature depth and ph were measured using a multiparameter sea bird sbe 19 seacat profiler sea bird electronics inc wa the values for each of the three sampling stations were averaged to obtain a

ts100 following the utermöhl method cen european committee for standardization 2006 a minimum of 500 units single cells colonies and filaments were counted in each sample to estimate the biovolume each identified taxon was associated to a geometric shape hillebrand 1999 sun and liu 2003 for each waterbody campaign combination we measured the dimensions on 30 individuals from each taxon representing more than 5 of the total abundance and reported it in a database that was used to infer the biovolume of those taxa when they represented less than 5 of the total abundance the biovolume of rare taxa was taken from the helcom phytoplankton check list olenina et al 2006 phytoplankton carbon biomass was estimated from biovolumes assuming a density of 1 g cm 3 as suggested elsewhere filstrup et al 2014 holmes et al 1969 we estimated three proxies of phytoplankton communities functioning total community biomass was estimated as the summed phytoplankton carbon biomass in the community filstrup et al 2014 resource use efficiency rue was estimated as community biomass divided by the amount of available resources both for tp and tn ptacnik et al 2008 although the sampling strategy and the counting procedure were shown to provide accurate estimates of local taxa richness maloufi et al 2016 direct estimation of taxa richness might be biased by low detection limit of rare taxa in communities under a strong gradient of dominance to safeguard against such a bias community taxa richness was estimated from individuals counts using abundance based chao extrapolation method

herren and mcmahon 2018 2017 to describe the potential of individual taxon for inter taxa associations i e connectedness but also the overall degree of connectivity within communities i e cohesion first we estimated the pairwise correlation matrices between taxa across all communities separately for positive and negative correlations then we used a null model to account for bias in these correlations due to the skewed distribution of taxa biomass herren and mcmahon 2017 we followed the authors recommendations to select appropriated type of null model and after considering taxa distribution across and within communities we choose to maintain taxa average biomass while randomizing the data then expected correlations generated by the null model were subtracted from the original correlation matrices to obtain corrected correlations matrices for each taxon the average positive and negative corrected correlation corresponded to their positive and negative connectedness values respectively connectedness was estimated for the 227 taxa out of the 506 detected that appeared in at least four out of the 196 sampled communities for each community cohesion was calculated as the summed connectedness of taxa composing the community weighted by their respective biomass because positive and negative connectedness are calculated separately there are two metrics of cohesion a positive and a negative one differences in connectedness between eight phytoplankton phyla i e bacillariophyta chlorophyta cryptophyta cyanobacteria dinophyta euglenophyta chrysophyta and xantophyta were tested using kruskal wallis rank sum test and dunn test r package dunn test dinno 2017 2 4 definition and estimation of dominance the first step to identify the drivers and consequences of dominance in phytoplankton communities was to identify groups of communities under various dominance scenarii in other terms we needed to identify i whether communities were under dominance by a reduced set of taxa or not and ii what was the identity of the dominant taxon in a first time for each community we calculated a dominance index that corresponded to 1 minus the pielou evenness index estimated using biomass matrices evenness h log s with h shannon weiner diversity and s taxa richness this dominance index ranged from 0 when the biomass distribution across taxa was perfectly even to 1 when community biomass corresponded to a single taxon then this index was used to separate communities not under dominance i e with index threshold from those under dominance index threshold in a second time communities considered under dominance in step 1 were grouped according to the identity of the dominant phyla that is the phyla whose relative biomass was above a selected threshold in order to avoid biases related to the selection of a unique threshold for each of these steps we used a range of values for the dominance 0 45 0 5 0 55 and relative biomass 0 45 0 5 0 55 thresholds which generated nine thresholds combinations that were used to separate communities into various dominance groups i e not dominated and dominated by different phyla table a1 data were analyzed in a similar way for each of the nine thresholds combinations and the results were summarized across all combinations to identify the global trends in our data 2 5 identification of the drivers of dominance in phytoplankton communities to identify the environmental drivers of dominance in the idf region we used classification models and variables at the water column waterbody and catchment scales to p the dominance group in which communities belong to the set of predictor variables was defined on the basis of their assumed contribution to the environmental conditions experienced within the waterbodies and modified from table a2 catherine et al 2010 at the water column scale nutrient concentration total n and p were used to reflect the quantity of available resources while water temperature and thermal stratification were used to reflect physical conditions of the water column at the waterbody scale several predictors related to their characteristics were included mean depth and waterbody surface were used as variables reflecting the capacity of the lake to dilute nutrient loadings waterbodies position within the landscape was reflected by their altitude their connection to the hydrological network i e the network of channels connecting small rivers and waterbodies throughout the idf region or their location in a regularly flooded area at the catchment scale the ratio between catchment and waterbody size was used to reflect the loading potential of a catchment system relative to the waterbody buffering capacity almanza et al 2018 the density of drainage connections within catchments was considered as it affects the catchment s ability to transport nutrients land use variables such as the proportion of catchment surface classified as forest agricultural and urban suburban or industrial referred as impervious cover were included as they constitute variables known to affect both the quantity and nature of loading variables at the catchment scale were estimated using the carthage 3 0 hydrological database and the mos databases www iau idf fr two classification approaches were compared random forest rf using the randomforest function from the r package randomforest v 3 4 4 with n 1000 trees liaw and wiener 2002 which has been shown to accurately predict the eutrophication level of waterbodies in the region catherine et al 2010 and multinomial logistic regression mlr using the multinom function from the r package nnet v 3 4 0 venables and ripley 2002 three models were tested table a3 model 1 was the more complex and aimed at predicting the classification of communities into six groups that corresponded to the absence of dominance or the dominance by bacillariophyta chlorophyta cyanobacteria dinophyta or other phyla model 2 focused on predicting the dichotomy between dominated versus not dominated communities model 3 focused on communities under dominance and aimed at predicting the identity of the dominating taxon for each model the rf and mlr methods were compared based on the proportion of communities accurately classified in their respective group i e confusion matrices the predictor variables that contributed to the classification success were subsequently identified using likelihood ratio chi square test o farrell et al 2019 venables and ripley 2002 2 6 determination of the consequences of dominance on community level properties to determine the consequence of dominance at the community level we compared the communities under various dominance scenarii in terms of community biomass estimated taxa richness rue separately for n and p based rue and cohesion positive and negative as widely different numbers of communities composed the different dominance groups global and pairwise differences between groups were tested using non parametric kruskal wallis rank sum test and dunn test respectively r package dunn test dinno 2017 community biomass and rue were log transformed before analyses 2 7 construction and characterization of co occurrence networks co occurrence networks were used to summarize the impact of dominance by a limited number of species on the structure of phytoplankton communities deng et al 2012 albeit promising network approaches are not devoid of limitations röttjers and faust 2018 first a large number of replicates are required to create a single network as its construction relies on co variations in the biomass of taxa across communities hence only the three groups with the largest number of communities were analyzed using this approach no dominance 17 n 56 depending on the selected thresholds dominance by chlorophyta 22 n 39 and dominance by cyanobacteria 22 n n 31 second microbial data are compositional by nature faust and raes 2012 and are thus prone to spurious correlations jackson 1997 lovell et al 2011 to limit these compositional biases we used absolute taxa biomass to estimate taxa association third microbial matrices contain a large proportion of zeros a phenomenon referred as the data sparsity problem paulson et al 2013 hence organisms absent from too many samples are often excluded from the analysis in search for a trade off between the amount of available data and their reliability here networks from each group were constructed using taxa detected in more than 12 5 of communities which corresponded to a compromise between the need to keep taxa with a maximum number of observations to accurately estimate their co occurrence and the need to keep enough taxa in the analysis to construct networks that are representative of the communities observed in the field we also tried with 7 5 10 12 5 15 20 and 25 röttjers and faust 2018 another issue lies in the choice of the metric used to estimate taxa association which should be made to reduce as much as possible the number of false positives karimi et al 2017 here we used the pearson correlation which is the standard in microbial networks studies and has been successfully used in association with random matrix theory in soils deng et al 2012 wang et al 2015 rhizosphere shi et al 2016 and lakes yang et al 2017b zhao et al 2016 this index assumes linear relationships between taxa biomass and is sensitive to data sparsity and compositional issues kurtz et al 2015 however we are confident that we considered all the ways to reduce the impact of methodological biases on our correlation based analyses then random matrix theory rmt was used to objectively identify a cutoff determining which associations were kept in the final network luo et al 2006 networks were generated using the molecular ecological network analyses mena pipeline deng et al 2012 and represented using cytoscape 3 6 0 shannon et al 2003 networks are composed of nodes which correspond to individual taxon connected by links or edges that represent significant associations between nodes networks structure was characterized using indexes derived from the graph theory pavlopoulos et al 2011 and recently suggested as potential bioindicators of the state of a system karimi et al 2017 at the node level we estimated two centrality indexes describing the importance of nodes in the network node degree was defined as the number of links to this node while node betweenness was defined as the number of geodesics i e shortest path between two nodes passing through the node betweenness reflects how central and influent a node may be in the network by being on the paths relating other nodes in the network we also tested whether the biomass of a taxon was related to its centrality in the network using correlation tests cor test function in r nodes clustering coefficient was used to describe how well a node was connected with its neighbors at the network level we estimated the proportion of positive and negative links along with global network properties deng et al 2012 average geodesic distance corresponds to the average length of the shortest path between every pairs of nodes in the network geodesic efficiency reflects the size of the network while network density reflects its complexity and corresponded to the ratio between realized and potential links 3 results 3 1 characteristics of phytoplankton communities in the waterbodies of the idf region a total of 506 phytoplankton taxa corresponding to 181 genera were identified across the 196 samples four campaigns with 48 50 waterbodies 72 5 were classified at the species level and the remaining 27 5 at the genus level the generic term taxa will be used in the text to refer to the diversity unit used in this study community richness ranged from four to 213 taxa per community with an average of 42 6 27 8 the proportion of communities identified as dominated by a reduced number of taxa during summer in the idf region ranged from 31 6 to 51 5 depending on thresholds combinations used to define groups table a1 the proportion of communities not under dominance was more variable and ranged from nine to 29 two phylum the chlorophyta and the cyanobacteria represented most of the cases of dominance with 35 5 40 6 and 30 3 36 5 of dominance cases respectively the most dominant chlorophytes taxa included coelastrum polychordum botryococcus sp pediastrum boryanum pediastrum simplex pediastrum duplex and pandorina sp the most dominant cyanobacteria taxa included aphanizomenon flos aquae dolichospermum sp aphanizomenon klebahnii planktothrix agardhii dolichospermum flos aquae and microcystis aeruginosa the other phyla dominated in a smaller number of cases dinophyta 9 4 11 0 bacillariophyta 7 3 9 0 and the remaining other groups 8 8 12 5 3 2 association potential of phytoplankton organisms the inter taxa association potential i e connectedness was estimated for the 227 most occurring taxa and significant differences were observed across phyla the effect of phylum was stronger for positive than for negative connectedness kruskal wallis test p value 0 001 and 0 039 respectively supplementary figure a2 and table a4 pairwise tests revealed that cryptophyta and dinophyta exhibited significantly stronger negative connectedness than other phyla dunn test p value 0 05 table a3 however these two groups exhibited highly variable negative connectedness and were represented by a limited number of taxa n 4 and 5 respectively in terms of positive connectedness cyanobacteria differed significantly from five out of the seven other phyla dunn test p value 0 05 table a5 with the exception of xantophyta and bacillariophyta this later phyla was significantly different than chlorophyta these results position cyanobacteria apart from the other phytoplankton phyla with lower positive inter taxa association 3 3 environmental drivers of dominance in phytoplankton communities classification approaches were used to identify the environmental factors that determined the dominance status in phytoplankton communities cf table a3 for a description of data for each of the three tested models multinomial logistic regression mlr was more accurate than random forest rf to determine the dominance status of phytoplankton communities using the selected predictor variables table 1 indeed mlr accurately classified communities in 63 69 and 80 of the cases while rf accurately classified communities in 43 67 and 57 of the cases for models 1 2 and 3 respectively this was mostly due to the low accuracy of rf in categories with low sample sizes i e bacillariophyta dinophyta and others categories interestingly both models that included a no dominance category 1 and 2 exhibited a low classification accuracy for this category the predictors that contributed in the accuracy of mlr models included variables at various scales from the water column physical and chemical features to the catchment characteristics table 2 overall the variables with the highest number of significant contributions were the total n concentration followed by the water temperature the tn tp ratio and the connection of the waterbody to the hydrological network while water thermal stratification depth and waterbody surface contributed less frequently regarding the quantitative contribution to classification accuracy i e χ2 values the connection of the waterbody to the hydrological network the water temperature and tn tp ratio were the prominent variables variables representing the state of the water column and the characteristics of the waterbody were mostly influencing classification accuracy in models that included the identity of the dominant taxon models 1 and 3 in model 2 only tn tp ratio was significant across the nine tested dominance thresholds 3 4 structure and functioning of phytoplankton communities under various dominance scenarii we compared several community level properties across dominance scenarii to determine whether dominance and the identity of the dominant group were associated with differences in the structure and functioning of phytoplankton communities fig 1 all the tested variables significantly differed across groups kruskal wallis test p value 0 05 table 3 but a more detailed picture was provided by pairwise comparison table a6 in terms of total community biomass we observed a clear dichotomy with the communities dominated by bacillariophyta chlorophyta or cyanobacteria reaching a significantly higher biomass than communities from the others groups regarding community richness the effect of dominance appeared more contrasted and dependent on the identity of the dominant phylum fig 1 on one hand chlorophyta dominated communities exhibited a higher richness compared to all the groups with the exception of bacillariophyta on the other hand communities dominated by cyanobacteria and others organisms exhibited lower richness than the no dominance and the bacillariophyta groups in terms of rue two groups clearly stood out chlorophyta and cyanobacteria which were the only ones to differ significantly from the others and no dominance groups this was particularly striking for the use of nitrogen resources i e ruen in terms of community cohesion the cyanobacteria dominated communities were apart from the others exhibiting significantly lower negative and positive cohesion fig 1 to conclude the consequence of dominance on community structure and functioning appeared taxa specific and dependent on the considered community level property overall dominance by cyanobacteria showed the strongest effect on all the studied variables and tend to separate these communities from others notably in terms of cohesion dominance by chlorophyta also has strong effects on community functioning while bacillariophyta dominance seemed to have a lower albeit significant effect 3 5 characteristics of phytoplankton co occurrence networks in various dominance scenarii we constructed co occurrence networks to summarize the structure of phytoplankton communities in various scenarii of dominance by a limited number of taxa fig 2 and figure a3 this was done for the nine tested combinations of dominance index and relative biomass thresholds and for the three groups for which we had the most replicates dominance by chlorophyta or cyanobacteria and absence of dominance the pairwise similarity cutoffs estimated using rmt were similar among the three groups and across the nine thresholds combinations with average values of 0 33 0 02 0 32 0 01 and 0 32 0 03 for chlorophyta cyanobacteria and no dominance respectively comparison of observed networks topological properties with those of randomized networks indicated that networks structures were non random and unlikely due to chance the observed networks exhibited a ratio of clustering coefficient to geodesic distance higher than 1 which is thought to be characteristic of small world networks humphries and gurney 2008 this ratio was the highest in the no dominance networks 2 1 0 9 then decreased under dominance with intermediate and low values for the chlorophyta 1 5 0 3 and cyanobacteria dominated 1 2 0 1 networks the observed numbers of nodes and links decreased from the chlorophyta dominated networks the no dominance and the cyanobacteria dominated networks table 4 network density was the highest in the cyanobacteria dominated networks while the chlorophyta and no dominance networks exhibited lower and more similar density two indexes reflecting the size of the networks geodesic efficiency and average geodesic distance respectively increased and decreased from no dominance chlorophyta and cyanobacteria dominated networks the highest proportion of negative links was observed in the cyanobacteria dominated networks with on average 48 0 7 5 of negative links no dominance 34 7 24 8 and chlorophyta dominated 34 5 14 7 networks exhibited lower proportions of negative links the wide range of values observed in the no dominance networks 5 3 71 4 of negative links was associated with a more variable number of communities used for constructing networks in this group it is worth noting that the most extreme values i e 63 3 and 71 4 of negative links were observed in networks constructed with the smallest number of communities that is with n 17 20 and 20 communities in terms of average node degree the three networks differed significantly in eight out of nine thresholds combinations kruskal p value 0 05 table s8 with the networks under dominance exhibiting higher average node degree than the no dominance network dunn p value 0 05 the three networks differed significantly in terms of node betweenness for every threshold combination kruskal p value 0 001 and cyanobacteria dominated networks exhibited systematically lower values compared with other groups in terms of clustering coefficients the three networks differed significantly in eight out of nine thresholds combinations kruskal p value 0 05 with cyanobacteria dominated networks exhibiting higher values than other groups then we tested whether the biomass of a taxon was related to its centrality in the network using pearson correlation i e degree and betweenness table 5 and figure a4 and all the estimated correlation coefficients were negative in the absence of dominance centrality and biomass appeared unrelated betweenness was never significantly related to biomass across the tested threshold combinations while degree and biomass were significantly related three times as observed for the proportion of negative links these significant relationships were only observed in networks constructed with the lowest number of observations in chlorophyta dominated networks betweenness was never significantly related to biomass while node degree was related to biomass three times and only with the most stringent dominance threshold i e 0 55 in cyanobacteria dominated networks betweenness was significantly related to biomass four times while node degree was significantly related to biomass eight out of nine times 4 discussion 4 1 drivers of dominance in phytoplankton communities from the periurban waterbodies of the idf region the best predictors of the dominance status in phytoplankton communities of the periurban waterbodies of the idf region during summer were related to human pressures on these ecosystems dominance by a limited number of taxa was frequently observed 31 6 51 5 depending on the thresholds used and was mostly attributed to two phyla chlorophyta 35 5 40 6 of the cases and cyanobacteria 30 3 36 5 dominance was determined by a combination of i water column characteristics that are related to the intensity of local anthropogenic pressures tn and tn tp and meteorological conditions water temperature and stratification and ii the capacity of waterbodies to buffer these pressures surface depth or the potential for immigration of taxa from other lakes including harmful algea connection to the hydrological network our results support previous investigations showing that high n concentrations almanza et al 2018 beaver et al 2018 bonilla et al 2012 marion et al 2017 paerl and otten 2016 persaud et al 2015 and warmer waters dokulil and teubner 2000 paerl and huisman 2008 wagner and adrian 2009 favor the dominance of cyanobacteria in phytoplankton communities at large scales this is thought to be related to the particular ecological traits of these organisms mantzouki et al 2016 such as higher increase in growth rates per unit of temperature compared with other groups carey et al 2012 their ability to fix atmospheric n2 or to regulate their buoyancy in stratified water columns associated with warmer waters rinke et al 2010 regarding dominant chlorophyta taxa the most prominent genera coelastrum pediastrum and pandorina were known for their wide spatial distribution and their high abundance in meso to eutrophic freshwater ecosystems additionally these genera exhibited similar features they are known for their colonial lifestyle and for being hard to graze by zooplankton due to a combination of thick cellulose cell walls and the production of a gelatinous envelope porter 1977 further these genera are known for self regulating their vertical position and are typically blooming in early summer often preceding blooms of cyanobacteria salmaso 2000 salmaso et al 2015 the classification accuracy of mlr models was remarkable 63 80 depending on the models this approach has been compared with rf for classifying soil types and exhibited either higher bernhardt barry et al 2018 or lower performances camera et al 2017 in a more similar context o farrell et al 2019 obtained accuracy values comparable to ours while trying to classify cyanobacteria into different ecological strategies additionally mlr models were more accurate in predicting the presence than the absence of dominance which contradicts results from the above mentioned study o farrell et al 2019 this might be due to the selected variables that in our case were chosen for their expected influence on environmental characteristics within the waterbodies another explanation could be that a non dominated phytoplankton community can be observed in a wide array of environmental conditions and be composed of many combinations of organisms on the contrary dominance implies that particular organisms have been selected by a narrower set of environmental conditions in that sense it appears less complex to identify favorable than unfavorable conditions to dominance 4 2 considerations regarding the use of networks approaches networks based approaches provide an integrated and explicit representation of microbial communities opening the way for a better understanding of their structure and functioning faust and raes 2012 karimi et al 2017 here we assessed and compared the co occurrence patterns of phytoplankton organisms under the dominance by two different phyla chlorophyta and cyanobacteria and in the absence of dominance the constructed networks represent co variations in the biomass of phytoplankton organisms across space and time which could result from similar response to environmental drivers or from inter dependencies taking the form of biological interactions röttjers and faust 2018 while positive associations might result from similar niche or mutualism negative associations might reflect non overlapping niche or antagonism analyses of macro ecological networks have shown that co occurrences may better reflect niche preferences than biotic interactions freilich et al 2018 this is an important point to keep in mind as trying to infer associations using network analysis in highly heterogeneous environments might produces erroneous results röttjers and faust 2018 here we tried to avoid such bias by not considering networks as representations of biological interactions but rather as a synthetic representation of the structure of phytoplankton communities in various ecological contexts in our case phytoplankton dominance scenarii 4 3 relationships between phytoplankton communities structure functioning and co occurrence networks there is still no consensus about the ability of network based analyses to reflect biologically and or ecologically meaningful properties of environmental communities röttjers and faust 2018 in the following sections we discuss whether the observed modifications in the structure and functioning of phytoplankton communities were reflected in co occurrence networks the co occurrence networks observed in this study exhibited small world characteristics low geodesic high average degree and high efficiency and this type of network tend to be considered as robust to perturbations and the random loss of nodes peura et al 2015 watts and strogatz 1998 interestingly the test proposed by humphries and gurney 2008 suggested that under dominance networks departed from the typical small world network community richness was highly influenced by the level of dominance and the identity of dominant taxa dominance by bacillariophyta and chlorophyta was associated with a higher richness while dominance by cyanobacteria and other groups was associated with lower richness compared with the no dominance communities this was well reflected in the number of nodes composing the networks aguilera et al 2017a dokulil and teubner 2000 litchman 2003 similarly observations of reduced number of taxa in microbial communities dominated by cyanobacteria are legions bagatini et al 2014 filstrup et al 2014 holland and kinnear 2013 louati et al 2015 toporowska and pawlik skowrońska 2014 yang et al 2017a b zhao et al 2016 although composed of fewer nodes and links the cyanobacteria dominated networks can be considered as more complex than the others as exhibiting a higher link density and higher average number of links degree per node similar reductions in size and increased complexity have been reported in networks associated with microcystis aeruginosa colonies yang et al 2017a and after inoculation of freshwater mesocosms with the large colonial cyanobacteria gloeotrichia echinulata carey et al 2017 this later study reported that increasing densities g echinulata increased the richness biomass evenness and composition stability of phytoplankton communities however this study was done in oligotrophic waters and the effects of g echinulata were mostly attributed to its ability to release n and p in the environment carey et al 2014 consequently these results might be specific to the conditions testedin this study and not generalizable to a wider context on the contrary by studying 50 waterbodies that represent heterogeneous and mostly non oligotrophic environmental conditions we observed that the increasing presence of cyanobacteria was associated with higher biomass along with lower richness and evenness in addition the lowest evenness richness and number of nodes in the networks were associated with higher proportions of negative links and corresponded to conditions of dominance by cyanobacteria similar results were reported in a large scale analysis on the role of dominance in shaping microbial co occurrence networks faust et al 2015 the proportions of negative links 50 observed under cyanobacterial dominance appear relatively high regarding the values reported for other networks in the literature 12 yang et al 2017a 20 shi et al 2016 5 van goethem et al 2017 23 hu et al 2017 and 37 44 jones et al 2018 similarly many negative associations have been reported in bacterial co occurrence networks during a dolichospermum microcystis bloom guedes et al 2018 woodhouse et al 2016 the modifications of structure observed in conditions of dominance were translated in modifications of community functioning with higher biomass and efficiency of resource use n and p under dominance as observed in other studies filstrup et al 2014 gamfeldt and hillebrand 2011 hodapp et al 2015 lehtinen et al 2017 similarly we observed higher efficiency in networks under dominance as suggested by shorter distance between nodes and higher geodesic efficiency in addition community functioning depended on the identity of the dominant taxa with bacillariophyta chlorophyta and cyanobacteria reaching the highest biomass when dominant interestingly bacillariophyta reached high biomass without exhibiting high efficiency but rather when total n concentrations were very high on the contrary chlorophyta and cyanobacteria dominance were associated with elevated efficiency ruen and ruep and were observed in low tn tp ratio conditions but also across a wide range of tn and tp concentrations this suggests that these two groups are able to bloom in a wider array of environmental conditions which can explain why they were responsible for most of the cases of dominance cohesion metrics were developed to reflect the degree of connectivity in a microbial community dai et al 2019 herren and mcmahon 2018 or its complexity interconnectedness danczak et al 2018 in addition stronger cohesion negative or positive is thought to reflect the stabilizing effect of biotic interactions on community composition dai et al 2019 herren and mcmahon 2018 2017 we observed that community cohesion was the lowest and differed the most from the no dominance communities under cyanobacterial dominance this agree with studies reporting few and weak positive correlations of cyanobacterial nodes with other phyla yang et al 2017a zhao et al 2016 and suggests that these communities should be less stable however other studies at the regional scale reported higher temporal and spatial stability in community composition under the combined pressure of climate change eutrophication and cyanobacterial dominance filstrup et al 2014 monchamp et al 2018 taken together these results show that phytoplankton communities under cyanobacteria dominance exhibit a lower cohesion and less interactions between taxa but at nonetheless compositionally stable a significant negative relationship was observed between the biomass of a taxon and its centrality in the networks degree or betweenness in conditions of cyanobacteria dominance suggesting that most of the community biomass was redirected toward the outer part of the network these relationships were driven by cyanobacterial nodes which exhibited a low number of connections low degree or were located on the edges of the networks low betweenness while representing medium to high biomass cyanobacteria could redirect community biomass without participating in inter taxa interactions experimental studies testing the relationship between biodiversity and functioning in phytoplankton communities have shown that cyanobacteria exhibited a high selection low complementarity effect on community biomass behl et al 2011 gamfeldt and hillebrand 2011 in other terms they influence biomass through their high productivity and competitiveness rather than their ability to positively interact with other species to summarize the characteristics of co occurrence networks seemed to reflect the modifications of phytoplankton communities structure reduced richness lower cohesion and functioning higher biomass and rue observed in conditions of dominance reduction in community richness was reflected in the number of nodes composing the network and might be explained by the fact that environmental conditions allowing cyanobacterial dominance are suitable to fewer taxa than conditions allowing the dominance by other groups i e environment filtering dominance was associated with more complex but also smaller and more efficient networks which exhibited enhanced community functioning in addition more efficient community functioning seemed to arise through selection effect gamfeldt and hillebrand 2011 as suggested by the negative relationship between centrality and biomass in conditions of cyanobacteria dominance further the potential of organisms for inter taxa association i e connectedness was reflected in their degree in the network and dominance by organisms with low potential corresponded to lower community cohesion the isolation of a taxon represented by its low centrality and connectedness is not necessarily deleterious and may even be beneficial if it reflects its ability to fill a specific niche space for which no direct competitor exists peura et al 2015 several studies have shown that cyanobacterial dominance generates environmental conditions that are favorable to its maintenance and can consequently thus be observed for prolonged periods corcoran and boeing 2012 filstrup et al 2014 scheffer et al 1997 this might be related to specific cyanobacterial traits involved in their high biomass development e g nitrogen fixation specific co2 fixation buoyancy another hypothesis might be related to the effect of competition exclusion mechanisms on community composition aguilera et al 2017a dokulil and teubner 2000 litchman 2003 for instance cyanobacteria are more efficient than other groups for light harvesting in low light conditions generated by high biomass litchman 2003 schwaderer et al 2011 and are able to release a wide variety of allelochemical compounds dias et al 2017 holland and kinnear 2013 leflaive and ten hage 2007 to conclude it appears that the ecological particularities of this group allow their dominance in waterbodies under anthropogenic pressure and this resulted in enhanced community functioning through selection effect once established dominance creates environmental conditions favorable to its maintenance and we can hypothesize that the resulting network more complex higher density and proportion of negative links reflect the fact the remaining taxa are involved in more interactions e g commensalism mutualism competition in order to occupy the few available niches and scavenge the remaining resources 5 conclusions we used a multidisciplinary approach that combined high resolution biomass reconstruction dominance modeling using predictor variables at various scales catchment waterbody and water column biodiversity and functioning estimation at the community level and co occurrence networks this approach was successful as it provides a synthetic perspective on the causes and consequences of dominance in phytoplankton communities from 50 waterbodies in the highly populated idf region fig 3 our results support the idea that the phytoplankton composition and dominance status are directly related to i the intensity of human pressures on these ecosystems and their impact on water column characteristics total n tn tp ratio water temperature and stratification but also to ii their capacity to buffer such pressures which depends on their surface depth and connection to the hydrological network the consequences of dominance were dependent on the identity of the dominant taxa and conditions leading to cyanobacteria dominance challenge more strongly the structure and functioning of phytoplankton communities than conditions favoring the dominance by other groups finally once established this dominance appear to create condition favorables to its self maintenance as suggested by worldwide increases in the frequency and intensity of cyanobacterial blooms authors contribution ae ac mt and cb designed research and data analysis

18608,evaluating the causes and consequences of dominance by a limited number of taxa in phytoplankton communities is of huge importance in the current context of increasing anthropogenic pressures on natural ecosystems this is of particular concern in densely populated urban areas where usages and impacts of human populations on water ecosystems are strongly interconnected microbial biodiversity is commonly used as a bioindicator of environmental quality and ecosystem functioning but there are few studies at the regional scale that integrate the drivers of dominance in phytoplankton communities and their consequences on the structure and functioning of these communities here we studied the causes and consequences of phytoplankton dominance in 50 environmentally contrasted waterbodies sampled over four summer campaigns in the highly populated île de france region idf phytoplankton dominance was observed in 32 52 of the communities and most cases were attributed to chlorophyta 35 5 40 6 of cases and cyanobacteria 30 3 36 5 the best predictors of dominance were identified using multinomial logistic regression and included waterbody features surface depth and connection to the hydrological network and water column characteristics total n tn tp ratio water temperature and stratification the consequences of dominance were dependent on the identity of the dominant organisms and included modifications of biological attributes richness cohesion and functioning biomass rue of phytoplankton communities we constructed co occurrence networks using high resolution phytoplankton biomass and demonstrated that networks under dominance by chlorophyta and cyanobacteria exhibited significantly different structure compared with networks without dominance furthermore dominance by cyanobacteria was associated with more profound network modifications e g cohesion size density efficiency and proportion of negative links suggesting a stronger disruption of the structure and functioning of phytoplankton communities in the conditions in which this group dominates finally we provide a synthesis on the relationships between environmental drivers dominance

introduction continental aquatic ecosystems are considered among the most vulnerable to the combined pressure of anthropogenic activities and climate change adrian et al 2009 in the recent decades these pressures have led to an increase in the frequency and intensity of phytoplankton blooms in lakes all around the world aguilera et al 2017b almanza et al 2018 beaver et al 2018 dokulil and teubner 2000 moura et al 2018 ndlela et al 2016 paerl and huisman 2008 paerl and otten 2016 phytoplankton blooms correspond to rapid increases of primary producer s biomass often associated with the dominance of only a handful of taxa even if blooms are naturally occurring phenomena repeated dominance events have been associated with reduced number of species in eukaryotic and prokaryotic communities in lake ecosystems bagatini et al 2014 louati et al 2015 toporowska and pawlik skowrońska 2014 yang et al 2017b in addition the decomposition of phytoplankton blooms has been shown to generate greenhouse gases co2 ch4 n2o and release dissolved nutrients that can retroactively favor climate change and eutrophication li et al 2017 further biomass accumulation into a single group of primary producers can modify the resource use efficiency of phytoplankton and the transfer of biomass to zooplankton communities filstrup et al 2014 tian et al 2017 ultimately this may generate ecosystem wide modifications of food web dynamics leading to trophic collapse filstrup et al 2014 ullah et al 2018 impacting on the long term the numerous services that lakes provide to human populations vaughn 2010 this is of particular concern in densely populated urban areas where usages and impacts of human populations on lakes ecosystems are strongly interconnected surprisingly studies at the regional scale on the drivers of dominance in phytoplankton communities are still relatively scarce almanza et al 2018 or were mostly focused on cyanobacteria beaver et al 2018 marion et al 2017 o farrell et al 2019 and sometimes on only one or two species bonilla et al 2012 marmen et al 2016 moreover there is no comparison of the consequence of dominance by various organisms on the structure and functioning of phytoplankton communities there is increasing evidences that the capacity of microbial systems to support ecological functions and resist environmental forcing are emerging properties arising from the interactions between many taxa dai et al 2019 faust and raes 2012 goldford et al 2018 peura et al 2015 shi et al 2016 network based approaches provide an integrated representation of such inter taxa associations in microbial communities barberán et al 2012 deng et al 2012 and were thus recently proposed as potential indicators of environmental quality karimi et al 2017 similarly other approaches have been developed to estimate the amount of cohesion experienced by microbial communities with the underlying idea that this constitutes a fundamental yet neglected facet of the biodiversity of microbial communities dai et al 2019 danczak et al 2018 herren and mcmahon 2018 2017 most studies on planktonic networks in lakes focused on bacterial communities or were based on sequencing data van goethem et al 2017 woodhouse et al 2016 yang et al 2017a zhao et al 2016 additionally there are few studies related to the impact of dominance on the structure of phytoplankton networks carey et al 2017 moe et al 2016 despite the fact that recent studies have shown the under appreciated role of evenness the inverse of dominance in shaping microbial co occurrence networks faust et al 2015 liu et al 2019a b xue et al 2018 in addition the ability of network approaches to provide meaningful ecological information and to reflect the impact of dominance on communities is still a matter of debate röttjers and faust 2018 in this study we wanted to address two main objectives in a first time to identify the factors driving the dominance by a limited number of taxa in phytoplankton communities from periurban waterbodies located in a highly populated region and representing contrasted environmental conditions e g size depth watershed characteristics anthropogenic pressure in a second time to determine the consequences of dominance on the structure and functioning of phytoplankton communities and more particularly on the characteristics of co occurrence networks to do so we analyzed phytoplankton communities across four summer campaigns in 50 waterbodies located in the idf region and estimated the absolute biomass of taxa composing them then we combined variables at various spatial scales water column waterbody catchment to identify the drivers of dominance and analyzed its consequences on the biological and ecological characteristics of these communities our approach is based on the hypothesis that dominance should be triggered by a combination of drivers directly related to the intensity of human pressures on these ecosystems with consequences on the structure and functioning of phytoplankton communities depending on the dominant phytoplankton group 2 material and methods 2 1 study area sampling and in situ data acquisition a stratified sampling strategy was used to select 50 waterbodies figure a1 representative of the contrasted environmental conditions observed in the 248 waterbodies of idf with a surface area 5 ha catherine et al 2008 according to the chlorophyll a based oecd definition oced 1982 6 of the selected waterbodies are oligotrophic 24 mesotrophic 26 eutrophic and 44 hypereutrophic catherine et al 2010 sampling was conducted over two weeks in summers 2006 2011 2012 and 2013 where we sampled 50 48 49 and 49 waterbodies respectively providing a total of 196 phytoplankton samples to integrate spatial heterogeneity each waterbody was sampled in three stations and each station was sampled at three depths using a 5l niskin water sampler the nine samples per waterbody were pooled for microscopy analyses ammonium nh4 orthophosphate po4 3 total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp analyses were carried out using colorimetric methods previously described beck et al 1992 nitrate no3 was measured using a dx600 ion chromatograph equipped with an as14 ion pack analytical column dionex corp westmont il dissolved oxygen concentration water temperature depth and ph were measured using a multiparameter sea bird sbe 19 seacat profiler sea bird electronics inc wa the values for each of the three sampling stations were averaged to obtain a single value per waterbody 2 2 phytoplankton data phytoplankton characterization was done in triplicate from the pooled nine samples from each waterbody using an inverted microscope nikon eclipse ts100 following the utermöhl method cen european committee for standardization 2006 a minimum of 500 units single cells colonies and filaments were counted in each sample to estimate the biovolume each identified taxon was associated to a geometric shape hillebrand 1999 sun and liu 2003 for each waterbody campaign combination we measured the dimensions on 30 individuals from each taxon representing more than 5 of the total abundance and reported it in a database that was used to infer the biovolume of those taxa when they represented less than 5 of the total abundance the biovolume of rare taxa was taken from the helcom phytoplankton check list olenina et al 2006 phytoplankton carbon biomass was estimated from biovolumes assuming a density of 1 g cm 3 as suggested elsewhere filstrup et al 2014 holmes et al 1969 we estimated three proxies of phytoplankton communities functioning total community biomass was estimated as the summed phytoplankton carbon biomass in the community filstrup et al 2014 resource use efficiency rue was estimated as community biomass divided by the amount of available resources both for tp and tn ptacnik et al 2008 although the sampling strategy and the counting procedure were shown to provide accurate estimates of local taxa richness maloufi et al 2016 direct estimation of taxa richness might be biased by low detection limit of rare taxa in communities under a strong gradient of dominance to safeguard against such a bias community taxa richness was estimated from individuals counts using abundance based chao extrapolation method function estimater from the r package vegan v 3 4 4 chiu et al 2014 oksanen et al 2016 2 3 determination of taxa connectedness and community cohesion we used the recently developed cohesion framework herren and mcmahon 2018 2017 to describe the potential of individual taxon for inter taxa associations i e connectedness but also the overall degree of connectivity within communities i e cohesion first we estimated the pairwise correlation matrices between taxa across all communities separately for positive and negative correlations then we used a null model to account for bias in these correlations due to the skewed distribution of taxa biomass herren and mcmahon 2017 we followed the authors recommendations to select appropriated type of null model and after considering taxa distribution across and within communities we choose to maintain taxa average biomass while randomizing the data then expected correlations generated by the null model were subtracted from the original correlation matrices to obtain corrected correlations matrices for each taxon the average positive and negative corrected correlation corresponded to their positive and negative connectedness values respectively connectedness was estimated for the 227 taxa out of the 506 detected that appeared in at least four out of the 196 sampled communities for each community cohesion was calculated as the summed connectedness of taxa composing the community weighted by their respective biomass because positive and negative connectedness are calculated separately there are two metrics of cohesion a positive and a negative one differences in connectedness between eight phytoplankton phyla i e bacillariophyta chlorophyta cryptophyta cyanobacteria dinophyta euglenophyta chrysophyta and xantophyta were tested using kruskal wallis rank sum test and dunn test r package dunn test dinno 2017 2 4 definition and estimation of dominance the first step to identify the drivers and consequences of dominance in phytoplankton communities was to identify groups of communities under various dominance scenarii in other terms we needed to identify i whether communities were under dominance by a reduced set of taxa or not and ii what was the identity of the dominant taxon in a first time for each community we calculated a dominance index that corresponded to 1 minus the pielou evenness index estimated using biomass matrices evenness h log s with h shannon weiner diversity and s taxa richness this dominance index ranged from 0 when the biomass distribution across taxa was perfectly even to 1 when community biomass corresponded to a single taxon then this index was used to separate communities not under dominance i e with index threshold from those under dominance index threshold in a second time communities considered under dominance in step 1 were grouped according to the identity of the dominant phyla that is the phyla whose relative biomass was above a selected threshold in order to avoid biases related to the selection of a unique threshold for each of these steps we used a range of values for the dominance 0 45 0 5 0 55 and relative biomass 0 45 0 5 0 55 thresholds which generated nine thresholds combinations that were used to separate communities into various dominance groups i e not dominated and dominated by different phyla table a1 data were analyzed in a similar way for each of the nine thresholds combinations and the results were summarized across all combinations to identify the global trends in our data 2 5 identification of the drivers of dominance in phytoplankton communities to identify the environmental drivers of dominance in the idf region we used classification models and variables at the water column waterbody and catchment scales to p the dominance group in which communities belong to the set of predictor variables was defined on the basis of their assumed contribution to the environmental conditions experienced within the waterbodies and modified from table a2 catherine et al 2010 at the water column scale nutrient concentration total n and p were used to reflect the quantity of available resources while water temperature and thermal stratification were used to reflect physical conditions of the water column at the waterbody scale several predictors related to their characteristics were included mean depth and waterbody surface were used as variables reflecting the capacity of the lake to dilute nutrient loadings waterbodies position within the landscape was reflected by their altitude their connection to the hydrological network i e the network of channels connecting small rivers and waterbodies throughout the idf region or their location in a regularly flooded area at the catchment scale the ratio between catchment and waterbody size was used to reflect the loading potential of a catchment system relative to the waterbody buffering capacity almanza et al 2018 the density of drainage connections within catchments was considered as it affects the catchment s ability to transport nutrients land use variables such as the proportion of catchment surface classified as forest agricultural and urban suburban or industrial referred as impervious cover were included as they constitute variables known to affect both the quantity and nature of loading variables at the catchment scale were estimated using the carthage 3 0 hydrological database and the mos databases www iau idf fr two classification approaches were compared random forest rf using the randomforest function from the r package randomforest v 3 4 4 with n 1000 trees liaw and wiener 2002 which has been shown to accurately predict the eutrophication level of waterbodies in the region catherine et al 2010 and multinomial logistic regression mlr using the multinom function from the r package nnet v 3 4 0 venables and ripley 2002 three models were tested table a3 model 1 was the more complex and aimed at predicting the classification of communities into six groups that corresponded to the absence of dominance or the dominance by bacillariophyta chlorophyta cyanobacteria dinophyta or other phyla model 2 focused on predicting the dichotomy between dominated versus not dominated communities model 3 focused on communities under dominance and aimed at predicting the identity of the dominating taxon for each model the rf and mlr methods were compared based on the proportion of communities accurately classified in their respective group i e confusion matrices the predictor variables that contributed to the classification success were subsequently identified using likelihood ratio chi square test o farrell et al 2019 venables and ripley 2002 2 6 determination of the consequences of dominance on community level properties to determine the consequence of dominance at the community level we compared the communities under various dominance scenarii in terms of community biomass estimated taxa richness rue separately for n and p based rue and cohesion positive and negative as widely different numbers of communities composed the different dominance groups global and pairwise differences between groups were tested using non parametric kruskal wallis rank sum test and dunn test respectively r package dunn test dinno 2017 community biomass and rue were log transformed before analyses 2 7 construction and characterization of co occurrence networks co occurrence networks were used to summarize the impact of dominance by a limited number of species on the structure of phytoplankton communities deng et al 2012 albeit promising network approaches are not devoid of limitations röttjers and faust 2018 first a large number of replicates are required to create a single network as its construction relies on co variations in the biomass of taxa across communities hence only the three groups with the largest number of communities were analyzed using this approach no dominance 17 n 56 depending on the selected thresholds dominance by chlorophyta 22 n 39 and dominance by cyanobacteria 22 n n 31 second microbial data are compositional by nature faust and raes 2012 and are thus prone to spurious correlations jackson 1997 lovell et al 2011 to limit these compositional biases we used absolute taxa biomass to estimate taxa association third microbial matrices contain a large proportion of zeros a phenomenon referred as the data sparsity problem paulson et al 2013 hence organisms absent from too many samples are often excluded from the analysis in search for a trade off between the amount of available data and their reliability here networks from each group were constructed using taxa detected in more than 12 5 of communities which corresponded to a compromise between the need to keep taxa with a maximum number of observations to accurately estimate their co occurrence and the need to keep enough taxa in the analysis to construct networks that are representative of the communities observed in the field we also tried with 7 5 10 12 5 15 20 and 25 röttjers and faust 2018 another issue lies in the choice of the metric used to estimate taxa association which should be made to reduce as much as possible the number of false positives karimi et al 2017 here we used the pearson correlation which is the standard in microbial networks studies and has been successfully used in association with random matrix theory in soils deng et al 2012 wang et al 2015 rhizosphere shi et al 2016 and lakes yang et al 2017b zhao et al 2016 this index assumes linear relationships between taxa biomass and is sensitive to data sparsity and compositional issues kurtz et al 2015 however we are confident that we considered all the ways to reduce the impact of methodological biases on our correlation based analyses then random matrix theory rmt was used to objectively identify a cutoff determining which associations were kept in the final network luo et al 2006 networks were generated using the molecular ecological network analyses mena pipeline deng et al 2012 and represented using cytoscape 3 6 0 shannon et al 2003 networks are composed of nodes which correspond to individual taxon connected by links or edges that represent significant associations between nodes networks structure was characterized using indexes derived from the graph theory pavlopoulos et al 2011 and recently suggested as potential bioindicators of the state of a system karimi et al 2017 at the node level we estimated two centrality indexes describing the importance of nodes in the network node degree was defined as the number of links to this node while node betweenness was defined as the number of geodesics i e shortest path between two nodes passing through the node betweenness reflects how central and influent a node may be in the network by being on the paths relating other nodes in the network we also tested whether the biomass of a taxon was related to its centrality in the network using correlation tests cor test function in r nodes clustering coefficient was used to describe how well a node was connected with its neighbors at the network level we estimated the proportion of positive and negative links along with global network properties deng et al 2012 average geodesic distance corresponds to the average length of the shortest path between every pairs of nodes in the network geodesic efficiency reflects the size of the network while network density reflects its complexity and corresponded to the ratio between realized and potential links 3 results 3 1 characteristics of phytoplankton communities in the waterbodies of the idf region a total of 506 phytoplankton taxa corresponding to 181 genera were identified across the 196 samples four campaigns with 48 50 waterbodies 72 5 were classified at the species level and the remaining 27 5 at the genus level the generic term taxa will be used in the text to refer to the diversity unit used in this study community richness ranged from four to 213 taxa per community with an average of 42 6 27 8 the proportion of communities identified as dominated by a reduced number of taxa during summer in the idf region ranged from 31 6 to 51 5 depending on thresholds combinations used to define groups table a1 the proportion of communities not under dominance was more variable and ranged from nine to 29 two phylum the chlorophyta and the cyanobacteria represented most of the cases of dominance with 35 5 40 6 and 30 3 36 5 of dominance cases respectively the most dominant chlorophytes taxa included coelastrum polychordum botryococcus sp pediastrum boryanum pediastrum simplex pediastrum duplex and pandorina sp the most dominant cyanobacteria taxa included aphanizomenon flos aquae dolichospermum sp aphanizomenon klebahnii planktothrix agardhii dolichospermum flos aquae and microcystis aeruginosa the other phyla dominated in a smaller number of cases dinophyta 9 4 11 0 bacillariophyta 7 3 9 0 and the remaining other groups 8 8 12 5 3 2 association potential of phytoplankton organisms the inter taxa association potential i e connectedness was estimated for the 227 most occurring taxa and significant differences were observed across phyla the effect of phylum was stronger for positive than for negative connectedness kruskal wallis test p value 0 001 and 0 039 respectively supplementary figure a2 and table a4 pairwise tests revealed that cryptophyta and dinophyta exhibited significantly stronger negative connectedness than other phyla dunn test p value 0 05 table a3 however these two groups exhibited highly variable negative connectedness and were represented by a limited number of taxa n 4 and 5 respectively in terms of positive connectedness cyanobacteria differed significantly from five out of the seven other phyla dunn test p value 0 05 table a5 with the exception of xantophyta and bacillariophyta this later phyla was significantly different than chlorophyta these results position cyanobacteria apart from the other phytoplankton phyla with lower positive inter taxa association 3 3 environmental drivers of dominance in phytoplankton communities classification approaches were used to identify the environmental factors that determined the dominance status in phytoplankton communities cf table a3 for a description of data for each of the three tested models multinomial logistic regression mlr was more accurate than random forest rf to determine the dominance status of phytoplankton communities using the selected predictor variables table 1 indeed mlr accurately classified communities in 63 69 and 80 of the cases while rf accurately classified communities in 43 67 and 57 of the cases for models 1 2 and 3 respectively this was mostly due to the low accuracy of rf in categories with low sample sizes i e bacillariophyta dinophyta and others categories interestingly both models that included a no dominance category 1 and 2 exhibited a low classification accuracy for this category the predictors that contributed in the accuracy of mlr models included variables at various scales from the water column physical and chemical features to the catchment characteristics table 2 overall the variables with the highest number of significant contributions were the total n concentration followed by the water temperature the tn tp ratio and the connection of the waterbody to the hydrological network while water thermal stratification depth and waterbody surface contributed less frequently regarding the quantitative contribution to classification accuracy i e χ2 values the connection of the waterbody to the hydrological network the water temperature and tn tp ratio were the prominent variables variables representing the state of the water column and the characteristics of the waterbody were mostly influencing classification accuracy in models that included the identity of the dominant taxon models 1 and 3 in model 2 only tn tp ratio was significant across the nine tested dominance thresholds 3 4 structure and functioning of phytoplankton communities under various dominance scenarii we compared several community level properties across dominance scenarii to determine whether dominance and the identity of the dominant group were associated with differences in the structure and functioning of phytoplankton communities fig 1 all the tested variables significantly differed across groups kruskal wallis test p value 0 05 table 3 but a more detailed picture was provided by pairwise comparison table a6 in terms of total community biomass we observed a clear dichotomy with the communities dominated by bacillariophyta chlorophyta or cyanobacteria reaching a significantly higher biomass than communities from the others groups regarding community richness the effect of dominance appeared more contrasted and dependent on the identity of the dominant phylum fig 1 on one hand chlorophyta dominated communities exhibited a higher richness compared to all the groups with the exception of bacillariophyta on the other hand communities dominated by cyanobacteria and others organisms exhibited lower richness than the no dominance and the bacillariophyta groups in terms of rue two groups clearly stood out chlorophyta and cyanobacteria which were the only ones to differ significantly from the others and no dominance groups this was particularly striking for the use of nitrogen resources i e ruen in terms of community cohesion the cyanobacteria dominated communities were apart from the others exhibiting significantly lower negative and positive cohesion fig 1 to conclude the consequence of dominance on community structure and functioning appeared taxa specific and dependent on the considered community level property overall dominance by cyanobacteria showed the strongest effect on all the studied variables and tend to separate these communities from others notably in terms of cohesion dominance by chlorophyta also has strong effects on community functioning while bacillariophyta dominance seemed to have a lower albeit significant effect 3 5 characteristics of phytoplankton co occurrence networks in various dominance scenarii we constructed co occurrence networks to summarize the structure of phytoplankton communities in various scenarii of dominance by a limited number of taxa fig 2 and figure a3 this was done for the nine tested combinations of dominance index and relative biomass thresholds and for the three groups for which we had the most replicates dominance by chlorophyta or cyanobacteria and absence of dominance the pairwise similarity cutoffs estimated using rmt were similar among the three groups and across the nine thresholds combinations with average values of 0 33 0 02 0 32 0 01 and 0 32 0 03 for chlorophyta cyanobacteria and no dominance respectively comparison of observed networks topological properties with those of randomized networks indicated that networks structures were non random and unlikely due to chance the observed networks exhibited a ratio of clustering coefficient to geodesic distance higher than 1 which is thought to be characteristic of small world networks humphries and gurney 2008 this ratio was the highest in the no dominance networks 2 1 0 9 then decreased under dominance with intermediate and low values for the chlorophyta 1 5 0 3 and cyanobacteria dominated 1 2 0 1 networks the observed numbers of nodes and links decreased from the chlorophyta dominated networks the no dominance and the cyanobacteria dominated networks table 4 network density was the highest in the cyanobacteria dominated networks while the chlorophyta and no dominance networks exhibited lower and more similar density two indexes reflecting the size of the networks geodesic efficiency and average geodesic distance respectively increased and decreased from no dominance chlorophyta and cyanobacteria dominated networks the highest proportion of negative links was observed in the cyanobacteria dominated networks with on average 48 0 7 5 of negative links no dominance 34 7 24 8 and chlorophyta dominated 34 5 14 7 networks exhibited lower proportions of negative links the wide range of values observed in the no dominance networks 5 3 71 4 of negative links was associated with a more variable number of communities used for constructing networks in this group it is worth noting that the most extreme values i e 63 3 and 71 4 of negative links were observed in networks constructed with the smallest number of communities that is with n 17 20 and 20 communities in terms of average node degree the three networks differed significantly in eight out of nine thresholds combinations kruskal p value 0 05 table s8 with the networks under dominance exhibiting higher average node degree than the no dominance network dunn p value 0 05 the three networks differed significantly in terms of node betweenness for every threshold combination kruskal p value 0 001 and cyanobacteria dominated networks exhibited systematically lower values compared with other groups in terms of clustering coefficients the three networks differed significantly in eight out of nine thresholds combinations kruskal p value 0 05 with cyanobacteria dominated networks exhibiting higher values than other groups then we tested whether the biomass of a taxon was related to its centrality in the network using pearson correlation i e degree and betweenness table 5 and figure a4 and all the estimated correlation coefficients were negative in the absence of dominance centrality and biomass appeared unrelated betweenness was never significantly related to biomass across the tested threshold combinations while degree and biomass were significantly related three times as observed for the proportion of negative links these significant relationships were only observed in networks constructed with the lowest number of observations in chlorophyta dominated networks betweenness was never significantly related to biomass while node degree was related to biomass three times and only with the most stringent dominance threshold i e 0 55 in cyanobacteria dominated networks betweenness was significantly related to biomass four times while node degree was significantly related to biomass eight out of nine times 4 discussion 4 1 drivers of dominance in phytoplankton communities from the periurban waterbodies of the idf region the best predictors of the dominance status in phytoplankton communities of the periurban waterbodies of the idf region during summer were related to human pressures on these ecosystems dominance by a limited number of taxa was frequently observed 31 6 51 5 depending on the thresholds used and was mostly attributed to two phyla chlorophyta 35 5 40 6 of the cases and cyanobacteria 30 3 36 5 dominance was determined by a combination of i water column characteristics that are related to the intensity of local anthropogenic pressures tn and tn tp and meteorological conditions water temperature and stratification and ii the capacity of waterbodies to buffer these pressures surface depth or the potential for immigration of taxa from other lakes including harmful algea connection to the hydrological network our results support previous investigations showing that high n concentrations almanza et al 2018 beaver et al 2018 bonilla et al 2012 marion et al 2017 paerl and otten 2016 persaud et al 2015 and warmer waters dokulil and teubner 2000 paerl and huisman 2008 wagner and adrian 2009 favor the dominance of cyanobacteria in phytoplankton communities at large scales this is thought to be related to the particular ecological traits of these organisms mantzouki et al 2016 such as higher increase in growth rates per unit of temperature compared with other groups carey et al 2012 their ability to fix atmospheric n2 or to regulate their buoyancy in stratified water columns associated with warmer waters rinke et al 2010 regarding dominant chlorophyta taxa the most prominent genera coelastrum pediastrum and pandorina were known for their wide spatial distribution and their high abundance in meso to eutrophic freshwater ecosystems additionally these genera exhibited similar features they are known for their colonial lifestyle and for being hard to graze by zooplankton due to a combination of thick cellulose cell walls and the production of a gelatinous envelope porter 1977 further these genera are known for self regulating their vertical position and are typically blooming in early summer often preceding blooms of cyanobacteria salmaso 2000 salmaso et al 2015 the classification accuracy of mlr models was remarkable 63 80 depending on the models this approach has been compared with rf for classifying soil types and exhibited either higher bernhardt barry et al 2018 or lower performances camera et al 2017 in a more similar context o farrell et al 2019 obtained accuracy values comparable to ours while trying to classify cyanobacteria into different ecological strategies additionally mlr models were more accurate in predicting the presence than the absence of dominance which contradicts results from the above mentioned study o farrell et al 2019 this might be due to the selected variables that in our case were chosen for their expected influence on environmental characteristics within the waterbodies another explanation could be that a non dominated phytoplankton community can be observed in a wide array of environmental conditions and be composed of many combinations of organisms on the contrary dominance implies that particular organisms have been selected by a narrower set of environmental conditions in that sense it appears less complex to identify favorable than unfavorable conditions to dominance 4 2 considerations regarding the use of networks approaches networks based approaches provide an integrated and explicit representation of microbial communities opening the way for a better understanding of their structure and functioning faust and raes 2012 karimi et al 2017 here we assessed and compared the co occurrence patterns of phytoplankton organisms under the dominance by two different phyla chlorophyta and cyanobacteria and in the absence of dominance the constructed networks represent co variations in the biomass of phytoplankton organisms across space and time which could result from similar response to environmental drivers or from inter dependencies taking the form of biological interactions röttjers and faust 2018 while positive associations might result from similar niche or mutualism negative associations might reflect non overlapping niche or antagonism analyses of macro ecological networks have shown that co occurrences may better reflect niche preferences than biotic interactions freilich et al 2018 this is an important point to keep in mind as trying to infer associations using network analysis in highly heterogeneous environments might produces erroneous results röttjers and faust 2018 here we tried to avoid such bias by not considering networks as representations of biological interactions but rather as a synthetic representation of the structure of phytoplankton communities in various ecological contexts in our case phytoplankton dominance scenarii 4 3 relationships between phytoplankton communities structure functioning and co occurrence networks there is still no consensus about the ability of network based analyses to reflect biologically and or ecologically meaningful properties of environmental communities röttjers and faust 2018 in the following sections we discuss whether the observed modifications in the structure and functioning of phytoplankton communities were reflected in co occurrence networks the co occurrence networks observed in this study exhibited small world characteristics low geodesic high average degree and high efficiency and this type of network tend to be considered as robust to perturbations and the random loss of nodes peura et al 2015 watts and strogatz 1998 interestingly the test proposed by humphries and gurney 2008 suggested that under dominance networks departed from the typical small world network community richness was highly influenced by the level of dominance and the identity of dominant taxa dominance by bacillariophyta and chlorophyta was associated with a higher richness while dominance by cyanobacteria and other groups was associated with lower richness compared with the no dominance communities this was well reflected in the number of nodes composing the networks aguilera et al 2017a dokulil and teubner 2000 litchman 2003 similarly observations of reduced number of taxa in microbial communities dominated by cyanobacteria are legions bagatini et al 2014 filstrup et al 2014 holland and kinnear 2013 louati et al 2015 toporowska and pawlik skowrońska 2014 yang et al 2017a b zhao et al 2016 although composed of fewer nodes and links the cyanobacteria dominated networks can be considered as more complex than the others as exhibiting a higher link density and higher average number of links degree per node similar reductions in size and increased complexity have been reported in networks associated with microcystis aeruginosa colonies yang et al 2017a and after inoculation of freshwater mesocosms with the large colonial cyanobacteria gloeotrichia echinulata carey et al 2017 this later study reported that increasing densities g echinulata increased the richness biomass evenness and composition stability of phytoplankton communities however this study was done in oligotrophic waters and the effects of g echinulata were mostly attributed to its ability to release n and p in the environment carey et al 2014 consequently these results might be specific to the conditions testedin this study and not generalizable to a wider context on the contrary by studying 50 waterbodies that represent heterogeneous and mostly non oligotrophic environmental conditions we observed that the increasing presence of cyanobacteria was associated with higher biomass along with lower richness and evenness in addition the lowest evenness richness and number of nodes in the networks were associated with higher proportions of negative links and corresponded to conditions of dominance by cyanobacteria similar results were reported in a large scale analysis on the role of dominance in shaping microbial co occurrence networks faust et al 2015 the proportions of negative links 50 observed under cyanobacterial dominance appear relatively high regarding the values reported for other networks in the literature 12 yang et al 2017a 20 shi et al 2016 5 van goethem et al 2017 23 hu et al 2017 and 37 44 jones et al 2018 similarly many negative associations have been reported in bacterial co occurrence networks during a dolichospermum microcystis bloom guedes et al 2018 woodhouse et al 2016 the modifications of structure observed in conditions of dominance were translated in modifications of community functioning with higher biomass and efficiency of resource use n and p under dominance as observed in other studies filstrup et al 2014 gamfeldt and hillebrand 2011 hodapp et al 2015 lehtinen et al 2017 similarly we observed higher efficiency in networks under dominance as suggested by shorter distance between nodes and higher geodesic efficiency in addition community functioning depended on the identity of the dominant taxa with bacillariophyta chlorophyta and cyanobacteria reaching the highest biomass when dominant interestingly bacillariophyta reached high biomass without exhibiting high efficiency but rather when total n concentrations were very high on the contrary chlorophyta and cyanobacteria dominance were associated with elevated efficiency ruen and ruep and were observed in low tn tp ratio conditions but also across a wide range of tn and tp concentrations this suggests that these two groups are able to bloom in a wider array of environmental conditions which can explain why they were responsible for most of the cases of dominance cohesion metrics were developed to reflect the degree of connectivity in a microbial community dai et al 2019 herren and mcmahon 2018 or its complexity interconnectedness danczak et al 2018 in addition stronger cohesion negative or positive is thought to reflect the stabilizing effect of biotic interactions on community composition dai et al 2019 herren and mcmahon 2018 2017 we observed that community cohesion was the lowest and differed the most from the no dominance communities under cyanobacterial dominance this agree with studies reporting few and weak positive correlations of cyanobacterial nodes with other phyla yang et al 2017a zhao et al 2016 and suggests that these communities should be less stable however other studies at the regional scale reported higher temporal and spatial stability in community composition under the combined pressure of climate change eutrophication and cyanobacterial dominance filstrup et al 2014 monchamp et al 2018 taken together these results show that phytoplankton communities under cyanobacteria dominance exhibit a lower cohesion and less interactions between taxa but at nonetheless compositionally stable a significant negative relationship was observed between the biomass of a taxon and its centrality in the networks degree or betweenness in conditions of cyanobacteria dominance suggesting that most of the community biomass was redirected toward the outer part of the network these relationships were driven by cyanobacterial nodes which exhibited a low number of connections low degree or were located on the edges of the networks low betweenness while representing medium to high biomass cyanobacteria could redirect community biomass without participating in inter taxa interactions experimental studies testing the relationship between biodiversity and functioning in phytoplankton communities have shown that cyanobacteria exhibited a high selection low complementarity effect on community biomass behl et al 2011 gamfeldt and hillebrand 2011 in other terms they influence biomass through their high productivity and competitiveness rather than their ability to positively interact with other species to summarize the characteristics of co occurrence networks seemed to reflect the modifications of phytoplankton communities structure reduced richness lower cohesion and functioning higher biomass and rue observed in conditions of dominance reduction in community richness was reflected in the number of nodes composing the network and might be explained by the fact that environmental conditions allowing cyanobacterial dominance are suitable to fewer taxa than conditions allowing the dominance by other groups i e environment filtering dominance was associated with more complex but also smaller and more efficient networks which exhibited enhanced community functioning in addition more efficient community functioning seemed to arise through selection effect gamfeldt and hillebrand 2011 as suggested by the negative relationship between centrality and biomass in conditions of cyanobacteria dominance further the potential of organisms for inter taxa association i e connectedness was reflected in their degree in the network and dominance by organisms with low potential corresponded to lower community cohesion the isolation of a taxon represented by its low centrality and connectedness is not necessarily deleterious and may even be beneficial if it reflects its ability to fill a specific niche space for which no direct competitor exists peura et al 2015 several studies have shown that cyanobacterial dominance generates environmental conditions that are favorable to its maintenance and can consequently thus be observed for prolonged periods corcoran and boeing 2012 filstrup et al 2014 scheffer et al 1997 this might be related to specific cyanobacterial traits involved in their high biomass development e g nitrogen fixation specific co2 fixation buoyancy another hypothesis might be related to the effect of competition exclusion mechanisms on community composition aguilera et al 2017a dokulil and teubner 2000 litchman 2003 for instance cyanobacteria are more efficient than other groups for light harvesting in low light conditions generated by high biomass litchman 2003 schwaderer et al 2011 and are able to release a wide variety of allelochemical compounds dias et al 2017 holland and kinnear 2013 leflaive and ten hage 2007 to conclude it appears that the ecological particularities of this group allow their dominance in waterbodies under anthropogenic pressure and this resulted in enhanced community functioning through selection effect once established dominance creates environmental conditions favorable to its maintenance and we can hypothesize that the resulting network more complex higher density and proportion of negative links reflect the fact the remaining taxa are involved in more interactions e g commensalism mutualism competition in order to occupy the few available niches and scavenge the remaining resources 5 conclusions we used a multidisciplinary approach that combined high resolution biomass reconstruction dominance modeling using predictor variables at various scales catchment waterbody and water column biodiversity and functioning estimation at the community level and co occurrence networks this approach was successful as it provides a synthetic perspective on the causes and consequences of dominance in phytoplankton communities from 50 waterbodies in the highly populated idf region fig 3 our results support the idea that the phytoplankton composition and dominance status are directly related to i the intensity of human pressures on these ecosystems and their impact on water column characteristics total n tn tp ratio water temperature and stratification but also to ii their capacity to buffer such pressures which depends on their surface depth and connection to the hydrological network the consequences of dominance were dependent on the identity of the dominant taxa and conditions leading to cyanobacteria dominance challenge more strongly the structure and functioning of phytoplankton communities than conditions favoring the dominance by other groups finally once established this dominance appear to create condition favorables to its self maintenance as suggested by worldwide increases in the frequency and intensity of cyanobacterial blooms authors contribution ae ac mt and cb designed research and data analysis

mg min l whereas hdpe and pp remained unaltered even at chlorine doses characteristic of wastewater disinfection 150 mg min l however hdpe and ps were not completely resistant to oxidative attack by chlorination under extremely harsh conditions shifts in raman peaks and the formation of new bonds were observed these results show that plastics commonly used in consumer products can be chemically

surface sterilization chlorine is the most widely used disinfection agent in wwtps around the world and also finds application as a cleaning agent for sterilizing fish processing work areas and

matching 2 2 chlorination of microplastics experiments simulating chlorination conditions during wastewater treatment drinking water treatment and two extreme conditions by gradually increasing the chlorine concentration contact time and temperature were carried out with select types of polymers based on their abundance in the environment extreme conditions were used to observe the physical and chemical changes plastic particles can undergo in worst case scenarios which are not realistic or representative of the conditions prevailing in engineered water environments impact of chlorination on hdpe pp and ps was investigated plastic particles in the microplastics range of less than 5 mm andrady 2011 arthur et al 2009 wessel et al 2016 measuring approximately 0 05 mm 2 mm x 2 mm in size were washed with ultra pure 18 mω cm water air dried and weighed aliquots of microplastic particles of a combined mass of about 10 12 mg were placed in 20 ml scintillation glass vials measuring 28 61 mm sigma aldrich each vial was amended with a 20 mm magnetic stir bar to enable mixing reagent grade water and sodium hypochlorite solution 12 5 cl2 by weight were added to the vials to achieve the desired concentrations while the solution ph was kept in the range of 6 7 california state water resources control board 1981 usepa 1999 vials were closed with a lid and incubated at the conditions specified upon incubation microplastics were rinsed with di water dried and stored in clean 20 ml glass scintillation vials prior to analysis 2 3 chlorination chemistry and dosage both virgin plastics and environmentally weathered plastics were exposed to a cl2 concentration of 5 mg l for 30 min at a ct value of 150 mg min l wwtp conditions usepa 1999 followed by the common dechlorination procedure procedure 2004 employing sodium thiosulfate as well as cl2 concentration of 2 5 mg l for 30 min at a ct value of 75 mg min l drinking water conditions world health organization 2004 both at room temperatures two additional sets of experiments at extreme conditions which are much higher in concentration and contact time than those extant in wwtps including one set of plastics exposed to cl2 concentrations of 25 000 mg l for 1 day equivalent to a ct value of 25 g d l incubated at ambient temperature and a second set to test even harsher conditions using cl2 concentrations of 5 5 104 mg l for 1 9 days equivalent to ct values of 55 500 g d l at 65 c additional information is provided in the supporting information si environmentally weathered plastics sourced from an asian beach available only for hdpe and pp were analyzed according to the same protocol detailed above the ph range of 6 7 was maintained for all of the experiments to ensure the maximum availability of hypochlorous acid 1 h2o naocl hocl naoh 2 hocl hcl cl2 h2o 3 2 naocl h2so4 na2so4 2 hocl 2 4 concentration time ct values effective ct values were calculated using 4 ct c t where c is the concentration of chlorine mg l and t is the time in minutes mg min l 2 5 dechlorination dosage dechlorination or quenching of free chlorine was carried out using powdered sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 at a dose of 12 mg l immediately after the chlorination reaction was concluded exposed microplastics then were removed rinsed with di water air dried and analyzed using raman spectroscopy 2 6 raman spectroscopy micro raman imaging was carried out using a renishaw invia confocal microscope and raman spectrometer renishaw invia london uk at magnifications of 5x 20x 50x and 100x and a numerical aperture of 0 75 samples were analyzed using a 15 mw laser of a 488 nm wavelength at 5 10 laser intensity with exposure times of 10 15 s silicon 111 wafer material served as the calibration standard in all experiments focusing was achieved incrementally using the 5x 20x and finally using 50x lenses obtained spectra were exported to origin pro data analysis software for data processing the baseline was corrected using the baseline correction feature in origin pro and peak heights were normalized to 1 0 to study relative changes in peak height ratios absolute intensity plots were obtained as an average of multiple readings of raman intensity plotted against the time n 3 3 results chemical changes in the microplastics were investigated with raman spectroscopy by comparing obtained spectra from polymers before and after chlorine exposure given the widespread use of both plastic polymers and chlorine disinfection one would expect conventional polymers to be fairly resistant to oxidative attack during sterilization indeed no changes visible to the naked eye were apparent in plastics exposed to chlorine at ct values of 75 mg min l and 150 mg min l however use of raman spectroscopy revealed that plastics are by no means completely resistant to chlorine attack whereas the susceptibility of plastics to chemical degradation varied by polymer type all three materials investigated showed some characteristic alterations detectable as changes in raman intensity complete disappearance of raman peaks correlating to the breaking of a chemical bonds and emergence of new raman peaks indicative of the formation of new chemical bonds particularly under very aggressive chlorine dosage regimes not extant during water treatment 3 1 hdpe degradation the chemical structure of hdpe was not altered at dosages reflective of drinking water treatment and wastewater treatment however notable peak shifts and new peaks were observed at escalated dosages of 25 g d l fig 1 notable raman peaks for hdpe included 1064 cm 1 c c c asymmetrical chain 1130 cm 1 c c c symmetrical chain 1295 cm 1 ch2 twist and 1416 cm 1 ch2 bend coluthup et al 1975 larkin 2011 pigeon et al 1991 which shifted at a higher chlorine dose hinting at a force of compression on the peaks due to intense chlorination eichhorn et al 2001 no significant shifts were observed at 75 and 150 mg min l which signified that chlorine doses used during drinking water and wastewater treatment are not strong enough to cause chemical changes in hdpe microplastics the method detection limit mdl for each new bond formed was calculated as three times the average signal to noise ratio of the 0 mg min l hdpe spectra for the three replicates introduction of a new chlorine carbon bond cl ch2 c h is evidenced by the peak at 678 cm 1 in fig 1a 3 2 polypropylene degradation polypropylene pp is used in many commercial scientific and industrial applications the widespread use of pp motivated its selection for studying its potential for oxidative degradation during chlorination in contrast to hdpe pp was found to be essentially resistant to chlorination no new peaks or disappearance of bonds were observed in the raman spectra of pp even at very high chlorine dosages and extended exposure times see fig 2 the minor changes in peak intensity observed in these extreme conditions can be considered as being negligible 3 3 polystyrene degradation polystyrene is widely used in manufacturing of foams coffee cup lids restaurant to go containers and floatation materials at docks because of its low cost of production and vast utility the twin peaks at 400 cm 1 and 445 cm 1 were observed to widen at moderate ct values 75 and 150 mg min l eventually giving rise to a new peak at 348 cm 1 in extreme chlorination conditions widening of a peak is synonymous with the partial degradation of a bond in this case as a result of oxidative stress in extreme conditions a peak shift was detected at the higher wave numbers indicating a compression action eichhorn et al 2001 on the bond corresponding to 445 cm 1 shifting of the aliphatic c h backbone from 2901 cm 1 to 2940 cm 1 also was observed fig 3 b at the highest chlorine dosage and a widening of peaks at the more modest chlorination dosages indicating polymer degradation the detected shift gradually progressed to 2940 cm 1 over time this shift of the backbone bond towards a higher wavenumber signifies the force of compression on the backbone bond towards a state of higher energy eichhorn et al 2001 additionally a study done on chlorine degradation of ps and poly styrene b butadiene b styrene ftir analysis revealed the presence of chlorine at both the aliphatic and aromatic positions of ps zebger et al 2003 a direct oxidative attack on the backbone of a polymer was possible because of the absence of both plasticizers and annealing of the plastics before chlorination thus the presence of plastic additives and thermal treatments can play a major role in altering the plastic structure even with a strong oxidant like chlorine 3 4 differential scanning calorimetry dsc differential scanning calorimetry is a useful technique for assessing the physical characteristics of polymers the dsc analysis of plastics exposed to extreme chlorination conditions yielded a significant change indicated by altered melting point characteristics of stressed plastics see supporting information no such changes were expected to occur under the softer disinfection techniques that lacked such strong structural changes as determined previously by raman spectroscopy 3 5 dechlorination dechlorination is practiced primarily in the treatment of wastewater to remove residual disinfectant prior to reclaiming of treated effluent via discharge to surface waters exposure of the three polymers to the one dechlorination agent primarily used in wastewater treatment powdered sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 at a dose of 12 mg l did not result in any noticeable changes as determined by raman spectrometry 3 6 chlorination of environmentally weathered plastics microplastics in water and wastewater may have diverse origins and potentially may have been subjected to weathering in one or multiple environmental settings when environmentally weathered plastics made from hdpe and pp were exposed to chlorination and dechlorination agents the resultant spectra yielded no observable changes different from what was observed with virgin materials see si however the spectra of environmental mps in general displayed more baseline variation potentially indicating rougher surface characteristics that caused the raman laser focal point to deviate producing more noisy signals 3 7 study limitations this study yielded new data and insights into the behavior of commercial polymers during chlorination but it also had some limitations all experiments were carried out with reagent grade water in real world chlorination applications the presence of other pollutants microorganisms and biofilms may alter the extent of structural changes observable due to competitive reactions and chlorine quenching thus the effective dosage of chlorine available for interaction with drinking water and particularly wastewater borne microplastics may be smaller than the dosages used here therefore the results reported are conservative and represent a worst case scenario as mentioned previously the extreme doses of 2 5 104 mg l at 24 h contact time and 5 5 104 mg l at 1 9 days contact time are not representative of the conditions prevalent in wastewater or drinking water treatment plants this study focused on the effects of naclo on three plastic types based on their abundance other disinfectants cl2 gas ozone chlorine dioxide and uv used at treatment plants may yield different effects on polymer structure and properties additionally this study focused exclusively on polymers in isolation leaving uncertain any potential interactions of chlorine with plasticizers that may be formulated into plastic polymers hahladakis et al 2018 mitroka et al 2013 4 conclusions this research demonstrates that commercial plastic polymers which are in widespread use globally have the potential to be structurally and physically altered when contacted with chlorine as a sterilization agent favorable findings were that all plastics exhibited an appreciable degree or even a very strong degree of resistance to oxidative attack by chlorine specifically for hdpe and pp it was found that disinfection conditions prevailing at drinking water and wastewater treatment plants are not aggressive enough to lead to detectable and important changes in these polymeric materials however ps was an exception to this conclusion as this polymer exhibited detectable changes in structure even at ct values as low as 75 and 150 mg min l from an ecotoxicological perspective the discovery of the formation of new chlorine carbon bonds during chlorination of hdpe under extreme dosages was the most noteworthy finding whereas the harsh conditions tested here will be rarely met in typical industrial settings collected data suggest that chlorination of polymers does have the potential to introduce new structural features of elevated ecotoxicological and human health concern specifically the de novo formation of chlorine carbon bonds as observed here in hdpe microplastics overall the data collected in this work may inform a better assessment of types and magnitudes of risks posed by wastewater borne and sewage sludge

hdpe pp and ps was investigated plastic particles in the microplastics range of less than 5 mm andrady 2011 arthur et al 2009 wessel et al 2016 measuring approximately 0 05 mm 2 mm x 2 mm in size were washed with ultra pure 18 mω cm water air dried and weighed aliquots of microplastic particles of a combined mass of about 10 12 mg were placed in 20 ml scintillation glass vials measuring 28 61 mm sigma aldrich each vial was amended with a 20 mm magnetic stir bar to enable mixing reagent grade water and sodium hypochlorite solution 12 5 cl2 by weight were added to the vials to achieve the desired concentrations while the solution ph was kept in the range of 6 7 california state water resources control board 1981 usepa 1999 vials were closed with a lid and incubated at the conditions specified upon incubation microplastics were rinsed with di water dried and stored in clean 20 ml glass scintillation vials prior to analysis 2 3 chlorination chemistry and dosage both virgin plastics and environmentally weathered plastics were exposed to a cl2 concentration of 5 mg l for 30 min at a ct value of 150 mg min l wwtp conditions usepa 1999 followed by the common dechlorination procedure procedure 2004 employing sodium thiosulfate as well as cl2 concentration of 2 5 mg l for 30 min at a ct value of 75 mg min l drinking water conditions world health organization 2004 both at room temperatures two additional sets of experiments at extreme conditions which are much higher in concentration and contact time than those extant in wwtps including one set of plastics exposed to cl2 concentrations of 25 000 mg l for 1 day equivalent to a ct value of 25 g d l incubated at ambient temperature and a second set to test even harsher conditions using cl2 concentrations of 5 5 104 mg l for 1 9 days equivalent to ct values of 55 500 g d l at 65 c additional information is provided in the supporting information si environmentally weathered plastics sourced from an asian beach available only for hdpe and pp were analyzed according to the same protocol detailed above the ph range of 6 7 was maintained for all of the experiments to ensure the maximum availability of hypochlorous acid 1 h2o naocl hocl naoh 2 hocl hcl cl2 h2o 3 2 naocl h2so4 na2so4 2 hocl 2 4 concentration time ct values effective ct values were calculated using 4 ct c t where c is the concentration of chlorine mg l and t is the time in minutes mg min l 2 5 dechlorination dosage dechlorination or quenching of free chlorine was carried out using powdered sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 at a dose of 12 mg l immediately after the chlorination reaction was concluded exposed microplastics then were removed rinsed with di water air dried and analyzed using raman spectroscopy 2 6 raman spectroscopy micro raman imaging was carried out using a renishaw invia confocal microscope and raman spectrometer renishaw invia london uk at magnifications of 5x 20x 50x and 100x and a numerical aperture of 0 75 samples were analyzed using a 15 mw laser of a 488 nm wavelength at 5 10 laser intensity with exposure times of 10 15 s silicon 111 wafer material served as the calibration standard in all experiments focusing was achieved incrementally using the 5x 20x and finally using 50x lenses obtained spectra were exported to origin pro data analysis software for data processing the baseline was corrected using the baseline correction feature in origin pro and peak heights were normalized to 1 0 to study relative changes in peak height ratios absolute intensity plots were obtained as an average of multiple readings of raman intensity plotted against the time n 3 3 results chemical changes in the microplastics were investigated with raman spectroscopy by comparing obtained spectra from polymers before and after chlorine exposure given the widespread use of both plastic polymers and chlorine disinfection one would expect conventional polymers to be fairly resistant to oxidative attack during sterilization indeed no changes visible to the naked eye were apparent in plastics exposed to chlorine at ct values of 75 mg min l and 150 mg min l however use of raman spectroscopy revealed that plastics are by no means completely resistant to chlorine attack whereas the susceptibility of plastics to chemical degradation varied by polymer type all three materials investigated showed some characteristic alterations detectable as changes in raman intensity complete disappearance of raman peaks correlating to the breaking of a chemical bonds and emergence of new raman peaks indicative of the formation of new chemical bonds particularly under very aggressive chlorine dosage regimes not extant during water treatment 3 1 hdpe degradation the chemical structure of hdpe was not altered at dosages reflective of drinking water treatment and wastewater treatment however notable peak shifts and new peaks were observed at escalated dosages of 25 g d l fig 1 notable raman peaks for hdpe included 1064 cm 1 c c c asymmetrical chain 1130 cm 1 c c c symmetrical chain 1295 cm 1 ch2 twist and 1416 cm 1 ch2 bend coluthup et al 1975 larkin 2011 pigeon et al 1991 which shifted at a higher chlorine dose hinting at a force of compression on the peaks due to intense chlorination eichhorn et al 2001 no significant shifts were observed at 75 and 150 mg min l which signified that chlorine doses used during drinking water and wastewater treatment are not strong enough to cause chemical changes in hdpe microplastics the method detection limit mdl for each new bond formed was calculated as three times the average signal to noise ratio of the 0 mg min l hdpe spectra for the three replicates introduction of a new chlorine carbon bond cl ch2 c h is evidenced by the peak at 678 cm 1 in fig 1a 3 2 polypropylene degradation polypropylene pp is used in many commercial scientific and industrial applications the widespread use of pp motivated its selection for studying its potential for oxidative degradation during chlorination in contrast to hdpe pp was found to be essentially resistant to chlorination no new peaks or disappearance of bonds were observed in the raman spectra of pp even at very high chlorine dosages and extended exposure times see fig 2 the minor changes in peak intensity observed in these extreme conditions can be considered as being negligible 3 3 polystyrene degradation polystyrene is widely used in manufacturing of foams coffee cup lids restaurant to go containers and floatation materials at docks because of its low cost of production and vast utility the twin peaks at 400 cm 1 and 445 cm 1 were observed to widen at moderate ct values 75 and 150 mg min l eventually giving rise to a new peak at 348 cm 1 in extreme chlorination conditions widening of a peak is synonymous with the partial degradation of a bond in this case as a result of oxidative stress in extreme conditions a peak shift was detected at the higher wave numbers indicating a compression action eichhorn et al 2001 on the bond corresponding to 445 cm 1 shifting of the aliphatic c h backbone from 2901 cm 1 to 2940 cm 1 also was observed fig 3 b at the highest chlorine dosage and a widening of peaks at the more modest chlorination dosages indicating polymer degradation the detected shift gradually progressed to 2940 cm 1 over time this shift of the backbone bond towards a higher wavenumber signifies the force of compression on the backbone bond towards a state of higher energy eichhorn et al 2001 additionally a study done on chlorine degradation of ps and poly styrene b butadiene b styrene ftir analysis revealed the presence of chlorine at both the aliphatic and aromatic positions of ps zebger et al 2003 a direct oxidative attack on the backbone of a polymer was possible because of the absence of both plasticizers and annealing of the plastics before chlorination thus the presence of plastic additives and thermal treatments can play a major role in altering the plastic structure even with a strong oxidant like chlorine 3 4 differential scanning calorimetry dsc differential scanning calorimetry is a useful technique for assessing the physical characteristics of polymers the dsc analysis of plastics exposed to extreme chlorination conditions yielded a significant change indicated by altered melting point characteristics of stressed plastics see supporting information no such changes were expected to occur under the softer disinfection techniques that lacked such strong structural changes as determined previously by raman spectroscopy 3 5 dechlorination dechlorination is practiced primarily in the treatment of wastewater to remove residual disinfectant prior to reclaiming of treated effluent via discharge to surface waters exposure of the three polymers to the one dechlorination agent primarily used in wastewater treatment powdered sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 at a dose of 12 mg l did not result in any noticeable changes as determined by raman spectrometry 3 6 chlorination of environmentally weathered plastics microplastics in water and wastewater may have diverse origins and potentially may have been subjected to weathering in one or multiple environmental settings when environmentally weathered plastics made from hdpe and pp were exposed to chlorination and dechlorination agents the resultant spectra yielded no observable changes different from what was observed with virgin materials see si however the spectra of environmental mps in general displayed more baseline variation potentially indicating rougher surface characteristics that caused the raman laser focal point to deviate producing more noisy signals 3 7 study limitations this study yielded new data and insights into the behavior of commercial polymers during chlorination but it also had some limitations all experiments were carried out with reagent grade water in real world chlorination applications the presence of other pollutants microorganisms and biofilms may alter the extent of structural changes observable due to competitive reactions and chlorine quenching thus the effective dosage of chlorine available for interaction with drinking water and particularly wastewater borne microplastics may be smaller than the dosages used here therefore the results reported are conservative and represent a worst case scenario as mentioned previously the extreme doses of 2 5 104 mg l at 24 h contact time and 5 5 104 mg l at 1 9 days contact time are not representative of the conditions prevalent in wastewater or drinking water treatment plants this study focused on the effects of naclo on three plastic types based on their abundance other disinfectants cl2 gas ozone chlorine dioxide and uv used at treatment plants may yield different effects on polymer structure and properties additionally this study focused exclusively on polymers in isolation leaving uncertain any potential interactions of chlorine with plasticizers that may be formulated into plastic polymers hahladakis et al 2018 mitroka et al 2013 4 conclusions this research demonstrates that commercial plastic polymers which are in widespread use globally have the potential to be structurally and physically altered when contacted with chlorine as a sterilization agent favorable findings were that all plastics exhibited an appreciable degree or even a very strong degree of resistance to oxidative attack by chlorine specifically for hdpe and pp it was found that disinfection conditions prevailing at drinking water and wastewater treatment plants are not aggressive enough to lead to detectable and important changes in these polymeric materials however ps was an exception to this conclusion as this polymer exhibited detectable changes in structure even at ct values as low as 75 and 150 mg min l from an ecotoxicological perspective the discovery of the formation of new chlorine carbon bonds during chlorination of hdpe under extreme dosages was the most noteworthy finding whereas the harsh conditions tested here will be rarely met in typical industrial settings collected data suggest that chlorination of polymers does have the potential to introduce new structural features of elevated ecotoxicological and human health concern specifically the de novo formation of chlorine carbon bonds as observed here in hdpe microplastics overall the data collected in this work may inform a better assessment of types and magnitudes of risks posed by wastewater borne and sewage sludge borne microplastics destined respectively for discharge into receiving surface waters and for application on land funding this project was supported in part by award ltr 05 01 12 of the virginia g
