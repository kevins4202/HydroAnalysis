15950,stormwater hazards are a significant threat across the globe these are continuing to increase in line with urbanisation and climate change leading to a recognition that the historic paradigm of passive management using centralised infrastructure is insufficient to manage future hazards to our society environment and economy the cross sector internet of things revolution has inspired a new generation of smart stormwater management systems which offer an effective cost beneficial and adaptive solution to enhance network capacities and reduce hazards however despite growing prominence within research this technology remains under utilised in a large part due to fragmented and inconsistent alignment and terminology obscuring the strategic co ordination of research we respond to this through systematically reviewing the terminology practice and trajectory for smart stormwater management and developing a framework which can be applied to both coordinate and understand the existing research landscape as well as identifying key research gaps for future development we find that literature almost universally agrees that smart technology is or will be beneficial to stormwater management and that technology has reached partial maturity in terms of quantity management although this has not yet transferred to water quality however research is dominated by proof of concept modelling studies with limited practical application beyond real time control of large assets individual pilot studies and monitoring we recommend that future research explores and evidences the substantial benefits likely through expanding current implementation towards a coordinated decentralised and optimised catchment scale approach graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords active control internet of things iot real time control rtc smart systems smart water management stormwater 1 introduction stormwater hazards created through intense rainfall overwhelming drainage systems generate enormous impacts to our societies environments and economies at a global scale ipcc 2014 defra 2018 historically these hazards have been managed through extensive deployment of passive infrastructure across cities and catchments butler et al 2018 this has been predominantly achieved through implementing subterranean grey infrastructure with a contemporary drive towards increasing application of green infrastructure to extend the scope of stormwater management across catchment surfaces and buildings wong and brown 2009 cettner 2012 fletcher et al 2015 scholz 2015 however current predictions highlight that the scale of stormwater hazards is increasing at a rate far higher than previously anticipated wing et al 2018 swain et al 2020 consequently there is a growing realisation that managing stormwater using passive networks of the twentieth century is insufficient to meet the needs of the future and instead more cost effective adaptable and sustainable use of existing networks can be achieved through deploying smart technology bartos et al 2018 yuan et al 2019 xu et al 2021 the concept of smart stormwater and smart cities has emerged from the cross sector internet of things iot revolution atzori et al 2010 oberascher et al 2022 where cost effective and multi functional sensing communication actuation and optimisation devices installed to monitor control and optimise operation have become ubiquitous across various network infrastructures notably including power and communication systems weiser et al 1999 edmondson et al 2018 translating cross sector advances in iot to achieve smart stormwater management has the potential to enable cost effective management of day to day operations alongside adaptability to reconfigure operation and enhance resilience to manage extreme events mullapudi et al 2017 2018 xu et al 2021 whilst also retaining opportunities for re assessment and upgrade of future operation procedures dirckx et al 2011 altobelli et al 2020 however despite a growing prominence within research the adoption of emerging smart technology remains constrained by several key challenges of pertinence being a fragmented inconsistent and confusing terminology gourbesville 2016 as with other potentially transformative step changes in water management for example resilience davoudi et al 2012 and nature based solutions schanze 2017 there is a real risk that application of the term smart can be constrained as a buzzword with the vernacular applied in a non specific manner to describe a range of tangential applications this is exacerbated by ubiquitous application and claims regarding what smart is creating ambiguity and uncertainty with regards to mapping the overarching progress of where smart stormwater research is now and what the next research steps should be on to a consistent knowledge framework in this review we aim to address these gaps through 1 reviewing smart technology research in the field of stormwater management 2 providing a resource to align terminology 3 mapping research onto a consistent knowledge framework to facilitate clear identification of the progress to date 4 identifying the research gaps and barriers to propose further studies for the systematic and meaningful development of smart stormwater management 2 clarifying the terminology the use of smart technology as a term is ubiquitous across every day discourse science governance and practice although arguably far more so in fields such as energy telecommunications heating cooling and ventilation hvac than in stormwater hydrology and hydraulics while the use of smart technology as a general descriptor has the advantage of attracting interest from decision makers policy makers and even the public fletcher et al 2015 there is a risk that such general terms will lead to confusion about what is actually meant when describing scientific progress and needs clear dissemination of knowledge requires consistent application of terminology such that the audience understands the nature scope and intent of proposed approaches in this review we use a range of terms to describe similar but subtly different applications of smart technology in an attempt to link our discussion to the sources of literature from which it is drawn to avoid confusion we attempt to define the terms we use in the following section we argue that in an evolving field such as this there is a need for authors to clearly define the terms they are using doing so will not only help to ensure clarity of communication within the stormwater discipline but help to open up the discussion to other related disciplines such as system optimisation and control green infrastructure urban planning and even urban ecology smart technology smart technology encapsulates technologies able to sense monitor collect data communicate manage analyse integrate control or optimise devices in a systematic manner this includes both standalone devices with integrated smart features and technologies which can be retrofitted to enhance the capabilities of other devices assets or networks this definition covers a wide range of technologies encapsulating varying degrees of smartness and leading to the fragmented and inconsistent application of smart technologies within current research as such we will develop a framework within this paper to facilitate this range of technologies and capabilities to be benchmarked and compared real time control rtc in terms of stormwater management the term smart is a progression from an established research field in real time control rtc james 1984 kändler et al 2020b sadler et al 2020 xu et al 2021 campisano et al 2013 provide a succinct summary of components and terminology in rtc systems including actuators controllers sensors and telemetry passive active control passive control systems typically rely on hydraulic conditions to alter the discharge rate from a given asset they include orifices vortex flow controls and weirs passive systems might include some degree of smartness if they are monitored e g via telemetry reporting the water level an active control system can permit some form of intervention at an asset typically involving a device such as an actuator the actuator may be driven by local or global control systems active control does not include assets which can control flow velocities using mechanical principles such as vortex flow controls internet of things iot the internet of things describes the interconnection of devices both physical and virtual to the internet and to other connected devices ibm 2016 in the context of smart stormwater this encapsulates all elements of smart technology including hardware and software 3 state of the art 3 1 global literature review we used the terminology identified in our evaluation of what smart stormwater systems are to explore the maturity of existing stormwater literature using a systematic literature review set into three stages our initial stage included conducting a global search of literature based on the scopus indexed research database we searched for all literature which included the keywords smart smarter active control real time control and hyphenated variations thereof or rtc and stormwater or storm water within the title abstract or keywords this search returned 319 documents as of 7th may 2021 we then applied filters to refine our selection to publication in journals as an article or review which resulted in 154 documents and removed any non english documents due to our inability to accurately assess their content in total this process retained 145 documents our final process was a manual review of all remaining abstracts to ensure that the title abstract and key words accurately reflected smart stormwater technology we found that the word smart proved a popular basis for acronyms and as an adjective describing decision making based on non iot linked advances and after discounting these non relevant documents we were left with a collection of 94 documents fig 1 shows the cumulative publication of smart stormwater articles according to our search procedure the earliest recorded article is from 1984 and from there a slow steady rate of publication is apparent through to the late 1990 s with publication accelerating through 2000 2015 and again during the past five years this trend aligns with the growth of articles citing smart technology across all disciplines in the scopus database highlighting the increasing potential of smart systems and their increasing utilisation across disciplines fig 2 which accelerates during the past decade and has more than doubled in the past five years we note that our search terms and procedure will not capture the full range of smart stormwater systems within the global discourse however the scopus database represents a significant proportion of sources with over 75 million records and 23 500 journals from 5 000 publishers scopus 2019 as such this provides a strong indication of publication history to draw general conclusions whilst acknowledging some articles may not have been captured within the search we also note that we have been unable to compare the trajectory of outputs including these terms with the overall number of publications in the scopus database year on year therefore although we identify the increasing use of terms we cannot determine how this increasing prominence relates to the overall increase in papers over the period in our analysis of titles from our literature search we have identified a trajectory of smart stormwater systems with key themes emerging over the past four decades of research this section outlines these key themes and publications our intention of identifying and evaluating these themes is two fold firstly to draw together a comprehensive narrative describing research to date with regards to smart stormwater identifying the state of the art and the state of the possible and secondly using our review to map the future trajectory and research needs to achieve the benefits of smart stormwater for communities and the environment through evaluating research across a consistent theoretical framework in subsequent sections of our paper 3 2 centralised real time control of large infrastructure many early adopters of smart technology applied the term rtc technology to describe controlling assets through actuation in response to sensors with application predominantly driven by cost benefit factors at large infrastructure projects such as sewer trunk mains and reservoirs james 1984 campisano et al 2013 the earliest discussion of smart stormwater found using our search terms was in 1984 where bill james evaluated the use of rtc as an emerging technology to support urban runoff forecasting and reservoir operation james 1984 although this is an example of an early transfer of the rtc approach to stormwater through discussion within the paper it is apparent that james did not coin this term and that the concept of rtc already existed within engineering discourse therefore it is very likely that the concepts of rtc had been discussed significantly prior to this early conversation also commonly took place alongside an evaluation of applying emerging hydraulic modelling software to develop rtc schemes for storm sewer systems clearly highlighting that at the time the essential factor in success was the limitations in accuracy and processing capabilities for running hydraulic modelling cardle 1991 however despite these technical limitations basic implementation on large infrastructure was considered possible from the early 1990 s schilling 1994 and deployment of rtc in sewers continued with case studies developing through literature from the early 1990 s onwards kwan et al 1993 mccann 1993 rtc gradually entered the mainstream scientific consensus regarding best practice for effectively utilising available space in urban drainage systems although was still considered state of the art ellis and marsalek 1996 urban storm drainage 1996 weyand 2002 in the mid 1990 s rtc principles and tools began to enter mainstream products and practice with commercial software such as hydroworks pm being developed and sold to planners and utility providers hayes 1994 examples of implementation from this era are almost exclusively in the control of large infrastructure features including sewer mains and wastewater treatment reflecting limitations in monitoring data computation communication and cost this application to large scale infrastructure remains today with rtc frequently described as a solution to issues of network capacity such as combined sewer overflow cso spills campisano et al 2016 it is worth noting one authors comments regarding this combined sewer overflows which discharge untreated sewage under storm conditions are an old headache for the water industry wyman 1994 a sobering thought given ongoing unprecedented issues and calls to respond to the same challenges almost three decades later the rivers trust 2019 ukwir 2019 3 3 integration towards a network scale in the early 2000 s advances in measurement technology enabled wider monitoring of the stormwater system with multiple sensors throughout networks feeding control data from physical assets including sewers treatment plants and receiving waters schütze et al 2004 however as with previous application the costs uncertainties and limitations in sensor distribution meant that active control remained limited to large strategic assets operated by utility companies the commercial introduction of geographic information systems in the 1990 s presented an opportunity for a wider consideration interpretation and management of geospatial data supporting concepts such as catchment and network management becoming more visual and actionable skop and loaiciga 1998 throughout the 2000 s the scope scale and complexity of what was considered to be the stormwater network began to increase with studies introducing new concepts such as water sensitive urban design wong and eadie 2000 and technologies such as sensor networks fenner 2000 ruggaber et al 2007 and data driven analysis of runoff using rainfall radars vieux and vieux 2005 of pertinence to rtc was the developing implementation of sensors with studies demonstrating sophisticated control using widespread decentralised sensing across sewer infrastructure ruggaber et al 2007 it is around this time that smart began to enter and proliferate through the stormwater vernacular fig 1 much in line with the popularity of this term across scientific literature fig 2 despite the growing prominence of rtc within urban water literature the technology has not yet developed from individual projects to mass application common issues for the lack of implementation were reported including high costs of implementation and uncertainty over operational success schütze et al 2008 working groups such as the german dwa dwa 2005 began to prepare rtc guidelines for sewer systems and reviews indicated the cost effectiveness of installing rtc to manage network capacity whilst also retaining adaptive capacity for later re assessment and upgrade of control measures dirckx et al 2011 altobelli et al 2020 however despite advances implementation remained targeted at the operation of large single infrastructures rather than distributed iot applications 3 4 optimisation of smart systems in parallel with the advancement of network scale monitoring development of optimal real time control strategies was also underway for example using genetic algorithms rauch and harremoës 1999 cembrano et al 2004 rathnayake and faisal anwar 2019 eulogi et al 2021 wang et al 2021 neural networks darsono and labadie 2007 zhang et al 2018 mullapudi et al 2020 saliba et al 2020 and fuzzy logic control li 2020 research in this area has developed with recent reviews by shishegar et al 2018 indicating significant progress across aspects of optimising rtc to achieve effective performance across networks however catchment scale rtc which encapsulates the full range of assets across a network remains a significant challenge to address and even in the modern era many optimisation algorithms are not applied to networks in real time due to computational costs rathnayake and faisal anwar 2019 in particular increasing data and complexity of interconnected systems has yet to take into account feedback loops between multi sector smart system capabilities and operators of such systems at a synergistic city scale jose et al 2015 fenner 2017 meng et al 2017 the majority of optimisation approaches tend towards water quantity flooding cso and network capacity management as opposed to water quality functions campisano et al 2013 this is predominantly because the components needed to monitor quantity have reached a mature stage with sensing actuation and telecommunication technology all reliably available versus water quality technology in particular sensors which are still not at a sufficient reliability or scale of application for real time feedback this is often due to the time lag between water quality samples being taken and then analysed in a lab versus the near instantaneous nature of water level monitoring in recent years proxies such as colour turbidity and dissolved oxygen concentration have been applied to advance this field often feeding forward rtc to control downstream treatment options hoppe et al 2011 lacour and schütze 2011 recent research has also investigated asset scale rtc of green infrastructure to enhance water quality in laboratory environments shen et al 2020 which could be upscaled in future iterations of projects significant sensor networks have begun to be deployed to support the data required for this with examples including large scale demonstrators such as that in lille abbas et al 2017 where a demonstrator representing a town of 25 000 people installed flow and turbidity sensors on wastewater with links to smart city functionality of sewage potable water energy and heat sensors distributed across buildings networks and campus infrastructure however this action remains focused on monitoring data gathering and offline optimisation as opposed to active and responsive real time optimisation and control 3 5 the role of short term forecasting in smart stormwater the most significant progress integrating catchment scale data within smart stormwater has been through integration of weather data and short term forecasting or nowcasting within rtc of networks xu et al 2020 at its simplest level this involves prediction of future network states using rainfall for example to deploy early flood warnings a practice which has existed for a long time plate 2002 yet development of more powerful computational modelling at a price point which enables distribution alongside high resolution input data i e weather radar has now led to integration of rainfall radar in managing large sewer systems iwra and k water 2018 tabuchi et al 2020 this has been developed through two main approaches data gathered from internal sewer network monitoring systems and nowcasting based on external conditions the most straight forward approach is to implement a local active control loop this is achieved through continuous monitoring the internal state of assets or networks linked with automated control to optimise performance one component at a time kändler et al 2020b lund et al 2020 at an asset scale this may include monitoring water levels in tanks or basins melville shreeve et al 2016 parolari et al 2018 or at a network scale this could include monitoring of upstream conditions to regulate flow valves downstream an example of this is distributed smart manholes to create an in line storage system without need for centralised rtc kändler et al 2020b through distributed measurements acting independently maiolo et al 2020 the distinction of this relative to other internal state measurement controls is the scale at which the synergistic effect of many distributed interventions acting independently can coalesce and the possibility of collecting operational data for offline optimisation however a more powerful tool for urban drainage is the possibility of applying external data for example rainfall forecasts as a predictor for near future system performance at a co ordinated network scale initial deployment of weather data has been focused on prediction rather than actuated control of network features thorndahl and rasmussen 2013 although some models developed auto calibration feedback loops using observed measurements within drainage catchments however modelling studies have now developed proof of concept implementing nowcasting approaches towards actuation and control with rainfall radar being used to control outlets on detention ponds gaborit et al 2013 2016 and multiple actuators on urban drainage systems löwe et al 2016 recent reviews have evidenced strong potential of nowcasting with some limited pilot studies being implemented commercially best practice generally uses 24 hour forecast windows however recent research highlights that extending this window of prediction up to a 7 day forecast delivers enhanced flood mitigation and water regulation benefits xu et al 2021 prompting a need for reliable services to connect weather data and smart control the application of weather predictions alongside rtc can be support stormwater management objectives at building plot or site level and evidence has been identified from a range of industry trials across a number of countries melville shreeve et al 2016 iwra and k water 2018 3 6 decentralised smart stormwater systems the majority of literature describing implementation of smart systems for stormwater management has focused on embedding rtc in large infrastructure systems in many ways this echoes a historic paradigm focused on engineering similar centralised often referred to as grey systems to address water supply treatment and sewerage functions butler et al 2018 over time this has slowly developed from a large asset focus towards maximising network capacity through mobilisation of several to many large assets across the traditional definitions of a sewer network ie pipes cso s and tanks kändler et al 2020a 2020b maiolo et al 2020 in this context rtc has been widely demonstrated to achieve cost effective application for increasing network capacities wang et al 2021 whilst retaining options for future adaption through retrofit or iteration and upgrade of control rules dirckx et al 2011 altobelli et al 2020 however through contemporary advances such as the principles of water sensitive urban design wong and eadie 2000 wong 2006 wong and brown 2009 and novel stormwater interventions fletcher et al 2015 schanze 2017 o donnell et al 2020 oral et al 2020 we now understand that the boundaries of what has historically been considered the stormwater system are far wider than just a sewer network recognition that decentralised distributed and co ordinated application of smart technologies to manage stormwater at this catchment scale have the potential to realise significant future benefits for resilient and sustainable systems butler et al 2014 2017 troutman et al 2020 in 2016 kerkez et al published a review introducing the open storm consortium open storm 2021 working on the potential for advances in low cost sensors and actuators to progress historic static stormwater systems towards dynamically controlled systems benefitting from optimal adaptive control of a mix of centralised grey and distributed green infrastructure translating the iot narrative towards the stormwater community atzori et al 2010 this work recognised the limitations of previous rtc technology in urban drainage restricted to application of large infrastructure and realised the potential of reduced cost and increased adaptive capacity when systems were deployed at a catchment scale riaño briceño et al 2016 the review identified critical knowledge gaps including incomplete application of systems thinking a lack of certainty over new technologies adoption of standards and governance models and cyber security supporting follow up publications developing this knowledge into frameworks have now been completed mullapudi et al 2017 bartos et al 2018 the benefits of smart green infrastructure at a catchment scale are supported throughout literature with municipalities seeing their potential to reduce stormwater hazards but unsure over performance and costs in the long term meng et al 2017 this reluctance is often amplified by a lack of certainty over green infrastructure performance in general brown and farrelly 2009 scholz 2015 o donnell et al 2017 thorne et al 2018 white et al 2018 however a growing body of evidence is emerging to challenge this stigma and set out distributed smart green infrastructure as an alternative and promising solution prominent solutions include attenuation basins and rainwater harvesting tanks xu et al 2021 attenuation basins are storage facilities which capture stormwater during intense events and hold it for later controlled release woods ballard et al 2015 attenuation basins are consistently popular to implement infrastructure due to the possibility for a single intervention to be sized to hold significant quantities of stormwater and the ease of installing a single attenuation intervention to control outlets basins can be implemented as an individual asset simplifying the need for complicated catchment scale coordination gaborit et al 2016 sharior et al 2019 shishegar et al 2019 or implemented as part of a synergistic system of multiple interventions di matteo et al 2019 schmitt et al 2020 recent studies investigating application have found that optimisation of rtc rules across catchments has significant benefits shishegar et al 2021 which can be further accelerated with iot technology enabling effective and near instantaneous communication between centralised control and distributed infrastructure rainwater harvesting tanks operate in a similar way to attenuation basins but are typically smaller so could benefit from distributed deployment across a catchment taking advantage of coordinated regulation communication and security rainwater harvesting involves rainwater capture from a surface typically a roof followed by storage in tanks for later re use as a form of non potable water supply or attenuation through a pipe or infiltration outlet melville shreeve et al 2014 2016 gee and hunt 2016 systems are classified as passive no smart control or active control systems dynamically manage storage volumes melville shreeve et al 2016 parolari et al 2018 literature identifies the potential for these systems to achieve multiple benefits in both stormwater attenuation to protect downstream networks and rainwater re use to supplement existing water supplies campisano et al 2017 xu et al 2018 the dual benefit of which makes these systems an effective target for smart control to optimise asset benefits rohrer and armitage 2017 most effective application of both rainwater harvesting and attenuation basins is deemed to be through development of networks of coordinated systems at a catchment scale kerkez et al 2016 the majority of current coordination is achieved through offline optimisation of each asset s independent performance either through the status of the asset itself mullapudi et al 2018 upstream conditions kändler et al 2020a 2020b lund et al 2020 sadler et al 2020 or forecasting thorndahl and rasmussen 2013 tao et al 2020 research has identified that distributed smart controls system control have substantial benefits even when compared to individual tanks matching the volume of distributed measures di matteo et al 2019 shishegar et al 2019 decentralised control is increasingly perceived as a robust solution due to limited requirement for communication schütze et al 2004 xu et al 2021 and substantial evidence indicating that assets perform to a better standard capturing water in higher magnitude events than passive operation alone bilodeau et al 2018 wong and kerkez 2018 sometimes referred to as sweating the assets yuan et al 2019 most studies to date have focused on this asset scale xu et al 2021 however this misses the benefits of smart coordination across networks troutman et al 2020 leaving a research need for further studies addressing how benefits can be maximised 3 7 best practice and real world examples from literature although the majority of research refers to modelling studies as opposed to practical implementation there are several notable examples of network scale smart stormwater systems in practice including the louisville and jefferson county metropolitan sewer district louisville msd in kentucky tao et al 2020 and the mages system in paris tabuchi et al 2020 the louisville msd was established in 2006 and integrates sewer monitoring data weather forecasting and network scale optimisation to maximise network capacity and treatment inflows the scheme has resulted in a saving of over 200 million in capital costs through maximising network efficiency and reducing the need for stormwater storage facilities as well as reducing operational and environmental costs through reducing sewer overflows by over 2 million gallons per year tao et al 2020 the mages system in paris applies real time monitoring from 2000 sensors combined with a linked model with 23 000 calculation points this information is updated every 5 minutes to provide a near real time representation of current network conditions the system also integrates monitoring with rainfall forecasts to predict future network conditions for up to 24 hours in dry conditions and 6 hours where rain is forecast predictions are then carried forward for calculation and implementation of optimal solutions for current and future conditions tabuchi et al 2020 application of future smart stormwater application is likely to rapidly develop with multiple water and municipal organisations starting to purchase and install large networks of battery operated water level and flow monitors across networks for example southern water uk recently purchasing 30 000 network sensors in part to manage capacity and blockage issues across the combined sewer system southern water 2021 other water companies are undertaking similar work to install monitors highlighting the need for researchers to develop ways to record evaluate and realise the value from these sensors 4 how smart is smart a conceptual framework for benchmarking progress it is apparent that smart stormwater is a rapidly growing topic within literature with many examples of current cutting edge research demonstrating the advantages of adopting smart approaches however terminology and perceptions of what a smart system entails are fragmented with many tangential or incomplete applications labelled as smart stormwater systems to alleviate this we have developed a classification framework to map align and track progress in this field and ensure remaining challenges in research and application are effectively addressed in a systematic and strategic manner we present this framework in fig 3 below 4 1 framework overview our framework maps smart stormwater through from a passive asset which cannot be defined as smart towards increasing levels of smart functionality through incremental fundamental developments in technology and capability fig 3 technology represents the underlying scientific knowledge machinery or equipment required for a particular task whereas capability represents the power or ability that a particular technology affords the relationship between technology and capability is delimited by each technology realising the capability aligned directly below it in the figure for example each technology aligns with a capability and progression of these towards the right degree of functionality iteratively builds the smart functionality of a system for example just installing an asset enables passive operation installing sensing on that asset enables it to operate actively in response to its condition data collection technology enables that data to be used for offline optimisation whereas data communication then enables online control of assets up to networks if appropriate data management is in place finally data analytics and integration enables online multi objective optimisation of a network through this framework we aim to differentiate the degree of smartness for a particular technology and capability fig 3 with the simplest passive operation on the left of the diagram progressing through to connected coordinated and responsive smart stormwater systems on the right the increments towards smart stormwater have been informed by themes drawn from our literature review and through expanding comparable frameworks such as the smart water networks forum swan layers swan 2021 towards stormwater specificity we discuss the significance of each increment within the framework and map existing research to this in the section below 4 2 passive operation of assets passive operation is achieved through day to day operation of the physical elements representing the stormwater network for example suds devices tanks sewers overspills and other green infrastructure butler et al 2018 once installed passive operation is achieved through data less operation of the system this approach is indicative of pre twentieth century technology where assets are designed installed and left to function with any further analysis or maintenance being undertaken manually sporadically and more often than not on a reactive basis this represents the vast majority of existing stormwater networks at a global scale barbosa et al 2012 we note that there is nothing intrinsically wrong with these reliable legacy systems and in many cases these systems are able to effectively and efficiently manage stormwater networks with little intervention as well as providing opportunities for passively achieving multiple benefits when integrated within interventions such as green infrastructure or passive rainwater harvesting fletcher et al 2015 mijic et al 2016 fenner 2017 however this approach cannot be deemed smart and growing awareness of issues with legacy systems marlow et al 2013 butler et al 2017 the rivers trust 2019 has developed a consensus that more effective utilisation of networks using smart technologies is desirable dirckx et al 2011 yuan et al 2019 altobelli et al 2020 4 3 asset sensing and active operation the first and most basic manifestation of a smart stormwater system is the capability for assets to automatically actuate in response to local sensors monitoring their own or nearby network conditions this type of solution is a common and widely implemented strategy and is reported as a form of rtc within literature associated with responsive asset operation this style of control is particularly synonymous with measures designed to enhance inline stormwater storage assets gaborit et al 2013 löwe et al 2016 bilodeau et al 2018 shishegar et al 2019 or valves on combined networks ruggaber et al 2007 most advanced application occurs through deployment across networks kändler et al 2020b schmitt et al 2020 the ease of sensors determining water level means that the majority of implementations are focused on water quantity and implementations which do address water quality issues are typically limited to controlling runoff quantity from high risk sites as opposed to measuring contamination levels campisano et al 2013 however proxy measures such as modelled or indirectly measured suspended solids for example via absorption spectra have become more commonplace in recent years gaborit et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 bachmann machnik et al 2021 with other studies developing promising applications of responsive quality based monitoring as part of green infrastructure shen et al 2020 4 4 data collection and offline optimisation the next level of capability when implementing smart systems arises from data collection this differentiates from sensing through capturing and storing data from previous operations as opposed to purely adjusting performance based on a sensor s current status the main advantage of capturing data over time is in analysing this to develop insight into system operation providing the potential for offline optimisation of adjusting operational rule sets with manual data collection in place for example temperature vibration sensors on pump assets or water level probes in storm tanks it is possible to understand the performance of an asset through subsequent offline appraisal such assessments are familiar with asset and network managers who might routinely undertake regular performance audits in this context with basic asset data collection in place operators can potentially target maintenance to those stormwater assets with anomalous water levels e g those that might have a higher chance of siltation or blockage than other assets or manually and iteratively investigate the effects of applying different rule sets to control basic responsive operation at an asset melville shreeve et al 2014 or network scale bachmann machnik et al 2021 eulogi et al 2021 wang et al 2021 a further advantage with data collection is the ability to validate and test the hydraulic modelling synonymous with the design and operation of stormwater networks pender and neelz 2010 dottori et al 2013 4 5 data communication management and online control a range of wireless communication technologies are now enabling real time and multi directional communication between sensors actuators and centralised control systems enabling data capture in real time as opposed to only collecting retrospective data as discussed above and subsequent remote control historically data communication has been achieved through cellular networks and satellites das and jain 2017 nguyen and phung 2017 sobel et al 2017 however success of these measures has been curtailed by issues of cost battery limitations due to the significant power required for transmission olatinwo and joubert 2019 and the a lack of radio penetration to connect underground sensors with above ground networks lalle et al 2019 this has historically limited communication to below ground infrastructure assets contributing to the previously discussed dominance of centralised monitoring at larger assets in the early adoption of smart systems however the ubiquity of smart sensors across sectors now means a range of low cost energy efficient alternatives are commonplace lalle et al 2021 leading to the potential for widespread deployment at scale deployment of two way communication systems has enabled real time decentralised control of assets and when twinned with data management systems this ability can be upscaled to monitor entire networks this capability is frequently assumed in modelling studies emphasising the potential for smart systems many municipalities and utilities are beginning to develop distributed sensor networks to realise this capability iwra and k water 2018 however although a handful of examples exist tabuchi et al 2020 tao et al 2020 most of these networks are focused on monitoring and have not achieved network scale active control outside of individual assets ibrahim 2020 an opportunity to bridge from an asset scale towards network scale management and control lies in data assimilation hansen et al 2014 hutton et al 2014 palmitessa et al 2021 data assimilation is the process of dynamically estimating the status across different locations in a network through combining modelled and observed data lund et al 2019 this is a pertinent capability in terms of complementing gaps in hardware sensing with many current examples of network monitors relatively sparse advanced implementation of real world and modelled data can be developed towards digital twins digital twins integrate embedded sensing data assimilation and modelling to develop a digital representation of a system in real time bartos and kerkez 2021 within stormwater management a digital twin is likely to include sewer flow sensors coupled to an integrated hydrodynamic model of the stormwater network basic application of this process may be used for real time monitoring of the stormwater system with smarter application of this developing towards control and actuation 4 6 data analytics and online optimisation stormwater data analytics and optimisation is a topic of broad and well developed research often synthesised under the banner of hydroinformatics ellis and marsalek 1996 however with regards to our smart stormwater framework it is apparent that analytics optimisation and learning need to take place in a manner which can actively optimise system operation in real time shishegar et al 2018 although certain studies have demonstrated this level of optimisation on small systems we note that consistent application up to a coordinated catchment scale perspective has not been achieved this is typically due to the limitation of processing time for hydraulic modelling which can be in the order of hours for decisions required in the order of minutes rathnayake and faisal anwar 2019 however we note that new models and increases in computational efficiency are improving the outlook in this regard some limited application of real time optimisation of complex stormwater systems is beginning tabuchi et al 2020 however developing optimisation to the network scale and real time perspective required for coordinated decentralised infrastructure remains a limitation of current approaches schütze et al 2004 xu et al 2021 4 7 data integration and multi functional online optimisation the most advanced degree of smartness in stormwater management is the ability for smart networks to make optimal decisions regarding data from inside the network aligned with data from external sources the most common utilisation of this approach is through current integration with rainfall radar and forecasting gaborit et al 2013 2016 thorndahl and rasmussen 2013 löwe et al 2016 this develops the capability to optimise decisions based for current and future condition of the network as demonstrated in practice in the paris mages system tabuchi et al 2020 this is further advanced through integrating data to expand optimal performance from a focus on hydraulics towards other external additionalities and interactions across subsystems this is most pertinent when considering the potential multiple benefits and cross sector interactions of novel green infrastructures which can be managed to achieve significant benefits to stormwater alongside environmental and societal functions mijic et al 2016 frantzeskaki 2019 o donnell et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 development of smart management across multiple subsystems brings stormwater management towards the smart cities agenda abbas et al 2017 meng et al 2017 4 8 cyber security cyber security is beyond the scope of this review but remains of absolute importance as infrastructure advances from passive operation towards connected and controllable smart stormwater systems which may be vulnerable to malicious or accidental digital threats kerkez et al 2016 we strongly recommend that advances towards smart stormwater take cyber security into account at every stage of implementation and data management to emphasise this risk we highlight several recent cyber attacks on infrastructure the 2021 colonial pipeline ransomware attack which led to cascading and unaccounted damages across the united states bbc 2021 the 2017 notpetya attack which was estimated to cause 850 million in damages including 300 million each to the companies maersk and tnt bbc 2017 and the 2017 wannacry attack which was estimated to cost 8 billion globally including shutting down the systems of 80 uk nhs trusts resulting in the cancellation of 20 000 health appointments reuters 2017 the guardian 2017 water systems have also been targeted with particularly dangerous results when cyber criminals have gained access to control infrastructure an early example of this is the maroochy water system attack in 2000 where a disgruntled ex employee gained control of a water system and discharged over one million litres of sewage into a river and a hotel miller and rowe 2012 however even where physical controls are safeguarded cyber attacks on digital infrastructure such as data management systems can also lead to significant damage lloyds of london estimate that a large to extreme coordinated hacking of cloud systems could result in economic losses of 53 billion with actual losses as high as 121 billion reuters 2017 5 what are the barriers and challenges to advance best practice we have identified several significant barriers and challenges which should be addressed for future research to realise effective smart stormwater management 5 1 technological challenges 5 1 1 specialised technologies from a technological perspective many of the components including sensors actuators and communication technologies are available and reliable when deployed under appropriate management and maintenance regimes campisano et al 2013 in fact many comparable technologies are already ubiquitous across other sectors predominantly energy transport and communication as part of the iot revolution atzori et al 2010 ibm 2016 das and jain 2017 edmondson et al 2018 in this regard we argue that the underlying components of actuation communication security are already available but have not necessarily been combined or translated to provide utility and transferability to the stormwater domain specialist technologies which are specific to the stormwater or water domain are typically less available this includes sensors and actuators which record or control components not directly transferable from other sectors specialist sensors and actuators are available for stormwater quantity control however water quality applications are not at the same maturity level due to challenges in real time data for chemical and biological contaminants campisano et al 2013 furthermore although sensing and actuation technology exists this still needs to be implemented and tested at scale to demonstrate practical effectiveness 5 1 2 computation time and multi functionality a further key technological challenge is the current disconnect between the timescale of optimising complex networks versus the timescale of required action at which network management decisions need to be made in practice modelled strategies which show significant promise ie shishegar et al 2021 require advances in distribution and application of sensor technology atzori et al 2010 as well as modelling and optimisation which can be undertaken at the same timescale as decisions need to be made xu et al 2021 current optimisation and control is achieved through control of small numbers of local scale components kändler et al 2020b or with simple pre defined rules however future research is required to achieve catchment or network wide control of multiple components optimisation and control also requires confidence in data streams particularly when networks are controlled relative to predicted rather than current conditions a key factor with data is accuracy of forecast data particularly when extending timeframes xu et al 2020 while computing power increases consistently over time thus theoretically reducing computation time required to solve optimisation problems the move towards increasingly multi functional stormwater management will dramatically increase computational time through requiring simultaneous modelling and solving trade offs between multiple objectives there are significant advances in developing objective functions for stormwater that simultaneously consider water quality treatment flood mitigation water supply and delivery of more natural streamflow regimes shishegar et al 2019 shen et al 2020 xu et al 2020 similarly there is an increasing trend towards hybrid centralised decentralised systems in both water supply and stormwater liang et al 2019 which are ideal for smart stormwater technology for example jointly optimising the flood mitigation performance of large stormwater retention basins with distributed e g household scale systems that also act as supplementary water supply such an approach dramatically increases the number of control elements in the optimisation with subsequent impacts on computational requirements while increased computational power provides one solution to these challenges there are also promising advances in uses of longer forecast windows xu et al 2020 allowing system operations requiring longer modelling timeframes to be undertaken well in advance of critical events 5 2 socio economic challenges 5 2 1 trust much of the technology underlying smart stormwater systems exists but remains under utilised in practice this highlights that many of the ultimate barriers to implementation remain socio economic a frequently cited barrier to smart stormwater is the lack of trust in novel technologies particularly when viewed in the context of a risk averse water industry kerkez et al 2016 white et al 2018 frantzeskaki 2019 modelling studies routinely demonstrate the benefits of smart distributed systems however future application requires development of demonstrator sites from current ad hoc site scale pilots towards catchment scale implementation ibrahim 2020 trust in whole life costing of systems is also crucial with many municipalities willing to invest more in smart technology if lower over time costs can be achieved meng and hsu 2019 developing demonstrator sites which can evidence technology costs and reliability are a key step in enhancing trust and up scaling implementation will also drive positive feedback loops to enhance economies of scale securing implementation with municipalities and utilities also requires investigation of appropriate business models to drive investment xu et al 2021 investigating business models will benefit from multi disciplinary research to explore the many permutations of centralised decentralised public and private ownership control and incentive relationships which have the potential to spark a step change in water industry culture when describing this step change we envisage potential parallels with approaches used in the energy feed in tariffs and financial bitcoin processing markets where distributed public private models have proved mutually beneficial and replicable at scale issues with trust are also compounded by uncertainty over regulation and ownership of assets regulation regarding smart stormwater is piecemeal at best but consequences for poor water quantity or quality outcomes can be severe evidenced through the recent 126 million fine charged to southern water uk for cso spills smart water systems are likely to alleviate these pressures however clarity over operation and standards is required to ensure utilities are confident deploying them this is particularly crucial where smart systems are network wide and include novel assets such as rainwater harvesting which may be operated by individuals or companies not within the water utility itself hoang and fenner 2015 5 2 2 business cases and business models the advent of smart stormwater technologies opens up new ways of managing stormwater for example flood mitigation can now be provided not only by large infrastructure operators but also by householders with rainwater and stormwater harvesting systems that operate collaboratively with larger downstream storages to mitigate peak flows or shift flow peaks similarly smart stormwater systems have the potential to be operated to improve urban amenity by increasing landscape moisture during critical heat events such services have a market value to consumers creating new business opportunities however for investments in these opportunities to be successful there needs to be an efficient market that allows providers to receive financial benefits for their investments mell 2018 this will require development of new business models which in turn may require regulatory changes to open up currently monopolistic service provision arrangements to a wider range of players doing so however also opens up new opportunities for current water service providers such as in the installation operation and maintenance of decentralised stormwater and water supply infrastructure such as the aquarevo example in australia where south east water joined with a private company to create an urban development offering smart stormwater water supply wastewater and energy provision including ongoing system maintenance and support livesley et al 2021 5 2 3 standards and standardisation similarly standardisation of protocols for data communication and interoperability is required to ensure integration across multiple companies and systems edmondson et al 2018 tabuchi et al 2020 current smart control systems tend to be based on proprietary software architectures and may not be easily migrated into existing management frameworks this is made worse by the rapidly evolving nature of the iot with new sensor communications and data storage technologies developing despite the obvious attractions of such advances these can also act as significant barriers to entry for water agencies and service providers whose scale of deployment requires confidence in the long term operation maintenance and interoperability of installed systems there is thus a need for national and international standards and consistent adoption alignment and adherence to these to provide the industry with the required long term confidence and thus to provide more certain market access for future technological advances 6 conclusions literature almost universally agrees that smart technology is or will be beneficial to stormwater management however studies present disconnected and diverse smart applications which often only partially capture the true potential of this emerging technology effective future research relies on an aligned strategic and consistent direction when evaluating smart stormwater to this end we have evaluated best practice and developed a framework to benchmark progress and highlight next steps despite high availability of components for implementation of smart stormwater approaches across connected sectors the current state of smart stormwater is dominated by proof of concept modelling studies with limited real world application beyond rtc of large assets individual pilots and monitoring and with most applications made to water quantity and not quality challenges future research should advance the degree of smartness and corresponding benefits of smart stormwater through investigating how components can be integrated controlled and optimised across a catchment scale this can be achieved through developing trust in the technology economics and benefits of systems using demonstrator projects and cross sector collaboration and in particular through investigating the integration of stormwater within the smart cities

15950,stormwater hazards are a significant threat across the globe these are continuing to increase in line with urbanisation and climate change leading to a recognition that the historic paradigm of passive management using centralised infrastructure is insufficient to manage future hazards to our society environment and economy the cross sector internet of things revolution has inspired a new generation of smart stormwater management systems which offer an effective cost beneficial and adaptive solution to enhance network capacities and reduce hazards however despite growing prominence within research this technology remains under utilised in a large part due to fragmented and inconsistent alignment and terminology obscuring the strategic co ordination of research we respond to this through systematically reviewing the terminology practice and trajectory for smart stormwater management and developing a framework which can be applied to both coordinate and understand the existing research landscape as well as identifying key research gaps for future development we find that literature almost universally agrees that smart technology is or will be beneficial to stormwater management and that technology has reached partial maturity in terms of quantity management although this has not yet transferred to water quality however research is dominated by proof of concept modelling studies with limited practical application beyond real time control of large assets individual pilot studies and monitoring we recommend that future research explores and evidences the substantial benefits likely through expanding current implementation towards a coordinated decentralised and optimised catchment scale approach graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords active control internet of things iot real time control rtc smart systems smart water management stormwater 1 introduction stormwater hazards created through intense rainfall overwhelming drainage systems generate enormous impacts to our societies environments and economies at a global scale ipcc 2014 defra 2018 historically these hazards have been managed through extensive deployment of passive infrastructure across cities and catchments butler et al 2018 this has been predominantly achieved through implementing subterranean grey infrastructure with a contemporary drive towards increasing application of green infrastructure to extend the scope of stormwater management across catchment surfaces and buildings wong and brown 2009 cettner 2012 fletcher et al 2015 scholz 2015 however current predictions highlight that the scale of stormwater hazards is increasing at a rate far higher than previously anticipated wing et al 2018 swain et al 2020 consequently there is a growing realisation that managing stormwater using passive networks of the twentieth century is insufficient to meet the needs of the future and instead more cost effective adaptable and sustainable use of existing networks can be achieved through deploying smart technology bartos et al 2018 yuan et al 2019 xu et al 2021 the concept of smart stormwater and smart cities has emerged from the cross sector internet of things iot revolution atzori et al 2010 oberascher et al 2022 where cost effective and multi functional sensing communication actuation and optimisation devices installed to monitor control and optimise operation have become ubiquitous across various network infrastructures notably including power and communication systems weiser et al 1999 edmondson et al 2018 translating cross sector advances in iot to achieve smart stormwater management has the potential to enable cost effective management of day to day operations alongside adaptability to reconfigure operation and enhance resilience to manage extreme events mullapudi et al 2017 2018 xu et al 2021 whilst also retaining opportunities for re assessment and upgrade of future operation procedures dirckx et al 2011 altobelli et al 2020 however despite a growing prominence within research the adoption of emerging smart technology remains constrained by several key challenges of pertinence being a fragmented inconsistent and confusing terminology gourbesville 2016 as with other potentially transformative step changes in water management for example resilience davoudi et al 2012 and nature based solutions schanze 2017 there is a real risk that application of the term smart can be constrained as a buzzword with the vernacular applied in a non specific manner to describe a range of tangential applications this is exacerbated by ubiquitous application and claims regarding what smart is creating ambiguity and uncertainty with regards to mapping the overarching progress of where smart stormwater research is now and what the next research steps should be on to a consistent knowledge framework in this review we aim to address these gaps through 1 reviewing smart technology research in the field of stormwater management 2 providing a resource to align terminology 3 mapping research onto a consistent knowledge framework to facilitate clear identification of the progress to date 4 identifying the research gaps and barriers to propose further studies for the systematic and meaningful development of smart stormwater management 2 clarifying the terminology the use of smart technology as a term is ubiquitous across every day discourse science governance and practice although arguably far more so in fields such as energy telecommunications heating cooling and ventilation hvac than in stormwater hydrology and hydraulics while the use of smart technology as a general descriptor has the advantage of attracting interest from decision makers policy makers and even the public fletcher et al 2015 there is a risk that such general terms will lead to confusion about what is actually meant when describing scientific progress and needs clear dissemination of knowledge requires consistent application of terminology such that the audience understands the nature scope and intent of proposed approaches in this review we use a range of terms to describe similar but subtly different applications of smart technology in an attempt to link our discussion to the sources of literature from which it is drawn to avoid confusion we attempt to define the terms we use in the following section we argue that in an evolving field such as this there is a need for authors to clearly define the terms they are using doing so will not only help to ensure clarity of communication within the stormwater discipline but help to open up the discussion to other related disciplines such as system optimisation and control green infrastructure urban planning and even urban ecology smart technology smart technology encapsulates technologies able to sense monitor collect data communicate manage analyse integrate control or optimise devices in a systematic manner this includes both standalone devices with integrated smart features and technologies which can be retrofitted to enhance the capabilities of other devices assets or networks this definition covers a wide range of technologies encapsulating varying degrees of smartness and leading to the fragmented and inconsistent application of smart technologies within current research as such we will develop a framework within this paper to facilitate this range of technologies and capabilities to be benchmarked and compared real time control rtc in terms of stormwater management the term smart is a progression from an established research field in real time control rtc james 1984 kändler et al 2020b sadler et al 2020 xu et al 2021 campisano et al 2013 provide a succinct summary of components and terminology in rtc systems including actuators controllers sensors and telemetry passive active control passive control systems typically rely on hydraulic conditions to alter the discharge rate from a given asset they include orifices vortex flow controls and weirs passive systems might include some degree of smartness if they are monitored e g via telemetry reporting the water level an active control system can permit some form of intervention at an asset typically involving a device such as an actuator the actuator may be driven by local or global control systems active control does not include assets which can control flow velocities using mechanical principles such as vortex flow controls internet of things iot the internet of things describes the interconnection of devices both physical and virtual to the internet and to other connected devices ibm 2016 in the context of smart stormwater this encapsulates all elements of smart technology including hardware and software 3 state of the art 3 1 global literature review we used the terminology identified in our evaluation of what smart stormwater systems are to explore the maturity of existing stormwater literature using a systematic literature review set into three stages our initial stage included conducting a global search of literature based on the scopus indexed research database we searched for all literature which included the keywords smart smarter active control real time control and hyphenated variations thereof or rtc and stormwater or storm water within the title abstract or keywords this search returned 319 documents as of 7th may 2021 we then applied filters to refine our selection to publication in journals as an article or review which resulted in 154 documents and removed any non english documents due to our inability to accurately assess their content in total this process retained 145 documents our final process was a manual review of all remaining abstracts to ensure that the title abstract and key words accurately reflected smart stormwater technology we found that the word smart proved a popular basis for acronyms and as an adjective describing decision making based on non iot linked advances and after discounting these non relevant documents we were left with a collection of 94 documents fig 1 shows the cumulative publication of smart stormwater articles according to our search procedure the earliest recorded article is from 1984 and from there a slow steady rate of publication is apparent through to the late 1990 s with publication accelerating through 2000 2015 and again during the past five years this trend aligns with the growth of articles citing smart technology across all disciplines in the scopus database highlighting the increasing potential of smart systems and their increasing utilisation across disciplines fig 2 which accelerates during the past decade and has more than doubled in the past five years we note that our search terms and procedure will not capture the full range of smart stormwater systems within the global discourse however the scopus database represents a significant proportion of sources with over 75 million records and 23 500 journals from 5 000 publishers scopus 2019 as such this provides a strong indication of publication history to draw general conclusions whilst acknowledging some articles may not have been captured within the search we also note that we have been unable to compare the trajectory of outputs including these terms with the overall number of publications in the scopus database year on year therefore although we identify the increasing use of terms we cannot determine how this increasing prominence relates to the overall increase in papers over the period in our analysis of titles from our literature search we have identified a trajectory of smart stormwater systems with key themes emerging over the past four decades of research this section outlines these key themes and publications our intention of identifying and evaluating these themes is two fold firstly to draw together a comprehensive narrative describing research to date with regards to smart stormwater identifying the state of the art and the state of the possible and secondly using our review to map the future trajectory and research needs to achieve the benefits of smart stormwater for communities and the environment through evaluating research across a consistent theoretical framework in subsequent sections of our paper 3 2 centralised real time control of large infrastructure many early adopters of smart technology applied the term rtc technology to describe controlling assets through actuation in response to sensors with application predominantly driven by cost benefit factors at large infrastructure projects such as sewer trunk mains and reservoirs james 1984 campisano et al 2013 the earliest discussion of smart stormwater found using our search terms was in 1984 where bill james evaluated the use of rtc as an emerging technology to support urban runoff forecasting and reservoir operation james 1984 although this is an example of an early transfer of the rtc approach to stormwater through discussion within the paper it is apparent that james did not coin this term and that the concept of rtc already existed within engineering discourse therefore it is very likely that the concepts of rtc had been discussed significantly prior to this early conversation also commonly took place alongside an evaluation of applying emerging hydraulic modelling software to develop rtc schemes for storm sewer systems clearly highlighting that at the time the essential factor in success was the limitations in accuracy and processing capabilities for running hydraulic modelling cardle 1991 however despite these technical limitations basic implementation on large infrastructure was considered possible from the early 1990 s schilling 1994 and deployment of rtc in sewers continued with case studies developing through literature from the early 1990 s onwards kwan et al 1993 mccann 1993 rtc gradually entered the mainstream scientific consensus regarding best practice for effectively utilising available space in urban drainage systems although was still considered state of the art ellis and marsalek 1996 urban storm drainage 1996 weyand 2002 in the mid 1990 s rtc principles and tools began to enter mainstream products and practice with commercial software such as hydroworks pm being developed and sold to planners and utility providers hayes 1994 examples of implementation from this era are almost exclusively in the control of large infrastructure features including sewer mains and wastewater treatment reflecting limitations in monitoring data computation communication and cost this application to large scale infrastructure remains today with rtc frequently described as a solution to issues of network capacity such as combined sewer overflow cso spills campisano et al 2016 it is worth noting one authors comments regarding this combined sewer overflows which discharge untreated sewage under storm conditions are an old headache for the water industry wyman 1994 a sobering thought given ongoing unprecedented issues and calls to respond to the same challenges almost three decades later the rivers trust 2019 ukwir 2019 3 3 integration towards a network scale in the early 2000 s advances in measurement technology enabled wider monitoring of the stormwater system with multiple sensors throughout networks feeding control data from physical assets including sewers treatment plants and receiving waters schütze et al 2004 however as with previous application the costs uncertainties and limitations in sensor distribution meant that active control remained limited to large strategic assets operated by utility companies the commercial introduction of geographic information systems in the 1990 s presented an opportunity for a wider consideration interpretation and management of geospatial data supporting concepts such as catchment and network management becoming more visual and actionable skop and loaiciga 1998 throughout the 2000 s the scope scale and complexity of what was considered to be the stormwater network began to increase with studies introducing new concepts such as water sensitive urban design wong and eadie 2000 and technologies such as sensor networks fenner 2000 ruggaber et al 2007 and data driven analysis of runoff using rainfall radars vieux and vieux 2005 of pertinence to rtc was the developing implementation of sensors with studies demonstrating sophisticated control using widespread decentralised sensing across sewer infrastructure ruggaber et al 2007 it is around this time that smart began to enter and proliferate through the stormwater vernacular fig 1 much in line with the popularity of this term across scientific literature fig 2 despite the growing prominence of rtc within urban water literature the technology has not yet developed from individual projects to mass application common issues for the lack of implementation were reported including high costs of implementation and uncertainty over operational success schütze et al 2008 working groups such as the german dwa dwa 2005 began to prepare rtc guidelines for sewer systems and reviews indicated the cost effectiveness of installing rtc to manage network capacity whilst also retaining adaptive capacity for later re assessment and upgrade of control measures dirckx et al 2011 altobelli et al 2020 however despite advances implementation remained targeted at the operation of large single infrastructures rather than distributed iot applications 3 4 optimisation of smart systems in parallel with the advancement of network scale monitoring development of optimal real time control strategies was also underway for example using genetic algorithms rauch and harremoës 1999 cembrano et al 2004 rathnayake and faisal anwar 2019 eulogi et al 2021 wang et al 2021 neural networks darsono and labadie 2007 zhang et al 2018 mullapudi et al 2020 saliba et al 2020 and fuzzy logic control li 2020 research in this area has developed with recent reviews by shishegar et al 2018 indicating significant progress across aspects of optimising rtc to achieve effective performance across networks however catchment scale rtc which encapsulates the full range of assets across a network remains a significant challenge to address and even in the modern era many optimisation algorithms are not applied to networks in real time due to computational costs rathnayake and faisal anwar 2019 in particular increasing data and complexity of interconnected systems has yet to take into account feedback loops between multi sector smart system capabilities and operators of such systems at a synergistic city scale jose et al 2015 fenner 2017 meng et al 2017 the majority of optimisation approaches tend towards water quantity flooding cso and network capacity management as opposed to water quality functions campisano et al 2013 this is predominantly because the components needed to monitor quantity have reached a mature stage with sensing actuation and telecommunication technology all reliably available versus water quality technology in particular sensors which are still not at a sufficient reliability or scale of application for real time feedback this is often due to the time lag between water quality samples being taken and then analysed in a lab versus the near instantaneous nature of water level monitoring in recent years proxies such as colour turbidity and dissolved oxygen concentration have been applied to advance this field often feeding forward rtc to control downstream treatment options hoppe et al 2011 lacour and schütze 2011 recent research has also investigated asset scale rtc of green infrastructure to enhance water quality in laboratory environments shen et al 2020 which could be upscaled in future iterations of projects significant sensor networks have begun to be deployed to support the data required for this with examples including large scale demonstrators such as that in lille abbas et al 2017 where a demonstrator representing a town of 25 000 people installed flow and turbidity sensors on wastewater with links to smart city functionality of sewage potable water energy and heat sensors distributed across buildings networks and campus infrastructure however this action remains focused on monitoring data gathering and offline optimisation as opposed to active and responsive real time optimisation and control 3 5 the role of short term forecasting in smart stormwater the most significant progress integrating catchment scale data within smart stormwater has been through integration of weather data and short term forecasting or nowcasting within rtc of networks xu et al 2020 at its simplest level this involves prediction of future network states using rainfall for example to deploy early flood warnings a practice which has existed for a long time plate 2002 yet development of more powerful computational modelling at a price point which enables distribution alongside high resolution input data i e weather radar has now led to integration of rainfall radar in managing large sewer systems iwra and k water 2018 tabuchi et al 2020 this has been developed through two main approaches data gathered from internal sewer network monitoring systems and nowcasting based on external conditions the most straight forward approach is to implement a local active control loop this is achieved through continuous monitoring the internal state of assets or networks linked with automated control to optimise performance one component at a time kändler et al 2020b lund et al 2020 at an asset scale this may include monitoring water levels in tanks or basins melville shreeve et al 2016 parolari et al 2018 or at a network scale this could include monitoring of upstream conditions to regulate flow valves downstream an example of this is distributed smart manholes to create an in line storage system without need for centralised rtc kändler et al 2020b through distributed measurements acting independently maiolo et al 2020 the distinction of this relative to other internal state measurement controls is the scale at which the synergistic effect of many distributed interventions acting independently can coalesce and the possibility of collecting operational data for offline optimisation however a more powerful tool for urban drainage is the possibility of applying external data for example rainfall forecasts as a predictor for near future system performance at a co ordinated network scale initial deployment of weather data has been focused on prediction rather than actuated control of network features thorndahl and rasmussen 2013 although some models developed auto calibration feedback loops using observed measurements within drainage catchments however modelling studies have now developed proof of concept implementing nowcasting approaches towards actuation and control with rainfall radar being used to control outlets on detention ponds gaborit et al 2013 2016 and multiple actuators on urban drainage systems löwe et al 2016 recent reviews have evidenced strong potential of nowcasting with some limited pilot studies being implemented commercially best practice generally uses 24 hour forecast windows however recent research highlights that extending this window of prediction up to a 7 day forecast delivers enhanced flood mitigation and water regulation benefits xu et al 2021 prompting a need for reliable services to connect weather data and smart control the application of weather predictions alongside rtc can be support stormwater management objectives at building plot or site level and evidence has been identified from a range of industry trials across a number of countries melville shreeve et al 2016 iwra and k water 2018 3 6 decentralised smart stormwater systems the majority of literature describing implementation of smart systems for stormwater management has focused on embedding rtc in large infrastructure systems in many ways this echoes a historic paradigm focused on engineering similar centralised often referred to as grey systems to address water supply treatment and sewerage functions butler et al 2018 over time this has slowly developed from a large asset focus towards maximising network capacity through mobilisation of several to many large assets across the traditional definitions of a sewer network ie pipes cso s and tanks kändler et al 2020a 2020b maiolo et al 2020 in this context rtc has been widely demonstrated to achieve cost effective application for increasing network capacities wang et al 2021 whilst retaining options for future adaption through retrofit or iteration and upgrade of control rules dirckx et al 2011 altobelli et al 2020 however through contemporary advances such as the principles of water sensitive urban design wong and eadie 2000 wong 2006 wong and brown 2009 and novel stormwater interventions fletcher et al 2015 schanze 2017 o donnell et al 2020 oral et al 2020 we now understand that the boundaries of what has historically been considered the stormwater system are far wider than just a sewer network recognition that decentralised distributed and co ordinated application of smart technologies to manage stormwater at this catchment scale have the potential to realise significant future benefits for resilient and sustainable systems butler et al 2014 2017 troutman et al 2020 in 2016 kerkez et al published a review introducing the open storm consortium open storm 2021 working on the potential for advances in low cost sensors and actuators to progress historic static stormwater systems towards dynamically controlled systems benefitting from optimal adaptive control of a mix of centralised grey and distributed green infrastructure translating the iot narrative towards the stormwater community atzori et al 2010 this work recognised the limitations of previous rtc technology in urban drainage restricted to application of large infrastructure and realised the potential of reduced cost and increased adaptive capacity when systems were deployed at a catchment scale riaño briceño et al 2016 the review identified critical knowledge gaps including incomplete application of systems thinking a lack of certainty over new technologies adoption of standards and governance models and cyber security supporting follow up publications developing this knowledge into frameworks have now been completed mullapudi et al 2017 bartos et al 2018 the benefits of smart green infrastructure at a catchment scale are supported throughout literature with municipalities seeing their potential to reduce stormwater hazards but unsure over performance and costs in the long term meng et al 2017 this reluctance is often amplified by a lack of certainty over green infrastructure performance in general brown and farrelly 2009 scholz 2015 o donnell et al 2017 thorne et al 2018 white et al 2018 however a growing body of evidence is emerging to challenge this stigma and set out distributed smart green infrastructure as an alternative and promising solution prominent solutions include attenuation basins and rainwater harvesting tanks xu et al 2021 attenuation basins are storage facilities which capture stormwater during intense events and hold it for later controlled release woods ballard et al 2015 attenuation basins are consistently popular to implement infrastructure due to the possibility for a single intervention to be sized to hold significant quantities of stormwater and the ease of installing a single attenuation intervention to control outlets basins can be implemented as an individual asset simplifying the need for complicated catchment scale coordination gaborit et al 2016 sharior et al 2019 shishegar et al 2019 or implemented as part of a synergistic system of multiple interventions di matteo et al 2019 schmitt et al 2020 recent studies investigating application have found that optimisation of rtc rules across catchments has significant benefits shishegar et al 2021 which can be further accelerated with iot technology enabling effective and near instantaneous communication between centralised control and distributed infrastructure rainwater harvesting tanks operate in a similar way to attenuation basins but are typically smaller so could benefit from distributed deployment across a catchment taking advantage of coordinated regulation communication and security rainwater harvesting involves rainwater capture from a surface typically a roof followed by storage in tanks for later re use as a form of non potable water supply or attenuation through a pipe or infiltration outlet melville shreeve et al 2014 2016 gee and hunt 2016 systems are classified as passive no smart control or active control systems dynamically manage storage volumes melville shreeve et al 2016 parolari et al 2018 literature identifies the potential for these systems to achieve multiple benefits in both stormwater attenuation to protect downstream networks and rainwater re use to supplement existing water supplies campisano et al 2017 xu et al 2018 the dual benefit of which makes these systems an effective target for smart control to optimise asset benefits rohrer and armitage 2017 most effective application of both rainwater harvesting and attenuation basins is deemed to be through development of networks of coordinated systems at a catchment scale kerkez et al 2016 the majority of current coordination is achieved through offline optimisation of each asset s independent performance either through the status of the asset itself mullapudi et al 2018 upstream conditions kändler et al 2020a 2020b lund et al 2020 sadler et al 2020 or forecasting thorndahl and rasmussen 2013 tao et al 2020 research has identified that distributed smart controls system control have substantial benefits even when compared to individual tanks matching the volume of distributed measures di matteo et al 2019 shishegar et al 2019 decentralised control is increasingly perceived as a robust solution due to limited requirement for communication schütze et al 2004 xu et al 2021 and substantial evidence indicating that assets perform to a better standard capturing water in higher magnitude events than passive operation alone bilodeau et al 2018 wong and kerkez 2018 sometimes referred to as sweating the assets yuan et al 2019 most studies to date have focused on this asset scale xu et al 2021 however this misses the benefits of smart coordination across networks troutman et al 2020 leaving a research need for further studies addressing how benefits can be maximised 3 7 best practice and real world examples from literature although the majority of research refers to modelling studies as opposed to practical implementation there are several notable examples of network scale smart stormwater systems in practice including the louisville and jefferson county metropolitan sewer district louisville msd in kentucky tao et al 2020 and the mages system in paris tabuchi et al 2020 the louisville msd was established in 2006 and integrates sewer monitoring data weather forecasting and network scale optimisation to maximise network capacity and treatment inflows the scheme has resulted in a saving of over 200 million in capital costs through maximising network efficiency and reducing the need for stormwater storage facilities as well as reducing operational and environmental costs through reducing sewer overflows by over 2 million gallons per year tao et al 2020 the mages system in paris applies real time monitoring from 2000 sensors combined with a linked model with 23 000 calculation points this information is updated every 5 minutes to provide a near real time representation of current network conditions the system also integrates monitoring with rainfall forecasts to predict future network conditions for up to 24 hours in dry conditions and 6 hours where rain is forecast predictions are then carried forward for calculation and implementation of optimal solutions for current and future conditions tabuchi et al 2020 application of future smart stormwater application is likely to rapidly develop with multiple water and municipal organisations starting to purchase and install large networks of battery operated water level and flow monitors across networks for example southern water uk recently purchasing 30 000 network sensors in part to manage capacity and blockage issues across the combined sewer system southern water 2021 other water companies are undertaking similar work to install monitors highlighting the need for researchers to develop ways to record evaluate and realise the value from these sensors 4 how smart is smart a conceptual framework for benchmarking progress it is apparent that smart stormwater is a rapidly growing topic within literature with many examples of current cutting edge research demonstrating the advantages of adopting smart approaches however terminology and perceptions of what a smart system entails are fragmented with many tangential or incomplete applications labelled as smart stormwater systems to alleviate this we have developed a classification framework to map align and track progress in this field and ensure remaining challenges in research and application are effectively addressed in a systematic and strategic manner we present this framework in fig 3 below 4 1 framework overview our framework maps smart stormwater through from a passive asset which cannot be defined as smart towards increasing levels of smart functionality through incremental fundamental developments in technology and capability fig 3 technology represents the underlying scientific knowledge machinery or equipment required for a particular task whereas capability represents the power or ability that a particular technology affords the relationship between technology and capability is delimited by each technology realising the capability aligned directly below it in the figure for example each technology aligns with a capability and progression of these towards the right degree of functionality iteratively builds the smart functionality of a system for example just installing an asset enables passive operation installing sensing on that asset enables it to operate actively in response to its condition data collection technology enables that data to be used for offline optimisation whereas data communication then enables online control of assets up to networks if appropriate data management is in place finally data analytics and integration enables online multi objective optimisation of a network through this framework we aim to differentiate the degree of smartness for a particular technology and capability fig 3 with the simplest passive operation on the left of the diagram progressing through to connected coordinated and responsive smart stormwater systems on the right the increments towards smart stormwater have been informed by themes drawn from our literature review and through expanding comparable frameworks such as the smart water networks forum swan layers swan 2021 towards stormwater specificity we discuss the significance of each increment within the framework and map existing research to this in the section below 4 2 passive operation of assets passive operation is achieved through day to day operation of the physical elements representing the stormwater network for example suds devices tanks sewers overspills and other green infrastructure butler et al 2018 once installed passive operation is achieved through data less operation of the system this approach is indicative of pre twentieth century technology where assets are designed installed and left to function with any further analysis or maintenance being undertaken manually sporadically and more often than not on a reactive basis this represents the vast majority of existing stormwater networks at a global scale barbosa et al 2012 we note that there is nothing intrinsically wrong with these reliable legacy systems and in many cases these systems are able to effectively and efficiently manage stormwater networks with little intervention as well as providing opportunities for passively achieving multiple benefits when integrated within interventions such as green infrastructure or passive rainwater harvesting fletcher et al 2015 mijic et al 2016 fenner 2017 however this approach cannot be deemed smart and growing awareness of issues with legacy systems marlow et al 2013 butler et al 2017 the rivers trust 2019 has developed a consensus that more effective utilisation of networks using smart technologies is desirable dirckx et al 2011 yuan et al 2019 altobelli et al 2020 4 3 asset sensing and active operation the first and most basic manifestation of a smart stormwater system is the capability for assets to automatically actuate in response to local sensors monitoring their own or nearby network conditions this type of solution is a common and widely implemented strategy and is reported as a form of rtc within literature associated with responsive asset operation this style of control is particularly synonymous with measures designed to enhance inline stormwater storage assets gaborit et al 2013 löwe et al 2016 bilodeau et al 2018 shishegar et al 2019 or valves on combined networks ruggaber et al 2007 most advanced application occurs through deployment across networks kändler et al 2020b schmitt et al 2020 the ease of sensors determining water level means that the majority of implementations are focused on water quantity and implementations which do address water quality issues are typically limited to controlling runoff quantity from high risk sites as opposed to measuring contamination levels campisano et al 2013 however proxy measures such as modelled or indirectly measured suspended solids for example via absorption spectra have become more commonplace in recent years gaborit et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 bachmann machnik et al 2021 with other studies developing promising applications of responsive quality based monitoring as part of green infrastructure shen et al 2020 4 4 data collection and offline optimisation the next level of capability when implementing smart systems arises from data collection this differentiates from sensing through capturing and storing data from previous operations as opposed to purely adjusting performance based on a sensor s current status the main advantage of capturing data over time is in analysing this to develop insight into system operation providing the potential for offline optimisation of adjusting operational rule sets with manual data collection in place for example temperature vibration sensors on pump assets or water level probes in storm tanks it is possible to understand the performance of an asset through subsequent offline appraisal such assessments are familiar with asset and network managers who might routinely undertake regular performance audits in this context with basic asset data collection in place operators can potentially target maintenance to those stormwater assets with anomalous water levels e g those that might have a higher chance of siltation or blockage than other assets or manually and iteratively investigate the effects of applying different rule sets to control basic responsive operation at an asset melville shreeve et al 2014 or network scale bachmann machnik et al 2021 eulogi et al 2021 wang et al 2021 a further advantage with data collection is the ability to validate and test the hydraulic modelling synonymous with the design and operation of stormwater networks pender and neelz 2010 dottori et al 2013 4 5 data communication management and online control a range of wireless communication technologies are now enabling real time and multi directional communication between sensors actuators and centralised control systems enabling data capture in real time as opposed to only collecting retrospective data as discussed above and subsequent remote control historically data communication has been achieved through cellular networks and satellites das and jain 2017 nguyen and phung 2017 sobel et al 2017 however success of these measures has been curtailed by issues of cost battery limitations due to the significant power required for transmission olatinwo and joubert 2019 and the a lack of radio penetration to connect underground sensors with above ground networks lalle et al 2019 this has historically limited communication to below ground infrastructure assets contributing to the previously discussed dominance of centralised monitoring at larger assets in the early adoption of smart systems however the ubiquity of smart sensors across sectors now means a range of low cost energy efficient alternatives are commonplace lalle et al 2021 leading to the potential for widespread deployment at scale deployment of two way communication systems has enabled real time decentralised control of assets and when twinned with data management systems this ability can be upscaled to monitor entire networks this capability is frequently assumed in modelling studies emphasising the potential for smart systems many municipalities and utilities are beginning to develop distributed sensor networks to realise this capability iwra and k water 2018 however although a handful of examples exist tabuchi et al 2020 tao et al 2020 most of these networks are focused on monitoring and have not achieved network scale active control outside of individual assets ibrahim 2020 an opportunity to bridge from an asset scale towards network scale management and control lies in data assimilation hansen et al 2014 hutton et al 2014 palmitessa et al 2021 data assimilation is the process of dynamically estimating the status across different locations in a network through combining modelled and observed data lund et al 2019 this is a pertinent capability in terms of complementing gaps in hardware sensing with many current examples of network monitors relatively sparse advanced implementation of real world and modelled data can be developed towards digital twins digital twins integrate embedded sensing data assimilation and modelling to develop a digital representation of a system in real time bartos and kerkez 2021 within stormwater management a digital twin is likely to include sewer flow sensors coupled to an integrated hydrodynamic model of the stormwater network basic application of this process may be used for real time monitoring of the stormwater system with smarter application of this developing towards control and actuation 4 6 data analytics and online optimisation stormwater data analytics and optimisation is a topic of broad and well developed research often synthesised under the banner of hydroinformatics ellis and marsalek 1996 however with regards to our smart stormwater framework it is apparent that analytics optimisation and learning need to take place in a manner which can actively optimise system operation in real time shishegar et al 2018 although certain studies have demonstrated this level of optimisation on small systems we note that consistent application up to a coordinated catchment scale perspective has not been achieved this is typically due to the limitation of processing time for hydraulic modelling which can be in the order of hours for decisions required in the order of minutes rathnayake and faisal anwar 2019 however we note that new models and increases in computational efficiency are improving the outlook in this regard some limited application of real time optimisation of complex stormwater systems is beginning tabuchi et al 2020 however developing optimisation to the network scale and real time perspective required for coordinated decentralised infrastructure remains a limitation of current approaches schütze et al 2004 xu et al 2021 4 7 data integration and multi functional online optimisation the most advanced degree of smartness in stormwater management is the ability for smart networks to make optimal decisions regarding data from inside the network aligned with data from external sources the most common utilisation of this approach is through current integration with rainfall radar and forecasting gaborit et al 2013 2016 thorndahl and rasmussen 2013 löwe et al 2016 this develops the capability to optimise decisions based for current and future condition of the network as demonstrated in practice in the paris mages system tabuchi et al 2020 this is further advanced through integrating data to expand optimal performance from a focus on hydraulics towards other external additionalities and interactions across subsystems this is most pertinent when considering the potential multiple benefits and cross sector interactions of novel green infrastructures which can be managed to achieve significant benefits to stormwater alongside environmental and societal functions mijic et al 2016 frantzeskaki 2019 o donnell et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 development of smart management across multiple subsystems brings stormwater management towards the smart cities agenda abbas et al 2017 meng et al 2017 4 8 cyber security cyber security is beyond the scope of this review but remains of absolute importance as infrastructure advances from passive operation towards connected and controllable smart stormwater systems which may be vulnerable to malicious or accidental digital threats kerkez et al 2016 we strongly recommend that advances towards smart stormwater take cyber security into account at every stage of implementation and data management to emphasise this risk we highlight several recent cyber attacks on infrastructure the 2021 colonial pipeline ransomware attack which led to cascading and unaccounted damages across the united states bbc 2021 the 2017 notpetya attack which was estimated to cause 850 million in damages including 300 million each to the companies maersk and tnt bbc 2017 and the 2017 wannacry attack which was estimated to cost 8 billion globally including shutting down the systems of 80 uk nhs trusts resulting in the cancellation of 20 000 health appointments reuters 2017 the guardian 2017 water systems have also been targeted with particularly dangerous results when cyber criminals have gained access to control infrastructure an early example of this is the maroochy water system attack in 2000 where a disgruntled ex employee gained control of a water system and discharged over one million litres of sewage into a river and a hotel miller and rowe 2012 however even where physical controls are safeguarded cyber attacks on digital infrastructure such as data management systems can also lead to significant damage lloyds of london estimate that a large to extreme coordinated hacking of cloud systems could result in economic losses of 53 billion with actual losses as high as 121 billion reuters 2017 5 what are the barriers and challenges to advance best practice we have identified several significant barriers and challenges which should be addressed for future research to realise effective smart stormwater management 5 1 technological challenges 5 1 1 specialised technologies from a technological perspective many of the components including sensors actuators and communication technologies are available and reliable when deployed under appropriate management and maintenance regimes campisano et al 2013 in fact many comparable technologies are already ubiquitous across other sectors predominantly energy transport and communication as part of the iot revolution atzori et al 2010 ibm 2016 das and jain 2017 edmondson et al 2018 in this regard we argue that the underlying components of actuation communication security are already available but have not necessarily been combined or translated to provide utility and transferability to the stormwater domain specialist technologies which are specific to the stormwater or water domain are typically less available this includes sensors and actuators which record or control components not directly transferable from other sectors specialist sensors and actuators are available for stormwater quantity control however water quality applications are not at the same maturity level due to challenges in real time data for chemical and biological contaminants campisano et al 2013 furthermore although sensing and actuation technology exists this still needs to be implemented and tested at scale to demonstrate practical effectiveness 5 1 2 computation time and multi functionality a further key technological challenge is the current disconnect between the timescale of optimising complex networks versus the timescale of required action at which network management decisions need to be made in practice modelled strategies which show significant promise ie shishegar et al 2021 require advances in distribution and application of sensor technology atzori et al 2010 as well as modelling and optimisation which can be undertaken at the same timescale as decisions need to be made xu et al 2021 current optimisation and control is achieved through control of small numbers of local scale components kändler et al 2020b or with simple pre defined rules however future research is required to achieve catchment or network wide control of multiple components optimisation and control also requires confidence in data streams particularly when networks are controlled relative to predicted rather than current conditions a key factor with data is accuracy of forecast data particularly when extending timeframes xu et al 2020 while computing power increases consistently over time thus theoretically reducing computation time required to solve optimisation problems the move towards increasingly multi functional stormwater management will dramatically increase computational time through requiring simultaneous modelling and solving trade offs between multiple objectives there are significant advances in developing objective functions for stormwater that simultaneously consider water quality treatment flood mitigation water supply and delivery of more natural streamflow regimes shishegar et al 2019 shen et al 2020 xu et al 2020 similarly there is an increasing trend towards hybrid centralised decentralised systems in both water supply and stormwater liang et al 2019 which are ideal for smart stormwater technology for example jointly optimising the flood mitigation performance of large stormwater retention basins with distributed e g household scale systems that also act as supplementary water supply such an approach dramatically increases the number of control elements in the optimisation with subsequent impacts on computational requirements while increased computational power provides one solution to these challenges there are also promising advances in uses of longer forecast windows xu et al 2020 allowing system operations requiring longer modelling timeframes to be undertaken well in advance of critical events 5 2 socio economic challenges 5 2 1 trust much of the technology underlying smart stormwater systems exists but remains under utilised in practice this highlights that many of the ultimate barriers to implementation remain socio economic a frequently cited barrier to smart stormwater is the lack of trust in novel technologies particularly when viewed in the context of a risk averse water industry kerkez et al 2016 white et al 2018 frantzeskaki 2019 modelling studies routinely demonstrate the benefits of smart distributed systems however future application requires development of demonstrator sites from current ad hoc site scale pilots towards catchment scale implementation ibrahim 2020 trust in whole life costing of systems is also crucial with many municipalities willing to invest more in smart technology if lower over time costs can be achieved meng and hsu 2019 developing demonstrator sites which can evidence technology costs and reliability are a key step in enhancing trust and up scaling implementation will also drive positive feedback loops to enhance economies of scale securing implementation with municipalities and utilities also requires investigation of appropriate business models to drive investment xu et al 2021 investigating business models will benefit from multi disciplinary research to explore the many permutations of centralised decentralised public and private ownership control and incentive relationships which have the potential to spark a step change in water industry culture when describing this step change we envisage potential parallels with approaches used in the energy feed in tariffs and financial bitcoin processing markets where distributed public private models have proved mutually beneficial and replicable at scale issues with trust are also compounded by uncertainty over regulation and ownership of assets regulation regarding smart stormwater is piecemeal at best but consequences for poor water quantity or quality outcomes can be severe evidenced through the recent 126 million fine charged to southern water uk for cso spills smart water systems are likely to alleviate these pressures however clarity over operation and standards is required to ensure utilities are confident deploying them this is particularly crucial where smart systems are network wide and include novel assets such as rainwater harvesting which may be operated by individuals or companies not within the water utility itself hoang and fenner 2015 5 2 2 business cases and business models the advent of smart stormwater technologies opens up new ways of managing stormwater for example flood mitigation can now be provided not only by large infrastructure operators but also by householders with rainwater and stormwater harvesting systems that operate collaboratively with larger downstream storages to mitigate peak flows or shift flow peaks similarly smart stormwater systems have the potential to be operated to improve urban amenity by increasing landscape moisture during critical heat events such services have a market value to consumers creating new business opportunities however for investments in these opportunities to be successful there needs to be an efficient market that allows providers to receive financial benefits for their investments mell 2018 this will require development of new business models which in turn may require regulatory changes to open up currently monopolistic service provision arrangements to a wider range of players doing so however also opens up new opportunities for current water service providers such as in the installation operation and maintenance of decentralised stormwater and water supply infrastructure such as the aquarevo example in australia where south east water joined with a private company to create an urban development offering smart stormwater water supply wastewater and energy provision including ongoing system maintenance and support livesley et al 2021 5 2 3 standards and standardisation similarly standardisation of protocols for data communication and interoperability is required to ensure integration across multiple companies and systems edmondson et al 2018 tabuchi et al 2020 current smart control systems tend to be based on proprietary software architectures and may not be easily migrated into existing management frameworks this is made worse by the rapidly evolving nature of the iot with new sensor communications and data storage technologies developing despite the obvious attractions of such advances these can also act as significant barriers to entry for water agencies and service providers whose scale of deployment requires confidence in the long term operation maintenance and interoperability of installed systems there is thus a need for national and international standards and consistent adoption alignment and adherence to these to provide the industry with the required long term confidence and thus to provide more certain market access for future technological advances 6 conclusions literature almost universally agrees that smart technology is or will be beneficial to stormwater management however studies present disconnected and diverse smart applications which often only partially capture the true potential of this emerging technology effective future research relies on an aligned strategic and consistent direction when evaluating smart stormwater to this end we have evaluated best practice and developed a framework to benchmark progress and highlight next steps despite high availability of components for implementation of smart stormwater approaches across connected sectors the current state of smart stormwater is dominated by proof of concept modelling studies with limited real world application beyond rtc of large assets individual pilots and monitoring and with most applications made to water quantity and not quality challenges future research should advance the degree of smartness and corresponding benefits of smart stormwater through investigating how components can be integrated controlled and optimised across a catchment scale this can be achieved through developing trust in the technology economics and benefits of systems using demonstrator projects and cross sector collaboration and in particular through investigating the integration of stormwater within the smart cities

15951,the increasing amount of sewage sludge produced in wastewater treatment plants wwtps poses a great challenge to both environment and economy globally as a requisite process during sludge treatment sludge dewatering can significantly minimize the sludge volume and lower the operational cost for downstream transportation and disposal iron based advanced oxidation process aop a robust and cost effective technique with relatively low technical barriers for high level sludge dewatering has been widely explored in the past 20 years the development was mainly driven by the demands of efficient and sustainable sludge conditioning technology and the flexible sludge management approaches the application of iron based aops in sludge dewatering process attracts more and more attention in this work we discussed the current application of iron based aops technology in the sludge dewatering processes in a holistic manner summarized the factors affecting the sludge dewaterability in the treatment processes and analyzed the mechanisms of iron based aops to improve dewatering processes furthermore we elaborated potential advantages limitations and challenges associated with implementing iron based aops in the full scale plants and shared the opportunities for sludge reutilization this review aims to contribute to the development of highly efficient iron based aops for

the most common technology in wastewater treatment plants wwtps christensen et al 2015 gherghel et al 2019 wu et al 2020a with the rapid industrialization and urbanization excessive sludge from the process is becoming one of the inevitable challenges to the wwtps and local government schnell et al 2020 it has been estimated that the annual production of sewage sludge in european union was more than 13 0 million ton dry solids ds in 2020 kominko et al 2017 in united states approximately 17 8 million ton of sewage sludge ds is generated from wwtps annually epa 2018 about 0 4 million ton ds of sewage sludge can be produced in australia and new zealand each year drechsel et al 2015 the annual sewage sludge production in china had risen to 13 3 million ton ds in 2020 mohurd 2020 if not being appropriately managed such a large quantity of sewage sludge would pose serious secondary pollution in the worldwide environment cao et al 2021 dewatering as a vital step of sludge treatment can favorably minimize the volume of sludge reduce the operational cost of downstream transportation and disposal and lighten the environmental burden kim et al 2016 yu et al 2016 nevertheless given the high physicochemical binding force between sludge and water it is challenging to separate water from sludge efficiently christensen et al 2015 tremendous efforts have been paid to improve sludge dewaterability through modifying the properties of hydrophilic extracellular polymeric substances eps and destructing the physicochemical binding force between sludge and water xiao et al 2017b yu et al 2021a and b recently advanced oxidation processes aops a promising alternative to conventional coagulation has gained increasing popularity in sludge dewatering process zhen et al 2018 li et al 2019a and 2020a liang et al 2020a and b among various aops the iron based aops attract more and more attention due to its excellent performance in sludge deep dewatering moisture content of sludge 60 wt liu et al 2013a zhang et al 2015 liang et al 2015 yu et al 2016 and 2019a li et al 2020a fig 1 shows the current trend in research publications associated with iron based aops on sludge dewatering in recent five years a rapid upward trend of the relevant publications denotes that the iron based aops become increasingly popular over the past few years some excellent reviews related to sludge dewaterability using different conditioning methods have been published zhou et al 2014a guan et al 2018 liu et al 2018 wei et al 2018 wu et al 2020a cao et al 2021 for example guan et al 2018 summarized the application of h2o2 based aop for sludge dewatering and liu et al 2018 provided a comprehensive overview of so 4 based aop very recently wu et al 2020a and cao et al 2021 analyzed some previously used sludge dewatering technologies and discussed the challenges of various dewatering technologies on subsequent sludge utilization although several reviews have been published previously most of them focused on the comparison of different dewatering technologies e g chemical treatment biological treatment and physical treatment recently iron based aops have seen increasing interest as a promising and efficient dewatering method liu et al 2013a zhang et al 2015 liang et al 2015 however the application of iron based aops on sludge dewatering has never been holistically analyzed so far the mechanisms of iron based aops for sludge dewatering have only been uncovered in recent studies the in depth discussion on the performance factors and the dewatering mechanisms is far scarce additionally the feasibility of reusing treated sludge is unknown thus more attention should be paid to the limitations and challenges of the iron based aops in the sludge conditioning and dewatering processes therefore this work aims to offer a holistic picture of current iron based aops technology for the sludge dewatering with the comprehensive comparison of their advantages and disadvantages it provides the fundamental knowledge of sludge properties and explains the theory of various iron based aops applied in sludge dewatering processes the mechanisms of iron based aops are discussed and the challenges of implementing iron based aops in a large scale application are also highlighted lastly we evaluate the sludge reutilization approaches and propose potential future research directions overall we hope that this review will be equally useful to promote the development of efficient and eco friendly dewatering technology 2 fundamentals of sludge dewatering process 2 1 sludge dewatering barriers sludge including primary sludge activated sludge anaerobic digestion ad sludge and mixed sludge is a semi solid by product from the conventional wwtps sludge flocs has a gel like structure that can host these compounds together via derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo force e g van der waals force wa and electrostatic interaction wr hydrophilic and hydrophobic forces and physical binding force christensen et al 2015 the existence of multiple interaction forces in the flocs would further exacerbate the barriers of separating liquid from sludge solids yu et al 2021a hence more effort is imperative to understand the compositions and characteristics of sludge which may contribute to solve the black box of sludge dewatering generally eps content bound water surface charge particle size and rheological properties are the major parameters reflecting the properties of sludge flocs higgins et al 2004 sheng et al 2010 wu et al 2020a their correlation with the dewaterability of sludge has been well documented zhang et al 2016a xiao et al 2017a li et al 2020a yu et al 2021a and b the main results are summarized as follows 2 1 1 eps eps is a complex macromolecular product from dissolved cell surface matters active secretion and cell lysis it accounts for 70 of the total organic fraction of flocs liu and fang 2003 and occupies both outside of microbial cells and inside of microbial aggregates fig 2 a sheng et al 2010 yu 2020a eps forms a stable net like structure that prevents water escaping from the sludge flocs exhibiting a significant influence on the physicochemical characteristics of sludge flocs such as flocculation settleability and dewaterability neyens et al 2004 d abzac et al 2010 christensen et al 2015 wei et al 2018 li et al 2020a wu et al 2020a over the past two decades tremendous efforts have been focused on the in depth understanding of the relationship between sludge dewaterability and eps it was found out that the eps contents significantly affected the sludge dewaterability and had a positive correlation with sludge dewaterability neyens et al 2004 zhen et al 2012 according to the stratification theory and the shear sensitive characteristics of eps eps from the sludge was divided into three layers namely soluble eps s eps loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps yu et al 2008 and 2010 zhen et al 2013 chen et al 2016a zhang et al 2017a due to the distinguishingly different characteristics of the three eps layers their respective effects on the sludge dewaterability are receiving even more attention chen et al 2016a found that the content of s eps was the main factor affecting sludge dewaterability during calcium peroxide cao2 treatment notwithstanding xiao et al 2017a investigated 20 different types of sludge with various pre treatments and concluded that lb eps played a more considerable role in the sludge dewaterability and filterability compared to s eps and tb eps zhang et al 2022 highlighted that the reduction of tb eps facilitated to the destruction of stable water binding structure of flocs thus resulting in better sludge dewaterability recent studies further investigated the influence of the compositions and functional groups of eps on the sludge dewaterability fig 2b zhen et al 2012 and zhang et al 2016a found that protein like substances in eps were the key determining factor on the sludge dewaterability in the iron based aops treatment via using a three dimensional excitation emission matrix eem xiao et al 2018 and liang et al 2019a found that the water affinity of sludge was determined by the hydrophilic functional groups in eps e g α helix β sheet and random coil in protein secondary structure as well as the n containing functional groups through using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps in the recent study xiao et al 2017b and maqbool et al 2019 used size exclusion chromatography organic carbon detection organic nitrogen detection lc ocd ond to zoom in the predominant components of eps that affect sludge dewaterability results revealed that high contents of low molecular weight lmw proteins and humic substances were associated with low sludge dewaterability notably wu et al 2017 and zhu et al 2020 indicated that tryptophan and lysine in protein could efficiently bind water by the proteomics test furthermore in situ technologies e g scanning electron microscopy sem and confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm were used to analyze the eps morphology xiao et al 2017b xu et al 2018 zhu et al 2020 more recently zhu et al 2020 and xiao et al 2021a found that glycine serine and threonine were the key amino acids worsening sludge dewaterability by adopting high performance liquid chromatography hplc wu et al 2021a and wu et al 2021b analyzed the interactions between water occurrence states and eps and concluded that coagulation treatment could remarkably reduce adherence and viscoelastic properties of eps thus weakening water holding capacity of eps ge et al 2022 and wu et al 2022 applied fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectroscopy ft icr ms to explore the molecular fingerprints of eps results indicated that decomposition of the unsaturated structure units e g cho containing compounds of eps was the key to enhance sludge dewaterability taken together the contents stratifications compositions and functional groups of eps have all been evaluated and correlated with sludge dewaterability although some progress has been made eps is still like a black box that requires in depth understanding in order to fully reveal its relationship with the sludge dewaterability in particular hydrophilic hydrophobic components in the eps and molecular structure of eps associated with the sludge dewaterability should be thoroughly investigated advanced analytical techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy nmr gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms surface enhanced raman spectroscopy and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation qcm d can be employed to unveil more details in the future fig 2b 2 1 2 bound water the moisture content in sludge could be as high as 99 wt vesilind 1994 bound water only accounts for 10 of the total water content in sludge but it cannot be easily removed through mechanical dewatering because of its strongest binding force to sludge flocs wu et al 2020a cao et al 2021 as such the removal of bound water content is considered as the critical step to enhance the solid liquid separation efficiency of sludge recent research has been focused on how to use chemical treatments to improve the bound water removal li et al 2019a found that the bound water content decreased from 2 5 g g total suspended solid tss to 1 9 g g tss after treatment by zero valent iron fe0 combined with persulfate accordingly the sludge dewaterability was significantly promoted as indicated by the greatly reduced moisture content in addition to the above treatments other treatments including in situ crystallization treatment dai et al 2018 thermal treatment zhang et al 2017b ultrasonic treatment zhu et al 2018 and enzymatic lysis treatment wu and chai 2016 have also been used to proficiently remove bound water thus improving the sludge dewaterability it is noteworthy that the commonly used method for measuring the bound water is differential scanning calorimetry dsc lee and lee 1995 he et al 2015 li et al 2019a however this method has certain limitations like long reaction time and the controversial freezing temperature wu et al 2020a to address these issues wu et al 2018 and 2019 applied in situ synchrotron x ray computed microtomography and low field nmr to quantify the bound water in sludge with higher accuracy and convenience in a nutshell in depth understanding of the water occurrence states in sludge would be helpful to optimize the efficiency of sludge conditioning and dewatering 2 1 3 surface charge and particle size it is known that the negative surface charge would hinder the flocs flocculation and reduce the compressibility of sludge based on the dlvo theory kim et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 previous studies found that neutralizing negative surface charge of sludge and decreasing energy barrier of flocs would improve the hydrophobicity and flocculation of sludge thus promoting the solid liquid separation process li et al 2020b and yu et al 2021b indicated a reduction of negative charge could be achieved with fenton fenton like oxidation which is mainly attributed to eps degradation by reactive oxygen species ros and electrostatic neutralization by fe3 fe2 then hydration interaction energy and energy barrier between surface eps and bound water remarkably declined resulting in high hydrophobicity of the surface eps accordingly the sludge dewaterability was improved in our previous study the surface charge of sludge with different chemical treatments was investigated and compared liang et al 2020d despite the changes were detected how these treatments affected the lewis acid base interaction energy electrostatic repulsive interactions energy barrier and the hydrophobicity of sludge remained unknown in the future surface charge characteristics with different treatments should be considered to understand more on sludge dewaterability flocs particle size is another important factor influencing sludge dewaterability wei et al 2018 wu et al 2020a cao et al 2021 it is recognized that supplying chemical flocculants e g fecl3 polyaluminium chloride pac etc increased the particle size of sludge flocs to enlarge the density difference between solid and liquid phases facilitating follow up solid liquid separation process liang et al 2019a and b with respect to fenton fenton like conditioning treatment regulating flocs particle size involves two processes a the generated ros destroys the flocs and then reduces its particle size leading to flocs dispersion and water release ge et al 2020 b the released fe3 fe2 reassembles the dissociative flocs and then increases its particle size thus reducing the sludge viscosity li et al 2020a however there is no data directly reflecting the respective contributions of ros and fe3 fe2 to flocs particle size regulation therefore there is a need for quantitative determination of the suitable flocs particle size for satisfied sludge dewaterability 2 1 4 rheological properties rheology properties of sludge is generally applied to characterize the internal structure strength of flocs which reflects viscosity flowability and solid liquid separation efficiency of sludge li et al 2020a wu et al 2020a previous studies found that effective reduction of viscosity and water holding capacity of sludge could enhance sludge dewaterability xiao et al 2017b ge et al 2020 liang et al 2020b li et al 2020a and b and liang et al 2020a and b reported that the iron based aops could efficiently reduce the viscosity network strength and water holding capacity of sludge leading to high flowability and dewaterability of sludge despite some studies have preliminarily analyzed the relationship between rheology behavior and dewaterability most of them only focus on a single treatment therefore it is crucial to advance our understanding of fundamental relationships between rheology behavior and dewaterability with different conditioning treatments 2 2 types of mechanical dewatering devices mechanical dewatering process is often selected for sludge treatment wakeman 2007 mobaraki et al 2018 based on the source of applied force mechanical dewatering processes are divided into three types e g centrifuges belt presses and plate filter presses mowla et al 2013 the centrifuges and belt presses are more popular in wwtps owing to their simple and flexible operation procedure and low capital cost while the application of the plate filter presses would be restricted by the high capital and operating cost mobaraki et al 2018 different dewatering devices would directly affect the sludge dewatering efficiency pan et al 2003 generally the moisture content of sludge cake would be around 80 wt 75 wt and 65 wt with the dewatering by centrifuge belt press and plate filter press respectively pan et al 2003 mowla et al 2013 of note the above dewatering devices would not be able to further reduce the moisture content of sludge cake owing to the pressure limits of mechanical dewatering further reduction would require assistance of other chemical treatment furthermore such moisture content 65 wt can no longer meet the strict regulations from many government agencies rao et al 2021 this would require the further development of the highly efficient dewatering devices to tackle the challenges and further lower the moisture content of sludge liang et al 2015 and 2020c used the ultrahigh pressure filter press compressed pressure of 1 0 6 0 mpa to compress and dewater the sludge conditioned by fenton treatment results showed that under the compressed pressure of 6 0 mpa the moisture content of treated sludge would decrease to 50 wt furthermore mahmoud et al 2016 guo et al 2018 and rao et al 2021 reported that the pressurized electro dewatering devices could efficiently reduce the bound water content and the moisture content of sludge with low power consumption mobaraki et al 2018 showed that the high power ultrasound combined with vacuum filter system could favorably increase the total solid of sludge cake by 12 as compared with the vacuum filter system these results indicate the advance dewatering devices could effectively remove the bound water and realize high efficiency sludge dewatering nevertheless whether aops conditioning combined with these prospective dewatering devices can further reduce the moisture content requires detailed investigation through long term field trials in the future 3 fundamentals of iron based aops 3 1 homogeneous iron based aops system fenton system has existed for more than 100 years and been developed into different applications luo et al 2021 fenton system relies on chemical reactions of fe2 and h2o2 neyens and baeyens 2003 neyens et al 2004 which generate ros e g hydroxyl radical ho hydroperoxy radical ho2 and superoxide radical o 2 via chain reactions babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 three main chain reactions include a chain initiation eqs 1 3 b chain transfer eqs 4 7 and c chain termination eqs 8 10 babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 zhu et al 2019 in fenton reaction the generated fe3 eq 2 and chain transfer reactions eq 4 7 are recognized as the rate limiting steps in this system due to the consumption of h2o2 and ho luo et al 2021 1 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 ho o h 2 f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e 2 ho 2 h 3 ho 2 o 2 h 4 ho h 2 o 2 ho 2 h 2 o 5 ho h 2 o 2 o 2 h 2 o 6 ho r r h 2 o 7 o 2 r r o 2 8 r r r r 9 ho 2 ho 2 o 2 h 2 o 10 ho 2 ho o 2 h 2 o according to the chain reactions of fenton system fenton reaction efficiency is affected by the operating conditions such as ph h2o2 concentration fe2 concentration and temperature hodges et al 2018 fenton system is known for its simple and flexible operation as well as high organics degradation efficiency neyens and baeyens 2003 however the extreme acidic condition ph 3 0 wastage of oxidants and production of iron contained sludge may lead to high operating cost benatti et al 2009 hodges et al 2018 therefore the development of cost effective and highly efficient fenton system at around neutral ph is deemed necessary recently persulfate based fenton like systems have been introduced to allow the reaction occurring in a broader ph range 3 0 10 0 higher redox potential 2 5 3 1 ev and longer life span 30 40 μs ahmed et al 2012 peroxydisulfate pds and peroxymonosulfate pms are commonly used for generating so 4 zhou et al 2018 in contrast to pds pms is a more promising oxidant for micropollutants removal in wastewater due to its short bond length 1 46 å and nontoxic degradation byproducts wacławek et al 2017 breaking down the o o bond is the important step to produce so 4 from pds or pms matzek and carter 2016 various approaches including physical methods e g heat ultrasound and ultraviolet zhou et al 2018 luo et al 2021 and chemical methods e g alkali ozone and transition metals wang and wang 2018 have been developed for pds or pms activation among them fe2 is one of the efficient catalysts to activate pds or pms due to its convenient operation low cost and environmental friendly properties nfodzo and choi 2011 liu et al 2018 as shown in eq 11 fe2 donates an electron to pds and activates it liu et al 2018 fe2 can also react with pms to produce the active radicals e g ho and so 4 eqs 12 and 13 rastogi et al 2009 according to xiao et al 2020 reaction conditions including ph temperature fe2 dosage and pds pms dosages would affect the reaction efficiency it is known that fe2 pds pms would work in a wide ph range from 3 0 to 10 0 but the neutral ph would increase iron precipitation and thus lower the reaction efficiency giannakis et al 2016 to avoid the iron precipitation the ph of these systems should be set to acidic condition ph 5 0 xiao et al 2020 higher fe2 pds or pms dosage could promote so 4 production thus enhancing the micropollutants degradation in wastewater wacławek et al 2017 however the excessive fe2 and persulfate would also induce the quenching effects on so 4 and in turn hinder the reaction efficiency eqs 14 16 volpe et al 2013 xiao et al 2020 thus it is worthy to investigate the effects of dosage threshold on the activation of pds or pms in the fenton like system 11 f e 2 s 2 o 8 2 f e 3 so 4 so 4 2 12 f

above although homogenous iron based aops can successfully remove target contaminants via reactive radicals these technologies still face several inevitable challenges such as unstable activation efficiency uncontrollable radical formation rate and a notable quenching effect of oxidants and activators which would lead to low production of ros and thereby restrict the reaction efficiency zhou et al 2018 thus the heterogeneous iron based aops system has received greater attention chen et al 2014 notably iron based materials including fe0 iron oxides e g magnetite fe3o4 and goethite iron minerals e g pyrite siderite etc and synthetic loaded iron based materials are generally considered as competitive heterogeneous iron based aops catalysts owing to their low toxicity effective catalytic activity and high recovery efficiency fu et al 2014 rahim pouran et al 2015 luo et al 2021 fe0 a commonly used heterogeneous catalyst can effectively react with oxidants and generate reactive radicals due to its strong reducibility e0 fe2 fe0 0 447 v fu et al 2014 xiao et al 2020 fe0 based aops reactions can be divided into two stages a induction stage eqs 17 21 xu and wang 2011 wang et al 2020a and b rapid reaction stage eqs 1 11 and 12 oh et al 2016 kim et al 2018 after these two processes iron cycle could be occurred eq 22 further facilitating ros generation xiao et al 2020 however in these fe0 based aops systems the iron oxide e g fe3o4 and lepidocrocite γ feooh are formed and covers the fe0 surface causing low fe2 dissolution rate and limiting mass transfer rate guan et al 2015 in order to remove the passive layer of fe0 various pretreatments of fe0 have been investigated in recent years such as thermal pretreatment acid washing pretreatment ultrasonic pretreatment and pre magnetization pretreatment sun et al 2016 in addition the fe2 dissolution rate and mass transfer rate of reaction are also dependent on the particle size of fe0 thomas et al 2021 the smaller particle size of fe0 contains larger specific surface area and stronger reactivity which is in favor of rapid reaction with oxidants in this light nanoscale iron oxides iron minerals and synthetic loaded iron based materials could also be regarded as the effective iron based catalyst xiao et al 2020 generally characteristics of iron based materials are greatly determined by their synthesis methods the common synthesis methods include chemical co precipitation solvothermal procedure hydrothermal calcination borohydride reduction pyrolysis and etc thomas et al 2021 although these approaches are all available a simple and eco friendly method should be selected for large scale synthesis in order to minimize the preparation cost as mentioned above the iron based materials oxidants as competitive heterogeneous iron based aops systems could boost fe2 regeneration and fe3 fe2 cycle resulting in continuous ros generation these ros could proficiently remove the hydrophilic eps and improve the sludge dewaterability nevertheless a deep insight into such heterogeneous iron based aops systems in sludge dewatering process especially the fate of iron species is still lacking

art of the iron based aops for sludge conditioning as discussed previously sludge has poor compressibility strong hydrophilic properties and high levels of bound water which pose great challenges to separate water from the solids christensen et al 2015 currently the iron based aops have been recognized as a promising method to improve the sludge dewaterability because these methods can successfully remove the hydrophilic eps and promote the bound water release zhang et al 2015 xiao et al 2018 zhen et al 2018 liang et al 2020a and b according to the iron types the iron based aops for sludge conditioning can be mainly categorized as homogeneous iron based aops fe0 based aops ferrate based aops and electrolysis iron based aops which would be discussed in detail 4 1 homogeneous iron based aops homogeneous iron based aops could destroy the flocs structure and induce the release of eps and bound water from sludge fig 3 a yu et al 2016 guan et al 2018 thus realizing high sludge dewaterability table 1 the homogeneous iron based aops for sludge conditioning were implemented as early as 2003 when the first attempt of fenton system was conducted by lu et al 2003 this study found that the sludge dewaterability was significantly enhanced with the fenton treatment as indicated by the srf reduction of 90 0 under the optimal condition initial ph 3 0 fe2 dosage 6000 mg l h2o2 dosage 3000 mg l and reaction time 30 min the fenton reaction conditions for sludge treatment were later optimized by some researchers buyukkamaci 2004 neyens et al 2004 tony et al 2008 they concluded that initial ph fe2 concentration h2o2 concentration and reaction time all had the remarkable impacts on the sludge conditioning performance more effective sludge dewaterability could be achieved under the optimized conditions leading to a 50 reduction in capillary suction time cst buyukkamaci 2004 tony et al 2008 the method was also demonstrated at the pilot scale liu et al 2013a zhang et al 2015 liang et al 2015 for example liu et al 2013a using 50 0 l sludge volume concluded that the moisture content of sludge cake was as low as 49 5 wt at the initial ph of 5 0 fe2 concentration of 33 8 mg g ds h2o2 concentration of 40 3 mg g ds portland cement concentration of 349 9 mg g ds lime concentration of 500 0 mg g ds and reaction time of 60 min liang et al 2015 and zhang et al 2015 also showed that the moisture content of sludge cake was 60 wt under the optimum conditions of a fenton system treating 100 l sludge according to the abovementioned studies low ph ph 5 0 is a prerequisite of fenton reaction for excellent sludge dewaterability nevertheless acidification would complicate the conditioning procedure and increase the operation cost due to the downstream neutralization process masihi and gholikandi 2018 liang et al 2020b to solve this problem yu et al 2016 investigated the feasibility of fenton reaction for sludge deep dewatering at neutral ph the authors concluded that fenton treatment without adjustment of ph ph 6 7 could also effectively improve the sludge dewaterability moisture content of sludge cake 55 8 wt and the estimated cost of this fenton process was more economical over the conventional fecl3 cao treatment usd 43 8 ton ds vs usd 54 0 ton ds the effectiveness of fenton treatment for sludge dewatering was ascribed to the efficient removal of hydrophilic eps by ho oxidation and flocs recombination by fe3 flocculation notwithstanding it should be pointed out that such promising fenton process is deserved to be further demonstrated in the larger scale in order to evaluate its costs iron sludge production and utilization of sludge cake and filtrate compared to the conventional fenton system homogeneous iron based so 4 aops have received more attention table 1 because of its multiple benefits such as wider effective ph range 3 0 10 0 higher oxidizing potential 2 5 3 1 ev and stable oxidation efficiency zhen et al 2012 alexopoulou et al 2019 the homogeneous iron based so 4 aops were firstly performed by zhen et al 2012 who reported a desirable sludge dewaterability at a neutral ph cst reduction by 88 8 the optimized conditions were fe2 dosage of 1 5 mm g volatile suspend solid vss pds dosage of 1 2 mm g vss at conditioning time of 1 min the study displayed that so 4 generated from fe2 and pds reactions could effectively decompose the soluble eps and reduce viscosity leading to bound water release and improved dewaterability shi et al 2015 and song et al 2016 also concluded that fe2 and pds treatment was a feasible method for achieving sludge deep dewatering moisture content of sludge cake 60 wt cst reduction 90 moreover fe2 and pms treatment was also investigated to facilitate sludge dewaterability liu et al 2016 reported the srf reduction of 97 0 and cst reduction of 90 0 at neutral ph xiao et al 2017b and guo and zhou 2020 proposed that fe2 and pms treatment decomposed refractory and sticky biopolymers e g lmw proteins and polysaccharides as well as the internal backbone at neutral ph the iron based so 4 aops has a competitive advantage over the fenton treatments for sludge dewatering a possible reason for this is that homogeneous iron based so 4 aops could generate abundant ho and so 4 to remarkably remove the hydrophilic biopolymers in lb eps and tb eps and facilitate the bound water release under neutral conditions fig 3b however the overdose of pds pms or fe2 was not conducive to sludge dewatering due to the undesirable consumption of so 4 via quenching reactions eqs 14 16 volpe et al 2013 together although homogeneous iron based so 4 aops to certain extent can achieve high level sludge dewaterability at neutral ph it is worth noting that the residual sulfate ions generated from the treatment processes and the high cost of pds and pms pds 1100 usd ton pms 1300 usd ton should be taken into consideration in the large scale application shi et al 2015 liu et al 2016 song et al 2016 li et al 2020a in recent five years in order to find a stable and economical alternative to h2o2 pds pms several promising oxidants e g peracetic acid paa cao2 calcium hypochlorite ca clo 2 sodium percarbonate sp na2co3 1 5h2o2 and sodium sulfite na2so3 that are commonly applied in wastewater treatment have been studied for sludge conditioning table 1 wang et al 2015 wu and chai 2016 yu et al 2019a li et al 2020a ai et al 2021 it was found that 3000 mg fe2 l and 100 mg paa g tss could reduce srf by 90 0 wang et al 2015 0 625 mmol fe2 g tss and 50 mg cao2 g tss reduced srf and cst by 92 6 and 85 7 respectively wu and chai 2016 which were comparable to the fenton system yu et al 2016 yu et al 2019a reported that fe2 ca clo 2 treatment could simultaneously achieve sludge deep dewatering and total coliforms inactivation posing more competitive advantages over fenton system li et al 2020a and ai et al 2021 concluded that fe2 sp treatment and fe2 na2so3 treatment favorably improved the sludge dewatering and were more economically attractive for future applications as compared to the fe2 h2o2 pds pms treatments zhang et al 2015 liu et al 2016 these fe2 promising oxidants could become a feasible technology for upgrading sludge dewaterability through remarkable cell lysis intracellular sticky organics release and bound water reduction the improved sludge dewaterability is likely owing to the formation of stronger ros e g ho so 4 so 3 o 2 chlorine free radicals carbon centered radicals fe iv reactive intermediate species and etc from fe2 promising oxidants kim et al 2019 ai et al 2021 cao et al 2021 however the specific roles of the such different ros on the sludge dewaterability require further study apart from the abovementioned homogeneous iron based aops fenton like systems e g fe3 h2o2 and organic acids cleated fe2 oxidants are also viable to enhance the sludge dewatering via facilitating iron cycle for more ros production table 1 tony et al 2011 he et al 2015 and 2017 wang et al 2019 yang et al 2021a however it is of note their dewatering efficiency and economic viabilities are unclear at this stage 4 2 fe0 and iron minerals based aops over the last decade fe0 based aops is one of the heterogeneous aops that has been extensively used to improve sludge dewaterability table 2 such method can minimize the chemical dosages and avoid iron sludge accumulation fe0 is a cost effective and eco friendly iron source fu et al 2014 zhou et al 2014b 2015 and 2017 yu et al 2019b liang et al 2020a zhou et al 2014b 2015 and 2017 mentioned that fe0 combined with commonly used oxidants e g h2o2 pds and pms could be a potential alternative to conventional fenton treatment yu et al 2019b showed that cst and srf was reduced by 81 8 and 41 9 respectively with fe0 ozonation treatment liang et al 2020a and liu et al 2021 applied fe0 potassium permanganate kmno4 treatment and fe0 na2so3 treatment respectively to condition sludge and found that the moisture content of sludge cake decreased to 70 wt after treatments the inconsistent effect of fe0 oxidants on sludge dewaterability may be related to the fe dissolution liang et al 2020a noticeably fe0 based aops treatment could save 20 40 of operating cost over the homogeneous iron based aops zhou et al 2015 liang et al 2020a liu et al 2021 mainly due to reusability of fe0 although the fe0 based aops treatment exhibits economic advantages this approach also faces some unavoidable challenges including unsatisfied dewatering efficiency and low fe0 utilization efficiency which may limit its future application liang et al 2020a to tackle these issues several studies have attempted to use physical methods to enhance the efficiency li et al 2018 successfully combined thermal treatment with fe0 pms to improve sludge dewaterability moisture content of sludge cake 66 0 wt liu et al 2020 reported that cst reduction and moisture content was 89 2 and 67 9 wt with ultrasound fe0 pms treatment these physical treatments assisted approaches could facilitate the production of highly active radicals ho and so 4 thereby efficiently decrease negative charge on the surface of sludge and remove the hydrophilic eps so as to enhance sludge flowability and solid liquid separation efficiency our previous studies applied thermal acid pretreatment and ultrasound thermal acid pretreatment to remove the passive layer of fe0 and further accelerated the iron release rate and fe0 reaction efficiency liang et al 2020a and c fig 4 a accordingly moisture content of sludge cake was 55 wt with the pretreated fe0 oxidants conditioning method meanwhile the excellent performance could be maintained for more than 10 continuous cycles exhibiting the superiority of this system recently the complexation agents e g humic acid ha and nitrilotriacetic acid nta were introduced into fe0 oxidant system which could facilitate the production of highly active radicals and further boost the sludge dewaterability hao et al 2018 liang et al 2020b a possible reason for this is that the addition of ha and nta could facilitate fe dissolution and form chelated soluble fe2 species these chelated species upon exposed to air would be instantly oxidized through fenton like reaction forming chelated soluble fe3 species which could be promptly reduced to fe2 via electrons transfer from fe0 such iron cycle could finally promote oxidants decomposition to generate highly active radicals li et al 2019b overall although the advances of fe0 based aops are well recognized in the field of sludge dewatering several issues should be resolved such as fe0 agglomeration low fe0 mass transport efficiency and low fe0 utilization efficiency compared to fe0 iron rich mineral is a cheaper and more stable iron source which has been chosen to activate the oxidants for degradation of micropollutants in wastewater chen et al 2014 feng et al 2018 recently liu 2019 li et al 2021 and liang et al 2021 evaluated the feasibility of using iron rich mineral based aops to improve the sludge dewaterability they found that vanadium titanium magnetite vtm pms siderite pms and pyrite pms treatments exhibited a great potential for enhancing sludge dewaterability and these systems could constantly release highly active radicals to remove the hydrophilic eps and improve the flowability it should be emphasized that tao et al 2019 combined fe rich biochar from fenton treated sludge with oxidants to condition the sludge and achieved moisture content of sludge cake of 46 4 wt fig 4b likewise xiao et al 2021b prepared a sludge derived biochar loaded with mnfe2o4 mnfe2o4 sbc to catalyze ozonation that was used for enhancing sludge dewaterability the promotion of sludge dewaterability in the iron rich mineral based aops could be because the iron rich mineral enhanced the fe3 fe2 cycle in aops and offered sufficient fe2 to react with oxidants for ros production luo et al 2021 as such this environment friendly sludge dewatering approach deserves to be investigated further as mentioned above the characteristics of iron rich mineral are largely influenced by their synthesis methods and the particle size which should be optimized before application 4 3 ferrate based aops ferrate as a high valent iron has been adopted in wastewater treatment as it can serve as a strong oxidizer and coagulant jiang 2014 ferrate has recently been applied in the sludge conditioning as well zhang et al 2012 and 2016b wu et al 2020b zhang et al 2012 reported that ferrate could potentially enhance the sludge dewaterability at the ferrate dosage of 1000 mg l and ph of 3 0 accordingly the srf and moisture content of sludge was reduced by 30 5 and 12 5 respectively zhang et al 2016b also found that under the strong acidic condition ph 4 0 the srf was reduced by 90 at ferrate dosage of 100 mg g tss wu et al 2020b found that the ferrate treatment could remarkably improve the sludge dewaterability as indicated by a srf reduction of 50 the working mechanism of ferrate in sludge conditioning has been proposed first ferrate solubilizes the protein like substrate in the eps layers and liberates the bound water through oxidation process second fe3 from ferrate re flocculates the dissociative flocs and eps thus leading to the formation of porous structure and dewatering channel zhang et al 2016b as such the sludge changes to the low viscosity of gel like matters and facilitates the solid water separation process via the mechanical dewatering in this process iron valence state in ferrate served as an important role which deserved to further investigate despite the ferrate treatment promotes sludge dewaterability with noticeable environmental benefits the implementation of ferrate treatment in sludge conditioning process is still challenging due to the low stability of ferrate complicate preparation process of ferrate unsatisfied dewatering efficiency and strong acidic condition more efforts are required to overcome these challenges 4 4 electro iron based aops so far electro iron based aops in sludge conditioning have received great attention due to their high efficiency and low chemicals consumption masihi and gholikandi 2018 in the electro iron based aops iron based materials could possess two functions namely catalyst and electrode luo et al 2021 for example fe2 was used as catalyst in the electro fenton like system for improving sludge dewaterability in which the anode and cathode were ti ruo2 meshes respectively zhen et al 2013 this combined system achieved 90 dewatering efficiency indicating the effectiveness of this treatment moreover a combination of electrolysis and fe2 pds method consumed 60 less chemicals than the fe2 pds method zhen et al 2012 when achieving similar srf reduction likewise masihi and gholikandi 2018 cai et al 2019 and chen et al 2019 also demonstrated the effectiveness and stability of electro fenton process for enhancing sludge dewaterability where the iron based materials acted as catalyst the possible reason is that these systems can facilitate the redox cycle of iron ions via molecular oxygen activation on the cathode hu et al 2018 then more ros were generated via the combination of fenton fenton like reaction and anodic oxidation in the electro fenton system luo et al 2021 thus conducing to high removal of lb eps and tb eps in addition li et al 2016 applied fe0 as electrode in the electro iron based aops for sludge dewatering results indicated that the electrolysis fe0 pds treatment significantly reduced the srf and cst by 87 4 and 49 1 respectively in this system sufficient fe2 could be generated from sacrificial iron anode and fe3 fe2 cycle could be accelerated after supplying electrons from electrode luo et al 2021 more fe2 released in the system could efficiently activate oxidants to destroy sludge flocs and remove hydrophilic eps leading to effective sludge dewaterability in the electro iron based aops system the applied voltage is the crucial operating condition influencing the conversion rates of fe3 to fe2 and then affecting the sludge dewaterability hu et al 2018 the remarkable improvement of sludge dewaterability by electro iron based aops with increasing the current applied can be attributed to the efficient activation of oxidants by released fe2 li et al 2016 in addition to the applied voltage the operational conditions e g ph reaction times and chemical dosages would also affect the iron transformation which should be further investigated in the system the main challenges of the electro fenton fenton like systems are high energy consumption and the corrosion of electrode wu et al 2020a which would increase the operational cost and hinder its utilization very recently wang et al 2021b indicated that imposing electric field on the iron based aops not only boosted the ros generation via accelerating the iron cycle but also induced in situ generation of h2o2 through reducing oxygen such reagent free technologies could further save the storage space of chemicals and reduce the construction cost in practical application however high energy cost and the electrode corrosion should not be ignored 4 5 factors influencing the performance of iron based aops in the sludge conditioning process given the sensitive reaction conditions of iron based aops and the complex sludge composition various reaction factors and environmental factors that affect sludge dewaterability should be fully understood as such the reaction conditions of iron based aops e g initial ph dosages of iron and oxidants temperature and reaction time buyukkamaci 2004 liu et al 2013a babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 and the environmental factors e g sludge types organic matter contents eps contents and microbiome liang et al 2015 wu et al 2020a are discussed in this section the initial ph of iron based aops is regarded as an important reaction condition in the sludge dewatering process zhang et al 2015 and 2016b masihi and gholikandi 2018 it would directly influence the reaction efficiency and the ros generation thomas et al 2021 iron based aops usually exhibit ph dependent performance it is generally accepted that acidic condition ph 5 0 is a requisite factor of the fenton fenton like treatments as low ph promotes the reaction efficiency and ros production for example the most effective performance was found at ph of 3 0 in the fenton fenton like treatments moisture content of sludge cake 60 0 wt liang et al 2015 and 2020a li et al 2020a higher ph worsened the fenton fenton like treatment performance due to the insufficient oxidizing capability zhang et al 2015 impressively the so 4 based aops could efficiently work at wider ph range 3 0 ph 8 0 liu et al 2020 zhen et al 2012 and guo and zhou 2020 pointed out that cst reduction was higher than 88 after so 4 based aops treatment at neutral ph confirming the effectiveness of the method accordingly downstream acidification and neutralization are no longer needed in such treatment which could simplify the process and save the operational cost in addition the so 4 based aops treatment was also demonstrated in ad sludge dewatering process without ph adjustment wang et al 2019 liu et al 2020 and 2021 the dosages of iron and oxidants in the iron based aops have remarkable impacts on the sludge dewaterability since they would directly affect the overall reaction liu et al 2018 wu et al 2020a thomas et al 2021 it is known that increasing the iron or oxidants dosage would increase the sludge dewaterability but the performance may deteriorate if iron or oxidants are overdosed song et al 2016 masihi and gholikandi 2018 zhen et al 2018 liang et al 2020a hence the dosage of iron and oxidants needs to be optimized to minimize the operating cost and achieve the highest sludge dewaterability temperature also plays a crucial role in the iron based aops reaction because it influences the iron dissolution and catalytic efficiency in the reaction li et al 2018 thomas et al 2021 previous studies reported that increasing temperature could improve the reactive radical generation thus promoting sludge dewaterability xiao et al 2017c li et al 2018 liang et al 2020a although the thermal treatment induced high sludge dewaterability these thermal iron based aops suffer from the issues such as high energy consumption and high operational cost leading to its limited application in fact waste heat in wwtps can be employed to lower the energy consumption reaction time would also have a considerable effect on the sludge dewaterability buyukkamaci 2004 liang et al 2015 chen et al 2019 guo and zhou 2020 chen et al 2019 mentioned that the optimal reaction time was observed to be 40 min with the electro fenton treatment longer time may result in the over oxidation effect and worsen sludge dewaterability likewise in the fe2 pms treatment with the extension of reaction time sludge dewaterability gradually decreased guo and zhou 2020 it is known that shortening the reaction time can reduce the volume of conditioning tank in practice leading to lower capital cost accordingly the optimal reaction time can be investigated before the implementation besides the reaction conditions the environmental factors would also have a considerable impact christensen et al 2015 liang et al 2015 skinner et al 2015 wang et al 2020b the types of sludge would directly affect iron based aop conditioning processes as the ad sludge characteristics particularly eps components were far complex from that of waste activated sludge was xiao et al 2017a cao et al 2021 compared to was the ad sludge dewaterability was poorer owing to its higher content of colloidal biopolymers e g high molecular weight polycyclic steroid like substances and aromatic compounds and low molecular weight protein and higher viscosity lu et al 2018 li et al 2019a such large amounts of refractory biopolymers would scavenge ros and thus reduce the iron based aop conditioning efficiency high organic content is one of the barriers for sludge dewatering as high organic content sludge generally contains high eps content bound water content negative zeta potential as well as strong network strength resulting in worse aggregation and flocculation liang et al 2015 skinner et al 2015 wang et al 2020b liang et al 2015 noted that higher organic content of sludge consumed more chemicals and required longer reaction time to achieve acceptable sludge dewaterability note that the changes in microbial community especially gathering the organics degrading bacteria would stimulate the decrease of hydrophilic eps components and enhance the sludge dewaterability thus further affect the processing efficiency liang et al 2022 the dissolved organic matters dom microbial secretion multiple heavy metals various anions and hydrophilic micropollutants in the sludge rehman et al 2018 usually also consume the reactive radicals and further restrict the reaction efficiency zhou et al 2018 to date few studies considered the effects of these environmental factors on the iron based aops during the conditioning and dewatering process collectively it is imperative to further study the environmental factors affecting the sludge dewaterability to speed up its future applications 4 6 process adaptability of the iron based aops for sludge conditioning according to the above mentioned studies the iron based aops have been recognized as the promising and efficient approach to achieve sludge deep dewatering however the environmental factors particularly types of sludge e g was and ad sludge would notably influence the dewatering efficiency in the iron based aops in order to maximize sludge dewaterability and minimize operational costs different sludge would require different measures fenton treatment fe2 combined with paa cao2 ca clo 2 sp treatment and ferrate based aops could be preferentially utilized in was dewatering as these methods could rapidly remove the hydrophilic biopolymers and then enhance the sludge dewaterability via strong oxidation ability with low cost and high benefit given the high alkalinity and large amounts of refractory biopolymers in ad sludge iron based so 4 aops complexation agents fe0 based aops and electro iron based aops would be the preferable and economical options as they could effectively destroy the refractory biopolymers and further promote the sludge dewatering without ph adjustment note that it is of important significance to select an optimal iron based aops method to achieve the desired outcome with high flexibility among the iron based aops treatment iron based so 4 aops and electro iron based aops could become the feasible and promising choices to achieve sludge deep dewatering owing to their wider applicability and higher operation effectiveness which is better suited to future practical application towards economic benefits accordingly further long term investigation is required to evaluate their pros and cons 5 mechanisms and challenges 5 1 sludge dewatering mechanisms the underlying mechanisms of the iron based aops are generally divided into two steps a oxidation step and b flocculation step fig 5 a in the oxidation step highly ros are generated from the iron based aops which could effectively destroy the flocs structure and microbial cell structure accordingly the hydrophilic substances e g tyrosine like proteins tryptophan like proteins fulvic acid like materials and humic acid like substances and the sticky biopolymers e g high molecular weight hmw proteins hmw polysaccharides lmw proteins and lmw polysaccharides in the lb eps and tb eps could be significantly removed resulting in the release of intracellular water xiao et al 2017a zhang et al 2019 liang et al 2020b meanwhile these ros also induce the destruction of the hydrophilic functional groups e g c o stretch ch cn stretch and c o symmetric stretching associated with proteins coh and co associated with polysaccharides the secondary structure of protein molecules e g β sheet and α helix n containing bond and hydrophilic amino acid in the lb eps and tb eps thus further decreasing the particle size hydrophilicity and viscosity of sludge li et al 2020a ai et al 2021 xiao et al 2021a in the flocculation step the iron flocs from the iron based aops could efficiently flocculate the dissociative flocs and eps through energy barrier reduction and charge neutralization which is conducive to the increment in flowability and hydrophobicity of sludge yu et al 2021a as such the sludge dewaterability is enhanced it should be pointed out that despite the oxidation and flocculation steps are recognized as the main sludge dewatering mechanisms it is still not conclusive which step is the key to improve sludge dewaterability to identify the contribution of the two steps radical species were quenched and the results indicated that the main factor contributing to the enhancement of sludge dewaterability was the oxidation step li et al 2019a liu et al 2020 however some studied also proved the flocculation was the dominant step liang et al 2020b and c therefore more efforts are required to illustrate these contradictory results additionally it is also unclear whether these two steps occur simultaneously or sequentially which merits further investigation in terms of the oxidation degree of eps in the iron based aops two mechanisms were proposed namely excessive oxidation and moderate oxidation fig 5b yu et al 2019a and 2021b in the excessive oxidation process more reactive radicals are available that degrade more hydrophobic eps and produce smaller particle size of sludge accordingly the hydrophilicity hydration interaction energy and energy barrier of sludge flocs are significantly enhanced thus increasing the repulsive interactions between sludge flocs and bound water content in the moderate oxidation process hydrophobic eps would not be drastically destroyed a great mass of hydrophobic eps layer retains which facilitates the release of bound water taken together maintaining the hydrophobic eps of sludge at appropriate amount is the most important step for the improvement of sludge dewaterability such information however is very limited so far 5 2 limitations and challenges as stated previously four major issues concerning the iron based aops in sludge dewatering process were discussed e g long pretreatment time high dosages of chemicals high operational cost and prerequisite acid conditions some other challenges are further discussed in this section it is known that many factors including composition of influent in wwtps sewage treatment technology and seasonal changes in temperature would greatly affect sludge characteristics thus causing remarkable changes in the eps composition and sludge dewaterability christensen et al 2015 yang et al 2015 cao et al 2021 owing to the complicated sludge characteristics how to choose a suitable iron based aops towards economic benefits and operation effectiveness is still enormously challenged liang et al 2015 yu et al 2017 and wang et al 2020b used linear modeling technique to develop the correlation between sludge organic fraction and its dewaterability and offered a selection method for high level sludge dewatering optimization nevertheless due to the underrepresentation of samples and the limitation of linear model the selection of methods and the operation conditions should be further optimized deep machine learning technology e g artificial neural networks ann random forest decision trees and etc as an advanced tool in environmental engineering could be utilized to achieve such purpose in the sludge dewatering process also based on large data sets real time intelligent decision making and continuous optimal control strategies could be realized and the relevant trends could be predicted in the future zhong et al 2021 in addition to the sludge characteristics the decision should also be made based on the final management of sludge e g resource recovery or disposal as the iron based aops are rapidly progressing in sludge dewatering area fig 1 yu et al 2019b chen et al 2019 li et al 2020a it is crucial to clearly understand the fundamental mechanisms of these processes numerous studies traced the changes in physicochemical characteristics of sludge e g eps content zeta potential particle size bound water rheological properties hydrophilicity hydrophobicity and electrical repulsive force to elucidate the potential dewatering mechanisms by iron based aops treatment yu et al 2016 zhen et al 2018 li et al 2019a liu et al 2020 liang et al 2020a but the direct evidence is still lacking the changes in the water holding capacities of flocs water solid interface behavior and binding force between water and eps proteins can be studied further through the in situ visualization methods e g in situ synchrotron x ray computed microtomography and low field nmr the impacts of different types of amino acids on sludge dewaterability should merit to be investigated molecular insight into the binding property between water and amino acids is worthy of exploration as well in addition the study on mechanistic chemical reactions involved in the iron based aops can be carried out in depth thomas et al 2021 demonstrated that density functional theory dft can be used to understand the roles of catalytic activity in the iron based aops reactions the findings would promote the optimization of catalyst performance and reaction efficiency moreover extensive studies demonstrated the reactive radicals e g ho so 4 and o 2 generation in the iron based aops was the main mechanism of sludge dewatering li et al 2019a and 2020a liu et al 2020 nevertheless the non radicals e g 1o2 and high valent iron probably participate in changing sludge dewaterability as well owing to their oxidation capacity lee et al 2020 in the future the contribution of these non radicals is also a valuable research direction for the underlying dewatering mechanism noticeably the iron valence state has a significant influence on the overall reaction so the variations in the iron valence state during the iron based aops process should be tracked via tracing x ray absorption spectroscopy xas or xps thomas et al 2021 taken together the in depth understanding of the dewatering mechanisms would be beneficial to optimize chemicals consumption and operating conditions previous studies reported that a broad spectrum of micropollutants e g pharmaceuticals personal care products biocides and antibiotics and many other emerging pollutants e g microplastics antibiotic resistant genes args perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos have been extensively detected in sludge yang et al 2013 zareitalabad et al 2013 gulde et al 2016 mahon et al 2017 yu et al 2020b which receives rising concerns in the downstream sludge treatment as such efficient pre treatment is necessary to remove them before downstream sludge treatment previous studies reported that the iron based aops treatment could potentially achieve such goal during sludge dewatering process in our previous study triclosan removal efficiency was 35 in the pyrite pms treatment process liang et al 2021 lu et al 2020 and zhang et al 2022 indicated that the ho and so 4 produced from iron based aops could simultaneously enhance sludge dewaterability and args removal nevertheless in the light of the complicated nature and the extensive spectrum of micropollutants emerging pollutants it is not easy to resolve all issues in the iron based aops dewatering process besides some of the contaminants in sludge may be transformed or degraded during the iron based aops treatment more toxic by products might be generated as well additionally various functional groups such as carboxyl and amino groups in eps provide abundant binding sites for contaminants sheng et al 2010 liang et al 2021 during the sludge conditioning process the highly reactive radicals generated from iron based aops may inevitably contact with the contaminants bound with eps nevertheless whether the highly reactive radicals directly degrade contaminants bound with eps or destroy the binding bond between contaminants and eps then release the contaminants back to liquid phase has not been thoroughly elucidated note that more future studies should focus on the unresolved issues mentioned above in order to develop efficient iron based aops for simultaneous enhancement of sludge dewaterability and contaminants removal heavy metals e g as cd cr cu pb and zn and metal resistant genes involved in the sludge would also pose a potential threat to surrounding environments bondarczuk et al 2016 liang et al 2020b the changes of the metals and metal resistant genes during the iron based aops treatment are unclear noticeably sludge is believed to be a reservoir of pathogens e g fecal coliform e coli and klebsiella pneumoniae and viruses e g sars cov 2 and hku1 yang et al 2022 posing an infection risk during sludge collection transportation treatment and disposal processes yu et al 2019b and li et al 2020b evaluated the feasibility of using fe0 based aops to fecal coliform inactivation during the sludge dewatering process and found that ho could effectively destroy the cell wall and then inactivate the pathogens however the fate and transformation of other pathogens and viruses during iron based aops dewatering process still require further investigation also it is of importance to elucidate the synergistic mechanisms of pathogens viruses inactivation and sludge dewatering enhancement during iron based aops process which helps to cut down the risk of pathogens and viruses spreading into the environment compared to the commonly used chemical conditioning methods e g polyacrylamide fecl3 cao the iron based aops treatment has some competitive advantages in the sludge dewatering namely higher sludge dewatering efficiency 95 lower moisture content of sludge cake 60 wt lower operational costs yu et al 2016 liang et al 2020d cao et al 2021 more importantly the iron based aops treatment could potentially alleviate the environmental risks of micropollutants emerging pollutants heavy metals and pathogens in sludge li et al 2020b liang et al 2020d and 2021 zhang et al 2022 which is highly conducive to downstream sludge treatment and disposal e g incineration land application and composting despite the lab scale or pilot scale iron based aops have been successfully applied for sludge dewatering liang et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 yu et al 2016 and 2019a the main challenges of its full scale application are the potential exposure risks of harmful chemicals to operative employees and the safety concerns some of the chemicals used in the iron based aops treatment are unstable corrosive and hazardous heat and toxic gasses are released in this process this would induce the occupational health concerns also given the sensitive reaction conditions of iron based aops the strict and complex procedures of such treatment would require skilled employee in addition to the above mentioned concerns more efforts are required to evaluate the engineering applicability for example the long term field test is not available the optimization of operating factors operating costs and human resource management should be performed at larger scale in particular the utilization of costly chemicals e g pds pms paa h2o2 fe2 fe0 etc should be investigated further sustainable and reagent free technologies such as in situ generation of oxidants and iron via electrocatalysis wang et al 2021b are urgent to be developed towards higher economic benefits and sustainability besides filter cloth fouling is another challenge during the sludge dewatering process as the filter cloth is a costly consumable wakeman 2007 therefore the effects of different iron based aops on the filter cloth durability would be interesting to study it should be noted that the automatic integrated sludge conditioning and dewatering facilities e g automatic dosing and pressing systems should be developed in the future in order to reduce the labor costs and further promote the treatment efficiency last but not the least when implementing iron based aops for sludge deep dewatering the methods to deal with downstream iron rich sludge disposal and the color of the dewatering liquor caused by the fe accumulation are to be developed more importantly the cumulative eco toxicity of iron rich sludge and iron rich dewatering liquor should be fully understood 6 resource recovery and future perspectives after solid liquid separation the iron contained sludge and dewatering liquor are the two residual products in the iron based aops treatment processes with an increasing global demand for renewable energy and sustainable development these two residuals could potentially become the recyclable resources raheem et al 2018 due to the abundant valuable nutrients such as biodegradable organic matters nitrogen n phosphorus p etc kominko et al 2019 in this section the feasibility of reusing dewatering liquor and iron contained sludge is discussed generally as approximately 20 30 of n and p from wastewater are found in sludge dewatering liquor gourdet et al 2017 simoes et al 2020 with the iron based aops treatment the sludge flocs could be largely disintegrated resulting in more than 100 enhancement of the n and p contents in the sludge dewatering liquor gong et al 2015 which can be recovered as nutrient source nutrient recovery from dewatering liquor not only reduces the loads on wastewater treatment works but also to some extend solve the problem of resource shortage raheem et al 2018 crystallization is a commonly applied method to recover n and p from dewatering liquor via the formation of struvite magnesium ammonium phosphate mgnh4po4 6h2o ping et al 2016 or hydroxyapatite hap ca5 po4 3oh rittmann et al 2011 currently p recovery via the generation of vivianite crystals could be an attractive technology as the vivianite can either be a potential fertilizer or used in the electronics industry wilfert et al 2018 tian et al 2019 for example cao et al 2019 mentioned that p in iron contained fermentation dewatering liquor could be effectively recovered as vivianite with applicable ph control 6 0 9 0 wu et al 2020c also reported that 83 1 of the p in the iron contained ad supernatant was successfully recovered as high purity vivianite 93 9 apart from n and p the abundant carbon source also remained in the dewatering liquor simoes et al 2020 owing to the higher carbon content of ad dewatering liquor soluble chemical oxygen demand scod 800 mg l ad dewatering liquor could be considered as a sustainable and cost effective carbon source for biological treatment processes e g anaerobic anoxic oxic process and ad process gourdet et al 2017 cao et al 2019 aerobic granules peyong et al 2012 partial nitritation anammox pn a process han et al 2020 and algae growth chen et al 2016b which has been becoming a promising direction for ad dewatering liquor utilization noticeably the color of the ad dewatering liquor caused by the presence of iron remains as a challenging issue tian and yu 2020 it is necessary to investigate the fates of iron species including their transformations and interactions with organic or inorganic matters in the operation process additionally the colored ad dewatering liquor may not have significant influence on the environment when the iron contained dewatering liquor is returned to the ad system to simultaneously enhance methane production and hydrogen sulfide h2s control luo et al 2018 salehin et al 2020 furthermore the colored ad dewatering liquor offers iron and nutrient source to the novel feammox process for continuous nitrogen removal in wastewater treatment yang et al 2021b noteworthily due to the lower carbon content scod 400 mg l was dewatering liquor could be returned to the inlet of wwtps as the carbon replenishment the residual solids e g sludge cake contains organic matters microbes bacterial constituents e g proteins polysaccharides lipids etc valuable inorganic ingredients e g n p k ca etc and iron kelessidis and stasinakis 2012 tyagi and lo 2013 raheem et al 2018 generally there are four options for the biosolids recovery and reuse including construction materials iron rich biochar environment friendly functional materials land applications and biorefinery products tyagi and lo 2013 gherghel et al 2019 qian et al 2019 wu et al 2020a however the presence of iron in sludge cake could affect the feasibility of biosolids recovery and reuse the conversion of sludge into construction materials has become a mature route for sludge utilization tyagi and lo 2013 the sludge cake containing the inorganic complexes e g silicon dioxide could replace fractional petroleum coke and limestone to produce cement and bricks during co incineration smol et al 2015 abuşoğlu et al 2017 the presence of iron in the sludge would potentially influence the structure of cement and bricks for example kappel et al 2017 mentioned that the iron contained sludge could substitute 20 cement and also enhanced the compressive strength and workability of mortar kizinievič et al 2013 reported that using the iron contained sludge as the additive 10 the compressive flexural strength of bricks was remarkably higher than the reference clay bricks the aforementioned results indicate using iron contained sludge as the additive could potentially promote stability of cement and bricks however this research is in its infancy further research is deserved to investigate the influence of environmental factors e g temperature humidity and etc on the stability of construction materials derived from iron contained sludge in the long term field tests second in australia us and some european countries land application is one of the preferable options for sludge reuse owing to their rich nutrients collivignarelli et al 2019 prior to the land application sludge cake needs to be stabilized aerobic composting in order to realize toxicity reduction e g heavy metals and contaminants and pathogen destruction gherghel et al 2019 to date few studies investigated the iron contained sludge on land application soon et al 1978 mentioned that iron contained sludge could promote the growth of bromegrass due to the roles of iron in promoting enzyme activity liang et al 2020d reported that the iron based aops could mitigate the environmental risk of heavy metals and the phytotoxicity of sludge cake thus promoting its land application in this light the iron contained sludge could be potentially applied to soil for improvement of soil structure porosity and moisture retention noticeably to prevent food chain contamination from heavy metals the iron contained sludge is more suitable for forestry and grasslands application as well as the contaminated soil site remediation therefore further studies can investigate its long term performance third owing to the affluent contents of carbon and iron in the sludge cake a promising sustainable and feasible alternative of sludge reuse is to produce iron rich biochar or environment friendly functional materials via pyrolysis process wu et al 2020a for example wang et al 2021a used iron rich biochar produced from fenton sludge to boost the methane production in the ad system through direct interspecies electron transfer diet tao et al 2019 applied carbon based functional material derived from iron contained sludge to facilitate the bound water released and the sludge dewaterability accordingly such approaches can fulfill zero disposal of sludge cake which is conducive to the development of green circular economy in the future life cycle assessment lca and life cycle cost lcc should be carried out at large scale in order to accelerate the development of the fe sludge reutilization additionally when implementing the sludge cake pyrolysis technology in further application several issues need to be considered 1 different iron based aops may lead to the variation of the characteristics of sludge cake and further alter the properties of iron rich biochar functional materials 2 the pyrolysis operational factors e g temperature temperature increase rate and heating time may affect the quality of iron biochar 3 the transformations of micropollutants emerging pollutants and heavy metals in sludge cake during the pyrolysis process is still not clear 4 the potential emissions of hazardous gas during iron biochar pyrolysis process should be investigated forth aside from nutrients of n and p some biorefinery products including enzymes bio plastics bio pesticides eps flame retardant and proteins can also be recovered from sludge via advanced techniques tyagi and lo 2013 raheem et al 2018 kim et al 2019 these biorefinery products are regarded as feedstock in industrial workshops such as pharmaceutical food cosmetics detergent and fine chemicals tyagi and lo 2013 collivignarelli et al 2019 with regard to iron contained sludge the strong affinity between iron and eps proteins enzymes may reduce biorefinery products recovery efficiencies li et al 2012 further studies should focus on the feasibility to recover biorefinery products from iron contained sludge based on the discussion above a sustainable technology roadmap towards high efficient resource recovery in wwtps is proposed fig 6 the scenarios considered for critical interlinkages in wwtps based on water waste energy nexus mainly including biological treatment ad process sludge conditioning and dewatering processes and sludge reuse system by introducing the scrap iron into the ad system the biogas energy can be efficiently recovered to offset the energy consumption in wwtps waste energy then directly dosing oxidants into the iron rich digestate can achieve high sludge dewaterability after the dewatering process c n and p in iron contained dewatering liquor can be recovered and the residuals can be returned to biological treatment processes as a carbon source water energy meanwhile the iron contained sludge can be converted to iron rich environment materials which can be potentially utilized in the advanced wastewater treatment or ad system waste water during these processes emissions to air water and soil can be significantly cut down we believe that this scheme provides an efficient strategy and competitive scenario to challenge conventional sludge treatment and management strategy taking a further step towards realizing the transition of wwtps to resource recovery plants as well as achieving prospect of water waste energy nexus and sustainable development in the future 7 conclusion and remarks this review summarizes the development of iron based aops in sludge dewatering over the past 20 years offers a holistic analysis on their deficiencies and proposes future research prospects in this area the following conclusions could be put forward based on this review eps content bound water surface charge particle size and rheological properties of sludge are the key factors controlling the barriers of sludge dewaterability the types of mechanical dewatering devices would directly affect the sludge dewatering efficiency homogeneous and heterogeneous iron based aop systems could be applied in both water and sludge treatment via generation of highly reactive radicals the reaction conditions of the iron based aops and the environmental factors would largely affect the sludge dewatering performance among the iron based aops treatment iron based so 4 aops and electro iron based aops could become the effective and promising choices for sludge dewatering owing to their wider applicability higher process efficiency and more economic viability iron based aops cause the variations in the physicochemical characteristics of sludge meantime oxidation and flocculation processes are the underlying mechanisms of sludge dewatering enhancement the major challenges of the real application of the iron based aop for sludge dewatering included the sensitive reaction conditions the occupational health and safety concerns possible production of harmful secondary compounds parameter optimization operation consumables and labor costs the potential reutilization of iron contained sludge and dewatering liquor is systematically summarized for liquid phase valuable nutrients such as c n and p could be recovered there are mainly four options proposed for sludge cake utilization including construction materials iron rich biochar environment friendly functional materials land applications and biorefinery products although significant progress of iron based aops for sludge dewatering have been made currently it should be noted that several unsettled issues still remain we propose the following research directions to be considered in the future it would be good to have more in depth understanding of hydrophilic eps compositions water occurrence states and surface charge characteristics during the sludge dewatering process to achieve sludge deep dewatering with economic feasibility it is imperative to accelerate the research and development of the efficient mechanical dewatering devices a promising iron based aops approach towards wider applicability and higher operation effectiveness is thus urgently needed to achieve high sludge dewatering the role of non radicals e g 1o2 and direct electron transfer as well as reaction kinetics of iron based aops are not clear at this stage more direct evidence of dewatering enhancement is required in order to optimize dosage of chemicals and sludge dewatering efficiency the field scale testing and application are still lacking the large scale study can be coupled with deep machine learning technology to provide real time intelligent decision making and continuous optimal control the transformation of typical micropollutants and some emerging pollutants during the treatment should be traced and analyzed the ecotoxicity of their by products would merit to be evaluated more attention could be paid to using more economical feasible and eco friendly approaches for resource recovery from fe containing liquid and solid sludge in summary a more sustainable approach towards high efficient resource recovery in wwtps is required in order to realize the common goals of water waste energy nexus

15951,the increasing amount of sewage sludge produced in wastewater treatment plants wwtps poses a great challenge to both environment and economy globally as a requisite process during sludge treatment sludge dewatering can significantly minimize the sludge volume and lower the operational cost for downstream transportation and disposal iron based advanced oxidation process aop a robust and cost effective technique with relatively low technical barriers for high level sludge dewatering has been widely explored in the past 20 years the development was mainly driven by the demands of efficient and sustainable sludge conditioning technology and the flexible sludge management approaches the application of iron based aops in sludge dewatering process attracts more and more attention

the most common technology in wastewater treatment plants wwtps christensen et al 2015 gherghel et al 2019 wu et al 2020a with the rapid industrialization and urbanization excessive sludge from the process is becoming one of the inevitable challenges to the wwtps and local government schnell et al 2020 it has been estimated that the annual production of sewage sludge in european union was more than 13 0 million ton dry solids ds in 2020 kominko et al 2017 in united states approximately 17 8 million ton of sewage sludge ds is generated from wwtps annually epa 2018 about 0 4 million ton ds of sewage sludge can be produced in australia and new zealand each year drechsel et al 2015 the annual sewage sludge production in china had risen to 13 3 million ton ds in 2020 mohurd 2020 if not being appropriately managed such a large quantity of sewage sludge would pose serious secondary pollution in the worldwide environment cao et al 2021 dewatering as a vital step of sludge treatment can favorably minimize the volume of sludge reduce the operational cost of downstream transportation and disposal and lighten the environmental burden kim et al 2016 yu et al 2016 nevertheless given the high physicochemical binding force between sludge and water it is challenging to separate water from sludge efficiently christensen et al 2015 tremendous efforts have been paid to improve sludge dewaterability through modifying the properties of hydrophilic extracellular polymeric substances eps and destructing the physicochemical binding force between sludge and water xiao et al 2017b yu et al 2021a and b recently advanced oxidation processes aops a promising alternative to conventional coagulation has gained increasing popularity in sludge dewatering process zhen et al 2018 li et al 2019a and 2020a liang et al 2020a and b among various aops the iron based aops attract more and more attention due to its excellent performance in sludge deep dewatering moisture content of sludge 60 wt liu et al 2013a zhang et al 2015 liang et al 2015 yu et al 2016 and 2019a li et al 2020a fig 1 shows the current trend in research publications associated with iron based aops on sludge dewatering in recent five years a rapid upward trend of the relevant publications denotes that the iron based aops become increasingly popular over the past few years some excellent reviews related to sludge dewaterability using different conditioning methods have been published zhou et al 2014a guan et al 2018 liu et al 2018 wei et al 2018 wu et al 2020a cao et al 2021 for example guan et al 2018 summarized the application of h2o2 based aop for sludge dewatering and liu et al 2018 provided a comprehensive overview of so 4 based aop very recently wu et al 2020a and cao et al 2021 analyzed some previously used sludge dewatering technologies and discussed the challenges of various dewatering technologies on subsequent sludge utilization although several reviews have been published previously most of them focused on the comparison of different dewatering technologies e g chemical treatment biological treatment and physical treatment recently iron based aops have seen increasing interest as a promising and efficient dewatering method liu et al 2013a zhang et al 2015 liang et al 2015 however the application of iron based aops on sludge dewatering has never been holistically analyzed so far the mechanisms of iron based aops for sludge dewatering have only been uncovered in recent studies the in depth discussion on the performance factors and the dewatering mechanisms is far scarce additionally the feasibility of reusing treated sludge is unknown thus more attention should be paid to the limitations and challenges of the iron based aops in the sludge conditioning and dewatering processes therefore this work aims to offer a holistic picture of current iron based aops technology for the sludge dewatering with the comprehensive comparison of their advantages and disadvantages it provides the fundamental knowledge of sludge properties and explains the theory of various iron based aops applied in sludge dewatering processes the mechanisms of iron based aops are discussed and the challenges of implementing iron based aops in a large scale application are also highlighted lastly we evaluate the sludge reutilization approaches and propose potential future research directions overall we hope that this review will be equally useful to promote the development of efficient and eco friendly dewatering technology 2 fundamentals of sludge dewatering process 2 1 sludge dewatering barriers sludge including primary sludge activated sludge anaerobic digestion ad sludge and mixed sludge is a semi solid by product from the conventional wwtps sludge flocs has a gel like structure that can host these compounds together via derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo force e g van der waals force wa and electrostatic interaction wr hydrophilic and hydrophobic forces and physical binding force christensen et al 2015 the existence of multiple interaction forces in the flocs would further exacerbate the barriers of separating liquid from sludge solids yu et al 2021a hence more effort is imperative to understand the compositions and characteristics of sludge which may contribute to solve the black box of sludge dewatering generally eps content bound water surface charge particle size and rheological properties are the major parameters reflecting the properties of sludge flocs higgins et al 2004 sheng et al 2010 wu et al 2020a their correlation with the dewaterability of sludge has been well documented zhang et al 2016a xiao et al 2017a li et al 2020a yu et al 2021a and b the main results are summarized as follows 2 1 1 eps eps is a complex macromolecular product from dissolved cell surface matters active secretion and cell lysis it accounts for 70 of the total organic fraction of flocs liu and fang 2003 and occupies both outside of microbial cells and inside of microbial aggregates fig 2 a sheng et al 2010 yu 2020a eps forms a stable net like structure that prevents water escaping from the sludge flocs exhibiting a significant influence on the physicochemical characteristics of sludge flocs such as flocculation settleability and dewaterability neyens et al 2004 d abzac et al 2010 christensen et al 2015 wei et al 2018 li et al 2020a wu et al 2020a over the past two decades tremendous efforts have been focused on the in depth understanding of the relationship between sludge dewaterability and eps it was found out that the eps contents significantly affected the sludge dewaterability and had a positive correlation with sludge dewaterability neyens et al 2004 zhen et al 2012 according to the stratification theory and the shear sensitive characteristics of eps eps from the sludge was divided into three layers namely soluble eps s eps loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps yu et al 2008 and 2010 zhen et al 2013 chen et al 2016a zhang et al 2017a due to the distinguishingly different characteristics of the three eps layers their respective effects on the sludge dewaterability are receiving even more attention chen et al 2016a found that the content of s eps was the main factor affecting sludge dewaterability during calcium peroxide cao2 treatment notwithstanding xiao et al 2017a investigated 20 different types of sludge with various pre treatments and concluded that lb eps played a more considerable role in the sludge dewaterability and filterability compared to s eps and tb eps zhang et al 2022 highlighted that the reduction of tb eps facilitated to the destruction of stable water binding structure of flocs thus resulting in better sludge dewaterability recent studies further investigated the influence of the compositions and functional groups of eps on the sludge dewaterability fig 2b zhen et al 2012 and zhang et al 2016a found that protein like substances in eps were the key determining factor on the sludge dewaterability in the iron based aops treatment via using a three dimensional excitation emission matrix eem xiao et al 2018 and liang et al 2019a found that the water affinity of sludge was determined by the hydrophilic functional groups in eps e g α helix β sheet and random coil in protein secondary structure as well as the n containing functional groups through using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps in the recent study xiao et al 2017b and maqbool et al 2019 used size exclusion chromatography organic carbon detection organic nitrogen detection lc ocd ond to zoom in the predominant components of eps that affect sludge dewaterability results revealed that high contents of low molecular weight lmw proteins and humic substances were associated with low sludge dewaterability notably wu et al 2017 and zhu et al 2020 indicated that tryptophan and lysine in protein could efficiently bind water by the proteomics test furthermore in situ technologies e g scanning electron microscopy sem and confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm were used to analyze the eps morphology xiao et al 2017b xu et al 2018 zhu et al 2020 more recently zhu et al 2020 and xiao et al 2021a found that glycine serine and threonine were the key amino acids worsening sludge dewaterability by adopting high performance liquid chromatography hplc wu et al 2021a and wu et al 2021b analyzed the interactions between water occurrence states and eps and concluded that coagulation treatment could remarkably reduce adherence and viscoelastic properties of eps thus weakening water holding capacity of eps ge et al 2022 and wu et al 2022 applied fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectroscopy ft icr ms to explore the molecular fingerprints of eps results indicated that decomposition of the unsaturated structure units e g cho containing compounds of eps was the key to enhance sludge dewaterability taken together the contents stratifications compositions and functional groups of eps have all been evaluated and correlated with sludge dewaterability although some progress has been made eps is still like a black box that requires in depth understanding in order to fully reveal its relationship with the sludge dewaterability in particular hydrophilic hydrophobic components in the eps and molecular structure of eps associated with the sludge dewaterability should be thoroughly investigated advanced analytical techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy nmr gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms surface enhanced raman spectroscopy and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation qcm d can be employed to unveil more details in the future fig 2b 2 1 2 bound water the moisture content in sludge could be as high as 99 wt vesilind 1994 bound water only accounts for 10 of the total water content in sludge but it cannot be easily removed through mechanical dewatering because of its strongest binding force to sludge flocs wu et al 2020a cao et al 2021 as such the removal of bound water content is considered as the critical step to enhance the solid liquid separation efficiency of sludge recent research has been focused on how to use chemical treatments to improve the bound water removal li et al 2019a found that the bound water content decreased from 2 5 g g total suspended solid tss to 1 9 g g tss after treatment by zero valent iron fe0 combined with persulfate accordingly the sludge dewaterability was significantly promoted as indicated by the greatly reduced moisture content in addition to the above treatments other treatments including in situ crystallization treatment dai et al 2018 thermal treatment zhang et al 2017b ultrasonic treatment zhu et al 2018 and enzymatic lysis treatment wu and chai 2016 have also been used to proficiently remove bound water thus improving the sludge dewaterability it is noteworthy that the commonly used method for measuring the bound water is differential scanning calorimetry dsc lee and lee 1995 he et al 2015 li et al 2019a however this method has certain limitations like long reaction time and the controversial freezing temperature wu et al 2020a to address these issues wu et al 2018 and 2019 applied in situ synchrotron x ray computed microtomography and low field nmr to quantify the bound water in sludge with higher accuracy and convenience in a nutshell in depth understanding of the water occurrence states in sludge would be helpful to optimize the efficiency of sludge conditioning and dewatering 2 1 3 surface charge and particle size it is known that the negative surface charge would hinder the flocs flocculation and reduce the compressibility of sludge based on the dlvo theory kim et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 previous studies found that neutralizing negative surface charge of sludge and decreasing energy barrier of flocs would improve the hydrophobicity and flocculation of sludge thus promoting the solid liquid separation process li et al 2020b and yu et al 2021b indicated a reduction of negative charge could be achieved with fenton fenton like oxidation which is mainly attributed to eps degradation by reactive oxygen species ros and electrostatic neutralization by fe3 fe2 then hydration interaction energy and energy barrier between surface eps and bound water remarkably declined resulting in high hydrophobicity of the surface eps accordingly the sludge dewaterability was improved in our previous study the surface charge of sludge with different chemical treatments was investigated and compared liang et al 2020d despite the changes were detected how these treatments affected the lewis acid base interaction energy electrostatic repulsive interactions energy barrier and the hydrophobicity of sludge remained unknown in the future surface charge characteristics with different treatments should be considered to understand more on sludge dewaterability flocs particle size is another important factor influencing sludge dewaterability wei et al 2018 wu et al 2020a cao et al 2021 it is recognized that supplying chemical flocculants e g fecl3 polyaluminium chloride pac etc increased the particle size of sludge flocs to enlarge the density difference between solid and liquid phases facilitating follow up solid liquid separation process liang et al 2019a and b with respect to fenton fenton like conditioning treatment regulating flocs particle size involves two processes a the generated ros destroys the flocs and then reduces its particle size leading to flocs dispersion and water release ge et al 2020 b the released fe3 fe2 reassembles the dissociative flocs and then increases its particle size thus reducing the sludge viscosity li et al 2020a however there is no data directly reflecting the respective contributions of ros and fe3 fe2 to flocs particle size regulation therefore there is a need for quantitative determination of the suitable flocs particle size for satisfied sludge dewaterability 2 1 4 rheological properties rheology properties of sludge is generally applied to characterize the internal structure strength of flocs which reflects viscosity flowability and solid liquid separation efficiency of sludge li et al 2020a wu et al 2020a previous studies found that effective reduction of viscosity and water holding capacity of sludge could enhance sludge dewaterability xiao et al 2017b ge et al 2020 liang et al 2020b li et al 2020a and b and liang et al 2020a and b reported that the iron based aops could efficiently reduce the viscosity network strength and water holding capacity of sludge leading to high flowability and dewaterability of sludge despite some studies have preliminarily analyzed the relationship between rheology behavior and dewaterability most of them only focus on a single treatment therefore it is crucial to advance our understanding of fundamental relationships between rheology behavior and dewaterability with different conditioning treatments 2 2 types of mechanical dewatering devices mechanical dewatering process is often selected for sludge treatment wakeman 2007 mobaraki et al 2018 based on the source of applied force mechanical dewatering processes are divided into three types e g centrifuges belt presses and plate filter presses mowla et al 2013 the centrifuges and belt presses are more popular in wwtps owing to their simple and flexible operation procedure and low capital cost while the application of the plate filter presses would be restricted by the high capital and operating cost mobaraki et al 2018 different dewatering devices would directly affect the sludge dewatering efficiency pan et al 2003 generally the moisture content of sludge cake would be around 80 wt 75 wt and 65 wt with the dewatering by centrifuge belt press and plate filter press respectively pan et al 2003 mowla et al 2013 of note the above dewatering devices would not be able to further reduce the moisture content of sludge cake owing to the pressure limits of mechanical dewatering further reduction would require assistance of other chemical treatment furthermore such moisture content 65 wt can no longer meet the strict regulations from many government agencies rao et al 2021 this would require the further development of the highly efficient dewatering devices to tackle the challenges and further lower the moisture content of sludge liang et al 2015 and 2020c used the ultrahigh pressure filter press compressed pressure of 1 0 6 0 mpa to compress and dewater the sludge conditioned by fenton treatment results showed that under the compressed pressure of 6 0 mpa the moisture content of treated sludge would decrease to 50 wt furthermore mahmoud et al 2016 guo et al 2018 and rao et al 2021 reported that the pressurized electro dewatering devices could efficiently reduce the bound water content and the moisture content of sludge with low power consumption mobaraki et al 2018 showed that the high power ultrasound combined with vacuum filter system could favorably increase the total solid of sludge cake by 12 as compared with the vacuum filter system these results indicate the advance dewatering devices could effectively remove the bound water and realize high efficiency sludge dewatering nevertheless whether aops conditioning combined with these prospective dewatering devices can further reduce the moisture content requires detailed investigation through long term field trials in the future 3 fundamentals of iron based aops 3 1 homogeneous iron based aops system fenton system has existed for more than 100 years and been developed into different applications luo et al 2021 fenton system relies on chemical reactions of fe2 and h2o2 neyens and baeyens 2003 neyens et al 2004 which generate ros e g hydroxyl radical ho hydroperoxy radical ho2 and superoxide radical o 2 via chain reactions babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 three main chain reactions include a chain initiation eqs 1 3 b chain transfer eqs 4 7 and c chain termination eqs 8 10 babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 zhu et al 2019 in fenton reaction the generated fe3 eq 2 and chain transfer reactions eq 4 7 are recognized as the rate limiting steps in this system due to the consumption of h2o2 and ho luo et al 2021 1 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 ho o h 2 f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e 2 ho 2 h 3 ho 2 o 2 h 4 ho h 2 o 2 ho 2 h 2 o 5 ho h 2 o 2 o 2 h 2 o 6 ho r r h 2 o 7 o 2 r r o 2 8 r r r r 9 ho 2 ho 2 o 2 h 2 o 10 ho 2 ho o 2 h 2 o according to the chain reactions of fenton system fenton reaction efficiency is affected by the operating conditions such as ph h2o2 concentration fe2 concentration and temperature hodges et al 2018 fenton system is known for its simple and flexible operation as well as high organics degradation efficiency neyens and baeyens 2003 however the extreme acidic condition ph 3 0 wastage of oxidants and production of iron contained sludge may lead to high operating cost benatti et al 2009 hodges et al 2018 therefore the development of cost effective and highly efficient fenton system at around neutral ph is deemed necessary recently persulfate based fenton like systems have been introduced to allow the reaction occurring in a broader ph range 3 0 10 0 higher redox potential 2 5 3 1 ev and longer life span 30 40 μs ahmed et al 2012 peroxydisulfate pds and peroxymonosulfate pms are commonly used for generating so 4 zhou et al 2018 in contrast to pds pms is a more promising oxidant for micropollutants removal in wastewater due to its short bond length 1 46 å and nontoxic degradation byproducts wacławek et al 2017 breaking down the o o bond is the important step to produce so 4 from pds or pms matzek and carter 2016 various approaches including physical methods e g heat ultrasound and ultraviolet zhou et al 2018 luo et al 2021 and chemical methods e g alkali ozone and transition metals wang and wang 2018 have been developed for pds or pms activation among them fe2 is one of the efficient catalysts to activate pds or pms due to its convenient operation low cost and environmental friendly properties nfodzo and choi 2011 liu et al 2018 as shown in eq 11 fe2 donates an electron to pds and activates it liu et al 2018 fe2 can also react with pms to produce the active radicals e g ho and so 4 eqs 12 and 13 rastogi et al 2009 according to xiao et al 2020 reaction conditions including ph temperature fe2 dosage and pds pms dosages would affect the reaction efficiency it is known that fe2 pds pms would work in a wide ph range from 3 0 to 10 0 but the neutral ph would increase iron precipitation and thus lower the reaction efficiency giannakis et al 2016 to avoid the iron precipitation the ph of these systems should be set to acidic condition ph 5 0 xiao et al 2020 higher fe2 pds or pms dosage could promote so 4 production thus enhancing the micropollutants degradation in wastewater wacławek et al 2017 however the excessive fe2 and persulfate would also induce the quenching effects on so 4 and in turn hinder the reaction efficiency eqs 14 16 volpe et al 2013 xiao et al 2020 thus it is worthy to investigate the effects of dosage threshold on the activation of pds or pms in the fenton like system 11 f e 2 s 2 o 8 2 f e 3 so 4 so 4 2 12 f

above although homogenous iron based aops can successfully remove target contaminants via reactive radicals these technologies still face several inevitable challenges such as unstable activation efficiency uncontrollable radical formation rate and a notable quenching effect of oxidants and activators which would lead to low production of ros and thereby restrict the reaction efficiency zhou et al 2018 thus the heterogeneous iron based aops system has received greater attention chen et al 2014 notably iron based materials including fe0 iron oxides e g magnetite fe3o4 and goethite iron minerals e g pyrite siderite etc and synthetic loaded iron based materials are generally considered as competitive heterogeneous iron based aops catalysts owing to their low toxicity effective catalytic activity and high recovery efficiency fu et al 2014 rahim pouran et al 2015 luo et al 2021 fe0 a commonly used heterogeneous catalyst can effectively react with oxidants and generate reactive radicals due to its strong reducibility e0 fe2 fe0 0 447 v fu et al 2014 xiao et al 2020 fe0 based aops reactions can be divided into two stages a induction stage eqs 17 21 xu and wang 2011 wang et al 2020a and b rapid reaction stage eqs 1 11 and 12 oh et al 2016 kim et al 2018 after these two processes iron cycle could be occurred eq 22 further facilitating ros generation xiao et al 2020 however in these fe0 based aops systems the iron oxide e g fe3o4 and lepidocrocite γ feooh are formed and covers the fe0 surface causing low fe2 dissolution rate and limiting mass transfer rate guan et al 2015 in order to remove the passive layer of fe0 various pretreatments of fe0 have been investigated in recent years such as thermal pretreatment acid washing pretreatment ultrasonic pretreatment and pre magnetization pretreatment sun et al 2016 in addition the fe2 dissolution rate and mass transfer rate of reaction are also dependent on the particle size of fe0 thomas et al 2021 the smaller particle size of fe0 contains larger specific surface area and stronger reactivity which is in favor of rapid reaction with oxidants in this light nanoscale iron oxides iron minerals and synthetic loaded iron based materials could also be regarded as the effective iron based catalyst xiao et al 2020 generally characteristics of iron based materials are greatly determined by their synthesis methods the common synthesis methods include chemical co precipitation solvothermal procedure hydrothermal calcination borohydride reduction pyrolysis and etc thomas et al 2021 although these approaches are all available a simple and eco friendly method should be selected for large scale synthesis in order to minimize the preparation cost as mentioned above the iron based materials oxidants as competitive heterogeneous iron based aops systems could boost fe2 regeneration and fe3 fe2 cycle resulting in continuous ros generation these ros could proficiently remove the hydrophilic eps and improve the sludge dewaterability nevertheless a deep insight into such heterogeneous iron based aops systems in sludge dewatering process especially the fate of iron species is still lacking

art of the iron based aops for sludge conditioning as discussed previously sludge has poor compressibility strong hydrophilic properties and high levels of bound water which pose great challenges to separate water from the solids christensen et al 2015 currently the iron based aops have been recognized as a promising method to improve the sludge dewaterability because these methods can successfully remove the hydrophilic eps and promote the bound water release zhang et al 2015 xiao et al 2018 zhen et al 2018 liang et al 2020a and b according to the iron types the iron based aops for sludge conditioning can be mainly categorized as homogeneous iron based aops fe0 based aops ferrate based aops and electrolysis iron based aops which would be discussed in detail 4 1 homogeneous iron based aops homogeneous iron based aops could destroy the flocs structure and induce the release of eps and bound water from sludge fig 3 a yu et al 2016 guan et al 2018 thus realizing high sludge dewaterability table 1 the homogeneous iron based aops for sludge conditioning were implemented as early as 2003 when the first attempt of fenton system was conducted by lu et al 2003 this study found that the sludge dewaterability was significantly enhanced with the fenton treatment as indicated by the srf reduction of 90 0 under the optimal condition initial ph 3 0 fe2 dosage 6000 mg l h2o2 dosage 3000 mg l and reaction time 30 min the fenton reaction conditions for sludge treatment were later optimized by some researchers buyukkamaci 2004 neyens et al 2004 tony et al 2008 they concluded that initial ph fe2 concentration h2o2 concentration and reaction time all had the remarkable impacts on the sludge conditioning performance more effective sludge dewaterability could be achieved under the optimized conditions leading to a 50 reduction in capillary suction time cst buyukkamaci 2004 tony et al 2008 the method was also demonstrated at the pilot scale liu et al 2013a zhang et al 2015 liang et al 2015 for example liu et al 2013a using 50 0 l sludge volume concluded that the moisture content of sludge cake was as low as 49 5 wt at the initial ph of 5 0 fe2 concentration of 33 8 mg g ds h2o2 concentration of 40 3 mg g ds portland cement concentration of 349 9 mg g ds lime concentration of 500 0 mg g ds and reaction time of 60 min liang et al 2015 and zhang et al 2015 also showed that the moisture content of sludge cake was 60 wt under the optimum conditions of a fenton system treating 100 l sludge according to the abovementioned studies low ph ph 5 0 is a prerequisite of fenton reaction for excellent sludge dewaterability nevertheless acidification would complicate the conditioning procedure and increase the operation cost due to the downstream neutralization process masihi and gholikandi 2018 liang et al 2020b to solve this problem yu et al 2016 investigated the feasibility of fenton reaction for sludge deep dewatering at neutral ph the authors concluded that fenton treatment without adjustment of ph ph 6 7 could also effectively improve the sludge dewaterability moisture content of sludge cake 55 8 wt and the estimated cost of this fenton process was more economical over the conventional fecl3 cao treatment usd 43 8 ton ds vs usd 54 0 ton ds the effectiveness of fenton treatment for sludge dewatering was ascribed to the efficient removal of hydrophilic eps by ho oxidation and flocs recombination by fe3 flocculation notwithstanding it should be pointed out that such promising fenton process is deserved to be further demonstrated in the larger scale in order to evaluate its costs iron sludge production and utilization of sludge cake and filtrate compared to the conventional fenton system homogeneous iron based so 4 aops have received more attention table 1 because of its multiple benefits such as wider effective ph range 3 0 10 0 higher oxidizing potential 2 5 3 1 ev and stable oxidation efficiency zhen et al 2012 alexopoulou et al 2019 the homogeneous iron based so 4 aops were firstly performed by zhen et al 2012 who reported a desirable sludge dewaterability at a neutral ph cst reduction by 88 8 the optimized conditions were fe2 dosage of 1 5 mm g volatile suspend solid vss pds dosage of 1 2 mm g vss at conditioning time of 1 min the study displayed that so 4 generated from fe2 and pds reactions could effectively decompose the soluble eps and reduce viscosity leading to bound water release and improved dewaterability shi et al 2015 and song et al 2016 also concluded that fe2 and pds treatment was a feasible method for achieving sludge deep dewatering moisture content of sludge cake 60 wt cst reduction 90 moreover fe2 and pms treatment was also investigated to facilitate sludge dewaterability liu et al 2016 reported the srf reduction of 97 0 and cst reduction of 90 0 at neutral ph xiao et al 2017b and guo and zhou 2020 proposed that fe2 and pms treatment decomposed refractory and sticky biopolymers e g lmw proteins and polysaccharides as well as the internal backbone at neutral ph the iron based so 4 aops has a competitive advantage over the fenton treatments for sludge dewatering a possible reason for this is that homogeneous iron based so 4 aops could generate abundant ho and so 4 to remarkably remove the hydrophilic biopolymers in lb eps and tb eps and facilitate the bound water release under neutral conditions fig 3b however the overdose of pds pms or fe2 was not conducive to sludge dewatering due to the undesirable consumption of so 4 via quenching reactions eqs 14 16 volpe et al 2013 together although homogeneous iron based so 4 aops to certain extent can achieve high level sludge dewaterability at neutral ph it is worth noting that the residual sulfate ions generated from the treatment processes and the high cost of pds and pms pds 1100 usd ton pms 1300 usd ton should be taken into consideration in the large scale application shi et al 2015 liu et al 2016 song et al 2016 li et al 2020a in recent five years in order to find a stable and economical alternative to h2o2 pds pms several promising oxidants e g peracetic acid paa cao2 calcium hypochlorite ca clo 2 sodium percarbonate sp na2co3 1 5h2o2 and sodium sulfite na2so3 that are commonly applied in wastewater treatment have been studied for sludge conditioning table 1 wang et al 2015 wu and chai 2016 yu et al 2019a li et al 2020a ai et al 2021 it was found that 3000 mg fe2 l and 100 mg paa g tss could reduce srf by 90 0 wang et al 2015 0 625 mmol fe2 g tss and 50 mg cao2 g tss reduced srf and cst by 92 6 and 85 7 respectively wu and chai 2016 which were comparable to the fenton system yu et al 2016 yu et al 2019a reported that fe2 ca clo 2 treatment could simultaneously achieve sludge deep dewatering and total coliforms inactivation posing more competitive advantages over fenton system li et al 2020a and ai et al 2021 concluded that fe2 sp treatment and fe2 na2so3 treatment favorably improved the sludge dewatering and were more economically attractive for future applications as compared to the fe2 h2o2 pds pms treatments zhang et al 2015 liu et al 2016 these fe2 promising oxidants could become a feasible technology for upgrading sludge dewaterability through remarkable cell lysis intracellular sticky organics release and bound water reduction the improved sludge dewaterability is likely owing to the formation of stronger ros e g ho so 4 so 3 o 2 chlorine free radicals carbon centered radicals fe iv reactive intermediate species and etc from fe2 promising oxidants kim et al 2019 ai et al 2021 cao et al 2021 however the specific roles of the such different ros on the sludge dewaterability require further study apart from the abovementioned homogeneous iron based aops fenton like systems e g fe3 h2o2 and organic acids cleated fe2 oxidants are also viable to enhance the sludge dewatering via facilitating iron cycle for more ros production table 1 tony et al 2011 he et al 2015 and 2017 wang et al 2019 yang et al 2021a however it is of note their dewatering efficiency and economic viabilities are unclear at this stage 4 2 fe0 and iron minerals based aops over the last decade fe0 based aops is one of the heterogeneous aops that has been extensively used to improve sludge dewaterability table 2 such method can minimize the chemical dosages and avoid iron sludge accumulation fe0 is a cost effective and eco friendly iron source fu et al 2014 zhou et al 2014b 2015 and 2017 yu et al 2019b liang et al 2020a zhou et al 2014b 2015 and 2017 mentioned that fe0 combined with commonly used oxidants e g h2o2 pds and pms could be a potential alternative to conventional fenton treatment yu et al 2019b showed that cst and srf was reduced by 81 8 and 41 9 respectively with fe0 ozonation treatment liang et al 2020a and liu et al 2021 applied fe0 potassium permanganate kmno4 treatment and fe0 na2so3 treatment respectively to condition sludge and found that the moisture content of sludge cake decreased to 70 wt after treatments the inconsistent effect of fe0 oxidants on sludge dewaterability may be related to the fe dissolution liang et al 2020a noticeably fe0 based aops treatment could save 20 40 of operating cost over the homogeneous iron based aops zhou et al 2015 liang et al 2020a liu et al 2021 mainly due to reusability of fe0 although the fe0 based aops treatment exhibits economic advantages this approach also faces some unavoidable challenges including unsatisfied dewatering efficiency and low fe0 utilization efficiency which may limit its future application liang et al 2020a to tackle these issues several studies have attempted to use physical methods to enhance the efficiency li et al 2018 successfully combined thermal treatment with fe0 pms to improve sludge dewaterability moisture content of sludge cake 66 0 wt liu et al 2020 reported that cst reduction and moisture content was 89 2 and 67 9 wt with ultrasound fe0 pms treatment these physical treatments assisted approaches could facilitate the production of highly active radicals ho and so 4 thereby efficiently decrease negative charge on the surface of sludge and remove the hydrophilic eps so as to enhance sludge flowability and solid liquid separation efficiency our previous studies applied thermal acid pretreatment and ultrasound thermal acid pretreatment to remove the passive layer of fe0 and further accelerated the iron release rate and fe0 reaction efficiency liang et al 2020a and c fig 4 a accordingly moisture content of sludge cake was 55 wt with the pretreated fe0 oxidants conditioning method meanwhile the excellent performance could be maintained for more than 10 continuous cycles exhibiting the superiority of this system recently the complexation agents e g humic acid ha and nitrilotriacetic acid nta were introduced into fe0 oxidant system which could facilitate the production of highly active radicals and further boost the sludge dewaterability hao et al 2018 liang et al 2020b a possible reason for this is that the addition of ha and nta could facilitate fe dissolution and form chelated soluble fe2 species these chelated species upon exposed to air would be instantly oxidized through fenton like reaction forming chelated soluble fe3 species which could be promptly reduced to fe2 via electrons transfer from fe0 such iron cycle could finally promote oxidants decomposition to generate highly active radicals li et al 2019b overall although the advances of fe0 based aops are well recognized in the field of sludge dewatering several issues should be resolved such as fe0 agglomeration low fe0 mass transport efficiency and low fe0 utilization efficiency compared to fe0 iron rich mineral is a cheaper and more stable iron source which has been chosen to activate the oxidants for degradation of micropollutants in wastewater chen et al 2014 feng et al 2018 recently liu 2019 li et al 2021 and liang et al 2021 evaluated the feasibility of using iron rich mineral based aops to improve the sludge dewaterability they found that vanadium titanium magnetite vtm pms siderite pms and pyrite pms treatments exhibited a great potential for enhancing sludge dewaterability and these systems could constantly release highly active radicals to remove the hydrophilic eps and improve the flowability it should be emphasized that tao et al 2019 combined fe rich biochar from fenton treated sludge with oxidants to condition the sludge and achieved moisture content of sludge cake of 46 4 wt fig 4b likewise xiao et al 2021b prepared a sludge derived biochar loaded with mnfe2o4 mnfe2o4 sbc to catalyze ozonation that was used for enhancing sludge dewaterability the promotion of sludge dewaterability in the iron rich mineral based aops could be because the iron rich mineral enhanced the fe3 fe2 cycle in aops and offered sufficient fe2 to react with oxidants for ros production luo et al 2021 as such this environment friendly sludge dewatering approach deserves to be investigated further as mentioned above the characteristics of iron rich mineral are largely influenced by their synthesis methods and the particle size which should be optimized before application 4 3 ferrate based aops ferrate as a high valent iron has been adopted in wastewater treatment as it can serve as a strong oxidizer and coagulant jiang 2014 ferrate has recently been applied in the sludge conditioning as well zhang et al 2012 and 2016b wu et al 2020b zhang et al 2012 reported that ferrate could potentially enhance the sludge dewaterability at the ferrate dosage of 1000 mg l and ph of 3 0 accordingly the srf and moisture content of sludge was reduced by 30 5 and 12 5 respectively zhang et al 2016b also found that under the strong acidic condition ph 4 0 the srf was reduced by 90 at ferrate dosage of 100 mg g tss wu et al 2020b found that the ferrate treatment could remarkably improve the sludge dewaterability as indicated by a srf reduction of 50 the working mechanism of ferrate in sludge conditioning has been proposed first ferrate solubilizes the protein like substrate in the eps layers and liberates the bound water through oxidation process second fe3 from ferrate re flocculates the dissociative flocs and eps thus leading to the formation of porous structure and dewatering channel zhang et al 2016b as such the sludge changes to the low viscosity of gel like matters and facilitates the solid water separation process via the mechanical dewatering in this process iron valence state in ferrate served as an important role which deserved to further investigate despite the ferrate treatment promotes sludge dewaterability with noticeable environmental benefits the implementation of ferrate treatment in sludge conditioning process is still challenging due to the low stability of ferrate complicate preparation process of ferrate unsatisfied dewatering efficiency and strong acidic condition more efforts are required to overcome these challenges 4 4 electro iron based aops so far electro iron based aops in sludge conditioning have received great attention due to their high efficiency and low chemicals consumption masihi and gholikandi 2018 in the electro iron based aops iron based materials could possess two functions namely catalyst and electrode luo et al 2021 for example fe2 was used as catalyst in the electro fenton like system for improving sludge dewaterability in which the anode and cathode were ti ruo2 meshes respectively zhen et al 2013 this combined system achieved 90 dewatering efficiency indicating the effectiveness of this treatment moreover a combination of electrolysis and fe2 pds method consumed 60 less chemicals than the fe2 pds method zhen et al 2012 when achieving similar srf reduction likewise masihi and gholikandi 2018 cai et al 2019 and chen et al 2019 also demonstrated the effectiveness and stability of electro fenton process for enhancing sludge dewaterability where the iron based materials acted as catalyst the possible reason is that these systems can facilitate the redox cycle of iron ions via molecular oxygen activation on the cathode hu et al 2018 then more ros were generated via the combination of fenton fenton like reaction and anodic oxidation in the electro fenton system luo et al 2021 thus conducing to high removal of lb eps and tb eps in addition li et al 2016 applied fe0 as electrode in the electro iron based aops for sludge dewatering results indicated that the electrolysis fe0 pds treatment significantly reduced the srf and cst by 87 4 and 49 1 respectively in this system sufficient fe2 could be generated from sacrificial iron anode and fe3 fe2 cycle could be accelerated after supplying electrons from electrode luo et al 2021 more fe2 released in the system could efficiently activate oxidants to destroy sludge flocs and remove hydrophilic eps leading to effective sludge dewaterability in the electro iron based aops system the applied voltage is the crucial operating condition influencing the conversion rates of fe3 to fe2 and then affecting the sludge dewaterability hu et al 2018 the remarkable improvement of sludge dewaterability by electro iron based aops with increasing the current applied can be attributed to the efficient activation of oxidants by released fe2 li et al 2016 in addition to the applied voltage the operational conditions e g ph reaction times and chemical dosages would also affect the iron transformation which should be further investigated in the system the main challenges of the electro fenton fenton like systems are high energy consumption and the corrosion of electrode wu et al 2020a which would increase the operational cost and hinder its utilization very recently wang et al 2021b indicated that imposing electric field on the iron based aops not only boosted the ros generation via accelerating the iron cycle but also induced in situ generation of h2o2 through reducing oxygen such reagent free technologies could further save the storage space of chemicals and reduce the construction cost in practical application however high energy cost and the electrode corrosion should not be ignored 4 5 factors influencing the performance of iron based aops in the sludge conditioning process given the sensitive reaction conditions of iron based aops and the complex sludge composition various reaction factors and environmental factors that affect sludge dewaterability should be fully understood as such the reaction conditions of iron based aops e g initial ph dosages of iron and oxidants temperature and reaction time buyukkamaci 2004 liu et al 2013a babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 and the environmental factors e g sludge types organic matter contents eps contents and microbiome liang et al 2015 wu et al 2020a are discussed in this section the initial ph of iron based aops is regarded as an important reaction condition in the sludge dewatering process zhang et al 2015 and 2016b masihi and gholikandi 2018 it would directly influence the reaction efficiency and the ros generation thomas et al 2021 iron based aops usually exhibit ph dependent performance it is generally accepted that acidic condition ph 5 0 is a requisite factor of the fenton fenton like treatments as low ph promotes the reaction efficiency and ros production for example the most effective performance was found at ph of 3 0 in the fenton fenton like treatments moisture content of sludge cake 60 0 wt liang et al 2015 and 2020a li et al 2020a higher ph worsened the fenton fenton like treatment performance due to the insufficient oxidizing capability zhang et al 2015 impressively the so 4 based aops could efficiently work at wider ph range 3 0 ph 8 0 liu et al 2020 zhen et al 2012 and guo and zhou 2020 pointed out that cst reduction was higher than 88 after so 4 based aops treatment at neutral ph confirming the effectiveness of the method accordingly downstream acidification and neutralization are no longer needed in such treatment which could simplify the process and save the operational cost in addition the so 4 based aops treatment was also demonstrated in ad sludge dewatering process without ph adjustment wang et al 2019 liu et al 2020 and 2021 the dosages of iron and oxidants in the iron based aops have remarkable impacts on the sludge dewaterability since they would directly affect the overall reaction liu et al 2018 wu et al 2020a thomas et al 2021 it is known that increasing the iron or oxidants dosage would increase the sludge dewaterability but the performance may deteriorate if iron or oxidants are overdosed song et al 2016 masihi and gholikandi 2018 zhen et al 2018 liang et al 2020a hence the dosage of iron and oxidants needs to be optimized to minimize the operating cost and achieve the highest sludge dewaterability temperature also plays a crucial role in the iron based aops reaction because it influences the iron dissolution and catalytic efficiency in the reaction li et al 2018 thomas et al 2021 previous studies reported that increasing temperature could improve the reactive radical generation thus promoting sludge dewaterability xiao et al 2017c li et al 2018 liang et al 2020a although the thermal treatment induced high sludge dewaterability these thermal iron based aops suffer from the issues such as high energy consumption and high operational cost leading to its limited application in fact waste heat in wwtps can be employed to lower the energy consumption reaction time would also have a considerable effect on the sludge dewaterability buyukkamaci 2004 liang et al 2015 chen et al 2019 guo and zhou 2020 chen et al 2019 mentioned that the optimal reaction time was observed to be 40 min with the electro fenton treatment longer time may result in the over oxidation effect and worsen sludge dewaterability likewise in the fe2 pms treatment with the extension of reaction time sludge dewaterability gradually decreased guo and zhou 2020 it is known that shortening the reaction time can reduce the volume of conditioning tank in practice leading to lower capital cost accordingly the optimal reaction time can be investigated before the implementation besides the reaction conditions the environmental factors would also have a considerable impact christensen et al 2015 liang et al 2015 skinner et al 2015 wang et al 2020b the types of sludge would directly affect iron based aop conditioning processes as the ad sludge characteristics particularly eps components were far complex from that of waste activated sludge was xiao et al 2017a cao et al 2021 compared to was the ad sludge dewaterability was poorer owing to its higher content of colloidal biopolymers e g high molecular weight polycyclic steroid like substances and aromatic compounds and low molecular weight protein and higher viscosity lu et al 2018 li et al 2019a such large amounts of refractory biopolymers would scavenge ros and thus reduce the iron based aop conditioning efficiency high organic content is one of the barriers for sludge dewatering as high organic content sludge generally contains high eps content bound water content negative zeta potential as well as strong network strength resulting in worse aggregation and flocculation liang et al 2015 skinner et al 2015 wang et al 2020b liang et al 2015 noted that higher organic content of sludge consumed more chemicals and required longer reaction time to achieve acceptable sludge dewaterability note that the changes in microbial community especially gathering the organics degrading bacteria would stimulate the decrease of hydrophilic eps components and enhance the sludge dewaterability thus further affect the processing efficiency liang et al 2022 the dissolved organic matters dom microbial secretion multiple heavy metals various anions and hydrophilic micropollutants in the sludge rehman et al 2018 usually also consume the reactive radicals and further restrict the reaction efficiency zhou et al 2018 to date few studies considered the effects of these environmental factors on the iron based aops during the conditioning and dewatering process collectively it is imperative to further study the environmental factors affecting the sludge dewaterability to speed up its future applications 4 6 process adaptability of the iron based aops for sludge conditioning according to the above mentioned studies the iron based aops have been recognized as the promising and efficient approach to achieve sludge deep dewatering however the environmental factors particularly types of sludge e g was and ad sludge would notably influence the dewatering efficiency in the iron based aops in order to maximize sludge dewaterability and minimize operational costs different sludge would require different measures fenton treatment fe2 combined with paa cao2 ca clo 2 sp treatment and ferrate based aops could be preferentially utilized in was dewatering as these methods could rapidly remove the hydrophilic biopolymers and then enhance the sludge dewaterability via strong oxidation ability with low cost and high benefit given the high alkalinity and large amounts of refractory biopolymers in ad sludge iron based so 4 aops complexation agents fe0 based aops and electro iron based aops would be the preferable and economical options as they could effectively destroy the refractory biopolymers and further promote the sludge dewatering without ph adjustment note that it is of important significance to select an optimal iron based aops method to achieve the desired outcome with high flexibility among the iron based aops treatment iron based so 4 aops and electro iron based aops could become the feasible and promising choices to achieve sludge deep dewatering owing to their wider applicability and higher operation effectiveness which is better suited to future practical application towards economic benefits accordingly further long term investigation is required to evaluate their pros and cons 5 mechanisms and challenges 5 1 sludge dewatering mechanisms the underlying mechanisms of the iron based aops are generally divided into two steps a oxidation step and b flocculation step fig 5 a in the oxidation step highly ros are generated from the iron based aops which could effectively destroy the flocs structure and microbial cell structure accordingly the hydrophilic substances e g tyrosine like proteins tryptophan like proteins fulvic acid like materials and humic acid like substances and the sticky biopolymers e g high molecular weight hmw proteins hmw polysaccharides lmw proteins and lmw polysaccharides in the lb eps and tb eps could be significantly removed resulting in the release of intracellular water xiao et al 2017a zhang et al 2019 liang et al 2020b meanwhile these ros also induce the destruction of the hydrophilic functional groups e g c o stretch ch cn stretch and c o symmetric stretching associated with proteins coh and co associated with polysaccharides the secondary structure of protein molecules e g β sheet and α helix n containing bond and hydrophilic amino acid in the lb eps and tb eps thus further decreasing the particle size hydrophilicity and viscosity of sludge li et al 2020a ai et al 2021 xiao et al 2021a in the flocculation step the iron flocs from the iron based aops could efficiently flocculate the dissociative flocs and eps through energy barrier reduction and charge neutralization which is conducive to the increment in flowability and hydrophobicity of sludge yu et al 2021a as such the sludge dewaterability is enhanced it should be pointed out that despite the oxidation and flocculation steps are recognized as the main sludge dewatering mechanisms it is still not conclusive which step is the key to improve sludge dewaterability to identify the contribution of the two steps radical species were quenched and the results indicated that the main factor contributing to the enhancement of sludge dewaterability was the oxidation step li et al 2019a liu et al 2020 however some studied also proved the flocculation was the dominant step liang et al 2020b and c therefore more efforts are required to illustrate these contradictory results additionally it is also unclear whether these two steps occur simultaneously or sequentially which merits further investigation in terms of the oxidation degree of eps in the iron based aops two mechanisms were proposed namely excessive oxidation and moderate oxidation fig 5b yu et al 2019a and 2021b in the excessive oxidation process more reactive radicals are available that degrade more hydrophobic eps and produce smaller particle size of sludge accordingly the hydrophilicity hydration interaction energy and energy barrier of sludge flocs are significantly enhanced thus increasing the repulsive interactions between sludge flocs and bound water content in the moderate oxidation process hydrophobic eps would not be drastically destroyed a great mass of hydrophobic eps layer retains which facilitates the release of bound water taken together maintaining the hydrophobic eps of sludge at appropriate amount is the most important step for the improvement of sludge dewaterability such information however is very limited so far 5 2 limitations and challenges as stated previously four major issues concerning the iron based aops in sludge dewatering process were discussed e g long pretreatment time high dosages of chemicals high operational cost and prerequisite acid conditions some other challenges are further discussed in this section it is known that many factors including composition of influent in wwtps sewage treatment technology and seasonal changes in temperature would greatly affect sludge characteristics thus causing remarkable changes in the eps composition and sludge dewaterability christensen et al 2015 yang et al 2015 cao et al 2021 owing to the complicated sludge characteristics how to choose a suitable iron based aops towards economic benefits and operation effectiveness is still enormously challenged liang et al 2015 yu et al 2017 and wang et al 2020b used linear modeling technique to develop the correlation between sludge organic fraction and its dewaterability and offered a selection method for high level sludge dewatering optimization nevertheless due to the underrepresentation of samples and the limitation of linear model the selection of methods and the operation conditions should be further optimized deep machine learning technology e g artificial neural networks ann random forest decision trees and etc as an advanced tool in environmental engineering could be utilized to achieve such purpose in the sludge dewatering process also based on large data sets real time intelligent decision making and continuous optimal control strategies could be realized and the relevant trends could be predicted in the future zhong et al 2021 in addition to the sludge characteristics the decision should also be made based on the final management of sludge e g resource recovery or disposal as the iron based aops are rapidly progressing in sludge dewatering area fig 1 yu et al 2019b chen et al 2019 li et al 2020a it is crucial to clearly understand the fundamental mechanisms of these processes numerous studies traced the changes in physicochemical characteristics of sludge e g eps content zeta potential particle size bound water rheological properties hydrophilicity hydrophobicity and electrical repulsive force to elucidate the potential dewatering mechanisms by iron based aops treatment yu et al 2016 zhen et al 2018 li et al 2019a liu et al 2020 liang et al 2020a but the direct evidence is still lacking the changes in the water holding capacities of flocs water solid interface behavior and binding force between water and eps proteins can be studied further through the in situ visualization methods e g in situ synchrotron x ray computed microtomography and low field nmr the impacts of different types of amino acids on sludge dewaterability should merit to be investigated molecular insight into the binding property between water and amino acids is worthy of exploration as well in addition the study on mechanistic chemical reactions involved in the iron based aops can be carried out in depth thomas et al 2021 demonstrated that density functional theory dft can be used to understand the roles of catalytic activity in the iron based aops reactions the findings would promote the optimization of catalyst performance and reaction efficiency moreover extensive studies demonstrated the reactive radicals e g ho so 4 and o 2 generation in the iron based aops was the main mechanism of sludge dewatering li et al 2019a and 2020a liu et al 2020 nevertheless the non radicals e g 1o2 and high valent iron probably participate in changing sludge dewaterability as well owing to their oxidation capacity lee et al 2020 in the future the contribution of these non radicals is also a valuable research direction for the underlying dewatering mechanism noticeably the iron valence state has a significant influence on the overall reaction so the variations in the iron valence state during the iron based aops process should be tracked via tracing x ray absorption spectroscopy xas or xps thomas et al 2021 taken together the in depth understanding of the dewatering mechanisms would be beneficial to optimize chemicals consumption and operating conditions previous studies reported that a broad spectrum of micropollutants e g pharmaceuticals personal care products biocides and antibiotics and many other emerging pollutants e g microplastics antibiotic resistant genes args perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos have been extensively detected in sludge yang et al 2013 zareitalabad et al 2013 gulde et al 2016 mahon et al 2017 yu et al 2020b which receives rising concerns in the downstream sludge treatment as such efficient pre treatment is necessary to remove them before downstream sludge treatment previous studies reported that the iron based aops treatment could potentially achieve such goal during sludge dewatering process in our previous study triclosan removal efficiency was 35 in the pyrite pms treatment process liang et al 2021 lu et al 2020 and zhang et al 2022 indicated that the ho and so 4 produced from iron based aops could simultaneously enhance sludge dewaterability and args removal nevertheless in the light of the complicated nature and the extensive spectrum of micropollutants emerging pollutants it is not easy to resolve all issues in the iron based aops dewatering process besides some of the contaminants in sludge may be transformed or degraded during the iron based aops treatment more toxic by products might be generated as well additionally various functional groups such as carboxyl and amino groups in eps provide abundant binding sites for contaminants sheng et al 2010 liang et al 2021 during the sludge conditioning process the highly reactive radicals generated from iron based aops may inevitably contact with the contaminants bound with eps nevertheless whether the highly reactive radicals directly degrade contaminants bound with eps or destroy the binding bond between contaminants and eps then release the contaminants back to liquid phase has not been thoroughly elucidated note that more future studies should focus on the unresolved issues mentioned above in order to develop efficient iron based aops for simultaneous enhancement of sludge dewaterability and contaminants removal heavy metals e g as cd cr cu pb and zn and metal resistant genes involved in the sludge would also pose a potential threat to surrounding environments bondarczuk et al 2016 liang et al 2020b the changes of the metals and metal resistant genes during the iron based aops treatment are unclear noticeably sludge is believed to be a reservoir of pathogens e g fecal coliform e coli and klebsiella pneumoniae and viruses e g sars cov 2 and hku1 yang et al 2022 posing an infection risk during sludge collection transportation treatment and disposal processes yu et al 2019b and li et al 2020b evaluated the feasibility of using fe0 based aops to fecal coliform inactivation during the sludge dewatering process and found that ho could effectively destroy the cell wall and then inactivate the pathogens however the fate and transformation of other pathogens and viruses during iron based aops dewatering process still require further investigation also it is of importance to elucidate the synergistic mechanisms of pathogens viruses inactivation and sludge dewatering enhancement during iron based aops process which helps to cut down the risk of pathogens and viruses spreading into the environment compared to the commonly used chemical conditioning methods e g polyacrylamide fecl3 cao the iron based aops treatment has some competitive advantages in the sludge dewatering namely higher sludge dewatering efficiency 95 lower moisture content of sludge cake 60 wt lower operational costs yu et al 2016 liang et al 2020d cao et al 2021 more importantly the iron based aops treatment could potentially alleviate the environmental risks of micropollutants emerging pollutants heavy metals and pathogens in sludge li et al 2020b liang et al 2020d and 2021 zhang et al 2022 which is highly conducive to downstream sludge treatment and disposal e g incineration land application and composting despite the lab scale or pilot scale iron based aops have been successfully applied for sludge dewatering liang et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 yu et al 2016 and 2019a the main challenges of its full scale application are the potential exposure risks of harmful chemicals to operative employees and the safety concerns some of the chemicals used in the iron based aops treatment are unstable corrosive and hazardous heat and toxic gasses are released in this process this would induce the occupational health concerns also given the sensitive reaction conditions of iron based aops the strict and complex procedures of such treatment would require skilled employee in addition to the above mentioned concerns more efforts are required to evaluate the engineering applicability for example the long term field test is not available the optimization of operating factors operating costs and human resource management should be performed at larger scale in particular the utilization of costly chemicals e g pds pms paa h2o2 fe2 fe0 etc should be investigated further sustainable and reagent free technologies such as in situ generation of oxidants and iron via electrocatalysis wang et al 2021b are urgent to be developed towards higher economic benefits and sustainability besides filter cloth fouling is another challenge during the sludge dewatering process as the filter cloth is a costly consumable wakeman 2007 therefore the effects of different iron based aops on the filter cloth durability would be interesting to study it should be noted that the automatic integrated sludge conditioning and dewatering facilities e g automatic dosing and pressing systems should be developed in the future in order to reduce the labor costs and further promote the treatment efficiency last but not the least when implementing iron based aops for sludge deep dewatering the methods to deal with downstream iron rich sludge disposal and the color of the dewatering liquor caused by the fe accumulation are to be developed more importantly the cumulative eco toxicity of iron rich sludge and iron rich dewatering liquor should be fully understood 6 resource recovery and future perspectives after solid liquid separation the iron contained sludge and dewatering liquor are the two residual products in the iron based aops treatment processes with an increasing global demand for renewable energy and sustainable development these two residuals could potentially become the recyclable resources raheem et al 2018 due to the abundant valuable nutrients such as biodegradable organic matters nitrogen n phosphorus p etc kominko et al 2019 in this section the feasibility of reusing dewatering liquor and iron contained sludge is discussed generally as approximately 20 30 of n and p from wastewater are found in sludge dewatering liquor gourdet et al 2017 simoes et al 2020 with the iron based aops treatment the sludge flocs could be largely disintegrated resulting in more than 100 enhancement of the n and p contents in the sludge dewatering liquor gong et al 2015 which can be recovered as nutrient source nutrient recovery from dewatering liquor not only reduces the loads on wastewater treatment works but also to some extend solve the problem of resource shortage raheem et al 2018 crystallization is a commonly applied method to recover n and p from dewatering liquor via the formation of struvite magnesium ammonium phosphate mgnh4po4 6h2o ping et al 2016 or hydroxyapatite hap ca5 po4 3oh rittmann et al 2011 currently p recovery via the generation of vivianite crystals could be an attractive technology as the vivianite can either be a potential fertilizer or used in the electronics industry wilfert et al 2018 tian et al 2019 for example cao et al 2019 mentioned that p in iron contained fermentation dewatering liquor could be effectively recovered as vivianite with applicable ph control 6 0 9 0 wu et al 2020c also reported that 83 1 of the p in the iron contained ad supernatant was successfully recovered as high purity vivianite 93 9 apart from n and p the abundant carbon source also remained in the dewatering liquor simoes et al 2020 owing to the higher carbon content of ad dewatering liquor soluble chemical oxygen demand scod 800 mg l ad dewatering liquor could be considered as a sustainable and cost effective carbon source for biological treatment processes e g anaerobic anoxic oxic process and ad process gourdet et al 2017 cao et al 2019 aerobic granules peyong et al 2012 partial nitritation anammox pn a process han et al 2020 and algae growth chen et al 2016b which has been becoming a promising direction for ad dewatering liquor utilization noticeably the color of the ad dewatering liquor caused by the presence of iron remains as a challenging issue tian and yu 2020 it is necessary to investigate the fates of iron species including their transformations and interactions with organic or inorganic matters in the operation process additionally the colored ad dewatering liquor may not have significant influence on the environment when the iron contained dewatering liquor is returned to the ad system to simultaneously enhance methane production and hydrogen sulfide h2s control luo et al 2018 salehin et al 2020 furthermore the colored ad dewatering liquor offers iron and nutrient source to the novel feammox process for continuous nitrogen removal in wastewater treatment yang et al 2021b noteworthily due to the lower carbon content scod 400 mg l was dewatering liquor could be returned to the inlet of wwtps as the carbon replenishment the residual solids e g sludge cake contains organic matters microbes bacterial constituents e g proteins polysaccharides lipids etc valuable inorganic ingredients e g n p k ca etc and iron kelessidis and stasinakis 2012 tyagi and lo 2013 raheem et al 2018 generally there are four options for the biosolids recovery and reuse including construction materials iron rich biochar environment friendly functional materials land applications and biorefinery products tyagi and lo 2013 gherghel et al 2019 qian et al 2019 wu et al 2020a however the presence of iron in sludge cake could affect the feasibility of biosolids recovery and reuse the conversion of sludge into construction materials has become a mature route for sludge utilization tyagi and lo 2013 the sludge cake containing the inorganic complexes e g silicon dioxide could replace fractional petroleum coke and limestone to produce cement and bricks during co incineration smol et al 2015 abuşoğlu et al 2017 the presence of iron in the sludge would potentially influence the structure of cement and bricks for example kappel et al 2017 mentioned that the iron contained sludge could substitute 20 cement and also enhanced the compressive strength and workability of mortar kizinievič et al 2013 reported that using the iron contained sludge as the additive 10 the compressive flexural strength of bricks was remarkably higher than the reference clay bricks the aforementioned results indicate using iron contained sludge as the additive could potentially promote stability of cement and bricks however this research is in its infancy further research is deserved to investigate the influence of environmental factors e g temperature humidity and etc on the stability of construction materials derived from iron contained sludge in the long term field tests second in australia us and some european countries land application is one of the preferable options for sludge reuse owing to their rich nutrients collivignarelli et al 2019 prior to the land application sludge cake needs to be stabilized aerobic composting in order to realize toxicity reduction e g heavy metals and contaminants and pathogen destruction gherghel et al 2019 to date few studies investigated the iron contained sludge on land application soon et al 1978 mentioned that iron contained sludge could promote the growth of bromegrass due to the roles of iron in promoting enzyme activity liang et al 2020d reported that the iron based aops could mitigate the environmental risk of heavy metals and the phytotoxicity of sludge cake thus promoting its land application in this light the iron contained sludge could be potentially applied to soil for improvement of soil structure porosity and moisture retention noticeably to prevent food chain contamination from heavy metals the iron contained sludge is more suitable for forestry and grasslands application as well as the contaminated soil site remediation therefore further studies can investigate its long term performance third owing to the affluent contents of carbon and iron in the sludge cake a promising sustainable and feasible alternative of sludge reuse is to produce iron rich biochar or environment friendly functional materials via pyrolysis process wu et al 2020a for example wang et al 2021a used iron rich biochar produced from fenton sludge to boost the methane production in the ad system through direct interspecies electron transfer diet tao et al 2019 applied carbon based functional material derived from iron contained sludge to facilitate the bound water released and the sludge dewaterability accordingly such approaches can fulfill zero disposal of sludge cake which is conducive to the development of green circular economy in the future life cycle assessment lca and life cycle cost lcc should be carried out at large scale in order to accelerate the development of the fe sludge reutilization additionally when implementing the sludge cake pyrolysis technology in further application several issues need to be considered 1 different iron based aops may lead to the variation of the characteristics of sludge cake and further alter the properties of iron rich biochar functional materials 2 the pyrolysis operational factors e g temperature temperature increase rate and heating time may affect the quality of iron biochar 3 the transformations of micropollutants emerging pollutants and heavy metals in sludge cake during the pyrolysis process is still not clear 4 the potential emissions of hazardous gas during iron biochar pyrolysis process should be investigated forth aside from nutrients of n and p some biorefinery products including enzymes bio plastics bio pesticides eps flame retardant and proteins can also be recovered from sludge via advanced techniques tyagi and lo 2013 raheem et al 2018 kim et al 2019 these biorefinery products are regarded as feedstock in industrial workshops such as pharmaceutical food cosmetics detergent and fine chemicals tyagi and lo 2013 collivignarelli et al 2019 with regard to iron contained sludge the strong affinity between iron and eps proteins enzymes may reduce biorefinery products recovery efficiencies li et al 2012 further studies should focus on the feasibility to recover biorefinery products from iron contained sludge based on the discussion above a sustainable technology roadmap towards high efficient resource recovery in wwtps is proposed fig 6 the scenarios considered for critical interlinkages in wwtps based on water waste energy nexus mainly including biological treatment ad process sludge conditioning and dewatering processes and sludge reuse system by introducing the scrap iron into the ad system the biogas energy can be efficiently recovered to offset the energy consumption in wwtps waste energy then directly dosing oxidants into the iron rich digestate can achieve high sludge dewaterability after the dewatering process c n and p in iron contained dewatering liquor can be recovered and the residuals can be returned to biological treatment processes as a carbon source water energy meanwhile the iron contained sludge can be converted to iron rich environment materials which can be potentially utilized in the advanced wastewater treatment or ad system waste water during these processes emissions to air water and soil can be significantly cut down we believe that this scheme provides an efficient strategy and competitive scenario to challenge conventional sludge treatment and management strategy taking a further step towards realizing the transition of wwtps to resource recovery plants as well as achieving prospect of water waste energy nexus and sustainable development in the future 7 conclusion and remarks this review summarizes the development of iron based aops in sludge dewatering over the past 20 years offers a holistic analysis on their deficiencies and proposes future research prospects in this area the following conclusions could be put forward based on this review eps content bound water surface charge particle size and rheological properties of sludge are the key factors controlling the barriers of sludge dewaterability the types of mechanical dewatering devices would directly affect the sludge dewatering efficiency homogeneous and heterogeneous iron based aop systems could be applied in both water and sludge treatment via generation of highly reactive radicals the reaction conditions of the iron based aops and the environmental factors would largely affect the sludge dewatering performance among the iron based aops treatment iron based so 4 aops and electro iron based aops could become the effective and promising choices for sludge dewatering owing to their wider applicability higher process efficiency and more economic viability iron based aops cause the variations in the physicochemical characteristics of sludge meantime oxidation and flocculation processes are the underlying mechanisms of sludge dewatering enhancement the major challenges of the real application of the iron based aop for sludge dewatering included the sensitive reaction conditions the occupational health and safety concerns possible production of harmful secondary compounds parameter optimization operation consumables and labor costs the potential reutilization of iron contained sludge and dewatering liquor is systematically summarized for liquid phase valuable nutrients such as c n and p could be recovered there are mainly four options proposed for sludge cake utilization including construction materials iron rich biochar environment friendly functional materials land applications and biorefinery products although significant progress of iron based aops for sludge dewatering have been made currently it should be noted that several unsettled issues still remain we propose the following research directions to be considered in the future it would be good to have more in depth understanding of hydrophilic eps compositions water occurrence states and surface charge characteristics during the sludge dewatering process to achieve sludge deep dewatering with economic feasibility it is imperative to accelerate the research and development of the efficient mechanical dewatering devices a promising iron based aops approach towards wider applicability and higher operation effectiveness is thus urgently needed to achieve high sludge dewatering the role of non radicals e g 1o2 and direct electron transfer as well as reaction kinetics of iron based aops are not clear at this stage more direct evidence of dewatering enhancement is required in order to optimize dosage of chemicals and sludge dewatering efficiency the field scale testing and application are still lacking the large scale study can be coupled with deep machine learning technology to provide real time intelligent decision making and continuous optimal control the transformation of typical micropollutants and some emerging pollutants during the treatment should be traced and analyzed the ecotoxicity of their by products would merit to be evaluated more attention could be paid to using more economical feasible and eco friendly approaches for resource recovery from fe containing liquid and solid sludge in summary a more sustainable approach towards high efficient resource recovery in wwtps is required in order to realize the common goals of water waste energy nexus

15952,the stress response of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and the spread of antibiotic resistance genes args pose a serious threat to the aquatic environment and human beings this study mainly explored the effect of the heterogeneous photocatalytic oxidation uva tio2 system on the stress response mechanism of arb with different antibiotic resistance action targets including the cell wall proteins dna rna folate and the cell membrane results indicate that the stress response mechanism of tetracycline and sulfamethoxazole resistant e coli dh5α which targets the synthesis of protein and folate could rapidly induce global regulators by the overexpression of relative antibiotic resistance action target genes different stress response systems were mediated via cross protection mechanism causing stronger tolerance to an adverse environment than other arb moreover the photocatalytic inactivation mechanism of bacterial cells and a graded response of cellular stress mechanism caused differences in the intensity of the stress mechanism of antibiotic resistance action targets e coli dh5α resistant to cefotaxime and polymyxin targeting synthesis of the cell wall and cell membrane respectively could confer greater advantages to bacterial survival and higher conjugative transfer frequency than e coli dh5α resistant to nalidixic acid and rifampicin which target the synthesis of dna and rna respectively this new perspective provides detailed information on the practical application of photocatalytic oxidation for inactivating arb and hampering the spreading of args in the aquatic environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords stress response mechanism args arb antibiotic resistance action targets photocatalytic inactivation 1 introduction antibiotics are one of the major means to control the growth of bacteria especially those with clinical significance however the abuse of antibiotics has led to the emergence of many types of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb recent studies show that the rapid increase of arb is closely related to the continuous dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes args in the environment ben et al 2019 parnanen et al 2019 pazda et al 2019 it has been reported that horizontal transfer of args promotes the emergence of multi antibiotic resistant bacteria guo et al 2017 an important reason for this is that most of the commonly used antibiotics inhibit synthesis of their respective antibiotic action targets and then inactivated arb release the corresponding args into the environment the released args can be transferred to a new host leading to the emergence of new arb this problem can only be eliminated or reduced if the antibiotics used can completely destroy the dna in the bacteria including the args peter et al 2017 pornsukarom and thakur 2017 unfortunately most antibiotics currently in use do not have a strong dna damaging ability to stop the spread of args there are two major reasons for the increased spread of args first after sub lethal disinfection some arb can survive and their args can be further transferred between microorganisms second even after inactivation of all arb released args can be further transfected to other bacteria via horizontal gene transfer hgt cai et al 2021 li et al 2020 yin et al 2021b for the second route there are two important factors that affect the spreading frequency of the remaining intact args 1 the ability and resident time of disinfection to completely destroy dna molecules and 2 the effect of disinfection treatment on the hgt frequency of bacterial args aminov 2011 lerminiaux and cameron 2019 von wintersdorff et al 2016 yin et al 2020 in response to the increasing spread of arb args it is important to conduct proper disinfection of environmental samples to stop or minimize the spread of arb and args many studies have reported the use of effective water disinfection methods such as uv chen et al 2019 templeton et al 2009 chlorination jia et al 2015 shi et al 2013 yuan et al 2015 and ozonization czekalski et al 2016 to eliminate args and arb however there is evidence that these disinfection methods do not completely purify the args and arb but rather promote the spread of args in aquatic environments to some extent rizzo et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 in recent years uva tio2 heterogenous photocatalysis has drawn tremendous attention in the area of water treatment karaolia et al 2018 xie et al 2021 the fundamental mechanisms of uva tio2 heterogeneous photocatalysis for inactivating arb and args are based on the reactions produced by extracellular reactive oxygen species ros ganguly et al 2018 under uva light irradiation the photocatalysts produce holes and electrons which subsequently initiate oxidation and reduction reactions holes and electrons can transform into hydroxyl radicals cheng and xu 2019 the inactivation efficiency of uva tio2 heterogenous photocatalysis is much more efficient than uv and does not produce disinfection by products relative to chlorinated disinfection and ozone disinfection thus it has been widely studied and used ahmed et al 2020 hwangbo et al 2019 li et al 2015 sun et al 2014 if the arb can withstand photocatalytic oxidation then other weak disinfection methods will undeniably produce similar stress response mechanisms yin et al 2021a some studies have shown that arb can cause a stronger stress response than antibiotic susceptible bacteria asb during the heterogeneous photocatalytic oxidation process which accelerates the spread of args and provides survival advantages chen et al 2019 huang et al 2017 yin et al 2021a however the reasons and underlying mechanisms for differences in the stress response of arb with different antibiotic resistance action targets under exposure to photocatalytic oxidation remains unclear furthermore whether this mechanism affects the hgt frequency of args is unknown in order to systematically study the effect of photocatalysis on the destruction of arb with different antibiotic resistance action targets i e the cell wall cell membrane integrity protein synthesis folate dna and rna as well as its arg damaging ability a typical heterogeneous photocatalytic oxidation uva tio2 system was employed the selected antibiotics covered the complete action target spectrum of commonly used antibiotics and are very frequently found along their corresponding args in environmental waters bengtsson palme and larsson 2015 cutugno et al 2020 milic et al 2013 zhu et al 2020 in addition antibiotic resistance cell morphology conjugational transfer intracellular ros antioxidant enzymes and cellular proteins were analyzed to explore the effect of photocatalytic oxidation on the stress response of different arb from the perspective of args and antibiotic resistance action targets the gene expression of args and antibiotic resistance action targets were determined to further dissect the stress response mechanisms of arb with different antibiotic resistance action targets these results provide detailed information and a new perspective on the practical application of photocatalytic oxidation for the inactivating arb and hampering the spread of args in the aquatic environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial culture and determination of the minimal inhibition concentration e coli dh5α used as asb was obtained from the china general microbiological culture collection center the arb were constructed by introducing a plasmid into e coli dh5α containing the respective args against cefotaxime ctx polymyxin pb tetracycline tet sulfamethoxazole smz nalidixic acid nal and rifampicin ra which were named as e coli dh5α ctx e coli dh5α pb e coli dh5α tet e coli dh5α smz e coli dh5α nal and e coli dh5α ra repspectively these plasmids were incl2 transferable plasmids details on the arb are summarized in table s1 the bacterial strains were cultured overnight in luria bertani lb nutrient broth sangon china with addition of their respective antibiotic 128 mg l 1 ctx 64 mg l 1 pb 4 mg l 1 tet 8 mg l 1 smz 256 mg l 1 nal or 256 mg l 1 ra at 37 c with shaking according to the references chen et al 2018 jiang et al 2017 perreten and boerlin 2003 yin et al 2019 the minimal inhibition concentration mic of the arb was evaluated to assay the evolution of antibiotic resistance under photocatalytic bacterial inactivation further details can be found in the supporting information si 2 2 photocatalytic experiments and observation of bacterial morphology by scanning electron microscopy the bacterial samples and 1 5 g l 1 tio2 nanoparticles aladdin china were mixed in 50 ml quartz reaction flasks beijing perfectlight beijing china the mixtures were then placed in a multi channel photochemical reaction system with ten identical 150 mw cm 2 uva lamps beijing perfectlight beijing china for photocatalytic oxidation the bacterial samples were exposed to photocatalytic oxidation with exposure times from 0 to 50 min the pictures of the reactors are provided in fig s1 and detailed information about photocatalytic experiments can be found in the si scanning electron microscopy sem was performed to observe the damage process of arb with different antibiotic resistance action targets under photocatalysis to assess their stress response ability the sample preparation for sem characterization followed an earlier study li et al 2015 and the details can be found in the si 2 3 detection of stress response on antibiotic resistance action targets to evaluate the degree of stress response by arb under exposure to photocatalytic oxidation the intracellular ros and the activities of the respective antioxidant enzymes were determined the level of intracellular ros was assayed using the fluorogenic dye 2 7 dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate dcfh da invitrogen carlsbad usa according to the reference sun et al 2016 the antioxidant enzymatic activities of superoxide dismutase sod and catalase cat were quantified details of these assays are provided in the si the photocatalytic oxidation effects on antibiotic resistance action targets were explored at a molecular level in different arb the effect of stress response was studied by determining the β lactam content cell membrane permeability lactate dehydrogenase cell membrane potential detection and live dead cell stanning and guanosine triphosphate gtp content of arb the detailed experimental procedures can be found in the si 2 4 quantitative analysis and conjugant identification of antibiotic resistance genes in order to calculate the inactivation efficiency of photocatalytic oxidation on different args and explore whether hgt will occur args were detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr after determining the reaction time through preliminary experiments the args were exposed to photocatalytic oxidation at varying exposure times from 0 to 24 h the qpcr assays which used arg specific primers standard curve construction and detection limit determination were performed according to a previously reported method ren et al 2018 according to the standard curve the gene copy numbers were calculated the detailed experimental procedures can be found in the si to evaluate the conjugative transfer of args and explore the connection between the transfer frequency and antibiotic resistance action targets after exposure to the uva tio2 system the best transfer model was selected for the test according to the reference chen et al 2019 briefly six arb which acted as donors were independently re suspended in a reactor solution with tio2 and then subjected to photocatalytic oxidization at different exposure times donor cells were mixed with streptomycin sm resistant recipient cells e coli c600 sm at a 1 1 ratio 2 ml in total after mating donor recipient transconjugants were screened on lb agar plates containing sm 3000 mg l 1 and the respective antibiotic concentration 2 5 determination of stress response mechanism via gene expression assays in order to further measure the effects of photocatalytic oxidation on the stress response mechanisms of different arb the expression of args and antibiotic resistance action target genes were evaluated by qpcr analysis the 16s rrna gene was used as an internal control yin et al 2020 primer sequences are provided in table s1 and the detailed procedures are shown in the si 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of inactivation efficiencies and gene transfer of different arb in order to evaluate the effects of photocatalytic oxidation on different kinds of arb the inactivation efficiency and antibiotic mics of individual arb as compared with the asb were determined for different processes fig 1 correspondingly quantification of args and determination of conjugative transfer were also performed to evaluate the effects of photocatalytic oxidation on the bacterial genes fig 1e and 1f a significant inactivation of bacteria as determined by the reduction of cell density was found for all bacterial strains furthermore the survival time of arb was longer than that of asb and the arb survival times were obviously different from each other under photocatalysis the e coli dh5α tet and e coli dh5α smz cells could survive up to 50 min during the photocatalytic inactivation process although the other arb could survive up to about 40 min of photocatalytic oxidation e coli dh5α ctx and e coli dh5α pb could survive longer time than e coli dh5α nal and e coli dh5α ra fig 1a and 1c at the same time the survival times of e coli dh5α ctx and e coli dh5α pb was found to be similar as were the survival times of e coli dh5α nal and e coli dh5α ra fig 1c in addition the bacterial inactivation efficiency of uva irradiation and the presence of tio2 alone in the system did not obviously affect the survival of the selected arb and asb fig s1 the antibiotic resistance level of the arb cells increased greatly under photocatalytic oxidation fig 1b moreover the antibiotic resistance level of different arb increased up to 16 fold for ctx 64 fold for pb 32 fold for tet 16 fold for smz 32 fold for nal and 16 fold for rd within 40 min of photocatalytic oxidation fig 1d moreover six selected args were obviously reduced through the process of heterogeneous photocatalytic oxidation and some args mcr 1 and sul3 could be eliminated within 24 h fig 1e however no significant change was observed in the concentrations of the tested args during the arb inactivation process among the three bacterial hgt pathways conjugation of args is the most frequent and efficient in the environment cai et al 2021 massoudieh et al 2007 in this study the number of transconjugants notably increased for all arb except e coli dh5α nal and e coli dh5α ra during the initial stage of exposure i e 10 min the frequency of conjugative transfer from e coli dh5α tet to e coli c600 sm continuously increased and peaked at 20 min however the number of transconjugants for the other arb dramatically decreased and was below the initial level at 20 min conjugational transfer after 30 min of photocatalytic oxidation could be detected for e coli dh5α tet e coli dh5α pb and e coli dh5α smz only transconjugants of e coli dh5α tet and e coli dh5α smz were observed at 40 min fig 1f the above results indicate that all six arb had stronger tolerance than asb to the heterogeneous photocatalytic oxidation process fig 1 oxidation of arb through photocatalysis may induce bacterial stress responses which can confer more advantages for bacterial cell survival and enhance the conjugative transfer beaber et al 2004 makwana et al 2015 yin et al 2020 it is worth nothing that the bacterial characteristics of photocatalytic oxidation for the six arb were obviously different antibiotics targeting synthesis of the cell wall and cell membrane could confer more advantages to bacterial cell survival fig 1a and 1c and higher conjugative transfer frequency fig 1f than those targeting synthesis of dna and rna giannakis et al and kubacka et al also reported similar results giannakis et al 2018 kubacka et al 2014 this may be relative to the mechanism involving inactivation of bacterial cells using photocatalytic oxidation the cell wall and cell membrane were first attacked by ros generated during photocatalytic oxidation while the released proteins were also decomposed at the same time sun et al 2014 we thus hypothesized the reason for these differences may be related to the antibiotic resistance action targets and the sequence of photocatalytic oxidation the antibiotics with similar targets such as the cell wall and cell membrane almost simultaneously functioned when the arb were exposed to photocatalytic oxidation while the differences between e coli dh5α pb and e coli dh5α ctx might be related to the antibiotic resistance action target peptidoglycan saikachi et al 2021 response protection of relevant antibiotic resistance action targets triggered by the process of photocatalytic oxidation might exist leading to differences in the survival of arb and the frequency of hgt 3 2 response of bacterial antibiotic resistance action targets to explore the response of bacterial antibiotic resistance action targets under photocatalytic oxidation sem fig 2 live dead bacteria staining fig 3 e lactic dehydrogenase ldh and cell membrane potential fig 3c and 3d experiments were carried out results of sem analysis indicate that e coli dh5α nal and e coli dh5α ctx maintained normal cell morphology better than asb during photocatalytic oxidation most of the e coli dh5α nal showed shrinkage and lysed after 25 min of photocatalytic oxidation although e coli dh5α ctx cells also showed local shrinkage the cell morphology remained basically unchanged however differences in the response of bacterial antibiotic resistance action targets from arb could be found during photocatalytic oxidation similar results for the cell membrane were also detected through ldh live dead bacteria staining and cell membrane potential experiments during photocatalytic oxidation the fluorescence intensity of e coli dh5α decreased indicating that cell membrane permeability decreased then with the death of a large number of bacterial cells cell membrane rupture and protein extravasation caused the release of proteins gradually increasing their concentration in the cell suspension the proteins partially combined with the dye to reduce the concentration resulting in an increase in the fluorescence concentration until the fluorescence stabilized within 40 min of photocatalytic oxidation indicating that e coli dh5α cells were destroyed under photocatalytic oxidation the bacterial cell membrane potential of e coli dh5α nal and e coli dh5α pb tended to be more stable than that of e coli dh5α the reason that the fluorescence intensity of e coli dh5α nal increased faster than that of e coli dh5α pb after 30 min of photocatalytic oxidation was mainly due to the decomposition of bacterial cells causing the dye to combine with a large number of exosmotic proteins such as ldh these data could indicate that the stress response provides a survival advantage for arb photocatalytic oxidation led to dramatic destruction of the asb as demonstrated by deeper sinking and shriveled cell walls observed in contrast the damage to e coli dh5α ctx was not so obvious figs 2 and 3e as reported arb induce stress responses when encountering oxidation pressure mediated by ros an et al 2016 sun et al 2017 and most arb cells can temporarily maintain viability and avoid destruction by a limited amount of ros generated in the photocatalysis system geeraerd et al 2000 geeraerd et al 2005 although all the arb induced the stress response differences in the degree of response were observed the reason for the differences in response is related to the inactivation sequence of photocatalytic oxidation on the bacterial cells qiu et al 2020 the response of e coli dh5α ctx was first activated to maintain cell morphology when the cell wall was attacked by ros generated due to photocatalytic oxidation which was different than the response of e coli dh5α nal fig 2 comparatively damage related to cell membrane integrity loss and increased permeability caused by photocatalytic oxidation was more obvious in e coli dh5α nal than e coli dh5α pb fig 3c and 3d e coli dh5α pb might initiate a strong response of antibiotic resistance action targets resulting in a stronger affinity to the mcr 1 protein and lipid a during photocatalysis with the lipopolysaccharides and proteins contributing to the stiffness of the outer membrane li et al 2017 which provides an advantage for survival under adverse environmental conditions rojas et al 2018 3 3 stress response of arb stress response plays a crucial role in the antimicrobial resistance of gram negative bacteria poole 2012 exposure to photo generated ros causes bacteria to respond to stress by producing cat and sod antioxidant enzymes that detoxify superoxide o2 and h2o2 cabiscol et al 2000 fraud and poole 2011 vega et al 2013 exposure to photocatalytic oxidation first caused an increase followed by a decrease in the relative levels of ros in the bacterial cultures of the six investigated arb strains fig 4 a compared to the asb a higher level of intracellular ros could be detected in all the selected arb cells which remained high during photocatalytic oxidation at the same time both the sod and cat activities first increased and then decreased during photocatalytic oxidation fig 4b and 4c similar results were found in earlier work chen et al 2019 sun et al 2017 however the levels of cat and sod as well as the level of the intracellular ros were lower in e coli dh5α pb and e coli dh5α ctx than those of other the arb it is worth noting that the resistance action targets of e coli dh5α pb and e coli dh5α ctx are the cell envelope and cell wall respectively when ros cause a stress response in the bacterial cells due to antibiotics targeting the cell wall and cell membrane the arb initiate a protective response this protective response accelerates cell repair and maintains the fitness of the membrane jiang et al 2011 compared the other arb this resulted in a low level of intracellular ros being detected in e coli dh5α pb and e coli dh5α ctx cells and a further reduction in cat and sod used to resist intracellular ros β lactamases resist the combination between β lactam and penicillin binding proteins preventing damage to the cell wall and maintaining cell morphology kim et al 2014 their production was also found indicating that e coli dh5α ctx had a strong protective response of the antibiotic resistance action target under photocatalytic oxidation fig 3a compared with e coli dh5α pb and e coli dh5α ctx the stress response degrees of e coli dh5α nal and e coli dh5α ra were limited under photocatalytic oxidation the cellular stress response is graded and the properties vary with the extent of cell damage somero 2020 somero found that the response targeting dna and rna might happen at a later stage of the stress in addition time is required for cell repair when dna is subjected to a high level of endogenous damage caused by a lack of dna damage response in arb ciccia and elledge 2010 curtin 2012 thus the degree of photocatalytic oxidation on the antibiotic resistance action targets of e coli dh5α nal and e coli dh5α ra was limited and the protective response was not obvious for e coli dh5α tet the intracellular ros was maintained at a high level during the reaction process resulting in a strong stress response and consequently production of a large amount of sod and cat fig 4 these results were similar to the work by lushchak who found that the expression products of certain genes were helpful under continuous exposure to enhanced ros levels lushchak 2011 the gtp results also indicate that photocatalytic oxidation caused a strong stress response in e coli dh5α tet which required more energy to synthesize relative antioxidant enzymes to combat the adverse environment fig 3b at the same time the presence of gtp also had a synergistic effect with tetm protein in the cells which improves the antibiotic tolerance of e coli dh5α tet arenz et al 2015 burdett 1996 changes in the stress response of e coli dh5α smz during photocatalysis also showed the same trend as that of e coli dh5α tet fig 4 this indicates that the protective response of antibiotic targeting folate synthesis could confer more advantages by modulating energy metabolism to provide atp and restoring the integrity of macromolecular systems kok et al 2020 this is consistent with the bacterial inactivation results where the bacteria cells showed less lethal injuries and kept their activity for a long time as reported e coli dh5α smz was in the stress response state during most of the treatment reducing the damage caused by the generated ros sun et al 2017 based on the above results the stress response of antibiotic resistance action targets on e coli dh5α ctx and e coli dh5α pb cells was first triggered by extracellular ros to combat oxidative damage subsequently the cellular ros increased dramatically causing a strong stress response of e coli dh5α tet and e coli dh5α smz as well as inducing a global response to combat the damage however the low degree response of photocatalytic oxidation on the antibiotic resistance action targets of e coli dh5α nal and e coli dh5α ra was relative to its hysteretic graded stress response and the unobvious protective response of antibiotic resistance action targets 3 4 gene regulation mechanism of arb to clarify the underlying mechanisms of the bacterial cells with different antibiotic resistance action targets to stress from photocatalytic oxidation the expression of genes associated with antibiotic resistance action targets were compared the expression of all the studied genes is illustrated in a heat map fig 5 for the asb the level of gene expression associated with antibiotics targeting the cell wall cell membrane protein synthesis folate synthesis dna synthesis and rna synthesis was low under exposure to photocatalytic oxidation in contrast when the arb were subjected to photocatalytic oxidation the expression of genes related to antibiotic resistance action targets increased about 2 8 fold which was notably higher than that of asb furthermore the expression of genes for antibiotic resistance action targets varied among individual arb and the relative target gene expression in the specific arb was obvious which could be attributed to the different antibiotic resistance action target mechanisms of the stress response compared with e coli dh5α nal and e coli dh5α ra the gene expression of e coli dh5α ctx and e coli dh5α pb in which the cell wall and cell membrane were respectively targeted were obviously up regulated with an initial 30 min of photocatalytic oxidation especially their respective relative target genes these results indicate that the stress response of antibiotic resistance action targets depends on the bacterial inactivation mechanism and the graded bacterial stress response during photocatalytic oxidation causing the stress response mechanism of bacterial cells with targeted dna and rna to be unobvious and mainly occurring later in the stress period kültz 2020 sun et al 2017 most of the tested genes were up regulated in e coli dh5α tet cells under photocatalytic oxidation this indicates that the damage to e coli dh5α tet can quickly induce global regulators mediating different stress response systems via the cross protection mechanism mitchell et al 2009 young et al 2013 as for e coli dh5α smz enhanced tolerance was related to the overexpression of sul3 and related genes targeting folate synthesis folate is necessary for carbon transfer reactions during the biosynthesis of a spectrum of biomolecules including amino acids and nucleotides capasso and supuran 2014 the enhanced expression of folate synthesis related genes indicates that e coli dh5α smz triggered a strong stress response mechanism for antibiotic resistance action targets under photocatalytic oxidation based on the above results the extracellular ros generated by photocatalytic oxidation first caused the stress response mechanism of e coli dh5α ctx and e coli dh5α pb in which the cell wall and cell membrane were targeted to repair the damaged cell wall and maintain membrane permeability correspondingly the stress mechanism of e coli dh5α tet in which protein synthesis was targeted was also triggered and enhanced by the increased cellular ros level especially after the activated sos response mechanism which produced a large number of antioxidant enzymes to ensure survival of the bacterial cells in addition the overexpression of folate caused by the stress response mechanism of e coli dh5α smz played a key role in maintaining normal metabolism of the bacterial cells and ensuring stability of hereditary substances as for e coli dh5α nal and e coli dh5α ra due to the graded cellular response of arb the stress response mechanism of bacterial cells with targeted dna and rna was unobvious and caused weak tolerance under photocatalytic oxidation overall these results show in detail the effects of photocatalytic oxidation on the stress response mechanism of bacterial cells with different antibiotic resistance action targets fig 6 moreover strong evidence was provided for a response mechanism that can enhance antibiotic tolerance and accelerate the repair of bacterial cells under photocatalytic oxidation conferring more advantages to combat adverse environments 4 conclusions this study mainly demonstrates that arb with different antibiotic resistance action targets will respond differently to stress caused by photocatalytic oxidation resulting in varying bacterial inactivation efficiencies antibiotic resistance cell morphology and conjugational transfer characteristics antioxidant enzyme activities and cellular protein contents the stress response mechanism of e coli dh5α tet and e coli dh5α smz in which synthesis of protein and folate is targeted could rapidly induce global regulators through the overexpression of the respective antibiotic resistance action target genes this mediates different stress response systems via the cross protection mechanism which enhances the antibiotic tolerance of bacteria in adverse environments moreover the photocatalytic bacterial inactivation mechanism of different bacterial cells and the graded response of the cellular stress mechanism leads to differences in the intensity of the stress mechanism related to antibiotic resistance action targets resulting in a stronger tolerance of e coli dh5α pb and e coli dh5α ctx than that of e coli dh5α nal and e coli dh5α ra this new perspective reveals more detailed information on the practical

15952,the stress response of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and the spread of antibiotic resistance genes args pose a serious threat to the aquatic environment and human beings this study mainly explored the effect of the heterogeneous photocatalytic oxidation uva tio2 system on the stress response mechanism of arb with different antibiotic resistance action targets including the cell wall proteins dna rna folate and the cell membrane results indicate that the stress response mechanism of tetracycline and sulfamethoxazole resistant e coli dh5α which targets the synthesis of protein and folate could rapidly induce global regulators by the overexpression of relative antibiotic resistance action target genes different stress response systems were mediated via cross protection mechanism causing stronger tolerance to an adverse environment than other arb moreover the photocatalytic inactivation mechanism of bacterial cells and a graded response of cellular stress mechanism caused differences in the intensity of the stress mechanism of antibiotic resistance action targets e coli dh5α resistant to cefotaxime and polymyxin targeting synthesis of the cell wall and cell membrane respectively could confer greater advantages to bacterial survival and higher conjugative transfer frequency than e coli dh5α resistant to nalidixic acid and rifampicin which target the synthesis of dna and rna respectively this new perspective provides detailed information on the practical application of photocatalytic oxidation for inactivating arb and hampering the spreading of args in the aquatic environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords stress response mechanism args arb antibiotic resistance action targets photocatalytic inactivation 1 introduction antibiotics are one of the major means to control the growth of bacteria especially those with clinical significance however the abuse of antibiotics has led to the emergence of many types of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb recent studies show that the rapid increase of arb is closely related to the continuous dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes args in the environment ben et al 2019 parnanen et al 2019 pazda et al 2019 it has been reported that horizontal transfer of args promotes the emergence of multi antibiotic resistant bacteria guo et al 2017 an important reason for this is that most of the commonly used antibiotics inhibit synthesis of their respective antibiotic action targets and then inactivated arb release the corresponding args into the environment the released args can be transferred to a new host leading to the emergence of new arb this problem can only be eliminated or reduced if the antibiotics used can completely destroy the dna in the bacteria including the args peter et al 2017 pornsukarom and thakur 2017 unfortunately most antibiotics currently in use do not have a strong dna damaging ability to stop the spread of args there are two major reasons for the increased spread of args first after sub lethal disinfection some arb can survive and their args can be further transferred between microorganisms second even after inactivation of all arb released args can be further transfected to other bacteria via horizontal gene transfer hgt cai et al 2021 li et al 2020 yin et al 2021b for the second route there are two important factors that affect the spreading frequency of the remaining intact args 1 the ability and resident time of disinfection to completely destroy dna molecules and 2 the effect of disinfection treatment on the hgt frequency of bacterial args aminov 2011 lerminiaux and cameron 2019 von wintersdorff et al 2016 yin et al 2020 in response to the increasing spread of arb args it is important to conduct proper disinfection of environmental samples to stop or minimize the spread of arb and args many studies have reported the use of effective water disinfection methods such as uv chen et al 2019 templeton et al 2009 chlorination jia et al 2015 shi et al 2013 yuan et al 2015 and ozonization czekalski et al 2016 to eliminate args and arb however there is evidence that these disinfection methods do not completely purify the args and arb but rather promote the spread of args in aquatic environments to some extent rizzo et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 in recent years uva tio2 heterogenous photocatalysis has drawn tremendous attention in the area of water treatment karaolia et al 2018 xie et al 2021 the fundamental mechanisms of uva tio2 heterogeneous photocatalysis for inactivating arb and args are based on the reactions produced by extracellular reactive oxygen species ros ganguly et al 2018 under uva light irradiation the photocatalysts produce holes and electrons which subsequently initiate oxidation and reduction reactions holes and electrons can transform into hydroxyl radicals cheng and xu 2019 the inactivation efficiency of uva tio2 heterogenous photocatalysis is much more efficient than uv and does not produce disinfection by products relative to chlorinated disinfection and ozone disinfection thus it has been widely studied and used ahmed et al 2020 hwangbo et al 2019 li et al 2015 sun et al 2014 if the arb can withstand photocatalytic oxidation then other weak disinfection methods will undeniably produce similar stress response mechanisms yin et al 2021a some studies have shown that arb can cause a stronger stress response than antibiotic susceptible bacteria asb during the heterogeneous photocatalytic oxidation process which accelerates the spread of args and provides survival advantages chen et al 2019 huang et al 2017 yin et al 2021a however the reasons and underlying mechanisms for differences in the stress response of arb with different antibiotic resistance action targets under exposure to photocatalytic oxidation remains unclear furthermore whether this mechanism affects the hgt frequency of args is unknown in order to systematically study the effect of photocatalysis on the destruction of arb with different antibiotic resistance action targets i e the cell wall cell membrane integrity protein synthesis folate dna and rna as well as its arg damaging ability a typical heterogeneous photocatalytic oxidation uva tio2 system was employed the selected antibiotics covered the complete action target spectrum of commonly used antibiotics and are very frequently found along their corresponding args in environmental waters bengtsson palme and larsson 2015 cutugno et al 2020 milic et al 2013 zhu et al 2020 in addition antibiotic resistance cell morphology conjugational transfer intracellular ros antioxidant enzymes and cellular proteins were analyzed to explore the effect of photocatalytic oxidation on the stress response of different arb from the perspective of args and antibiotic resistance action targets the gene expression of args and antibiotic resistance action targets were determined to further dissect the stress response mechanisms of arb with different antibiotic resistance action targets these results provide detailed information and a new perspective on the practical application of photocatalytic oxidation for the inactivating arb and hampering the spread of args in the aquatic environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial culture and determination of the minimal inhibition concentration e coli dh5α used as asb was obtained from the china general microbiological culture collection center the arb were constructed by introducing a plasmid into e coli dh5α containing the respective args against cefotaxime ctx polymyxin pb tetracycline tet sulfamethoxazole smz nalidixic acid nal and rifampicin ra which were named as e coli dh5α ctx e coli dh5α pb e coli dh5α tet e coli dh5α smz e coli dh5α nal and e coli dh5α ra repspectively these plasmids were incl2 transferable plasmids details on the arb are summarized in table s1 the bacterial strains were cultured overnight in luria bertani lb nutrient broth sangon china with addition of their respective antibiotic 128 mg l 1 ctx 64 mg l 1 pb 4 mg l 1 tet 8 mg l 1 smz 256 mg l 1 nal or 256 mg l 1 ra at 37 c with shaking according to the references chen et al 2018 jiang et al 2017 perreten and boerlin 2003 yin et al 2019 the minimal inhibition concentration mic of the arb was evaluated to assay the evolution of antibiotic resistance under photocatalytic bacterial inactivation further details can be found in the supporting information si 2 2 photocatalytic experiments and observation of bacterial morphology by scanning electron microscopy the bacterial samples and 1 5 g l 1 tio2 nanoparticles aladdin china were mixed in 50 ml quartz reaction flasks beijing perfectlight beijing china the mixtures were then placed in a multi channel photochemical reaction system with ten identical 150 mw cm 2 uva lamps beijing perfectlight beijing china for photocatalytic oxidation the bacterial samples were exposed to photocatalytic oxidation with exposure times from 0 to 50 min the pictures of the reactors are provided in fig s1 and detailed information about photocatalytic experiments can be found in the si scanning electron microscopy sem was performed to observe the damage process of arb with different antibiotic resistance action targets under photocatalysis to assess their stress response ability the sample preparation for sem characterization followed an earlier study li et al 2015 and the details can be found in the si 2 3 detection of stress response on antibiotic resistance action targets to evaluate the degree of stress response by arb under exposure to photocatalytic oxidation the intracellular ros and the activities of the respective antioxidant enzymes were determined the level of intracellular ros was assayed using the fluorogenic dye 2 7 dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate dcfh da invitrogen carlsbad usa according to the reference sun et al 2016 the antioxidant enzymatic activities of superoxide dismutase sod and catalase cat were quantified details of these assays are provided in the si the photocatalytic oxidation effects on antibiotic resistance action targets were explored at a molecular level in different arb the effect of stress response was studied by determining the β lactam content cell membrane permeability lactate dehydrogenase cell membrane potential detection and live dead cell stanning and guanosine triphosphate gtp content of arb the detailed experimental procedures can be found in the si 2 4 quantitative analysis and conjugant identification of antibiotic resistance genes in order to calculate the inactivation efficiency of photocatalytic oxidation on different args and explore whether hgt will occur args were detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr after determining the reaction time through preliminary experiments the args were exposed to photocatalytic oxidation at varying exposure times from 0 to 24 h the qpcr assays which used arg specific primers standard curve construction and detection limit determination were performed according to a previously reported method ren et al 2018 according to the standard curve the gene copy numbers were calculated the detailed experimental procedures can be found in the si to evaluate the conjugative transfer of args and explore the connection between the transfer frequency and antibiotic resistance action targets after exposure to the uva tio2 system the best transfer model was selected for the test according to the reference chen et al 2019 briefly six arb which acted as donors were independently re suspended in a reactor solution with tio2 and then subjected to photocatalytic oxidization at different exposure times donor cells were mixed with streptomycin sm resistant recipient cells e coli c600 sm at a 1 1 ratio 2 ml in total after mating donor recipient transconjugants were screened on lb agar plates containing sm 3000 mg l 1 and the respective antibiotic concentration 2 5 determination of stress response mechanism via gene expression assays in order to further measure the effects of photocatalytic oxidation on the stress response mechanisms of different arb the expression of args and antibiotic resistance action target genes were evaluated by qpcr analysis the 16s rrna gene was used as an internal control yin et al 2020 primer sequences are provided in table s1 and the detailed procedures are shown in the si 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of inactivation efficiencies and gene transfer of different arb in order to evaluate the effects of photocatalytic oxidation on different kinds of arb the inactivation efficiency and antibiotic mics of individual arb as compared with the asb were determined for different processes fig 1 correspondingly quantification of args and determination of conjugative transfer were also performed to evaluate the effects of photocatalytic oxidation on the bacterial genes fig 1e and 1f a significant inactivation of bacteria as determined by the reduction of cell density was found for all bacterial strains furthermore the survival time of arb was longer than that of asb and the arb survival times were obviously different from each other under photocatalysis the e coli dh5α tet and e coli dh5α smz cells could survive up to 50 min during the photocatalytic inactivation process although the other arb could survive up to about 40 min of photocatalytic oxidation e coli dh5α ctx and e coli dh5α pb could survive longer time than e coli dh5α nal and e coli dh5α ra fig 1a and 1c at the same time the survival times of e coli dh5α ctx and e coli dh5α pb was found to be similar as were the survival times of e coli dh5α nal and e coli dh5α ra fig 1c in addition the bacterial inactivation efficiency of uva irradiation and the presence of tio2 alone in the system did not obviously affect the survival of the selected arb and asb fig s1 the antibiotic resistance level of the arb cells increased greatly under photocatalytic oxidation fig 1b moreover the antibiotic resistance level of different arb increased up to 16 fold for ctx 64 fold for pb 32 fold for tet 16 fold for smz 32 fold for nal and 16 fold for rd within 40 min of photocatalytic oxidation fig 1d moreover six selected args were obviously reduced through the process of heterogeneous photocatalytic oxidation and some args mcr 1 and sul3 could be eliminated within 24 h fig 1e however no significant change was observed in the concentrations of the tested args during the arb inactivation process among the three bacterial hgt pathways conjugation of args is the most frequent and efficient in the environment cai et al 2021 massoudieh et al 2007 in this study the number of transconjugants notably increased for all arb except e coli dh5α nal and e coli dh5α ra during the initial stage of exposure i e 10 min the frequency of conjugative transfer from e coli dh5α tet to e coli c600 sm continuously increased and peaked at 20 min however the number of transconjugants for the other arb dramatically decreased and was below the initial level at 20 min conjugational transfer after 30 min of photocatalytic oxidation could be detected for e coli dh5α tet e coli dh5α pb and e coli dh5α smz only transconjugants of e coli dh5α tet and e coli dh5α smz were observed at 40 min fig 1f the above results indicate that all six arb had stronger tolerance than asb to the heterogeneous photocatalytic oxidation process fig 1 oxidation of arb through photocatalysis may induce bacterial stress responses which can confer more advantages for bacterial cell survival and enhance the conjugative transfer beaber et al 2004 makwana et al 2015 yin et al 2020 it is worth nothing that the bacterial characteristics of photocatalytic oxidation for the six arb were obviously different antibiotics targeting synthesis of the cell wall and cell membrane could confer more advantages to bacterial cell survival fig 1a and 1c and higher conjugative transfer frequency fig 1f than those targeting synthesis of dna and rna giannakis et al and kubacka et al also reported similar results giannakis et al 2018 kubacka et al 2014 this may be relative to the mechanism involving inactivation of bacterial cells using photocatalytic oxidation the cell wall and cell membrane were first attacked by ros generated during photocatalytic oxidation while the released proteins were also decomposed at the same time sun et al 2014 we thus hypothesized the reason for these differences may be related to the antibiotic resistance action targets and the sequence of photocatalytic oxidation the antibiotics with similar targets such as the cell wall and cell membrane almost simultaneously functioned when the arb were exposed to photocatalytic oxidation while the differences between e coli dh5α pb and e coli dh5α ctx might be related to the antibiotic resistance action target peptidoglycan saikachi et al 2021 response protection of relevant antibiotic resistance action targets triggered by the process of photocatalytic oxidation might exist leading to differences in the survival of arb and the frequency of hgt 3 2 response of bacterial antibiotic resistance action targets to explore the response of bacterial antibiotic resistance action targets under photocatalytic oxidation sem fig 2 live dead bacteria staining fig 3 e lactic dehydrogenase ldh and cell membrane potential fig 3c and 3d experiments were carried out results of sem analysis indicate that e coli dh5α nal and e coli dh5α ctx maintained normal cell morphology better than asb during photocatalytic oxidation most of the e coli dh5α nal showed shrinkage and lysed after 25 min of photocatalytic oxidation although e coli dh5α ctx cells also showed local shrinkage the cell morphology remained basically unchanged however differences in the response of bacterial antibiotic resistance action targets from arb could be found during photocatalytic oxidation similar results for the cell membrane were also detected through ldh live dead bacteria staining and cell membrane potential experiments during photocatalytic oxidation the fluorescence intensity of e coli dh5α decreased indicating that cell membrane permeability decreased then with the death of a large number of bacterial cells cell membrane rupture and protein extravasation caused the release of proteins gradually increasing their concentration in the cell suspension the proteins partially combined with the dye to reduce the concentration resulting in an increase in the fluorescence concentration until the fluorescence stabilized within 40 min of photocatalytic oxidation indicating that e coli dh5α cells were destroyed under photocatalytic oxidation the bacterial cell membrane potential of e coli dh5α nal and e coli dh5α pb tended to be more stable than that of e coli dh5α the reason that the fluorescence intensity of e coli dh5α nal increased faster than that of e coli dh5α pb after 30 min of photocatalytic oxidation was mainly due to the decomposition of bacterial cells causing the dye to combine with a large number of exosmotic proteins such as ldh these data could indicate that the stress response provides a survival advantage for arb photocatalytic oxidation led to dramatic destruction of the asb as demonstrated by deeper sinking and shriveled cell walls observed in contrast the damage to e coli dh5α ctx was not so obvious figs 2 and 3e as reported arb induce stress responses when encountering oxidation pressure mediated by ros an et al 2016 sun et al 2017 and most arb cells can temporarily maintain viability and avoid destruction by a limited amount of ros generated in the photocatalysis system geeraerd et al 2000 geeraerd et al 2005 although all the arb induced the stress response differences in the degree of response were observed the reason for the differences in response is related to the inactivation sequence of photocatalytic oxidation on the bacterial cells qiu et al 2020 the response of e coli dh5α ctx was first activated to maintain cell morphology when the cell wall was attacked by ros generated due to photocatalytic oxidation which was different than the response of e coli dh5α nal fig 2 comparatively damage related to cell membrane integrity loss and increased permeability caused by photocatalytic oxidation was more obvious in e coli dh5α nal than e coli dh5α pb fig 3c and 3d e coli dh5α pb might initiate a strong response of antibiotic resistance action targets resulting in a stronger affinity to the mcr 1 protein and lipid a during photocatalysis with the lipopolysaccharides and proteins contributing to the stiffness of the outer membrane li et al 2017 which provides an advantage for survival under adverse environmental conditions rojas et al 2018 3 3 stress response of arb stress response plays a crucial role in the antimicrobial resistance of gram negative bacteria poole 2012 exposure to photo generated ros causes bacteria to respond to stress by producing cat and sod antioxidant enzymes that detoxify superoxide o2 and h2o2 cabiscol et al 2000 fraud and poole 2011 vega et al 2013 exposure to photocatalytic oxidation first caused an increase followed by a decrease in the relative levels of ros in the bacterial cultures of the six investigated arb strains fig 4 a compared to the asb a higher level of intracellular ros could be detected in all the selected arb cells which remained high during photocatalytic oxidation at the same time both the sod and cat activities first increased and then decreased during photocatalytic oxidation fig 4b and 4c similar results were found in earlier work chen et al 2019 sun et al 2017 however the levels of cat and sod as well as the level of the intracellular ros were lower in e coli dh5α pb and e coli dh5α ctx than those of other the arb it is worth noting that the resistance action targets of e coli dh5α pb and e coli dh5α ctx are the cell envelope and cell wall respectively when ros cause a stress response in the bacterial cells due to antibiotics targeting the cell wall and cell membrane the arb initiate a protective response this protective response accelerates cell repair and maintains the fitness of the membrane jiang et al 2011 compared the other arb this resulted in a low level of intracellular ros being detected in e coli dh5α pb and e coli dh5α ctx cells and a further reduction in cat and sod used to resist intracellular ros β lactamases resist the combination between β lactam and penicillin binding proteins preventing damage to the cell wall and maintaining cell morphology kim et al 2014 their production was also found indicating that e coli dh5α ctx had a strong protective response of the antibiotic resistance action target under photocatalytic oxidation fig 3a compared with e coli dh5α pb and e coli dh5α ctx the stress response degrees of e coli dh5α nal and e coli dh5α ra were limited under photocatalytic oxidation the cellular stress response is graded and the properties vary with the extent of cell damage somero 2020 somero found that the response targeting dna and rna might happen at a later stage of the stress in addition time is required for cell repair when dna is subjected to a high level of endogenous damage caused by a lack of dna damage response in arb ciccia and elledge 2010 curtin 2012 thus the degree of photocatalytic oxidation on the antibiotic resistance action targets of e coli dh5α nal and e coli dh5α ra was limited and the protective response was not obvious for e coli dh5α tet the intracellular ros was maintained at a high level during the reaction process resulting in a strong stress response and consequently production of a large amount of sod and cat fig 4 these results were similar to the work by lushchak who found that the expression products of certain genes were helpful under continuous exposure to enhanced ros levels lushchak 2011 the gtp results also indicate that photocatalytic oxidation caused a strong stress response in e coli dh5α tet which required more energy to synthesize relative antioxidant enzymes to combat the adverse environment fig 3b at the same time the presence of gtp also had a synergistic effect with tetm protein in the cells which improves the antibiotic tolerance of e coli dh5α tet arenz et al 2015 burdett 1996 changes in the stress response of e coli dh5α smz during photocatalysis also showed the same trend as that of e coli dh5α tet fig 4 this indicates that the protective response of antibiotic targeting folate synthesis could confer more advantages by modulating energy metabolism to provide atp and restoring the integrity of macromolecular systems kok et al 2020 this is consistent with the bacterial inactivation results where the bacteria cells showed less lethal injuries and kept their activity for a long time as reported e coli dh5α smz was in the stress response state during most of the treatment reducing the damage caused by the generated ros sun et al 2017 based on the above results the stress response of antibiotic resistance action targets on e coli dh5α ctx and e coli dh5α pb cells was first triggered by extracellular ros to combat oxidative damage subsequently the cellular ros increased dramatically causing a strong stress response of e coli dh5α tet and e coli dh5α smz as well as inducing a global response to combat the damage however the low degree response of photocatalytic oxidation on the antibiotic resistance action targets of e coli dh5α nal and e coli dh5α ra was relative to its hysteretic graded stress response and the unobvious protective response of antibiotic resistance action targets 3 4 gene regulation mechanism of arb to clarify the underlying mechanisms of the bacterial cells with different antibiotic resistance action targets to stress from photocatalytic oxidation the expression of genes associated with antibiotic resistance action targets were compared the expression of all the studied genes is illustrated in a heat map fig 5 for the asb the level of gene expression associated with antibiotics targeting the cell wall cell membrane protein synthesis folate synthesis dna synthesis and rna synthesis was low under exposure to photocatalytic oxidation in contrast when the arb were subjected to photocatalytic oxidation the expression of genes related to antibiotic resistance action targets increased about 2 8 fold which was notably higher than that of asb furthermore the expression of genes for antibiotic resistance action targets varied among individual arb and the relative target gene expression in the specific arb was obvious which could be attributed to the different antibiotic resistance action target mechanisms of the stress response compared with e coli dh5α nal and e coli dh5α ra the gene expression of e coli dh5α ctx and e coli dh5α pb in which the cell wall and cell membrane were respectively targeted were obviously up regulated with an initial 30 min of photocatalytic oxidation especially their respective relative target genes these results indicate that the stress response of antibiotic resistance action targets depends on the bacterial inactivation mechanism and the graded bacterial stress

sun et al 2017 most of the tested genes were up regulated in e coli dh5α tet cells under photocatalytic oxidation this indicates that the damage to e coli dh5α tet can quickly induce global regulators mediating different stress response systems via the cross protection mechanism mitchell et al 2009 young et al 2013 as for e coli dh5α smz enhanced tolerance was related to the overexpression of sul3 and related genes targeting folate synthesis folate is necessary for carbon transfer reactions during the biosynthesis of a spectrum of biomolecules including amino acids and nucleotides capasso and supuran 2014 the enhanced expression of folate synthesis related genes indicates that e coli dh5α smz triggered a strong stress response mechanism for antibiotic resistance action targets under photocatalytic oxidation based on the above results the extracellular ros generated by photocatalytic oxidation first caused the stress response mechanism of e coli dh5α ctx and e coli dh5α pb in which the cell wall and cell membrane were targeted to repair the damaged cell wall and maintain membrane permeability correspondingly the stress mechanism of e coli dh5α tet in which protein synthesis was targeted was also triggered and enhanced by the increased cellular ros level especially after the activated sos response mechanism which produced a large number of antioxidant enzymes to ensure survival of the bacterial cells in addition the overexpression of folate caused by the stress response mechanism of e coli dh5α smz played a key role in maintaining normal metabolism of the bacterial cells and ensuring stability of hereditary substances as for e coli dh5α nal and e coli dh5α ra due to the graded cellular response of arb the stress response mechanism of bacterial cells with targeted dna and rna was unobvious and caused weak tolerance under photocatalytic oxidation overall these results show in detail the effects of photocatalytic oxidation on the stress response mechanism of bacterial cells with different antibiotic resistance action targets fig 6 moreover strong evidence was provided for a response mechanism that can enhance antibiotic tolerance and accelerate the repair of bacterial cells under photocatalytic oxidation conferring more advantages to combat adverse environments 4 conclusions this study mainly demonstrates that arb with different antibiotic resistance action targets will respond differently to stress caused by photocatalytic oxidation resulting in varying bacterial inactivation efficiencies antibiotic resistance cell morphology and conjugational transfer characteristics antioxidant enzyme activities and cellular protein contents the stress response mechanism of e coli dh5α tet and e coli dh5α smz in which

15953,seawater seasonal fluctuation results in its close interaction with freshwater in the coastal area which may affect behavior of contaminants there this study was conducted to explore the transport and transformation of soil colloid and associated cr during freshwater and seawater alternating fluctuations by laboratory experiment and numerical simulation such a fluctuation brought downward migration of cr from upper contaminated soil and induced reduction of cr vi into cr iii an obvious increase of retained cr iii was observed at the lower layers of soil due to the reducing environment more importantly the colloids with average sizes between 800 1500 nm was formed during the fluctuation and mainly composed of microcline and fe mn oxides minerals which determined the cr transport compared with the previous freshwater fluctuation seawater fluctuations generated more and larger sized colloids due to its high ionic strength these colloids carried over 94 cr in the effluent and cr iii accounted for over 95 of total cr a colloid facilitated cr transport modeling showed that the soil retained cr decreased by about 14 after eight rounds of fluctuation on an actual

the coastal area manasrah et al 2009 groundwater dynamics in coastal regions include submarine freshwater discharge and movement of the freshwater seawater interface robinson et al 2007 taniguchi et al 2002 therefore the interaction between seawater and freshwater is widespread in the coastal zone and intrusion of seawater into coastal aquifers is a widespread contamination phenomenon that increasingly causes groundwater salinization problems worldwide abarca et al 2007 seawater intrusion makes coastal zones groundwater susceptible to seawater fluctuations charette and sholkovitz 2002 and results in the alternating fluctuation of freshwater and seawater in the shallow aquifers near the coastline in the alternating fluctuation zone freshwater and seawater are characterized by rapid variations in the physicochemical condition due to water level change salinity movement mineral precipitation colloid transport and redox processes besides the aquifer hydrochemical conditions change near these interfaces and the states of colloids in porous medium are activated due to ionic strength and ph fluctuations grolimund and borkovec 2005 the seawater intrusion and refreshing processes

the migration and transformation mechanism of heavy metal pollutants from vadose zone to saturated aquifer in the gtf zone induced by freshwater and seawater alternating fluctuations as one of the priority pollutants that are widely present in the environment ceballos et al 2020 chromium mainly exists in two common oxidation states trivalent chromium cr iii and hexavalent chromium cr vi cr vi exists in the form of anions and is very soluble while cr iii exists in the form of cations and easily precipitates shen 1996 cr vi is widely acknowledged as one of the most toxic chemicals known and has been linked to carcinoma chromosomal mutations aberrations and dna damage gu et al 2017 the hydrodynamic conditions variations in the gtf zone could affect the migration and transformation of cr in electroplating sites in the seashore aramrak et al 2014 hydrodynamic conditions or chemical disturbances may cause the release and deposition of soil colloids and their migration behavior will change with the intensity of disturbances gao et al 2004 li et al 2021 zhuang and jin 2003 in general the colloids are particles with diameters of less than 10 μm john et al 1989 these colloidal particles have a large specific surface area and rich surface reaction sites showing a high adsorption affinity for pollutants ben moshe et al 2010 therefore colloids are potential carriers of environmental contaminants yan et al 2015 for cr contaminated sites the colloid facilitated transport of cr will affect the migration and transformation of cr which presents as an important mechanism for the migration of contaminant in soil and groundwater system grolimund and borkovec 2005 li and zhou 2010 however the study on the migration and transformation of colloid facilitated transport of

the modulate mechanism of the dynamic repartition of dissolved cr and colloidal cr in soil porewater the retention of cr in soil and the flux of colloidal and dissolved cr discharged to the saturation aquifer were analyzed third the mechanisms driving conversion of cr between cr vi and cr iii were studied last a mathematical and numerical model of colloid facilitated cr migration and transformation under variable saturation variable density conditions were constructed and the contaminants transport in different fluctuation scenarios were analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials in general the coastal area near river estuary often presents a particular aquifer where clay layer and sand layer alternately appear abunada et al 2021 jamaluddin et al 2016 therefore the laboratory experiment column was designed with two layers the upper cr contaminated sandy clay soil at the height of 20 50 cm and the lower clean sandy soil at the height of 0 20 cm figure s1 both soil samples were collected from a coastal area of shanghai city china the soils have passed through a 2 mm sieve to keep a uniform size distribution the cr concentration in the upper contaminated soil was 7379 mg kg the physico chemical properties of the upper contaminated soil were presented in table 1 and distribution of granularity density was presented in figure s2 the main mineral components in the contaminated soil are quartz microcline albite and clinochlore whereas the lower sandy soil contained the same minerals except microcline figure s3 the freshwater was made of deionized water and the seawater was taken from the coastal sea in the east of shanghai city china the properties of seawater are presented in table s1 2 2 fluctuation system the entire fluctuation system includes a columnar soil simulation device freshwater and seawater supply and drainage devices sensors and a data acquisition system figure s1 the column device was cylindrical made of plexiglass material and the inside of the device was set in a circle with a diameter of 15 cm and the height set to 60 cm according to the previous studies chen et al 2019 jia etal 2017 wei et al 2021 the overall soil filling height was 50 cm for the upper contaminated soil and the lower clean soil the porosities were 0 62 and 0 40 the pore volumes were 3287 cm3 and 1414 cm3 and the average moistures were 24 and 22 respectively the lower quartz sand layer and the upper contaminated soil were separated by three layers of filters with a pore size of 10 μm a normal colloid size john et al 1989 in order to explore the changing laws of eh water content and water pressure during the experiment ten sensors were arranged in the entire column device the details were presented in text s1 the soil and porewater samples after each water level fluctuation were obtained and five sampling ports were arranged on one side of the device at the same height as the sensors to analyze the profile changes of cr in porewater and soil after different fluctuations during the whole experiment freshwater and seawater were alternating recharged and discharged by a peristaltic pump and the discharged water were collected after each fluctuation 2 3 experiment procedures the whole experiment process was divided into six phases in total the initial water level of the soil column was 0 cm corresponding to the height of the column bottom during each water level fluctuation freshwater or seawater was supplied from the bottom alternatively the water supply was stopped when the water level rose to 50 cm and the water level was kept stable before discharge process there was a pause interval lasting about 30 minutes between each fluctuation as a stable period of low water level phases i iii and v were the freshwater fluctuations phases and phases ii iv and vi corresponded to the seawater fluctuation phases the whole experiment process lasted for 15 hours figure s4 during the whole experiment the flow rates of freshwater and seawater supply and discharge were set to 13 ml min six effluents were collected during the water table dropping stages in the six phases for the discharge cr measurement the concentrations of elements in solution were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes agilent america a turbidimeter 2100q hach america was used to determine colloid concentration according to the corresponding relationship between solution turbidity and colloid concentration tang et al 2020 the morphological characterization and surface element composition of the colloids and soil samples were investigated by transmission electron microscope energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy tem eds fei netherlands the binding energy of atoms cr fe were determined by a kratos axis ultra dld spectrometer xps shimadzu japan the detailed analysis methods are described in text s2 2 4 numerical modeling a colloid facilitated cr transport model during the alternating fluctuation of freshwater and seawater was constructed with the attempt to quantify cr transport fluxes under different fluctuation scenarios this model consisted of three necessary parts the variable saturation hydrodynamic model the variable density flow model and the colloid facilitated cr transport model which considered the reaction network of cr the conceptual diagram of model structure was presented in figure s5 the flow model considering density variation was presented in text s3 in the variable saturated soil the process of colloid migration and cr migration were carried out simultaneously the first order kinetic model was applied to describe migration process of colloid this model is widely used to characterize adsorption and desorption process of suspended particles on the surface of soil particles goldberg et al 2007 based on the continuum approach chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2014 zhang et al 2010 the specific colloid migration process can be generalized as follows 1 θ ρ b k 1 c c o l t c c o l θ t d c c o l u c c o l k 2 c c o l 0 where c c o l is the concentration of colloids in suspension c c o l is the concentration of colloids attached on the solid matrix k1 and k2 are the colloid adsorption and desorption rate coefficients respectively ρ b denotes the bulk density of the solid matrix d is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient considering the fluid diffusion θ is the fluid s volume fraction and u is the darcy velocity m s the colloid migration process is also accompanied by the co migration process of cr which mainly exist in the porewater in two forms dissolved cr and colloidal cr these two forms are simulated as two components in the model and there is a kinetic exchange process between them the migration process of dissolved cr also considers the first order adsorption process to the soil matrix surface the dissolved cr and colloidal cr migration processes were generalized as follows 2 θ ρ b k 5 c d i s t c d i s θ t d c d i s u c d i s s 3 s 4 θ r i 3 θ c f a c t c f a c θ t d e c f a c u c f a c s 3 s 4 0 4 s 3 k 3 c d i s c c o l 5 s 4 k 4 c f a c where c d i s is the concentration of dissolved cr c f a c is the

cr is presented in text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydro geochemical conditions the eh and water content at different heights were monitored to reflect the hydro geochemical conditions in the whole fluctuation processes overall the eh values in the lower clean soil were much lower than that in the upper contaminated soil layer during the entire fluctuations the eh in the lower sandy soil layer 5 cm and 15 cm decreased at the dropping water table stages after phase i with freshwater fluctuation especially the eh at the height of 15 cm has dropped significantly figure s6 and the eh at this height was smaller than that of 5 cm the highest eh in the top 45 cm depth could be resulted from the dissolved oxygen in the soil air there was much difference for the eh in the upper contaminated soil layer between seawater and freshwater fluctuations specifically it first declined and then increased when seawater table dropped whereas first increased and then declined during the freshwater dropping stages figure s6 the significant decrease of eh was observed at these heights at the water table rising stage the water content of the upper soil was relatively large due to the hydration swelling effect of clay components li et al 2019 with the injection of groundwater the lower layer became an obvious confined aquifer due to the existence of clay components in the contaminated soil with poor permeability overlay the sand layer figure s7 and the maximum hydraulic head of the confined sand layer reached 106 cm figure s8 the high hydraulic head made the skeleton of overlay clay particles loose and the water content of upper layer dropped significantly due to the pressure release at the stabilization stage of high water table 3 2 formation and transport of colloid the water fluctuation induced formation of colloids in the soil porewater the colloid concentrations ranged from 3 mg l to 550 mg l basically the higher colloid concentration was observed in the soil porewater after freshwater fluctuations than that in the soil porewater after seawater fluctuations fig 1 a probably due to the seawater fluctuation induced more soil colloids downward migration out of the column than the freshwater fluctuation after six freshwater and seawater fluctuations microcline was found in the lower sand layer and the peak of microcline was relatively high at the height of 5 cm fig 1b compared with the composition of the initial lower clean sand soil figure s3 it can be inferred that the colloid was mainly composed of microcline kalsi3o8 water gravity brought colloid downward migration which was supported by the higher colloid concentration in the lower layer than that in the upper layer fig 1a it is significant that the colloid concentration at the lower sand layer 5 cm and 15 cm decreased greatly after each seawater fluctuation compared to the after each freshwater fluctuation this could be related to the fact that a large number of colloids was carried out of the soil during seawater fluctuations which was further verified by the higher colloid concentration in the collected effluent in seawater fluctuation than that in each previous freshwater fluctuation fig 1c the average sizes of colloids in the effluent after each fluctuation were between 800 1500 nm fig 1c however the seawater fluctuation brought larger particle of colloid 1000 1800 nm than the previous freshwater fluctuation 800 1200 nm fig 1d which may be attributed to the broke down of large size soil due to high ionic strength 0 22 m in the seawater table s1 the previous work showed that more hematite colloids were released from glass beads at 0 01 m sodium nitrate than at 0 001 m kallay et al 1986 this behavior was justified by agreement of the observations with trends in the energy barrier height calculated using constant potential of the double layer interaction kallay et al 1986 the particle detachment was promoted with increasing ionic strength kallay et al 1986 rijnaarts et al reported that the deposition of colloid could be suppressed in more saline environments like sea water with high ionic strength 0 1 m rijnaarts et al 1999 the ionic strength of initial seawater used in this study was 0 22 m and that of the effluent after every seawater fluctuation were all higher than 0 1 m such higher ionic strengths could inhibit colloid deposition by steric repulsion rijnaarts et al 1999 in addition the higher ionic strength decreased the electrostatic attraction between the colloids and the matrix surface due to the fact that bivalent cations ca2 and mg2 increase partially screened the negative charges on the colloid zhuang and jin 2003 the higher colloid in seawater fluctuation effluent was positively corresponding to their higher ionic strength figure s9 in addition the zeta potentials of the colloids in the effluents after seawater fluctuations were 0 41 4 87 mv while they were 14 6 19 7 mv after freshwater fluctuations figure s9 smaller zeta potential absolute value in the seawater fluctuation effluent indicated that the colloid tend to agglomerate hu et al 2021 resulting in the larger colloid formation fig 1d the tem images showed that the colloid after freshwater fluctuation at phase i was obviously flocculent dispersed and irregular in shape and extremely polydisperse fig 2 a while the colloids after the seawater fluctuation at phase vi were clearly agglomerated forming granular colloids fig 2b further observation found that the elements of fe mn and o were well associated with the colloid distribution after seawater fluctuation which were presumed to be fe mn oxide minerals in addition the composition elements of al k si and o occurred corresponding well with the colloid distribution agreeing with clay microcline composition fig 1b 3 3 dynamic repartition of cr in dissolved and colloid phases the fluctuation brought downward migration of cr and dynamically modulated dissolved and colloid cr repartition the water gravity is the main factor leading to the water flow and promoting the transport of cr in the vertical profile another reason is the higher ph values in the lower sand layer than that in the upper contaminated layer after each fluctuation fig 3 the cr vi was mainly presented as oxygen containing anion cro4 2 in the porewater which compete with oh chen et al 2017 therefore higher ph in lower sand layer favored transport of cr vi the reduction of cr vi into cr iii occurred during the migration and the concentration of dissolved cr iii and cr vi in the upper contaminated soil was higher than that in the lower sandy soil fig 3a and b for example the dissolved cr iii and cr vi at the height of 35 cm were 460 2150 mg l 1 and 2167 3543 mg l 1 respectively while they were only 10 1304 mg l 1 and 0 13 142 mg l 1 at the height of 15 cm nevertheless the ratios of dissolved cr iii to the total cr at 35 cm height was 9 58 57 8 much lower than 10 5 99 9 at 15 cm height table s3 which corresponded well to the lower eh at 15 cm than that at 35 cm fig 3d reflecting the influence of reducing environment on the conversion of cr vi to cr iii the discharge of freshwater and seawater fluctuation caused water table drop which brought colloid and cr into the underside saturated aquifer text s4 seawater fluctuation induced more colloid and cr into effluent than the previous freshwater there were over 94 cr presence with colloid in both freshwater and seawater fluctuation except phase v and over 95 cr iii was dominant in both dissolved and colloid phases table 2 figure s10 the pearson correlation coefficient between colloid and colloidal cr iii was 0 64 which reflected a strong correlation figure s11 it can be concluded that cr migration was facilitated by colloid the tem analysis showed that cr has a good association with si al k and o indicating that cr was carried by the colloid microcline for the facilitated transport meanwhile cr was also associated with fe and mn fig 2b it could be that cr vi was reduced into cr iii by reduced fe and mn and cr iii might precipitate as fexcr1 x oh 3 with fe iii wanner et al 2011 3 4 dynamic repartition of the soil retained cr after six fluctuations cr concentrations in the upper contaminated soil were between 3941 mg kg 1 and 4885 mg kg 1 with up to 47 decrease compared to 7379 mg kg 1 of the original concentration table 1 in correspondence cr increased in the lower sandy soil especially cr increased 4 times at 15 cm height after the last seawater fluctuation than that in first freshwater fluctuation fig 4 the results again confirmed that the fluctuation greatly induced the downward migration of cr from the upper contaminated soil both cr vi and cr iii retained in the upper contaminated layer was significantly reduced from the first freshwater fluctuation in phase i to the last seawater fluctuation in phase vi whereas the soil retained cr iii was obviously increased in the lower contaminated layer 25 cm which could be resulted from the combination of the low eh environment at this height fig 2d and the downward migration of a large amount of colloidal cr iii the cr from the upper contaminated soil accumulated in the lower sandy soil even at 5 cm there was still 24 5 mg kg cr with cr mainly existing as cr iii fig 4 the xps analysis was further employed to characterize the chemical compositions of cr and fe in the soil surface at different heights during phases iii vi the binding energies of cr 2p 3 2 and cr 2p 1 2 at around 577 2 and 587 1 ev were attributed to cr iii while cr vi compounds were characterized by binding energies at 579 6 and 589 1 ev dong et al 2011 figure s12 after each fluctuation cr mainly existed as cr vi in the upper contaminated soil and in the lower sandy soil cr iii was dominant the seawater fluctuation induced more cr vi reduction in the upper contaminated soil and less cr vi reduction in the lower sandy soil the lower cr iii retained in the lower sand layer was probably caused by discharge of more colloidal cr iii into the effluent by seawater the peaks at 725 4 ev binding energy of fe 2p 1 2 and at 710 3 712 6 ev and 717 8 720 2 binding energies corresponding to the form of fe iii including fe2o3 wei et al 2021 appeared as the main form of fe in the whole soil column fe ii species were found at binding energy of 714 1 ev rajan et al 2020 figure s13 the fe ii species in the upper contaminated soil gradually decreased after each fluctuation from 28 6 in phase iii to 10 0 in phase vi which indicated the gradual consumption of fe ii involved in the reduction process of cr vi to cr iii this observation agreed with the association of cr with fe in the colloid fig 2b 3 5 model prediction a colloid facilitated cr transport model was constructed following the variable density unsaturated flow the model parameters were calibrated by the experimental data figure s16 figure s17 the calibrated model parameters were shown in table s4 in order to further explore the migration of colloidal cr during the alternating fluctuation of seawater and freshwater in the actual coastal zone a two dimensional numerical model was constructed figure s18 the details of the model set up were presented in text s5 the calculated distribution of salinity water content colloid colloidal cr iii and cr vi concentration and at different days were shown in fig 5 and figure s19 with the gradual intrusion of seawater the salinity of porewater in the lower layer first increased and gradually migrated to the left boundary the water level rise obviously led to an increase in the water content of the upper soil the simulation results showed that the migration flux of colloidal cr iii through the bottom of the pollution source was significantly increased in the seawater fluctuation compared with the freshwater fluctuation and the higher migration flux occurred at the water level rising stage figure s20a in addition the freshwater fluctuation caused more colloidal cr vi to migrate through the pollution source bottom during the water level rising stage figure s20b the rising seawater level led to the downward migration of more colloid which corresponded well to the colloidal cr iii variations figure s20c after the seawater fluctuation amplitude increased to 1 m more colloids and colloidal cr were discharged to the left freshwater boundary during 90 180 d which reduced the migration flux of cr at the bottom of pollution source figure s21 in particular in the cases of freshwater and seawater fluctuation with lager amplitudes the greater rising water level speed caused more contaminants to migrate downward during this period besides the migration flux of fe ii gradually decreased during the whole fluctuation process figure s20d furthermore the variations of the total amount of cr in the pollution source after multiple rounds of alternating fluctuations were calculated after four rounds of alternating fluctuations lasting for one year the total cr in suspension decreased by 15 7 while the total soil retained cr decreased by 9 3 after eight rounds of fluctuation lasting for two years the total cr in suspension further decreased by 23 7 and the corresponding soil retained cr decreased by 13 8 the fluctuation induced downward migration of cr gradually decreased with the increasing fluctuation round in a soil contaminated site figure s22 4 conclusions and environmental implications this study revealed that the alternating fluctuations of seawater and freshwater in the groundwater table fluctuation zone at coastal areas had a great impact on the migration and transformation of cr in the soil specifically such a fluctuation brought downward migration of cr from upper contaminated soil and induced reduction of cr vi into cr iii an obvious increase of dissolved and soil retained cr iii was observed at the lower layers of soil which was attributed to the low eh environment and the downward migration of colloidal cr iii besides compared with the previous freshwater fluctuation seawater fluctuations caused a higher mass fluxes of colloid which can facilitate the migration of cr iii to enter the lower saturated groundwater aquifer the modeling showed the consistent results with the experiment the migration flux of colloidal cr iii through the bottom of the pollution source greatly increased at the seawater rising stage overall we quantitatively calculated the cr exchange flux in groundwater table fluctuation through experiments and simulations and found the important role of colloids in the cr migration process we revealed that groundwater table fluctuation increases the pollution risk of the saturated aquifer below the soil contaminated site especially after seawater fluctuation the results of the study provide guidance for the geochemical process of cr in the coastal area which are further of great significance to the risk control of the disturbance of cr on the environment and human health synopsis the seawater and freshwater alternating fluctuations induced the generation of colloids which could facilitate downward migration of cr from upper contaminated soil accompanied with the reduction of cr vi into cr iii declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of

15953,seawater seasonal fluctuation results in its close interaction with freshwater in the coastal area which may affect behavior of contaminants there this study was conducted to explore the transport and transformation of soil colloid and associated cr during freshwater and seawater alternating fluctuations by laboratory experiment and numerical simulation such a fluctuation brought downward migration of cr from upper contaminated soil and induced reduction of cr vi into cr iii an obvious increase of retained cr iii was observed at the lower layers of soil due to the reducing environment more importantly the colloids with average sizes between 800 1500 nm was formed during the fluctuation and mainly composed of microcline and fe mn oxides minerals which determined the cr transport compared with the previous freshwater fluctuation seawater fluctuations generated more and larger sized colloids due to its high ionic strength these colloids carried over 94 cr in the effluent and cr iii accounted for over 95 of total cr a colloid facilitated cr transport modeling showed that the soil retained cr decreased by about 14 after eight rounds of fluctuation on an actual

fluctuation of freshwater and seawater was constructed with the attempt to quantify cr transport fluxes under different fluctuation scenarios this model consisted of three necessary parts the variable saturation hydrodynamic model the variable density flow model and the colloid facilitated cr transport model which considered the reaction network of cr the conceptual diagram of model structure was presented in figure s5 the flow model considering density variation was presented in text s3 in the variable saturated soil the process of colloid migration and cr migration were carried out simultaneously the first order kinetic model was applied to describe migration process of colloid this model is widely used to characterize adsorption and desorption process of suspended particles on the surface of soil particles goldberg et al 2007 based on the continuum approach chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2014 zhang et al 2010 the specific colloid migration process can be generalized as follows 1 θ ρ b k 1 c c o l t c c o l θ t d c c o l u c c o l k 2 c c o l 0 where c c o l is the concentration of colloids in suspension c c o l is the concentration of colloids attached on the solid matrix k1 and k2 are the colloid adsorption and desorption rate coefficients respectively ρ b denotes the bulk density of the solid matrix d is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient considering the fluid diffusion θ is the fluid s volume fraction and u is the darcy velocity m s the colloid migration process is also accompanied by the co migration process of cr which mainly exist in the porewater in two forms dissolved cr and colloidal cr these two forms are simulated as two components in the model and there is a kinetic exchange process between them the migration process of dissolved cr also considers the first order adsorption process to the soil matrix surface the dissolved cr and colloidal cr migration processes were generalized as follows 2 θ ρ b k 5 c d i s t c d i s θ t d c d i s u

cr is presented in text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydro geochemical conditions the eh and water content at different heights were monitored to reflect the hydro geochemical conditions in the whole fluctuation processes overall the eh values in the lower clean soil were much lower than that in the upper contaminated soil layer during the entire fluctuations the eh in the lower sandy soil layer 5 cm and 15 cm decreased at the dropping water table stages after phase i with freshwater fluctuation especially the eh at the height of 15 cm has dropped significantly figure s6 and the eh at this height was smaller than that of 5 cm the highest eh in the top 45 cm depth could be resulted from the dissolved oxygen in the soil air there was much difference for the eh in the upper contaminated soil layer between seawater and freshwater fluctuations specifically it first declined and then increased when seawater table dropped whereas first increased and then declined during the freshwater dropping stages figure s6 the significant decrease of eh was observed at these heights at the water table rising stage the water content of the upper soil was relatively large due to the hydration swelling effect of clay components li et al 2019 with the injection of groundwater the lower layer became an obvious confined aquifer due to the existence of clay components in the contaminated soil with poor permeability overlay the sand layer figure s7 and the maximum hydraulic head of the confined sand layer reached 106 cm figure s8 the high hydraulic head made the skeleton of overlay clay particles loose and the water content of upper layer dropped significantly due to the pressure release at the stabilization stage of high water table 3 2 formation and transport of colloid the water fluctuation induced formation of colloids in the soil porewater the colloid concentrations ranged from 3 mg l to 550 mg l basically the higher colloid concentration was observed in the soil porewater after freshwater fluctuations than that in the soil porewater after seawater fluctuations fig 1 a probably due to the seawater fluctuation induced more soil colloids downward migration out of the column than the freshwater fluctuation after six freshwater and seawater fluctuations microcline was found in the lower sand layer and the peak of microcline was relatively high at the height of 5 cm fig 1b compared with the composition of the initial lower clean sand soil figure s3 it can be inferred that the colloid was mainly composed of microcline kalsi3o8 water gravity brought colloid downward migration which was supported by the higher colloid concentration in the lower layer than that in the upper layer fig 1a it is significant that the colloid concentration at the lower sand layer 5 cm and 15 cm decreased greatly after each seawater fluctuation compared to the after each freshwater fluctuation this could be related to the fact that a large number of colloids was carried out of the soil during seawater fluctuations which was further verified by the higher colloid concentration in the collected effluent in seawater fluctuation than that in each previous freshwater fluctuation fig 1c the average sizes of colloids in the effluent after each fluctuation were between 800 1500 nm fig 1c however the seawater fluctuation brought larger particle of colloid 1000 1800 nm than the previous freshwater fluctuation 800 1200 nm fig 1d which may be attributed to the broke down of large size soil due to high ionic strength 0 22 m in the seawater table s1 the previous work showed that more hematite colloids were released from glass beads at 0 01 m sodium nitrate than at 0 001 m kallay et al 1986 this behavior was justified by agreement of the observations with trends in the energy barrier height calculated using constant potential of the double layer interaction kallay et al 1986 the particle detachment was promoted with increasing ionic strength kallay et al 1986 rijnaarts et al reported that the deposition of colloid could be suppressed in more saline environments like sea water with high ionic strength 0 1 m rijnaarts et al 1999 the ionic strength of initial seawater used in this study was 0 22 m and that of the effluent after every seawater fluctuation were all higher than 0 1 m such higher ionic strengths could inhibit colloid deposition by steric repulsion rijnaarts et al 1999 in addition the higher ionic strength decreased the electrostatic attraction between the colloids and the matrix surface due to the fact that bivalent cations ca2 and mg2 increase partially screened the negative charges on the colloid zhuang and jin 2003 the higher colloid in seawater fluctuation effluent was positively corresponding to their higher ionic strength figure s9 in addition the zeta potentials of the colloids in the effluents after seawater fluctuations were 0 41 4 87 mv while they were 14 6 19 7 mv after freshwater fluctuations figure s9 smaller zeta potential absolute value in the seawater fluctuation effluent indicated that the colloid tend to agglomerate hu et al 2021 resulting in the larger colloid formation fig 1d the tem images showed that the colloid after freshwater fluctuation at phase i was obviously flocculent dispersed and irregular in shape and extremely polydisperse fig 2 a while the colloids after the seawater fluctuation at phase vi were clearly agglomerated forming granular colloids fig 2b further observation found that the elements of fe mn and o were well associated with the colloid distribution after seawater fluctuation which were presumed to be fe mn oxide minerals in addition the composition elements of al k si and o occurred corresponding well with the colloid distribution agreeing with clay microcline composition fig 1b 3 3 dynamic repartition of cr in dissolved and colloid phases the fluctuation brought downward migration of cr and dynamically modulated dissolved and colloid cr repartition the water gravity is the main factor leading to the water flow and promoting the transport of cr in the vertical profile another reason is the higher ph values in the lower sand layer than that in the upper contaminated layer after each fluctuation fig 3 the cr vi was mainly presented as oxygen containing anion cro4 2 in the porewater which compete with oh chen et al 2017 therefore higher ph in lower sand layer favored transport of cr vi the reduction of cr vi into cr iii occurred during the migration and the concentration of dissolved cr iii and cr vi in the upper contaminated soil was higher than that in the lower sandy soil fig 3a and b for example the dissolved cr iii and cr vi at the height of 35 cm were 460 2150 mg l 1 and 2167 3543 mg l 1 respectively while they were only 10 1304 mg l 1 and 0 13 142 mg l 1 at the height of 15 cm nevertheless the ratios of dissolved cr iii to the total cr at 35 cm height was 9 58 57 8 much lower than 10 5 99 9 at 15 cm height table s3 which corresponded well to the lower eh at 15 cm than that at 35 cm fig 3d reflecting the influence of reducing environment on the conversion of cr vi to cr iii the discharge of freshwater and seawater fluctuation caused water table drop which brought colloid and cr into the underside saturated aquifer text s4 seawater fluctuation induced more colloid and cr into effluent than the previous freshwater there were over 94 cr presence with colloid in both freshwater and seawater fluctuation except phase v and over 95 cr iii was dominant in both dissolved and colloid phases table 2 figure s10 the pearson correlation coefficient between colloid and colloidal cr iii was 0 64 which reflected a strong correlation figure s11 it can be concluded that cr migration was facilitated by colloid the tem analysis showed that cr has a good association with si al k and o indicating that cr was carried by the colloid microcline for the facilitated transport meanwhile cr was also associated with fe and mn fig 2b it could be that cr vi was reduced into cr iii by reduced fe and mn and cr iii might precipitate as fexcr1 x oh 3 with fe iii wanner et al 2011 3 4 dynamic repartition of the soil retained cr after six fluctuations cr concentrations in the upper contaminated soil were between 3941 mg kg 1 and 4885 mg kg 1 with up to 47 decrease compared to 7379 mg kg 1 of the original concentration table 1 in correspondence cr increased in the lower sandy soil especially cr increased 4 times at 15 cm height after the last seawater fluctuation than that in first freshwater fluctuation fig 4 the results again confirmed that the fluctuation greatly induced the downward migration of cr from the upper contaminated soil both cr vi and cr iii retained in the upper contaminated layer was significantly reduced from the first freshwater fluctuation in phase i to the last seawater fluctuation in phase vi whereas the soil retained cr iii was obviously increased in the lower contaminated layer 25 cm which could be resulted from the combination of the low eh environment at this height fig 2d and the downward migration of a large amount of colloidal cr iii the cr from the upper contaminated soil accumulated in the lower sandy soil even at 5 cm there was still 24 5 mg kg cr with cr mainly existing as cr iii fig 4 the xps analysis was further employed to characterize the chemical compositions of cr and fe in the soil surface at different heights during phases iii vi the binding energies of cr 2p 3 2 and cr 2p 1 2 at around 577 2 and 587 1 ev were attributed to cr iii while cr vi compounds were characterized by binding energies at 579 6 and 589 1 ev dong et al 2011 figure s12 after each fluctuation cr mainly existed as cr vi in the upper contaminated soil and in the lower sandy soil cr iii was dominant the seawater fluctuation induced more cr vi reduction in the upper contaminated soil and less cr vi reduction in the lower sandy soil the lower cr iii retained in the lower sand layer was probably caused by discharge of more colloidal cr iii into the effluent by seawater the peaks at 725 4 ev binding energy of fe 2p 1 2 and at 710 3 712 6 ev and 717 8 720 2 binding energies corresponding to the form of fe iii including fe2o3 wei et al 2021 appeared as the main form of fe in the whole soil column fe ii species were found at binding energy of 714 1 ev rajan et al 2020 figure s13 the fe ii species in the upper contaminated soil gradually decreased after each fluctuation from 28 6 in phase iii to 10 0 in phase vi which indicated the gradual consumption of fe ii involved in the reduction process of cr vi to cr iii this observation agreed with the association of cr with fe in the colloid fig 2b 3 5 model prediction a colloid facilitated cr transport model was constructed following the variable density unsaturated flow the model parameters were calibrated by the experimental data figure s16 figure s17 the calibrated model parameters were shown in table s4 in order to further explore the migration of colloidal cr during the alternating fluctuation of seawater and freshwater in the actual coastal zone a two dimensional numerical model was constructed figure s18 the details of the model set up were presented in text s5 the calculated distribution of salinity water content colloid colloidal cr iii and cr vi concentration and at different days were shown in fig 5 and figure s19 with the gradual intrusion of seawater the salinity of porewater in the lower layer first increased and gradually migrated to the left boundary the water level rise obviously led to an increase in the water content of the upper soil the simulation results showed that the migration flux of colloidal cr iii through the bottom of the pollution source was significantly increased in the seawater fluctuation compared with the freshwater fluctuation and the higher migration flux occurred at the water level rising stage figure s20a in addition the freshwater fluctuation caused more colloidal cr vi to migrate through the pollution source bottom during the water level rising stage figure s20b the rising seawater level led to the downward migration of more colloid which corresponded well to the colloidal cr iii variations figure s20c after the seawater fluctuation amplitude increased to 1 m more colloids and colloidal cr were discharged to the left freshwater boundary during 90 180 d which reduced the migration flux of cr at the bottom of pollution source figure s21 in particular in the cases of freshwater and seawater fluctuation with lager amplitudes the greater rising water level speed caused more contaminants to migrate downward during this period besides the migration flux of fe ii gradually decreased during the whole fluctuation process figure s20d furthermore the variations of the total amount of cr in the pollution source after multiple rounds of alternating fluctuations were calculated after four rounds of alternating fluctuations lasting for one year the total cr in suspension decreased by 15 7 while the total soil retained cr decreased by 9 3 after eight rounds of fluctuation lasting for two years the total cr in suspension further decreased by 23 7 and the corresponding soil retained cr decreased by 13 8 the fluctuation induced downward migration of cr gradually decreased with the increasing fluctuation round in a soil contaminated site figure s22 4 conclusions and environmental implications this study revealed that the alternating fluctuations of seawater and freshwater in the groundwater table fluctuation zone at coastal areas had a great impact on the migration and transformation of cr in the soil specifically such a fluctuation brought downward migration of cr from upper contaminated soil and induced reduction of cr vi into cr iii an obvious increase of dissolved and soil retained cr iii was observed at the lower layers of soil which was attributed to the low eh environment and the downward migration of colloidal cr iii besides compared with the previous freshwater fluctuation seawater fluctuations caused a higher mass fluxes of colloid which can facilitate the migration of cr iii to enter the lower saturated groundwater aquifer the modeling showed the consistent results with the experiment the migration flux of colloidal cr iii through the bottom of the pollution source greatly increased at the seawater rising stage overall we quantitatively calculated the cr exchange flux in groundwater table fluctuation through experiments and simulations and found the important role of colloids in the cr migration process we revealed that groundwater table fluctuation increases the pollution risk of the saturated aquifer below the soil contaminated site especially after seawater fluctuation the results of the study provide guidance for the geochemical process of cr in the coastal area which are further of great significance to the risk control of the disturbance of cr on the environment and human health synopsis the seawater and freshwater alternating fluctuations induced the generation of colloids which could facilitate downward migration of cr from upper contaminated soil accompanied with the reduction of cr vi into cr iii declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of

15954,reduction of fe iii is the rate limiting step of iron induced fenton like systems such as the iron peroxydisulfate system reducing agents ras were frequently employed as electron donors to directly reduce fe iii to further promote the formation of reactive oxygen species ros mainly including hydroxyl radical oh sulfate radical so4 and ferryl ion fe iv however the intrinsic distinctions among these ros cause the substrate specific reactivity towards oxidation of diverse organic contaminants in this study various ras representative solid amorphous boron a boron and dissolved hydroxylamine ha were added to enhance the fe iii pds system for investigating the substrate specific reactivity of ros it is demonstrated that ras remarkably boost the fe iii fe ii cycles to produce oh so4 and fe iv in the ras fe iii pds systems based on the results of epr analysis quenching tests and chemical probe analysis furthermore the different yields of methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 indicate that the distribution of multiple oxidizing species changed with various factors i e type and dosage of ras added solution ph fe iii and pds dosage this work provides the possibility for the adjustment of oxidation selectivity of ras fe iii pds systems by regulating contribution of radicals and non radical for oxidizing organic contaminants due to the substrate specific reactivity of oh

graphical abstract keywords reductants peroxydisulfate fenton like reaction reactive oxygen species fe iii fe ii cycle 1 introduction recently iron mediated fenton like activation of persulfates peroxymonosulfate pms and peroxydisulfate pds are widely investigated due to their high efficiencies for producing highly reactive oxygen species ros to oxidize a wide variety of organic pollutants eqs 1 2 lee von gunten and kim 2020 xiao et al 2020 ros can be rapidly produced via fenton like reactions between fe ii and persulfates however the sluggish kinetic of fe ii recovery is the inherent drawback and retard the long lasting generation of ros eqs 3 4 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 wu et al 2017 therefore a myriad of literatures devoted to promote regeneration of fe ii in recent years which primarily focuses on the input of extra energy e g light irradiation electric filed and ultrasound and co catalysts e g iron chelators and electron donors to boost fenton like oxidation by

hydroxyl radical oh sulfate radical so4 and ferrly ion feivo2 fe iv are claimed as ros in this work and generally produced in fe induced fenton like systems dong et al 2020a wang et al 2018a however the distinct properties redox potential lifetime and reaction mechanism of these ros cause substrate specific reactivity to oxidize diverse organic contaminants lee et al 2020 wang et al 2018a the previous literatures mainly focus on the activation of peroxides and degradation of organic contaminants but the substrate specific reactivity and distribution of ros in ras enhanced fenton like systems remain little noticed lei et al 2015 li et al 2016 xing et al 2018 zou et al 2013 from our point of view taking advantage of the peculiarity of each ros and regulating the distribution of various ros can enhance the degradation of organic pollutants and increase the utilization ratio of ros moreover the input of ras in fenton like systems is virtually a trade off between rapid generation and unwished consumption of ros and prodromic peroxides zhou et al 2021 the ras induced acceleration of fe iii reduction and ros quenching simultaneously occur in the ras enhanced fenton like systems which is related to the intrinsic properties of ras including pka redox potential by products from ras and so on for instance homogeneous ras have strong reductivity inevitable ros quenching but are hard to recycle due to homogeneity therefore it is critical to choose suitable ras in practical application but it is lack of method to evaluate the flexibility of ras in fenton like systems in this study we for the first time systematically discussed the ras enhanced iron pds systems with focusing on substrate specific reactivity of ros towards oxidation of a wide array of organic contaminants regulating the distribution of ros and flexibility of ras overall the introduction of various ras i e amorphous boron a boron ha l aa l ce na2so3 mos2 ws2 significantly improves the oxidation capability of the fe iii pds system and the production of ros various ros were qualitatively and semi quantitatively analyzed by epr analysis quenching tests and chemical probe tests

performed in 100 ml deionized water at a glass beaker under constant stirring with a ptee blade 300 rpm the temperature of batch experiments was controlled at 25 1 0 c with thermostatic water bath each solution with desired dosages of organic pollutants and ferric salt fe iii or fe ii was prepared before reaction and then the initial solution ph was adjusted by sulfuric acid then the desired dosages of pds and ras were simultaneously added to initiate the reactions at specific time intervals approximately 1 0 3 0 ml samples were withdrawn and filtered 0 22 μm membrane to analyze the concentrations of target contaminants quenched by excess sodium thiosulfate and iron species chelated with chromogenic agent 2 3 analysis of reactive oxygen species the generation of reactive radicals e g oh and so4 was qualitatively detected by election paramagnetic resonance epr bruker emx plus technique using dmpo as a trapping agent text s1 the quenching tests were then conducted to qualitatively analyze the contribution of so4 and oh on degradation of contaminants tba and etoh were selected as quenching agents to analyze the contribution of each ros on contaminant degradation moreover it has been reported that tpa can react with oh to produce the characteristic product of htpa via hydroxylation linxiang et al 2004 tpa was thus used as a chemical probe to qualitatively and semi quantitatively identify the production of oh in addition pmso can be oxidized by feivo2 via oxygen transfer to produce a specific product pmso2 which is different from oh and so4 induced oxidation of pmso pestovsky et al 2005 pmso was thus used as the chemical probe to analyze the production of fe iv and the distribution of ros radicals oh and so4 and non radical fe iv by detecting the concentration of pmso2 in the ras enhanced fe iii pds systems 2 4 analytical methods the concentrations of organics pe dep dmp smx bpa nb ba cbz htpa pmso pmso2 were detected by a hplc shimadzu

respectively the ph of the reaction solution was measured by a phs 3c meter rex china the concentrations of iron species total dissolved iron and dissolved fe ii were also measured using a spectrophotometric method with 1 10 phenanthroline as a chromogenic agent text s3 zhou et al 2020b 3 results and discussion 3 1 substrate specific reactivity of ros after the debate of primary ros in the fe ii pds system over the past few years three types of ros oh so4 and fe iv are probably produced based on the results of various qualitative and semi quantitative analysis anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 dong et al 2020a wang et al 2018a each ros oh so4 and fe iv has its own characteristics showing that they react with substrates at different rate constants table 1 and text s4 among these ros oh is a powerful oxidant in conventional aops with high potentials of 2 7 v in acidic condition and 1 8 v in neutral condition buxton greenstock helman and ross 1988 lee et al 2020 moreover oh is widely used for broad spectrum removal of contaminants in waters due to its nonselective reaction at near diffusion controlled rates with organic compounds buxton et al 1988 however its susceptibility to chemical surroundings e g halide ions carbonates and nitrite strongly limits the diffusion range and utilization rate of oh xiao et al 2020 yang pignatello ma and mitch 2014 thus as an appealing alternative to oh based aops so4 based aops has received extensive attention in recent years due to properties of so4 for instance its high redox potential longer life time than oh and loose ph requirement enable it can transfer long distances to oxidize target pollutants buxton et al 1988 oh dong and lim 2016 xiao et al 2020 in addition so4 shows substrate specificity to selectively oxidize organic contaminants which is the main difference of these two radicals lee et al 2020 wojnarovits and takacs 2019 the second order reaction rate constants of so4 for oxidizing some organics are 2 or 3 orders of magnitude smaller than those for oh text s5 as a kind of non radical ros fe iv was recently found in iron pds systems and can oxidize organics which is regarded as the transient reactive intermediate wang et al 2018a it has been demonstrated that the inhibitory effects of background substrates such as inorganic ions e g no2 cl mn2 and hso3 and organic compounds e g aromatic substrates and aliphatic alcohols could be mitigated by the nonradical pathways buxton et al 1988 chen et al 2021 wojnarovits and takacs 2019 compared with oh so4 fe iv reacts with substrates e g pe nb at a rate of several orders of magnitude lower due to its relatively weak redox potentials table s5 bossmann et al 1998 the reactivity of fe iv is more selective towards organic contaminants containing electron rich moieties than so4 and it is influenced by solution ph fe oh 2 2 fe oh 3 h pka 2 0 while so4 is more ph independent bataineh pestovsky and bakac 2012 2016 lee et al 2020 furthermore each reactive oxygen species oh so4 and fe iv carry specific features for oxidizing organic compounds in this regard oh and so4 react with organic compounds via similar pathways i hydrogen abstraction ii electron transfer iii addition elimination and the difference lies in a preferred reaction pathway and the reaction kinetics lee et al 2020 the rate of oxidation by so4 is sensitivity to chemical surroundings such as the degree of alkylation and the type of functional groups and the preferred reaction pathway is influenced by the type and structure of organic compounds this is contrary to the reactivity of oh fe iv can also oxidize organic compounds via multiple pathways such as hydrogen atom and hydride transfer oxygen atom transfer and outer sphere electron transfer as well as electrophilic addition wang et al 2022 the similarities and differences exist between the oxidation behaviors of fe iv and that of oh so4 fe iv initially attacks aromatic rings through electrophilic addition like oh and so4 but subsequent addition elimination process is different wang et al 2022 thereinto the production of sulfone from sulfoxide e g dmso and pmso via oxygen atom transfer is unique to high valent iron species rather than radicals lee et al 2020 wang et al 2018a based on the above discussion radicals oh and so4 exhibit high and poor selective reactivity to oxidize organics however they are short lived and susceptive to nontarget matrix constituents despite fe iv shows lower reactivity its selectivity toward electron rich organics larger diffusion range and longer life time initiate a lot of optimism to degrade target compounds 5 fe ii s 2 o 8 2 h 2 o f e iv o 2 2 so 4 2 2 h 6 so 4 h 2 o h so 4 oh k 8 3 m 1 s 1 7 so 4 o h so 4 2 oh k 6 5 1 0 7 m 1 s

2020a with high rate constants considering that each ros performs specific reactivity towards various substrates dep and pe thus were selected as topical substrates to further investigate the discrepancy between oh so4 and fe iv in one sort of ros dominated systems oh in the uv h2o2 system so4 in the uv pds system wang shao gao lu and an 2018b high valent iron species fe iv fe v and fe vi in the k2feo4 system fig s1 zhu et al 2020 the experimental conditions are shown in text s6 and s7 fig 1 considering the interconversion from so4 to oh etoh and tba were selected as scavengers of oh k etoh oh 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 k tba oh 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 and so4 k etoh so4 1 6 107 m 1 s 1 k tba so4 4 0 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 due to their differentiable reactivities towards these two radicals huang wang yang guo and yu 2017 lai yan li and lai 2018 as can be seen in fig 1a the significant inhibition of tba indicates the dominance of oh in the uv h2o2 system dep and pe were both degraded via the reaction with oh due to its nonselective oxidation property on account of the stronger reactivity towards organic contaminants containing electron rich moieties of so4 the oxidation of dep in the uv pds system might be due to slow so4 reacting with h2o or oh to produce oh eqs 6 7 zhang chen and zhu 2016 which could also explain the similar quenching effect of tba and etoh on dep degradation in the uv pds system fig 1b moreover etoh could significantly inhibit pe degradation and the degradation ratio in the uv pds etoh system is similar to that in the uv system while identical concentration of tba exhibits unobvious inhibitory effect these results confirm the predominance of so4 in the uv pds system high valent iron species exhibits excellent activity to degrade pe but not to dep in the k2feo4 system illustrating the strong substrate selectivity in conclusion it is further demonstrated oh so4 and fe iv cause substrate specific reactivity to oxidize diverse organic contaminants 3 2 substrate specific reactivity of ras enhanced fe iii pds systems considering the differences of homogeneous and heterogeneous ras a boron and ha were added to the fe iii pds system for degradation of a wide variety of organic contaminants including antibiotics smx phenols bpa and pe phthalate esters dmp and dep organic dyes ao7 mo and rhb medicines cbz and aromatics ba and nb fig 2a depicts that the oxidation capacity for contaminants of the fe iii pds system is weak and the removal ratios of most contaminants are below 50 in the fe ii pds system considering the low contribution of ras induced direct activation of pds fig s2 and s3 a boron and ha can strongly enhance the fe iii pds system to oxidize these organic contaminants nevertheless these systems exhibit different degradation efficiency towards various substrates which is related to second order reaction rate constants between each ros and organic compounds fig 2b and text s5 for instance the rate constants between ros oh so4 and fe iv and pe are several orders of magnitude high than those of nb which causes higher degradation ratio of pe than nb in a boron and ha enhanced fe iii pds systems as can be seen in fig 2c the capability of ras is diverse from each other resulting from the different oxidation capability towards dep and pe thereinto the ha fe iii pds system manifests outstanding oxidation capacity to dep and pe while other ras can only boost pe degradation but not dep indicating that the pe degradation in ras except ha enhanced fe iii pds systems may be a nonradical or so4 dominated oxidation process based on the above results the performance of oxidation to organics in various ras enhanced fe iii pds systems are different resulting from the type of ros generated is different despite the similarity in the mechanism how they boost various organics degradation to an extent that each ras carries features that are associated to the production of ros e g reduction capacity thus it indicates that the possibility of utilizing ras discrepancy to produce ros to degrade organics specifically however the ras fe iii pds systems still demonstrated a high oxidation capacity for degradation of a wide array of organic contaminants 3 3 identification of ros for further analyzing the ros in ras fe iii pds system several qualitative and semi quantitative tests were conducted epr tests using dmpo as a spin trapping agent were carried out to identify the reactive radicals in the ras fe iii pds systems as shown in fig 3a there is almost no peak in spectrum from the fe iii pds system demonstrating that fe iii can t activate pds to generate ros along the same lines nothing but the extremely weak quartet line of dmpooh adduct hfsc of α n α h 14 9 g appears in the fe ii pds system nevertheless the stronger signals of dmpooh were observed in a boron and ha enhanced fe iii pds systems confirming that ras significantly accelerates the generation of ros the generation of dmpooh might also be attributed to the existence of fe iv wang et al 2018a and the conversion of dmpo so4 yang banerjee brudvig kim and pignatello 2018 not been limited to the oxidation of oh text s8 therefore a boron and ha enhanced fe iii pds systems probably involve multiple ros tpa is a chemical probe for oh which is utilized to qualitatively and semi quantitatively analyze the generation of oh shao et al 2015 fig 3b depicts that the characteristic product htpa continuously accumulates as the reaction proceeds in both a boron and ha enhanced fe iii pds systems which further demonstrates the ras promoted generation of oh moreover htpa is almost not detected in the fe ii pds system suggesting the low yield of oh pmso can be oxidized to pmso2 by the high valent iron via an oxygen atom transfer which is different from the case of radicals bossmann et al 1998 sharma 2010 as a probe of fe iv 10 53 μm pmso was decomposed within 30 min however pmso2 was not detected in the fe ⅲ pds system fig 3c and 3d with the presence of ras a boron or ha the depletion of pmso and the generation of pmso2 both increase dramatically confirming the generation of fe iv the production of fe iv may be attributed to the heterolysis of peroxide oo bond in pds by fe ii eq 5 furthermore etoh and tba were utilized to selectively scavenge oh and so4 based on the low reactivity of fe iv on etoh k 2 51 103 m 1 s 1 and tba k 60 m 1 s 1 text s4 fig 3e and 3f it can be seen that the addition of 1 0 mm tba has significant inhibitory effect on dep degradation in the ha fe iii pds system according to the fact that dep can t be effective degraded by so4 and fe iv but oh the generation of oh was further testified moreover only a small amount of dep was degraded in the a boron fe iii pds system even without scavengers demonstrating that oh is not the dominant ros with respect to pe degradation when excess tba 100 mm was added in the ha fe iii pds system approximately 40 of pe removal indicates the partial contribution of oh while excess etoh 100 mm can t completely inhibit the oxidation of pe in ha and a boron enhanced fe iii pds systems indicating the presence of other ros besides radicals the significant formation of pmso2 and the great contribution ratio of fe iv ŋ pmso2 on degradation of pmso confirm the non negligible role of fe iv in both ha and a boron enhanced fe iii pds systems fig 4 based on the specific oxygen transfer reaction between fe iv and pmso li zhao qian and pan 2021 wang et al 2018a moreover in the light of the more obvious inhibitory effect on pe degradation of etoh than tba it is reasonable to conclude that so4 is one of the reactive oxidants epr texts fig s4 shows no obvious generation of singlet oxygen 1o2 in a boron and ha enhanced fe iii pds systems based on the above qualitative and semi quantitively analysis oh so4 and fe iv are all generated in both a boron and ha enhanced fe iii pds systems 3 4 the distribution of ros in ras enhanced fe ⅲ pds system based on above results and discussion there is a discrepancy in the distribution of ros in a boron and ha enhanced fe iii pds systems pmso would be oxidized by oh and so4 to form either hydroxylated pmso or biphenyl compounds via a one electron transfer pathway k pmso oh 3 61 109 m 1 s 1 k pmso so4 3 17 108 m 1 s 1 it is significantly different from the formation of fe iv induced product pmso2 via an oxygen atom transfer pathway k pmso fe iv 1 23 105 m 1 s 1 text s9 li et al 2021 pang jiang and ma 2010 pestovsky and bakac 2006 wang et al 2018a therefore we roughly divided ros into radicals oh so4 and non radical fe iv in ras enhanced fe iii pds systems with pmso as the chemical probe fig 4 intriguingly we observe that depletion of pmso generation of pmso2 and the yield of pmso2 ŋ pmso2 the molar ratio of pmso2 production to pmso depletion varies across these ras involved systems the depletion of pmso and the generation of pmso2 in solid ras mediated fe iii pds systems are higher than those in the fe iii pds system with most dissolved ras indicating the stronger enhancement of ros generation by solid materials especially mos2 fig 4a moreover it is observed that the contribution of non radical fe iv expressed by ŋ pmso2 in the ras fe iii pds system approximately follows the order mos2 fe iii pds ws2 fe iii pds ha fe iii pds a boron fe iii pds na2so3 fe iii pds l ce fe iii pds l aa fe iii pds fig 4b in particular the depletion of pmso is mostly attributed to fe iv oxidation in the fe ii pds system which is exactly antithetical to that in l aa fe iii pds system ŋ pmso2 0 in comparison the contribution of non radical fe iv in heterogeneous ras enhanced systems is relatively higher than that in most homogeneous systems based on the above discussion we can choose specific reducing agent to regulate the degradation of organic contaminants via radical and non radical pathways depending on the substrate specific reactivity of ros for instance the mos2 fe iii pds system is more suitable to treat medical wastewater with pharmaceutical ingredients e g smx and cbz due to relatively high rate constants between fe iv and smx k 7 9 0 4 104 m 1 s 1 or cbz k 3 5 0 3 104 m 1 s 1 luo feng zhang sharma and huang 2021 3 5 acceleration of fe iii fe ii conversion the primary mechanism of ras enhanced fenton like reactions is to directly and rapidly promote the reduction from fe iii into fe ii lei et al 2015 li et al 2016 xing et al 2018 zou et al 2013 the variations of total dissolved iron and soluble fe ii were measured to analyze the transformation of iron species as can be seen in fig 5a both a boron and ha rapidly and continuously impel conversion from fe iii to fe ii at a dynamic equilibrium to avoid the precipitation of fe ii the reduction capacity of homogeneous ras is generally stronger than that of heterogeneous ras fig s5 furthermore due to the production of ros via fenton like reaction between fe ii and pds scheme 1 the reduction capacity is associated with the generation of ros in ras enhanced fe iii pds systems fig s5 depicts that the reduction capacity of solid ras approximately follows the order a boron ws2 mos2 intriguingly similar sequence was observed on the proportion of radicals in ros fig 4b moreover the chemical form of dissolved fe ii species is fe2 at ph ranging from 2 0 to 8 0 fig s6 revealing that dissolved fe ii exists in the form of fe2 to induce the generation of ros via fenton like reactions fig 5b depicts that feoh2 is the dominant species of fe iii species to participate in the changeover of fe iii to fe ii at ph 3 0 around 80 moreover feoh2 is the primary reactive iron species to initiate the chain reactions in iron mediated fenton systems zhou et al 2020c which is exactly coincident with experimental phenomenon shown in fig 5c the distribution coefficient of feoh2 δ feoh2 fe iii uncovers that the trend of k obs of pmso removal in these two ras enhanced systems is highly correlated with δ feoh2 fe iii with the variation of solution ph the optimal range of ph is near 3 0 and pmso can be also effectively degraded at initial ph 6 5 20 arising from the decrease of solution ph in both a boron and ha enhanced fe iii pds systems fig s7 s8 3 6 regulating contributions of ros it is well established that experimental parameters can affect the generation of ros and the removal of pollutants for further investigating distribution of ros under the different reaction conditions the effect of solution ph dosage of fe iii and dosage of pds on transformation of pmso in a boron and ha enhanced fe iii pds systems were experimentally analyzed fig s9a and s9d depict that the ph dependent oxidation of pmso where pmso depletion δ pmso increases with ph increasing to 3 0 and declines afterwards with ph further increasing to 6 5 meanwhile pmso2 production δ pmso2 and ŋ pmso2 follow the same trend fig 6 a and 6d in conclusion it is observed that the maximum δ pmso δ pmso2 as well as ŋ pmso2 values were detected at around ph 3 0 manifesting that the most high efficiency of pmso oxidation with the maximum contribution ratio of fe iv moreover it is reasonable to conclude that feoh2 is the dominant species of fe iii species to generate fe iv in addition the effect of dosages of fe iii and pds on pmso transformation in a boron and ha assisted fe iii pds systems at ph 3 0 were also investigated respectively fig 6 and s9 it can be seen that increasing fe iii 0 and pds 0 both causes in a larger δ pmso and δ pmso2 in the first phase and then further increase of dosages of fe iii and pds causes a slight decline of δ pmso and δ pmso2 these results may be due to the loss of reactive oxidants via competitive consumption by iron species and pds respectively text s10 however these results can t be applicable to the ratio of fe iv ŋ pmso2 in ros in a boron and ha enhanced fe iii pds systems which appears to be irregular fig 6 it is hard to obtain the maximum ratio of fe iv ŋ pmso2 by regulating the dosage of fe iii and pds which probably be supported by diversity of fe iii 0 and pds 0 on the processes for producing various ros furthermore the critical effect of ras a boron and ha on the production of ros was examined shown in fig 7 interestingly the variation tendency of the ŋ pmso2 values is both roughly coincident with that of δ pmso2 in the a boron and ha enhanced systems increase of a boron and ha both led to the increase of δ pmso and δ pmso2 at the first stage in the two ras enhanced systems which is attributed to the acceleration of fe iii fe ii cycle when more ras were added however an appreciable decline of δ pmso and δ pmso2 were observed resulting from the competitive consumption of ros by excess ras moreover the reactions of a boron and ha with pds are both extremely slow fig s2 and s3 duan et al 2019 swaroop and gupta 1973 herein ras primarily plays a dual role in ras enhanced fenton like systems including i accelerating fe iii reduction to promote generation of ros and ii rapidly reacting with ros to reduce utilization efficiency of ros table 2 therefore the contributions of fe iv for pmso oxidation in ras fe iii pds systems would decrease with the further increase of ras dosage the dominant ros is thus gradually transformed from non radicals to radicals within the excessive ras on the basis of the above results and discussions the variation of experimental parameters including solution ph and dosages of fe iii pds and ras can not only influence oxidation efficiency of organic contaminants but also change distribution of ros in ras enhanced fe iii pds systems therefore this work provides a reference for changing parameters to regulate the ratio of ros between radicals oh and so4 and non radical fe iv to specifically remediate contaminants 3 7 comparison of homogeneous ras and heterogeneous ras although the mass transfer efficiency of heterogeneous ras is different from homogeneous ras in essence they both promote fenton like reactions by accelerating fe iii reduction in summary the reactions occur in the ras enhanced fenton like systems during the degradation of contaminants generally include i ras induced the reduction of fe iii to promote fenton like oxidation ii ras induced the quenching of ros iii ras induced the consumption of peroxides e g ha mos2 zhou et al 2020a zou et al 2013 iv

fe ii couples to promote fenton like oxidation yaxin 2015 vi the consumption of ros induced by excess fe ii or peroxides text s10 overall homogeneous and heterogeneous ras are all trade off between accelerating fe iii reduction and quenching ros zhou et al 2021 for the homogeneous ras their homogeneity is great helpful for reducing fe iii which is consistent with experimental results shown in fig s5 meanwhile the ros quenching is inevitable due to its reduction capacity table 2 thus excess addition of ras results in significant inhibition of ros for oxidizing organic pollutants fig 7 to our delight some studies reported multiple dosing is an effective strategy to suppress quenching influences dong wei yin and guan 2020b he et al 2020 fig s6 reveals that dissolved fe ii obtained from reduction of fe iii existed in the form of fe2 to participate in the reactions in homogeneous and heterogeneous co catalysis systems both heterogeneous and homogeneous ras can rapidly reduce fe iii fig s5 however the mass transfer from bulk solution onto the surface of solid materials impedes the quenching of ros which facilitates ros induced decontamination of organic contaminants in heterogeneous systems compared with homogeneous ras the relatively weaker quenching effect on ros by heterogeneous ras probably explains the stronger oxidation capacity for pmso in heterogeneous ras enhanced systems fig 4 the contribution of non radical fe iv in heterogeneous ras enhanced fe iii pds systems are higher than those in most homogeneous systems moreover the rate of fe iii reduction would decrease due to the decline of the dosage of ras within the reaction proceeds resulting in continuous decomposition of ras in homogeneous assisted systems nevertheless heterogeneous ras would maintain high reactivity after reaction compared with homogeneous ras assisted systems therefore the production of ros is distinct and affected by solution ph and dosages of reactants in homogeneous and heterogeneous systems the problem of the information of secondary pollution induced by the transformation of ras is also worthy of attention for instance n2o derived from ha the increase of toc induced by organic ras and metal leaching from metallic materials would limit their further industrial application 4 conclusions the introducing of ras strongly boosts generation of ros i e oh so4 and fe iv via reaction between fe ii and pds by directly accelerates the reduction of fe iii scheme 1 as a result the oxidation capability of the fe iii pds system was remarkably improved to degrade a wide variety of contaminants by a boron and ha which exhibits substrate selectivity arising from substrate specific reactivity of ros furthermore the generation efficiency and contributions of ros change with types of ras as well as parameters i e dosages of fe iii pds and ras can be utilized to improve availability of ros and further specifically degraded contaminants in general ros production and the contribution of fe iv in heterogeneous systems is relatively high increasing in the first phase and declining as the ras dosage further increases and the maximal values were both observed at ph 3 0 in ras fe iii pds systems despite the differences in the quenching effects between homogeneous and heterogeneous systems due to ras intrinsic properties they are both trade off between accelerating fe iii reduction and quenching ros nevertheless the loss of ras and the secondary organic metal pollution caused by ras is noteworthy and is need to be minimized or eliminated by further work this work thus not only has some implications for the transformation of ros in ras enhanced fenton like systems and produces assistance in the applicability of ras but also opens up a new avenue

15954,reduction of fe iii is the rate limiting step of iron induced fenton like systems such as the iron peroxydisulfate system reducing agents ras were frequently employed as electron donors to directly reduce fe iii to further promote the formation of reactive oxygen species ros mainly including hydroxyl radical oh sulfate radical so4 and ferryl ion fe iv however the intrinsic distinctions among these ros cause the substrate specific reactivity towards oxidation of diverse organic contaminants in this study various ras representative solid amorphous boron a boron and dissolved hydroxylamine ha were added to enhance the fe iii pds system for investigating the substrate specific reactivity of ros it is demonstrated that ras remarkably boost the fe iii fe ii cycles to produce oh so4 and fe iv in the ras fe iii pds systems based on the results of epr analysis quenching tests and chemical probe analysis furthermore the different yields of methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 indicate that the distribution of multiple oxidizing species changed with various factors i e type and dosage of ras added solution ph fe iii and pds dosage this work provides the possibility for the adjustment of oxidation selectivity of ras fe iii pds systems by regulating contribution of radicals and non radical for oxidizing organic contaminants due to the substrate specific reactivity of oh so4 and fe iv moreover the comparison of homogeneous and heterogeneous ras provides assistance in the application of ras for environmental remediation graphical abstract graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords reductants peroxydisulfate fenton like reaction reactive oxygen species fe iii fe ii cycle 1 introduction recently iron mediated fenton like activation of persulfates peroxymonosulfate pms and peroxydisulfate pds are widely investigated due to their high efficiencies for producing highly reactive oxygen species ros to oxidize a wide variety of organic pollutants eqs 1 2 lee von gunten and kim 2020 xiao et al 2020 ros can be rapidly produced via fenton like reactions between fe ii and persulfates however the sluggish kinetic of fe ii recovery is the inherent drawback and retard the long lasting generation of ros eqs 3 4 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 wu et al 2017 therefore a myriad of literatures devoted to promote regeneration of fe ii in recent years

cysteine l ce molybdenum sulfide mos2 tungsten sulfide ws2 and l ascorbic acid l aa can significantly accelerate fe iii reduction to overcome the rate limitation caused by fe iii accumulation which

hydroxyl radical oh sulfate radical so4 and ferrly ion feivo2 fe iv are claimed as ros in this work and generally produced in fe induced fenton like systems dong et al 2020a wang et al 2018a however the distinct properties redox potential lifetime and reaction mechanism of these ros cause substrate specific reactivity to oxidize diverse organic contaminants lee et al 2020 wang et al 2018a the previous literatures mainly focus on the activation of peroxides and degradation of organic contaminants but the substrate specific reactivity and distribution of ros in ras enhanced fenton like systems remain little noticed lei et al 2015 li et al 2016 xing et al 2018 zou et al 2013 from our point of view taking advantage of the peculiarity of each ros and regulating the distribution of various ros can enhance the degradation of organic pollutants and increase the utilization ratio of ros moreover the input of ras in fenton like systems is virtually a trade off between rapid generation and unwished consumption of ros and prodromic peroxides zhou et al 2021 the ras induced acceleration of fe iii reduction and ros quenching simultaneously occur in the ras enhanced fenton like systems which is related to the intrinsic properties of ras including pka redox potential by products from ras and so on for instance homogeneous ras have strong reductivity inevitable ros quenching but are hard to recycle due to homogeneity therefore it is critical to choose suitable ras in practical application but it is lack of method to evaluate the flexibility of ras in fenton like systems in this study we for the first time systematically discussed the ras enhanced iron pds systems with focusing on substrate specific reactivity of ros towards oxidation of a wide array of organic contaminants regulating the distribution of ros and flexibility of ras overall the introduction of various ras i e amorphous boron a boron ha l aa l ce na2so3 mos2 ws2 significantly improves the oxidation capability of the fe iii pds system and the production of ros various ros were qualitatively and semi quantitatively analyzed by epr analysis quenching tests and chemical probe tests moreover a boron and ha enhanced fe iii pds systems were selected as topical heterogeneous and homogeneous ras to further investigate effect of dosages of fe iii pds and solution ph on distribution of

performed in 100 ml deionized water at a glass beaker under constant stirring with a ptee blade 300 rpm the temperature of batch experiments was controlled at 25 1 0 c with thermostatic water bath each solution with desired dosages of organic pollutants and ferric salt fe iii or fe ii was prepared before reaction and then the initial solution ph was adjusted by sulfuric acid then the desired dosages of pds and ras were simultaneously added to initiate the reactions at specific time intervals approximately 1 0 3 0 ml samples were withdrawn and filtered 0 22 μm membrane to analyze the concentrations of target contaminants quenched by excess sodium thiosulfate and iron species chelated with chromogenic agent 2 3 analysis of reactive oxygen species the generation of reactive radicals e g oh and so4 was qualitatively detected by election paramagnetic resonance epr bruker emx plus technique using dmpo as a trapping agent text s1 the quenching tests were then conducted to qualitatively analyze the contribution of so4 and oh on degradation of contaminants tba and etoh were selected as quenching agents to analyze the contribution of each ros on contaminant degradation moreover it has been reported that tpa can react with oh to produce the characteristic product of htpa via hydroxylation linxiang et al 2004 tpa was thus used as a chemical probe to qualitatively and semi quantitatively identify the production of oh in addition pmso can be oxidized by feivo2 via oxygen transfer to produce a specific product pmso2 which is different from oh and so4 induced oxidation of pmso pestovsky et al 2005 pmso was thus used as the chemical probe to analyze the production of fe iv and the distribution of ros radicals oh and so4 and non radical fe iv by detecting the concentration of pmso2 in the ras enhanced fe iii pds systems 2 4 analytical methods the concentrations of organics pe dep dmp smx bpa nb ba cbz htpa pmso pmso2 were detected by a hplc shimadzu

respectively the ph of the reaction solution was measured by a phs 3c meter rex china the concentrations of iron species total dissolved iron and dissolved fe ii were also measured using a spectrophotometric method with 1 10 phenanthroline as a chromogenic agent text s3 zhou et al 2020b 3 results and discussion 3 1 substrate specific reactivity of ros after the debate of primary ros in the fe ii pds system over the past few years three types of ros oh so4 and fe iv are probably produced based on the results of various qualitative and semi quantitative analysis anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 dong et al 2020a wang et al 2018a each ros oh so4 and fe iv has its own characteristics showing that they react with substrates at different rate constants table 1 and text s4 among these ros oh is a powerful oxidant in conventional aops with high potentials of 2 7 v in acidic condition and 1 8 v in neutral condition buxton greenstock helman and ross 1988 lee et al 2020 moreover oh is widely used for broad spectrum removal of contaminants in waters due to its nonselective reaction at near diffusion controlled rates with organic compounds buxton et al 1988 however its susceptibility to chemical surroundings e g halide ions carbonates and nitrite strongly limits the diffusion range and utilization rate of oh xiao et al 2020 yang pignatello ma and mitch 2014 thus as an appealing alternative to oh based aops so4 based aops has received extensive attention in recent years due to properties of so4 for instance its high redox potential longer life time than oh and loose ph requirement enable it can transfer long distances to oxidize target pollutants buxton et al 1988 oh dong and lim 2016 xiao et al 2020 in addition so4 shows substrate specificity to selectively oxidize organic contaminants which is the main difference of these two radicals lee et al 2020 wojnarovits and takacs 2019 the second order reaction rate constants of so4 for oxidizing some organics are 2 or 3 orders of magnitude smaller than those for oh text s5 as a kind of non radical ros fe iv was recently found in iron pds systems and can oxidize organics which is regarded as the transient reactive intermediate wang et al 2018a it has been demonstrated that the inhibitory effects of background substrates such as inorganic ions e g no2 cl mn2 and hso3 and organic compounds e g aromatic substrates and aliphatic alcohols could be mitigated by the nonradical pathways buxton et al 1988 chen et al 2021 wojnarovits and takacs 2019 compared with oh so4 fe iv reacts with substrates e g pe nb at a rate of several orders of magnitude lower due to its relatively weak redox potentials table s5 bossmann et al 1998 the reactivity of fe iv is more selective towards organic contaminants containing electron rich moieties than so4 and it is influenced by solution ph fe oh 2 2 fe oh 3 h pka 2 0 while so4 is more ph independent bataineh pestovsky and bakac 2012 2016 lee et al 2020 furthermore each reactive oxygen species oh so4 and fe iv carry specific features for oxidizing organic compounds in this regard oh and so4 react with organic compounds via similar pathways i hydrogen abstraction ii electron transfer iii addition elimination and the difference lies in a preferred reaction pathway and the reaction kinetics lee et al 2020 the rate of oxidation by so4 is sensitivity to chemical surroundings such as the degree of alkylation and the type of functional groups and the preferred reaction pathway is influenced by the type and structure of organic compounds this is contrary to the reactivity of oh fe iv can also oxidize organic compounds via multiple pathways such as hydrogen atom and hydride transfer oxygen atom transfer and outer sphere electron transfer as well as electrophilic addition wang et al 2022 the similarities and differences exist between the oxidation behaviors of fe iv and that of oh so4 fe iv initially attacks aromatic rings through electrophilic addition like oh and so4 but subsequent addition elimination process is different wang et al 2022 thereinto the production of sulfone from sulfoxide e g dmso and pmso via oxygen atom transfer is unique to high valent iron species rather than radicals lee et al 2020 wang et al 2018a based on the above discussion radicals oh and so4 exhibit high and poor selective reactivity to oxidize organics however they are short lived and susceptive to nontarget matrix constituents despite fe iv shows lower reactivity its selectivity toward electron rich organics larger diffusion range and longer life time initiate a lot of optimism to degrade target compounds 5 fe ii s 2 o 8 2 h 2 o f e iv o 2 2 so 4 2 2 h 6 so 4 h 2 o h so 4 oh k 8 3 m 1 s 1 7 so 4 o h so 4 2 oh k 6 5 1 0 7 m 1 s

2020a with high rate constants considering that each ros performs specific reactivity towards various substrates dep and pe thus were selected as topical substrates to further investigate the discrepancy between oh so4 and fe iv in one sort of ros dominated systems oh in the uv h2o2 system so4 in the uv pds system wang shao gao lu and an 2018b high valent iron species fe iv fe v and fe vi in the k2feo4 system fig s1 zhu et al 2020 the experimental conditions are shown in text s6 and s7 fig 1 considering the interconversion from so4 to oh etoh and tba were selected as scavengers of oh k etoh oh 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 k tba oh 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 and so4 k etoh so4 1 6 107 m 1 s 1 k tba so4 4 0 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 due to their differentiable reactivities towards these two radicals huang wang yang guo and yu 2017 lai yan li and lai 2018 as can be seen in fig 1a the significant inhibition of tba indicates the dominance of oh in the uv h2o2 system dep and pe were both degraded via the reaction with oh due to its nonselective oxidation property on account of the stronger reactivity towards organic contaminants containing electron rich moieties of so4 the oxidation of dep in the uv pds system might be due to slow so4 reacting with h2o or oh to produce oh eqs 6 7 zhang chen and zhu 2016 which could also explain the similar quenching effect of tba and etoh on dep degradation in the uv pds system fig 1b moreover etoh could significantly inhibit pe degradation and the degradation ratio in the uv pds etoh system is similar to that in the uv system while identical concentration of tba exhibits unobvious inhibitory effect these results confirm the predominance of so4 in the uv pds system high valent iron species exhibits excellent activity to degrade pe but not to dep in the k2feo4 system illustrating the strong substrate selectivity in conclusion it is further demonstrated oh so4 and fe iv cause substrate specific reactivity to oxidize diverse organic contaminants 3 2 substrate specific reactivity of ras enhanced fe iii pds systems considering the differences of homogeneous and heterogeneous ras a boron and ha were added to the fe iii pds system for degradation of a wide variety of organic contaminants including antibiotics smx phenols bpa and pe phthalate esters dmp and dep organic dyes ao7 mo and rhb medicines cbz and aromatics ba and nb fig 2a depicts that the oxidation capacity for contaminants of the fe iii pds system is weak and the removal ratios of most contaminants are below 50 in the fe ii pds system considering the low contribution of ras induced direct activation of pds fig s2 and s3 a boron and ha can strongly enhance the fe iii pds system to oxidize these organic contaminants nevertheless these systems exhibit different degradation efficiency towards various substrates which is related to second order reaction rate constants between each ros and organic compounds fig 2b and text s5 for instance the rate constants between ros oh so4 and fe iv and pe are several orders of magnitude high than those of nb which causes higher degradation ratio of pe than nb in a boron and ha enhanced fe iii pds systems as can be seen in fig 2c the capability of ras is diverse from each other resulting from the different oxidation capability towards dep and pe thereinto the ha fe iii pds system manifests outstanding oxidation capacity to dep and pe while other ras can only boost pe degradation but not dep indicating that the pe degradation in ras except ha enhanced fe iii pds systems may be a nonradical or so4 dominated oxidation process based on the above results the performance of oxidation to organics in various ras enhanced fe iii pds systems are different resulting from the type of ros generated is different despite the similarity in the mechanism how they boost various organics degradation to an extent that each ras carries features that are associated to the production of ros e g reduction capacity thus it indicates that the possibility of utilizing ras discrepancy to produce ros to degrade organics specifically however the ras fe iii pds systems still demonstrated a high oxidation capacity for degradation of a wide array of organic contaminants 3 3 identification of ros for further analyzing the ros in ras fe iii pds system several qualitative and semi quantitative tests were conducted epr tests using dmpo as a spin trapping agent were carried out to identify the reactive radicals in the ras fe iii pds systems as shown in fig 3a there is almost no peak in spectrum from the fe iii pds system demonstrating that fe iii can t activate pds to generate ros along the same lines nothing but the extremely weak quartet line of dmpooh adduct hfsc of α n α h 14 9 g appears in the fe ii pds system nevertheless the stronger signals of dmpooh were observed in a boron and ha enhanced fe iii pds systems confirming that ras significantly accelerates the generation of ros the generation of dmpooh might also be attributed to the existence of fe iv wang et al 2018a and the conversion of dmpo so4 yang banerjee brudvig kim and pignatello 2018 not been limited to the oxidation of oh text s8 therefore a boron and ha enhanced fe iii pds systems probably involve multiple ros tpa is a chemical probe for oh which is utilized to qualitatively and semi quantitatively analyze the generation of oh shao et al 2015 fig 3b depicts that the characteristic product htpa continuously accumulates as the reaction proceeds in both a boron and ha enhanced fe iii pds systems which further demonstrates the ras promoted generation of oh moreover htpa is almost not detected in the fe ii pds system suggesting the low yield of oh pmso can be oxidized to pmso2 by the high valent iron via an oxygen atom transfer which is different from the case of radicals bossmann et al 1998 sharma 2010 as a probe of fe iv 10 53 μm pmso was decomposed within 30 min however pmso2 was not detected in the fe ⅲ pds system fig 3c and 3d with the presence of ras a boron or ha the depletion of pmso and the generation of pmso2 both increase dramatically confirming the generation of fe iv the production of fe iv may be attributed to the heterolysis of peroxide oo bond in pds by fe ii eq 5 furthermore etoh and tba were utilized to selectively scavenge oh and so4 based on the low reactivity of fe iv on etoh k 2 51 103 m 1 s 1 and tba k 60 m 1 s 1 text s4 fig 3e and 3f it can be seen that the addition of 1 0 mm tba has significant inhibitory effect on dep degradation in the ha fe iii pds system according to the fact that dep can t be effective degraded by so4 and fe iv but oh the generation of oh was further testified moreover only a small amount of dep was degraded in the a boron fe iii pds system even without scavengers demonstrating that oh is not the dominant ros with respect to pe degradation when excess tba 100 mm was added in the ha fe iii pds system approximately 40 of pe removal indicates the partial contribution of oh while excess etoh 100 mm can t completely inhibit the oxidation of pe in ha and a boron enhanced fe iii pds systems indicating the presence of other ros besides radicals the significant formation of pmso2 and the great contribution ratio of fe iv ŋ pmso2 on degradation of pmso confirm the non negligible role of fe iv in both ha and a boron enhanced fe iii pds systems fig 4 based on the specific oxygen transfer reaction between fe iv and pmso li zhao qian and pan 2021 wang et al 2018a moreover in the light of the more obvious inhibitory effect on pe degradation of etoh than tba it is reasonable to conclude that so4 is one of the reactive oxidants epr texts fig s4 shows no obvious generation of singlet oxygen 1o2 in a boron and ha enhanced fe iii pds systems based on the above qualitative and semi quantitively analysis oh so4 and fe iv are all generated in both a boron and ha enhanced fe iii pds systems 3 4 the distribution of ros in ras enhanced fe ⅲ pds system based on above results and discussion there is a discrepancy in the distribution of ros in a boron and ha enhanced fe iii pds systems pmso would be oxidized by oh and so4 to form either hydroxylated pmso or biphenyl compounds via a one electron transfer pathway k pmso oh 3 61 109 m 1 s 1 k pmso so4 3 17 108 m 1 s 1 it is significantly different from the formation of fe iv induced product pmso2 via an oxygen atom transfer pathway k pmso fe iv 1 23 105 m 1 s 1 text s9 li et al 2021 pang jiang and ma 2010 pestovsky and bakac 2006 wang et al 2018a therefore we roughly divided ros into radicals oh so4 and non radical fe iv in ras enhanced fe iii pds systems with pmso as the chemical probe fig 4 intriguingly we observe that depletion of pmso generation of pmso2 and the yield of pmso2 ŋ pmso2 the molar ratio of pmso2 production to pmso depletion varies across these ras involved systems the depletion of pmso and the generation of pmso2 in solid ras mediated fe iii pds systems are higher than those in the fe iii pds system with most dissolved ras indicating the stronger enhancement of ros generation by solid materials especially mos2 fig 4a moreover it is observed that the contribution of non radical fe iv expressed by ŋ pmso2 in the ras fe iii pds system approximately follows the order mos2 fe iii pds ws2 fe iii pds ha fe iii pds a boron fe iii pds na2so3 fe iii pds l ce fe iii pds l aa fe iii pds fig 4b in particular the depletion of pmso is mostly attributed to fe iv oxidation in the fe ii pds system which is exactly antithetical to that in l aa fe iii pds system ŋ pmso2 0 in comparison the contribution of non radical fe iv in heterogeneous ras enhanced systems is relatively higher than that in most homogeneous systems based on the above discussion we can choose specific reducing agent to regulate the degradation of organic contaminants via radical and non radical pathways depending on the substrate specific reactivity of ros for instance the mos2 fe iii pds system is more suitable to treat medical wastewater with pharmaceutical ingredients e g smx and cbz due to relatively high rate constants between fe iv and smx k 7 9 0 4 104 m 1 s 1 or cbz k 3 5 0 3 104 m 1 s 1 luo feng zhang sharma and huang 2021 3 5 acceleration of fe iii fe ii conversion the primary mechanism of ras enhanced fenton like reactions is to directly and rapidly promote the reduction from fe iii into fe ii lei et al 2015 li et al 2016 xing et al 2018 zou et al 2013 the variations of total dissolved iron and soluble fe ii were measured to analyze the transformation of iron species as can be seen in fig 5a both a boron and ha rapidly and continuously impel conversion from fe iii to fe ii at a dynamic equilibrium to avoid the precipitation of fe ii the reduction capacity of homogeneous ras is generally stronger than that of heterogeneous ras fig s5 furthermore due to the production of ros via fenton like reaction between fe ii and pds scheme 1 the reduction capacity is associated with the generation of ros in ras enhanced fe iii pds systems fig s5 depicts that the reduction capacity of solid ras approximately follows the order a boron ws2 mos2 intriguingly similar sequence was observed on the proportion of radicals in ros fig 4b moreover the chemical form of dissolved fe ii species is fe2 at ph ranging from 2 0 to 8 0 fig s6 revealing that dissolved fe ii exists in the form of fe2 to induce the generation of ros via fenton like reactions fig 5b depicts that feoh2 is the dominant species of fe iii species to participate in the changeover of fe iii to fe ii at ph 3 0 around 80 moreover feoh2 is the primary reactive iron species to initiate the chain reactions in iron mediated fenton systems zhou et al 2020c which is exactly coincident with experimental phenomenon shown in fig 5c the distribution coefficient of feoh2 δ feoh2 fe iii uncovers that the trend of k obs of pmso removal in these two ras enhanced systems is highly correlated with δ feoh2 fe iii with the variation of solution ph the optimal range of ph is near 3 0 and pmso can be also effectively degraded at initial ph 6 5 20 arising from the decrease of solution ph in both a boron and ha enhanced fe iii pds systems fig s7 s8 3 6 regulating contributions of ros it is well established that experimental parameters can affect the generation of ros and the removal of pollutants for further investigating distribution of ros under the different reaction conditions the effect of solution ph dosage of fe iii and dosage of pds on transformation of pmso in a boron and ha enhanced fe iii pds systems were experimentally analyzed fig s9a and s9d depict that the ph dependent oxidation of pmso where pmso depletion δ pmso increases with ph increasing to 3 0 and declines afterwards with ph further increasing to 6 5 meanwhile pmso2 production δ pmso2 and ŋ pmso2 follow the same trend fig 6 a and 6d in conclusion it is observed that the maximum δ pmso δ pmso2 as well as ŋ pmso2 values were detected at around ph 3 0 manifesting that the most high efficiency of pmso oxidation with the maximum contribution ratio of fe iv moreover it is reasonable to conclude that feoh2 is the dominant species of fe iii species to generate fe iv in addition the effect of dosages of fe iii and pds on pmso transformation in a boron and ha assisted fe iii pds systems at ph 3 0 were also investigated respectively fig 6 and s9 it can be seen that increasing fe iii 0 and pds 0 both causes in a larger δ pmso and δ pmso2 in the first phase and then further increase of dosages of fe iii and pds causes a slight decline of δ pmso and δ pmso2 these results may be due to the loss of reactive oxidants via competitive consumption by iron species and pds respectively text s10 however these results can t be applicable to the ratio of fe iv ŋ pmso2 in ros in a boron and ha enhanced fe iii pds systems which appears to be irregular fig 6 it is hard to obtain the maximum ratio of fe iv ŋ pmso2 by regulating the dosage of fe iii and pds which probably be supported by diversity of fe iii 0 and pds 0 on the processes for producing various ros furthermore the critical effect of ras a boron and ha on the production of ros was examined shown in fig 7 interestingly the variation tendency of the ŋ pmso2 values is both roughly coincident with that of δ pmso2 in the a boron and ha enhanced systems increase of a boron and ha both led to the increase of δ pmso and δ pmso2 at the first stage in the two ras enhanced systems which is attributed to the acceleration of fe iii fe ii cycle when more ras were added however an appreciable decline of δ pmso and δ pmso2 were observed resulting from the competitive consumption of ros by excess ras moreover the reactions of a boron and ha with pds are both extremely slow fig s2 and s3 duan et al 2019 swaroop and gupta 1973 herein ras primarily plays a dual role in ras enhanced fenton like systems including i accelerating fe iii reduction to promote generation of ros and ii rapidly reacting with ros to reduce utilization efficiency of ros table 2 therefore the contributions of fe iv for pmso oxidation in ras fe iii pds systems would decrease with the further increase of ras dosage the dominant ros is thus gradually transformed from non radicals to radicals within the excessive ras on the basis of the above results and discussions the variation of experimental parameters including solution ph and dosages of fe iii pds and ras can not only influence oxidation efficiency of organic contaminants but also change distribution of ros in ras enhanced fe iii pds systems therefore this work provides a reference for changing parameters to regulate the ratio of ros between radicals oh and so4 and non radical fe iv to specifically remediate contaminants 3 7 comparison of homogeneous ras and heterogeneous ras although the mass transfer efficiency of heterogeneous ras is different from homogeneous ras in essence they both promote fenton like reactions by accelerating fe iii reduction in summary the reactions occur in the ras enhanced fenton like systems during the degradation of contaminants generally include i ras induced the reduction of fe iii to promote fenton like oxidation ii ras induced the quenching of ros iii ras induced the consumption of peroxides e g ha mos2 zhou et al 2020a zou et al 2013 iv

fe ii couples to promote fenton like oxidation yaxin 2015 vi the consumption of ros induced by excess fe ii or peroxides text s10 overall homogeneous and heterogeneous ras are all trade off between accelerating fe iii reduction and quenching ros zhou et al 2021 for the homogeneous ras their homogeneity is great helpful for reducing fe iii which is consistent with experimental results shown in fig s5 meanwhile the ros quenching is inevitable due to its reduction capacity table 2 thus excess addition of ras results in significant inhibition of ros for oxidizing organic pollutants fig 7 to our delight some studies reported multiple dosing is an effective strategy to suppress quenching influences dong wei yin and guan 2020b he et al 2020 fig s6 reveals that dissolved fe ii obtained from reduction of fe iii existed in the form of fe2 to participate in the reactions in homogeneous and heterogeneous co catalysis systems both heterogeneous and homogeneous ras can rapidly reduce fe iii fig s5 however the mass transfer from bulk solution onto the surface of solid materials impedes the quenching of ros which facilitates ros induced decontamination of organic contaminants in heterogeneous systems compared with homogeneous ras the relatively weaker quenching effect on ros by heterogeneous ras probably explains the stronger oxidation capacity for pmso in heterogeneous ras enhanced systems fig 4 the contribution of non radical fe iv in heterogeneous ras enhanced fe iii pds systems are higher than those in most homogeneous systems moreover the rate of fe iii reduction would decrease due to the decline of the dosage of ras within the reaction proceeds resulting in continuous decomposition of ras in homogeneous assisted systems nevertheless heterogeneous ras would maintain high reactivity after reaction compared with homogeneous ras assisted systems therefore the production of ros is distinct and affected by solution ph and dosages of reactants in homogeneous and heterogeneous systems the problem of the information of secondary pollution induced by the transformation of ras is also worthy of attention for instance n2o derived from ha the increase of toc induced by organic ras and metal leaching from metallic materials would limit their further industrial application 4 conclusions the introducing of ras strongly boosts generation of ros i e oh so4 and fe iv via reaction between fe ii and pds by directly accelerates the reduction of fe iii scheme 1 as a result the oxidation capability of the fe iii pds system was remarkably improved to degrade a wide variety of contaminants by a boron and ha which exhibits substrate selectivity arising from substrate specific reactivity of ros furthermore the generation efficiency and contributions of ros change with types of ras as well as parameters i e dosages of fe iii pds and ras can be utilized to improve availability of ros and further specifically degraded contaminants in general ros production and the contribution of fe iv in heterogeneous systems is relatively high increasing in the first phase and declining as the ras dosage further increases and the maximal values were both observed at ph 3 0 in ras fe iii pds systems despite the differences in the quenching effects between homogeneous and heterogeneous systems due to ras intrinsic properties they are both trade off between accelerating fe iii reduction and quenching ros nevertheless the loss of ras and the secondary organic metal pollution caused by ras is noteworthy and is need to be minimized or eliminated by further work this work thus not only has some implications for the transformation of ros in ras enhanced fenton like systems and produces assistance in the applicability of ras but also opens up a new avenue
