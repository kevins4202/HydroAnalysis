20315,predicting the distribution of flow velocity inside a semi submersible aquaculture platform and taking measures to optimize the flow field are critical to provide a dependable inhabit for farmed fish this paper examines the hydrodynamics of a semi submersible fish farm under current using the porous media method combined with a rigid wall based on the shear stress transport k omega turbulence model the results show that the presence of nets expands the low flow area and provides a better inhibit for farmed fish in the severe currents the increase of net solidity enhances the damping effect on the flow and it also simultaneously increases the current loads acting on the net the attenuation caused by different net solidities produces a 66 10 deficit of the flow velocity in maximum inside aquaculture platform a maximum increase of 36 82 for the drag force acting on the aquaculture platform is obtained furthermore the distribution of drag force acting on the aquaculture platform in current is also assessed although the drag force of the frame only is approximately twice compared to the net only case the improvement in the strength of the net structure under the action of flow should not be ignored keywords aquaculture platform hydrodynamic flow field drag force porous media 1 introduction aquaculture farming has increased exponentially to meet the world s growing seafood demand in recent years farmed fish as important marine protein production has been widely cultivated around the world bostock et al 2010 to guarantee a natural water environment promote water exchange and improve the survival rate of farmed fish there has been a tendency that shifts towards offshore aquaculture farming due to constrained near shore space and increased environmental pollution however offshore harsh conditions may negatively impact fish growth resulting in low growth rates and higher infection cases harper and wolf 2009 meanwhile the harsh oceanic conditions place heavy design constraints on the structures accordingly aquaculture farming systems must be developed to withstand these conditions in the open ocean to provide a dependable inhabit for the farmed fish as a representative of offshore aquaculture structures the semi submersible rigid cage has been considered a step forward to the new aquaculture era chu et al 2020 these novel structures maintain sufficient volumes and keep farmed fish in place thanks to the rigid frame it seems that engineers show growing interest in favor of rigid aquaculture structures given their potential advantages of durability to the ever changing oceanic conditions in the open ocean the strong current is an unavoidable environmental load for the aquaculture platform although the high flow velocity facilitates the water exchange ensures an adequate supply of dissolved oxygen and significantly reduces the pollution inside the aquaculture platform johansson et al 2007 the high flow velocity also increases the possible death risk of fish and causes damage to the aquaculture platform simultaneously the low flow velocity inside the aquaculture platform reduces the physical friction between the farmed fish and the aquaculture cage but it also leads to insufficient dissolved oxygen and the fish feces could not be diffused timely as a result the probability of fish death is greatly increased hence understanding the fluid net structure interactions xu and qin 2020 predicting the flow velocity distributions inside the aquaculture cages and the current load acting on the aquaculture cages and further taking optimized measures to significantly improve the living environment of the farmed fish are vitally important to avoid economic losses hydrodynamic performance and dynamic response of traditional fish cages have been widely studied through experimental and numerical approaches tsukrov et al 2003 kristiansen et al 2012 2015 zhao et al 2013 xu et al 2013 li et al 2013a 2013b huang et al 2018 gansel et al 2018 however most of them concerned with mooring line force deformation and motions of the fish cage but did not consider the distribution of the flow velocity inside the fish cage among the plenty of factors that need attention the flow field is the essential parameter for the survival of farmed fish efficient water flow exchange can ensure sufficient dissolved oxygen and avoid water pollution in the early stages the single plane net was used as the research object and the water flow field behind and the drag force on the plane net were analyzed based on cfd the low velocity region behind the plane net helps farmed fish avoid casualties under strong currents patursson et al 2006 2010 zhao et al 2013a as the computational efficiency improves the numerical analysis of the flow field inside the entire fish cage such as gravity cages and spherical cages becomes possible the damping effect of single fish cage and multiple cages zhao et al 2013b cornejo et al 2014 tang et al 2017 rickard 2020 bui et al 2020 dong et al 2020 2021 in certain arrangement on the flow was investigated the results showed that the increase in the number of fish cages could aggravate the attenuation of the internal flow velocity of the aquaculture cages and the spacing between the fish cages has a certain impact on the distribution of the flow velocity inside fish cages in addition the net solidity in aquaculture cages is also a contributing factor regarding the flow distribution the impact of net solidity bi et al 2013 2015 2018 tu et al 2020 on the water flow exchange and the attenuation of the flow velocity in the aquaculture systems has been studied though experimental tests computational fluid dynamics model and multi relaxation time mrt lattice boltzmann model although the increase of the net solidity prevents the farmed fish from escaping in the meantime it hinders the exchange of water flow and increases the consumption of dissolved oxygen inside the fish cage causing a great death risk of farmed fish to provide a suitable living environment for farmed fish a novel semi submersible aquaculture platform that consists of flexible nets and rigid frames is proposed to study the flow fields inside and around the structure this semi submersible aquaculture platform has distinct features that are notably different from a traditional fish cage e g the flexible net cage as for the traditional methods the porous media theory only is applied to model the fish net based on the realizable k ε turbulence model and the rigid frame such as rigid aquaculture structure cannot be included zhao et al 2013a b in the present study the semi submersible aquaculture platform consists of fish nets and rigid frames modeled by porous media and rigid wall boundary the presences of fish nets flow velocities and the net solidity are three critical factors that can impact the flow field and current loads the existence of the fish nets makes the distribution of flow velocity and the living environment of fish more complicated the increase of net solidity contributes to the fish net s damping effect and increases the drag force acting on it therefore the present study analyzes the influences of these three factors on the flow field and drag force for the semi submersible aquaculture platforms this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the description of the numerical method to a semi submersible aquaculture platform section 3 describes the physical model test and verifications of the numerical results section 4 provides the numerical results and a thorough discussion regarding the hydrodynamic characteristics of the flow over the aquaculture platform these characteristics are based on three factors namely the presence of nets the flow velocities and the net solidities furthermore the distribution of drag force acting on the aquaculture platform in current is also discussed this is followed by the conclusions of this paper in section 5 2 numerical descriptions 2 1 numerical setup we use the porous media method and rigid wall to predict the flow velocity distribution inside and around a semi submersible aquaculture platform model this model comprises two parts the rigid frame and the net system as depicted in fig 1 the diameter of the aquaculture platform is 1 0 m with a scale of 1 120 the specific structural parameters are illustrated in table 1 and other parameters are presented in our previous study of zhao et al 2019 the sketch of the numerical model setup in a water flume is represented in fig 2 the numerical flume has a dimension of 10 m long 2 m width 1 m depth the distance between the inlet boundary and the center of the aquaculture platform model is 3 m while the one between the outlet boundary and the center of aquaculture platform model is 7 m to ensure that the wake is fully developed the center of the aquaculture platform is 1 m away from the flume wall region 1 2 and 3 are defined as the upstream region aquaculture platform region and downstream region respectively 2 2 governing equations and turbulence model we consider a three dimensional aquaculture

grids and orthogonal hexahedral grids are applied to the fluid region and the porous media region as shown in fig 3 fluid domains such as zone 1 and zone 3 are meshed with orthogonal hexahedral grids and the mesh size is 0 1 m zone 2 including fluid and porous media is meshed by tetrahedral grids zhao et al 2013b reported that the thickness of the porous media did not immensely affect the simulation results therefore a thickness of 5 mm is chosen for the porous media and the smallest size of the grid is set to 0 0025 m for zone 2 and the grid independence study will be addressed in section 3 of this paper three layers grid is adopted near the wall boundary of the flume two layers grid is taken along the direction of thickness for porous media including bottom net and side net and the grid size is 0 0025 m the exact number of grids including total grid fluid grid side net grid and bottom net grid are listed in table 2 a growth rate of 1 2 is set to facilitate the grid smooth connection between the fluid domain and the porous media for zone 2 and the wall the grids near the pontoons columns and braces are refined to ensure that the flow characteristics can be captured we use courant friedrichs lewy cfl number to define the convergence condition of the numerical results the courant number can be calculated by c o u m a x δ t δ x m i n where the δ x m i n is the minimum grid size and u m a x is the maximum flow velocity in the present study with a time step of 0 005 s the minimum grid size δ x m i n 0 0025 m and the maximum flow velocity u m a x 0 2687 m s we yield a cfl number to be less than 1 to meet the convergence condition 2 4 boundary conditions and discretization the origin of the coordinate is defined at the center of the semi submersible aquaculture platform see fig 2 the x axis is along the direction of the water flow and it follows the right hand spiral rule the left boundary of the numerical flume is defined as velocity inlet the right boundary is described by the outflow boundary the water free surface is modeled by wall boundary condition with zero shear force the sides the bottom of the flume and the main frame are defined by stationary wall boundary conditions with no slip to solve the governing equations discretized using the finite volume method the simplec algorithm doormaal and raithby 1984 based on a 3d pressure based solver is applied using cfd software fluent 18 2 from ansys inc the discretization scheme for pressure momentum turbulent kinetic energy and specific dissipation rate is carried out using a second order upwind scheme the simulations are defined as having reached a converged solution when all residuals reduce to less than 0 001 the simplepc algorithm is organized as follows step 1 give an

found in step 4 as the new p return to step 2 cycle through this loop until convergence is achieved 3 verifications for numerical model 3 1 grid independence for the semi submersible aquaculture platform the grid resolution is critical to the convergence of calculations the grids corresponding to different courant numbers deserve further study to ensure the accuracy of the numerical calculations three grid sizes including 0 0025 m 0 0016 m and 0 0013 m are selected to obtain three corresponding courant numbers these are 0 4408 0 6887 and 0 8477 and the incoming flow velocity is 0 2204 m s the current flow distributions over the semi submersible aquaculture platform under these three different courant numbers are shown in fig 4 owing to the extended distance from the aquaculture platform the flow velocity along the direction of incoming flow remains stable and it is not affected by the courant numbers in region 1 see fig 4 however in region 2 due to the existence of the aquaculture platform the flow velocity fluctuates and does not show a steady state furthermore the flow velocity has a reduction after passing through the aquaculture platform compared with region 1 and region 2 the damping effect of the aquaculture platform on the flow is more evident in region 3 and the average relative error reaches 1 41 within a reasonable range through the above analysis the results show that grid size barely affects the simulated results therefore to guarantee accuracy and improve computational efficiency a grid size of 0 0025 m is applied in the rest of the analysis the grid resolution is chosen such that the required accuracy is satisfied but the computational costs are tolerably acceptable 3 2 verification for the plane nets normal to the flow the flow velocity distribution of single plane nets has been measured by zhao et al 2013a the plane nets are normal to the direction of the incoming flow the water depth is 0 7 m in the test and the plane nets have a dimension of 0 4 m height 1 0 m width as shown in fig 5 in the experiment the steady flow is generated by the pump at the end of the flume the acoustic doppler velometer adv is applied to measure the current velocity and the load cell is applied to measure the drag force acting on the fish net to collect accurate data the time series of flow velocity at each measurement point is recorded stable data throughout 10 s is chosen for data analysis and the flow velocity and the drag force are the average value of the corresponding time series in the numerical model the plane net is modeled using the porous media with a thickness of 50 mm the normal viscous resistance coefficient d n and the normal inertial resistance coefficient c n are directly assigned as 75990 m 2 and 8 087 m 1 referred by zhao et al 2013a four flow velocities 0 1590 m s 0 3072 m s 0 4330 m s and 0 5579 m s are chosen as incoming flow velocity the flow velocity distribution and drag force are verified by comparing experimental results and calculated values the flow velocities at the measuring points are presented in fig 5 the relative error is calculated between the experimental and numerical values via r e r r u n u m u e x p u e x p where r e r r is the relative error u n u m is the flow velocity of numerical simulation and u e x p is the measured flow velocity in the test overall the average relative error reaches 3 38 for the flow velocity and 6 10 for the drag force it is indicated from fig 6 and fig 7 that the flow velocity and the drag force from numerical simulation matches well with the experimental values besides the flow velocity has an obvious reduction when the flow passes through the plane nets which can be observed from the flow velocity at positions b and c therefore the shielding effect of fish nets on the flow velocity should be considered and cannot be ignored 3 3 test verification for the semi submersible aquaculture platform a semi submersible aquaculture platform model is studied numerically and compared with experimental tests the physical model test is conducted using a wave current flume at the state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering dalian university of technology dalian china in the experimental test the water depth and draught are respectively 1 0 m and 0 36 m the thickness of porous media is 5 mm which can avoid the effects of the thin columns contained in the porous media on the flow field the considered incoming flow velocities used in the experimental tests are 0 1519 m s and 0 2204 m s respectively the acoustic doppler velometer and the load cell are respectively applied to measure the flow velocity inside and around the semi submersible aquaculture platform model and the drag force acting on the semi submersible aquaculture platform model in addition the flow velocity changes along the incoming flow direction are analyzed the measuring points are arranged in the flume and are placed 19 cm below the water surface as shown in fig 8 the comparison of flow velocity between the experimental and numerical values is presented in fig 9 and fig 10 the average relative error reaches 5 30 for the flow velocity and 2 61 for the drag force this indicates that the numerical results agree well with the experimental values and the relative error is within a reasonable range therefore the numerical method can be applied to predict the flow velocity distribution inside and around the aquaculture platform for different incoming flow velocities as shown in fig 9 the flow velocity has a noticeable reduction along the direction of incoming flow inside and downstream of the aquaculture platform 4 results and discussion it is challenging to obtain the in situ data of the flow field inside and around the aquaculture platform in the open ocean thus in the present study a numerical simulation approach is employed to estimate the flow velocity distribution furthermore the drag force acting on the aquaculture platform a concerning problem for engineers is also estimated 4 1 hydrodynamic characteristics based on the presence of nets net systems are of significance to the aquaculture platform which prevents fish from escaping and provides a stable environment with low flow velocity for farmed fish owning to the existence of net systems the flow velocity distribution inside and around the aquaculture platform becomes complicated to characterize the flow near the aquaculture platform based on the presences of net systems three cases namely the frame only case no fish nets the frame with side nets no bottom nets and the aquaculture platform with side and bottom nets are selected as shown in fig 11 when the flow velocity is 0 2204 m s the magnitude of flow velocity is analyzed along the centerline of the aquaculture platform which is located 0 11 m below the water surface as shown in fig 12 the flow velocity inside the aquaculture platform exhibits slight reduction and fluctuation and the flow velocity downstream of the aquaculture platform first has a reduction near the frame and then remains stable it can be observed from fig 12 that the flow velocity inside the frame is higher than that of the frame with side nets and the aquaculture platform however the flow velocity inside the aquaculture platform is slightly less than that of the frame with side nets and the flow velocity is reversed downstream of the aquaculture platform correspondingly the presence of the fish net further increases the drag force acting on the aquaculture facility and the drag force acting on the fish net is 55 57 of that on the rigid frame as shown in fig 13 the drag force acting on the fish net is relatively small compared to the drag force on the frame and the difference of drag force between the frame with side nets and aquaculture platform is relatively small overall the difference in flow velocity and drag force between the frame with side nets and the aquaculture platform is not apparent further analysis shows that the flow velocity is attenuated by 16 15 28 18 28 81 inside the frame frame with side nets and the aquaculture platform respectively at x 0 25d when the distance from the center of the aquaculture platform is 6d the flow velocity has reductions of 12 30 31 44 and 28 58 regarding the frame frame with side nets and the aquaculture platform therefore it can be concluded that the influence of bottom fish nets on the flow velocity is insignificant and the side fish nets have a great influence on the attenuation of the flow velocity the aquaculture platform is a complex three dimensional structure it makes the flow velocity attenuate to a certain extent and also makes the flow velocity appear a three dimensional spatial distribution as shown in fig 14 the results indicate that the effect of net systems on the flow field cannot be ignored and their existence changes the magnitude and spatial distribution of flow velocity from fig 14 we see that the domain of higher flow velocity inside and downstream of the frame is higher than that of the frame with side nets and the aquaculture platform furthermore by comparing the distribution of flow velocity inside the frame with side nets and the aquaculture platform the existence of the bottom nets has less influence on the distribution of flow velocity in aquaculture engineering high velocity areas inside an aquaculture platform can lead to the destruction of the structure and can damage the living environment of farmed fish when flow velocity is 0 2204 m s the flow velocity distribution inside the frame only case the frame with side nets case and the aquaculture platform case at the x y section of z 0 15 m and z 0 25 m are exhibited in fig 15 since the aquaculture platform is a complex three dimensional structure the flow field presents different distributions at different x y sections by comparing the contours of flow velocity it can be observed that the low velocity area on the cross section of z 0 15 m is higher than the low velocity area on x 0 25 m this is because the flow velocity distribution at the x y section of z 0 15 m is affected by the side nets and the bottom nets bottom braces and pontoons resulting in greater flow attenuation than the flow velocity distribution at x y section of z 0 25 m in addition comparing the flow velocity distribution inside the frame frame with side nets and aquaculture platform high velocity areas inside the frame are more than that inside frame with side nets and aquaculture platform however there is no significant difference in the low flow velocity area at z 0 25 m for the frame with side nets and aquaculture platforms owing to the effect of bottom nets the low velocity area inside the frame with side nets is smaller than inside the aquaculture platform at the x y section of z 0 15 m 4 2 hydrodynamic characteristics based on flow velocities by characterizing the internal and external flow fields of the aquaculture platform at different incoming flow velocities flow velocity distribution at different locations can be obtained these analyses provide guidance for practical aquaculture engineering four incoming flow velocities namely 0 1033 m s 0 1519 m s 0 2204 m s and 0 2687 m s are selected and applied in the present study as exhibited in fig 16 the flow velocity is analyzed along the centerline of the aquaculture platform which is 0 11 m below the water surface the drag force can be described in fig 17 for different incoming flow velocities it can be observed from fig 16 that the flow velocity has a reduction along the direction of the incoming flow in region 1 the flow velocity remains stable and then drops sharply to zero near the column in region 2 compared to the incoming flow velocity the flow velocity falls and fluctuates this is because 1 the flow velocity is attenuated owing to the damping effect of the columns and net systems and 2 the interaction between multiple piles leads to the instability of the flow velocity after the current passes through the aquaculture platform the flow velocity rises but is not as equal as the incoming flow velocity in region 3 the flow velocity fluctuates near the columns and then becomes stable compared to the incoming flow velocity the downstream flow velocity of the aquaculture platform slightly decreases when the incoming flow velocity is 0 2204 m s the percentage of flow velocity reduction r p u 0 u u 0 can be calculated along the incoming flow here u 0 is the incoming flow velocity and u is the flow velocity along the incoming flow direction the flow velocity decreases 28 81 at x 0 25d inside the aquaculture platform d 1 0 m represents the diameter of the aquaculture platform when the distances become 1d and 6d downstream of the aquaculture platform the flow velocity reductions are 38 57 and 28 58 respectively as the distance from the aquaculture platform increases the shielding effect of the aquaculture platform on the flow velocity gradually decreases in addition the drag force acting on the aquaculture platform has a notable increase as the incoming flow velocity increases the increase of incoming flow velocity significantly affects the drag force as shown in fig 17 fig 18 depicts the flow velocity distribution along the direction perpendicular to the incoming flow the flow velocity is zero at y 1 0 m where the flume wall is located the flow velocity increases rapidly and then becomes stable between y 1 0 m and 0 5 m however the flow velocity increases near the columns at y 0 5 m and 0 0 m from the energy perspective pressure energy is converted into kinetic energy when the flow passes over the columns and pontoons for flow around a cylinder the flow velocity should be increased twice the incoming flow velocity however part of the energy will be lost due to the presence of fluid viscosity the flow velocity has a reduction and it presents fluctuation within a certain range between x 0 5 m and x 0 5 m under the influence of the semi submersible aquaculture platform this indicates that the aquaculture platform is a complex structure and that the change of the flow velocity inside the aquaculture platform is not only the effect of one pile but the result of the mutual influence of multiple piles and net systems fig 19 exhibits the flow velocity distribution along the direction of water depth at x 0 25 m the flow velocity maintains a stable value between the bottom of the flume z 0 64 m and the aquaculture platform z 0 m and it attains zero at the wall of the flume and columns at different incoming flow velocities also the flow velocity distribution fluctuates inside the aquaculture platform along with the water depth moreover the magnitude of flow velocity inside the aquaculture platform is significantly less than that outside the aquaculture platform the complexity of the aquaculture platform leads to the instability of the internal flow velocity distribution along with water depth 4 3 hydrodynamic characteristics based on net solidities net solidity is an important indicator to measure the water permeability of fish nets the increase of net solidity can improve the strength of fish nets and reduce the risk of fish escape in practical aquaculture a suitable flow velocity in the range of 0 1 m s to 0 6 m s can provide a safe and comfortable living environment for farmed fish inside the aquaculture platform chu et al 2020 however the excessive net solidity reduces the water permeability of the fish net diminishes the exchange of flow increases the drag force and is not conducive to fish health in addition the increase in the solidity of the net may also be caused by the accumulation of biofouling communities in the seawater which could lead to negative effects on the hydrodynamic behaviors of fish cages bi et al 2015 el thalji 2019 for instance 1 the hydrodynamic forces acting on the fish cage are dramatically increased which increases the risk of its structural failure and fatigue damage 2 biofouling hinders the water exchange capacity leading to insufficient oxygen supply 3 the accumulation of biological attachments can increase the risk of fish diseases therefore the study of hydrodynamic characteristics based on net solidities is of significance for practical aquaculture engineering in the present study four fish nets solidities including 0 15 0 25 0 35 and 0 45 are considered to characterize the flow field of the aquaculture platform and drag force acting on the aquaculture platform the x y section of z 0 25 m is selected and analyzed for the flow velocity and the incoming flow velocity is 0 1519 m s it can be observed from fig 20 and fig 21 that the net solidity has a noticeable influence on the magnitude and distribution of flow velocity as the solidity of the netting increases the flow velocity has a pronounced reduction inside and downstream aquaculture platform the increase of net solidity leads to the increase of flow velocity between the flume and aquaculture platform and there is a small region of flow velocity reduction upstream of the aquaculture platform this could be because the water permeability of the fish nets gradually decreases with the increase of net solidity and the change of the flow direction gets more noticeable around the plane net with increasing solidity on the netting bi et al 2015 for the flow around a cylinder kinetic energy is converted into pressure energy upstream of the aquaculture platform and the flow velocity is reduced on both sides of the aquaculture platform the conversion of pressure energy into kinetic energy causes the flow velocity to increase furthermore this phenomenon becomes more evident as the solidity increases to quantitatively analyze the damping of aquaculture platform with different net solidities the magnitude of flow velocity along the direction of incoming flow velocity are studied as shown in fig 22 it can be observed that there is a noticeable reduction of flow velocity inside and downstream aquaculture platforms for different net solidity as the net solidity increases the damping of the net systems on the flow also increases in region 2 the minimum flow velocity at x 0 25d can reach 0 052 m s for the solidity of 0 45 and the flow velocity is reduced by 66 10 for the solidity of 0 15 the flow velocity attenuation percentage is 29 36 smaller than that of the solidity of 0 45 in region 3 the flow velocity gradually increases as the distance from the aquaculture platform increases the influence of aquaculture platforms on the flow field decreases the flow velocity decreases by 39 10 53 98 65 24 and 72 42 at x 1d for the solidity of 0 15 0 25 0 35 and 0 45 respectively when the distance from the center of the aquaculture platform is 6d the flow velocity decreases by 28 49 40 42 48 78 and 52 80 for the solidity of 0 15 0 25 0 35 and 0 45 respectively although the increase in net solidity will further aggravate the attenuation of the flow velocity there is an increase in the drag force acting on the aquaculture platform due to the increase of solidity as shown in fig 23 after comparing the net solidity of 0 15 and 0 45 it is found that when the net solidity is tripled the drag force acting on the aquaculture platform increases by 36 82 however the increasing rate of drag force gradually decreases as the solidity increases from the flow velocity reduction we see that the damping effect of the semi submersible aquaculture platform on the flow is different from the traditional fish cage and the rigid frame causes the complexity of the flow field the reduction factor calculated in this study is compared with løland 1991 and bi et al 2015 as shown in fig 24 løland 1991 derived the formula of flow velocity reduction by combining theory and experiment for fish cages as follows u u 0 i 1 n c r i 18 where r i is the flow velocity reduction factor and r i 1 0 0 46 c d n c is the number of upstream crossings of other plane nets before the current approaches the actual plane net bi et al 2015 proposed a formula between the flow velocity reduction factor and the drag coefficient c d inside the fish cage and downstream of the fish cage the best fitting correlation can be described as follows r i n 0 0623 c d 2 0 3178 c d 1 19 r d s 0 0386 c d 2 0 6765 c d 1 20 where r i n is the minimum flow velocity reduction factor inside the fish cage r d s is the minimum flow velocity reduction factor downstream of a fish cage the drag coefficient of the net c d is calculated using the empirical formula proposed by løland 1993 c d 0 04 0 04 0 33 s n 6 54 s n 2 4 88 s n 3 c o s α 21 where α 90 α α is the attack angle s n is the net solidity løland 1991 and bi et al 2015 studied traditional fish cages which do not have rigid components such as pontoons columns and braces thus the reduction of flow velocity inside and downstream of traditional fish is different from that of the semi submersible aquaculture platform the comparison shows that løland 1991 and bi et al 2015 overestimated the reduction factor inside and downstream of a traditional fish cage the damping effect of the aquaculture platform on the current is greater than that of the traditional fish cage especially downstream of the aquaculture platform the shielding effect on the current is more significant compared to that of the upstream 4 4 discussion of drag force although plenty of the studies have examined the damping effect of net cages on flow and current loads e g zhao et al 2013a b bi et al 2013 few of them analyzed the asymmetric problems in the distribution of drag force caused by the decrease and unevenness in flow velocity owing to the damping effect the flow velocity inside and downstream of the aquaculture platform has been reduced and distributes not spatially uniformly from the perspective of energy the unevenness of the flow velocity causes the pressure gradient based on the pressure integral the drag force on the upstream and downstream sides of the aquaculture platform is different fig 25 depicts the comparison of the drag force on the upstream and downstream sides of the aquaculture platform at four incoming flow velocities including 0 1033 m s 0 1519 m s 0 2204 m s and 0 2687 m s the results show that the drag force on the upstream and downstream sides of the aquaculture platform is asymmetric and the drag force on the upstream side is greater than that of the downstream side for instance when the incoming flow velocity is 0 2687 m s the drag force on the downstream side of the aquaculture platform is 61 24 of the drag force on the upstream side this indicates that the existence of the aquaculture platform not only causes a certain attenuation of the flow velocity but also results in significant differences in the drag forces on the upstream and downstream sides of the aquaculture platform differs from the traditional fish cage the semi submersible aquaculture platform composes rigid frame and flexible fish nets the drag force obtained through the pressure integral is determined by the common pressure on the rigid frame and the fish net several researchers have shown great interest in the drag force of the only frame or only fish net for the aquaculture platform discussing the drag forces on the fish net and the frame separately helps researchers further understand the distribution of current loads and provides designers with valuable insights into the optimizing of the fish net and the frame as shown in fig 26 the drag force for only net and only frame is described for different incoming flow velocity namely 0 1033 m s 0 1519 m s 0 2204 m s and 0 2687 m s the drag force increases alongside the incoming flow velocity increases comparison has been conducted for the drag force of frame and net and it was found that the drag force acting on the frame was significant than that of the net when the incoming flow velocity is 0 2687 m s it can be calculated that the drag force of the frame is approximate twice the drag force of the net the flow force of the net is obviously weaker than that of the frame in practical engineering even though the fish net is subjected to small current loads comparing to the frame the net is a flexible material and under the action of current loads it is easy to produce large deformation and damage nevertheless it is suggested that the strength of the frame needs to be improved but the improvement of the net cannot be ignored 5 conclusions this paper investigates the hydrodynamics of a semi submersible aquaculture platform in the uniform fluid environment dependent on the existence of net systems the flow velocities and the net solidities the flow velocity distribution near the semi submersible aquaculture platform and the drag force acting on the semi submersible aquaculture platform show distinctive features than that of traditional fish cages the following conclusions can be drawn i for the hydrodynamic characteristics of the flow based on the presence of nets the results indicate that the bottom nets have little effect on the flow field in the upper region of the aquaculture platform and the drag force acting on the aquaculture platform at x 0 25d inside the platform the flow velocity attenuated by 16 15 28 18 28 81 inside the frame only model frame with side nets model and aquaculture platform model respectively correspondingly the presence of the fish net further increases the drag force acting on the aquaculture facility and the drag force acting on the fish net is 55 57 of that on the rigid frame thus the side fish nets greatly influence on the attenuation of the flow velocity and current loads ii for the hydrodynamic characteristics of the flow based on the flow velocities the flow velocity increases alongside the distance downstream from the aquaculture platform when the incoming flow velocity is 0 2204 m s the flow velocity decreases 28 81 at x 0 25d for x equals 1d and 6d downstream of the platform the flow velocity reductions are 38 57 and 28 58 respectively as the distance from the aquaculture platform increases the shielding effect of the aquaculture platform on the flow velocity decreases however the drag force tends to increase as the incoming flow velocity increases iii for the hydrodynamic characteristics of the flow based on the net solidities as the net solidity increases the damping effect of the net systems on the flow also increases when the distance from the center of the aquaculture platform is 0 25d the maximum velocity reduction decreases by 66 10 where the net solidity is 0 45 when the solidity is 0 15 a reduction of 29 36 is obtained the reduction of flow velocity inside and downstream of the aquaculture platform is higher than that of the traditional fish cage for the downstream of the aquaculture platform the shielding effect on the current is too profound to be overlooked in addition the increase of net solidity caused an enhanced drag force acting on the aquaculture platform however the increasing rate of drag force gradually decreases as the solidity increases iv finally the drag force acting on the aquaculture platform is discussed and analyzed the uneven pressure distribution caused the inconsistency of the drag force acting on the upstream and downstream side of the aquaculture platform and the drag force on the upstream side is greater than that on the downstream side compared to the drag force acting on the frame the drag force caused by the fish net cannot be ignored credit authorship contribution statement hang fei liu conceptualization methodology software validation

20315,predicting the distribution of flow velocity inside a semi submersible aquaculture platform and taking measures to optimize the flow field are critical to provide a dependable inhabit for farmed fish this paper examines the hydrodynamics of a semi submersible fish farm under current using the porous media method combined with a rigid wall based on the shear stress transport k omega turbulence model the results show that the presence of nets expands the low flow area and provides a better inhibit for farmed fish in the severe currents the increase of net solidity enhances the damping effect on the flow and it also simultaneously increases the current loads acting on the net the attenuation caused by different net solidities produces a 66 10 deficit of the flow velocity in maximum inside aquaculture platform a maximum increase of 36 82 for the drag force acting on the aquaculture platform is obtained furthermore the distribution of drag force acting on the aquaculture platform in current is also assessed although the drag force of the frame only is approximately twice compared to the net only case the improvement in the strength of the net structure under the action of flow should not be ignored keywords aquaculture platform hydrodynamic flow field drag force porous media 1 introduction aquaculture farming has increased exponentially to meet the world s growing seafood demand in recent years farmed fish as important marine protein production has been widely cultivated around the world bostock et al 2010 to guarantee a natural water environment promote water exchange and improve the survival rate of farmed fish there has been a tendency that shifts towards offshore aquaculture farming due to constrained near shore space and increased environmental pollution however offshore harsh conditions may negatively impact fish growth resulting in low growth rates and higher infection cases harper and wolf 2009 meanwhile the harsh oceanic conditions place heavy design constraints on the structures accordingly aquaculture farming systems must be developed to withstand these conditions in the open ocean to provide a dependable inhabit for the farmed fish as a representative of offshore aquaculture structures the semi submersible rigid cage has been considered a step forward to the new aquaculture era chu et al 2020 these novel structures maintain sufficient volumes and keep farmed fish in place thanks to the rigid frame it seems that engineers show growing interest in favor of rigid aquaculture structures given their potential advantages of durability to the ever changing oceanic conditions in the open ocean the strong current is an unavoidable environmental load for the aquaculture platform although the high flow velocity facilitates the water exchange ensures an adequate supply of dissolved oxygen and significantly reduces the pollution inside the aquaculture platform johansson et al 2007 the high flow velocity also increases the possible death risk of fish and causes damage to the aquaculture platform simultaneously the low flow velocity inside the aquaculture platform reduces the physical friction between the farmed fish and the aquaculture cage but it also leads to insufficient dissolved oxygen and the fish feces could not be diffused timely as a result the probability of fish death is greatly increased hence understanding the fluid net structure interactions xu and qin 2020 predicting the flow velocity distributions inside the aquaculture cages and the current load acting on the aquaculture cages and further taking optimized measures to significantly improve the living environment of the farmed fish are vitally important to avoid economic losses hydrodynamic performance and dynamic response of traditional fish cages have been widely studied through experimental and numerical approaches tsukrov et al 2003 kristiansen et al 2012 2015 zhao et al 2013 xu et al 2013 li et al 2013a 2013b huang et al 2018 gansel et al 2018 however most of them concerned with mooring line force deformation and motions of the fish cage but did not consider the distribution of the flow velocity inside the fish cage among the plenty of factors that need attention the flow field is the essential parameter for the survival of farmed fish efficient water flow exchange can ensure sufficient dissolved oxygen and avoid water pollution in the early stages the single plane net was used as the research object and the water flow field behind and the drag force on the plane net were analyzed based on cfd the low velocity region behind the plane net helps farmed fish avoid casualties under strong currents patursson et al 2006 2010 zhao et al 2013a as the computational efficiency improves the numerical analysis of the flow field inside the entire fish cage such as gravity cages and spherical cages becomes possible the damping effect of single fish cage and multiple cages zhao et al 2013b cornejo et al 2014 tang et al 2017 rickard 2020 bui et al 2020 dong et al 2020 2021 in certain arrangement on the flow was investigated the results showed that the increase in the number of fish cages could aggravate the attenuation of the internal flow velocity of the aquaculture cages and the spacing between the fish cages has a certain impact on the distribution of the flow velocity inside fish cages in addition the net solidity in aquaculture cages is also a contributing factor regarding the flow distribution the impact of net solidity bi et al 2013 2015 2018 tu et al 2020 on the water flow exchange and the attenuation of the flow velocity in the aquaculture systems has been studied though experimental tests computational fluid dynamics model and multi relaxation time mrt lattice boltzmann model although the increase of the net solidity prevents the farmed fish from escaping in the meantime it hinders the exchange of water flow and increases the consumption of dissolved oxygen inside the fish cage causing a great death risk of farmed fish to provide a suitable living environment for farmed fish a novel semi submersible aquaculture platform that consists of flexible nets and rigid frames is proposed to study the flow fields inside and around the structure this semi submersible aquaculture platform has distinct features that are notably different from a traditional fish cage e g the flexible net cage as for the traditional methods the porous media theory only is applied to model the fish net based on the realizable k ε turbulence model and the rigid frame such as rigid aquaculture structure cannot be included zhao et al 2013a b in the present study the semi submersible aquaculture platform consists of fish nets and rigid frames modeled by porous media and rigid wall boundary the presences of fish nets flow velocities and the net solidity are three critical factors that can impact the flow field and current loads the existence of the fish nets makes the distribution of flow velocity and the living environment of fish more complicated the increase of net solidity contributes to the fish net s damping effect and increases the drag force acting on it therefore the present study analyzes the influences of these three factors on the flow field and drag force for the semi submersible aquaculture platforms this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the description of the numerical method to a semi submersible aquaculture platform section 3 describes the physical model test and verifications of the numerical results section 4 provides the numerical results and a thorough discussion regarding the hydrodynamic characteristics of the flow over the aquaculture platform these characteristics are based on three factors namely the presence of nets the flow velocities and the net solidities furthermore the distribution of drag force acting on the aquaculture platform in current is also discussed this is followed by the conclusions of this paper in section 5 2 numerical descriptions 2 1 numerical setup we use the porous media method and rigid wall to predict the flow velocity distribution inside and around a semi submersible aquaculture platform model this model comprises two parts the rigid frame and the net system as depicted in fig 1 the diameter of the aquaculture platform is 1 0 m with a scale of 1 120 the specific structural parameters are illustrated in table 1 and other parameters are presented in our previous study of zhao et al 2019 the sketch of the numerical model setup in a water flume is represented in fig 2 the numerical flume has a dimension of 10 m long 2 m width 1 m depth the distance between the inlet boundary and the center of the aquaculture platform model is 3 m while the one between the outlet boundary and the center of aquaculture platform model is 7 m to ensure that the wake is fully developed the center of the aquaculture platform is 1 m away from the flume wall region 1 2 and 3 are defined as the upstream region aquaculture platform region and downstream region respectively 2 2 governing equations and turbulence model we consider a three dimensional aquaculture

grids and orthogonal hexahedral grids are applied to the fluid region and the porous media region as shown in fig 3 fluid domains such as zone 1 and zone 3 are meshed with orthogonal hexahedral grids and the mesh size is 0 1 m zone 2 including fluid and porous media is meshed by tetrahedral grids zhao et al 2013b reported that the thickness of the porous media did not immensely affect the simulation results therefore a thickness of 5 mm is chosen for the porous media and the smallest size of the grid is set to 0 0025 m for zone 2 and the grid independence study will be addressed in section 3 of this paper three layers grid is adopted near the wall boundary of the flume two layers grid is taken along the direction of thickness for porous media including bottom net and side net and the grid size is 0 0025 m the exact number of grids including total grid fluid grid side net grid and bottom net grid are listed in table 2 a growth rate of 1 2 is set to facilitate the grid smooth connection between the fluid domain and the porous media for zone 2 and the wall the grids near the pontoons columns and braces are refined to ensure that the flow characteristics can be captured we use courant friedrichs lewy cfl number to define the convergence condition of the numerical results the courant number can be calculated by c o u m a x δ t δ x m i n where the δ x m i n is the minimum grid size and u m a x is the maximum flow velocity in the present study with a time step of 0 005 s the minimum grid size δ x m i n 0 0025 m and the maximum flow velocity u m a x 0 2687 m s we yield a cfl number to be less than 1 to meet the convergence condition 2 4 boundary conditions and discretization the origin of the coordinate is defined at the center of the semi submersible aquaculture platform see fig 2 the x axis is along the direction of the water flow and it follows the right hand spiral rule the left boundary of the numerical flume is defined as velocity inlet the right boundary is described by the outflow boundary the water free surface is modeled by wall boundary condition with zero shear force the sides the bottom of the flume and the main frame are defined by stationary wall boundary conditions with no slip to solve the governing equations discretized using the finite volume method the simplec algorithm doormaal and raithby 1984 based on a 3d pressure based solver is applied using cfd software fluent 18 2 from ansys inc the discretization scheme for pressure momentum turbulent kinetic energy and specific dissipation rate is carried out using a second order upwind scheme the simulations are defined as having reached a converged solution when all residuals reduce to less than 0 001 the simplepc algorithm is organized as follows step 1 give an

found in step 4 as the new p return to step 2 cycle through this loop until convergence is achieved 3 verifications for numerical model 3 1 grid independence for the semi submersible aquaculture platform the grid resolution is critical to the convergence of calculations the grids corresponding to different courant numbers deserve further study to ensure the accuracy of the numerical calculations three grid sizes including 0 0025 m 0 0016 m and 0 0013 m are selected to obtain three corresponding courant numbers these are 0 4408 0 6887 and 0 8477 and the incoming flow velocity is 0 2204 m s the current flow distributions over the semi submersible aquaculture platform under these three different courant numbers are shown in fig 4 owing to the extended distance from the aquaculture platform the flow velocity along the direction of incoming flow remains stable and it is not affected by the courant numbers in region 1 see fig 4 however in region 2 due to the existence of the aquaculture platform the flow velocity fluctuates and does not show a steady state furthermore the flow velocity has a reduction after passing through the aquaculture platform compared with region 1 and region 2 the damping effect of the aquaculture platform on the flow is more evident in region 3 and the average relative error reaches 1 41 within a reasonable range through the above analysis the results show that grid size barely affects the simulated results therefore to guarantee accuracy and improve computational efficiency a grid size of 0 0025 m is applied in the rest of the analysis the grid resolution is chosen such that the required accuracy is satisfied but the computational costs are tolerably acceptable 3 2 verification for the plane nets normal to the flow the flow velocity distribution of single plane nets has been measured by zhao et al 2013a the plane nets are normal to the direction of the incoming flow the water depth is 0 7 m in the test and the plane nets have a dimension of 0 4 m height 1 0 m width as shown in fig 5 in the experiment the steady flow is generated by the pump at the end of the flume the acoustic doppler velometer adv is applied to measure the current velocity and the load cell is applied to measure the drag force acting on the fish net to collect accurate data the time series of flow velocity at each measurement point is recorded stable data throughout 10 s is chosen for data analysis and the flow velocity and the drag force are the average value of the corresponding time series in the numerical model the plane net is modeled using the porous media with a thickness of 50 mm the normal viscous resistance coefficient d n and the normal inertial resistance coefficient c n are directly assigned as 75990 m 2 and 8 087 m 1 referred by zhao et al 2013a four flow velocities 0 1590 m s 0 3072 m s 0 4330 m s and 0 5579 m s are chosen as incoming flow velocity the flow velocity distribution and drag force are verified by comparing experimental results and calculated values the flow velocities at the measuring points are presented in fig 5 the relative error is calculated between the experimental and numerical values via r e r r u n u m u e x p u e x p where r e r r is the relative error u n u m is the flow velocity of numerical simulation and u e x p is the measured flow velocity in the test overall the average relative error reaches 3 38 for the flow velocity and 6 10 for the drag force it is indicated from fig 6 and fig 7 that the flow velocity and the drag force from numerical simulation matches well with the experimental values besides the flow velocity has an obvious reduction when the flow passes through the plane nets which can be observed from the flow velocity at positions b and c therefore the shielding effect of fish nets on the flow velocity should be considered and cannot be ignored 3 3 test verification for the semi submersible aquaculture platform a semi submersible aquaculture platform model is studied numerically and compared with experimental tests the physical model test is conducted using a wave current flume at the state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering dalian university of technology dalian china in the experimental test the water depth and draught are respectively 1 0 m and 0 36 m the thickness of porous media is 5 mm which can avoid the effects of the thin columns contained in the porous media on the flow field the considered incoming flow velocities used in the experimental tests are 0 1519 m s and 0 2204 m s respectively the acoustic doppler velometer and the load cell are respectively applied to measure the flow velocity inside and around the semi submersible aquaculture platform model and the drag force acting on the semi submersible aquaculture platform model in addition the flow velocity changes along the incoming flow direction are analyzed the measuring points are arranged in the flume and are placed 19 cm below the water surface as shown in fig 8 the comparison of flow velocity between the experimental and numerical values is presented in fig 9 and fig 10 the average relative error reaches 5 30 for the flow velocity and 2 61 for the drag force this indicates that the numerical results agree well with the experimental values and the relative error is within a reasonable range therefore the numerical method can be applied to predict the flow velocity distribution inside and around the aquaculture platform for different incoming flow velocities as shown in fig 9 the flow velocity has a noticeable reduction along the direction of incoming flow inside and downstream of the aquaculture platform 4 results and discussion it is challenging to obtain the in situ data of the flow field inside and around the aquaculture platform in the open ocean thus in the present study a numerical simulation approach is employed to estimate the flow velocity distribution furthermore the drag force acting on the aquaculture platform a concerning problem for engineers is also estimated 4 1 hydrodynamic characteristics based on the presence of nets net systems are of significance to the aquaculture platform which prevents fish from escaping and provides a stable environment with low flow velocity for farmed fish owning to the existence of net systems the flow velocity distribution inside and around the aquaculture platform becomes complicated to characterize the flow near the aquaculture platform based on the presences of net systems three cases namely the frame only case no fish nets the frame with side nets no bottom nets and the aquaculture platform with side and bottom nets are selected as shown in fig 11 when the flow velocity is 0 2204 m s the magnitude of flow velocity is analyzed along the centerline of the aquaculture platform which is located 0 11 m below the water surface as shown in fig 12 the flow velocity inside the aquaculture platform exhibits slight reduction and fluctuation and the flow velocity downstream of the aquaculture platform first has a reduction near the frame and then remains stable it can be observed from fig 12 that the flow velocity inside the frame is higher than that of the frame with side nets and the aquaculture platform however the flow velocity inside the aquaculture platform is slightly less than that of the frame with side nets and the flow velocity is reversed downstream of the aquaculture platform correspondingly the presence of the fish net further increases the drag force acting on the aquaculture facility and the drag force acting on the fish net is 55 57 of that on the rigid frame as shown in fig 13 the drag force acting on the fish net is relatively small compared to the drag force on the frame and the difference of drag force between the frame with side nets and aquaculture platform is relatively small overall the difference in flow velocity and drag force between the frame with side nets and the aquaculture platform is not apparent further analysis shows that the flow velocity is attenuated by 16 15 28 18 28 81 inside the frame frame with side nets and the aquaculture platform respectively at x 0 25d when the distance from the center of the aquaculture platform is 6d the flow velocity has reductions of 12 30 31 44 and 28 58 regarding the frame frame with side nets and the aquaculture platform therefore it can be concluded that the influence of bottom fish nets on the flow velocity is insignificant and the side fish nets have a great influence on the attenuation of the flow velocity the aquaculture platform is a complex three dimensional structure it makes the flow velocity attenuate to a certain extent and also makes the flow velocity appear a three dimensional spatial distribution as shown in fig 14 the results indicate that the effect of net systems on the flow field cannot be ignored and their existence changes the magnitude and spatial distribution of flow velocity from fig 14 we see that the domain of higher flow velocity inside and downstream of the frame is higher than that of the frame with side nets and the aquaculture platform furthermore by comparing the distribution of flow velocity inside the frame with side nets and the aquaculture platform the existence of the bottom nets has less influence on the distribution of flow velocity in aquaculture engineering high velocity areas inside an aquaculture platform can lead to the destruction of the structure and can damage the living environment of farmed fish when flow velocity is 0 2204 m s the flow velocity distribution inside the frame only case the frame with side nets case and the aquaculture platform case at the x y section of z 0 15 m and z 0 25 m are exhibited in fig 15 since the aquaculture platform is a complex three dimensional structure the flow field presents different distributions at different x y sections by comparing the contours of flow velocity it can be observed that the low velocity area on the cross section of z 0 15 m is higher than the low velocity area on x 0 25 m this is because the flow velocity distribution at the x y section of z 0 15 m is affected by the side nets and the bottom nets bottom braces and pontoons resulting in greater flow attenuation than the flow velocity distribution at x y section of z 0 25 m in addition comparing the flow velocity distribution inside the frame frame with side nets and aquaculture platform high velocity areas inside the frame are more than that inside frame with side nets and aquaculture platform however there is no significant difference in the low flow velocity area at z 0 25 m for the frame with side nets and aquaculture platforms owing to the effect of bottom nets the low velocity area inside the frame with side nets is smaller than inside the aquaculture platform at the x y section of z 0 15 m 4 2 hydrodynamic characteristics based on flow velocities by characterizing the internal and external flow fields of the aquaculture platform at different incoming flow velocities flow velocity distribution at different locations can be obtained these analyses provide guidance for practical aquaculture engineering four incoming flow velocities namely 0 1033 m s 0 1519 m s 0 2204 m s and 0 2687 m s are selected and applied in the present study as exhibited in fig 16 the flow velocity is analyzed along the centerline of the aquaculture platform which is 0 11 m below the water surface the drag force can be described in fig 17 for different incoming flow velocities it can be observed from fig 16 that the flow velocity has a reduction along the direction of the incoming flow in region 1 the flow velocity remains stable and then drops sharply to zero near the column in region 2 compared to the incoming flow velocity the flow velocity falls and fluctuates this is because 1 the flow velocity is attenuated owing to the damping effect of the columns and net systems and 2 the interaction between multiple piles leads to the instability of the flow velocity after the current passes through the aquaculture platform the flow velocity rises but is not as equal as the incoming flow velocity in region 3 the flow velocity fluctuates near the columns and then becomes stable compared to the incoming flow velocity the downstream flow velocity of the aquaculture platform slightly decreases when the incoming flow velocity is 0 2204 m s the percentage of flow velocity reduction r p u 0 u u 0 can be calculated along the incoming flow here u 0 is the incoming flow velocity and u is the flow velocity along the incoming flow direction the flow velocity decreases 28 81 at x 0 25d inside the aquaculture platform d 1 0 m represents the diameter of the aquaculture platform when the distances become 1d and 6d downstream of the aquaculture platform the flow velocity reductions are 38 57 and 28 58 respectively as the distance from the aquaculture platform increases the shielding effect of the aquaculture platform on the flow velocity gradually decreases in addition the drag force acting on the aquaculture platform has a notable increase as the incoming flow velocity increases the increase of incoming flow velocity significantly affects the drag force as shown in fig 17 fig 18 depicts the flow velocity distribution along the direction perpendicular to the incoming flow the flow velocity is zero at y 1 0 m where the flume wall is located the flow velocity increases rapidly and then becomes stable between y 1 0 m and 0 5 m however the flow velocity increases near the columns at y 0 5 m and 0 0 m from the energy perspective pressure energy is converted into kinetic energy when the flow passes over the columns and pontoons for flow around a cylinder the flow velocity should be increased twice the incoming flow velocity however part of the energy will be lost due to the presence of fluid viscosity the flow velocity has a reduction and it presents fluctuation within a certain range between x 0 5 m and x 0 5 m under the influence of the semi submersible aquaculture platform this indicates that the aquaculture platform is a complex structure and that the change of the flow velocity inside the aquaculture platform is not only the effect of one pile but the result of the mutual influence of multiple piles and net systems fig 19 exhibits the flow velocity distribution along the direction of water depth at x 0 25 m the flow velocity maintains a stable value between the bottom of the flume z 0 64 m and the aquaculture platform z 0 m and it attains zero at the wall of the flume and columns at different incoming flow velocities also the flow velocity distribution fluctuates inside the aquaculture platform along with the water depth moreover the magnitude of flow velocity inside the aquaculture platform is significantly less than that outside the aquaculture platform the complexity of the aquaculture platform leads to the instability of the internal flow velocity distribution along with water depth 4 3 hydrodynamic characteristics based on net solidities net solidity is an important indicator to measure the water permeability of fish nets the increase of net solidity can improve the strength of fish nets and reduce the risk of fish escape in practical aquaculture a suitable flow velocity in the range of 0 1 m s to 0 6 m s can provide a safe and comfortable living environment for farmed fish inside the aquaculture platform chu et al 2020 however the excessive net solidity reduces the water permeability of the fish net diminishes the exchange of flow increases the drag force and is not conducive to fish health in addition the increase in the solidity of the net may also be caused by the accumulation of biofouling communities in the seawater which could lead to negative effects on the hydrodynamic behaviors of fish cages bi et al 2015 el thalji 2019 for instance 1 the hydrodynamic forces acting on the fish cage are dramatically increased which increases the risk of its structural failure and fatigue damage 2 biofouling hinders the water exchange capacity leading to insufficient oxygen supply 3 the accumulation of biological attachments can increase the risk of fish diseases therefore the study of hydrodynamic characteristics based on net solidities is of significance for practical aquaculture engineering in the present study four fish nets solidities including 0 15 0 25 0 35 and 0 45 are considered to characterize the flow field of the aquaculture platform and drag force acting on the aquaculture platform the x y section of z 0 25 m is selected and analyzed for the flow velocity and the incoming flow velocity is 0 1519 m s it can be observed from fig 20 and fig 21 that the net solidity has a noticeable influence on the magnitude and distribution of flow velocity as the solidity of the netting increases the flow velocity has a pronounced reduction inside and downstream aquaculture platform the increase of net solidity leads to the increase of flow velocity between the flume and aquaculture platform and there is a small region of flow velocity reduction upstream of the aquaculture platform this could be because the water permeability of the fish nets gradually decreases with the increase of net solidity and the change of the flow direction gets more noticeable around the plane net with increasing solidity on the netting bi et al 2015 for the flow around a cylinder kinetic energy is converted into pressure energy upstream of the aquaculture platform and the flow velocity is reduced on both sides of the aquaculture platform the conversion of pressure energy into kinetic energy causes the flow velocity to increase furthermore this phenomenon becomes more evident as the solidity increases to quantitatively analyze the damping of aquaculture platform with different net solidities the magnitude of flow velocity along the direction of incoming flow velocity are studied as shown in fig 22 it can be observed that there is a noticeable reduction of flow velocity inside and downstream aquaculture platforms for different net solidity as the net solidity increases the damping of the net systems on the flow also increases in region 2 the minimum flow velocity at x 0 25d can reach 0 052 m s for the solidity of 0 45 and the flow velocity is reduced by 66 10 for the solidity of 0 15 the flow velocity attenuation percentage is 29 36 smaller than that of the solidity of 0 45 in region 3 the flow velocity gradually increases as the distance from the aquaculture platform increases the influence of aquaculture platforms on the flow field decreases the flow velocity decreases by 39 10 53 98 65 24 and 72 42 at x 1d for the solidity of 0 15 0 25 0 35 and 0 45 respectively when the distance from the center of the aquaculture platform is 6d the flow velocity decreases by 28 49 40 42 48 78 and 52 80 for the solidity of 0 15 0 25 0 35 and 0 45 respectively although the increase in net solidity will further aggravate the attenuation of the flow velocity there is an increase in the drag force acting on the aquaculture platform due to the increase of solidity as shown in fig 23 after comparing the net solidity of 0 15 and 0 45 it is found that when the net solidity is tripled the drag force acting on the aquaculture platform increases by 36 82 however the increasing rate of drag force gradually decreases as the solidity increases from the flow velocity reduction we see that the damping effect of the semi submersible aquaculture platform on the flow is different from the traditional fish cage and the rigid frame causes the complexity of the flow field the reduction factor calculated in this study is compared with løland 1991 and bi et al 2015 as shown in fig 24 løland 1991 derived the formula of flow velocity reduction by combining theory and experiment for fish cages as follows u u 0 i 1 n c r i 18 where r i is the flow velocity reduction factor and r i 1 0 0 46 c d n c is the number of upstream crossings of other plane nets before the current approaches the actual plane net bi et al 2015 proposed a formula between the flow velocity reduction factor and the drag coefficient c d inside the fish cage and downstream of the fish cage the best fitting correlation can be described as follows r i n 0 0623 c d 2 0 3178 c d 1 19 r d s 0 0386 c d 2 0 6765 c d 1 20 where r i n is the minimum flow velocity reduction factor inside the fish cage r d s is the minimum flow velocity reduction factor downstream of a fish cage the drag coefficient of the net c d is calculated using the empirical formula proposed by løland 1993 c d 0 04 0 04 0 33 s n 6 54 s n 2 4 88 s n 3 c o s α 21 where α 90 α α is the attack angle s n is the net solidity løland 1991 and bi et al 2015 studied traditional fish cages which do not have rigid components such as pontoons columns and braces thus the reduction of flow velocity inside and downstream of traditional fish is different from that of the semi submersible aquaculture platform the comparison shows that løland 1991 and bi et al 2015 overestimated the reduction factor inside and downstream of a traditional fish cage the damping effect of the aquaculture platform on the current is greater than that of the traditional fish cage especially downstream of the aquaculture platform the shielding effect on the current is more significant compared to that of the upstream 4 4 discussion of drag force although plenty of the studies have examined the damping effect of net cages on flow and current loads e g zhao et al 2013a b bi et al 2013 few of them analyzed the asymmetric problems in the distribution of drag force caused by the decrease and unevenness in flow velocity owing to the damping effect the flow velocity inside and downstream of the aquaculture platform has been reduced and distributes not spatially uniformly from the perspective of energy the unevenness of the flow velocity causes the pressure gradient based on the pressure integral the drag force on the upstream and downstream sides of the aquaculture platform is different fig 25 depicts the comparison of the drag force on the upstream and downstream sides of the aquaculture platform at four incoming flow velocities including 0 1033 m s 0 1519 m s 0 2204 m s and 0 2687 m s the results show that the drag force on the upstream and downstream sides of the aquaculture platform is asymmetric and the drag force on the upstream side is greater than that of the downstream side for instance when the incoming flow velocity is 0 2687 m s the drag force on the downstream side of the aquaculture platform is 61 24 of the drag force on the upstream side this indicates that the existence of the aquaculture platform not only causes a certain attenuation of the flow velocity but also results in significant differences in the drag forces on the upstream and downstream sides of the aquaculture platform differs from the traditional fish cage the semi submersible aquaculture platform composes rigid frame and flexible fish nets the drag force obtained through the pressure integral is determined by the common pressure on the rigid frame and the fish net several researchers have shown great interest in the drag force of the only frame or only fish net for the aquaculture platform discussing the drag forces on the fish net and the frame separately helps researchers further understand the distribution of current loads and provides designers with valuable insights into the optimizing of the fish net and the frame as shown in fig 26 the drag force for only net and only frame is described for different incoming flow velocity namely 0 1033 m s 0 1519 m s 0 2204 m s and 0 2687 m s the drag force increases alongside the incoming flow velocity increases comparison has been conducted for the drag force of frame and net and it was found that the drag force acting on the frame was significant than that of the net when the incoming flow velocity is 0 2687 m s it can be calculated that the drag force of the frame is approximate twice the drag force of the net the flow force of the net is obviously weaker than that of the frame in practical engineering even though the fish net is subjected to small current loads comparing to the frame the net is a flexible material and under the action of current loads it is easy to produce large deformation and damage nevertheless it is suggested that the strength of the frame needs to be improved but the improvement of the net cannot be ignored 5 conclusions this paper investigates the hydrodynamics of a semi submersible aquaculture platform in the uniform fluid environment dependent on the existence of net systems the flow velocities and the net solidities the flow velocity distribution near the semi submersible aquaculture platform and the drag force acting on the semi submersible aquaculture platform show distinctive features than that of traditional fish cages the following conclusions can be drawn i for the hydrodynamic characteristics of the flow based on the presence of nets the results indicate that the bottom nets have little effect on the flow field in the upper region of the aquaculture platform and the drag force acting on the aquaculture platform at x 0 25d inside the platform the flow velocity attenuated by 16 15 28 18 28 81 inside the frame only model frame with side nets model and aquaculture platform model respectively correspondingly the presence of the fish net further increases the drag force acting on the aquaculture facility and the drag force acting on the fish net is 55 57 of that on the rigid frame thus the side fish nets greatly influence on the attenuation of the flow velocity and current loads ii for the hydrodynamic characteristics of the flow based on the flow velocities the flow velocity increases alongside the distance downstream from the aquaculture platform when the incoming flow velocity is 0 2204 m s the flow velocity decreases 28 81 at x 0 25d for x equals 1d and 6d downstream of the platform the flow velocity reductions are 38 57 and 28 58 respectively as the distance from the aquaculture platform increases the shielding effect of the aquaculture platform on the flow velocity decreases however the drag force tends to increase as the incoming flow velocity increases iii for the hydrodynamic characteristics of the flow based on the net solidities as the net solidity increases the damping effect of the net systems on the flow also increases when the distance from the center of the aquaculture platform is 0 25d the maximum velocity reduction decreases by 66 10 where the net solidity is 0 45 when the solidity is 0 15 a reduction of 29 36 is obtained the reduction of flow velocity inside and downstream of the aquaculture platform is higher than that of the traditional fish cage for the downstream of the aquaculture platform the shielding effect on the current is too profound to be overlooked in addition the increase of net solidity caused an enhanced drag force acting on the aquaculture platform however the increasing rate of drag force gradually decreases as the solidity increases iv finally the drag force acting on the aquaculture platform is discussed and analyzed the uneven pressure distribution caused the inconsistency of the drag force acting on the upstream and downstream side of the aquaculture platform and the drag force on the upstream side is greater than that on the downstream side compared to the drag force acting on the frame the drag force caused by the fish net cannot be ignored credit authorship contribution statement hang fei liu conceptualization methodology software validation

20316,this paper proposes a method based on the autonomous underwater vehicle auv dynamic model and complex network theory to effectively monitor the abnormal motion conditions of the auv on the vertical plane first of all we simplify the auv s dynamic model and use a neural network to identify its parameters the error between the dynamic model s output and the auv measurement is employed to build a weighted complex network which describes the auv motion condition pattern afterwards the feature matrix is extracted from the complex network finally the support vector machine svm is introduced to classify the feature matrix and the three abnormal motion conditions are classified the experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper can effectively monitor the abnormal motion conditions of auv compared with other advanced methods the performance of the proposed method is greatly improved keywords auv abnormal motion condition dynamic model neural network complex network svm 1 introduction nowadays autonomous underwater vehicles auvs are widely recognized in the fields of national defense marine geology and industry gafurov and klochkov 2015 however with the expansion of application areas auvs are susceptible to strong external disturbances such as ocean current and sudden failures when performing tasks which significantly affect the stability and safety of auvs chu et al 2020 therefore in order to ensure safety and reliability during the mission it is necessary to monitor the abnormal motion conditions of auvs such as propeller winding current research on abnormal condition monitoring mainly focuses on the detection isolation and identification hwang et al 2009 hameed et al 2009 gao et al 2015 the methods of monitoring mainly include signal processing based method model based method and data driven method frank 1990 blanke et al 2006 signal processing based methods ciabattoni et al 2017 used the time domain frequency domain and amplitude of the signal to construct a characteristic spectrum and then distinguished different states of rotating machinery based on simple statistical characteristics wang et al 2019 achieved the detection of three different abnormal conditions by extracting the time frequency characteristics of rotating machinery model based methods liu and he 2015 proposed a method for monitoring the sensor status of a battery management system based on a lithium battery equivalent model xiong et al 2019 proposed a method to monitor the status of battery packs by using the estimation model and the coulometer to generate the residual soc data driven methods nascimento and valdenegro toro 2018 used recurrent neural network rnn to monitor the condition of underwater propellers this method inputs the voltage speed and current signals of the motor into the rnn for training and distinguishes the damage degree of propeller kao et al 2018 proposed a method to monitor the state of the motor using a 1 d convolutional neural network cnn with stator current as input experimental results show that this method can effectively distinguish five different states of the motor under a wide speed range for auv model based is a widely used method for abnormal motion condition monitoring sun et al 2016 however the accuracy of the model often becomes one of the key issues that affect the effectiveness of the above method lyu et al 2019 xu et al 2020 at present the methods of obtaining auv dynamic model mainly include pool test allotta et al 2018 computational fluid dynamics method zheng et al 2017 and system parameter identification rypkema et al 2018 among them the system parameter identification method has the characteristics of simple application and high identification accuracy which is widely used in the construction of various dynamic models eng et al 2015 wei et al 2017 common identification methods are least square ls method extended kalman filter wei et al 2017 and neural network nn nascimento and valdenegro toro 2018 etc due to the nn has strong non linear processing ability and self optimization ability this paper uses neural network to identify the parameters of the auv dynamic model with constraints in fact for model based methods another problem is how to effectively analyze the characteristics of abnormal conditions from the residual sequence and the residual sequence means the deviation between the model s output and the measurement nowadays the main methods include threshold method time frequency method and artificial intelligence method among them the difficulty of the threshold method is how to choose the threshold reasonably yu et al 2019 the time frequency feature extraction method is easy to be restricted by the method itself resulting in the false information ciabattoni et al 2017 li et al 2017 sejdic et al 2009 the artificial intelligence method has an unknown internal structure and it is difficult for users to analyze the physical characteristics of abnormal situations lei et al 2020 in recent years with in depth study on complex networks zou et al 2019 researchers have found that complex networks have greater advantages in accurately describing highly nonlinear systems and solving complex practical problems amaral and ottino 2004 in view of auv zheng et al 2019 proposed a method to analyze navigation status based on a complex network this method symbolizes the heading data of the auv and uses the symbolized feature sequence to construct a complex network although this paper proposes an effective method for describing the state of auv this method only uses the changing trend of heading data which results in a single node component and cannot fully describe the state of auv to accurately monitor the motion conditions of the auv on the vertical plane such as fixed depth fixed height floating or diving motion this paper proposes a method based on the dynamic model and complex network theory model cn first we introduce the nn to identify the dynamic model of auv with constraints subsequently the deviations between model and measurement are applied to construct complex networks and extract features of complex networks finally the support vector machine svm is used to distinguish diverse conditions in this paper the dynamic model combined with complex network theory which provides a new perspective for monitoring the motion condition of the auv the rest of this paper is organized as follows the second part is a systematic introduction to the experimental carrier the third part uses the neural network to identify the parameters of the auv dynamic model and introduces the method of constructing the complex network the fourth part mainly focuses on the experiments and the effectiveness of the proposed method finally the conclusion of this paper is put into the fifth part 2 experiment carrier information the auv carrier is the sailfish 324 high end auv independently developed by the underwater vehicle laboratory of ocean university of china see fig 1 the displacement of auv is 260 kg its length is 3 8 m and the diameter is 32 4 cm sailfish 324 is composed of navigation and positioning system control system propulsion system communication system and data driven system the speed information attitude information and motor information used in this paper are provided by doppler velocity log dvl inertial navigation system ins and motor driver mu et al 2019 3 the proposed method 3 1 the method flow this paper proposes an abnormal motion conditions monitoring method based on the auv dynamic model and complex network theory firstly the dynamic model with constraints is identified by the nn subsequently the errors between the model and the actual measurement are used as the state nodes to construct a weighted complex network finally the feature matrix of the complex network is extracted the svm is used to classify the different conditions the algorithm flow chart is shown in fig 2 3 2 the dynamic model of auv the notation term and coordinate system of auv are defined by society of naval architects and marine engineers sname and international towing tank conference ittc the coordinate system o x y z with origin o is conveniently fixed to the auv and is called the body fixed reference frame the coordinate system e ξ η ζ whose origin is fixed on the earth is called the world fixed reference frame see fig 3 gao et al 2020 and the notations are summarized in table 1 it is usually assumed that the auv is symmetric about the x z plane therefore the force of the auv can be divided into two parts hydrodynamic force these forces are generated by the movement of the auv in the flow field and additional forces such as rudder force propeller force gravity and buoyancy etc the auv 6 degree of freedom dof equation can be written as 1 1 m ν τ g p f o t h e r c ν ν d ν ν f v i s where m denotes the inertia matrix including added mass ν is linear and angular accelerations τ is vector of control inputs ν is linear and angular velocity vector p denotes the position and orientation vector c ν denotes the matrix of coriolis and centripetal terms including added mass d ν respects the damping matrix g p respects the vector of gravitational forces and moments in this paper we first reduce the dynamic model 1 to 3 dof for the complete model please refer to wan et al 2019 and simplify it using assumptions assumption intersecting inertia e g i x y i x z and i y z is assumed to be zero because they are sufficiently small compared to torque inertia e g i x x i y y and i z z then eq 1 can be expanded and written as 2 m x u u m z g q m y g r w b s i n θ x u u u u x w q m w q x q q m g q 2 x v r m v r x r r m x g r 2 x p r o p n 2 m y v v m x g y r r y v v v v y r r r r y u r m u r m z g q r m y w w m x g z q q w b c o s θ z w w w w z q q q q z u q m u q z u w u w the auv dynamic model is divided into two parts the left side is the acceleration term of the equation and the right side includes hydrostatic force dynamic resistance and control force from eq 2 it can be seen that there is a complex nonlinear relationship between the variables in the dynamic model however when the hydrodynamic coefficients are stable sudden changes would inevitably affect the output of the model in fact in the auv s depth control system the pitch angle is usually used for inner loop control that means compared with depth the pitch angle changes more frequently and can better reflect the changing characteristics of the auv s movement on the vertical plane hence eq 2 are processed to obtain 3 3 s i n θ α 1 u α 2 n 2 α 3 q α 4 r α 5 u u α 6 w q α 7 q 2 α 8 v r α 9 r 2 c o s θ β 1 w β 2 q β 3 w w β 4 q q β 5 u q β 6 u w where the coefficients such as m z g etc in eqs 2 are converted into unknown coefficients α 1 9 and β 1 6 in 3 which eliminates the need to measure them kim et al 2018 the pitch angle is put on the left side of the equation and the unknown parameters are placed on the right side in this way we can find that there is a constraint relationship on the right side of 3 that is the sum of the squares of the two is fixed that illustrates the pitch angle of the auv is determined by 14 different variables in 3 and the variables are constrained fig 4 shows the structure of parameter identification using nn it contains 14 input variables 1 hidden layer and 1 output variable the 14 input variables include u u n 2 q r u w q q 2 v r r 2 w w w u w u q q q these variables can be obtained by sensors or simple calculations so a dynamic model with good generalization and high accuracy can be obtained the output of the nn is the pitch angle of the auv it should be noted that this method converts the unknown parameters α 1 9 and β 1 6 into nn parameters once the nn is trained these parameters are fixed 3 3 the generation of complex network after the mentioned dynamic model is constructed the deviation between the model and the measurement is applied to build a complex network to monitor the motion conditions of the auv the complex network developed in recent years is a brand new and effective tool for analyzing complex systems each element in the complex system is abstracted into nodes through various mapping methods and the interaction between each element is abstracted into edges thereby transforming a complex system into a complex network xu et al 2008 luque et al 2009 an et al 2014 for the two time sequences f 1 f 2 f i f n the measured pitch angles from ins and g 1 g 2 g i g n the outputs of dynamic model they are defined in terms of amplitude and trend change to describe their relationship the definition process is shown in fig 5 the amplitude deviation at i t h moment is defined as e i f i g i in this paper we make the following set when e i is less than 1 it is considered as a low deviation l and in other cases expressed as high deviation h the changing trends at the i t h time are first defined as k 1 i f i f i 1 and k 2 i g i g i 1 if k 1 i k 2 i 0 which is defined as positive p otherwise it is defined as negative n the output in fig 5 represents the state deviations of the two sequences each state deviation contains two different state variables in order to facilitate subsequent processing the state deviations need to be symbolized table 2 shows the relationship between the state deviations and the symbol in this section we have completed the symbolization of the state deviations between the model and the ins this step can effectively increase the complexity of the auv state and facilitate the construction of complex networks wei dong et al 2010 afterwards the length of the sliding window n for generating complex network nodes is defined to divide the symbol sequence into different patterns the sliding window can ensure that the fluctuation pattern exhibits the characteristics of memory diversity and transitivity xiang yun et al 2012 this paper studies the variation of fluctuation with time taking n 3 as an example and the definition process is shown in fig 6 the sliding window moves over time thus the fluctuation pattern also transforms over time the form of change is a b c b c d see fig 6 afterwards these nodes are utilized as the nodes of the network the transition between different nodes is defined as the edge and the frequency of transition between different nodes is defined as the weight as shown in fig 7 by analyzing the topological statistical characteristics of the constructed complex network the transition law between auv states can be accurately and effectively described 3 4 the feature extraction from the complex network in the normal condition the steady node is a a a and this node should have a high proportion when the auv is in an abnormal condition to better describe the auv state this paper divides the nodes into abnormal steady nodes and abnormal transient nodes among them the abnormal steady nodes include b b b c c c d d d and abnormal transient nodes are composed of other nodes such as b b c c c a d d b and so on it should be noted that the distinction between steady nodes and transient nodes only indicates different abnormal fluctuation patterns and is not affected by the proportion here this paper analyzes the laws of the three abnormal conditions of auv and the residual sequence of the abnormal conditions is shown in fig 8 abnormal condition 1 the fluctuation starts from a a a after a limited number of conversions it finally reaches an abnormal stable node with the disappearance of the abnormal interference the auv finally returns from the abnormally stable node to a a a abnormal condition 2 the fluctuation starts from a a a and reaches an abnormally stable node after a limited number of changes then it quickly returns to a a a this state is similar to abnormal condition 1 but the pattern is relatively simple abnormal condition 3 the pattern started from a a a and after a series of changes it finally remained in a specific abnormal fluctuation pattern subsequently based on the mentioned fluctuation laws we propose a feature extraction method based on complex network theory the extracted network features include the relative shortest path between abnormal steady nodes the strength coefficient of steady nodes and the self transition probability of steady nodes it should be noted that the details of several algorithms mentioned in this section can be referred to zou et al 2019 3 4 1 the relative shortest path in complex network theory the shortest path refers to the minimum number of edges connecting any two nodes so the shortest path is introduced to study the state transition between different nodes dijkstra s algorithm is usually employed for weighted complex networks to calculate the shortest path between two nodes the calculation formula is presented as follows 4 l i j m i n m n n m n w m n where n is the node set between nodes i and j w m n is the weight of the edge between nodes m and n and l i j is the shortest distance from node i to j to avoid the impact of different network structures this paper describes the characteristics of the network by defining the relative shortest path the calculation formula is as follows 5 r l i j i j m i j l i j a v r l where m is the steady node set under abnormal conditions and a v r l is the average shortest path length of the network 3 4 2 the strength coefficient node strength is a key indicator to measure the importance of nodes in a directed weighted network a node s strength can be expressed as the number of nodes adjacent to the node and the number of connections the node strength can be presented as 6 n s i j k w i j where n s i is the strength of node i k is the set of neighbor nodes of i and w i j is the weight of edge between i and j it should be noted that this paper considers the self loop of the node when solving the node strength to compare the strength of nodes under different networks more intuitively this paper defines the node s strength coefficient the calculation method is as follows 7 p n s i n s i j a n s j where a is the set of all nodes in the complex network 3 4 3 the self transition probability in a complex network a node s self transition probability is an important indicator to measure the stability of the node s fluctuation in a weighted directed network the transition probability of a node is defined as the ratio of the weight and the node strength as shown below 8 p r i j w i j n s i where w i j is the edge weight from node i to j and n s i is the strength of node i when i j the transition probability is converted to the self transition probability of node i 3 5 support vector machine support vector machine svm is a supervised learning algorithm which is widely applied in binary or multi classification problems besides even in the case of small samples svm with a kernel can still be introduced to classify complex and non linear targets svm is based on the concept of margin detection which separates two or more types of objects equally by constructing a hyperplane an appropriate boundary has the longest distance for the nearest object therefore svm is also called a large margin classifier the closest object is called the support vector and the hyperplane are usually defined by the kernel function as a common classifier svm is not described too much in this paper for detailed content please refer to jufri et al 2019 4 experimental results and discussion 4 1 accuracy verification of auv dynamic model this section discusses the accuracy of the obtained dynamic model the training performance is represented by mean square error m s e which is defined as follows 9 m s e 1 t i 1 t θ i θ t a r i 2 where t is the number of training times θ i is the output by the neural network and θ t a r i is the target pitch angle the transfer function is used to calculate the layers output from the network input the transfer function is defined as follows 10 f x 2 1 e 2 x 1 according to the levenberg marquardt optimization algorithm the bayesian regularization back propagation training method is used to update the weights and bias validation stops are disabled val fail 0 to continue training until the best combination of error and weight is determined tian et al 2018 fig 9 proposes a training performance of the nn the best m s e is 0 089865 in the 428 t h generation fig 10 shows the training state of the neural network this paper uses data sets under different sea conditions to verify the accuracy of the proposed model and compares it with the model identified by the ls method and the model obtained only by the nn as shown in fig 11 fig 11 illustrates the performance of the obtained three models under various sea conditions the black solid line is the measurement result of the ins the red solid line is the output of the model proposed in this paper the blue dashed line is the output of the nn model and the green dashed line is the output of the model obtained by the ls method the experimental results show that the model identified by the ls method has a large error between the output and the measurement in the diving stage whether the amplitude or the changing trend the output results from the proposed model and nn model are consistent with the measurement therefore to show the performance between them more directly the errors of the three models are shown in fig 12 and the average error and root mean square error rmse of the three models are shown in table 3 fig 12 shows the error between the output of the three models and the measurement it can be seen that for the ls model the maximum error occurs in the auv diving stage and the error amplitude exceeds 6 degrees furthermore the error is relatively small in the floating and fixed depth stage most of which are between 2 and 0 as shown in table 3 the average error of the ls model is 0 2577 and the rmse is 25 538 for the nn model and the proposed model most errors are in the range of 1 1 and a small part is in the range of 2 2 the accuracy of these two models is higher than that of the ls model it can be seen from table 3 the average error of the nn model is 0 1269 and the rmse is 0 2309 the average error of the model proposed in this paper is 0 0349 and its rmse is 0 1928 this shows that the estimation accuracy of the proposed model is higher than that of the nn model moreover compared with the nn model the proposed model has smaller error fluctuations therefore based on the above analysis we can conclude that the proposed model can more accurately estimate the change of the auv pitch angle compared with the other two models 4 2 discussion on feature extraction of complex networks as discussed before in part 3 section 4 the feature extraction of complex networks is an important part of the proposed method therefore we focus on the effectiveness of the extracted features for state classification in this section fig 13 shows the complex networks corresponding to the four conditions 4 2 1 the relative shortest path the average relative shortest paths of the four conditions are summarized in table 4 as discussed in section 4 1 compared with the measured pitch angles the model deviations are mostly in the range of 1 1 and the other few are in the range of 2 2 and the range of 3 3 the abnormal nodes would still appear even in normal condition however compared with other situations they appear less frequently table 4 presents that the average relative shortest path in normal condition is 10 59 which is smaller than the abnormal condition 1 and 2 19 44 and 12 57 respectively the relative shortest path of abnormal condition 3 is 0 which means that there are no connections between abnormal steady nodes the above results demonstrate that there is a clear difference between the four conditions it can be explained that using the relatively shortest path as the classification feature can effectively improve the accuracy 4 2 2 the strength coefficients fig 14 shows the average strength coefficients of the steady nodes in four conditions which are summarized in table 5 it can be seen that the strength coefficients are significantly different in the four conditions under normal condition a a a has a larger proportion in all nodes with an average of 0 745 however b b b c c c and d d d have lower proportions which are 0 063 0 051 and 0 014 respectively considering abnormal condition 1 the average strength coefficient of a a a is 0 1274 while c c c increases to 0 425 and b b b and d d d are 0 019 and 0 117 respectively for abnormal condition 2 the average strength coefficients of each steady node are between the normal condition and abnormal condition 1 that is the proportions of a a a and b b b are lower than the normal condition and higher than the abnormal condition 1 the nodes c c c and d d d are higher than the normal condition and lower than the abnormal condition 1 in abnormal condition 3 the strength coefficient of c c c exceeds 0 89 while the other steady nodes are 0 through the above analysis it can be explained that for different conditions the strength coefficients have obvious different patterns this feature also helps to identify and classify states 4 2 3 the self transition probability fig 15 shows the average self transition probability in the four conditions and the results are summarized in table 6 it can be seen from the definition that this feature is related to the stability of the nodes in the four conditions the self transition probability of a a a is 0 948 0 773 0 914 and 0 respectively for node b b b its stability is in the normal condition similar to abnormal condition 1 and 2 self transition probability is 0 353 0 287 and 0 353 respectively and it is quite different from abnormal condition 3 self transition probability is 0 the stability of c c c and d d d in the abnormal condition is significantly different from that in normal condition among them node c c c exhibits extremely high stability in abnormal condition 3 the probability of self transition is 0 991 obviously according to the above analysis the self transition probability can also effectively characterize the difference of networks in different conditions 4 2 4 the discussion for observed patterns the three characteristics used in this paper describe the auv conditions fluctuation law from different perspectives fig 8 shows the error of the three abnormal motion conditions due to the auv fluctuates drastically in abnormal condition 1 the transient nodes increase afterwards the conversion path between abnormal steady nodes becomes longer that is the shortest path between steady nodes grows considering that the number of nodes for constructing complex networks is fixed the growth of transient nodes would reduce the number of steady nodes moreover the auv is in an abnormal motion condition the number of a a a decreases and the abnormal steady nodes increase so the corresponding nodes strength coefficient changes as shown in fig 6 drastic fluctuations in the pitch angle result in more state transitions then from the definition of node self transition probability the stability of a a a decreases while the stability of abnormally steady nodes increases when the auv is in abnormal condition 2 see fig 8 b its state fluctuation is weaker than that in abnormal condition 1 but it is still higher than the normal condition therefore the corresponding shortest path length is between the abnormal condition 1 and the normal condition in this state normal nodes increase and abnormal nodes decrease in the network the corresponding node strength coefficient also changes in addition the auv fluctuates relatively smoothly and the corresponding normal nodes and abnormal steady nodes are relatively stable when the auv is in abnormal condition 3 it can be seen from fig 8 c that the fluctuation pattern of the auv does not change significantly all states only contain a certain abnormal steady node and the complex network formed is relatively simple therefore the shortest path length between abnormal steady nodes is 0 and the node strength coefficient and self transition probability are relatively large 4 3 comparison of various monitoring methods this paper compares the classical time frequency analysis method and the artificial intelligence method to verify the performance of the proposed method model cn svm among them the classic time frequency analysis method applies wavelet packet transform wpt and svm lu et al 2019 and the artificial intelligence method uses 1 d cnn kao et al 2018 the computer configuration employed to verify the method is intel r core tm i7 7500u cpu 2 7 ghz and the memory is 8gb in this paper the networkx library is introduced to build complex networks and extract features the pytorch library is used to construct the 1 d cnn network and the svm is implemented through libsvm and 576 samples are collected including normal condition abnormal condition 1 2 and 3 each sample contains 300 data points of which 350 data samples are used in the training set 100 samples are used in the validation set and 126 samples are used in the testing set the experimental results are summarized in fig 16 it can be seen that wpt svm has achieved great detection results for normal condition and abnormal condition 3 and its accuracy is 0 727 and 0 929 respectively however the accuracy of abnormal condition 2 and 3 is only 0 357 and 0 538 which means the method is invalid for them for the normal condition and abnormal condition 3 the accuracy of 1 d cnn is 0 946 and 0 99 compared with the wpt svm method its accuracy has improved by 23 2 and 7 1 respectively unfortunately the accuracy of this method for abnormal condition 1 and 2 is only 0 45 and 0 588 although the performance is improved compared with wpt svm by 16 7 and 8 5 respectively its accuracy is still around 0 5 which also means that this method cannot distinguish abnormal conditions 1 and 2 well in fact compared with the mentioned two methods the proposed method shows significantly performance for the normal condition model cn svm reaches 0 872 which improves the performance by 16 6 compared with wpt svm but the accuracy drops by 7 8 compared with 1 d cnn however it should be noticed that model cn svm can accurately identify abnormal condition 1 with an accuracy of 0 886 compared with the other two methods wpt svm and 1 d cnn the accuracy is improved by 57 7 and 49 2 respectively for abnormal condition 2 the accuracy of model cn svm is 0 875 which is an improvement compared with the other two methods with an increase of 38 5 and 32 8 respectively for abnormal condition 3 the accuracy of the proposed method is 0 99 which is the same as the 1 d cnn and slightly higher than the wpt svm in summary the proposed method can effectively identify and distinguish the above four conditions and achieve high accuracy the proposed method is more suitable for our self developed auv than the other two methods the software system of sailfish 324 uses moos ivp to ensure the real time of auv the maximum frequency of sensor data transmission should be lower than 10 hz for the wpt method it is not easy to extract effective feature information when processing low frequency signals for deep learning methods the classification accuracy depends on the data sets and the data sets used in this paper are all from ocean trials in fact it is difficult to obtain a large amount of abnormal data during the sea trials therefore under the premise of insufficient data sets 1 d cnn cannot achieve high classification accuracy the proposed method converts the motion states of the auv into a complex network for analysis this method uses a sliding window to process time series defines the state in a small time scale as a node builds a complex network through the state transition relations extracts topological feature parameters and characterizes the auv s motion state law for this reason compared with wpt and 1 d cnn it is more suitable for feature extraction and analysis of low frequency and small sample data 5 conclusion this paper presents an auv abnormal motion condition monitoring method which is composed of the dynamic model complex network theory and svm among them the dynamic model is employed to estimate the pitch angle of the auv in the normal motion condition the complex network theory is applied to extract the characteristics of the different conditions and the svm is used to monitor and distinguish the abnormal motion conditions of the auv the accuracy of the proposed method is improved by considering the auv states the fluctuation laws and the feature extractions by dividing the abnormal nodes into abnormal steady nodes and abnormal transient nodes the state fluctuation in different conditions can be described more clearly and accurately subsequently the auv conditions are analyzed according to different fluctuation patterns and its fluctuation laws are proposed finally based on the proposed fluctuation laws the complex network theory is introduced to extract the characteristics of auv the results demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately identify the normal and abnormal conditions and can accurately classify the abnormal motion conditions therefore the proposed monitoring method can be effectively applied to auv motion status monitoring declaration of competing

20316,this paper proposes a method based on the autonomous underwater vehicle auv dynamic model and complex network theory to effectively monitor the abnormal motion conditions of the auv on the vertical plane first of all we simplify the auv s dynamic model and use a neural network to identify its parameters the error between the dynamic model s output and the auv measurement is employed to build a weighted complex network which describes the auv motion condition pattern afterwards the feature matrix is extracted from the complex network finally the support vector machine svm is introduced to classify the feature matrix and the three abnormal motion conditions are classified the experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper can effectively monitor the abnormal motion conditions of auv compared with other advanced methods the performance of the proposed method is greatly improved keywords auv abnormal motion condition dynamic model neural network complex network svm 1 introduction nowadays autonomous underwater vehicles auvs are widely recognized in the fields of national defense marine geology and industry gafurov and klochkov 2015 however with the expansion of application areas auvs are susceptible to strong external disturbances such as ocean current and sudden failures when performing tasks which significantly affect the stability and safety of auvs chu et al 2020 therefore in order to ensure safety and reliability during the mission it is necessary to monitor the abnormal motion conditions of auvs such as propeller winding current research on abnormal condition monitoring mainly focuses on the detection isolation and identification hwang et al 2009 hameed et al 2009 gao et al 2015 the methods of monitoring mainly include signal processing based method model based method and data driven method frank 1990 blanke et al 2006 signal processing based methods ciabattoni et al 2017 used the time domain frequency domain and amplitude of the signal to construct a characteristic spectrum and then distinguished different states of rotating machinery based on simple statistical characteristics wang et al 2019 achieved the detection of three different abnormal conditions by extracting the time frequency characteristics of rotating machinery model based methods liu and he 2015 proposed a method for monitoring the sensor status of a battery management system based on a lithium battery equivalent model xiong et al 2019 proposed a method to monitor the status of battery packs by using the estimation model and the coulometer to generate the residual soc data driven methods nascimento and valdenegro toro 2018 used recurrent neural network rnn to monitor the condition of underwater propellers this method inputs the voltage speed and current signals of the motor into the rnn for training and distinguishes the damage degree of propeller kao et al 2018 proposed a method to monitor the state of the motor using a 1 d convolutional neural network cnn with stator current as input experimental results show that this method can effectively distinguish five different states of the motor under a wide speed range for auv model based is a widely used method for abnormal motion condition monitoring sun et al 2016 however the accuracy of the model often becomes one of the key issues that affect the effectiveness of the above method lyu et al 2019 xu et al 2020 at present the methods of obtaining auv dynamic model mainly include pool test allotta et al 2018 computational fluid dynamics method zheng et al 2017 and system parameter identification rypkema et al 2018 among them the system parameter identification method has the characteristics of simple application and high identification accuracy which is widely used in the construction of various dynamic models eng et al 2015 wei et al 2017 common identification methods are least square ls method extended kalman filter wei et al 2017 and neural network nn nascimento and valdenegro toro 2018 etc due to the nn has strong non linear processing ability and self optimization ability this paper uses neural network to identify the parameters of the auv dynamic model with constraints in fact for model based methods another problem is how to effectively analyze the characteristics of abnormal conditions from the residual sequence and the residual sequence means the deviation between the model s output and the measurement nowadays the main methods include threshold method time frequency method and artificial intelligence method among them the difficulty of the threshold method is how to choose the threshold reasonably yu et al 2019 the time frequency feature extraction method is easy to be restricted by the method itself resulting in the false information ciabattoni et al 2017 li et al 2017 sejdic et al 2009 the artificial intelligence method has an unknown internal structure and it is difficult for users to analyze the physical characteristics of abnormal situations lei et al 2020 in recent years with in depth study on complex networks zou et al 2019 researchers have found that complex networks have greater advantages in accurately describing highly nonlinear systems and solving complex practical problems amaral and ottino 2004 in view of auv zheng et al 2019 proposed a method to analyze navigation status based on a complex network this method symbolizes the heading data of the auv and uses the symbolized feature sequence to construct a complex network although this paper proposes an effective method for describing the state of auv this method only uses the changing trend of heading data which results in a single node component and cannot fully describe the state of auv to accurately monitor the motion conditions of the auv on the vertical plane such as fixed depth fixed height floating or diving motion this paper proposes a method based on the dynamic model and complex network theory model cn first we introduce the nn to identify the dynamic model of auv with constraints subsequently the deviations between model and measurement are applied to construct complex networks and extract features of complex networks finally the support vector machine svm is used to distinguish diverse conditions in this paper the dynamic model combined with complex network theory which provides a new perspective for monitoring the motion condition of the auv the rest of this paper is organized as follows the second part is a systematic introduction to the experimental carrier the third part uses the neural network to identify the parameters of the auv dynamic model and introduces the method of constructing the complex network the fourth part mainly focuses on the experiments and the effectiveness of the proposed method finally the conclusion of this paper is put into the fifth part 2 experiment carrier information the auv carrier is the sailfish 324 high end auv independently developed by the underwater vehicle laboratory of ocean university of china see fig 1 the displacement of auv is 260 kg its length is 3 8 m and the diameter is 32 4 cm sailfish 324 is composed of navigation and positioning system control system propulsion system communication system and data driven system the speed information attitude information and motor information used in this paper are provided by doppler velocity log dvl inertial navigation system ins and motor driver mu et al 2019 3 the proposed method 3 1 the method flow this paper proposes an abnormal motion conditions monitoring method based on the auv dynamic model and complex network theory firstly the dynamic model with constraints is identified by the nn subsequently the errors between the model and the actual measurement are used as the state nodes to construct a weighted complex network finally the feature matrix of the complex network is extracted the svm is used to classify the different conditions the algorithm flow chart is shown in fig 2 3 2 the dynamic model of auv the notation term and coordinate system of auv are defined by society of naval architects and marine engineers sname and international towing tank conference ittc the coordinate system o x y z with origin o is conveniently fixed to the auv and is called the body fixed reference frame the coordinate system e ξ η ζ whose origin is fixed on the earth is called the world fixed reference frame see fig 3 gao et al 2020 and the notations are summarized in table 1 it is usually assumed that the auv is symmetric about the x z plane therefore the force of the auv can be divided into two parts hydrodynamic force these forces are generated by the movement of the auv in the flow field and additional forces such as rudder force propeller force gravity and buoyancy etc the auv 6 degree of freedom dof equation can be written as 1 1 m ν τ g p f o t h e r c ν ν d ν ν f v i s where m denotes the inertia matrix including added mass ν is linear and angular accelerations τ is vector of control inputs ν is linear and angular velocity vector p denotes the position and orientation vector c ν denotes the matrix of coriolis and centripetal terms including added mass d ν respects the damping matrix g p respects the vector of gravitational forces and moments in this paper we first reduce the dynamic model 1 to 3 dof for the complete model please refer to wan et al 2019 and simplify it using assumptions assumption intersecting inertia e g i x y i x z and i y z is assumed to be zero because they are sufficiently small compared to torque inertia e g i x x i y y and i z z then eq 1 can be expanded and written as 2 m x u u m z g q m y g r w b s i n θ x u u u u x w q m w q x q q m g q 2 x v r m v r x r r m x g r 2 x p r o p n 2 m y v v m x g y r r y v v v v y r r r r y u r m u r m z g q r m y w w m x g z q q w b c o s θ z w w w w z q q q q z u q m u q z u w u w the auv dynamic model is divided into two parts the left side is the acceleration term of the equation and the right side includes hydrostatic force dynamic resistance and control force from eq 2 it can be seen that there is a complex nonlinear relationship between the variables in the dynamic model however when the hydrodynamic coefficients are stable sudden changes would inevitably affect the output of the model in fact in the auv s depth control system the pitch angle is usually used for inner loop control that means compared with depth the pitch angle changes more frequently and can better reflect the changing characteristics of the auv s movement on the vertical plane hence eq 2 are processed to obtain 3 3 s i n θ α 1 u α 2 n 2 α 3 q α 4 r α 5 u u α 6 w q α 7 q 2 α 8 v r α 9 r 2 c o s θ β 1 w β 2 q β 3 w w β 4 q q β 5 u q β 6 u w where the coefficients such as m z g etc in eqs 2 are converted into unknown coefficients α 1 9 and β 1 6 in 3 which eliminates the need to measure them kim et al 2018 the pitch angle is put on the left side of the equation and the unknown parameters are placed on the right side in this way we can find that there is a constraint relationship on the right side of 3 that is the sum of the squares of the two is fixed that illustrates the pitch angle of the auv is determined by 14 different variables in 3 and the variables are constrained fig 4 shows the structure of parameter identification using nn it contains 14 input variables 1 hidden layer and 1 output variable the 14 input variables include u u n 2 q r u w q q 2 v r r 2 w w w u w u q q q these variables can be obtained by sensors or simple calculations so a dynamic model with good generalization and high accuracy can be obtained the output of the nn is the pitch angle of the auv it should be noted that this method converts the unknown parameters α 1 9 and β 1 6 into nn parameters once the nn is trained these parameters are fixed 3 3 the generation of complex network after the mentioned dynamic model is constructed the deviation between the model and the measurement is applied to build a complex network to monitor the motion conditions of the auv the complex network developed in recent years is a brand new and effective tool for analyzing complex systems each element in the complex system is abstracted into nodes through various mapping methods and the interaction between each element is abstracted into edges thereby transforming a complex system into a complex network xu et al 2008 luque et al 2009 an et al 2014 for the two time sequences f 1 f 2 f i f n the measured pitch angles from ins and g 1 g 2 g i g n the outputs of dynamic model they are defined in terms of amplitude and trend change to describe their relationship the definition process is shown in fig 5 the amplitude deviation at i t h moment is defined as e i f i g i in this paper we make the following set when e i is less than 1 it is considered as a low deviation l and in other cases expressed as high deviation h the changing trends at the i t h time are first defined as k 1 i f i f i 1 and k 2 i g i g i 1 if k 1 i k 2 i 0 which is defined as positive p otherwise it is defined as negative n the output in fig 5 represents the state deviations of the two sequences each state deviation contains two different state variables in order to facilitate subsequent processing the state deviations need to be symbolized table 2 shows the relationship between the state deviations and the symbol in this section we have completed the symbolization of the state deviations between the model and the ins this step can effectively increase the complexity of the auv state and facilitate the construction of complex networks wei dong et al 2010 afterwards the length of the sliding window n for generating complex network nodes is defined to divide the symbol sequence into different patterns the sliding window can ensure that the fluctuation pattern exhibits the characteristics of memory diversity and transitivity xiang yun et al 2012 this paper studies the variation of fluctuation with time taking n 3 as an example and the definition process is shown in fig 6 the sliding window moves over time thus the fluctuation pattern also transforms over time the form of change is a b c b c d see fig 6 afterwards these nodes are utilized as the nodes of the network the transition between different nodes is defined as the edge and the frequency of transition between different nodes is defined as the weight as shown in fig 7 by analyzing the topological statistical characteristics of the constructed complex network the transition law between auv states can be accurately and effectively described 3 4 the feature extraction from the complex network in the normal condition the steady node is a a a and this node should have a high proportion when the auv is in an abnormal condition to better describe the auv state this paper divides the nodes into abnormal steady nodes and abnormal transient nodes among them the abnormal steady nodes include b b b c c c d d d and abnormal transient nodes are composed of other nodes such as b b c c c a d d b and so on it should be noted that the distinction between steady nodes and transient nodes only indicates different abnormal fluctuation patterns and is not affected by the proportion here this paper analyzes the laws of the three abnormal conditions of auv and the residual sequence of the abnormal conditions is shown in fig 8 abnormal condition 1 the fluctuation starts from a a a after a limited number of conversions it finally reaches an abnormal stable node with the disappearance of the abnormal interference the auv finally returns from the abnormally stable node to a a a abnormal condition 2 the fluctuation starts from a a a and reaches an abnormally stable node after a limited number of changes then it quickly returns to a a a this state is similar to abnormal condition 1 but the pattern is relatively simple abnormal condition 3 the pattern started from a a a and after a series of changes it finally remained in a specific abnormal fluctuation pattern subsequently based on the mentioned fluctuation laws we propose a feature extraction method based on complex network theory the extracted network features include the relative shortest path between abnormal steady nodes the strength coefficient of steady nodes and the self transition probability of steady nodes it should be noted that the details of several algorithms mentioned in this section can be referred to zou et al 2019 3 4 1 the relative shortest path in complex network theory the shortest path refers to the minimum number of edges connecting any two nodes so the shortest path is introduced to study the state transition between different nodes dijkstra s algorithm is usually employed for weighted complex networks to calculate the shortest path between two nodes the calculation formula is presented as follows 4 l i j m i n m n n m n w m n where n is the node set between nodes i and j w m n is the weight of the edge between nodes m and n and l i j is the shortest distance from node i to j to avoid the impact of different network structures this paper describes the characteristics of the network by defining the relative shortest path the calculation formula is as follows 5 r l i j i j m i j l i j a v r l where m is the steady node set under abnormal conditions and a v r l is the average shortest path length of the network 3 4 2 the strength coefficient node strength is a key indicator to measure the importance of nodes in a directed weighted network a node s strength can be expressed as the number of nodes adjacent to the node and the number of connections the node strength can be presented as 6 n s i j k w i j where n s i is the strength of node i k is the set of neighbor nodes of i and w i j is the weight of edge between i and j it should be noted that this paper considers the self loop of the node when solving the node strength to compare the strength of nodes under different networks more intuitively this paper defines the node s strength coefficient the calculation method is as follows 7 p n s i n s i j a n s j where a is the set of all nodes in the complex network 3 4 3 the self transition probability in a complex network a node s self transition probability is an important indicator to measure the stability of the node s fluctuation in a weighted directed network the transition probability of a node is defined as the ratio of the weight and the node strength as shown below 8 p r i j w i j n s i where w i j is the edge weight from node i to j and n s i is the strength of node i when i j the transition probability is converted to the self transition probability of node i 3 5 support vector machine support vector machine svm is a supervised learning algorithm which is widely applied in binary or multi classification problems besides even in the case of small samples svm with a kernel can still be introduced to classify complex and non linear targets svm is based on the concept of margin detection which separates two or more types of objects equally by constructing a hyperplane an appropriate boundary has the longest distance for the nearest object therefore svm is also called a large margin classifier the closest object is called the support vector and the hyperplane are usually defined by the kernel function as a common classifier svm is not described too much in this paper for detailed content please refer to jufri et al 2019 4 experimental results and discussion 4 1 accuracy verification of auv dynamic model this section discusses the accuracy of the obtained dynamic model the training performance is represented by mean square error m s e which is defined as follows 9 m s e 1 t i 1 t θ i θ t a r i 2 where t is the number of training times θ i is the output by the neural network and θ t a r i is the target pitch angle the transfer function is used to calculate the layers output from the network input the transfer function is defined as follows 10 f x 2 1 e 2 x 1 according to the levenberg marquardt optimization algorithm the bayesian regularization back propagation training method is used to update the weights and bias validation stops are disabled val fail 0 to continue training until the best combination of error and weight is determined tian et al 2018 fig 9 proposes a training performance of the nn the best m s e is 0 089865 in the 428 t h generation fig 10 shows the training state of the neural network this paper uses data sets under different sea conditions to verify the accuracy of the proposed model and compares it with the model identified by the ls method and the model obtained only by the nn as shown in fig 11 fig 11 illustrates the performance of the obtained three models under various sea conditions the black solid line is the measurement result of the ins the red solid line is the output of the model proposed in this paper the blue dashed line is the output of the nn model and the green dashed line is the output of the model obtained by the ls method the experimental results show that the model identified by the ls method has a large error between the output and the measurement in the diving stage whether the amplitude or the changing trend the output results from the proposed model and nn model are consistent with the measurement therefore to show the performance between them more directly the errors of the three models are shown in fig 12 and the average error and root mean square error rmse of the three models are shown in table 3 fig 12 shows the error between the output of the three models and the measurement it can be seen that for the ls model the maximum error occurs in the auv diving stage and the error amplitude exceeds 6 degrees furthermore the error is relatively small in the floating and fixed depth stage most of which are between 2 and 0 as shown in table 3 the average error of the ls model is 0 2577 and the rmse is 25 538 for the nn model and the proposed model most errors are in the range of 1 1 and a small part is in the range of 2 2 the accuracy of these two models is higher than that of the ls model it can be seen from table 3 the average error of the nn model is 0 1269 and the rmse is 0 2309 the average error of the model proposed in this paper is 0 0349 and its rmse is 0 1928 this shows that the estimation accuracy of the proposed model is higher than that of the nn model moreover compared with the nn model the proposed model has smaller error fluctuations therefore based on the above analysis we can conclude that the proposed model can more accurately estimate the change of the auv pitch angle compared with the other two models 4 2 discussion on feature extraction of complex networks as discussed before in part 3 section 4 the feature extraction of complex networks is an important part of the proposed method therefore we focus on the effectiveness of the extracted features for state classification in this section fig 13 shows the complex networks corresponding to the four conditions 4 2 1 the relative shortest path the average relative shortest paths of the four conditions are summarized in table 4 as discussed in section 4 1 compared with the measured pitch angles the model deviations are mostly in the range of 1 1 and the other few are in the range of 2 2 and the range of 3 3 the abnormal nodes would still appear even in normal condition however compared with other situations they appear less frequently table 4 presents that the average relative shortest path in normal condition is 10 59 which is smaller than the abnormal condition 1 and 2 19 44 and 12 57 respectively the relative shortest path of abnormal condition 3 is 0 which means that there are no connections between abnormal steady nodes the above results demonstrate that there is a clear difference between the four conditions it can be explained that using the relatively shortest path as the classification feature can effectively improve the accuracy 4 2 2 the strength coefficients fig 14 shows the average strength coefficients of the steady nodes in four conditions which are summarized in table 5 it can be seen that the strength coefficients are significantly different in the four conditions under normal condition a a a has a larger proportion in all nodes with an average of 0 745 however b b b c c c and d d d have lower proportions which are 0 063 0 051 and 0 014 respectively considering abnormal condition 1 the average strength coefficient of a a a is 0 1274 while c c c increases to 0 425 and b b b and d d d are 0 019 and 0 117 respectively for abnormal condition 2 the average strength coefficients of each steady node are between the normal condition and abnormal condition 1 that is the proportions of a a a and b b b are lower than the normal condition and higher than the abnormal condition 1 the nodes c c c and d d d are higher than the normal condition and lower than the abnormal condition 1 in abnormal condition 3 the strength coefficient of c c c exceeds 0 89 while the other steady nodes are 0 through the above analysis it can be explained that for different conditions the strength coefficients have obvious different patterns this feature also helps to identify and classify states 4 2 3 the self transition probability fig 15 shows the average self transition probability in the four conditions and the results are summarized in table 6 it can be seen from the definition that this feature is related to the stability of the nodes in the four conditions the self transition probability of a a a is 0 948 0 773 0 914 and 0 respectively for node b b b its stability is in the normal condition similar to abnormal condition 1 and 2 self transition probability is 0 353 0 287 and 0 353 respectively and it is quite different from abnormal condition 3 self transition probability is 0 the stability of c c c and d d d in the abnormal condition is significantly different from that in normal condition among them node c c c exhibits extremely high stability in abnormal condition 3 the probability of self transition is 0 991 obviously according to the above analysis the self transition probability can also effectively characterize the difference of networks in different conditions 4 2 4 the discussion for observed patterns the three characteristics used in this paper describe the auv conditions fluctuation law from different perspectives fig 8 shows the error of the three abnormal motion conditions due to the auv fluctuates drastically in abnormal condition 1 the transient nodes increase afterwards the conversion path between abnormal steady nodes becomes longer that is the shortest path between steady nodes grows considering that the number of nodes for constructing complex networks is fixed the growth of transient nodes would reduce the number of steady nodes moreover the auv is in an abnormal motion condition the number of a a a decreases and the abnormal steady nodes increase so the corresponding nodes strength coefficient changes as shown in fig 6 drastic fluctuations in the pitch angle result in more state transitions then from the definition of node self transition probability the stability of a a a decreases while the stability of abnormally steady nodes increases when the auv is in abnormal condition 2 see fig 8 b its state fluctuation is weaker than that in abnormal condition 1 but it is still higher than the normal condition therefore the corresponding shortest path length is between the abnormal condition 1 and the normal condition in this state normal nodes increase and abnormal nodes decrease in the network the corresponding node strength coefficient also changes in addition the auv fluctuates relatively smoothly and the corresponding normal nodes and abnormal steady nodes are relatively stable when the auv is in abnormal condition 3 it can be seen from fig 8 c that the fluctuation pattern of the auv does not change significantly all states only contain a certain abnormal steady node and the complex network formed is relatively simple therefore the shortest path length between abnormal steady nodes is 0 and the node strength coefficient and self transition probability are relatively large 4 3 comparison of various monitoring methods this paper compares the classical time frequency analysis method and the artificial intelligence method to verify the performance of the proposed method model cn svm among them the classic time frequency analysis method applies wavelet packet transform wpt and svm lu et al 2019 and the artificial intelligence method uses 1 d cnn kao et al 2018 the computer configuration employed to verify the method is intel r core tm i7 7500u cpu 2 7 ghz and the memory is 8gb in this paper the networkx library is introduced to build complex networks and extract features the pytorch library is used to construct the 1 d cnn network and the svm is implemented through libsvm and 576 samples are collected including normal condition abnormal condition 1 2 and 3 each sample contains 300 data points of which 350 data samples are used in the training set 100 samples are used in the validation set and 126 samples are used in the testing set the experimental results are summarized in fig 16 it can be seen that wpt svm has achieved great detection results for normal condition and abnormal condition 3 and its accuracy is 0 727 and 0 929 respectively however the accuracy of abnormal condition 2 and 3 is only 0 357 and 0 538 which means the method is invalid for them for the normal condition and abnormal condition 3 the accuracy of 1 d cnn is 0 946 and 0 99 compared with the wpt svm method its accuracy has improved by 23 2 and 7 1 respectively unfortunately the accuracy of this method for abnormal condition 1 and 2 is only 0 45 and 0 588 although the performance is improved compared with wpt svm by 16 7 and 8 5 respectively its accuracy is still around 0 5 which also means that this method cannot distinguish abnormal conditions 1 and 2 well in fact compared with the mentioned two methods the proposed method shows significantly performance for the normal condition model cn svm reaches 0 872 which improves the performance by 16 6 compared with wpt svm but the accuracy drops by 7 8 compared with 1 d cnn however it should be noticed that model cn svm can accurately identify abnormal condition 1 with an accuracy of 0 886 compared with the other two methods wpt svm and 1 d cnn the accuracy is improved by 57 7 and 49 2 respectively for abnormal condition 2 the accuracy of model cn svm is 0 875 which is an improvement compared with the other two methods with an increase of 38 5 and 32 8 respectively for abnormal condition 3 the accuracy of the proposed method is 0 99 which is the same as the 1 d cnn and slightly higher than the wpt svm in summary the proposed method can effectively identify and distinguish the above four conditions and achieve high accuracy the proposed method is more suitable for our self developed auv than the other two methods the software system of sailfish 324 uses moos ivp to ensure the real time of auv the maximum frequency of sensor data transmission should be lower than 10 hz for the wpt method it is not easy to extract effective feature information when processing low frequency signals for deep learning methods the classification accuracy depends on the data sets and the data sets used in this paper are all from ocean trials in fact it is difficult to obtain a large amount of abnormal data during the sea trials therefore under the premise of insufficient data sets 1 d cnn cannot achieve high classification accuracy the proposed method converts the motion states of the auv into a complex network for analysis this method uses a sliding window to process time series defines the state in a small time scale as a node builds a complex network through the state transition relations extracts topological feature parameters and characterizes the auv s motion state law for this reason compared with wpt and 1 d cnn it is more suitable for feature extraction and analysis of low frequency and small sample data 5 conclusion this paper presents an auv abnormal motion condition monitoring method which is composed of the dynamic model complex network theory and svm among them the dynamic model is employed to estimate the pitch angle of the auv in the normal motion condition the complex network theory is applied to extract the characteristics of the different conditions and the svm is used to monitor and distinguish the abnormal motion conditions of the auv the accuracy of the proposed method is improved by considering the auv states the fluctuation laws and the feature extractions by dividing the abnormal nodes into abnormal steady nodes and abnormal transient nodes the state fluctuation in different conditions can be described more clearly and accurately subsequently the auv conditions are analyzed according to different fluctuation patterns and its fluctuation laws are proposed finally based on the proposed fluctuation laws the complex network theory is introduced to extract the characteristics of auv the results demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately identify the normal and abnormal conditions and can accurately classify the abnormal motion conditions therefore the proposed monitoring method can be effectively applied to auv motion status monitoring declaration of competing

20317,the multiple functions of large scale surface warship systems involve the main system subsystems and important components with complex logical relationships and some components require a number of redundant components to maintain their high reliability moreover the information about the ship structure system and equipments cannot be fully determined in practical naval battlefield especially locations of some key components therefore it is difficult to accurately perform damage assessment of large scale surface warships using traditional fault tree models monte carlo simulation mcs is the most robust method for damage assessment but it is computationally demanding to address the issue a new method with high efficiency and accuracy is proposed herein in the proposed method a dynamic damage tree dldt model is developed to describing complex ship systems with redundant and uncertain information and the multilevel monte carlo mlmc simulation is modified to reduce the computational cost of mcs the modified mlmc is capable of obtaining the damage probabilities of various components subsystems and top events for different numbers of anti ship weapons results of numerical validation demonstrate that the computational cost of the proposed mlmc is much less than that of mcs while achieving the same accuracy level by combining dldt and mlmc the proposed method provides a reference for efficiently and accurately assessing the functional damage to large scale surface warships keywords damage assessment large scale surface warships dynamic coordinate damage tree multilevel monte carlo 1 introduction in 1942 during the battle of midway island a bomb created a 12 foot hole in the flight deck of the uss yorktown cv 5 causing three aircraft on the hangar deck to catch fire however damage control members repaired the hole in only 25 min and quickly put out the fire the japanese navy continued to attack for three days and finally sank the ship u s hydrographic office 2014 based on experiences of this kind the navies of various countries have found that the combat time can be greatly shortened if an attack mission is performed after a warship battle damage assessment therefore rapid and precise damage assessments of target large scale surface warships are becoming increasingly important in naval battles in the damage assessment of warships there are a number of specifically designed software tools that can be used to probabilistically quantify the residual operational capability or survivability of a warship after being attacked by missiles e g prevent heywood and lear 2006 motiss morrisseau and sajdak 2008 cvam skeen and buckland 2010 and surma holmberg and kotiranta 2012 most of tools presently available define the functional dependencies among ship systems subsystems and components with the use of fault trees and then identify complex fault relationships from the early design of ships friebe et al 2019 goodrum et al 2018 however when evaluating the damage to large and complex enemy ship systems it is not easy to obtain precise failure data due to the scarcity of statistical data ambiguous component behaviours and the complex operating environments of the relevant systems the traditional fault tree has proven ineffective in solving problems for which precise data are not available such as the existence of spare components with uncertain locations in a system kabir 2017 this paper assumes that the components are nonrepairable which means that the probability density function of component damage is related to the component coordinates missile hit point distribution and damage threshold and is free of time accordingly the dynamic fault tree dft model of time dependent failure behaviour cannot be used for damage assessment boudali et al 2009 therefore we establish a dynamic location damage tree dldt model to describe the damage to a large scale surface ship system with redundant components and uncertain component locations based on the functional characteristics of location fault trees park et al 2003 aksu 2019 and spare gates in the quantitative analysis of dynamic trees dts the existing methods can be classified into three categories analytical based methods dong et al 2007 long et al 2000 state space based methods jansen et al 2019 bobbio and raiteri 2004 boudali and dugan 2005 and simulation based methods zio 2013 faulin et al 2010 in the most cases such as minimal cut sequence set mcss minimal extended cut sequences set mecss and the structure function the analytical method is performed using the inclusion exclusion equation yuge and yanagi 2008 merle et al 2014 the state space method is a method of transforming dfts into an equivalent markov chain and quantifying it based on exponential distribution of failure behaviour of components dugan et al 1992 boudali et al 2007 the computational costs of the analytical method and the state space method increases exponentially with the complexity of the system because of space explosion the simulation method is to randomly sample each basic event in the dft according to their failure distribution and propagate the failures upwards in the dft gates durga rao et al 2009 monte carlo simulation mcs can be applied for any type of failure distribution to quantitatively analyse dts regardless of the dimension in addition the probabilities of the top event and intermediate events can be obtained gascard and simeu abazi 2018 however the total number of random simulations dramatically increases with the accuracy requirement leading to the sharp increase of computational cost considering the complexity of a large scale surface warship system if the components are refined based on the equipment crude mcs will be quite computationally demanding to enhance the calculation efficiency the dldt model is quantified based on a multilevel monte carlo mlmc by comparing with mcs it is concluded that the mlmc approach can achieve a sufficient accuracy and reduce the computational cost the remainder of the paper is organized as follows the damage assessment process for ship systems based on dldt and mlmc is introduced in section 2 the and and spare gate functions in dldt are modified and the probability density functions pdfs of spare components with unknown coordinates are obtained through the hazard function in section 3 section 4 compares mcs with mlmc and modifies the original mlmc for quantitative analyses of dldts we take the aviation support system of an aircraft carrier as a case to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in section 5 finally section 6 presents some conclusions and discuss future work 2 damage assessment process fig 1 illustrates the damage assessment process for large scale surface warships mainly including establishing the dldt assessment model setting initial parameters using the mlmc algorithm to quantify the dldt and outputting the damage probability 1 first the location damage tree ldt model is established based on the basic information for evaluation objects including the compositions and operational processes of systems the logical relationships among damage events and the coordinates and location characteristics of important components 2 modify the and and spare gates of the ldt model and establish the dldt model by obtaining the pdf and cdf of the spare components with unknown coordinates 3 based on the evaluation purpose and the basic information for the target warship system set the initial parameters including the coordinates damage threshold of components and number and distribution of anti ship missiles 4 solve the dldt model using mlmc although methods such as mcs can be used to quantify dldt their computational efficiency is low for complex systems on large ships mlmc can achieve sufficient accuracy greatly reduce the computational costs and output the damage probability of each important component key subsystem minimum cut set and top event 3 modification of logic gates in dft model the pdf of an event to occur is a function to time as time goes on all components are probable to fail in contrast whether or not a component is damaged after an attack relies on its coordinates and the coverage area of the attack the probability that the subsystem having a number of redundant components is damaged by a single attack may be zero 3 1 and gate in the dldt model of large scale surface ships we define component damage as a basic event be if all bes occur at the and gate the and gate output is true in the dft model of a ship the failure of a component or the occurrence of a be is caused by internal factors and pdfs of all bes are functions of time the probability that the output of an and gate is true is larger than zero however component damage in the dldt model is mainly caused by external factors under the condition that the number of external damages is very limited the output of an and gate may be for sure false as shown in fig 2 the output of the and gate is true if all the four aircraft elevators a el are damaged which represents the damage of the transportation system of the aircraft carrier considering that the elevators are distributed around the flight deck it is impossible that one missile damages all elevators at the same time therefore the probability that the and gate outputs true is zero thus it is necessary to consider the effects of the number of weapons damage threshold and the distribution of components to assess gate output events in practice to illustrate how to determine whether a component is damaged the and gate of three components shown in fig 3 is used as an example it is assumed that the component is damaged if the missile falls within the damage threshold r on the right side of fig 3 the three components a b and c do not form an intersection only when the number of missiles is 3 can all components be damaged similarly when components ab or abc form an intersection two or one missile is needed to damage all components respectively and the probability of the and gate output being true is larger than 0 therefore the uncertainties of missile s hit point and coordinates of components and the number of missiles within the damage threshold must be considered in calculating the probability of be occurrence and the output of and gate the or gate in dlft and dft is also different which is similar to that of the and gate so it is unnecessary to illustrate again 3 2 spare gate 3 2 1 modification of the spare gate this section introduces the spare gate in dft model to dldt model in order to describe the redundancy in large scale surface warship system as shown in fig 4 in dft the spare gate has one primary component that is initially active and one alternate component the spare that is initially in a dormant state if the primary component fails the spare component is activated and replaces the primary component the spare gate outputs true when the primary and alternate components fail based on the value of the dormancy factor α the spare gate has three variants or temperatures david et al 2000 cold csp warm wsp and hot hsp the hazard rate of a dormant spare component is equal to the product of its corresponding primary and the dormancy factor α 0 for a csp gate α 0 the hazard rate of a spare component is zero the spare component never fails before its activation for a hsp gate α 1 the hazard rate of a spare component is the same with that of its corresponding primary component the wsp state 0 α 1 is a compromise between csp and hsp conditions relative to the primary component the hazard rate of a dormant spare component is reduced by the dormancy factor α compared with dft under external active attack the dormant state of spare component does not affect its hazard rate as long as the missile falls within the damage threshold of the spare component damage will occur therefore there exist two conditions 1 when the coordinates of the spare component are known the damaged pdf is consistent with other components and relies on the missile hit point distribution in this case the spare gate needs to be modified to an and gate as shown in fig 5 2 when the working coordinates of a spare component are known but the spatial position in the non working state are uncertain the hazard rate of the spare component is determined by the position influence factor β where β 0 1 taking the spare component manually operated visual landing aid system movlas of the landing assist system in fig 2 as an example movlas whose damage threshold range is denoted by the dotted line is spare component for radar assist system and improved fresnel lens optical landing system iflols β 1 indicates that movlas is located at a certain position in the system space and β 0 1 indicates the distance between movlas and working coordinates of the space after obtaining the pdf of damage to spare components at the undetermined location we can convert the dynamic coordinate tree into a static tree and quantify it the method used to obtain the pdf of damage to spare component is elaborated in the next section 3 2 2 hazard rate function z x in the us military standard mil hdbk 338 the hazard function is related to time t and is expressed as the probability of failure occurring at time t but not before time t mil hdbk 338 1984 according to this definition the hazard function can be applied in situations in which component damage is related to space coordinates notably damage is expressed as the conditional probability that there is no damage at other locations but damage occurs within the component damage threshold the evaluated system space is defined as a horizontally two dimensional space constructed in the x direction and y direction and all components are distributed in this space the pdf of damage to spare component in different states will be discussed based on the coordinate x the coordinate x is a random variable in a differentiable distribution function considering the active damage behaviour f x is the pdf of damage occurring at any x and defined as the derivative of the distribution function f x 1 f x f x d f x d x when the component coordinate interval x 0 δ x 0 2 x 0 δ x 0 2 and a cell δ x around it are sufficiently small relative to the whole system space the coordinate interval δ x and the coordinate x 0 have the same pdf and changes in f x in the interval δ x are negligible then the probability of damage in the interval can be approximately expressed as 2 p r x δ x f x 0 δ x thus if no damage occurs at other spatial coordinates and damage is limited to δ x then 2 can be rewritten as 3 p r x δ x p r γ p r x δ x γ where γ indicates that when a missile does not land in the interval x 0 δ x 0 2 x 0 δ x 0 2 δ x will not be damaged p r x δ x γ is the conditional probability of a damage event in the interval δ x which can be written as the product of the hazard rate function z x and the interval length δ x dubi 1998 4 p r x δ x γ z x δ x due to the one dimensional nature of time it is linearly forward and irreversible the occurrence of a failure event at a certain moment indicates that the state was normal until that moment however the damage is related to the space coordinate which means that no damage to other coordinates occurs based on the damage threshold as shown in fig 6 accordingly 5 p r γ 1 f x 0 1 f x 0 δ x 0 2 f x 0 δ x 0 2 then eq 3 can be expressed as follows 6 p r x δ x 1 f x 0 δ x 0 2 f x 0 δ x 0 2 z x δ x combining eqs 2 and 6 we have 7 z x f x 1 f x 0 δ x 0 2 f x 0 δ x 0 2 where f x 0 δ x 0 2 f x 0 δ x 0 2 x 0 δ x 0 2 x 0 δ x 0 2 f x since this value is controlled by the component interval range it is set to a constant c then 7 becomes 8 z x f x 1 c 3 2 3 pdf and cdf of spare component b assuming that a is the primary component of the spare gate and b is the spare component if b is damaged before a dormant state the hazard rate function z x is determined by the position influence factor β if b is damaged after a the hazard rate function z x remains unchanged because of the order relation a unit step is defined boudali and dugan 2006 2008 9 u b a 0 if b a 1 if b a where b and a are nonnegative real numbers if b a then b is damaged first otherwise a is damaged first then the conditional hazard function of b is 10 z x b x a u a b β z b x u b a z b x assuming that the pdf and cdf of the missile hit point distribution are f x and f x respectively the pdf of the damage to b after being activated is f b x f x thus this information can be combined with eq 8 to obtain f b x 1 c z b x moreover the conditional pdf of b is 11 f x b x a 1 c z x b x a 1 c u a b β z b x u b a z b x according to eq 9 when b is in active mode and damaged b a u a b 0 and u b a 1 when b is in a dormant damage state and then damaged b a u a b 1 and u b a 0 thus eq 11 becomes 12 f x b x a f b x if a b β f b x if a b the conditional cdf is 13 f x b x a f b x if a b β f b x if a b taking the normal distribution of f x as an example the damage cdf of b and other normal components in the x direction are shown in fig 7 4 multilevel monte carlo mlmc algorithm 4 1 mcs in this paper the process of using mcs to quantify dldt is 1 sampling n random samples according to the component failure distribution function 2 determining whether the sample falls within the component damage threshold 3 counting the number of the minimum cut sets that occur the ratio of this value to the total number of samplings is the failure probability of the top event it is assumed that the dldt has n minimum cut sets and the number of minimum cut sets occurring in the i th random simulation is denoted by m i thus the top event of the dldt occurs if m i 0 according to the theory of mcs the estimator of the probability of the top event has the following expression 14 s ˆ 1 n i 1 n i m i where i m i is an indicator function i m i 1 if m i 0 and i m i 0 otherwise s ˆ is the top event damage probability n is the number of sampling the variance of the estimator s ˆ is 15 v s ˆ 1 n s s 2 e s v s n where s s 2 is the second moment of s since s ˆ is unbiased only the variance of the estimator needs to be considered in the decomposition of the mean squared error 16 e s ˆ e s 2 e s ˆ e s ˆ e s ˆ e s 2 e s ˆ e s 2 e s ˆ e s ˆ 2 according to central limit theorem the cost of mcs is 17 c o s t m c v s ɛ 2 c where c is the number of minimum cut sets in the system that is the overall computational cost of mcs depends on three factors the variance of the estimator accuracy and the number of minimum cut sets according to eqs 14 and 17 mcs needs to indiscriminately calculate all the minimum cut sets in each random simulation even though some of them may contribute little to s ˆ which is not computationally economical in order to reduce the overall computational cost of estimating s ˆ while maintaining the accuracy level of results section 4 2 modifies mlmc and allocates more calculation resource to the minimum cut sets that contribute more to s ˆ 4 2 mlmc algorithm the idea of mlmc is to quantitatively allocate computational resource according to how much a minimum cut set contributes to s ˆ no computational resources is allocated to the minimum cut set whose contribution is negligible relative to the accuracy requirement or convergence threshold in the quantization of the dldt model to enhance the overall computational performance we take the sequence s 0 s 1 s l as the estimation sequence in the minimum cut set nested sequence c 0 c 1 c l c representing the set of minimum cut sets by linearity of expectation we have 18 e s l e s 0 l 0 l e s l s l 1 and the unbiased estimator of e s l can be expressed as 19 1 n 0 n 1 n 0 s 0 0 n l 1 l 1 n l n 1 n l s l l n s l 1 l n where n l is the number of samples in level l and the superscript l n indicates that the samples used at each level of correction are independent let v 0 and c 0 be the variance and expected cost of one sample of s 0 respectively and let v l and c l be the variance and expected cost of one sample of s l s l 1 in this case the overall expected cost and variance of multilevel estimators are l 0 l n l c o s t l and l 0 l n l 1 v l respectively with the increase of level l if the increase in computational cost grows slower than the decrease in the variance of v l c o s t l we can achieve significant computational savings giles 2008 according to the definition of the number of cut sets in reference aslett et al 2017 the uncertainty of l in operations is not considered thus we prespecify that level l contains c l 2 l minimum cut sets to make v y l decay faster than c l increases the possibility of terminating the algorithm early is considered we make the contribution from each level as large as possible at the smallest levels so that these contributions rapidly decay with increasing level and the convergence conditions are met as soon as possible to achieve this we perform experimental monte carlo simulations of the system to obtain the estimator of the minimum cut set and the overall estimator s ˆ t e s t then the minimum cut sets are sorted and the sorting principle is to maximize the difference between the estimators produced by the minimum cut set of l and l 1 20 e s l s l 1 max in other words choose 21 c l arg max e s l s l 1 c l c s t c l 1 c l according to theorem 1 ii giles 2008 if there is an independent estimator y l based on n l monte carlo samples then 22 e y l e s 0 l 0 e s l s l 1 l 0 in this case a positive constant exists such that for any ɛ e 1 there are values l and n l for which the multilevel estimator is y l 0 l y l thus eq 18 can be expressed as 23 e s l e s 0 l 1 l e s l s l 1 l 0 l e y l as described above we independently estimate each term 24 e y l 1 n l j 1 n l s l j s l 1 j we choose c l the minimum number of cut sets of l as the upper bound of the cost in each stage therefore the overall expected cost and variance of multilevel estimates are 25 c o s t m l m c l 0 l n l c l 26 v l 0 l y l 1 n l l 0 l v y l for a fixed variance the cost can be minimized by selecting n l μ v y l c giles 2015 and the lagrangian multiplier is μ ɛ 2 l 0 l v y l c then the overall expected cost is 27 c o s t m l m c ɛ 2 l 0 l v y l c l 2 compared to the computational cost of mcs in eq 17 if the appropriate approximation values s l and s l 1 are choosed we can make v y l decrease faster than c l increases in this case v y l c l decreases gradually which will reduce computational costs and if we stop the algorithm ahead of time instead of performing calculations at all levels of y based on the convergence condition the cost will be further reduced 4 3 process of the mlmc algorithm one of the key features of the mlmc algorithm is its ability to naturally provide stopping criteria to optimally select the number of levels l ˆ to actually simulate according to theorem 1 giles 2008 as l asymptotically 28 e s ˆ l s ˆ l 1 e s l s ˆ l therefore we have 29 e y l e s l s ˆ l ɛ 2 thus the natural stopping criterion involves selecting the smallest l ˆ such that y l ˆ ɛ 2 the concept of algorithm termination involves selecting some main minimum cut sets for calculations and ignoring the remaining minimum cut set with the lowest probability i e when the convergence condition is satisfied we do not perform calculations for all minimum cut sets but stop the algorithm in advance which will reduce computational costs although the neglected probability of minimum cut sets may be small it will still affect the outcome for a top event after accumulation consequently we introduce the second convergence condition and the contribution of the estimator needs to be considered 30 e s ˆ l s ˆ t e s t α ɛ α 0 1 when the first convergence condition is satisfied but the contribution condition is not satisfied we increase the number of cut sets to satisfy the second convergence condition c l ˆ 2 l ˆ 1 c where c is the number that needs to be increased so that c l ˆ satisfies the following relation 31 c l ˆ arg e s ˆ l s ˆ t e s t α ɛ based on the above theoretical analysis the calculation process of the mlmc algorithm is shown in fig 8 5 warship case study 5 1 establishing a dldt model of aviation support systems in a marine battlefield scenario the main role of aircraft carriers is to control the air and sea in the naval battle zone based on a carrier based aircraft formation if an aircraft carrier loses its ability to guarantee the operation of carrier based aircraft air dominance will be lost therefore in conjunction with the core operational functions of aircraft carriers we take the aircraft carrier s aviation support system as the damage assessment object the aviation support system of an aircraft carrier is mainly composed of transportation ammunition supply aircraft launching and aircraft landing subsystems ignoring minimal probability damage events this paper divides the aviation support system into only four subsystems and several important components additionally combined with the operation process of the aviation support system in fig 9 we establish the dldt model in which the top event is the damage of the aircraft carrier aviation support system and an intermediate event is the damage of the carrier aircraft transportation ammunition supply launching or landing system as shown in fig 10 the transportation and ammunition supply system mainly includes four aircraft elevators and three weapon elevators the aircraft launching system consists of four catapults and the aircraft landing system includes an aiding and arresting system the probability of the missile hit is affected by ship susceptibility evasive motion and ship dynamic instability under severe sea conditions ball and calvano 2009 france et al 2003 somayajula et al 2019 kim et al 2014 it is difficult to obtain its explicit expression thus the pdf corresponding to the missile hit point is generally obtained through statistical methods in the ship survivability analysis programme motiss taking the centre point of the ship deck as the origin the pdf of the missile hit point is defined based on normal distributions in the ship length directions chung and kwon 2008 however considering that the width of the flight deck of an aircraft carrier is much larger than that of a general ship the distributions of hit points in the length and width directions are normal distributions of n 0 60 and n 0 15 respectively based on public information we can obtain the spatial distribution of components as shown in fig 11 and determine the coordinate range of each component to input into the mlmc algorithm in addition based on the given missile hit point distribution and damage threshold we can use the mlmc algorithm to solve the dldt model 5 2 analysis of results based on the damage probability results for all components and component coordinates we build a contour map of the damage probability for the ship s length and width associated with an external attack as shown in fig 12 the theoretical results indicate that the damage probability of the components gradually decreases from the centre of the hull to the surrounding area which is consistent with the distribution of the missile hit points in the length and width directions the mlmc algorithm is used to solve the dldt model and the relationship between the damage probabilities of components and the number of weapons is obtained for cases with multiple anti ship weapons figs 13 and 14 show the damage probabilities of 22 key components with 1 4 weapons and 5 8 weapons shown in different colours from the inside to the outside circles the red line at the end of the ribbon corresponds to the outermost scale value which indicates the probability value the inner circle indicates that the systems to which the 22 key components belong are the ts transportation system ass ammunition supply system ais aiding system ars arresting system and als aircraft launching system the damage probabilities of these 5 subsystems are shown in fig 15 similarly the circles from the inside to the outside represent the damage probabilities of the 5 subsystems for 1 8 weapons because nos 20 22 are far from the centre of the hull and no 22 is a spare part with an unknown coordinate position the damage probabilities of the three components in figs 13 15 are small and do not change significantly as the number of anti ship weapons increases moreover the damage probability of the ais is close to 0 the ts and ass contain numerous parallel components when the number of missiles is less than 4 and 7 respectively the damage probabilities of the ts and ass are close to 0 thus the probability of that the systems are negligible finally we can obtain the damage probability for aviation support system as summarized in table 1 the damage probabilities of the key components and subsystems mentioned above provide a reference for formulating a battle plan 5 3 result verification under the same conditions two weapons we use mcs to verify the accuracy of the mlmc algorithm additionally to ensure the reliability of the verification results we exponentially increase the number of mcs samples and obtain subsequent solutions the true value of top event probability is 0 238202 the top event probabilities obtained with the mcs and mlmc algorithms are 0 238506 and 0 238127 respectively moreover the corresponding errors are 1 27e 3 and 3 15e 4 these findings suggest that mlmc algorithm meets the calculation accuracy requirements of the studied scenario and the computational cost is approximately 71 of mcs in terms of reducing cost we combine the output results for the minimum cut set for illustration fig 16 shows that at a fixed damage threshold when the number of anti ship weapons is decreased the probability of obtaining a partial minimum cut set is low or even 0 with an increase in the number of anti ship weapons the probability of cut sets 4 14 increases significantly and the remaining cut sets do not obviously change when using the mlmc algorithm to solve the dldt model the objective of reducing costs involves ignoring cut sets with low damage probabilities which reduces the overall cost to verify the stability of the mlmc approach in obtaining cost savings under different conditions we change the calculation accuracy requirements and perform multiple simulations the computational costs of the mlmc algorithm is significantly less than that of mcs under different precision requirements as shown in fig 17 in summary the mlmc algorithm can reduce the overall computational cost under the premise of ensuring accuracy however since only the damage to subsystems and equipment is considered in this case the damage results are not refined to the part level if the part level was considered the number of minimum cut sets would increase exponentially and many cut sets with low damage probabilities would be ignored consequently the cost saving advantage of the mlmc algorithm would be more obvious in such situations 6 conclusions and recommendations this paper develops a method to evaluate system functional damage to large scale surface warships after being attacked the method consists of two parts the dldt model and mlmc the former is used to describe the logical relationships among ship system functions and the latter provide efficient and accurate predictions based on component damage consequences the dldt model is a damage tree with system location attributes and after modifying its logic gates we distinguish the damage attributes expressed by the dldt model from the failure attributes of reliability analysis and then calculate the pdf and cdf of the damage to spare components when the coordinates are unknown based on the hazard function thus the dldt model can describe complex ship systems with incomplete information regarding the locations of spare parts in the quantification of the dldt model the mlmc algorithm which can reduce the computational cost is adopted mcs is used to verify that the mlmc algorithm can reduce the computational cost and meet the accuracy requirements of practical scenarios additionally the greater the number of minimum cut sets is the more significant the cost saving effect through a case study the mlmc algorithm can output the damage probability of top events subsystems components and minimum cut sets considering different numbers of weapons this approach significantly contributes to the efficient and accurate damage assessment to large scale surface warships in damage assessment the probability of ship system damage is related to not only the spatial distribution of anti ship weapons and component coordinates but also to the relevant damage thresholds therefore in the process of dldt quantification it is necessary to perform vulnerability analyses of ship structures through experiments and simulations to determine the damage thresholds of components these tasks will be considered in future studies credit

20317,the multiple functions of large scale surface warship systems involve the main system subsystems and important components with complex logical relationships and some components require a number of redundant components to maintain their high reliability moreover the information about the ship structure system and equipments cannot be fully determined in practical naval battlefield especially locations of some key components therefore it is difficult to accurately perform damage assessment of large scale surface warships using traditional fault tree models monte carlo simulation mcs is the most robust method for damage assessment but it is computationally demanding to address the issue a new method with high efficiency and accuracy is proposed herein in the proposed method a dynamic damage tree dldt model is developed to describing complex ship systems with redundant and uncertain information and the multilevel monte carlo mlmc simulation is modified to reduce the computational cost of mcs the modified mlmc is capable of obtaining the damage probabilities of various components subsystems and top events for different numbers of anti ship weapons results of numerical validation demonstrate that the computational cost of the proposed mlmc is much less than that of mcs while achieving the same accuracy level by combining dldt and mlmc the proposed method provides a reference for efficiently and accurately assessing the functional damage to large scale surface warships keywords damage assessment large scale surface warships dynamic coordinate damage tree multilevel monte carlo 1 introduction in 1942 during the battle of midway island a bomb created a 12 foot hole in the flight deck of the uss yorktown cv 5 causing three aircraft on the hangar deck to catch fire however damage control members repaired the hole in only 25 min and quickly put out the fire the japanese navy continued to attack for three days and finally sank the ship u s hydrographic office 2014 based on experiences of this kind the navies of various countries have found that the combat time can be greatly shortened if an attack mission is performed after a warship battle damage assessment therefore rapid and precise damage assessments of target large scale surface warships are becoming increasingly important in naval battles in the damage assessment of warships there are a number of specifically designed software tools that can be used to probabilistically quantify the residual operational capability or survivability of a warship after being attacked by missiles e g prevent heywood and lear 2006 motiss morrisseau and sajdak 2008 cvam skeen and buckland 2010 and surma holmberg and kotiranta 2012 most of tools presently available define the functional dependencies among ship systems subsystems and components with the use of fault trees and then identify complex fault relationships from the early design of ships friebe et al 2019 goodrum et al 2018 however when evaluating the damage to large and complex enemy ship systems it is not easy to obtain precise failure data due to the scarcity of statistical data ambiguous component behaviours and the complex operating environments of the relevant systems the traditional fault tree has proven ineffective in solving problems for which precise data are not available such as the existence of spare components with uncertain locations in a system kabir 2017 this paper assumes that the components are nonrepairable which means that the probability density function of component damage is related to the component coordinates missile hit point distribution and damage threshold and is free of time accordingly the dynamic fault tree dft model of time dependent failure behaviour cannot be used for damage assessment boudali et al 2009 therefore we establish a dynamic location damage tree dldt model to describe the damage to a large scale surface ship system with redundant components and uncertain component locations based on the functional characteristics of location fault trees park et al 2003 aksu 2019 and spare gates in the quantitative analysis of dynamic trees dts the existing methods can be classified into three categories analytical based methods dong et al 2007 long et al 2000 state space based methods jansen et al 2019 bobbio and raiteri 2004 boudali and dugan 2005 and simulation based methods zio 2013 faulin et al 2010 in the most cases such as minimal cut sequence set mcss minimal extended cut sequences set mecss and the structure function the analytical method is performed using the inclusion exclusion equation yuge and yanagi 2008 merle et al 2014 the state space method is a method of transforming dfts into an equivalent markov chain and quantifying it based on exponential distribution of failure behaviour of components dugan et al 1992 boudali et al 2007 the computational costs of the analytical method and the state space method increases exponentially with the complexity of the system because of space explosion the simulation method is to randomly sample each basic event in the dft according to their failure distribution and propagate the failures upwards in the dft gates durga rao et al 2009 monte carlo simulation mcs can be applied for any type of failure distribution to quantitatively analyse dts regardless of the dimension in addition the probabilities of the top event and intermediate events can be obtained gascard and simeu abazi 2018 however the total number of random simulations dramatically increases with the accuracy requirement leading to the sharp increase of computational cost considering the complexity of a large scale surface warship system if the components are refined based on the equipment crude mcs will be quite computationally demanding to enhance the calculation efficiency the dldt model is quantified based on a multilevel monte carlo mlmc by comparing with mcs it is concluded that the mlmc approach can achieve a sufficient accuracy and reduce the computational cost the remainder of the paper is organized as follows the damage assessment process for ship systems based on dldt and mlmc is introduced in section 2 the and and spare gate functions in dldt are modified and the probability density functions pdfs of spare components with unknown coordinates are obtained through the hazard function in section 3 section 4 compares mcs with mlmc and modifies the original mlmc for quantitative analyses of dldts we take the aviation support system of an aircraft carrier as a case to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in section 5 finally section 6 presents some conclusions and discuss future work 2 damage assessment process fig 1 illustrates the damage assessment process for large scale surface warships mainly including establishing the dldt assessment model setting initial parameters using the mlmc algorithm to quantify the dldt and outputting the damage probability 1 first the location damage tree ldt model is established based on the basic information for evaluation objects including the compositions and operational processes of systems the logical relationships among damage events and the coordinates and location characteristics of important components 2 modify the and and spare gates of the ldt model and establish the dldt model by obtaining the pdf and cdf of the spare components with unknown coordinates 3 based on the evaluation purpose and the basic information for the target warship system set the initial parameters including the coordinates damage threshold of components and number and distribution of anti ship missiles 4 solve the dldt model using mlmc although methods such as mcs can be used to quantify dldt their computational efficiency is low for complex systems on large ships mlmc can achieve sufficient accuracy greatly reduce the computational costs and output the damage probability of each important component key subsystem minimum cut set and top event 3 modification of logic gates in dft model the pdf of an event to occur is a function to time as time goes on all components are probable to fail in contrast whether or not a component is damaged after an attack relies on its coordinates and the coverage area of the attack the probability that the subsystem having a number of redundant components is damaged by a single attack may be zero 3 1 and gate in the dldt model of large scale surface ships we define component damage as a basic event be if all bes occur at the and gate the and gate output is true in the dft model of a ship the failure of a component or the occurrence of a be is caused by internal factors and pdfs of all bes are functions of time the probability that the output of an and gate is true is larger than zero however component damage in the dldt model is mainly caused by external factors under the condition that the number of external damages is very limited the output of an and gate may be for sure false as shown in fig 2 the output of the and gate is true if all the four aircraft elevators a el are damaged which represents the damage of the transportation system of the aircraft carrier considering that the elevators are distributed around the flight deck it is impossible that one missile damages all elevators at the same time therefore the probability that the and gate outputs true is zero thus it is necessary to consider the effects of the number of weapons damage threshold and the distribution of components to assess gate output events in practice to illustrate how to determine whether a component is damaged the and gate of three components shown in fig 3 is used as an example it is assumed that the component is damaged if the missile falls within the damage threshold r on the right side of fig 3 the three components a b and c do not form an intersection only when the number of missiles is 3 can all components be damaged similarly when components ab or abc form an intersection two or one missile is needed to damage all components respectively and the probability of the and gate output being true is larger than 0 therefore the uncertainties of missile s hit point and coordinates of components and the number of missiles within the damage threshold must be considered in calculating the probability of be occurrence and the output of and gate the or gate in dlft and dft is also different which is similar to that of the and gate so it is unnecessary to illustrate again 3 2 spare gate 3 2 1 modification of the spare gate this section introduces the spare gate in dft model to dldt model in order to describe the redundancy in large scale surface warship system as shown in fig 4 in dft the spare gate has one primary component that is initially active and one alternate component the spare that is initially in a dormant state if the primary component fails the spare component is activated and replaces the primary component the spare gate outputs true when the primary and alternate components fail based on the value of the dormancy factor α the spare gate has three variants or temperatures david et al 2000 cold csp warm wsp and hot hsp the hazard rate of a dormant spare component is equal to the product of its corresponding primary and the dormancy factor α 0 for a csp gate α 0 the hazard rate of a spare component is zero the spare component never fails before its activation for a hsp gate α 1 the hazard rate of a spare component is the same with that of its corresponding primary component the wsp state 0 α 1 is a compromise between csp and hsp conditions relative to the primary component the hazard rate of a dormant spare component is reduced by the dormancy factor α compared with dft under external active attack the dormant state of spare component does not affect its hazard rate as long as the missile falls within the damage threshold of the spare component damage will occur therefore there exist two conditions 1 when the coordinates of the spare component are known the damaged pdf is consistent with other components and relies on the missile hit point distribution in this case the spare gate needs to be modified to an and gate as shown in fig 5 2 when the working coordinates of a spare component are known but the spatial position in the non working state are uncertain the hazard rate of the spare component is determined by the position influence factor β where β 0 1 taking the spare component manually operated visual landing aid system movlas of the landing assist system in fig 2 as an example movlas whose damage threshold range is denoted by the dotted line is spare component for radar assist system and improved fresnel lens optical landing system iflols β 1 indicates that movlas is located at a certain position in the system space and β 0 1 indicates the distance between movlas and working coordinates of the space after obtaining the pdf of damage to spare components at the undetermined location we can convert the dynamic coordinate tree into a static tree and quantify it the method used to obtain the pdf of damage to spare component is elaborated in the next section 3 2 2 hazard rate function z x in the us military standard mil hdbk 338 the hazard function is related to time t and is expressed as the probability of failure occurring at time t but not before time t mil hdbk 338 1984 according to this definition the hazard function can be applied in situations in which component damage is related to space coordinates notably damage is expressed as the conditional probability that there is no damage at other locations but damage occurs within the component damage threshold the evaluated system space is defined as a horizontally two dimensional space constructed in the x direction and y direction and all components are distributed in this space the pdf of damage to spare component in different states will be discussed based on the coordinate x the coordinate x is a random variable in a differentiable distribution function considering the active damage behaviour f x is the pdf of damage occurring at any x and defined as the derivative of the distribution function f x 1 f x f x d f x d x when the component coordinate interval x 0 δ x 0 2 x 0 δ x 0 2 and a cell δ x around it are sufficiently small relative to the whole system space the coordinate interval δ x and the coordinate x 0 have the same pdf and changes in f x in the interval δ x are negligible then the probability of damage in the interval can be approximately expressed as 2 p r x δ x f x 0 δ x thus if no damage occurs at other spatial coordinates and damage is limited to δ x then 2 can be rewritten as 3 p r x δ x p r γ p r x δ x γ where γ indicates that when a missile does not land in the interval x 0 δ x 0 2 x 0 δ x 0 2 δ x will not be damaged p r x δ x γ is the conditional probability of a damage event in the interval δ x which can be written as the product of the hazard rate function z x and the interval length δ x dubi 1998 4 p r x δ x γ z x δ x due to the one dimensional nature of time it is linearly forward and irreversible the occurrence of a failure event at a certain moment indicates that the state was normal until that moment however the damage is related to the space coordinate which means that no damage to other coordinates occurs based on the damage threshold as shown in fig 6 accordingly 5 p r γ 1 f x 0 1 f x 0 δ x 0 2 f x 0 δ x 0 2 then eq 3 can be expressed as follows 6 p r x δ x 1 f x 0 δ x 0 2 f x 0 δ x 0 2 z x δ x combining eqs 2 and 6 we have 7 z x f x 1 f x 0 δ x 0 2 f x 0 δ x 0 2 where f x 0 δ x 0 2 f x 0 δ x 0 2 x 0 δ x 0 2 x 0 δ x 0 2 f x since this value is controlled by the component interval range it is set to a constant c then 7 becomes 8 z x f x 1 c 3 2 3 pdf and cdf of spare component b assuming that a is the primary component of the spare gate and b is the spare component if b is damaged before a dormant state the hazard rate function z x is determined by the position influence factor β if b is damaged after a the hazard rate function z x remains unchanged because of the order relation a unit step is defined boudali and dugan 2006 2008 9 u b a 0 if b a 1 if b a where b and a are nonnegative real numbers if b a then b is damaged first otherwise a is damaged first then the conditional hazard function of b is 10 z x b x a u a b β z b x u b a z b x assuming that the pdf and cdf of the missile hit point distribution are f x and f x respectively the pdf of the damage to b after being activated is f b x f x thus this information can be combined with eq 8 to obtain f b x 1 c z b x moreover the conditional pdf of b is 11 f x b x a 1 c z x b x a 1 c u a b β z b x u b a z b x according to eq 9 when b is in active mode and damaged b a u a b 0 and u b a 1 when b is in a dormant damage state and then damaged b a u a b 1 and u b a 0 thus eq 11 becomes 12 f x b x a f b x if a b β f b x if a b the conditional cdf is 13 f x b x a f b x if a b β f b x if a b taking the normal distribution of f x as an example the damage cdf of b and other normal components in the x direction are shown in fig 7 4 multilevel monte carlo mlmc algorithm 4 1 mcs in this paper the process of using mcs to quantify dldt is 1 sampling n random samples according to the component failure distribution function 2 determining whether the sample falls within the component damage threshold 3 counting the number of the minimum cut sets that occur the ratio of this value to the total number of samplings is the failure probability of the top event it is assumed that the dldt has n minimum cut sets and the number of minimum cut sets occurring in the i th random simulation is denoted by m i thus the top event of the dldt occurs if m i 0 according to the theory of mcs the estimator of the probability of the top event has the following expression 14 s ˆ 1 n i 1 n i m i where i m i is an indicator function i m i 1 if m i 0 and i m i 0 otherwise s ˆ is the top event damage probability n is the number of sampling the variance of the estimator s ˆ is 15 v s ˆ 1 n s s 2 e s v s n where s s 2 is the second moment of s since s ˆ is unbiased only the variance of the estimator needs to be considered in the decomposition of the mean squared error 16 e s ˆ e s 2 e s ˆ e s ˆ e s ˆ e s 2 e s ˆ e s 2 e s ˆ e s ˆ 2 according to central limit theorem the cost of mcs is 17 c o s t m c v s ɛ 2 c where c is the number of minimum cut sets in the system that is the overall computational cost of mcs depends on three factors the variance of the estimator accuracy and the number of minimum cut sets according to eqs 14 and 17 mcs needs to indiscriminately calculate all the minimum cut sets in each random simulation even though some of them may contribute little to s ˆ which is not computationally economical in order to reduce the overall computational cost of estimating s ˆ while maintaining the accuracy level of results section 4 2 modifies mlmc and allocates more calculation resource to the minimum cut sets that contribute more to s ˆ 4 2 mlmc algorithm the idea of mlmc is to quantitatively allocate computational resource according to how much a minimum cut set contributes to s ˆ no computational resources is allocated to the minimum cut set whose contribution is negligible relative to the accuracy requirement or convergence threshold in the quantization of the dldt model to enhance the overall computational performance we take the sequence s 0 s 1 s l as the estimation sequence in the minimum cut set nested sequence c 0 c 1 c l c representing the set of minimum cut sets by linearity of expectation we have 18 e s l e s 0 l 0 l e s l s l 1 and the unbiased estimator of e s l can be expressed as 19 1 n 0 n 1 n 0 s 0 0 n l 1 l 1 n l n 1 n l s l l n s l 1 l n where n l is the number of samples in level l and the superscript l n indicates that the samples used at each level of correction are independent let v 0 and c 0 be the variance and expected cost of one sample of s 0 respectively and let v l and c l be the variance and expected cost of one sample of s l s l 1 in this case the overall expected cost and variance of multilevel estimators are l 0 l n l c o s t l and l 0 l n l 1 v l respectively with the increase of level l if the increase in computational cost grows slower than the decrease in the variance of v l c o s t l we can achieve significant computational savings giles 2008 according to the definition of the number of cut sets in reference aslett et al 2017 the uncertainty of l in operations is not considered thus we prespecify that level l contains c l 2 l minimum cut sets to make v y l decay faster than c l increases the possibility of terminating the algorithm early is considered we make the contribution from each level as large as possible at the smallest levels so that these contributions rapidly decay with increasing level and the convergence conditions are met as soon as possible to achieve this we perform experimental monte carlo simulations of the system to obtain the estimator of the minimum cut set and the overall estimator s ˆ t e s t then the minimum cut sets are sorted and the sorting principle is to maximize the difference between the estimators produced by the minimum cut set of l and l 1 20 e s l s l 1 max in other words choose 21 c l arg max e s l s l 1 c l c s t c l 1 c l according to theorem 1 ii giles 2008 if there is an independent estimator y l based on n l monte carlo samples then 22 e y l e s 0 l 0 e s l s l 1 l 0 in this case a positive constant exists such that for any ɛ e 1 there are values l and n l for which the multilevel estimator is y l 0 l y l thus eq 18 can be expressed as 23 e s l e s 0 l 1 l e s l s l 1 l 0 l e y l as described above we independently estimate each term 24 e y l 1 n l j 1 n l s l j s l 1 j we choose c l the minimum number of cut sets of l as the upper bound of the cost in each stage therefore the overall expected cost and variance of multilevel estimates are 25 c o s t m l m c l 0 l n l c l 26 v l 0 l y l 1 n l l 0 l v y l for a fixed variance the cost can be minimized by selecting n l μ v y l c giles 2015 and the lagrangian multiplier is μ ɛ 2 l 0 l v y l c then the overall expected cost is 27 c o s t m l m c ɛ 2 l 0 l v y l c l 2 compared to the computational cost of mcs in eq 17 if the appropriate approximation values s l and s l 1 are choosed we can make v y l decrease faster than c l increases in this case v y l c l decreases gradually which will reduce computational costs and if we stop the algorithm ahead of time instead of performing calculations at all levels of y based on the convergence condition the cost will be further reduced 4 3 process of the mlmc algorithm one of the key features of the mlmc algorithm is its ability to naturally provide stopping criteria to optimally select the number of levels l ˆ to actually simulate according to theorem 1 giles 2008 as l asymptotically 28 e s ˆ l s ˆ l 1 e s l s ˆ l therefore we have 29 e y l e s l s ˆ l ɛ 2 thus the natural stopping criterion involves selecting the smallest l ˆ such that y l ˆ ɛ 2 the concept of algorithm termination involves selecting some main minimum cut sets for calculations and ignoring the remaining minimum cut set with the lowest probability i e when the convergence condition is satisfied we do not perform calculations for all minimum cut sets but stop the algorithm in advance which will reduce computational costs although the neglected probability of minimum cut sets may be small it will still affect the outcome for a top event after accumulation consequently we introduce the second convergence condition and the contribution of the estimator needs to be considered 30 e s ˆ l s ˆ t e s t α ɛ α 0 1 when the first convergence condition is satisfied but the contribution condition is not satisfied we increase the number of cut sets to satisfy the second convergence condition c l ˆ 2 l ˆ 1 c where c is the number that needs to be increased so that c l ˆ satisfies the following relation 31 c l ˆ arg e s ˆ l s ˆ t e s t α ɛ based on the above theoretical analysis the calculation process of the mlmc algorithm is shown in fig 8 5 warship case study 5 1 establishing a dldt model of aviation support systems in a marine battlefield scenario the main role of aircraft carriers is to control the air and sea in the naval battle zone based on a carrier based aircraft formation if an aircraft carrier loses its ability to guarantee the operation of carrier based aircraft air dominance will be lost therefore in conjunction with the core operational functions of aircraft carriers we take the aircraft carrier s aviation support system as the damage assessment object the aviation support system of an aircraft carrier is mainly composed of transportation ammunition supply aircraft launching and aircraft landing subsystems ignoring minimal probability damage events this paper divides the aviation support system into only four subsystems and several important components additionally combined with the operation process of the aviation support system in fig 9 we establish the dldt model in which the top event is the damage of the aircraft carrier aviation support system and an intermediate event is the damage of the carrier aircraft transportation ammunition supply launching or landing system as shown in fig 10 the transportation and ammunition supply system mainly includes four aircraft elevators and three weapon elevators the aircraft launching system consists of four catapults and the aircraft landing system includes an aiding and arresting system the probability of the missile hit is affected by ship susceptibility evasive motion and ship dynamic instability under severe sea conditions ball and calvano 2009 france et al 2003 somayajula et al 2019 kim et al 2014 it is difficult to obtain its explicit expression thus the pdf corresponding to the missile hit point is generally obtained through statistical methods in the ship survivability analysis programme motiss taking the centre point of the ship deck as the origin the pdf of the missile hit point is defined based on normal distributions in the ship length directions chung and kwon 2008 however considering that the width of the flight deck of an aircraft carrier is much larger than that of a general ship the distributions of hit points in the length and width directions are normal distributions of n 0 60 and n 0 15 respectively based on public information we can obtain the spatial distribution of components as shown in fig 11 and determine the coordinate range of each component to input into the mlmc algorithm in addition based on the given missile hit point distribution and damage threshold we can use the mlmc algorithm to solve the dldt model 5 2 analysis of results based on the damage probability results for all components and component coordinates we build a contour map of the damage probability for the ship s length and width associated with an external attack as shown in fig 12 the theoretical results indicate that the damage probability of the components gradually decreases from the centre of the hull to the surrounding area which is consistent with the distribution of the missile hit points in the length and width directions the mlmc algorithm is used to solve the dldt model and the relationship between the damage probabilities of components and the number of weapons is obtained for cases with multiple anti ship weapons figs 13 and 14 show the damage probabilities of 22 key components with 1 4 weapons and 5 8 weapons shown in different colours from the inside to the outside circles the red line at the end of the ribbon corresponds to the outermost scale value which indicates the probability value the inner circle indicates that the systems to which the 22 key components belong are the ts transportation system ass ammunition supply system ais aiding system ars arresting system and als aircraft launching system the damage probabilities of these 5 subsystems are shown in fig 15 similarly the circles from the inside to the outside represent the damage probabilities of the 5 subsystems for 1 8 weapons because nos 20 22 are far from the centre of the hull and no 22 is a spare part with an unknown coordinate position the damage probabilities of the three components in figs 13 15 are small and do not change significantly as the number of anti ship weapons increases moreover the damage probability of the ais is close to 0 the ts and ass contain numerous parallel components when the number of missiles is less than 4 and 7 respectively the damage probabilities of the ts and ass are close to 0 thus the probability of that the systems are negligible finally we can obtain the damage probability for aviation support system as summarized in table 1 the damage probabilities of the key components and subsystems mentioned above provide a reference for formulating a battle plan 5 3 result verification under the same conditions two weapons we use mcs to verify the accuracy of the mlmc algorithm additionally to ensure the reliability of the verification results we exponentially increase the number of mcs samples and obtain subsequent solutions the true value of top event probability is 0 238202 the top event probabilities obtained with the mcs and mlmc algorithms are 0 238506 and 0 238127 respectively moreover the corresponding errors are 1 27e 3 and 3 15e 4 these findings suggest that mlmc algorithm meets the calculation accuracy requirements of the studied scenario and the computational cost is approximately 71 of mcs in terms of reducing cost we combine the output results for the minimum cut set for illustration fig 16 shows that at a fixed damage threshold when the number of anti ship weapons is decreased the probability of obtaining a partial minimum cut set is low or even 0 with an increase in the number of anti ship weapons the probability of cut sets 4 14 increases significantly and the remaining cut sets do not obviously change when using the mlmc algorithm to solve the dldt model the objective of reducing costs involves ignoring cut sets with low damage probabilities which reduces the overall cost to verify the stability of the mlmc approach in obtaining cost savings under different conditions we change the calculation accuracy requirements and perform multiple simulations the computational costs of the mlmc algorithm is significantly less than that of mcs under different precision requirements as shown in fig 17 in summary the mlmc algorithm can reduce the overall computational cost under the premise of ensuring accuracy however since only the damage to subsystems and equipment is considered in this case the damage results are not refined to the part level if the part level was considered the number of minimum cut sets would increase exponentially and many cut sets with low damage probabilities would be ignored consequently the cost saving advantage of the mlmc algorithm would be more obvious in such situations 6 conclusions and recommendations this paper develops a method to evaluate system functional damage to large scale surface warships after being attacked the method consists of two parts the dldt model and mlmc the former is used to describe the logical relationships among ship system functions and the latter provide efficient and accurate predictions based on component damage consequences the dldt model is a damage tree with system location attributes and after modifying its logic gates we distinguish the damage attributes expressed by the dldt model from the failure attributes of reliability analysis and then calculate the pdf and cdf of the damage to spare components when the coordinates are unknown based on the hazard function thus the dldt model can describe complex ship systems with incomplete information regarding the locations of spare parts in the quantification of the dldt model the mlmc algorithm which can reduce the computational cost is adopted mcs is used to verify that the mlmc algorithm can reduce the computational cost and meet the accuracy requirements of practical scenarios additionally the greater the number of minimum cut sets is the more significant the cost saving effect through a case study the mlmc algorithm can output the damage probability of top events subsystems components and minimum cut sets considering different numbers of weapons this approach significantly contributes to the efficient and accurate damage assessment to large scale surface warships in damage assessment the probability of ship system damage is related to not only the spatial distribution of anti ship weapons and component coordinates but also to the relevant damage thresholds therefore in the process of dldt quantification it is necessary to perform vulnerability analyses of ship structures through experiments and simulations to determine the damage thresholds of components these tasks will be considered in future studies credit

20318,a numerical study based on a wake oscillator model has been performed to determine the three dimensional vortex induced vibration viv responses of a flexible cylinder subjected to uniform and non uniform flows the coupling equations of the structural oscillator and wake oscillator models in the cross flow cf and in line il directions have been solved by employing a standard central finite difference method the structural displacement structural frequency response wave pattern response trajectory for three different aspect ratios and four different flow profiles have been compared as the shear parameter β increases the maximum rms values for a certain aspect ratio in both cf and il directions display apparent decreasing tendencies however for a certain β the maximum rms values in cf and il directions vary slightly with the increased aspect ratio the viv displacements in both cf and il directions exhibit standing wave and traveling wave behaviors simultaneously further as the shear parameter β increases the traveling wave behaviors becomes increasingly dominant the value of dominant frequency of the cf displacement is always half of that of the il displacement the dominant frequency participates in the viv process at all times whereas the other peak frequencies intermittently participate in the viv process keywords vortex induced vibration flexible cylinder three dimensional wake oscillator model linear shear flow 1 introduction vortex induced vibration viv of cylindrical structures is of practical interest to several branches of ocean engineering for example it influences the dynamic characteristics of offshore risers mooring cables pipelines and the tendons of the tension leg platform tlp the dynamic load induced by viv can result in the rapid accumulation of the fatigue damage or the sudden collapse of the structure hence the prediction of viv of the structure is one of the key issues during the process of structural design the problems related to viv have been studied by many researchers in the past decades owing to the complexity of the fluid solid coupling characteristics most of the early research has focused on the rigid cylinders for investigating the fundamental mechanism of viv feng 1968 sarpkaya 1979 bearman 1984 govardhan and williamson 2000 however the viv responses of flexible cylinders have recently received considerable attention in the ocean engineering practice along with the rapid development of the exploitation of the marine resources in the deep sea field the viv problems of flexible cylinders have been studied by several researchers recently these studies can be primarily categorized into physical experiments and numerical computations although the experimental methods produce reliable results chaplin et al 2005 trim et al 2005 vandiver et al 2009 song et al 2011 kang and jia 2013 wang et al 2019 they have certain limitations such as the model scale limit expensive cost and the difficulty of flow profile generation numerical methods can overcome some of these limitations for example the cost of research can be considerably reduced when compared with experimental methods two numerical methods are generally employed for predicting viv of flexible cylinders i e computational fluid dynamics cfd and semi empirical methods the former method computes the fluid forces by solving the navier stokes equations directly whereas the latter one determines the fluid forces empirically the cfd method reliably estimates the hydrodynamic forces exerted on the cylinder in addition to the detailed information of the flow filed behind the structure gao et al 2020 however when compared with the semi empirical method the cfd method incurs excessive computational cost furthermore for large values of length to diameter aspect ratio of a cylinder establishing a full three dimensional cfd model for predicting its viv responses becomes impractical therefore to meet the requirement of the long flexible cylinders used in the ocean engineering it is necessary to propose a selected model that can predict their important characteristics quickly recently the wake oscillator method as one of the semi empirical methods has been widely used for predicting viv of long flexible structures bishop and hassan 1964 have first proposed a self exciting and self limiting van der pol equation to determine the hydrodynamic force acting on the structure in viv hartlen and currie 1970 have developed the first wake oscillator model by following the suggestion of bishop and hassan 1964 where the structural vibration velocity and the van der pol equation were coupled with each other thereafter the wake oscillator has been extensively employed to predict the viv responses of rigid cylinders as listed in table 1 the structural vibration system is simplified to a single degree of freedom dof rigid body for the viv studies of rigid cylinders all the related studies of rigid cylinders in table 1 are conducted in a uniform flow furthermore based on the structural vibration direction these studies can be mainly categorized into two types i e those that examine viv only in the cf direction and those that examine coupled cf and il vibrations according to table 2 the wake oscillator method has been extensively employed to predict viv of flexible cylinders owing to the accelerated use of long flexible cylinders in ocean engineering with the rapid development of marine resources in deep waters according to the contribution of the bending stiffness being considered the flexible cylinders can be simplified as a finite beam model and an infinite cable model similar to the viv studies of rigid cylinders based on the vibration direction the numerical studies on flexible cylinders can also be classified into two main categories i e unidirectional vibration studies and coupled vibration studies according to table 2 there are fewer studies about a flexible cylinder subjected to a non uniform flow when compared with the number of publications dedicated to a flexible cylinder in a uniform flow however in practical ocean engineering the flow profile is non uniform among the non uniform flows the simplest one is a linear shear flow where the flow velocity is linearly distributed along the structural span the response characteristics of the coupled viv of a flexible cylinder subjected to a linear shear flow are still not well understood for example as the shear parameter and aspect ratio change how do the vibration characteristics of the structural vibration responses such as vibration displacement frequency and trajectory of a long flexible cylinder in both cf and il directions vary furthermore how do the shear parameter and aspect ratio influence the characteristics of the wave patterns of the vibration displacements of a flexible cylinder in the study reported in this paper based on our earlier researches gao et al 2018 2019a 2019b 2019c 2019a 2019c the wake oscillator model using the van der pol equation has been employed to predict the coupled viv responses of a flexible cylinder the three different linear shear flows have been selected for the numerical study furthermore a uniform flow has also been studied for the comparison analysis the paper is divided into five sections brief descriptions of the coupled models of the structural vibration and wake oscillator are provided in section 2 in section 3 the details regarding the numerical method for solving the coupled equations are introduced in section 4 the coupled viv responses that includes the response displacement response envelop response wave pattern and response frequency of a flexible cylinder with different aspect ratios and flow profiles are systematically studied finally in section 5 we present the conclusions based on the results 2 model description fig 1 shows a flexible cylinder with length l and diameter d which freely oscillates in both cf and il directions simultaneously the cylinder has pinned pinned boundary conditions the lower end of the cylinder is selected as the coordinate origin o whereas x y and z correspond to the il cf and upward directions respectively the three directions of x y and z constitute a right handed rectangular coordinate system the tension and the bending stiffness are θ and ei respectively the incoming flow velocity is dependent on the location z expressed as u z we use the shear parameter β to model the different flow profiles as shown in fig 1 the shear parameter β is defined as β u max u min u max considering the circular flexible cylinder shown in fig 1 as a slender tensioned beam model we establish the following vibration equations as 1 m s m f 2 x z t t 2 r s r f x z t t θ 2 x z t z 2 e i 4 x z t z 4 f x z t 2 m s m

expressed as m f c m ρd 2π 4 where ρ is the fluid density and c m is the added mass ratio c m 1 0 for a circular cylinder furthermore r s and r f represent the structural damping coefficient and fluid damping coefficient respectively the structural damping coefficient r s is set to zero r s 0 and the fluid damping coefficient is expressed as r f γω f ρd 2 where ω f is calculated based on the strouhal relationship ω f can be expressed as 2πstu z d where st represents the strouhal number the symbol γ stands for the stall parameter that can be expressed as γ c d 4 π s t where c d is the average drag coefficient assigned with a constant value of 1 2 for our study for a stationary cylinder the vibration directions of f x and f y acting on the cylinder coincide with the directions of the drag force f d and the lift force f l respectively however for an oscillating cylinder owing to the structural vibration the relative velocity v z t between the structure and the fluid no longer coincides with the x direction which in turn disorient the directions of f d and f l from the x and y directions respectively fig 2 shows the cross section of the cylinder with coordinate z and the angle between the direction of the relative velocity v z t and the direction of the flow velocity u z is denoted as θ t assuming a small angle of attack θ t we give the following equations 3 sin θ t y

which can be formulated as 7 f d z t 1 2 ρ d u 2 z c d z t f d 1 2 ρ d u 2 z c d z t f l 1 2 ρ d u 2 z c l z t in eq 7 c d z t c d z t and c l z t represent the average drag coefficient fluctuating drag coefficient and lift coefficient respectively as introduced before the value of c d z t is set as 1 2 c d z t and c l z t are expressed as c d z t c d0 p z t 2 c l z t c l0 q z t 2 where c d0 and c l0 are the fluctuating drag coefficient and the lift coefficient for a stationary cylinder respectively c d0 0 2 c l0 0 3 p z t and q z t represent the wake oscillator motions in the x and y directions respectively of the cylinder at the location z the modified van der pol equation is employed to satisfy the nonlinear characteristics of the wake oscillator and the expressions is given as

central finite difference method of the second order in both space and time domains we suppose that the whole dimensionless length l d can be divided into m segments and the total calculated dimensionless time t total can be divided into n segments thus each values of the space step δz and the time step δt are l d m and t total n respectively the m 1 discretized space points can be expressed as z z i i 0 1 2 m and the n 1 discretized time points can be expressed as t t j j 0 1 2 n we suppose that the dimensionless parameters x y p and q at location z m with time t n are denoted as y n m x n m p n m and q n m respectively the related partial derivatives of the second order with respect to x y p and q in eqs 11 14 can be formulated as 16 x t x n 1 m x n 1 m 2 δ t y t y n 1 m y

at t t 0 and t 1 have all been obtained for solving the corresponding values after t t 2 the boundary conditions need to be used we have pinned the boundary conditions at both the ends implying that the displacements and the bending moments in both x and y directions are always zero which is given as 26 x 0 t x l d t 0 2 x 0 t z 2 2 x l d t z 2 0 y 0 t y l d t 0 2 y 0 t z 2 2 y l d t z 2 0 as shown in eqs 20 23 for n 2 the values of x n 1 m and y n 1 m 2 m m 2 can be directly obtained without boundary conditions when m 0 and m m the boundary condition of zero displacements should be used as 27 x n 1 0 y n 1 0 x n 1 m y n 1 m 0 when m 1 and m m 1 the zero bending moment of the boundary condition needs to be used as 28 x n 1 x n 1 y n 1 y n 1 x n m 1 x n m 1 y n m 1 y n m 1 substituting eqs 27 and 28 into eqs 20 and 22 the values of x n 1 m and y n 1 m m 0 1 m 1 and m near the two ends of the cylinder can be obtained hence the values of p n 1 m and q n 1 m can be evaluated according to eqs 21 and 23 accordingly the values of x y p and q at every time steps n 2 can be iteratively calculated the numerical method used in the current work had been validated in our previous works gao et al 2018 2019a 2019b 2019a furthermore to ensure the robustness of the present method the independency tests of the step sizes in both the time and space domains besides the initial conditions of the excitation had also been conducted gao et al 2019c thus no additional validation work has been performed here 4 results and discussion in previous studies we focused on the viv characteristics of a flexible cylinder constrained to oscillate exclusively in the cf direction however here we focus on the coupled cf and il viv characteristics of a flexible cylinder in both the uniform and linearly sheared flows thus the present work is a continuation of our earlier research gao et al 2018 2019a 2019b 2019c 2019a 2019c the dimensionless parameters used in this section have the same values with those used in our earlier works i e μ 2 785 c 23 6 and b 303 furthermore three different aspect ratios l d 100 200 and 500 have been selected for the study 4 1 space time evolutions of viv displacement fig 3 5 show the dimensionless vibration displacement responses for l d 100 200 and 500 respectively the first column shows the different flow profiles the second column gives the vibration displacement envelope in the cf direction the fourth and fifth columns sequentially present the vibration displacement envelopes in the il direction with and without removing the average value respectively the third and sixth columns provide the rms values of the vibration displacement response in the cf and il directions respectively for all l d with the increase of the shear parameters β the maximum value of the rms value of the vibration displacement in the cf direction and the il direction besides the maximum value of the average value of the vibration displacement in the il direction show downward trends with the increase of β the maximum rms value of the vibration displacement in the il direction decreases more quickly when compared with that of the cf direction furthermore as β increases the position of the maximum value of the mean vibration displacement in the il direction gradually moves to the top end of the structure according to fig 3 for l d 100 the vibration displacement responses in the cf and il directions are dominated by the first order mode and the second order mode respectively from the third column in fig 3 for all β the maximum value of the vibration displacement response in the cf direction appears at the midpoint z 50 we find from the rms value of the vibration displacement in the il direction at the node that the vibration displacement in the il direction is near zero this phenomenon indicates that the vibration response in the il direction is a mix of the standing wave and traveling wave behaviors when β 0 0 3 and 0 5 the rms value of the vibration displacement at the antinode in the il direction is much larger than the rms value at the node this indicates that the standing wave is dominant at this instant however when β 0 7 the rms value of the vibration displacement at the anti node 0 004 in the il direction is slightly larger than the rms value at the node 0 003 which indicates that the traveling wave is dominant at this instant fig 4 shows that for l d 200 the vibration displacement response in the cf and il directions are dominated by the second order and the fourth order modes respectively for all β the vibration displacement response in the cf direction is dominated by the standing waves however the rms value of the non zero vibration displacement at the cf direction node shows that the structural vibration also exhibits a slight traveling wave characteristic when β 0 and 0 3 the rms value of the vibration displacement at the anti node in the il direction is approximately 5 10 times that at the node which indicates that the standing wave is dominant at this instant for β 0 5 and 0 7 the rms value at the anti node in the il direction is approximately twice that at the node thus indicating that the vibration displacement response is dominated by the standing waves and traveling waves simultaneously according to fig 5 for l d 500 and β 0 the vibration displacement response in the cf and il directions are dominated by the sixth order and the tenth order modes respectively when β 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 the vibration displacement response in the cf direction is dominated by the fifth order mode we find from the third column that the rms value at the anti node in the cf direction is much greater than the rms value at the node this implies that the vibration displacement response in the cf direction displays obvious standing wave response characteristics for the il direction when β 0 along the entire axis direction the rms value at the anti node is much greater than the rms value at the node this implies that the vibration displacement response in the il direction is dominated by the standing waves along the entire axis for β 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 the vibration displacement response in the il direction displays completely different characteristics from that for β 0 near the upper and lower endpoints the rms value at the anti node point is much greater than the rms value at the node however in the central area of the structure the rms value at the anti node becomes proximate to that at the node it shows that the structural vibration is dominated by standing waves near the two ends of the structure whereas in the middle area of the structure the structural vibration is dominated by traveling waves figs 6 and 7 show the evolutions of the non dimensional vibration displacements in the cf and il directions along time and span respectively the standing wave and traveling wave response characteristics shown in fig 3 5 have been reflected more distinctly in figs 6 and 7 in both cf and il directions with the increase of β the traveling wave characteristics of the vibration displacement response become increasingly obvious when l d 200 and 500 along the entire axis direction the vibration displacement response in the cf direction is dominated by the standing waves with a mix of slight traveling wave characteristics when l d 500 for uniform incoming flow the vibration displacement response in the il direction along the entire axis is dominated by the standing waves for a non uniform incoming flow near the ends of the cylinder the vibration displacement response in the il direction displays an obvious dominant characteristic of the standing waves however in the vicinity of the middle section of the cylinder the vibration displacement response in the il direction displays the dominant behavior of traveling waves 4 2 viv frequency response and viv trajectories figs 8 and 9 depict the frequency response characteristics of the vibration displacement of the cylinder along the z direction under different shear parameters β in the cf and il directions respectively according to fig 8 for all cases the frequency response of the viv displacement of the cylinder in the cf direction shows a single frequency distribution this implies that there is only one peak frequency in the displacement response furthermore for all the research conditions the vibration displacement in the cf direction varies with time consistently when l d is small l d 100 and 200 for uniform incoming flow β 0 the viv displacement frequency response in the il direction indicates a single frequency distribution characteristic for a non uniform incoming flow β 0 the structural vibration displacement response in the il direction shows a multi frequency distribution characteristic alternatively stated there are several peak frequencies in the il displacement response with the increase of the shear parameter β the number of peak frequencies in the il direction gradually increases furthermore the frequency bandwidth gradually expands when l d is relatively larger l d 500 for a uniform incoming flow β 0 the structural vibration displacement response in the il direction has two peak frequencies one frequency appears near ω 2 and the other one appears near ω 0 furthermore the bandwidth of these two peak frequencies is very narrow thus indicating that the energy distributions of the structural vibration frequencies are very concentrated the peak frequency in the il direction near the zero point is caused by the oscillatory change of the average value of the vibration displacement in the il direction over time this aspect will be further discussed in detail combined with the displacement vibration time history curve in the following part when l d 500 for a non uniform incoming flow the frequency response of the vibration displacement in the il direction shows multiple frequencies and the frequency bands are all relatively wide therefore when compared with a uniform flow the energy distribution of the structure vibration frequency under a non uniform flow is more dispersed fig 10 gives the vibration trajectories of cylinders with different aspect ratios under different flow profiles the structural location selected for the study of the vibration trajectory is the location of the maximum of the rms value in the cf direction it can be seen from the figure that when l d 100 and 200 for a uniform incoming flow β 0 the vibration trajectory presents a typical figure of eight shape however the width of the vibration track distribution band is wider at l d 200 than for l d 100 this primarily owes to the vibration frequency response of the structure in the il direction for l d 200 besides the dominant frequency where another peak frequency exists near the dominant one with a near zero response amplitude this will be further discussed in the following part in combination with the spectrum analysis when l d 100 and 200 for a non uniform incoming flow β 0 the vibration trajectory has a chaotic trajectory characteristic when l d 500 for a uniform incoming flow β 0 the vibration trajectory displays a typical figure eight shape in a short period of time however it will show a larger oscillation owing to the mean value of vibration displacement in the il direction changing with time which further leads to an irregular characteristic of the vibration trajectory in a long period of time the vibration trajectory at this instant is composed of several figure eight shapes with different mean values of il directions when l d 500 for a non uniform incoming flow β 0 the vibration trajectory appears chaotic again for a further study of the viv frequency response characteristics varying with time figs 11 13 show the time history variation characteristics of the viv displacement for different aspect ratios the vibration frequency spectrum characteristics and the time variation characteristics of the vibration frequency here two typical flow profiles have been selected for the study one is the uniform flow β 0 and the other is the non uniform flow with the largest shear parameter value β 0 7 according to the time history curves in the figure for all l d the vibration in the cf direction is very regular when the structure is subjected to a uniform flow field and the corresponding amplitude has a constant value compared with the cf direction the vibration response in the il direction has distinctly different characteristics the vibration amplitude in the il direction generally remains a constant however the amplitude of the mean vibration displacement in the il direction gradually increases with the increase of l d when the structure is in a non uniform flow field the cf vibration is very regular with a constant amplitude by contrast the irregular vibration in the il direction displays chaotic characteristics it can be seen from the vibration spectrogram in the figure that for all l d the dimensionless dominant frequency in the il direction is twice that in the cf direction when the structure is in a uniform flow it will cause the vibration trajectory of the structure in the uniform flow field to display a figure of eight shape as shown in fig 10 a when the structure is in a non uniform flow field the vibration response in the cf direction still exhibits single frequency vibration response characteristics however the vibration response in the il direction shows distinct multi frequency response characteristics further the dominant frequency in the il direction is approximately twice that of the cf direction the graph of vibration frequency changes with time in the figure shows that for a uniform incoming flow and for both the cf and il directions the dominant frequency will participate in the vibration response throughout the entire viv process for the vibration response in the il direction subjected to a uniform flow the dominant frequency will participate in the viv process throughout but the other non dominant peak frequencies will intermittently participate in the vibration response 5 conclusions we have established a coupling model of viv in the cf and il directions of a flexible cylinder based on the wake oscillator method subsequently the numerical model is first discretized and then iteratively solved using a central difference scheme with second order accuracy three different aspect ratios l d 100 200 and 500 and four different flow profiles β 0 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 have been studied the vibration response characteristics of the flexible cylinder including vibration displacement vibration frequency and vibration trajectory are systematically discussed and analyzed based on the above analysis the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the number of dominant modes in the both cf and il directions gradually increase as the aspect ratio increases for the same l d the rms values of the vibration displacement in the cf and il directions and the average value of the vibration displacement in the il direction all show downward trends with the increase of β as β increases the position of the maximum value of the mean vibration displacement in the il direction appears gradually moving to the top end of the structure however for the same flow profile for which the value of β is a constant the maximum values of the rms displacements in the cf and il directions only have a miniscule change with the increase of the aspect ratio the viv response of the flexible cylinder in both the uniform and non uniform flows have been found with standing wave and traveling wave characteristics according to the rms value of the vibration displacement at the node and the anti node furthermore the traveling wave characteristics in the cf and il directions become gradually stronger with the increase of β 2 for all values of l d the cf viv displacement response along the entire axis is dominated by the standing waves with a mix of miniscule traveling wave characteristics compared with the cf direction the vibration displacement response in the il direction is more complicated for flexible cylinders with l d 100 and 200 the viv displacement response in the il direction is dominated by the standing waves along the entire axis for the structure is in a flow field with small β values β 0 0 3 and 0 5 however when the structure is in a flow with a large β value β 0 7 the il vibration response is dominated by the standing and traveling waves simultaneously along the whole span for a flexible cylinder with l d 500 the vibration displacement response in the il direction is dominated by standing waves along the entire span for the structure is in a uniform flow field when the structure is in a non uniform flow field the vibration displacement responses of the structure are dominated by the standing waves and traveling waves respectively near the two ends and the central area of the structure 3 for all the cases the frequency response of the viv displacement in the cf direction shows a single frequency response characteristic however for the il direction except for the conditions of l d 100 and β 0 the frequency response of the vibration displacement in the il direction indicates a multi frequency response characteristic furthermore the dominant frequency in the il direction is twice that of the cf direction for all values of l d when the structure is in a non uniform flow field the dominant frequencies in the cf and il directions will emerge in the vibration response throughout the entire process however the other non dominant peak frequencies in the il direction will emerge only in the vibration response intermittently when the structure is in a uniform flow field the vibration trajectory of the structure displays a typical figure eight or a chaotic shape which comprises of several figure eight shapes when the structure is in a non uniform flow field its vibration trajectory displays an irregular chaotic shape all the numerical results presented in this paper were finished in a few minutes to an hour of processing time on a personal computer clearly demonstrating that compared with the experimental and cfd methods the wake oscillator method has one obvious advantage that it only consumes a small computational cost therefore the numerical method proposed in this paper can be developed to conduct large parametrical studies of coupled cf and il viv responses on a long flexible cylinder which are urgently needed in practical ocean engineering in general the present numerical method can roughly predict some important characteristics of coupled cf and il vibrations however due to the simplicity of the wake oscillator method we have to admit that it also has some inevitable disadvantages one is that the wake oscillator method cannot provide the detailed information of the wake characteristics behind the cylinder another disadvantage is that the calculation precision using the present method needs to be further improved in our future work to offset the missing studies of flow dynamics around the cylinder along the span we would like to choose some typical cases to study the flow characteristics using a three dimensional cfd method furthermore in order to make sure that the present method can be developed to predict the coupled cf and il viv responses of flexible cylinders used in the real application we also would like to explore the study to increase the calculation precision of the wake oscillator model using two methods one method is to refit the empirical parameters such as a and ε while keeping the wake oscillator model unchanged the other method is to change the wake oscillator model from low order to high order however it should also be noted that a high order model will have more empirical parameters which can increase the output uncertainty of the numerical model credit

20318,a numerical study based on a wake oscillator model has been performed to determine the three dimensional vortex induced vibration viv responses of a flexible cylinder subjected to uniform and non uniform flows the coupling equations of the structural oscillator and wake oscillator models in the cross flow cf and in line il directions have been solved by employing a standard central finite difference method the structural displacement structural frequency response wave pattern response trajectory for three different aspect ratios and four different flow profiles have been compared as the shear parameter β increases the maximum rms values for a certain aspect ratio in both cf and il directions display apparent decreasing tendencies however for a certain β the maximum rms values in cf and il directions vary slightly with the increased aspect ratio the viv displacements in both cf and il directions exhibit standing wave and traveling wave behaviors simultaneously further as the shear parameter β increases the traveling wave behaviors becomes increasingly dominant the value of dominant frequency of the cf displacement is always half of that of the il displacement the dominant frequency participates in the viv process at all times whereas the other peak frequencies intermittently participate in the viv process keywords vortex induced vibration flexible cylinder three dimensional wake oscillator model linear shear flow 1 introduction vortex induced vibration viv of cylindrical structures is of practical interest to several branches of ocean engineering for example it influences the dynamic characteristics of offshore risers mooring cables pipelines and the tendons of the tension leg platform tlp the dynamic load induced by viv can result in the rapid accumulation of the fatigue damage or the sudden collapse of the structure hence the prediction of viv of the structure is one of the key issues during the process of structural design the problems related to viv have been studied by many researchers in the past decades owing to the complexity of the fluid solid coupling characteristics most of the early research has focused on the rigid cylinders for investigating the fundamental mechanism of viv feng 1968 sarpkaya 1979 bearman 1984 govardhan and williamson 2000 however the viv responses of flexible cylinders have recently received considerable attention in the ocean engineering practice along with the rapid development of the exploitation of the marine resources in the deep sea field the viv problems of flexible cylinders have been studied by several researchers recently these studies can be primarily categorized into physical experiments and numerical computations although the experimental methods produce reliable results chaplin et al 2005 trim et al 2005 vandiver et al 2009 song et al 2011 kang and jia 2013 wang et al 2019 they have certain limitations such as the model scale limit expensive cost and the difficulty of flow profile generation numerical methods can overcome some of these limitations for example the cost of research can be considerably reduced when compared with experimental methods two numerical methods are generally employed for predicting viv of flexible cylinders i e computational fluid dynamics cfd and semi empirical methods the former method computes the fluid forces by solving the navier stokes equations directly whereas the latter one determines the fluid forces empirically the cfd method reliably estimates the hydrodynamic forces exerted on the cylinder in addition to the detailed information of the flow filed behind the structure gao et al 2020 however when compared with the semi empirical method the cfd method incurs excessive computational cost furthermore for large values of length to diameter aspect ratio of a cylinder establishing a full three dimensional cfd model for predicting its viv responses becomes impractical therefore to meet the requirement of the long flexible cylinders used in the ocean engineering it is necessary to propose a selected model that can predict their important characteristics quickly recently the wake oscillator method as one of the semi empirical methods has been widely used for predicting viv of long flexible structures bishop and hassan 1964 have first proposed a self exciting and self limiting van der pol equation to determine the hydrodynamic force acting on the structure in viv hartlen and currie 1970 have developed the first wake oscillator model by following the suggestion of bishop and hassan 1964 where the structural vibration velocity and the van der pol equation were coupled with each other thereafter the wake oscillator has been extensively employed to predict the viv responses of rigid cylinders as listed in table 1 the structural vibration system is simplified to a single degree of freedom dof rigid body for the viv studies of rigid cylinders all the related studies of rigid cylinders in table 1 are conducted in a uniform flow furthermore based on the structural vibration direction these studies can be mainly categorized into two types i e those that examine viv only in the cf direction and those that examine coupled cf and il vibrations according to table 2 the wake oscillator method has been extensively employed to predict viv of flexible cylinders owing to the accelerated use of long flexible cylinders in ocean engineering with the rapid development of marine resources in deep waters according to the contribution of the bending stiffness being considered the flexible cylinders can be simplified as a finite beam model and an infinite cable model similar to the viv studies of rigid cylinders based on the vibration direction the numerical studies on flexible cylinders can also be classified into two main categories i e unidirectional vibration studies and coupled vibration studies according to table 2 there are fewer studies about a flexible cylinder subjected to a non uniform flow when compared with the number of publications dedicated to a flexible cylinder in a uniform flow however in practical ocean engineering the flow profile is non uniform among the non uniform flows the simplest one is a linear shear flow where the flow velocity is linearly distributed along the structural span the response characteristics of the coupled viv of a flexible cylinder subjected to a linear shear flow are still not well understood for example as the shear parameter and aspect ratio change how do the vibration characteristics of the structural vibration responses such as vibration displacement frequency and trajectory of a long flexible cylinder in both cf and il directions vary furthermore how do the shear parameter and aspect ratio influence the characteristics of the wave patterns of the vibration displacements of a flexible cylinder in the study reported in this paper based on our earlier researches gao et al 2018 2019a 2019b 2019c 2019a 2019c the wake oscillator model using the van der pol equation has been employed to predict the coupled viv responses of a flexible cylinder the three different linear shear flows have been selected for the numerical study furthermore a uniform flow has also been studied for the comparison analysis the paper is divided into five sections brief descriptions of the coupled models of the structural vibration and wake oscillator are provided in section 2 in section 3 the details regarding the numerical method for solving the coupled equations are introduced in section 4 the coupled viv responses that includes the response displacement response envelop response wave pattern and response frequency of a flexible cylinder with different aspect ratios and flow profiles are systematically studied finally in section 5 we present the conclusions based on the results 2 model description fig 1 shows a flexible cylinder with length l and diameter d which freely oscillates in both cf and il directions simultaneously the cylinder has pinned pinned boundary conditions the lower end of the cylinder is selected as the coordinate origin o whereas x y and z correspond to the il cf and upward directions respectively the three directions of x y and z constitute a right handed rectangular coordinate system the tension and the bending stiffness are θ and ei respectively the incoming flow velocity is dependent on the location z expressed as u z we use the shear parameter β to model the different flow profiles as shown in fig 1 the shear parameter β is defined as β u max u min u max considering the circular flexible cylinder shown in fig 1 as a slender tensioned beam model we establish the following vibration equations as 1 m s m f 2 x z t t 2 r s r f x z t t θ 2 x z t z 2 e i 4 x z t z 4 f x z t 2 m s m

expressed as m f c m ρd 2π 4 where ρ is the fluid density and c m is the added mass ratio c m 1 0 for a circular cylinder furthermore r s and r f represent the structural damping coefficient and fluid damping coefficient respectively the structural damping coefficient r s is set to zero r s 0 and the fluid damping coefficient is expressed as r f γω f ρd 2 where ω f is calculated based on the strouhal relationship ω f can be expressed as 2πstu z d where st represents the strouhal number the symbol γ stands for the stall parameter that can be expressed as γ c d 4 π s t where c d is the average drag coefficient assigned with a constant value of 1 2 for our study for a stationary cylinder the vibration directions of f x and f y acting on the cylinder coincide with the directions of the drag force f d and the lift force f l respectively however for an oscillating cylinder owing to the structural vibration the relative velocity v z t between the structure and the fluid no longer coincides with the x direction which in turn disorient the directions of f d and f l from the x and y directions respectively fig 2 shows the cross section of the cylinder with coordinate z and the angle between the direction of the relative velocity v z t and the direction of the flow velocity u z is denoted as θ t assuming a small angle of attack θ t we give the following equations 3 sin θ t y

c l0 are the fluctuating drag coefficient and the lift coefficient for a stationary cylinder respectively c d0 0 2 c l0 0 3 p z t and q z t represent the wake oscillator motions in the x and y directions respectively of the cylinder at the location z the modified van der pol equation is employed to satisfy the nonlinear characteristics of the wake oscillator and the expressions is given as

central finite difference method of the second order in both space and time domains we suppose that the whole dimensionless length l d can be divided into m segments and the total calculated dimensionless time t total can be divided into n segments thus each values of the space step δz and the time step δt are l d m and t total n respectively the m 1 discretized space points can be expressed as z z i i 0 1 2 m and the n 1 discretized time points can be expressed as t t j j 0 1 2 n we suppose that the dimensionless parameters x y p and q at location z m with time t n are denoted as y n m x n m p n m and q n m respectively the related partial derivatives of the second order with respect to x y p and q in eqs 11 14 can be formulated as 16 x t x n 1 m x n 1 m 2 δ t y t y n 1 m y

besides the velocities are also zero which is expressed as x y x t y t 0 the initial conditions of p and q are set to a wavelength excitation with a small amplitude and p t q t 0 combining the expressions in eq 16 we have 24 x 1 m x 1 m y 1 m y 1 m p 1 m p 1 m q 1 m q 1 m substituting eq 24 into eqs 20 23 the values of x y p and q at t t 1 can be obtained as 25 2 y 1 m δ t 2 ω f 2 z m m l q

at t t 0 and t 1 have all been obtained for solving the corresponding values after t t 2 the boundary conditions need to be used we have pinned the boundary conditions at both the ends implying that the displacements and the bending moments in both x and y directions are always zero which is given as 26 x 0 t x l d t 0 2 x 0 t z 2 2 x l d t z 2 0 y 0 t y l d t 0 2 y 0 t z 2 2 y l d t z 2 0 as shown in eqs 20 23 for n 2 the values of x n 1 m and y n 1 m 2 m m 2 can be directly obtained without boundary conditions when m 0 and m m the boundary condition of zero displacements should be used as 27 x n 1 0 y n 1 0 x n 1 m y n 1 m 0 when m 1 and m m 1 the zero bending moment of the boundary condition needs to be used as 28 x n 1 x n 1 y n 1 y n 1 x n m 1 x n m 1 y n m 1 y n m 1 substituting eqs 27 and 28 into eqs 20 and 22 the values of x n 1 m and y n 1 m m 0 1 m 1 and m near the two ends of the cylinder can be obtained hence the values of p n 1 m and q n 1 m can be evaluated according to eqs 21 and 23 accordingly the values of x y p and q at every time steps n 2 can be iteratively calculated the numerical method used in the current work had been validated in our previous works gao et al 2018 2019a 2019b 2019a furthermore to ensure the robustness of the present method the independency tests of the step sizes in both the time and space domains besides the initial conditions of the excitation had also been conducted gao et al 2019c thus no additional validation work has been performed here 4 results and discussion in previous studies we focused on the viv characteristics of a flexible cylinder constrained to oscillate exclusively in the cf direction however here we focus on the coupled cf and il viv characteristics of a flexible cylinder in both the uniform and linearly sheared flows thus the present work is a continuation of our earlier research gao et al 2018 2019a 2019b 2019c 2019a 2019c the dimensionless parameters used in this section have the same values with those used in our earlier works i e μ 2 785 c 23 6 and b 303 furthermore three different aspect ratios l d 100 200 and 500 have been selected for the study 4 1 space time evolutions of viv displacement fig 3 5 show the dimensionless vibration displacement responses for l d 100 200 and 500 respectively the first column shows the different flow profiles the second column gives the vibration displacement envelope in the cf direction the fourth and fifth columns sequentially present the vibration displacement envelopes in the il direction with and without removing the average value respectively the third and sixth columns provide the rms values of the vibration displacement response in the cf and il directions respectively for all l d with the increase of the shear parameters β the maximum value of the rms value of the vibration displacement in the cf direction and the il direction besides the maximum value of the average value of the vibration displacement in the il direction show downward trends with the increase of β the maximum rms value of the vibration displacement in the il direction decreases more quickly when compared with that of the cf direction furthermore as β increases the position of the maximum value of the mean vibration displacement in the il direction gradually moves to the top end of the structure according to fig 3 for l d 100 the vibration displacement responses in the cf and il directions are dominated by the first order mode and the second order mode respectively from the third column in fig 3 for all β the maximum value of the vibration displacement response in the cf direction appears at the midpoint z 50 we find from the rms value of the vibration displacement in the il direction at the node that the vibration displacement in the il direction is near zero this phenomenon indicates that the vibration response in the il direction is a mix of the standing wave and traveling wave behaviors when β 0 0 3 and 0 5 the rms value of the vibration displacement at the antinode in the il direction is much larger than the rms value at the node this indicates that the standing wave is dominant at this instant however when β 0 7 the rms value of the vibration displacement at the anti node 0 004 in the il direction is slightly larger than the rms value at the node 0 003 which indicates that the traveling wave is dominant at this instant fig 4 shows that for l d 200 the vibration displacement response in the cf and il directions are dominated by the second order and the fourth order modes respectively for all β the vibration displacement response in the cf direction is dominated by the standing waves however the rms value of the non zero vibration displacement at the cf direction node shows that the structural vibration also exhibits a slight traveling wave characteristic when β 0 and 0 3 the rms value of the vibration displacement at the anti node in the il direction is approximately 5 10 times that at the node which indicates that the standing wave is dominant at this instant for β 0 5 and 0 7 the rms value at the anti node in the il direction is approximately twice that at the node thus indicating that the vibration displacement response is dominated by the standing waves and traveling waves simultaneously according to fig 5 for l d 500 and β 0 the vibration displacement response in the cf and il directions are dominated by the sixth order and the tenth order modes respectively when β 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 the vibration displacement response in the cf direction is dominated by the fifth order mode we find from the third column that the rms value at the anti node in the cf direction is much greater than the rms value at the node this implies that the vibration displacement response in the cf direction displays obvious standing wave response characteristics for the il direction when β 0 along the entire axis direction the rms value at the anti node is much greater than the rms value at the node this implies that the vibration displacement response in the il direction is dominated by the standing waves along the entire axis for β 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 the vibration displacement response in the il direction displays completely different characteristics from that for β 0 near the upper and lower endpoints the rms value at the anti node point is much greater than the rms value at the node however in the central area of the structure the rms value at the anti node becomes proximate to that at the node it shows that the structural vibration is dominated by standing waves near the two ends of the structure whereas in the middle area of the structure the structural vibration is dominated by traveling waves figs 6 and 7 show the evolutions of the non dimensional vibration displacements in the cf and il directions along time and span respectively the standing wave and traveling wave response characteristics shown in fig 3 5 have been reflected more distinctly in figs 6 and 7 in both cf and il directions with the increase of β the traveling wave characteristics of the vibration displacement response become increasingly obvious when l d 200 and 500 along the entire axis direction the vibration displacement response in the cf direction is dominated by the standing waves with a mix of slight traveling wave characteristics when l d 500 for uniform incoming flow the vibration displacement response in the il direction along the entire axis is dominated by the standing waves for a non uniform incoming flow near the ends of the cylinder the vibration displacement response in the il direction displays an obvious dominant characteristic of the standing waves however in the vicinity of the middle section of the cylinder the vibration displacement response in the il direction displays the dominant behavior of traveling waves 4 2 viv frequency response and viv trajectories figs 8 and 9 depict the frequency response characteristics of the vibration displacement of the cylinder along the z direction under different shear parameters β in the cf and il directions respectively according to fig 8 for all cases the frequency response of the viv displacement of the cylinder in the cf direction shows a single frequency distribution this implies that there is only one peak frequency in the displacement response furthermore for all the research conditions the vibration displacement in the cf direction varies with time consistently when l d is small l d 100 and 200 for uniform incoming flow β 0 the viv displacement frequency response in the il direction indicates a single frequency distribution characteristic for a non uniform incoming flow β 0 the structural vibration displacement response in the il direction shows a multi frequency distribution characteristic alternatively stated there are several peak frequencies in the il displacement response with the increase of the shear parameter β the number of peak frequencies in the il direction gradually increases furthermore the frequency bandwidth gradually expands when l d is relatively larger l d 500 for a uniform incoming flow β 0 the structural vibration displacement response in the il direction has two peak frequencies one frequency appears near ω 2 and the other one appears near ω 0 furthermore the bandwidth of these two peak frequencies is very narrow thus indicating that the energy distributions of the structural vibration frequencies are very concentrated the peak frequency in the il direction near the zero point is caused by the oscillatory change of the average value of the vibration displacement in the il direction over time this aspect will be further discussed in detail combined with the displacement vibration time history curve in the following part when l d 500 for a non uniform incoming flow the frequency response of the vibration displacement in the il direction shows multiple frequencies and the frequency bands are all relatively wide therefore when compared with a uniform flow the energy distribution of the structure vibration frequency under a non uniform flow is more dispersed fig 10 gives the vibration trajectories of cylinders with different aspect ratios under different flow profiles the structural location selected for the study of the vibration trajectory is the location of the maximum of the rms value in the cf direction it can be seen from the figure that when l d 100 and 200 for a uniform incoming flow β 0 the vibration trajectory presents a typical figure of eight shape however the width of the vibration track distribution band is wider at l d 200 than for l d 100 this primarily owes to the vibration frequency response of the structure in the il direction for l d 200 besides the dominant frequency where another peak frequency exists near the dominant one with a near zero response amplitude this will be further discussed in the following part in combination with the spectrum analysis when l d 100 and 200 for a non uniform incoming flow β 0 the vibration trajectory has a chaotic trajectory characteristic when l d 500 for a uniform incoming flow β 0 the vibration trajectory displays a typical figure eight shape in a short period of time however it will show a larger oscillation owing to the mean value of vibration displacement in the il direction changing with time which further leads to an irregular characteristic of the vibration trajectory in a long period of time the vibration trajectory at this instant is composed of several figure eight shapes with different mean values of il directions when l d 500 for a non uniform incoming flow β 0 the vibration trajectory appears chaotic again for a further study of the viv frequency response characteristics varying with time figs 11 13 show the time history variation characteristics of the viv displacement for different aspect ratios the vibration frequency spectrum characteristics and the time variation characteristics of the vibration frequency here two typical flow profiles have been selected for the study one is the uniform flow β 0 and the other is the non uniform flow with the largest shear parameter value β 0 7 according to the time history curves in the figure for all l d the vibration in the cf direction is very regular when the structure is subjected to a uniform flow field and the corresponding amplitude has a constant value compared with the cf direction the vibration response in the il direction has distinctly different characteristics the vibration amplitude in the il direction generally remains a constant however the amplitude of the mean vibration displacement in the il direction gradually increases with the increase of l d when the structure is in a non uniform flow field the cf vibration is very regular with a constant amplitude by contrast the irregular vibration in the il direction displays chaotic characteristics it can be seen from the vibration spectrogram in the figure that for all l d the dimensionless dominant frequency in the il direction is twice that in the cf direction when the structure is in a uniform flow it will cause the vibration trajectory of the structure in the uniform flow field to display a figure of eight shape as shown in fig 10 a when the structure is in a non uniform flow field the vibration response in the cf direction still exhibits single frequency vibration response characteristics however the vibration response in the il direction shows distinct multi frequency response characteristics further the dominant frequency in the il direction is approximately twice that of the cf direction the graph of vibration frequency changes with time in the figure shows that for a uniform incoming flow and for both the cf and il directions the dominant frequency will participate in the vibration response throughout the entire viv process for the vibration response in the il direction subjected to a uniform flow the dominant frequency will participate in the viv process throughout but the other non dominant peak frequencies will intermittently participate in the vibration response 5 conclusions we have established a coupling model of viv in the cf and il directions of a flexible cylinder based on the wake oscillator method subsequently the numerical model is first discretized and then iteratively solved using a central difference scheme with second order accuracy three different aspect ratios l d 100 200 and 500 and four different flow profiles β 0 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 have been studied the vibration response characteristics of the flexible cylinder including vibration displacement vibration frequency and vibration trajectory are systematically discussed and analyzed based on the above analysis the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the number of dominant modes in the both cf and il directions gradually increase as the aspect ratio increases for the same l d the rms values of the vibration displacement in the cf and il directions and the average value of the vibration displacement in the il direction all show downward trends with the increase of β as β increases the position of the maximum value of the mean vibration displacement in the il direction appears gradually moving to the top end of the structure however for the same flow profile for which the value of β is a constant the maximum values of the rms displacements in the cf and il directions only have a miniscule change with the increase of the aspect ratio the viv response of the flexible cylinder in both the uniform and non uniform flows have been found with standing wave and traveling wave characteristics according to the rms value of the vibration displacement at the node and the anti node furthermore the traveling wave characteristics in the cf and il directions become gradually stronger with the increase of β 2 for all values of l d the cf viv displacement response along the entire axis is dominated by the standing waves with a mix of miniscule traveling wave characteristics compared with the cf direction the vibration displacement response in the il direction is more complicated for flexible cylinders with l d 100 and 200 the viv displacement response in the il direction is dominated by the standing waves along the entire axis for the structure is in a flow field with small β values β 0 0 3 and 0 5 however when the structure is in a flow with a large β value β 0 7 the il vibration response is dominated by the standing and traveling waves simultaneously along the whole span for a flexible cylinder with l d 500 the vibration displacement response in the il direction is dominated by standing waves along the entire span for the structure is in a uniform flow field when the structure is in a non uniform flow field the vibration displacement responses of the structure are dominated by the standing waves and traveling waves respectively near the two ends and the central area of the structure 3 for all the cases the frequency response of the viv displacement in the cf direction shows a single frequency response characteristic however for the il direction except for the conditions of l d 100 and β 0 the frequency response of the vibration displacement in the il direction indicates a multi frequency response characteristic furthermore the dominant frequency in the il direction is twice that of the cf direction for all values of l d when the structure is in a non uniform flow field the dominant frequencies in the cf and il directions will emerge in the vibration response throughout the entire process however the other non dominant peak frequencies in the il direction will emerge only in the vibration response intermittently when the structure is in a uniform flow field the vibration trajectory of the structure displays a typical figure eight or a chaotic shape which comprises of several figure eight shapes when the structure is in a non uniform flow field its vibration trajectory displays an irregular chaotic shape all the numerical results presented in this paper were finished in a few minutes to an hour of processing time on a personal computer clearly demonstrating that compared with the experimental and cfd methods the wake oscillator method has one obvious advantage that it only consumes a small computational cost therefore the numerical method proposed in this paper can be developed to conduct large parametrical studies of coupled cf and il viv responses on a long flexible cylinder which are urgently needed in practical ocean engineering in general the present numerical method can roughly predict some important characteristics of coupled cf and il vibrations however due to the simplicity of the wake oscillator method we have to admit that it also has some inevitable disadvantages one is that the wake oscillator method cannot provide the detailed information of the wake characteristics behind the cylinder another disadvantage is that the calculation precision using the present method needs to be further improved in our future work to offset the missing studies of flow dynamics around the cylinder along the span we would like to choose some typical cases to study the flow characteristics using a three dimensional cfd method furthermore in order to make sure that the present method can be developed to predict the coupled cf and il viv responses of flexible cylinders used in the real application we also would like to explore the study to increase the calculation precision of the wake oscillator model using two methods one method is to refit the empirical parameters such as a and ε while keeping the wake oscillator model unchanged the other method is to change the wake oscillator model from low order to high order however it should also be noted that a high order model will have more empirical parameters which can increase the output uncertainty of the numerical model credit

on the warning limits in production phase even though the production phase also possesses a large potential of major accident risk due to the lop of the vessel in ultra deep water in accordance with the serious incident reports on the flexible risers for the norwegian continental shelf ncs during 1995 2013 4subsea 2013 one of the six incidents in the southern north sea was caused by the lop of vessel inducing a heavy load to the flexible riser resulting in turret pipe failure and eventually gas release it is indispensable to determine the warning limits of the dynamically positioned vessel in the production phase for oil development in ultra deep water in accordance with dnv rp e307 dnvgl 2015 the warning limits of the mobile offshore drilling unit modu should be determined through the rig s riser drift off analysis for a variety of environmental conditions it is necessary to investigate the relationship between the environmental loads and warning limits on the other hand when the fpso drifts off the flexible jumper as an important link between the das system and fpso for the output of oil and gas can exacerbate the drift due to the sailing effect or on the contrary can inhibit the drift due to the recovery force the design parameters with respect to the flexible jumper such as flexible jumper length fpso offset as well as artificial seabed location have the potential to influence the warning limits as well it is noteworthy that the flexible jumper length is determined by the fpso offsets and artificial seabed locations in the existing approach zhen et al 2018 therefore it is also necessary to study the influence of the design parameters on the warning limits to facilitate the design improvement of the system in turn therefore this study aims at establishing criteria of drift off warning limits for dynamically positioned fpso and das coupling system to facilitate the operator s decision making in the lop scenario the warning limits determination is on the basis of a dynamic drift off analysis of the fpso and das coupling system the correlative influence factors consisting of the wave wind and current conditions different flexible jumper lengths fpso offsets as well as artificial seabed locations are systematically investigated 1 3 relevant works existing studies have provided insight into the drift off scenario for dynamically positioned vessel from three main aspects i e root causes identification failure frequency determination and quantitative warning limits determination the studies which aim to identifying the root causes of the drift off for dynamically positioned vessel are mainly focus on establishing the lop incidents scenarios chen et al 2008 developed a safety model of the dp drilling operation based on the barrier theory and recommended the relevant risk reduction measures to strengthen each barrier element pil 2018 conducted an inductive content analysis to determine the main causes of the most common failures of dp system leading to lop incidents based on the incident data from international marine contractors association imca and dynamic positioning committee dpc hauff 2014 analyzed the drift off and drive off incidents and accidents to identify the dominant causal factors and described the accident mechanism using the bayesian network risk modelling methods are generally utilized to estimate the failure probability liu and abrahamsen 2010 studied the risk of riser operation on dp operation units using event tree combined with fault tree method to estimate the blowout frequency given the frequency of initial event drift off or drive off nie et al 2019 proposed a novel approach based on dynamic bayesian network and go model to dynamically analyze the variation of riser emergency disconnection risk over time in different stages the approaches of quantitative warning limits determination can be grouped into three main categories i e empirical method non coupled drift off analysis and fully coupled drift off analysis the empirical method is to set a constant limit based on a certain percentage of water depth rustad et al 2012 it is usually too conservative and subjective for neglecting the characteristics of the vessel and riser system the non coupled analysis approach bhalla and cao 2005 determines the vessel s trajectory as a function of time first and then uses this function as the top boundary condition of the riser system for static or dynamic analysis however this approach disregards the impacts of the riser system on the motion of the vessel such as the drag and inertia of the riser as well as the recovery force of the riser on the vessel in view of this the fully coupled analysis method is proposed to take into account the interactions between the riser system and the vessel gao 2014 liu et al 2016 1 4 structure of paper the rest of paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the theory and associated functions of the dynamic drift off analysis of the coupled fpso das system section 3 describes the validation of the fully coupled drift off analysis by conducting a case study of the fpso and das system section 4 presents the influences of the environmental load flexible jumper length fpso offset and artificial seabed location on the warning limits respectively 2 principle and formula 2 1 principle of warning limits determination when the fpso loses the power to maintain its position it will be forced by the environmental loads and move away disconnection between the fpso and the das system should be conducted before any damage occurs to the system there are three key points relative to this disconnection which divide the moving range of the fpso into four zones according to the level of danger as depicted in fig 2 the fpso stays in the green zone during the normal operation if the fpso starts to move and pass the yellow limit the situation becomes more dangerous and the operator should prepare for eds when the vessel moves further away and reaches the red limit the eds should be executed to ensure the disconnection is completed before the vessel reaches the physical limit it can also be seen from fig 2 that the physical limit is determined by the vessel s trajectory and associated time to failure the red limit and yellow limit correspond to the points of eds initiation and preparation respectively and the two limits are determined through the backward deduction of fpso s trajectory time required for eds and its preparation are related to operating rules and operators and the time should be determined in advance for different situation this paper sets the recommended time for eds and its preparation as 40s and 45s api 2017 oil gas uk 2014 the fpso s trajectory and associated time to failure can be determined through the dynamic response analysis of the coupled fpso das system 2 2 governing equation it is assumed the artificial seabed are rigid and undergo six independent degrees of motion three translational and three rotational the governing equation of the translational and rotational motion for the artificial seabed is written as follows 1 m x buo i c i x buo i f jum i f ris i f tet i f buo f env i 2 i j ϕ buo j c j ϕ buo j r j ϕ buo j m jum j m ris j m tet j m env j where the subscripts i 1 2 3 refer to the components of surge sway heave respectively x is the translational motion along different axes m is the mass of artificial seabed c is the damping term f jum is the response force of the flexible jumper at the connection point between the flexible jumper and fpso f ris f tet and f env are the response forces of the rigid risers taut tethers and environmental loads respectively f buo is the buoyance of artificial seabed the subscripts j 1 2 3 refer to the components of roll pitch yaw respectively ϕ is the rotational motion along different axes i is the total moment of inertia r is the righting moment of artificial seabed m is the response moment of flexible jumper rigid risers taut tethers and environmental loads respectively the flexible jumper which is connect to the artificial seabed is treated as a single layer pipe with equivalent bending stiffness ei the governing equation of the flexible jumper is written as 3 e i 2 α s 2 sec α w f buo q s 0 s f env n sec α sec 2 α d α d s 0 ξ f env n sin α f env t cos α d ξ d s f eff tan α q where α is the angle with respect to the horizontal line along the flexible jumper and it is determined by the fpso offsets artificial seabed location and flexible jumper length s and ξ are the coordinate of arch length of flexible jumper ranging from 0 to the total length l f env is the environmental force according to the morison equation and the subscript t n refer to the tangential and normal components respectively w is the wet weight per unit length f eff and q are the effective tension and shear force respectively the effective tension is expressed by 4 f eff t a o p o a i p i 5 t e a o a i ε where t is the actual tension of the flexible jumper a o and a i are the external and internal cross sectional areas of the riser respectively p o and p i are the corresponding fluid pressures respectively ε is the strain eq 4 and eq 5 are also applicable to rigid risers the dynamic configuration of the flexible jumper is obtained from eq 3 let δα δf eff and δq be respectively small perturbations of the variables α f eff and q therefore the total response of the flexible jumper is expressed by 6 α total α α f eff total f eff f eff q total q q the dynamic

t 2 where u is the displacement caused by perturbations at s the artificial seabed is restrained on the other side by the rigid risers and taut tethers the slender vertical riser in deep waters undergoes deformation due to its weight buoy motion and environmental loads different from the flexible jumper the stability of rigid risers is maintained by the residual buoyancy of the artificial seabed the governing equation of the rigid riser is written as 8 2 z 2 e i 2 δ z 2 f eff 2 δ z 2 q δ z w 2 δ t 2 f env where δ is the deflection along the rigid riser the boundary conditions of rigid riser and taut tether at the bottom side are given by δ 0 the dynamic responses of fpso are treated as the boundary conditions of eq 3 and eq 7 and the corresponding governing equations of fpso are given by 9 m x buo i c i x buo i f jum i f buo f dp f env i i j ϕ buo j c j ϕ buo j r j ϕ buo j m jum j m dp j m env j where the subscript dp stands for the response force and moment provided by dp system with the value of zero in the drift off scenario the motion amplitudes of fpso and flexible jumper become large when the dp system fails it is noteworthy that the conventional linearization assumptions are not available in the drift off scenario the coupled equations are nonlinear and should be solved by numerical scheme in this paper the finite element method is applied for solving the coupled equations 3 case study 3 1 warning limits determination to determine the physical limit dynamic drift off analysis of the coupled fpso das system is conducted by numerical simulations in orcaflex orcina 2016 basic parameters of the coupled fpso das system and the associated surface environmental force are tabulated in table 1 and table 2 respectively a polar coordinate system with the artificial seabed location as the origin is used to describe the basic parameters and the environmental loads it is assumed the load directions of the wind wave and current loads are consistent in this simulation both the first order and second order wave loads are concerned the physical limit and time to failure can be first determined by monitoring the critical parameters of the coupled fpso das system if any critical parameter in the system exceeds the allowable value the system fails in view of the potential structural damage to the system four critical parameters are identified to assess whether the system is failed as listed in table 3 the maximum effective tension met and minimum bend radius mbr are critical parameters to determine whether the structural damage occurs to flexible jumper while the maximum effective stress mes and maximum compression strain mcs are critical parameters for rigid riser fig 3 illustrates the time histories of the critical parameters it can be seen from fig 3 that the mbr of flexible jumper reaches the allowable value first with a significant increase trend the met of flexible jumper also increases with the fpso s drift however the two critical parameters of rigid riser have little variation due to the de coupling effect of flexible jumper zhen et al 2018 the drift off warning limits of fpso are illustrated in fig 4 for different load directions with respect to the 1 year condition sea state the positions of warning limits are expressed by polar coordinates it can be seen from fig 4 that the safe area of fpso circled by the yellow limit is in a butterfly shape and the gap of nearly a quarter of a circle is due to the fixed connection between the flexible jumper and artificial seabed using a bend stiffener it should be noted that for most of the load directions the warning limits are located at the far end relative to the artificial seabed because the mbr failure of the flexible jumper which occurs at the connection between the flexible jumper and bend stiffener is caused by the over straightening of the flexible jumper however in the load direction 180 when the fpso moves close to the artificial seabed the warning limits are located at the near end relative to the artificial seabed because the mbr failure which occurs at the overhanging point of the flexible jumper is caused by the overbending of the flexible jumper it is also noteworthy that the warning limits are densely clustered near 0 for load directions less than 90 whereas for load directions greater than or equal to 90 the points are more dispersed the reason is that due to the streamlined design of the bow the vertical drift forces are much smaller than horizontal components when the fpso heads the wave yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 and the quadratic transfer function data of sway for load directions less than 90 are much smaller than that in the load direction 90 3 2 coupling effect on fpso s trajectory fig 5 depicts fpso s displacement subject to the environmental loads versus its displacement subject to the combination of the environmental loads and flexible jumper it is shown that the direction of the displacement varies with the load direction the fpso drifts off constantly subjected to the environmental force without being connected to flexible jumper however when connected to the flexible jumper the fpso moves fast at the beginning over a distance then moves at a reduced speed and finally reciprocates in a certain position fig 6 illustrates the force of flexible jumper on the fpso in the horizontal to explain the reason for such a displacement change of the fpso subjected to the combined force it can be seen from fig 6 that the force of the flexible jumper on fpso varies with the load direction in the 0 degree load direction the fpso starts to be forced by the environmental loads to move towards 0 with the force of flexible jumper increases slowly in the reversed direction as the vessel moves farther the flexible jumper fails leading to a significant increase of the force and finally the force oscillates steadily in the 180 degree load direction the fpso begins to drift towards 180 due to the environmental loads with the force of flexible jumper decreasing in the same direction when the force of flexible jumper is decreased to zero the flexible jumper starts to push the vessel back to prevent it from moving farther the pushback force increases slowly at the beginning then increases significantly when the flexible jumper fails and finally the pushback force oscillates steadily this reveals that the flexible jumper can either inhibit or facilitate the fpso s moving thus a fully coupled analysis of the fpso and das coupling system is necessary 4 influence factors analysis in accordance with the dynamic drift off analysis of the coupled fpso das system the environmental loads affect the warning limits through the magnitude and direction of the wind wave and current loads respectively whereas the design parameters associated with the flexible jumper affects the warning limits through the shape changing of the flexible jumper to explain the relationships between the correlative influence factors and the warning limits a sensitivity analysis of these factors is conducted the varying range of these factors are tabulated in table 4 4 1 influence of environmental loads on the warning limits figs 7 9 depict the drift off warning limits of fpso based on the polar coordinate system for different load directions wind velocities wave heights and current velocities respectively it can be seen from figs 7 9 that the angle coordinate or angle of the warning limit is mainly determined by the load direction the wind velocity has little effect on the warning limit and the wave height and current velocity have limited influence on the physical limit but significant influence on the red and yellow limits this reveals the physical limit of fpso is mainly determined by the characteristics of the coupled fpso das system while the red limit and yellow limit are determined by the combination of the environmental loads and the characteristics of the coupled fpso das system the radius coordinate or radius of the red limit decreases as the wave height increases because greater environmental load will increase the speed of fpso thus increasing the travel distance of fpso from the red limit to the physical limit the wave height has a similar influence on the yellow limit meanwhile the influences of current velocity on the red and yellow limits are consistent with the wave height as illustrated in fig 9 figs 10 12 depict the time to failure for different wind velocities wave heights and current velocities respectively it is shown in figs 10 12 that the wind velocity has little effect on the time to failure whereas the wave height and current velocity have more significant influences on the time to failure the time to failure is long when the wave height is virtually zero 0 and 25 1 year condition cases this indicates that the second order wave force has a significant contribution to the fpso s drift in general the time to failure decreases with the increase of the wave height and current velocity it is noteworthy that except for the small wave height cases 0 or 25 1 year condition cases the time to failure is maximum at 90 degree load direction due to long travel distance and short horizontal drift force of the fpso 4 2 influence of flexible jumper on the warning limits fig 13 15 depict the warning limits of fpso for different flexible jumper lengths fpso offsets and artificial seabed locations respectively fig 16 18 depict the associated time to failure for different flexible jumper lengths fpso offsets and artificial seabed locations respectively it can be seen from fig 13 and fig 16 that the increase of flexible jumper length will increase the radius of each warning limit and the time to failure because the travel distance of fpso for straightening the flexible jumper is increased for the same reason the increase of the fpso offset increases the time to failure for the load direction greater than 90 whereas reduces the time to failure for the load directions less than or equal to 90 it can be seen from fig 15 and fig 18 that the increase of artificial seabed location reduces the time to straighten the flexible jumper thus reducing the radius of each warning limit and time to failure for load directions 0 157 5 however for the 180 degree load direction the increase of artificial seabed location results in opposite effect on the radius of each warning limit and time to failure because the increase of artificial seabed location will increase the travel distance of fpso required to overbend the flexible jumper in view of the mbr failure due to excessive bending of the of flexible jumper 4 3 importance of the influence factors the tornado diagram is used to sort the influence extents of the influence factors on the physical red and yellow limits as well as time to failure as illustrated in fig 19 21 it is shown in fig 19 that the flexible jumper length has the most significant influence on the radius of each warning limit followed by the environmental load direction the wave height and fpso offset have small effects on the physical limit while they have more significant effects on the red and yellow limits due to their influences on the time to failure it is noteworthy that the wind velocity has little influence on the warning limit and time to failure it is shown in fig 20 that the angle of each warning limit is mainly determined by the environmental load direction it can also be seen from fig 21 that the wave height has the most significant influence on the time to failure 5 conclusion and discussion this study focuses on determining the drift off warning limits for the coupled fpso das system to promote the safety control of dp operation during the production phase a dynamic drift off analysis method of the das system and fpso is conducted with the effectiveness verified in the case study of the coupled fpso das system the influence factors associated with the environmental loads and shape of flexible jumper are investigated to study the characteristics of the warning limits main conclusions can be summarized as follows in comparison with the disconnected fpso which drifts off constantly subject to the environmental force fpso coupled to the das system is subject to the impact of flexible jumper during the drift off process which can either facilitate or inhibit the drift of fpso depending on the moving direction of fpso therefore it is necessary to conduct fully coupled analysis of the fpso and das system for the determination of warning limits the warning limits are mainly located at two positions i e the far end and the near end relative to the artificial seabed depending on the direction of environmental loads for most of the load directions the warning limits are located at the far end due to the mbr failure occurring at the connection between flexible jumper and the bend stiffener however for the 180 degree load direction the warning limits are located at the near end due to the mbr failure occurring at the overhanging point of the flexible jumper for this reason whether the fpso moving in a direction away from or close to the artificial seabed there is a potential failure which requires the operator s attention besides the safe area of fpso is in a butterfly shape due to the design characteristics of the das system the three main aspects of warning limits can be affected by the influence factors i e the angle and radius of the warning limits as well as the time to failure the environmental loads direction and flexible jumper length have the most significant influence on the warning limits from the aspects of angle and radius respectively meanwhile the wave height has the most significant effect on the time to failure it is noteworthy that even though the wave height and fpso offset have limited influence on the physical limit they will significantly affect the red and yellow limit due to the significant influences on the time to failure besides due to the characteristics of the second order wave force on fpso the warning limits are densely clustered near the 0 for load directions less than 90 the increase of the flexible jumper length will increase the radiuses of the warning limits and time to failure which enlarges the safe moving range of fpso and increases the reaction time for preventive and contingency operation in contrast to the flexible jumper length the increase of the artificial seabed location will decrease the radiuses of the warning limits and time to failure 180 degree load direction is excluded but it will reduce the impact of surface environmental loads on the das system therefore it is necessary to balance the trade off between the safety reduction and increase associated with the flexible jumper length and artificial seabed location this study provides a useful tool for the decision making of dp operations in a drift off scenario and contributes to the safety control of the dp operation in the production phase credit authorship contribution statement yue han conceptualization methodology software formal analysis data

dynamically positioned vessel from three main aspects i e root causes identification failure frequency determination and quantitative warning limits determination the studies which aim to identifying the root causes of the drift off for dynamically positioned vessel are mainly focus on establishing the lop incidents scenarios chen et al 2008 developed a safety model of the dp drilling operation based on the barrier theory and recommended the relevant risk reduction measures to strengthen each barrier element pil 2018 conducted an inductive content analysis to determine the main causes of the most common failures of dp system leading to lop incidents based on the incident data from international marine contractors association imca and dynamic positioning committee dpc hauff 2014 analyzed the drift off and drive off incidents and accidents to identify the dominant causal factors and described the accident mechanism using the bayesian network risk modelling methods are generally utilized to estimate the failure probability liu and abrahamsen 2010 studied the risk of riser operation on dp operation units using event tree combined with fault tree method to estimate the blowout frequency given the frequency of initial event drift off or drive off nie et al 2019 proposed a novel approach based on dynamic bayesian network and go model to dynamically analyze the variation of riser emergency disconnection risk over time in different stages the approaches of quantitative warning limits determination can be grouped into three main categories i e empirical method non coupled drift off analysis and fully coupled drift off analysis the empirical method is to set a constant limit based on a certain percentage of water depth rustad et al 2012 it is usually too conservative and subjective for neglecting the characteristics of the vessel and riser system the non coupled analysis approach bhalla and cao 2005 determines the vessel s trajectory as a function of time first and then uses this function as the top boundary condition of the riser system for static or dynamic analysis however this approach disregards the impacts of the riser system on the motion of the vessel such as the drag and inertia of the riser as well as the recovery force of the riser on the vessel in view of this the fully coupled analysis method is proposed to take into account the interactions between the riser system and the vessel gao 2014 liu et al 2016 1 4 structure of paper the rest of paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the theory and associated functions of the dynamic drift off analysis of the coupled fpso das system section 3 describes the validation of the fully coupled drift off analysis by conducting a case study of the fpso and das system section 4 presents the influences of the environmental load flexible jumper length fpso offset and artificial seabed location on the warning limits respectively 2 principle and formula 2 1 principle of warning limits determination when the fpso loses the power to maintain its position it will be forced by the environmental loads and move away disconnection between the fpso and the das system should be conducted before any damage occurs to the system there are three key points relative to this disconnection which divide the moving range of the fpso into four zones according to the level of danger as depicted in fig 2 the fpso stays in the green zone during the normal operation if the fpso starts to move and pass the yellow limit the situation becomes more dangerous and the operator should prepare for eds when the vessel moves further away and reaches the red limit the eds should be executed to ensure the disconnection is completed before the vessel reaches the physical limit it can also be seen from fig 2 that the physical limit is determined by the vessel s trajectory and associated time to failure the red limit and yellow limit correspond to the points of eds initiation and preparation respectively and the two limits are determined through the backward deduction of fpso s trajectory time required for eds and its preparation are related to operating rules and operators and the time should be determined in advance for different situation this paper sets the recommended time for eds and its preparation as 40s and 45s api 2017 oil gas uk 2014 the fpso s trajectory and associated time to failure can be determined through the dynamic response analysis of the coupled fpso das system 2 2 governing equation it is assumed the artificial seabed are rigid and undergo six independent degrees of motion three translational and three rotational the governing equation of the translational and rotational motion for the artificial seabed is written as follows 1 m x buo i c i x buo i f jum i f ris i f tet i f buo f env i 2 i j ϕ buo j c j ϕ buo j r j ϕ buo j m jum j m ris j m tet j m env j where the subscripts i 1 2 3 refer to the components of surge sway heave respectively x is the translational motion along different axes m is the mass of artificial seabed c is the damping term f jum is the response force of the flexible jumper at the connection point

subscripts j 1 2 3 refer to the components of roll pitch yaw respectively ϕ is the rotational motion along different axes i is the total moment of inertia r is the righting moment of artificial seabed m is the response moment of flexible jumper rigid risers taut tethers and environmental loads respectively the flexible jumper which is connect to the artificial seabed is treated as a single layer pipe with equivalent bending stiffness ei the governing equation of the flexible jumper is written as 3 e i 2 α s 2 sec α w f buo q s 0 s f env n sec α sec 2 α d α d s 0 ξ f env n sin α f env t cos α d ξ d s f eff tan α q where α is the angle with respect to the horizontal line along the flexible jumper and it is determined by the fpso offsets artificial seabed location and flexible jumper length

corresponding fluid pressures respectively ε is the strain eq 4 and eq 5 are also applicable to rigid risers the dynamic configuration of the flexible jumper is obtained from eq 3 let δα δf eff and δq

t 2 where u is the displacement caused by perturbations at s the artificial seabed is restrained on the other side by the rigid risers and taut tethers the slender vertical riser in deep waters undergoes deformation due to its weight buoy motion and environmental loads different from the flexible jumper the stability of rigid risers is maintained by the residual buoyancy of the artificial seabed the governing equation of the rigid riser is written as 8 2 z 2 e i 2 δ z 2 f eff 2 δ z 2 q δ z w 2 δ t 2 f env where δ is the deflection along the rigid riser the boundary conditions of rigid riser and taut tether at the bottom side are given by δ 0 the dynamic responses of fpso are treated as the boundary conditions of eq 3 and eq 7 and the corresponding governing equations of fpso are given by 9 m x buo i c i x buo i f jum i f buo f dp f env i i j ϕ buo j c j ϕ buo j r j ϕ buo j m jum j m dp j m env j where the subscript dp stands for the response force and moment provided by dp system with the value of zero in the drift off scenario the motion amplitudes of fpso and flexible jumper become large when the dp system fails it is noteworthy that the conventional linearization assumptions are not available in the drift off scenario the coupled equations are nonlinear and should be solved by numerical scheme in this paper the finite element method is applied for solving the coupled equations 3 case study 3 1 warning limits determination to determine the physical limit dynamic drift off analysis of the coupled fpso das system is conducted by numerical simulations in orcaflex orcina 2016 basic parameters of the coupled fpso das system and the associated surface environmental force are tabulated in table 1 and table 2 respectively a polar coordinate system with the artificial seabed location as the origin is used to describe the basic parameters and the environmental loads it is assumed the load directions of the wind wave and current loads are consistent in this simulation both the first order and second order wave loads are concerned the physical limit and time to failure can be first determined by monitoring the critical parameters of the coupled fpso das system if any critical parameter in the system exceeds the allowable value the system fails in view of the potential structural damage to the system four critical parameters are identified to assess whether the system is failed as listed in table 3 the maximum effective tension met and minimum bend radius mbr are critical parameters to determine whether the structural damage occurs to flexible jumper while the maximum effective stress mes and maximum compression strain mcs are critical parameters for rigid riser fig 3 illustrates the time histories of the critical parameters it can be seen from fig 3 that the mbr of flexible jumper reaches the allowable value first with a significant increase trend the met of flexible jumper also increases with the fpso s drift however the two critical parameters of rigid riser have little variation due to the de coupling effect of flexible jumper zhen et al 2018 the drift off warning limits of fpso are illustrated in fig 4 for different load directions with respect to the 1 year condition sea state the positions of warning limits are expressed by polar coordinates it can be seen from fig 4 that the safe area of fpso circled by the yellow limit is in a butterfly shape and the gap of nearly a quarter of a circle is due to the fixed connection between the flexible jumper and artificial seabed using a bend stiffener it should be noted that for most of the load directions the warning limits are located at the far end relative to the artificial seabed because the mbr failure of the flexible jumper which occurs at the connection between the flexible jumper and bend stiffener is caused by the over straightening of the flexible jumper however in the load direction 180 when the fpso moves close to the artificial seabed the warning limits are located at the near end relative to the artificial seabed because the mbr failure which occurs at the overhanging point of the flexible jumper is caused by the overbending of the flexible jumper it is also noteworthy that the warning limits are densely clustered near 0 for load directions less than 90 whereas for load directions greater than or equal to 90 the points are more dispersed the reason is that due to the streamlined design of the bow the vertical drift forces are much smaller than horizontal components when the fpso heads the wave yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 and the quadratic transfer function data of sway for load directions less than 90 are much smaller than that in the load direction 90 3 2 coupling effect on fpso s trajectory fig 5 depicts fpso s displacement subject to the environmental loads versus its displacement subject to the combination of the environmental loads and flexible jumper it is shown that the direction of the displacement varies with the load direction the fpso drifts off constantly subjected to the environmental force without being connected to flexible jumper however when connected to the flexible jumper the fpso moves fast at the beginning over a distance then moves at a reduced speed and finally reciprocates in a certain position fig 6 illustrates the force of flexible jumper on the fpso in the horizontal to explain the reason for such a displacement change of the fpso subjected to the combined force it can be seen from fig 6 that the force of the flexible jumper on fpso varies with the load direction in the 0 degree load direction the fpso starts to be forced by the environmental loads to move towards 0 with the force of flexible jumper increases slowly in the reversed direction as the vessel moves farther the flexible jumper fails leading to a significant increase of the force and finally the force oscillates steadily in the 180 degree load direction the fpso begins to drift towards 180 due to the environmental loads with the force of flexible jumper decreasing in the same direction when the force of flexible jumper is decreased to zero the flexible jumper starts to push the vessel back to prevent it from moving farther the pushback force increases slowly at the beginning then increases significantly when the flexible jumper fails and finally the pushback force oscillates steadily this reveals that the flexible jumper can either inhibit or facilitate the fpso s moving thus a fully coupled analysis of the fpso and das coupling system is necessary 4 influence factors analysis in accordance with the dynamic drift off analysis of the coupled fpso das system the environmental loads affect the warning limits through the magnitude and direction of the wind wave and current loads respectively whereas the design parameters associated with the flexible jumper affects the warning limits through the shape changing of the flexible jumper to explain the relationships between the correlative influence factors and the warning limits a sensitivity analysis of these factors is conducted the varying range of these factors are tabulated in table 4 4 1 influence of environmental loads on the warning limits figs 7 9 depict the drift off warning limits of fpso based on the polar coordinate system for different load directions wind velocities wave heights and current velocities respectively it can be seen from figs 7 9 that the angle coordinate or angle of the warning limit is mainly determined by the load direction the wind velocity has little effect on the warning limit and the wave height and current velocity have limited influence on the physical limit but significant influence on the red and yellow limits this reveals the physical limit of fpso is mainly determined by the characteristics of the coupled fpso das system while the red limit and yellow limit are determined by the combination of the environmental loads and the characteristics of the coupled fpso das system the radius coordinate or radius of the red limit decreases as the wave height increases because greater environmental load will increase the speed of fpso thus increasing the travel distance of fpso from the red limit to the physical limit the wave height has a similar influence on the yellow limit meanwhile the influences of current velocity on the red and yellow limits are consistent with the wave height as illustrated in fig 9 figs 10 12 depict the time to failure for different wind velocities wave heights and current velocities respectively it is shown in figs 10 12 that the wind velocity has little effect on the time to failure whereas the wave height and current velocity have more significant influences on the time to failure the time to failure is long when the wave height is virtually zero 0 and 25 1 year condition cases this indicates that the second order wave force has a significant contribution to the fpso s drift in general the time to failure decreases with the increase of the wave height and current velocity it is noteworthy that except for the small wave height cases 0 or 25 1 year condition cases the time to failure is maximum at 90 degree load direction due to long travel distance and short horizontal drift force of the fpso 4 2 influence of flexible jumper on the warning limits fig 13 15 depict the warning limits of fpso for different flexible jumper lengths fpso offsets and artificial seabed locations respectively fig 16 18 depict the associated time to failure for different flexible jumper lengths fpso offsets and artificial seabed locations respectively it can be seen from fig 13 and fig 16 that the increase of flexible jumper length will increase the radius of each warning limit and the time to failure because the travel distance of fpso for straightening the flexible jumper is increased for the same reason the increase of the fpso offset increases the time to failure for the load direction greater than 90 whereas reduces the time to failure for the load directions less than or equal to 90 it can be seen from fig 15 and fig 18 that the increase of artificial seabed location reduces the time to straighten the flexible jumper thus reducing the radius of each warning limit and time to failure for load directions 0 157 5 however for the 180 degree load direction the increase of artificial seabed location results in opposite effect on the radius of each warning limit and time to failure because the increase of artificial seabed location will increase the travel distance of fpso required to overbend the flexible jumper in view of the mbr failure due to excessive bending of the of flexible jumper 4 3 importance of the influence factors the tornado diagram is used to sort the influence extents of the influence factors on the physical red and yellow limits as well as time to failure as illustrated in fig 19 21 it is shown in fig 19 that the flexible jumper length has the most significant influence on the radius of each warning limit followed by the environmental load direction the wave height and fpso offset have small effects on the physical limit while they have more significant effects on the red and yellow limits due to their influences on the time to failure it is noteworthy that the wind velocity has little influence on the warning limit and time to failure it is shown in fig 20 that the angle of each warning limit is mainly determined by the environmental load direction it can also be seen from fig 21 that the wave height has the most significant influence on the time to failure 5 conclusion and discussion this study focuses on determining the drift off warning limits for the coupled fpso das system to promote the safety control of dp operation during the production phase a dynamic drift off analysis method of the das system and fpso is conducted with the effectiveness verified in the case study of the coupled fpso das system the influence factors associated with the environmental loads and shape of flexible jumper are investigated to study the characteristics of the warning limits main conclusions can be summarized as follows in comparison with the disconnected fpso which drifts off constantly subject to the environmental force fpso coupled to the das system is subject to the impact of flexible jumper during the drift off process which can either facilitate or inhibit the drift of fpso depending on the moving direction of fpso therefore it is necessary to conduct fully coupled analysis of the fpso and das system for the determination of warning limits the warning limits are mainly located at two positions i e the far end and the near end relative to the artificial seabed depending on the direction of environmental loads for most of the load directions the warning limits are located at the far end due to the mbr failure occurring at the connection between flexible jumper and the bend stiffener however for the 180 degree load direction the warning limits are located at the near end due to the mbr failure occurring at the overhanging point of the flexible jumper for this reason whether the fpso moving in a direction away from or close to the artificial seabed there is a potential failure which requires the operator s attention besides the safe area of fpso is in a butterfly shape due to the design characteristics of the das system the three main aspects of warning limits can be affected by the influence factors i e the angle and radius of the warning limits as well as the time to failure the environmental loads direction and flexible jumper length have the most significant influence on the warning limits from the aspects of angle and radius respectively meanwhile the wave height has the most significant effect on the time to failure it is noteworthy that even though the wave height and fpso offset have limited influence on the physical limit they will significantly affect the red and yellow limit due to the significant influences on the time to failure besides due to the characteristics of the second order wave force on fpso the warning limits are densely clustered near the 0 for load directions less than 90 the increase of the flexible jumper length will increase the radiuses of the warning limits and time to failure which enlarges the safe moving range of fpso and increases the reaction time for preventive and contingency operation in contrast to the flexible jumper length the increase of the artificial seabed location will decrease the radiuses of the warning limits and time to failure 180 degree load direction is excluded but it will reduce the impact of surface environmental loads on the das system therefore it is necessary to balance the trade off between the safety reduction and increase associated with the flexible jumper length and artificial seabed location this study provides a useful tool for the decision making of dp operations in a drift off scenario and contributes to the safety control of the dp operation in the production phase credit authorship contribution statement yue han conceptualization methodology software formal analysis data
