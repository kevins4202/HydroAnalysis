7355,atmospheric evaporative demand can be used as a measure of the hydrological cycle and the global energy balance its long term variation and the role of driving climatic factors have received increasingly attention in climate change studies fao penman monteith reference crop evapotranspiration rates were estimated for 644 meteorological stations over china for the period 1960 2011 to analyze spatial and temporal attribution variability attribution of climatic variables to reference crop evapotranspiration rates was not stable over the study period while for all of china the contribution of sunshine duration remained relatively stable the importance of relative humidity increased considerably during the last two decades particularly in winter spatially distributed attribution analysis shows that the position of the center of maximum contribution of sunshine duration has shifted from southeast to northeast china while in west china the contribution of wind speed has decreased dramatically in contrast relative humidity has become an important factor in most parts of china changes in the asian monsoon circulation may be responsible for altered patterns of

they directly give a reliable estimate of the actual water loss to the atmosphere however a complete investigation into the causes of actual et rates would require considering a number of factors i e

stomatal conductance reductions to increasing atmospheric co2 concentrations in general there is a fair agreement between gcm results and et0 estimates scheff and frierson 2014 while gcm experiments are based on non linear physical models the et0 formulation uses only fixed land surface parameters to simulate the effects of a crop cover on aed if results of gcm experiments do represent a fair approximation of aed this would indicate a systematic bias in aed estimates with atmospheric co2 concentration however only if century scale changes are considered do differences amount to 0 03 0 5 mm

variability of attribution patterns over several climate zones and a large latitudinal extent our objectives are i to evaluate the relationships between the driving climatic factors and et0

period 1960 2011 were provided by the climatic data center cdc of the national meteorological information center of china nmic fig 1 the dataset includes monthly mean sunshine duration sd h wind speed ws m s 1 relative humidity rh and minimum as well as maximum temperature tmx c with the exception of the extreme western western tibetan plateau and northwestern gobi and tarim basin parts of the study area the stations are equally distributed covering an elevational range of 4800 m from 2 m to 4800 m climate data were homogenized and missing values were estimated from up to 10 neighboring stations peterson et al 1998 with the r package climatol r development core and team 2004 http www climatol eu index html the homogeneity tests are applied on a difference series between the tested station and a reference series constructed as a weighted average of series from nearby stations this homogenization methodology involves three steps a type ii regression missing data estimation and outlier and break detection and correlation guijarro 2014 2 2 estimation of fao pm reference crop evapotranspiration rates the fao pm method used in this study has been widely accepted for calculating et0 allen et al 1998 in this method the land cover is defined as a hypothetical reference crop with height of 0 12 m a fixed surface resistance of 70 s m 1 and an albedo of 0 23 allen et al 1998 the fao pm equation to estimate et0 mm day 1 is given as 1 et 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where rn is the net radiation at the crop surface mj m 2 d 1 g is soil heat flux mj m 2

curve at air temperature t kpa c 1 and γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 daily et0 values were summed to monthly totals net radiation at the crop surface rn is a function of solar radiation rs with no directly measured rs available we relied on the conversion of observed sunshine duration to rs doorenbos and pruitt 1977 allen et al 1998 rs can be estimated from observed sunshine duration using the ångström formula ångström 1924 2 r s a s b s n n r a where as is the fraction of extraterrestrial radiation on overcast days as bs is the fraction of extraterrestrial radiation on clear days n is the actual duration of sunshine h n is maximum possible duration of sunshine h and ra is the extraterrestrial radiation intensity mj m 2 day 1 in order to derive solar radiation values from observed sunshine duration we performed regression analysis with directly measured solar radiation data available for a subset of 123 stations available from the national meteorological information centre of china nmic the derived ångström constants as and bs were spatially interpolated to a raster surface interpolation was performed by kriging with extended drift using elevation as auxiliary predictor and a 1 km dem dataset in arcmap 10 0 esri 2011 the as and bs values for stations without directly measured solar radiation were derived from the raster data sets at the respective station location the wind speed at 2 m above ground surface was derived from the normal measurement at 10 m based on the logarithmic wind speed profile equation given by allen et al 1998 3 methods 3 1 analysis of relationships between driving climatic factors and et0 variability the relationship between et0 rates and climatic variables was analyzed with multiple regressions on a monthly basis with et0 as dependent variable and sd ws rh and tmx as predictors using the lm function in r software variables were selected into the final model based on the lowest aikaike information criterion using stepwise backward elimination of predictors the contribution of each significant variable was determined by explained variance ev 3 2 analysis of temporal and spatial variation of attribution in order to analyze the temporal variability of the contribution of the individual climatic variables we further performed stepwise multiple regressions for moving windows of ten years width 1960 1969 1961 1970 2002 2011 which produces a time series of ev for each station we also explored the temporal and spatial patterns of ev using a multiple factor analysis mfa on monthly values this ordination technique identifies the common structure among different sets of variables defined for the same individuals escofier and pages 1994 mfa performs separate principal component analysis pca on each set of variables the elements of each set are then divided by the square root of the first eigenvalue of each pca and a global pca is then performed on the normalized data set we performed mfa for the ev time series sd ws rh and tmx for 644 stations by using the factominer package lê et al 2008 in r 3 23 r development core and team 2004 the first six factor loadings resulting from mfa were interpolated with kriging method using arcmap software version 10 0 4 results 4 1 relationships between driving climatic factors and et0 variability values for as bs and as bs range from 0 13 to 0 32 0 43 to 0 63 and 0 67 to 0 90 respectively fig 2 maximum as bs values 0 8 which indicate maximum atmospheric transmittance for very clear days are concentrated above 3000 m a s l in sw and w china our modelled as and bs values are in line with chen et al 2004 who give very similar values and a comparable spatial distribution averaged over the entire observation period 1960 2011 the four climatic factors sd ws rh and tmx accounted for almost 80 of annual et0 variation over china with higher ev in west china than in east china fig 3 in general sd explained the highest variance on average 32 with rh ws and tmx each explaining consecutively less ev table 1 at seasonal time scales spatial patterns of ev showed that sd was the most important climatic factor determining et0 rates in eastern china and during spring and summer season table 1 fig 4 a and b in contrast ws was important for et0 changes in the arid desert areas of northwest china during autumn and on the southern tibetan plateau during winter season fig 4c and d rh explained the highest variance during autumn and winter seasons average ev up to 47 while with the exception of northwestern china in spring fig 4a tmx ev remained low throughout the entire study area temporal attribution variability as shown by the all china ev time series fig 5 underlines that over the last 50 years sd always was by far the most important climatic factor explaining et0 rates with rh following on second place ws and tmx each explained slightly more than 10 while sd ev remained relatively stable rh ev experienced a rapid increase in the last two decades reaching ev similar to sd seasonal rankings however were more varied fig 6 shows a pronounced seasonal distinction between spring and summer and autumn and winter respectively spring and summer were dominated by sd explaining on average about 45 and 55 ev respectively with no distinct changes over time in autumn and winter the situation was reversed with rh explaining on average about 35 and 45 ev respectively rh ev increased continuously during the last two decades reaching the level of summer sd 4 2 temporal and spatial variation of attribution to illustrate spatial ev variability over time ev averaged over 4 time slices each covering 21 years are shown in fig 7 with the exception of tmx ev range for a given area never exceeding 20 all climatic variables showed pronounced variability in some cases with an ev range of more than 50 for a given area superimposed at large scales however sd and ws ev showed a stable bisection along a meridional line running appr at 105 e with high low ev for sd in the east west and vice versa for ws over the last 50 years the region of highest sd ev has moved northwards from the south china coast by more than 30 of latitude to extreme northeast china in a similar fashion the center of maximum ws ev moved to the south in western china but ws ev also decreased rapidly during the last two decades mfa analysis yielded 6 factors explaining a total variance of 46 out of these the first three each explained about 10 fig 8 in contrast to the spatial arrangement of the ev of the input data fig 7 most of the factors showed more zonal patterns particularly noteworthy are two linear structures in reof 2 and 6 at appr 27 n stretching through most of southeast china in contrast reof 4 showed a patchy appearance with no obvious zonal patterns 5 discussion since the first publication on et0 trends over china thomas 2000 numerous studies have confirmed that et0 trends are generally decreasing over china for a review of aed trends both in china and abroad see mcvicar et al 2012 china therefor fits in a global pattern of generally decreasing terrestrial et0 trends since china is a vast area with different climatic regions it is not surprising that spatial patterns of aed trends can be observed namely with regard to the temporal regimes of different monsoonal circulation branches aed trends however did not change monotonically during the observation period while trends mostly declined during the period 1960 1990 increasing trends were visible since the late 1990 s as reported by gao et al 2006 and zhang et al 2011a for the whole of china as well as by chen et al 2006 and zhang et al 2009 for the qinghai tibet plateau chen et al 2006 and xing et al 2016 suggest aed rates display decadal variations rather than monotonic changes this is already an indication that the climatic variables influencing et0 rates also have to vary both in temporal and spatial terms our attribution study of et0 rates in yunnan province in southwest china fan and thomas 2013 designed to analyze temporal variations of attribution has shown that attribution is highly variable over time both on an intra annual and inter annual variations level and between climatic variables seasonal variations appear to be linked to the change of properties and extent of monsoonal air masses in southwest china 5 1 relationships between driving climatic factors and et0 variability even though the decrease of sd ws and rh in general has to lead to declining et0 rates both trend magnitude and the sensitivity of et0 to meteorological variables have to be taken into account together to arrive at an understanding of the driving mechanism of et0 rates it is known that the sensitivity of et0 to meteorological variables also varies spatially fig 4 gong et al 2006 yin et al 2010b zhang et al 2011b the decline of sunshine duration global dimming is the main driving force for et0 decrease in tropical and subtropical china which is consistent with the finding from subtropical and tropical humid region of china yin et al 2010b stanhill and cohen 2001 in southeast china the increase of aerosol concentrations accompanied with urbanization resulted in a decrease of net radiation that led to decreases in et0 rates liu et al 2004 zhang et al 2011a lower ws stilling is the main cause of declining et0 rates in northwest china fig 4 which may be attributed to declining ws trends being higher in north china then in south china and being higher in winter than in summer xu et al 2006b wang et al 2007 guo et al 2011 zheng and wang 2014 the marked decrease of ws ev during the last five decades may be linked to a diminished monsoon circulation wang et al 2004 rh was found to be most sensitive variable explaining et0 rates in the yangtze river basin gong et al 2006 our data however show no remarkable connection between rh and et0 rates in this region as with the exception of the immediate coastal region moderate negative rh trends combine with low ev tmx always explained less than 25 of et0 rates in the agricultural important yangtze river basin tmx ev even reached the lowest values in all of china indicating almost no influence on et0 rates although warm temperatures induce et0 to increase mostly by lowering rh and providing energy input to the evaporating surface temperature effects on et0 rates were negligible compared to other factors yin et al 2010b 5 2 temporal and spatial variation of attribution the above cited studies were all based on average values over their respective study periods and have not considered temporal changes of the relative importance of climatic variables for et0 in a pilot study in yunnan province in southwest china we found that the attribution of climatic variables to et0 rates was not stable fan and thomas 2013 all china ev time series figs 5 and 6 show both long term trends such as a gradual rise and fall in sd ev but also decadal scale changes such as the rapid rise of rh ev since the late 1990s may in winter both sd and rh are directly influenced by changes in precipitation and cloudiness so varying ev values point to altered circulation patterns sea surface temperature and enso regimes are drivers of precipitation in east china ren et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 with increased winter precipitation in south china since 1993 as reported by ren et al 2016 both may have contributed to observed sd and rh ev changes spatial sd ws and to lesser extent rh ev patterns show a meridional division between east and west china at appr 100 105 e fig 7 this is a well known climatic division in south china between indian and chinese monsoon areas zhang 1988 that further north defines the extent of the influence of maritime monsoonal air masses in china domrös and peng 1988 this bisection is again an indication that the large scale circulation is mirrored in spatial ev patterns cloudiness and atmospheric water vapour content in eastern china control sd while predominantly dry and cloudless conditions in western china favor ws as dominant driver our finding is in line with taban and talaee 2014 who found that sd and ws dominate as drivers of et in humid and arid climates respectively we applied mfa to evaluate if an underlying spatial organization of ev can be found fig 8 mfa reveals three major spatial patterns reof 1 reof 3 that each explains about 10 of the total variance perhaps the most striking feature is the almost complete absence of the meridional division between east and west china visible in sd and ws ev in fig 7 instead a zonal arrangement is apparent reof 2 shows this zonal pattern more clearly with a distinct band of high values along appr 27 n in southeast china both reof 3 and reof 6 show a sharp transition in the same region this coincides with the region where most of the meiyu rainbands are initiated xu et al 2009 a seasonal precipitation belt that forms in early summer in southeast china precipitation and cloudiness as drivers of sd again point to the summer monsoon circulation as a possible decisive factor compared to reof 1 reof 3 the patchy pattern of reof 4 is an indicator of the influence of local factors which often are related to orography this might indicate regions where orographic obstacles lead to cloud formation and dissipation on windward and leeward slopes resp even though reof 4 bears only a superficial resemblance to an orographic map of china low values in particular follow large scale depression such as the tarim and tengger desert basins in northwest china and the yangtze river valley in southeast china for the allocation of water resources in the dominant rice growing areas of south china but also for the irrigation planning in the wheat growing areas in north china understanding and modelling the future amount and spatial distribution of et rates is of crucial importance et0 rates estimated from gcm results e g mo et al 2013 prudhomme and williamson 2013 xing et al 2014 are a key component for crop water balance calculations given our results gcm et0 rates based on formulations that do not include the effects of wind on et have to be regarded with caution particularly in arid climates where wind speeds dominate attribution taban and talaee 2014 et0 rates in temperature based models will depend mainly on the increasing temperature signal and consequently display rising instead of decreasing et0 rates such as in terink et al 2013 attribution of climatic variables can be considered a useful tool to verify if the underlying physics of a gcm model are able to reproduce the dependencies between et0 rates and forcing climatic variables validation of gcm based et0 rates should therefore not only be able to reproduce the spatial organization of et0 rates but also the spatio temporal patterns of attribution for century scale studies an adaption of the stomatal conductance value in the fao pm method to rising atmospheric co2 concentrations would have to be considered milly and dunne 2016 besides finding that large uncertainties exist in future et0 projections using different gcms xu et al 2014 also note that the sensitivity of et0 based on gcm data in the baseline period is very different from that based on observations indicating that the regional climate model did fail to preserve the sensitivity of et0 in the baseline period even though the sensitivity of their simulated data in the future period was similar to that in the baseline period it is obvious that in such a case the resulting projections should be seen with caution 6 conclusion even though temperatures have increased et0 and observed epan rates have in general been declining during the last decades both in china and on a global scale this contradicts the notion that et0 rates should increase in a warming climate decline of solar radiation rates global dimming and wind speeds stilling have been shown to be the main cause for decreased et0 rates the attribution of the four climatic variables sd ws rh and tmx to et0 rates in china varies geographically and on a seasonal basis maximum annual sd and ws ev are restricted to east and west china respectively while rh shows an irregular pattern of moderate ev with the exception of northwest china tmx ev are low throughout the study area we inferred that the east west division of sd and ws ev are the result of the monsoonal circulation with cloudiness governing sd variability in humid east china and ws dominating under mostly cloudless skies in arid west china the temporal evolution of annual evs shows that with the exception of the last years sd ev always ranked highest and decreased only slightly during the last decade in contrast rh ev experienced a rapid increase during the last two decades and reached sd levels in the last years due to an increase in winter ws and tmx evs remained on a low level and decreased slowly over the study period an analysis of the temporal patterns of circulation parameters over east asia vs ev values should allow distinguishing the underlying causes of the observed changes our results confirm that estimating et0 rates with simple temperature based estimation methods and without taking into account ws will likely give unreliable results particularly in arid climates for et0 estimates derived from gcm data

observed sunshine duration we performed regression analysis with directly measured solar radiation data available for a subset of 123 stations available from the national meteorological information centre of china nmic the derived ångström constants as and bs were spatially interpolated to a raster surface interpolation was performed by kriging with extended drift using elevation as auxiliary predictor and a 1 km dem dataset in arcmap 10 0 esri 2011 the as and bs values for stations without directly measured solar radiation were derived from the raster data sets at the respective station location the wind speed at 2 m above ground surface was derived from the normal measurement at 10 m based on the logarithmic wind speed profile equation given by allen et al 1998 3 methods 3 1 analysis of relationships between driving climatic factors and et0 variability the relationship between et0 rates and climatic variables was analyzed with multiple regressions on a monthly basis with et0 as dependent variable and sd ws rh and tmx as predictors using the lm function in r software variables were selected into the final model based on the lowest aikaike information criterion using stepwise backward elimination of predictors the contribution of each significant variable was determined by explained variance ev 3 2 analysis of temporal and spatial variation of attribution in order to analyze the temporal variability of the contribution of the individual climatic variables we further performed stepwise multiple regressions for moving windows of ten years width 1960 1969 1961 1970 2002 2011 which produces a time series of ev for each station we also explored the temporal and spatial patterns of ev using a multiple factor analysis mfa on monthly values this ordination technique identifies the common structure among different sets of variables defined for the same individuals escofier and pages 1994 mfa performs separate principal component analysis pca on each set of variables the elements of each set are then divided by the square root of the first eigenvalue of each pca and a global pca is then performed on the normalized data set we performed mfa for the ev time series sd ws rh and tmx for 644 stations by using the factominer package lê et al 2008 in r 3 23 r development core and team 2004 the first six factor loadings resulting from mfa were interpolated with kriging method using arcmap software version 10 0 4 results 4 1 relationships between driving climatic factors and et0 variability values for as bs and as bs range from 0 13 to 0 32 0 43 to 0 63 and 0 67 to 0 90 respectively fig 2 maximum as bs values 0 8 which indicate maximum atmospheric transmittance for very clear days are concentrated above 3000 m a s l in sw and w china our modelled as and bs values are in line with chen et al 2004 who give very similar values and a comparable spatial distribution averaged over the entire observation period 1960 2011 the four climatic factors sd ws rh and tmx accounted for almost 80 of annual et0 variation over china with higher ev in west china than in east china fig 3 in general sd explained the highest variance on average 32 with rh ws and tmx each explaining consecutively less ev table 1 at seasonal time scales spatial patterns of ev showed that sd was the most important climatic factor determining et0 rates in eastern china and during spring and summer season table 1 fig 4 a and b in contrast ws was important for et0 changes in the arid desert areas of northwest china during autumn and on the southern tibetan plateau during winter season fig 4c and d rh explained the highest variance during autumn and winter seasons average ev up to 47 while with the exception of northwestern china in spring fig 4a tmx ev remained low throughout the entire study area temporal attribution variability as shown by the all china ev time series fig 5 underlines that over the last 50 years sd always was by far the most important climatic factor explaining et0 rates with rh following on second place ws and tmx each explained slightly more than 10 while sd ev remained relatively stable rh ev experienced a rapid increase in the last two decades reaching ev similar to sd seasonal rankings however were more varied fig 6 shows a pronounced seasonal distinction between spring and summer and autumn and winter respectively spring and summer were dominated by sd explaining on average about 45 and 55 ev respectively with no distinct changes over time in autumn and winter the situation was reversed with rh explaining on average about 35 and 45 ev respectively rh ev increased continuously during the last two decades reaching the level of summer sd 4 2 temporal and spatial variation of attribution to illustrate spatial ev variability over time ev averaged over 4 time slices each covering 21 years are shown in fig 7 with the exception of tmx ev range for a given area never exceeding 20 all climatic variables showed pronounced variability in some cases with an ev range of more than 50 for a given area superimposed at large scales however sd and ws ev showed a stable bisection along a meridional line running appr at 105 e with high low ev for sd in the east west and vice versa for ws over the last 50 years the region of highest sd ev has moved northwards from the south china coast by more than 30 of latitude to extreme northeast china in a similar fashion the center of maximum ws ev moved to the south in western china but ws ev also decreased rapidly during the last two decades mfa analysis yielded 6 factors explaining a total variance of 46 out of these the first three each explained about 10 fig 8 in contrast to the spatial arrangement of the ev of the input data fig 7 most of the factors showed more zonal patterns particularly noteworthy are two linear structures in reof 2 and 6 at appr 27 n stretching through most of southeast china in contrast reof 4 showed a patchy appearance with no obvious zonal patterns 5 discussion since the first publication on et0 trends over china thomas 2000 numerous studies have confirmed that et0 trends are generally decreasing over china for a review of aed trends both in china and abroad see mcvicar et al 2012 china therefor fits in a global pattern of generally decreasing terrestrial et0 trends since china is a vast area with different climatic regions it is not surprising that spatial patterns of aed trends can be observed namely with regard to the temporal regimes of different monsoonal circulation branches aed trends however did not change monotonically during the observation period while trends mostly declined during the period 1960 1990 increasing trends were visible since the late 1990 s as reported by gao et al 2006 and zhang et al 2011a for the whole of china as well as by chen et al 2006 and zhang et al 2009 for the qinghai tibet plateau chen et al 2006 and xing et al 2016 suggest aed rates display decadal variations rather than monotonic changes this is already an indication that the climatic variables influencing et0 rates also have to vary both in temporal and spatial terms our attribution study of et0 rates in yunnan province in southwest china fan and thomas 2013 designed to analyze temporal variations of attribution has shown that attribution is highly variable over time both on an intra annual and inter annual variations level and between climatic variables seasonal variations appear to be linked to the change of properties and extent of monsoonal air masses in southwest china 5 1 relationships between driving climatic factors and et0 variability even though the decrease of sd ws and rh in general has to lead to declining et0 rates both trend magnitude and the sensitivity of et0 to meteorological variables have to be taken into account together to arrive at an understanding of the driving mechanism of et0 rates it is known that the sensitivity of et0 to meteorological variables also varies spatially fig 4 gong et al 2006 yin et al 2010b zhang et al 2011b the decline of sunshine duration global dimming is the main driving force for et0 decrease in tropical and subtropical china which is consistent with the finding from subtropical and tropical humid region of china yin et al 2010b stanhill and cohen 2001 in southeast china the increase of aerosol concentrations accompanied with urbanization resulted in a decrease of net radiation that led to decreases in et0 rates liu et al 2004 zhang et al 2011a lower ws stilling is the main cause of declining et0 rates in northwest china fig 4 which may be attributed to declining ws trends being higher in north china then in south china and being higher in winter than in summer xu et al 2006b wang et al 2007 guo et al 2011 zheng and wang 2014 the marked decrease of ws ev during the last five decades may be linked to a diminished monsoon circulation wang et al 2004 rh was found to be most sensitive variable explaining et0 rates in the yangtze river basin gong et al 2006 our data however show no remarkable connection between rh and et0 rates in this region as with the exception of the immediate coastal region moderate negative rh trends combine with low ev tmx always explained less than 25 of et0 rates in the agricultural important yangtze river basin tmx ev even reached the lowest values in all of china indicating almost no influence on et0 rates although warm temperatures induce et0 to increase mostly by lowering rh and providing energy input to the evaporating surface temperature effects on et0 rates were negligible compared to other factors yin et al 2010b 5 2 temporal and spatial variation of attribution the above cited studies were all based on average values over their respective study periods and have not considered temporal changes of the relative importance of climatic variables for et0 in a pilot study in yunnan province in southwest china we found that the attribution of climatic variables to et0 rates was not stable fan and thomas 2013 all china ev time series figs 5 and 6 show both long term trends such as a gradual rise and fall in sd ev but also decadal scale changes such as the rapid rise of rh ev since the late 1990s may in winter both sd and rh are directly influenced by changes in precipitation and cloudiness so varying ev values point to altered circulation patterns sea surface temperature and enso regimes are drivers of precipitation in east china ren et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 with increased winter precipitation in south china since 1993 as reported by ren et al 2016 both may have contributed to observed sd and rh ev changes spatial sd ws and to lesser extent rh ev patterns show a meridional division between east and west china at appr 100 105 e fig 7 this is a well known climatic division in south china between indian and chinese monsoon areas zhang 1988 that further north defines the extent of the influence of maritime monsoonal air masses in china domrös and peng 1988 this bisection is again an indication that the large scale circulation is mirrored in spatial ev patterns cloudiness and atmospheric water vapour content in eastern china control sd while predominantly dry and cloudless conditions in western china favor ws as dominant driver our finding is in line with taban and talaee 2014 who found that sd and ws dominate as drivers of et in humid and arid climates respectively we applied mfa to evaluate if an underlying spatial organization of ev can be found fig 8 mfa reveals three major spatial patterns reof 1 reof 3 that each explains about 10 of the total variance perhaps the most striking feature is the almost complete absence of the meridional division between east and west china visible in sd and ws ev in fig 7 instead a zonal arrangement is apparent reof 2 shows this zonal pattern more clearly with a distinct band of high values along appr 27 n in southeast china both reof 3 and reof 6 show a sharp transition in the same region this coincides with the region where most of the meiyu rainbands are initiated xu et al 2009 a seasonal precipitation belt that forms in early summer in southeast china precipitation and cloudiness as drivers of sd again point to the summer monsoon circulation as a possible decisive factor compared to reof 1 reof 3 the patchy pattern of reof 4 is an indicator of the influence of local factors which often are related to orography this might indicate regions where orographic obstacles lead to cloud formation and dissipation on windward and leeward slopes resp even though reof 4 bears only a superficial resemblance to an orographic map of china low values in particular follow large scale depression such as the tarim and tengger desert basins in northwest china and the yangtze river valley in southeast china for the allocation of water resources in the dominant rice growing areas of south china but also for the irrigation planning in the wheat growing areas in north china understanding and modelling the future amount and spatial distribution of et rates is of crucial importance et0 rates estimated from gcm results e g mo et al 2013 prudhomme and williamson 2013 xing et al 2014 are a key component for crop water balance calculations given our results gcm et0 rates based on formulations that do not include the effects of wind on et have to be regarded with caution particularly in arid climates where wind speeds dominate attribution taban and talaee 2014 et0 rates in temperature based models will depend mainly on the increasing temperature signal and consequently display rising instead of decreasing et0 rates such as in terink et al 2013 attribution of climatic variables can be considered a useful tool to verify if the underlying physics of a gcm model are able to reproduce the dependencies between et0 rates and forcing climatic variables validation of gcm based et0 rates should therefore not only be able to reproduce the spatial organization of et0 rates but also the spatio temporal patterns of attribution for century scale studies an adaption of the stomatal conductance value in the fao pm method to rising atmospheric co2 concentrations would have to be considered milly and dunne 2016 besides finding that large uncertainties exist in future et0 projections using different gcms xu et al 2014 also note that the sensitivity of et0 based on gcm data in the baseline period is very different from that based on observations indicating that the regional climate model did fail to preserve the sensitivity of et0 in the baseline period even though the sensitivity of their simulated data in the future period was similar to that in the baseline period it is obvious that in such a case the resulting projections should be seen with caution 6 conclusion even though temperatures have increased et0 and observed epan rates have in general been declining during the last decades both in china and on a global scale this contradicts the notion that et0 rates should increase in a warming climate decline of solar radiation rates global dimming and wind speeds stilling have been shown to be the main cause for decreased et0 rates the attribution of the four climatic variables sd ws rh and tmx to et0 rates in china varies geographically and on a seasonal basis maximum annual sd and ws ev are restricted to east and west china respectively while rh shows an irregular pattern of moderate ev with the exception of northwest china tmx ev are low throughout the study area we inferred that the east west division of sd and ws ev are the result of the monsoonal circulation with cloudiness governing sd variability in humid east china and ws dominating under mostly cloudless skies in arid west china the temporal evolution of annual evs shows that with the exception of the last years sd ev always ranked highest and decreased only slightly during the last decade in contrast rh ev experienced a rapid increase during the last two decades and reached sd levels in the last years due to an increase in winter ws and tmx evs remained on a low level and decreased slowly over the study period an analysis of the temporal patterns of circulation parameters over east asia vs ev values should allow distinguishing the underlying causes of the observed changes our results confirm that estimating et0 rates with simple temperature based estimation methods and without taking into account ws will likely give unreliable results particularly in arid climates for et0 estimates derived from gcm data

7356,for the study and modeling of hydrological phenomena both in urban and rural areas a proper estimation of the areal reduction factor arf is crucial in this paper we estimated the arf from observed rainfall data as the ratio between the average rainfall occurring in a specific area and the point rainfall then we compared the obtained arf values with some of the most widespread empirical approaches in literature which are used when rainfall observations are not available results highlight that the literature formulations can lead to a substantial over or underestimation of the arf estimated from observed data these findings can have severe consequences especially in the design of hydraulic structures where empirical formulations are extensively applied the aim of this paper is to present a new analytical relationship with an explicit dependence on the rainfall duration and area that can better represent the arf area trend over the area case of study the analytical curve presented here can find an important application to estimate the arf values for design purposes the test study area is the lazio region central italy keywords areal reduction factor extreme rainfall events design rainfall events rainfall variability 1 introduction it is well acknowledged that precipitation occurs with significant changes in the intensity values over distances of less than one kilometer and time intervals on the order of a minute austin and houze 1972 as shown by weather radar observations precipitation of different intensities sizes and shapes occurs simultaneously this is due to the fact that large mesoscale areas include small mesoscale areas which in turn include smaller rain cells the approximation of rainfall measurements over a specific basin using only one rain gauge can lead to limitations due to the highly variable characteristics of rainfall fields langousis and kaleris 2013 as a consequence spatial rainfall averages differ significantly from point measurements for large areas and short durations eleuch et al 2010 tripathi and dominguez 2013 the highly variable rainfall structure has several implications in many hydrological issues such as sewer system design vaes et al 2005 flood control measure in urban drainage systems bacchi and ranzi 1996 rainfall sensors network design rodríguez iturbe and mejía 1974 and flood forecasting ridolfi et al 2013 montesarchio et al 2015 montesarchio et al 2011 as fine space time rainfall resolution is needed the natural environment research council nerc flood studies report national environmental research council 1975 defined a methodology to obtain areal rainfall from point rainfall values of specified durations and return periods tr the coefficient that allows the transformation from punctual to areal rainfall is the areal reduction factor coefficient arf earlier the u s weather bureau u s wb weather bureau 1958 developed a set of curves based on rainfall data with length ranging from 7 to 15 years these rainfall data were measured by dense rain gauges networks deployed in the usa the u s wb considered storm durations ranging from 30 min to 24 h and estimated the areal reduction factor values for areas ranging from 250 to 1000 km2 the results were widely adopted even if the curves can differ significantly when evaluated in different parts of the world de michele et al 2001 as the arf is defined as the ratio between the areal average rainfall and the point rainfall there exist several different approaches to define this ratio as a consequence different approaches can result in arfs with different properties wright et al 2014 several factors influence the ratio between the spatial average rainfall over a specific area and the rainfall measured in a point these factors can be related to the characteristics of the rainfall itself to the characteristics of the catchment under study and to the data and methods used svensson and jones 2010 the rainfall patterns highly effect the rainfall distribution over an area for instance as found by skaugen 1997 in norway the spatial averages of large scale frontal events do not reduce by much in magnitude with an increasing area whereas the spatial averages of small scale convective events do moreover the author found that the difference in the arf values between convective and frontal events is more pronounced for high return periods similarly for north carolina and new jersey allen and degaetano 2005 found that the arf decreases with increasing areas for high return periods this behaviour was also found for texas by asquith and famiglietti 2000 in contrast for large areas i e greater than 500 km2 grebner and roesch 1997 found that the arfs were independent from the return period allen and degaetano 2005 investigated the effect of seasonality and found that arf values are smaller in the summer season than in the winter season because of the increased convection in warm periods during warm seasons rainfall events are more convective and thus characterised by heavy punctual occurrences this behaviour also characterises events with high return periods providing an explanation for the decrease in arf with increasing return periods the basin characteristics such as topography veneziano and langousis 2005 and shape huff 1995 do not affect the arf estimation while the settlement type may not influence the arf it is worth noting that rural and urban areas may differ for the number of rain gauges thus the denser the rain gauges network the finer the arf estimation could be barbero et al 2014 veneziano and langousis 2005 quantified the distortion in the arf scaling due to the widespread procedure of evaluating the areal rainfall from sparse rain gauges networks in contrast allen and degaetano 2005 found almost no influence on the arf of a dense rain gauges network comparing the estimated arf using rainfall collected by a dense rainfall sensors network and a weather radar throughout the time many authors investigated the areal reduction factor and obtained new methodologies for its estimation for instance roche 1966 derived a theoretical method based on the correlation structure of intense storm events the theory was further developed by rodriguez iturbe and mejía 1974 bringing variance function and variance reduction factors together sivapalan and blöschl 1998 developed a method whose main idea is to derive the distribution of catchment average rainfall intensity from that of one point rainfall asquith and famiglietti 2000 derived the arf as the catchment average of the ratio between the return tr year rainfall depths at a specific distance from the centroid of the storm and at the centroid itself de michele et al 2001 obtained a new physically based formula for the arf reflecting the scaling properties in space and time of rainfall as presented in a comprehensive review by svensson and jones 2010 many empirical methods have been proposed empirical methods are generally data and computationally onerous but they do not rely heavily on distributional or other assumptions about the rainfall process as distinguished by omolayo 1993 empirical methods can be divided in two main categories storm centred and fixed area the former considers changing for each storm both the region where the areal rainfall is averaged and the location where the point rainfall is observed the storm centred approach seemed to be not suitable to estimate areal rainfall of a particular frequency from point rainfall omolayo 1993 this is due to the fact that extreme point rainfall and extreme areal rainfall could be generated by different storms or storm types conversely the fixed area method is more widespread partly due to a lower relative difficulty of implementation according the fixed area approach the region where the areal rainfall is estimated is known beforehand and fixed both in time and in space this implies that the point rainfall location may not coincide with the centre of the fixed area the empirical relationships are to be used when rainfall observations are not available for the area of study because of the importance of the arf in the design of hydraulic structures it is of utmost importance to determine if the existing methodologies are suitable for the case study under analysis to this end in this paper we evaluated the arf coefficient in the lazio region from observed rainfall data through an empirical approach and we compared it to four widespread empirical estimates i e the formulations proposed by koutsoyiannis and xanthopoulos 1999 moisello and papiri 1986 eagleson 1972 and chow 1964 the arf estimated with the first three formulations and the one derived from rainfall data collected in the case study area under analysis are derived using the fixed area approach results show that arf values obtained with empirical formulations may consistently differ from the arf values estimated from rainfall observations this is true especially for short durations and large areas furthermore the arf assumes values equal to one where point rainfall is measured i e areas equal to zero and slightly lower than one for areas of 1 km2 as a consequence an arf smaller than one should not be applied to areas smaller than 1 km2 since it would lead to an underestimation of rainfall design values this is in agreement with what was found by lombardo et al 2006 that analysed the differences between the arf estimated through empirical relationships and the arf estimated using rainfall data retrieved from weather radar observations collected in a portion of our case study area however arf values obtained using rainfall data from a weather radar can differ from arf estimated from rain gauges especially for large areas svensson and jones 2010 some authors recognize that it can be due to the beam broadening and the increase in height with range of the radar sample volume which cause temporal and spatial sampling differences between weather radar and rain gauges berenguer and zawadzki 2008 villarini et al 2008 in this framework it was evident the necessity of investigating the arf behaviour on the case study area using a wide data set and then deriving a general relationship to provide a better estimate of the arf in the area of study the analytical relationship presented here shows an explicit dependence on both the rainfall duration and the area indeed rainfall duration has a key role in the estimation of the arf value as found for this case study and in agreement with the nerc which analysed a wide range of durations i e from 1 min to 25 days moreover the rainfall duration is key in structures design as it is linked to the basin concentration time the effect of the return period is still a controversial issue as also highlighted by svensson and jones 2010 many authors recognized that the arf decreases with the increasing return period e g bell 1976 the flood studies report national environmental research council 1975 estimated the arf for return periods of 5 and 10 years and then tended to be conservative for longer return period values commonly adopted for engineering design purposes in this study we estimated the arfs for a return period of 2 years commonly associated to the highest probability of failure of hydraulic structures rootzén and katz 2013 the paper is organised as follows first the methodology used to estimate the arf from observed rainfall data is introduced the arf values obtained for the case study are analysed and then compared with those obtained from literature formulations finally we present a new analytical relationship to estimate the arf area trend for durations ranging from 0 5 to 6 h the test study area is the lazio region central italy 2 methodology in this section the concept of arf is introduced the methodology to estimate it from rainfall data according to the definition presented among the others by lombardo et al 2006 is detailed then the empirical formulations used for comparison are introduced 2 1 arf definition the arf is defined as the ratio between an areal rainfall and a point rainfall measured by one rain gauge the areal rainfall is obtained interpolating point rainfall measurements given by rain gauges deployed on that specific area it is interesting to highlight that the methodology used to interpolate the rainfall across the area does not substantially influence the arf value allen and degaetano 2005 in this paper we used the fixed area approach as already defined in the introduction section it consists in taking an extreme value of the areal average rainfall over a geographically fixed area such as a catchment and dividing it by a corresponding value of the point rainfall that is typical for the area svensson and jones 2010 the point rainfall is a heavy rainfall event observed at the centre of the considered area the rain gauge in the centre point will be henceforth named central rain gauge the dimensionless arf is given by 1 arf a d h a d h d where h d is a point rainfall depth measured by a central rain gauge during a heavy rainfall event with duration d h a d is the interpolated rainfall depth of duration d observed by all rain gauges falling within the area a when the heavy rainfall event is recorded by the central rain gauge the area a is centred at the central rain gauge the rain gauges falling in the area a are henceforth called scout rain gauges with regard to the design of hydraulic works the arf is estimated for areas with different extent to this end 10 areal classes are considered for analysis the minimum and maximum area values equal 1 km2 and 1000 km2 respectively while the intermediate values equal 10 25 50 75 100 250 500 and 750 km2 the influence of the catchment shape on the arf estimation is generally small as demonstrated by veneziano and langousis 2005 in this work n circular shaped areas with n 10 centred in the i th central rain gauge have been considered to estimate the values of heavy rainfall for each central rain gauge and thus the value of point rainfall i e denominator in eq 1 the depth duration frequency curves ddfs are constructed for each rain gauge which has been considered as central rain gauge the ddfs define the relationship between a rain depth h with specific return period tr and a specific duration d the site specific ddf curve characterised by three parameters is adopted 2 h d t r a t r d b d m where h d tr is the rainfall depth having a duration d and return period tr a tr b and m are positive parameters hence for each central rain gauge the ddfs with return period of 2 years are then used as threshold values to select extreme rainfall events for each duration i e 0 5 1 3 and 6 h as fully explained by lombardo et al 2006 we used a return period of 2 years since it is associated to the highest value of probability of failure of hydraulic structures this assumption allowed us to estimate an arf associated to a return period value which is precautionary for the design of hydraulic structures for the sake of clarity in the followings we detail the procedure to evaluate the arf step by step 1 for a specific central rain gauge select the rainfall events that exceed the ddf built with duration d i e heavy rainfall values and return period equal to 2 years each exceeding rainfall event is a point rainfall value h d in eq 1 2 identify the rain gauges falling in the n th area i e the scout rain gauges centred at the i th central rain gauge 3 estimate the arithmetic mean value h a d of the rainfall depths recorded by the scout rain gauges identified at step 2 when each extreme event was gauged at the central rain gauge 4 evaluate the arf value according to eq 1 for each point rainfall event identified at step 1 for each i th central rain gauge repeat steps from 2 to 4 for every duration of interest and every n th area therefore for each area and duration it was possible to obtain an envelope of arf values which was analysed as explained in section 4 2 2 arf formulations selected for comparison we recall that in this paper we investigated if the arf obtained from observed data can be well estimated by four widespread literature formulations the empirical literature approaches selected to estimate the arf depend on the rainfall duration and in some cases on the area these formulations could be applied to estimate the arf when rainfall data are not available although their reliability should be appropriately evaluated for pluviometric regimes different from the calibration one the formulation proposed by koutsoyiannis and xanthopoulos 1999 was found fitting the nerc arf values with the following analytical relationship 3 arf kx a d 1 0 048 a 0 36 0 01 ln a d 0 35 where a is the area under investigation in squared kilometers and d is the rainfall duration in hours this relationship was compared with a nomograph constructed for the western u s a by the u s weather bureau where the differences are visible but not very substantial thus the authors concluded that this supports applicability of eq 3 in other parts of the world on the other hand the areal reduction coefficient proposed by chow 1964 depends only on the area under study 4 arf c a 1 1 93 a 10 3 1 it was found using data collected in illinois and it is valid for areas smaller than 750 km2 moisello and papiri 1986 related the arf to rainfall duration and to the extension of the area under study 5 arf mp a d

1972 was found interpolating the arf values obtained for the east coast of the u s by the u s weather bureau for durations ranging from 0 5 to 24 h and for basins smaller than 560 km2 and it is as

that for short durations rainfall events are more contained and restricted to each specific central rain gauge on the other hand for large durations in a specific area it is possible to observe other rain gauges which have measured a rainfall event similar to or greater than the one measured by the central rain gauge these results can be explained by the different types of rainfall events

7356,for the study and modeling of hydrological phenomena both in urban and rural areas a proper estimation of the areal reduction factor arf is crucial in this paper we estimated the arf from observed rainfall data as the ratio between the average rainfall occurring in a specific area and the point rainfall then we compared the obtained arf values with some of the most widespread empirical approaches in literature which are used when rainfall observations are not available results highlight that the literature formulations can lead to a substantial over or underestimation of the arf estimated from observed data these findings can have severe consequences especially in the design of hydraulic structures where empirical formulations are extensively applied the aim of this paper is to present a new analytical relationship with an explicit dependence on the rainfall duration and area that can better represent the arf area trend over the area case of study the analytical curve presented here can find an important application to estimate the arf values for design purposes the test study area is the lazio region central italy keywords areal reduction factor extreme rainfall events design rainfall events rainfall variability 1 introduction it is well acknowledged that precipitation occurs with significant changes in the intensity values over distances of less than one kilometer and time intervals on the order of a minute austin and houze 1972 as shown by weather radar observations precipitation of different intensities sizes and shapes occurs simultaneously this is due to the fact that large mesoscale areas include small mesoscale areas which in turn include smaller rain cells the approximation of rainfall measurements over a specific basin using only one rain gauge can lead to limitations due to the highly variable characteristics of rainfall fields langousis and kaleris 2013 as a consequence spatial rainfall averages differ significantly from point measurements for large areas and short durations eleuch et al 2010 tripathi and dominguez 2013 the highly variable rainfall structure has several implications in many hydrological issues such as sewer system design vaes et al 2005 flood control measure in urban drainage systems bacchi and ranzi 1996 rainfall sensors network design rodríguez iturbe and mejía 1974 and flood forecasting ridolfi et al 2013 montesarchio et al 2015 montesarchio et al 2011 as fine space time rainfall resolution is needed the natural environment research council nerc flood studies report national environmental research council 1975 defined a methodology to obtain areal rainfall from point rainfall values of specified durations and return periods tr the coefficient that allows the transformation from punctual to areal rainfall is the areal reduction factor coefficient arf earlier the u s weather bureau u s wb weather bureau 1958 developed a set of curves based on rainfall data with length ranging from 7 to 15 years these rainfall data were measured by dense rain gauges networks deployed in the usa the u s wb considered storm durations ranging from 30 min to 24 h and estimated the areal reduction factor values for areas ranging from 250 to 1000 km2 the results were widely adopted even if the curves can differ significantly when evaluated in different parts of the world de michele et al 2001 as the arf is defined as the ratio between the areal average rainfall and the point rainfall there exist several different approaches to define this ratio as a consequence different approaches can result in arfs with different properties wright et al 2014 several factors influence the ratio between the spatial average rainfall over a specific area and the rainfall measured in a point these factors can be related to the characteristics of the rainfall itself to the characteristics of the catchment under study and to the data and methods used svensson and jones 2010 the rainfall patterns highly effect the rainfall distribution over an area for instance as found by skaugen 1997 in norway the spatial averages of large scale frontal events do not reduce by much in magnitude with an increasing area whereas the spatial averages of small scale convective events do moreover the author found that the difference in the arf values between convective and frontal events is more pronounced for high return periods similarly for north carolina and new jersey allen and degaetano 2005 found that the arf decreases with increasing areas for high return periods this behaviour was also found for texas by asquith and famiglietti 2000 in contrast for large areas i e greater than 500 km2 grebner and roesch 1997 found that the arfs were independent from the return period allen and degaetano 2005 investigated the effect of seasonality and found that arf values are smaller in the summer season than in the winter season because of the increased convection in warm periods during warm seasons rainfall events are more convective and thus characterised by heavy punctual occurrences this behaviour also characterises events with high return periods providing an explanation for the decrease in arf with increasing return periods the basin characteristics such as topography veneziano and langousis 2005 and shape huff 1995 do not affect the arf estimation while the settlement type may not influence the arf it is worth noting that rural and urban areas may differ for the number of rain gauges thus the denser the rain gauges network the finer the arf estimation could be barbero et al 2014 veneziano and langousis 2005 quantified the distortion in the arf scaling due to the widespread procedure of evaluating the areal rainfall from sparse rain gauges networks in contrast allen and degaetano 2005 found almost no influence on the arf of a dense rain gauges network comparing the estimated arf using rainfall collected by a dense rainfall sensors network and a weather radar throughout the time many authors investigated the areal reduction factor and obtained new methodologies for its estimation for instance roche 1966 derived a theoretical method based on the correlation structure of intense storm events the theory was further developed by rodriguez iturbe and mejía 1974 bringing variance function and variance reduction factors together sivapalan and blöschl 1998 developed a method whose main idea is to derive the distribution of catchment average rainfall intensity from that of one point rainfall asquith and famiglietti 2000 derived the arf as the catchment average of the ratio between the return tr year rainfall depths at a specific distance from the centroid of the storm and at the centroid itself de michele et al 2001 obtained a new physically based formula for the arf reflecting the scaling properties in space and time of rainfall as presented in a comprehensive review by svensson and jones 2010 many empirical methods have been proposed empirical methods are generally data and computationally onerous but they do not rely heavily on distributional or other assumptions about the rainfall process as distinguished by omolayo 1993 empirical methods can be divided in two main categories storm centred and fixed area the former considers changing for each storm both the region where the areal rainfall is averaged and the location where the point rainfall is observed the storm centred approach seemed to be not suitable to estimate areal rainfall of a particular frequency from point rainfall omolayo 1993 this is due to the fact that extreme point rainfall and extreme areal rainfall could be generated by different storms or storm types conversely the fixed area method is more widespread partly due to a lower relative difficulty of implementation according the fixed area approach the region where the areal rainfall is estimated is known beforehand and fixed both in time and in space this implies that the point rainfall location may not coincide with the centre of the fixed area the empirical relationships are to be used when rainfall observations are not available for the area of study because of the importance of the arf in the design of hydraulic structures it is of utmost importance to determine if the existing methodologies are suitable for the case study under analysis to this end in this paper we evaluated the arf coefficient in the lazio region from observed rainfall data through an empirical approach and we compared it to four widespread empirical estimates i e the formulations proposed by koutsoyiannis and xanthopoulos 1999 moisello and papiri 1986 eagleson 1972 and chow 1964 the arf estimated with the first three formulations and the one derived from rainfall data collected in the case study area under analysis are derived using the fixed area approach results show that arf values obtained with empirical formulations may consistently differ from the arf values estimated from rainfall observations this is true especially for short durations and large areas furthermore the arf assumes values equal to one where point rainfall is measured i e areas equal to zero and slightly lower than one for areas of 1 km2 as a consequence an arf smaller than one should not be applied to areas smaller than 1 km2 since it would lead to an underestimation of rainfall design values this is in agreement with what was found by lombardo et al 2006 that analysed the differences between the arf estimated through empirical relationships and the arf estimated using rainfall data retrieved from weather radar observations collected in a portion of our case study area however arf values obtained using rainfall data from a weather radar can differ from arf estimated from rain gauges especially for large areas svensson and jones 2010 some authors recognize that it can be due to the beam broadening and the increase in height with range of the radar sample volume which cause temporal and spatial sampling differences between weather radar and rain gauges berenguer and zawadzki 2008 villarini et al 2008 in this framework it was evident the necessity of investigating the arf behaviour on the case study area using a wide data set and then deriving a general relationship to provide a better estimate of the arf in the area of study the analytical relationship presented here shows an explicit dependence on both the rainfall duration and the area indeed rainfall duration has a key role in the estimation of the arf value as found for this case study and in agreement with the nerc which analysed a wide range of durations i e from 1 min to 25 days moreover the rainfall duration is key in structures design as it is linked to the basin concentration time the effect of the return period is still a controversial issue as also highlighted by svensson and jones 2010 many authors recognized that the arf decreases with the increasing return period e g bell 1976 the flood studies report national environmental research council 1975 estimated the arf for return periods of 5 and 10 years and then tended to be conservative for longer return period values commonly adopted for engineering design purposes in this study we estimated the arfs for a return period of 2 years commonly associated to the highest probability of failure of hydraulic structures rootzén and katz 2013 the paper is organised as follows first the methodology used to estimate the arf from observed rainfall data is introduced the arf values obtained for the case study are analysed and then compared with those obtained from literature formulations finally we present a new analytical relationship to estimate the arf area trend for durations ranging from 0 5 to 6 h the test study area is the lazio region central italy 2 methodology in this section the concept of arf is introduced the methodology to estimate it from rainfall data according to the definition presented among the others by lombardo et al 2006 is detailed then the empirical formulations used for comparison are introduced 2 1 arf definition the arf is defined as the ratio between an areal rainfall and a point rainfall measured by one rain gauge the areal rainfall is obtained interpolating point rainfall measurements given by rain gauges deployed on that specific area it is interesting to highlight that the methodology used to interpolate the rainfall across the area does not substantially influence the arf value allen and degaetano 2005 in this paper we used the fixed area approach as already defined in the introduction section it consists in taking an extreme value of the areal average rainfall over a geographically fixed area such as a catchment and dividing it by a corresponding value of the point rainfall that is typical for the area svensson and jones 2010 the point rainfall is a heavy rainfall event observed at the centre of the considered area the rain gauge in the centre point will be henceforth named central rain gauge the dimensionless arf is given by 1 arf a d h a d h d where h d is a point rainfall depth measured by a central rain gauge during a heavy rainfall event with duration d h a d is the interpolated rainfall depth of duration d observed by all rain gauges falling within the area a when the heavy rainfall event is recorded by the central rain gauge the area a is centred at the central rain gauge the rain gauges falling in the area a are henceforth called scout rain gauges with regard to the design of hydraulic works the arf is estimated for areas with different extent to this end 10 areal classes are considered for analysis the minimum and maximum area values equal 1 km2 and 1000 km2 respectively while the intermediate values equal 10 25 50 75 100 250 500 and 750 km2 the influence of the catchment shape on the arf estimation is generally small as demonstrated by veneziano and langousis 2005 in this work n circular shaped areas with n 10 centred in the i th central rain gauge have been considered to estimate the values of heavy rainfall for each central rain gauge and thus the value of point rainfall i e denominator in eq 1 the depth duration frequency curves ddfs are constructed for each rain gauge which has been considered as central rain gauge the ddfs define the relationship between a rain depth h with specific return period tr and a specific duration d the site specific ddf curve characterised by three parameters is adopted 2 h d t r a t r d b d m where h d tr is the rainfall depth having a duration d and return period tr a tr b and m are positive parameters hence for each central rain gauge the ddfs with return period of 2 years are then used as threshold values to select extreme rainfall events for each duration i e 0 5 1 3 and 6 h as fully explained by lombardo et al 2006 we used a return period of 2 years since it is associated to the highest value of probability of failure of hydraulic structures this assumption allowed us to estimate an arf associated to a return period value which is precautionary for the design of hydraulic structures for the sake of clarity in the followings we detail the procedure to evaluate the arf step by step 1 for a specific central rain gauge select the rainfall events that exceed the ddf built with duration d i e heavy rainfall values and return period equal to 2 years each exceeding rainfall event is a point rainfall value h d in eq 1 2 identify the rain gauges falling in the n th area i e the scout rain gauges centred at the i th central rain gauge 3 estimate the arithmetic mean value h a d of the rainfall depths recorded by the scout rain gauges identified at step 2 when each extreme event was gauged at the central rain gauge 4 evaluate the arf value according to eq 1 for each point rainfall event identified at step 1 for each i th central rain gauge repeat steps from 2 to 4 for every duration of interest and every n th area therefore for each area and duration it was possible to obtain an envelope of arf values which was analysed as explained in section 4 2 2 arf formulations selected for comparison we recall that in this paper we investigated if the arf obtained from observed data can be well estimated by four widespread literature formulations the empirical literature approaches selected to estimate the arf depend on the rainfall duration and in some cases on the area these formulations could be applied to estimate the arf when rainfall data are not available although their reliability should be appropriately evaluated for pluviometric regimes different from the calibration one the formulation proposed by koutsoyiannis and xanthopoulos 1999 was found fitting the nerc arf values with the following analytical relationship 3 arf kx a d 1 0 048 a 0 36 0 01 ln a d 0 35 where a is the area under investigation in squared kilometers and d is the rainfall duration in hours this relationship was compared with a nomograph constructed for the western u s a by the u s weather bureau where the differences are visible but not very substantial thus the authors concluded that this supports applicability of eq 3 in other parts of the world on the other hand the areal reduction coefficient proposed by chow 1964 depends only on the area under study 4 arf c a 1 1 93 a 10 3 1 it was found using data collected in illinois and it is valid for areas smaller than 750 km2 moisello and papiri 1986 related the arf to rainfall duration and to the extension of the area under study 5 arf mp a d

1972 was found interpolating the arf values obtained for the east coast of the u s by the u s weather bureau for durations ranging from 0 5 to 24 h and for basins smaller than 560 km2 and it is as

forecasting purpose but other sources are related to the hydrological modelling part of the heps this study focuses on the uncertainties arising from the hydrological model parameters and initial soil moisture with aim to design an ensemble based version of an hydrological model dedicated to mediterranean fast responding rivers simulations the isba top coupled system the first step consists in identifying the parameters that have the strongest influence on ff simulations by assuming perfect precipitation a sensitivity study is carried out first using a synthetic framework and then for several real events and several catchments perturbation methods varying the most sensitive parameters as well as initial soil moisture allow designing an ensemble based version of isba top the first results of this system on some real events are presented the direct perspective of this work will be to drive this ensemble based version with the members of a convective scale meteorological ensemble prediction system to design a complete heps for ff forecasting keywords flash floods uncertainty ensemble hydrodynamic parameters initial soil moisture 1 introduction the western mediterranean region is regularly affected by devastating flash floods ff due to heavy precipitation events ricard et al 2012 especially during the autumn months this affects the lives of thousands of people and cause extensive and costly damage llasat et al 2012 gaume et al 2009 several works intend to improve ff forecasting around the world recent examples can be found in china miao et al 2016 in the us hardy et al 2016 in saudi arabia tekeli and fouli 2016 and around the mediterranean ferraris et al 2002 amengual et al 2008 vincendon et al 2011 vié et al 2012 artinyan et al 2016 for instance in the framework of the international hymex hydrological cycle in mediterranean experiment program drobinski et al 2014 ducrocq et al 2014 it remains particularly challenging to model and forecast ff first rainfall forcing data are needed at time and space scales relevant to the hydrologic process of interest typically at least 1h 1 km 2 but the use of sub hourly rainfall can be beneficial rainfall estimates are uncertain and rainfall forecasts even more and these uncertainties propagate all along the hydro meteorological modelling chain pappenberger et al 2005 zappa et al 2010 second accurate information about initial soil moisture conditions included the space distribution among the watershed is required rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 but is seldom well known especially at kilometric resolutions brocca et al 2008 then provided that proper rainfall forcing and initial soil moisture states are available hydrological models themselves introduce uncertainty indeed some physical processes are not or partially represented by the model equations many processes are not linear and some of them are subject to threshold effects beyond this model structure uncertainty hydrological models parameters are uncertain beven and binley 1992 vrugt et al 2003 moradkhani et al 2005 refsgaard et al 2012 too consequently various types of uncertainty affect the whole hydrometeorological modelling chain to address this question hydrological ensemble prediction systems heps have been developed in particular within coordinated initiatives such as cost731 zappa et al 2010 map d phase rotach et al 2009 or hepex hydrological ensemble prediction experiment schaake et al 2007 thielen et al 2008 among others many heps are based on the use of ensemble precipitation prediction to drive a hydrological model bartholomes and todini 2005 siccardi et al 2005 thielen et al 2009 vincendon et al 2011 they do not consider uncertainty inherent in hydrological modelling and initial soil conditions data assimilation techniques can be used to reduce or quantify the uncertainty on model states abaza et al 2014 noh et al 2014 the uncertainty on hydrological model structure and parameters is rather managed through post processing analysis solomatine and shrestha 2009 bogner and pappenberger 2011 biondi and de luca 2012 that consists of adjusting the hydrological model outputs by estimating the probability distribution of the model error zalachori et al 2012 compare several bias correction strategies a lot of them rely on bayesian framework krzysztofowicz 1999 todini 2008 reggiani et al 2009 among others ensemble empirical dressing approaches or regression analysis are also used to post process model outputs olsson and lindstrom 2008 weerts et al 2011 boucher et al 2012 zalachori et al 2012 hashino et al 2007 among others those methods consider the hydrological model uncertainty as a whole or the total chain uncertainty using several hydrological models is a way to consider model structure ambiguities georgakakos et al 2004 velazquez et al 2010 it is not common however that heps are built on the basis of perturbation of parameters liu et al 2012 the relative influence of uncertainties from different sources initial moisture conditions model structure or parameters and the way to consider them to build a heps remains an open question in the field of ff modelling zhang et al 2016 indeed the physical processes involved in ff generation are small time and space scales ones so they deserve particular attention disentangling the different sources of uncertainty is required to be able to both identify and rank them the major uncertainty in ff forecasting comes from the rainfall forecast the latter can be sampled using convection permitting meteorological ensemble prediction systems when focusing on the hydrological uncertainty an appropriate and simple methodology is to use the hydrometeorological forecasting chain in a simulation mode using observed rainfall forcing fields and considering them as perfect rain it thus produces an ensemble discharge simulation from a single rainfall scenario mediero et al 2011 using this approach the present study looks at the sensitivity of model outputs to its hydrodynamic parameters and initial soil moisture conditions the hydrometeorological forecasting chain considered for this study relies on the isba top modelling system bouilloud et al 2010 this system is already part of an heps that considers the uncertainty on rainfall forcing using multiple members coming from a convection permitting numerical weather prediction model vincendon et al 2011 the final aim of the present work is to complement this heps addressing the issue of hydrological uncertainty model parameters and initial state the first step of the study consists in identifying which parameters have the strongest impact on the discharge simulations model parameters are however interrelated which makes difficult a sampling of the distribution of the different parameters liu et al 2012 clark et al 2011 pointed out also that data uncertainty constrains our ability to discriminate among competing hydrological hypotheses to overcome these difficulties a multiple working hypotheses fenicia et al 2008 clark et al 2011 framework is used here the influence of model parameters is studied first in a synthetic set up with perfect rain that allows neglecting the uncertainty coming from rainfall inputs and space heterogeneity for instance this permits to answer several questions i which parameters have more impact than others on ff modelling ii does the impact of each individual parameters depend on the initial soil moisture iii does the heterogeneity of the soil texture need to be considered when evaluating the sensitivity to the parameters in a second part the sensitivity analysis is complemented with real events simulations to rank the impact of the various model parameters then based on the sensitivity analysis results the most sensitive model parameters are perturbed together with the initial soil moisture field to produce ensemble discharge simulations finally the skill of the proposed ensemble has been assessed this study will allow to identify the sensitive parameters of a coupled hydrological model and to design an ensemble based system dedicated to ff modelling based on the parameters and initial conditions uncertainty this will contitute a component of a more general heps dealing also with rainfall uncertainty by the use of a meteorological ensemble the results and method reported in this paper could be usefull for designing others heps in the context of ff forecasting the outline of this paper is as follows the model and the methodology are presented in section 2 results are discussed in section 3 conclusions and future work are presented in the last section 2 data model and methodology 2 1 isba top model and its parameters the isba top system a physically based model developed at the french national centre for meteorological research the acronym in french is cnrm is a coupling between the land surface model isba noilhan and planton 1989 and topodyn pellarin et al 2002 a version of the hydrological model topmodel beven and kirkby 1979 which improves the simulation of flash floods in mediterranean regions isba is a surface scheme that deals with water and energy budgets on a rectangular domain divided into 1 km 2 meshes it governs the overall budget across soil columns the watersheds are described based on a 50m digital terrain model dtm topmodel computes the sub surface lateral water fluxes and space time dynamics of the saturated areas using the watershed topography isba top is designed to simulate fields of all the water budget components evaporation runoff soil water contents the routing module is based on a geomorphological method le lay et al 2008 to transfer water from any point of the catchment to the nearest point of the river and then along the river up to the outlet it makes use of speeds of transfer on the hillslopes and in the river calibrated by bouilloud et al 2010 by a comparison between simulated and observed discharges chronics the uncertainty that affects this part of the model will be considered in a future work once the new version of this routing module developed by artinyan et al 2016 is implemented on the studied region bouilloud et al 2010 fully describe the original version of isba top the version used in this study has been deeply updated from the original version and is described in vincendon et al 2016 the isba df soil multilayer diffusion scheme boone et al 2000 decharme et al 2011 is used in this new version most of the soil hydrodynamic parameters used in isba top can be derived from soil surveys through pedotransfer function ptf approaches even the m parameter that is inherited from the topmodel approach is now derived from the ptf the two parameters that needed to be calibrated are not used anymore in this new isba top version it thus makes easier using isba top for any catchment especially ungauged small ones with satisfactory results vincendon et al 2016 discuss the advantages of this new isba top version fig 1 a shows the simulation domain studied in the present work isba top relies on the following hydrodynamic parameters the volumetric water content at saturation w sat which is reached when all soil pores are filled with water the water content at the wilting point w wilt which is reached when there is not enough water in the soil to meet the plant s needs the field capacity w fc which is the amount of water remaining in the soil after excess water has drained and the downward movement rate has decreased the saturated hydraulic conductivity k sat which describes how easily water can move through saturated soil it characterizes the flow speed for darcy s law the soil matric potential at saturation ψ sat which is the potential energy of water in saturated soil it characterizes the suction energy the parameter b is a dimensionless shape parameter of the soil water retention curve which links the matric potential ψ and the soil volumetric water content w using the brooks and corey 1966 model together with the relationships from clapp and hornberger 1978 1 ψ w ψ sat w w sat b k ψ k sat ψ ψ sat 2 b 3 b k w k sat w w sat 2 b 3 for a given soil water content w as w w sat is always lower or equal to 1 the higher b is the smaller the conductivity of water in the soil is the rate of decrease of the transmissivity m for a given soil depth d the transmissivity at this depth t d is given by 2 t d t 0 e d m with t 0 the transmissivity at the soil surface that is linearly linked to k w at the soil surface and m given by 3 m w sat w fc 4 this formulation of m comes from the original coupling isba top bouilloud et al 2010 4 is the default value for the exponential decay factor of the saturated hydraulic conductivity so the lower m is the lower the transmissivity t d is the values of these soil hydrodynamic parameters are derived from soil surveys through pedotransfer function ptf approaches several sets of ptfs were proposed in past studies clapp and hornberger 1978 but also cosby et al 1984 carsel and parrish 1988 and wösten et al 1999 among others related soil hydrodynamic parameters to the soil fraction of sand silt and clay and organic matter content two of those sets are implemented in isba df clapp and hornberger 1978 and cosby et al 1984 ones referred to herein as ch 78 and co 84 respectively for succinctness see a for a detailed description they both link each hydrological parameter to the percentage of sand and a percentage of clay table 1 gives an example of the values of the hydrodynamic parameters for a given percentage of sand and clay for ch 78 and co 84 ptfs so has to inform about the gap between the values obtained with both ptfs the range interval informs about the minimum and maximum values it has been obtained from the literature about field experiments 2 2 sensitivity experiments 2 2 1 synthetic framework clark et al 2011 recommended a multiple hypotheses framework to enable testing individual modelling options in order to attribute differences of the overall model performance to a specific modelling decision the aim of the present experiments is to assess i if some parameters have more impact than others ii if the impact of each individual parameters depends on the initial soil moisture and iii if the heterogeneity of the soil texture has to be considered in the sensitivity analysis those issues are adressed using a synthetic configuration for isba top simulations much simpler than real events configuration a first advantage is to neglect of data dependency resolution uncertainty another is that it allows running the isba top model many times at a low computational cost indeed rainfall soil characteristics and initial soil moisture are homogeneous so fewer exchanges occur within the model meshes so it runs more rapidly vincendon et al 2010 used such a synthetic framework for studying the benefit of using isba top original coupling rather than isba alone based on experiments using a single catchment with uniform soil texture and homogeneous initial and forcing conditions this allowed highlighting the processes that are better represented in the coupled system in the present work the same synthetic framework is used a 50 m resolution digital terrain model dtm is used to determine the topography of the watershed a uniform soil texture is imposed the initial soil moisture is set homogeneously the rainfall forcing is a uniform rainfall rate over the whole watershed during a single rainy event lasting 20h with an intensity of 18 mm h 1 the sensitivity studies vary the hydrodynamic parameters the initial soil moisture content and the soil texture according to the multiple hypotheses enunciated above the sensitivity to the routing module which manages the transfer of runoff water from a point of a catchment to its outlet is not considered here see section 2 1 table 2 lists the experiments for each experiment three initial soil moisture conditions are considered very low to simulate very dry or water stress soils swi 0 or intermediate swi 0 5 or equal to w fc to consider wet initial soils swi 1 with swi the soil water index 4 swi w w wilt w fc w wilt using swi allows initializing the same moisture conditions regardless of the soil texture the importance of the initial soil moisture is first pointed out comparing the two ptf sets for isba top simulations a control experiment called a ctrl is performed with isba top using ch 78 ptf the same using co 84 ptf is called a co 84 the sensitivity to the watershed morphology is evaluated using two different watersheds the gardons river at remoulins and the ardèche river at vallon pont d arc the latter is a round shaped catchment contrary the first one which is more elongated the fraction of clay and sand are set to an averaged value 33 of sand and 32 of clay for the cévennes region uniformly over the whole watershed except for ah ctrl and ah co 84 for these experiments the uniform soil texture is replaced by the hwsd harmonized world soil database nachtergaele et al 2008 database soil texture at each grid mesh the resolution of the hwsd database is 1 km ah ctrl and ah co 84 allow studying the sensitivity to the soil texture variability fig 1bc shows the fraction of clay and sand over the simulation domain to study the sensitivity to the hydrodynamic parameters a series of experiments are performed the parameters are modified using 6 values equally spaced within their corresponding range and one parameter at the time the min max range is given in table 1 for each parameter those experiments are called with the name of the modified parameter and index from 1 to 6 this approach is a low cost simplistic one but it allows benefiting from the past studies on the parameters values the parameters covariance is considered a posteriori computing an inter correlation to assess the sensitivity statistical scores are computed for each experiment with respect to the a ctrl experiment see appendix b for their definition the scores allow characterizing the difference between each experiment and the reference 2 2 2 real events configuration the sensitivity study is then pursued using real event experiments this allows confronting the simulated discharges with measurements keeping in mind that the latter are also uncertain four watersheds of the cévennes vivarais area have been considered the vidourle river at salinelles the gardons river at boucoiran the cèze river at bagnols and the ardèche river at vallon pont d arc see fig 1 a the model configuration is the same as the one of the synthetic a experiments except that the soil texture comes from the hswd database and the land cover type comes from the ecoclimap ii physiographic data faroux et al 2013 masson et al 2003 soil moisture is initialized by the hydrometeorological safran isba modcou sim analysis habets et al 2008 sim provides hourly swi and soil temperatures at 8km resolution over france these data are disaggregated over a 1km 1km grid over the cévennes domain simply giving to the 1km meshes the value of the corresponding 8km mesh and serve as initial soil conditions for isba top simulations however isba top simulations are started two days before the beginning of the heavy precipitation events to allow the soil water conditions to be balanced before the evnet this 2 day spin up delay has been deduced by bouilloud et al 2010 finally isba top is driven with 1 km 2 quantitative precipitation estimates that come from a merging of radar data and raingauges measurements laurantin 2008 several recent real events have been selected from 2011 to 2014 see table 3 the events have been chosen to sample the variety of rainfall intensity and duration as well as the hydrological response of the rivers encountered in the area table 3 also inform about the antecedent soil moisture conditions in this region amounts of rainfall of more than 200mm in 24h are collected at least once a year the 2 years return periods for specific discharges are between 0 48 m 3 s 1 km 2 for the cèze river at bagnols and 0 76 m 3 s 1 km 2 for the ardèche river at vallon pont d arc for each event a reference experiment hereafter called ctrl consists in using isba top with the ch 78 ptf and the associated m value then the values of each parameter are varied within their range interval as in the synthetic experiments using the same six multiplicative coefficients the names chosen for each experiments are given in table 2 as some of the hydrodynamic parameters are interrelated it is needed to study the correlation between each pair of parameters instead of computing a classical correlation coefficient between two hydrographs a likelihood measure including various types of criteria has been chosen the lnp score described by roux et al 2011 appendix b is thus used to assess the inter correlation between the sensitivity experiments of table 2 in the real events configuration lnp has been computed between each sensitivity simulation from w sat 1 to m 6 in table 2 and and all the 41 others for each real event and each catchment the mean value of lnp for all the events and catchments is then computed for a given sensitivity simulation 5 lnp 1 e e 1 e lnp e where lnp e is the lnp for a given simulation a given event and a given catchment e is the total number of simulations for a given parameter and a given multiplicative coefficient e 24 6 events 4 catchments so a value of lnp is obtained for a parameter and a multiplicative coefficient 3 results of the sensitivity experiments 3 1 synthetic framework figs 2 a and c show the simulated discharges from the three different soil moisture states for a ctrl and a co 84 experiments for the remoulins catchment and for the vallon pont d arc respectively the initial soil moisture has a large impact on the hydrological response both in terms of dynamics and peak flow amplitude as obviously expected on the contrary changing the ptf function has a slight impact on the simulated discharges for the two watersheds using co 84 instead of ch 78 leads to a slight increase of the simulated discharge for dry soils swi 0 or at the beginning of the simulation starting from swi 0 5 whereas the opposite impact is obtained for moist soils swi 1 or in the second part of the simulation starting from swi 0 5 considering the realistic soil heterogeneity given by hwsd database instead of a uniform soil texture changes slightly those conclusions fig 2 b and d first co 84 ptf simulations show lower discharges than the ctrl ptf secondly the difference in peak amplitude using ctrl or co 84 is higher with hwsd soil textures than with the uniform soil textures especially for simulations starting from swi 1 for instance the comparison of the a ctrl and ah ctrl experiments i e with a uniform soil and with hwsd soil texture respectively for remoulins catchment and swi 0 5 shows different hydrographs this can be explained by the hwsd soil texture shown in fig 1 b and c the highest part of the remoulins catchment north western part is mainly sandy whereas the fraction of clay is higher in the lowest part of the catchment south eastern part this gradient of soil texture implies a different hydrological behaviour along a northwest southeast axis these synthetic experiments show that both ch 78 and co 84 ptfs used in isba top lead to close results for the two watersheds the same is obtained when varying the forcing field reducing the duration of the rainfall and increasing the rainfall intensity not shown only the soil texture heterogeneity leads to differences in peak flows amplitude the differences between a ctrl results and the experiments where a single hydrodynamic parameter is varied are compared to assess the impact of each parameter individually on discharge simulation fig 3 illustrates the scores obtained for the experiment series varying wwilt a wwilt i the largest impact is obtained when swi 0 initially this is also true for all the other experiments series the comparison between each parameter impact is thus shown here for initial swi 0 only fig 4 the parameters k sat and w sat have the highest impact for the four scores whereas b and ψ sat have the lowest one m and wfc have very low impact for the peak amplitude bias and mape scores but varying their values has an impact on the timing of the flow peak the impact of wwilt is lower than the one of k sat or w sat but remains quite high to sum up the differences are higher for initial swi 0 and parameters k sat and w sat have the highest impact on discharge simulations the impact of w sat was expected of course since its value conditions the soil storage capacity and is a threshold over which water runs off rather than being stocked the lower w sat is the less the soil can stock water the impact of k sat is due to its involvement in darcy s law water hardly infiltrates the soil for low values of k sat which favours horton runoff on the contrary high values of k sat make easy water infiltration and the saturation level can be reached rapidly depending on the soil water content and the recharge value in this case dunne runoff is favoured however as the soil texture heterogeneity is crucial for the hydrological response of the watershed the respective impact of the parameters has to be confirmed and ranked using real events which exhibit heterogeneities 3 2 real events experiments fig 5 illustrates the simulated discharges for event 6 and the ardèche river at vallon pont d arc first varying the parameters does not change the peaks timing which is controlled by the routing module of isba top on the contrary the peak amplitudes can be strongly modified when some of the parameters are modified the parameters k sat and w sat have the highest impacts as found previously with the synthetic case varying the other parameters does not change much the flow peak amplitude except for m the same scores are computed as for the synthetic experiments except the reference which is given by observations fig 6 shows an example for the event 3 and the catchment of the gardons river at ners for this event and this catchment the difference of phase δ t max remains very low regardless of the simulation fig 6a w sat is the parameter whose modification has the highest impact on the flow peak amplitude fig 6b but also on the whole hydrograph fig 6 c and d m values have a significant impact on the amplitude of the peak flow δ q max but almost no effect on the other scores the impact of k sat is visible on the δ q max and the bias scores this ranking of the impact of the parameters depends however on the event catchment and considered score fig 7 synthesizes the distribution box plots of mape scores by parameter for all the events and all the catchments clearly k sat and w sat are the parameters that have the largest impacts followed by m same ranking is obtained for δ q max and bias scores not shown lnp has been used to assess the inter correlation between the hydrographs simulated for each sensitivity simulation from w sat 1 to m 6 fig 8 represents lnp between a given sensitivity simulation in the x axis and another one in y axis for all catchments and events low values are plotted in red or black colours whereas high values are in green or white the simulations varying k sat or w sat give hydrographs little correlated with the ones produced by experiments varying the other parameters the simulations varying m also show low lnp on the contrary the other experiments lead to close results since lnp values are close to one to sum up varying the parameters within their range interval leads to significant different hydrographs for k sat w sat and m each of those three parameters indeed are involved in runoff production w sat constitutes clearly a threshold if the soil water content exceeds w sat runoff is produced so low values of w sat favour saturation runoff production the impact of k sat is more complex and less linear infiltration excess overland flow is favoured for the low values of this parameter whereas saturation excess runoff is eased for high values of k sat the prevailing process depends of the value of the antecedent soil moisture last m impacts the soil water vertical motion and lateral fluxes as a consequence high values of m lead to a rapid saturation of watersheds downstream areas where saturation excess runoff can occur 4 probabilistic modelling system 4 1 design of an ensemble modelling system an ensemble modelling system is designed based on the results of the previous sensitivity study i only the parameters that have a high impact on the hydrological response are perturbed and ii the initial soil moisture is perturbed together with the parameters 4 1 1 perturbation of parameters the parameters are randomly perturbed within their range interval following a uniform distribution the physical coherence of each parameter is kept however for instance w wilt w fc w sat in a first ensemble that is called ap ensemble all the parameters described in section 2 1 are perturbed in another ensemble called 3 p the three most sensitive parameters k sat w sat and m are perturbed comparing both ensemble aims at verifying that the skill is not deteriorated when perturbing only the three parameters that have the highest impact for each method a hundred of perturbed parameter datasets are used to produce an ensemble of 100 simulations 4 1 2 perturbation of initial soil moisture the method designed by bouttier et al 2015 to generate perturbation of the surface fields of the meteorological ensemble prediction system arome eps is used here for the soil moisture field indeed as isba is part of the surface scheme of arome it seems consistent to use the same method for isba top the perturbation spatial pattern random numbers uniformly distributed over the domain is smoothed in order to obtain two dimension isotropic gaussian auto correlations each grid point has a gaussian distribution with spatially constant mean and standard deviation the mean is a random value between 0 7 and 1 3 this range has been tuned several ranges have been tried a too narrow range produces perturbed fields close to the original one on the contrary for a wide range the physical limits of the fields are reached too easily fig 9 provides an example of perturbation fields that are generated the soil moisture field is multiplied by this random field note that the values are not allowed to be greater than w sat the isba top simulations always start two days before the beginning of the studied events since a 2 day spin up is observed before reaching the soil moisture balance in real event configuration bouilloud et al 2010 the soil moisture field is randomly perturbed after this 2 day adaptation first an ensemble of hundred simulation members called cdi is obtained from 100 perturbed initial moisture fields then another ensemble of 100 members is built combining the perturbed initial conditions and the three model parameters perturbations called 3 pcdi the latter consists in perturbing randomly and independently initial conditions and each of the three sensitive parameters 100 times to approximate a proper sampling of the uncertainty it is not a selection within the 3 p and cdi ensembles finally the number of members of the 3 pcdi ensemble has been varied from n 10 to 20 30 50 the ensembles are called 3 pcdi n 4 2 results of the isba top ensemble version fig 10 shows an example of the ensemble obtained for event 4 on the four catchments with 20 members of the 3 pcdi ensemble the red line represents the hourly discharges simulated using the deterministic version of the model ctrl experiment and the grey ones are the time series obtained with the ensemble version of isba top for 20 members the discharge observations are generally included in the envelope of the different simulated scenarios especially when the simulations from deterministic version mismatch the discharge observations for instance the deterministic version leads to an underestimation of the first flow peak of the ardèche river and an overestimation of the last flow peak for the cèze river in both cases the ensemble version succeeds in proposing scenarios that match better with the observations some statistical probabilistic scores rpss rmse and σ have been computed to compare the various ensembles see appendix b for rpss the reference experiment is ctrl experiment table 4 gives the values of rpss rmse σ and σ rmse ratio for the different ensembles all the rpss values are positive showing a positive impact of an ensemble version of isba top against the deterministic one the perturbation of the three most sensitive parameters leads to higher rpss than the perturbation of all the parameters but the rmse is higher with 3 p than ap ensemble and the 3 p ensemble is more under dispersive than the ap ensemble lower σ rmse ratio perturbing only initial soil moisture leads to a lack of spread and lower values of rpss compared to the other ensembles but when both parameters and initial soil moisture are perturbed 3 pcdi scores almost as good as ap are obtained this result is obtained for the 100 member ensembles fig 11 shows the evolution of rpss for the ap 3 p and 3 pcdi ensembles modifying the number of members which is to say the number of random perturbations decreasing the number of members leads to a slight decrease of the rpss but the order of magnitude of the score remains unchanged always better that perturbing only the initial soil moisture this trend is less pronounced with the 3 pcdi ensemble than when perturbing only the parameters 3 p or ap the increase of rpss score is larger when going from 10 to 20 members than when further enlarging the ensemble size the other scores evolve in the same way when increasing the number of members finally performing 20 executions of the perturbation method is a good compromise in terms of cost and ensemble performance this will be usefull when using members of a meteorological eps to drive the perturbed hydrological model 5 conclusions hydrological ensemble prediction systems are becoming more and more popular in order to take the uncertainty that affects flood forecasting into account for the specific issue of mediterranean flash floods some systems are based on the use of meteorological ensembles to drive hydrological models such a heps based on the isba top system is currently under construction however other sources of uncertainty affect also flood forecasting especially uncertainty in hydrological modelling the final aim will be to complete the heps considering uncertainty on rainfall using members of an convection permitting atmospheric ensemble prediction system and uncertainty on model parameters and initial state this paper describes the design process of the hydrological part of such an heps considering the uncertainty that affects hydrological model parameters on the one hand and the initial soil moisture on the other hand based on the isba top system to do so the uncertainty on rainfall forcing is not considered and rainfall fields provided by radar and raingauges observations are used as perfect rains a preliminary step is a sensitivity study that aims to establish the hydrodynamic parameters that impact isba top simulations the most first synthetic experiments are carried out to answer several questions it confirms that some hydrodynamic parameters impact more discharge simulations than others and that this impact depends on how moist is the soil at the beginning of the simulation the synthetic study also shows that the soil texture heterogeneity plays a key role in discharge simulations this pleads for analysing real event simulations to be able to rank the impact of the different parameters in a second part of the sensitivity analysis varying the parameter values to simulate discharges of four rivers on six real events points out that isba top is very sensitive to w sat k sat and m parameters these parameters might be really sensitive for any hydrological model especially when used for ff simulations perturbing those parameters together with the initial soil moisture field allows obtaining an ensemble discharge simulation from a deterministic rainfall forcing scenario this system has now to be fully assessed on more real events and catchments the preliminary tests concerning the number of members needed to properly sample the modelling uncertainty tend to show that the statistical scores remain of the same order of magnitude reducing the number of members from 100 to 10 this result should be confirmed using more events and catchments the next step will be to take the routing module uncertainty into account it would be interesting also to consider the model structure uncertainty the latter can be sampled using several hydrological models or dressing the outputs of the model the methods based on the post processing techniques are based on empirical dressing from past error distributions the latter have to be replayed at each new version of the model which is quite computationally consuming for physically based models such as isba top the perturbation of the sensitive parameters as proposed in the present study on the contrary will keep valuable even with new model versions it would be however interesting to compare the new ensemble isba top system with a multi model ensemble last but not least all the components of the heps will be put together to consider different sources of uncertainty that affect the chain to do so the hydrological model will be perturbed as proposed in the present paper and driven by the members of a convection permitting eps such as arome eps issues about how to combine the meteorological members and the perturbations of the hydrological model and initial soil moistures or about how many scenarii are necessary to obtain satisfactory spread and ensemble central tendency will arise

7357,intense precipitation events in the mediterranean often lead to devastating flash floods ff ff modelling is affected by several kinds of uncertainties and hydrological ensemble prediction systems heps are designed to take those uncertainties into account the major source of uncertainty comes from rainfall forcing and convective scale meteorological ensemble prediction systems can manage it for forecasting purpose but other sources are related to the hydrological modelling part of the heps this study focuses on the uncertainties arising from the hydrological model parameters and initial soil moisture with aim to design an ensemble based version of an hydrological model dedicated to mediterranean fast responding rivers simulations the isba top coupled system the first step consists in identifying the parameters that have the strongest influence on ff simulations by assuming perfect precipitation a sensitivity study is carried out first using a synthetic framework and then for several real events and several catchments perturbation methods varying the most sensitive parameters as well as initial soil moisture allow designing an ensemble based version of isba top the first results of this system on some real events are presented the direct perspective of this work will be to drive this ensemble based version with the members of a convective scale meteorological ensemble prediction system to design a complete heps for ff forecasting keywords flash floods uncertainty ensemble hydrodynamic parameters initial soil moisture 1 introduction the western mediterranean region is regularly affected by devastating flash floods ff due to heavy precipitation events ricard et al 2012 especially during the autumn months this affects the lives of thousands of people and cause extensive and costly damage llasat et al 2012 gaume et al 2009 several works intend to improve ff forecasting around the world recent examples can be found in china miao et al 2016 in the us hardy et al 2016 in saudi arabia tekeli and fouli 2016 and around the mediterranean ferraris et al 2002 amengual et al 2008 vincendon et al 2011 vié et al 2012 artinyan et al 2016 for instance in the framework of the international hymex hydrological cycle in mediterranean experiment program drobinski et al 2014 ducrocq et al 2014 it remains particularly challenging to model and forecast ff first rainfall forcing data are needed at time and space scales relevant to the hydrologic process of interest typically at least 1h 1 km 2 but the use of sub hourly rainfall can be beneficial rainfall estimates are uncertain and rainfall forecasts even more and these uncertainties propagate all along the hydro meteorological modelling chain pappenberger et al 2005 zappa et al 2010 second accurate information about initial soil moisture conditions included the space distribution among the watershed is required rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 but is seldom well known especially at kilometric resolutions brocca et al 2008 then provided that proper rainfall forcing and initial soil moisture states are available hydrological models themselves introduce uncertainty indeed some physical processes are not or partially represented by the model equations many processes are not linear and some of them are subject to threshold effects beyond this model structure uncertainty hydrological models parameters are uncertain beven and binley 1992 vrugt et al 2003 moradkhani et al 2005 refsgaard et al 2012 too consequently various types of uncertainty affect the whole hydrometeorological modelling chain to address this question hydrological ensemble prediction systems heps have been developed in particular within coordinated initiatives such as cost731 zappa et al 2010 map d phase rotach et al 2009 or hepex hydrological ensemble prediction experiment schaake et al 2007 thielen et al 2008 among others many heps are based on the use of ensemble precipitation prediction to drive a hydrological model bartholomes and todini 2005 siccardi et al 2005 thielen et al 2009 vincendon et al 2011 they do not consider uncertainty inherent in hydrological modelling and initial soil conditions data assimilation techniques can be used to reduce or quantify the uncertainty on model states abaza et al 2014 noh et al 2014 the uncertainty on hydrological model structure and parameters is rather managed through post processing analysis solomatine and shrestha 2009 bogner and pappenberger 2011 biondi and de luca 2012 that consists of adjusting the hydrological model outputs by estimating the probability distribution of the model error zalachori et al 2012 compare several bias correction strategies a lot of them rely on bayesian framework krzysztofowicz 1999 todini 2008 reggiani et al 2009 among others ensemble empirical dressing approaches or regression analysis are also used to post process model outputs olsson and lindstrom 2008 weerts et al 2011 boucher et al 2012 zalachori et al 2012 hashino et al 2007 among others those methods consider the hydrological model uncertainty as a whole or the total chain uncertainty using several hydrological models is a way to consider model structure ambiguities georgakakos et al 2004 velazquez et al 2010 it is not common however that heps are built on the basis of perturbation of parameters liu et al 2012 the relative influence of uncertainties from different sources initial moisture conditions model structure or parameters and the way to consider them to build a heps remains an open question in the field of ff modelling zhang et al 2016 indeed the physical processes involved in ff generation are small time and space scales ones so they deserve particular attention disentangling the different sources of uncertainty is required to be able to both identify and rank them the major uncertainty in ff forecasting comes from the rainfall forecast the latter can be sampled using convection permitting meteorological ensemble prediction systems when focusing on the hydrological uncertainty an appropriate and simple methodology is to use the hydrometeorological forecasting chain in a simulation mode using observed rainfall forcing fields and considering them as perfect rain it thus produces an ensemble discharge simulation from a single rainfall scenario mediero et al 2011 using this approach the present study looks at the sensitivity of model outputs to its hydrodynamic parameters and initial soil moisture conditions the hydrometeorological forecasting chain considered for this study relies on the isba top modelling system bouilloud et al 2010 this system is already part of an heps that considers the uncertainty on rainfall forcing using multiple members coming from a convection permitting numerical weather prediction model vincendon et al 2011 the final aim of the present work is to complement this heps addressing the issue of hydrological uncertainty model parameters and initial state the first step of the study consists in identifying which parameters have the strongest impact on the discharge simulations model parameters are however interrelated which makes difficult a sampling of the distribution of the different parameters liu et al 2012 clark et al 2011 pointed out also that data uncertainty constrains our ability to discriminate among competing hydrological hypotheses to overcome these difficulties a multiple working hypotheses fenicia et al 2008 clark et al 2011 framework is used here the influence of model parameters is studied first in a synthetic set up with perfect rain that allows neglecting the uncertainty coming from rainfall inputs and space heterogeneity for instance this permits to answer several questions i which parameters have more impact than others on ff modelling ii does the impact of each individual parameters depend on the initial soil moisture iii does the heterogeneity of the soil texture need to be considered when evaluating the sensitivity to the parameters in a second part the sensitivity analysis is complemented with real events simulations to rank the impact of the various model parameters then based on the sensitivity analysis results the most sensitive model parameters are perturbed together with the initial soil moisture field to produce ensemble discharge simulations finally the skill of the proposed ensemble has been assessed this study will allow to identify the sensitive parameters of a coupled hydrological model and to design an ensemble based system dedicated to ff modelling based on the parameters and initial conditions uncertainty this will contitute a component of a more general heps dealing also with rainfall uncertainty by the use of a meteorological ensemble the results and method reported in this paper could be usefull for designing others heps in the context of ff forecasting the outline of this paper is as follows the model and the methodology are presented in section 2 results are discussed in section 3 conclusions and future work are presented in the last section 2 data model and methodology 2 1 isba top model and its parameters the isba top system a physically based model developed at the french national centre for meteorological research the acronym in french is cnrm is a coupling between the land surface model isba noilhan and planton 1989 and topodyn pellarin et al 2002 a version of the hydrological model topmodel beven and kirkby 1979 which improves the simulation of flash floods in mediterranean regions isba is a surface scheme that deals with water and energy budgets on a rectangular domain divided into 1 km 2 meshes it governs the overall budget across soil columns the watersheds are described based on a 50m digital terrain model dtm topmodel computes the sub surface lateral water fluxes and space time dynamics of the saturated areas using the watershed topography isba top is designed to simulate fields of all the water budget components evaporation runoff soil water contents the routing module is based on a geomorphological method le lay et al 2008 to transfer water from any point of the catchment to the nearest point of the river and then along the river up to the outlet it makes use of speeds of transfer on the hillslopes and in the river calibrated by bouilloud et al 2010 by a comparison between simulated and observed discharges chronics the uncertainty that affects this part of the model will be considered in a future work once the new version of this routing module developed by artinyan et al 2016 is implemented on the studied region bouilloud et al 2010 fully describe the original version of isba top the version used in this study has been deeply updated from the original version and is described in vincendon et al 2016 the isba df soil multilayer diffusion scheme boone et al 2000 decharme et al 2011 is used in this new version most of the soil hydrodynamic parameters used in isba top can be derived from soil surveys through pedotransfer function ptf approaches even the m parameter that is inherited from the topmodel approach is now derived from the ptf the two parameters that needed to be calibrated are not used anymore in this new isba top version it thus makes easier using isba top for any catchment especially ungauged small ones with satisfactory results vincendon et al 2016 discuss the advantages of this new isba top version fig 1 a shows the simulation domain studied in the present work isba top relies on the following hydrodynamic parameters the volumetric water content at saturation w sat which is reached when all soil pores are filled with water the water content at the wilting point w wilt which is reached when there is not enough water in the soil to meet the plant s needs the field capacity w fc which is the amount of water remaining in the soil after excess water has drained and the downward movement rate has decreased the saturated hydraulic conductivity k sat which describes how easily water can move through saturated soil it characterizes the flow speed for darcy s law the soil matric potential at saturation ψ sat which is the potential energy of water in saturated soil it characterizes the suction energy the parameter b is a dimensionless shape parameter of the soil water retention curve which links the matric potential ψ and the soil volumetric water content w using the brooks and corey 1966 model together with the relationships from clapp and hornberger 1978 1 ψ w ψ sat w w sat b k ψ k sat ψ ψ sat 2 b 3 b k w k sat w w sat 2 b 3 for a given soil water content w as w w sat is always lower or equal to 1 the higher b is the smaller the conductivity of water in the soil is the rate of decrease of the transmissivity m for a given soil depth d the transmissivity at this depth t d is given by 2 t d t 0 e d m with t 0 the transmissivity at the soil surface that is linearly linked to k w at the soil surface and m given by 3 m w sat w fc 4 this formulation of m comes from the original coupling isba top bouilloud et al 2010 4 is the default value for the exponential decay factor of the saturated hydraulic conductivity so the lower m is the lower the transmissivity t d is the values of these soil hydrodynamic parameters are derived from soil surveys through pedotransfer function ptf approaches several sets of ptfs were proposed in past studies clapp and hornberger 1978 but also cosby et al 1984 carsel and parrish 1988 and wösten et al 1999 among others related soil hydrodynamic parameters to the soil fraction of sand silt and clay and organic matter content two of those sets are implemented in isba df clapp and hornberger 1978 and cosby et al 1984 ones referred to herein as ch 78 and co 84 respectively for succinctness see a for a detailed description they both link each hydrological parameter to the percentage of sand and a percentage of clay table 1 gives an example of the values of the hydrodynamic parameters for a given percentage of sand and clay for ch 78 and co 84 ptfs so has to inform about the gap between the values obtained with both ptfs the range interval informs about the minimum and maximum values it has been obtained from the literature about field experiments 2 2 sensitivity experiments 2 2 1 synthetic framework clark et al 2011 recommended a multiple hypotheses framework to enable testing individual modelling options in order to attribute differences of the overall model performance to a specific modelling decision the aim of the present experiments is to assess i if some parameters have more impact than others ii if the impact of each individual parameters depends on the initial soil moisture and iii if the heterogeneity of the soil texture has to be considered in the sensitivity analysis those issues are adressed using a synthetic configuration for isba top simulations much simpler than real events configuration a first advantage is to neglect of data dependency resolution uncertainty another is that it allows running the isba top model many times at a low computational cost indeed rainfall soil characteristics and initial soil moisture are homogeneous so fewer exchanges occur within the model meshes so it runs more rapidly vincendon et al 2010 used such a synthetic framework for studying the benefit of using isba top original coupling rather than isba alone based on experiments using a single catchment with uniform soil texture and homogeneous initial and forcing conditions this allowed highlighting the processes that are better represented in the coupled system in the present work the same synthetic framework is used a 50 m resolution digital terrain model dtm is used to determine the topography of the watershed a uniform soil texture is imposed the initial soil moisture is set homogeneously the rainfall forcing is a uniform rainfall rate over the whole watershed during a single rainy event lasting 20h with an intensity of 18 mm h 1 the sensitivity studies vary the hydrodynamic parameters the initial soil moisture content and the soil texture according to the multiple hypotheses enunciated above the sensitivity to the routing module which manages the transfer of runoff water from a point of a catchment to its outlet is not considered here see section 2 1 table 2 lists the experiments for each experiment three initial soil moisture conditions are considered very low to simulate very dry or water stress soils swi 0 or intermediate swi 0 5 or equal to w fc to consider wet initial soils swi 1 with swi the soil water index 4 swi w w wilt w fc w wilt using swi allows initializing the same moisture conditions regardless of the soil texture the importance of the initial soil moisture is first pointed out comparing the two ptf sets for isba top simulations a control experiment called a ctrl is performed with isba top using ch 78 ptf the same using co 84 ptf is called a co 84 the sensitivity to the watershed morphology is evaluated using two different watersheds the gardons river at remoulins and the ardèche river at vallon pont d arc the latter is a round shaped catchment contrary the first one which is more elongated the fraction of clay and sand are set to an averaged value 33 of sand and 32 of clay for the cévennes region uniformly over the whole watershed except for ah ctrl and ah co 84 for these experiments the uniform soil texture is replaced by the hwsd harmonized world soil database nachtergaele et al 2008 database soil texture at each grid mesh the resolution of the hwsd database is 1 km ah ctrl and ah co 84 allow studying the sensitivity to the soil texture variability fig 1bc shows the fraction of clay and sand over the simulation domain to study the sensitivity to the hydrodynamic parameters a series of experiments are performed the parameters are modified using 6 values equally spaced within their corresponding range and one parameter at the time the min max range is given in table 1 for each parameter those experiments are called with the name of the modified parameter and index from 1 to 6 this approach is a low cost simplistic one but it allows benefiting from the past studies on the parameters values the parameters covariance is considered a posteriori computing an inter correlation to assess the sensitivity statistical scores are computed for each experiment with respect to the a ctrl experiment see appendix b for their definition the scores allow characterizing the difference between each experiment and the reference 2 2 2 real events configuration the sensitivity study is then pursued using real event experiments this allows confronting the simulated discharges with measurements keeping in mind that the latter are also uncertain four watersheds of the cévennes vivarais area have been considered the vidourle river at salinelles the gardons river at boucoiran the cèze river at bagnols and the ardèche river at vallon pont d arc see fig 1 a the model configuration is the same as the one of the synthetic a experiments except that the soil texture comes from the hswd database and the land cover type comes from the ecoclimap ii physiographic data faroux et al 2013 masson et al 2003 soil moisture is initialized by the hydrometeorological safran isba modcou sim analysis habets et al 2008 sim provides hourly swi and soil temperatures at 8km resolution over france these data are disaggregated over a 1km 1km grid over the cévennes domain simply giving to the 1km meshes the value of the corresponding 8km mesh and serve as initial soil conditions for isba top simulations however isba top simulations are started two days before the beginning of the heavy precipitation events to allow the soil water conditions to be balanced before the evnet this 2 day spin up delay has been deduced by bouilloud et al 2010 finally isba top is driven with 1 km 2 quantitative precipitation estimates that come from a merging of radar data and raingauges measurements laurantin 2008 several recent real events have been selected from 2011 to 2014 see table 3 the events have been chosen to sample the variety of rainfall intensity and duration as well as the hydrological response of the rivers encountered in the area table 3 also inform about the antecedent soil moisture conditions in this region amounts of rainfall of more than 200mm in 24h are collected at least once a year the 2 years return periods for specific discharges are between 0 48 m 3 s 1 km 2 for the cèze river at bagnols and 0 76 m 3 s 1 km 2 for the ardèche river at vallon pont d arc for each event a reference experiment hereafter called ctrl consists in using isba top with the ch 78 ptf and the associated m value then the values of each parameter are varied within their range interval as in the synthetic experiments using the same six multiplicative coefficients the names chosen for each experiments are given in table 2 as some of the hydrodynamic parameters are interrelated it is needed to study the correlation between each pair of parameters instead of computing a classical correlation coefficient between two hydrographs a likelihood measure including various types of criteria has been chosen the lnp score described by roux et al 2011 appendix b is thus used to assess the inter correlation between the sensitivity experiments of table 2 in the real events configuration lnp has been computed between each sensitivity simulation from w sat 1 to m 6 in table 2 and and all the 41 others for each real event and each catchment the mean value of lnp for all the events and catchments is then computed for a given sensitivity simulation 5 lnp 1 e e 1 e lnp e where lnp e is the lnp for a given simulation a given event and a given catchment e is the total number of simulations for a given parameter and a given multiplicative coefficient e 24 6 events 4 catchments so a value of lnp is obtained for a parameter and a multiplicative coefficient 3 results of the sensitivity experiments 3 1 synthetic framework figs 2 a and c show the simulated discharges from the three different soil moisture states for a ctrl and a co 84 experiments for the remoulins catchment and for the vallon pont d arc respectively the initial soil moisture has a large impact on the hydrological response both in terms of dynamics and peak flow amplitude as obviously expected on the contrary changing the ptf function has a slight impact on the simulated discharges for the two watersheds using co 84 instead of ch 78 leads to a slight increase of the simulated discharge for dry soils swi 0 or at the beginning of the simulation starting from swi 0 5 whereas the opposite impact is obtained for moist soils swi 1 or in the second part of the simulation starting from swi 0 5 considering the realistic soil heterogeneity given by hwsd database instead of a uniform soil texture changes slightly those conclusions fig 2 b and d first co 84 ptf simulations show lower discharges than the ctrl ptf secondly the difference in peak amplitude using ctrl or co 84 is higher with hwsd soil textures than with the uniform soil textures especially for simulations starting from swi 1 for instance the comparison of the a ctrl and ah ctrl experiments i e with a uniform soil and with hwsd soil texture respectively for remoulins catchment and swi 0 5 shows different hydrographs this can be explained by the hwsd soil texture shown in fig 1 b and c the highest part of the remoulins catchment north western part is mainly sandy whereas the fraction of clay is higher in the lowest part of the catchment south eastern part this gradient of soil texture implies a different hydrological behaviour along a northwest southeast axis these synthetic experiments show that both ch 78 and co 84 ptfs used in isba top lead to close results for the two watersheds the same is obtained when varying the forcing field reducing the duration of the rainfall and increasing the rainfall intensity not shown only the soil texture heterogeneity leads to differences in peak flows amplitude the differences between a ctrl results and the experiments where a single hydrodynamic parameter is varied are compared to assess the impact of each parameter individually on discharge simulation fig 3 illustrates the scores obtained for the experiment series varying wwilt a wwilt i the largest impact is obtained when swi 0 initially this is also true for all the other experiments series the comparison between each parameter impact is thus shown here for initial swi 0 only fig 4 the parameters k sat and w sat have the highest impact for the four scores whereas b and ψ sat have the lowest one m and wfc have very low impact for the peak amplitude bias and mape scores but varying their values has an impact on the timing of the flow peak the impact of wwilt is lower than the one of k sat or w sat but remains quite high to sum up the differences are higher for initial swi 0 and parameters k sat and w sat have the highest impact on discharge simulations the impact of w sat was expected of course since its value conditions the soil storage capacity and is a threshold over which water runs off rather than being stocked the lower w sat is the less the soil can stock water the impact of k sat is due to its involvement in darcy s law water hardly infiltrates the soil for low values of k sat which favours horton runoff on the contrary high values of k sat make easy water infiltration and the saturation level can be reached rapidly depending on the soil water content and the recharge value in this case dunne runoff is favoured however as the soil texture heterogeneity is crucial for the hydrological response of the watershed the respective impact of the parameters has to be confirmed and ranked using real events which exhibit heterogeneities 3 2 real events experiments fig 5 illustrates the simulated discharges for event 6 and the ardèche river at vallon pont d arc first varying the parameters does not change the peaks timing which is controlled by the routing module of isba top on the contrary the peak amplitudes can be strongly modified when some of the parameters are modified the parameters k sat and w sat have the highest impacts as found previously with the synthetic case varying the other parameters does not change much the flow peak amplitude except for m the same scores are computed as for the synthetic experiments except the reference which is given by observations fig 6 shows an example for the event 3 and the catchment of the gardons river at ners for this event and this catchment the difference of phase δ t max remains very low regardless of the simulation fig 6a w sat is the parameter whose modification has the highest impact on the flow peak amplitude fig 6b but also on the whole hydrograph fig 6 c and d m values have a significant impact on the amplitude of the peak flow δ q max but almost no effect on the other scores the impact of k sat is visible on the δ q max and the bias scores this ranking of the impact of the parameters depends however on the event catchment and considered score fig 7 synthesizes the distribution box plots of mape scores by parameter for all the events and all the catchments clearly k sat and w sat are the parameters that have the largest impacts followed by m same ranking is obtained for δ q max and bias scores not shown lnp has been used to assess the inter correlation between the hydrographs simulated for each sensitivity simulation from w sat 1 to m 6 fig 8 represents lnp between a given sensitivity simulation in the x axis and another one in y axis for all catchments and events low values are plotted in red or black colours whereas high values are in green or white the simulations varying k sat or w sat give hydrographs little correlated with the ones produced by experiments varying the other parameters the simulations varying m also show low lnp on the contrary the other experiments lead to close results since lnp values are close to one to sum up varying the parameters within their range interval leads to significant different hydrographs for k sat w sat and m each of those three parameters indeed are involved in runoff production w sat constitutes clearly a threshold if the soil water content exceeds w sat runoff is produced so low values of w sat favour saturation runoff production the impact of k sat is more complex and less linear infiltration excess overland flow is favoured for the low values of this parameter whereas saturation excess runoff is eased for high values of k sat the prevailing process depends of the value of the antecedent soil moisture last m impacts the soil water vertical motion and lateral fluxes as a consequence high values of m lead to a rapid saturation of watersheds downstream areas where saturation excess runoff can occur 4 probabilistic modelling system 4 1 design of an ensemble modelling system an ensemble modelling system is designed based on the results of the previous sensitivity study i only the parameters that have a high impact on the hydrological response are perturbed and ii the initial soil moisture is perturbed together with the parameters 4 1 1 perturbation of parameters the parameters are randomly perturbed within their range interval following a uniform distribution the physical coherence of each parameter is kept however for instance w wilt w fc w sat in a first ensemble that is called ap ensemble all the parameters described in section 2 1 are perturbed in another ensemble called 3 p the three most sensitive parameters k sat w sat and m are perturbed comparing both ensemble aims at verifying that the skill is not deteriorated when perturbing only the three parameters that have the highest impact for each method a hundred of perturbed parameter datasets are used to produce an ensemble of 100 simulations 4 1 2 perturbation of initial soil moisture the method designed by bouttier et al 2015 to generate perturbation of the surface fields of the meteorological ensemble prediction system arome eps is used here for the soil moisture field indeed as isba is part of the surface scheme of arome it seems consistent to use the same method for isba top the perturbation spatial pattern random numbers uniformly distributed over the domain is smoothed in order to obtain two dimension isotropic gaussian auto correlations each grid point has a gaussian distribution with spatially constant mean and standard deviation the mean is a random value between 0 7 and 1 3 this range has been tuned several ranges have been tried a too narrow range produces perturbed fields close to the original one on the contrary for a wide range the physical limits of the fields are reached too easily fig 9 provides an example of perturbation fields that are generated the soil moisture field is multiplied by this random field note that the values are not allowed to be greater than w sat the isba top simulations always start two days before the beginning of the studied events since a 2 day spin up is observed before reaching the soil moisture balance in real event configuration bouilloud et al 2010 the soil moisture field is randomly perturbed after this 2 day adaptation first an ensemble of hundred simulation members called cdi is obtained from 100 perturbed initial moisture fields then another ensemble of 100 members is built combining the perturbed initial conditions and the three model parameters perturbations called 3 pcdi the latter consists in perturbing randomly and independently initial conditions and each of the three sensitive parameters 100 times to approximate a proper sampling of the uncertainty it is not a selection within the 3 p and cdi ensembles finally the number of members of the 3 pcdi ensemble has been varied from n 10 to 20 30 50 the ensembles are called 3 pcdi n 4 2 results of the isba top ensemble version fig 10 shows an example of the ensemble obtained for event 4 on the four catchments with 20 members of the 3 pcdi ensemble the red line represents the hourly discharges simulated using the deterministic version of the model ctrl experiment and the grey ones are the time series obtained with the ensemble version of isba top for 20 members the discharge observations are generally included in the envelope of the different simulated scenarios especially when the simulations from deterministic version mismatch the discharge observations for instance the deterministic version leads to an underestimation of the first flow peak of the ardèche river and an overestimation of the last flow peak for the cèze river in both cases the ensemble version succeeds in proposing scenarios that match better with the observations some statistical probabilistic scores rpss rmse and σ have been computed to compare the various ensembles see appendix b for rpss the reference experiment is ctrl experiment table 4 gives the values of rpss rmse σ and σ rmse ratio for the different ensembles all the rpss values are positive showing a positive impact of an ensemble version of isba top against the deterministic one the perturbation of the three most sensitive parameters leads to higher rpss than the perturbation of all the parameters but the rmse is higher with 3 p than ap ensemble and the 3 p ensemble is more under dispersive than the ap ensemble lower σ rmse ratio perturbing only initial soil moisture leads to a lack of spread and lower values of rpss compared to the other ensembles but when both parameters and initial soil moisture are perturbed 3 pcdi scores almost as good as ap are obtained this result is obtained for the 100 member ensembles fig 11 shows the evolution of rpss for the ap 3 p and 3 pcdi ensembles modifying the number of members which is to say the number of random perturbations decreasing the number of members leads to a slight decrease of the rpss but the order of magnitude of the score remains unchanged always better that perturbing only the initial soil moisture this trend is less pronounced with the 3 pcdi ensemble than when perturbing only the parameters 3 p or ap the increase of rpss score is larger when going from 10 to 20 members than when further enlarging the ensemble size the other scores evolve in the same way when increasing the number of members finally performing 20 executions of the perturbation method is a good compromise in terms of cost and ensemble performance this will be usefull when using members of a meteorological eps to drive the perturbed hydrological model 5 conclusions hydrological ensemble prediction systems are becoming more and more popular in order to take the uncertainty that affects flood forecasting into account for the specific issue of mediterranean flash floods some systems are based on the use of meteorological ensembles to drive hydrological models such a heps based on the isba top system is currently under construction however other sources of uncertainty affect also flood forecasting especially uncertainty in hydrological modelling the final aim will be to complete the heps considering uncertainty on rainfall using members of an convection permitting atmospheric ensemble prediction system and uncertainty on model parameters and initial state this paper describes the design process of the hydrological part of such an heps considering the uncertainty that affects hydrological model parameters on the one hand and the initial soil moisture on the other hand based on the isba top system to do so the uncertainty on rainfall forcing is not considered and rainfall fields provided by radar and raingauges observations are used as perfect rains a preliminary step is a sensitivity study that aims to establish the hydrodynamic parameters that impact isba top simulations the most first synthetic experiments are carried out to answer several questions it confirms that some hydrodynamic parameters impact more discharge simulations than others and that this impact depends on how moist is the soil at the beginning of the simulation the synthetic study also shows that the soil texture heterogeneity plays a key role in discharge simulations this pleads for analysing real event simulations to be able to rank the impact of the different parameters in a second part of the sensitivity analysis varying the parameter values to simulate discharges of four rivers on six real events points out that isba top is very sensitive to w sat k sat and m parameters these parameters might be really sensitive for any hydrological model especially when used for ff simulations perturbing those parameters together with the initial soil moisture field allows obtaining an ensemble discharge simulation from a deterministic rainfall forcing scenario this system has now to be fully assessed on more real events and catchments the preliminary tests concerning the number of members needed to properly sample the modelling uncertainty tend to show that the statistical scores remain of the same order of magnitude reducing the number of members from 100 to 10 this result should be confirmed using more events and catchments the next step will be to take the routing module uncertainty into account it would be interesting also to consider the model structure uncertainty the latter can be sampled using several hydrological models or dressing the outputs of the model the methods based on the post processing techniques are based on empirical dressing from past error distributions the latter have to be replayed at each new version of the model which is quite computationally consuming for physically based models such as isba top the perturbation of the sensitive parameters as proposed in the present study on the contrary will keep valuable even with new model versions it would be however interesting to compare the new ensemble isba top system with a multi model ensemble last but not least all the components of the heps will be put together to consider different sources of uncertainty that affect the chain to do so the hydrological model will be perturbed as proposed in the present paper and driven by the members of a convection permitting eps such as arome eps issues about how to combine the meteorological members and the perturbations of the hydrological model and initial soil moistures or about how many scenarii are necessary to obtain satisfactory spread and ensemble central tendency will arise

7358,lake hayward is one of only about 30 hypersaline lakes worldwide that is meromictic and heliothermal and as such behaves as a natural salt gradient solar pond lake hayward acts as a local groundwater sink resulting in seasonally variable hypersaline lake water with total dissolved solids tds in the upper layer mixolimnion ranging between 56 kg m 3 and 207 kg m 3 and the deeper layer monimolimnion from 153 kg m 3 to 211 kg m 3 this is up to six times the salinity of seawater and thus has the highest salinity of all eleven lakes in the yalgorup national park lake system a program of continuously recorded water temperature profiles has shown that salinity stratification initiated by direct rainfall onto the lake s surface and local runoff into the lake results in the onset of heliothermal conditions within hours of rainfall onset the lake alternates between being fully mixed and becoming thermally and chemically stratified several times during the annual cycle with the longest extended periods of heliothermal behaviour lasting 23 and 22 weeks in the winters of 1992 and 1993 respectively the objective was to quantify the heat budgets of the cyclical heliothermal behaviour of lake hayward during the period of temperature profile logging the maximum recorded temperature of the monimolimnion was 42 6 c at which time the temperature of the mixolimnion was 29 4 c the heat budget of two closed heliothermal cycles initiated by two rainfall events of 50 mm and 52 mm in 1993 were analysed the cycles prevailed for 11 and 20 days respectively and the heat budget showed net heat accumulations of 34 2 mj m 3 and 15 4 mj m 3 respectively the corresponding efficiencies of lake heat gain to incident solar energy were 0 17 and 0 18 respectively typically artificial salinity gradient solar ponds sgsp have a solar radiation capture efficiencies ranging from 0 10 up to 0 30 results from lake hayward have implications for comparative biogeochemistry and its characteristics should aid in identification of other hitherto unknown heliothermal lakes keywords hypersaline lakes heliothermal lakes natural salt gradient solar lakes solar ponds 1 introduction saline lakes are not uncommon features on all continents however natural meromictic lakes are less common hull et al 1989 and less than 200 have been documented walker and likens 1975 stewart et al 2010 lake hayward can be classified as a type ib meromictic lake according to the typology proposed by walker and likens 1975 however their classification does not include consideration of thermal heating characteristics meromictic lakes that are also heliothermal are even rarer and number less than 30 worldwide sonnenfeld and hudec 1980 hull et al 1989 chapter 2 the earliest reports of natural heliothermal lakes date back over a century to hungary kalecsinsky 1901 and lakes in romania schafarzik 1908 maxim 1929 where the salt is derived from near surface salt domes alexe et al 2017 have reviewed the limnology and plankton diversity in the romanian heliothermal lakes and zachara et al 2016 emphasise the unique biogeochemical attributes of a heliothermal lake in washington state sonnenfeld and hudec 1980 note that not all meromictic lakes are heliothermal and proposed a nomenclature of thermal stratification in heliothermal lakes which has been adopted in this paper thus the upper less dense layer is termed the mixolimnion and the deeper dense and hot layer the monimolimnion lake hayward is located in a group of eleven coastal interdunal lakes approximately 100 km south of perth western australia fig 1 all eleven lakes are located within the yalgorup national park in south west western australia where the regional climate is mediterranean with hot and dry summers and temperate wet winters rainfall data from 1982 to 1995 table 1 show annual totals of between 703 and 1075 mm annual class a pan evaporation rates have been shown to be greater than twice the annual rainfall ranging from 1557 to 1913 mm rosen et al 1996 several authors have studied the hydrochemistry limnology and sedimentology of lake hayward and a number of other lakes in the yalgorup lake system burne and moore 1987 burke and knott 1989 moore 1993 rosen and coshell 1992 coshell and rosen 1994 rosen et al 1995 1996 while forbes and vogwill 2016 have investigated the hydrological regime of the adjacent lake clifton in relation to its unique thrombolite reef the eleven lakes form three linear chains oriented in a north south direction parallel to the coast and at a minimum distance of 1 km lake preston and maximum distance of 4 km lake clifton from the indian ocean lake hayward is located about 3 km from the coastline and lies at the southern end of the central chain of eight lakes between the two largest and longest of the system namely lakes clifton and preston fig 2 the eleven lakes range in salinity from brackish to hypersaline with the hypersaline lake hayward consistently having the highest salinity of all eleven noble 2010 this is due to a combination of factors that include high marine aerosol deposition at its near coastal location driven by prevailing onshore winds its low lake bed elevation of about 2 5 m below sea level its low surface water elevation and a regionally flat groundwater hydraulic gradient that limits groundwater and thus solute flow and discharge to the ocean in combination these conditions result in the lake acting as a local groundwater sink and due to evaporative loss being hypersaline the brine density itself ranging between 1 04 and 1 09 also contributes to a reduction in the lake surface water elevation it is considered that marine derived salt has accumulated via aerosol deposition farrington et al 1993 in the yalgorup lake system as a result of the long term hundreds to thousands of years balance between the rates of marine aerosol deposition and the rate of advective discharge of salt return to the ocean by groundwater flow interestingly it is the interplay between these long term quasi stable physical hydrological and hydrogeochemical conditions and the very short term transient annual rainfall cycles that finds a resonance resulting in the heliothermal condition of lake hayward lake hayward is heliothermal for part of its annual hydrological cycle and displays characteristics similar to lago pueblo on el gran roque island in the caribbean hudec and sonnenfeld 1974 a solar pond located on the sinai peninsula por 1968 eckstein 1970 and the pretoria salt pan in south africa ashton and schoeman 1988 the heliothermal characteristics of most of these lakes appear during the wettest part of the year or at other times during the year when rainfall or other low total dissolved solids tds surface inputs are sufficient to reduce the density of the surface layer the disappearance of heliothermal conditions is due to progressive downward mixing of the mixolimnion with the monimolimnion and to some extent evaporation of the mixolimnion during summer while evaporation from the less saline mixolimnion contributes to the collapse of heliothermal conditions in the case of lake hayward the short cyclic occurrence of heliothermal conditions over periods of days must be due primarily to downward mixing and dispersal of the chemocline driven by wind perturbation evaporation is volumetrically insufficient to remove the lower salinity mixolimnion to an extent necessary to dissipate the chemocline in these respects lake hayward is in the terminology of artificially constructed solar ponds a natural salinity gradient solar pond sgsp sonnenfeld and hudec 1980 suggested that the minimum tds contrast between mixolimnion and monimolimnion should be 15 kgm 3 for heliothermal energy entrapment to occur a condition that is exceeded at lake hayward because of the salt concentration gradient lower layers are denser than upper layers even when warmer and full convection over the entire water column that would result in overnight heat loss to the atmosphere is prevented further saline water is opaque to infrared radiation and so heat loss to the atmosphere via back radiation from the monimolimnion is prevented heliothermal lakes develop a deeper heated layer of water due to absorption of solar radiation alone and because saline water is practically opaque in the infrared spectrum the density stratification sets up a condition where heat loss from the deeper heated layer can only occur at low rates by loss to groundwater and heat loss into the lake bed sediments as rainfall occurs onto an exposed dense brine or it is overrun by less dense waters from runoff stratification and the condition for heliothermal behaviour is established the balance between rates of incoming freshwater and its subsequent mixing with the deeper saline water or evaporation off the upper less saline layer water provide either transient or stable conditions sufficient to perpetuate the entrapment of incoming radiation a number of meromictic lakes and reservoirs have been described in australia many of them in tasmania tyler and bukney 1974 king and tyler 1981 victoria timms 1972 and queensland baly et al 1975 bunn and edward 1984 described three of the six permanent lakes on rottnest island western australia as meromictic hot lakes showing winter heating of the hypersaline monimolimnions from about 21 26 c with government house lake reaching the maximum temperature of 28 c groundwater temperatures not reported by bunn and edward 1984 on rottnest island range between 15 and 22 c average 18 1 c sd 1 4n 28 bryan et al 2016 thus the heating effect in the rottnest island lakes is small and could be ascribed to normal solar insolation and so cannot be classified as heliothermal as the monimolimnion heating is only a few degrees above the ambient groundwater temperature burke and knott 1989 noted that south newnham lake that is adjacent to lake hayward fig 1 stratified temporarily in 1987 reaching a temperature of 32 8 c one temperature profile from lake yalgorup whose southern shoreline is 250 m north of lake hayward fig 2 taken in december 1991 indicated bottom temperatures of 38 7 c lake hayward has been the most intensely studied of the three other adjacent hypersaline lakes and together with these reconnaissance measurements indicate that lake hayward is one of a cluster of four heliothermal lakes in the yalgorup national park that includes lakes yalgorup martins tank and newnham north and south considering newnham north and south merge into a single lake at high water level this paper presents a thermal analysis of the meromictic heliothermal behaviour of lake hayward showing the energy budget and solar energy capture efficiencies of two closed heliothermal events in 1993 selected from amongst numerous heliothermal responses during the year the purpose of the paper is to document for the first time detailed observations of the thermal behaviour of a hypersaline heliothermal lake in australia and to present the first detailed thermal balance of any a heliothermal lake the analysis accounts for the observed cyclic heliothermal behaviour in terms of the lake s hydrologic setting salinity regime physical geographic setting and solar energy capture the paper is the first to provide a detailed heat budget and thermal energy transfers of a natural heliothermal lake and explains how periodic short term stratification events causes heliothermal behaviour in a natural hypersaline lake an analysis of thermal efficiency of lake hayward is presented and is found to be within the range of efficiencies of sgsps 2 physical and hydrological setting field methods and data collection 2 1 physical and hydrological setting the yalgorup national park is underlain by an unconfined hypersaline aquifer which is reported to be 20 m thick and covered by a lens of fresh groundwater commander 1988 the satellite image fig 2 of lake hayward shows its physical proximity to lake yalgorup to the north lake preston to the west lake clifton to the east and lake newnham north to the south locations of the temperature thermistor profile and five multilevel piezometer nests are also shown four figures showing the geometry and bathymetric map of lake hayward the corresponding surface area and volume relationships with lake level elevation and actual lake surface area and volumes for 1991 through 1993 are given in the supplementary material to this paper the actual lake area and volumes plots both show spike responses to rainfall events including responses used in detailed analysis of heliothermal events 4 and 6 lake hayward is located in an interdunal depression between lake clifton to its east and lake preston to its west and with the local hydrological boundary at sea level 4 km to the west and its lower elevation in the landscape acts as a groundwater sink at its maximum standing water level lake hayward is 1 3 km long and has a width of 0 5 km the maximum depth is 2 5 m and the maximum surface area is 0 6 km2 during annual seasonal hydrologic cycles from 1991 to 1993 lake hayward s water level fluctuated by approximately 1 m fig 3 and supplementary material throughout the period its water level was consistently 0 3 m below that of lake clifton and below the peel harvey estuary by about 0 3 0 4 m during the summer months and between 0 3 and 0 4 m above it in winter at its greatest depth the bed of lake hayward is approximately 2 5 m below sea level 2 5 m australian height datum ahd and the maximum lake water level decline is to about 0 5 m ahd the seasonal trend in water level in the peel harvey estuary is shown because it is a proxy for sea level that imposes a sea level boundary condition to groundwater at the north eastern side of yalgorup national park this contributes to very flat regional groundwater gradients that in turn diminishes the return of accumulated marine aerosol salt in the lake system via groundwater flow to the ocean noble 2010 confirmed that lake hayward attains the lowest water level of all 11 lakes in the yalgorup lake system and is also the most saline of them all in winter lake hayward lake water levels increase as the lake is fed by direct rainfall local runoff from its beach margins and groundwater inflow fig 2 groundwater enters the lake mainly via seepages along the eastern margin of the lake although peaked or tepee structures found in beach sediments on the western margin of the lake indicate that groundwater could enter the lake from the west as well coshell and rosen 1994 rapid post rainfall rises in lake water level of a few centimetres recede rapidly at a rate higher than can be accounted for by evaporation alone and therefore a majority of the lake level recession following rainfall is due to discharge to groundwater water balance analysis using a simultaneous water solute and isotope mass balance model barr et al 2000 was carried out for the first three months of 1993 i e in the lead up to events 4 and 6 when the lake volume was receding the analysis showed that the rate of recession could be accounted for by lake water discharge via groundwater outflow and evaporation and that this was occurring volumetrically in the ratio of 3 1 evapotranspiration by surrounding vegetation results in groundwater level decline in summer and a corresponding recession of the lake level thus the lake water body exchanges with groundwater at different rates and directions under seasonal conditions a characteristic shown by other shallow lakes and wetlands on the swan coastal plain of western australia townley et al 1993 and turner and townley 2006 2 2 field methods and data collection water level data in lakes hayward and clifton was collected at 30 min intervals using capacitance water level sensors dataflow model 392 dataflow systems pty ltd noosaville qld australia water level data in the peel harvey estuary was obtained from the west australian department of marine and harbours records the bathymetry of lake hayward was obtained by manual depth probing for water depth and differential gps for location water sample profiles were collected from above and below the chemocline at the same location as the temperature recordings fig 2 one litre water samples were collected in hdpe bottles and electrode sensor measurements including ph temperature electrical conductivity and dissolved oxygen were made using a polycarbonate flow through cell that allowed stable measurement of the respective field parameter without contact between water and the atmosphere water samples were pumped to the surface using 12 v centrifugal pumps detailed climate data

station environdata queensland australia located on the eastern shore of the adjacent lake clifton location shown in fig 1 daily rainfall was also measured at the yalgorup national park ranger s station fig 1 temperature profiles from lake hayward were recorded using a profile of thermistor temperature sensors and data loggers wesdata data recorder model 888 every 30 min prior to deployment the thermistors were calibrated accuracy 0 1 c in a temperature controlled water bath using a mercury thermometer over a temperature range of 15 50 c a vertical profile of eight temperature sensors thermistors 1 8 was installed over a depth of 1 6 m at 20 cm intervals thermistor positions spanned a range of depths above and below the thermocline and were located at fixed positions relative to the lake bed sediments the deepest thermistor thermistor 8 was positioned 10 cm above the lake bed sediments events 4 and 6 occurred when the lake was close to its lowest seasonal level after summer and thermistor 1 was 55 and 51 cm respectively below the lake surface at low stages of lake level elevation such as for events 4 and 6 the thermistor depth range covered 80 of the total water depth groundwater temperature data in the vicinity of lake hayward was collected manually from sixteen shallow nested piezometers adjacent to the lake on the central eastern and western margins fig 2 the average groundwater temperature was 18 7 c n 47 sd 1 6 data presented in four figures in the supplementary material to this paper were the physical elements of the data necessary to calculate evaporation from the lake via meteorological and energy budget methods for events 4 and 6 3 meteorological and thermal balance evaporation estimation the principle adopted to validate the thermal analysis for the two closed heliothermal events events 4 and 6 was to calculate evaporation from lake hayward via two independent methods firstly the penman monteith combination method was used based on meteorological data from the climate station at lake clifton secondly evaporation was estimated from the energy budget of lake hayward agreement between evaporation estimated via the independent penman monteith combination and energy budget methods would justify the use of thermal analysis to estimate energy terms of the two heliothermal events and the estimation of the efficiency of solar energy conversion to heat 3 1 penman monteith combination method the penman monteith combination model is widely used to estimate evaporation from water finch and calver 2008 and has recently been shown to produce reliable estimates of evaporation when local physical site and wind function data are available mcjannet et al 2013 the penman monteith equation combines energy budget and mass transfer terms and the following equation mcjannet et al 2013 was used to estimate evaporation epm from the open water surface of lake hayward in mm per day 1 e pm 1 λ δ r nl n ρ c p e sat e a r a δ γ where λ is the latent heat of vapourisation mj kg 1 δ is the slope of the saturation vapour pressure curve at the air temperature kpa c 1 rnl is the net radiation for the lake mj m 2 d 1 n is the change in heat storage in the water body mj m 2 d 1 ρ is the density of air kg m 3 cp is the specific heat of air mj kg 1 c 1 esat and ea are the saturated vapour pressure of the air kpa at the water

short wave rs and net radiation rn were measured over the land surface at the lake clifton climate station because the net radiation was measured over the land surface and not over the water surface of lake hayward the net radiation r nl wm 2 for lake hayward was determined from the measured short wave radiation rs at the lake clifton climate station using the following equation brutsaert 1982 2 r nl r s 1 α s ε s r ld r lu where rs is the measured short wave radiation w m 2 αs is the albedo of the lake surface an assumed value of 0 06 was used brutsaert 1982 εs is the emissivity of the lake

from eq 2 was converted to rnl mj m 2 d 1 in eq 1 by the conversion factor 0 0864 the aerodynamic resistance term ra was calculated using the following equation calder and neal 1984 mcjannet et al 2013 5 r a ρ c p γ f u where f u mj m 2 d 1 kpa 1 is the wind function at 2 m height above ground level which for lake hayward was taken from the general wind function expression of mcjannet et al 2012 with relevant meteorological measurements made over land at the lake clifton climate station and applied to lake evaporation 6 f u 5 78 4 09 u 2 a 0 05 where u2 is the wind speed at 2 m elevation above ground level and a is the area of the lake m2 the availability of continuous meteorological data from the lake clifton climate station allowed evaporation from lake hayward to be calculated at 15 min intervals during heliothermal events 4 and 6 for a hypersaline lake the free water evaporation rate is reduced due to the high ionic concentrations that lower the saturated vapour pressure of the water calculation of evaporation from water bodies with high solute concentrations was based on the method of salhotra et al 1985 in which evaporation from a water body is reduced at high salinities the evaporation reduction factor α due to the elevated salt concentration is given by 7 α β c l e sat ψ e a e sat ψ e a where β cl is the activity coefficient of the saline lake water unitless ψ is the relative humidity and esat and ea are as above the evaporation reduction factor represents the ratio of vapour pressure over salt water to vapour pressure over fresh water at the same temperature thus the expression used for correcting the penman monteith evaporation from lake hayward due to salinity is epmsc αepm and for events 4 and 6 α ranged between 0 79 and 0 92 3 2 lake energy budget the thermal balance or heat budget method is described by anderson 1954 a b harbeck et al 1958 harbeck et al 1959 hughes 1967 sturrock et al 1992 these describe extensive studies on reservoirs and lakes in the united states in australia thermal balance studies have also been completed on a number of large lakes and reservoirs including mundaring wier near perth hoy and stevens 1979 and on perry lakes a small shallow non saline wetland in metropolitan perth rich 2004 the calculation scheme applied to lake hayward was adapted from those of anderson 1954 a b harbeck et al 1958 harbeck et al 1959 hughes 1967 and sturrock et al 1992 as adapted by rich 2004 a thermal balance relates net energy transfer into and out of a water body to changes in stored energy such that the sensible and latent heat lost from the lake surface net incoming radiation net heat transport through other surfaces change in stored heat at lake hayward this was expanded following rich 2004 taking the form 8 e q s q sr q a q ar q bs q rn q dc q rc q se q x ρ l 1 r c t e t b where qs is incoming short wave radiation qsr is reflected short wave radiation qa is incoming long wave radiation qar is

bracketed groups of heat budget terms in the numerator of eq 8 terms are expressed in watts per m2 w m 2 for computational purposes however all q terms in the numerator of eq 8 were expressed as mj m

the lake level response to event 4 rainfall was a 12 cm rise the spike in lake level rapidly receded during the following days at a rate of 6 3 104 m3 d 1 equivalent to 6 3 mm d 1 which significantly exceeded evaporation the volume and corresponding heat content loss from the lake were therefore assigned in the heat budget to the qrc term as lake water recharged to the aquifer at the corresponding heat content of the monimolimnion groundwater inflow qdc was considered to be zero during events 4 and 6 detailed lake water level logger data was not available for event 6 and was reconstructed from available manual measurements given that the initiating rainfall of event 6 was about 70 that of event 4 the qrc volume was scaled accordingly for event 6 the lake bed sediment heat loss term qse is generally regarded as small robertson and barry 1985 and was neglected for the short duration of events 4 and 6 4 results 4 1 hydrogeochemistry fig 4 a and b show the variation in density and tds data respectively collected from the stratified and fully mixed lake from 1991 to the beginning of 1994 including the periods of detailed analysis in 1992 and 1993 the water chemistry of lake hayward is a na mg cl so4 brine similar in ionic composition to seawater reflecting the origin of the salt as marine aerosol deposition rosen et al 1996 the concentration of the conservative ions varies seasonally due to concentration by evaporation over summer and dilution over winter due to rainfall and surface run off from the lake s beach margin fig 2 in march 1991 the tds of the mixolimnion was 206 9 kgm 3 in its mixed state and declined to 55 9 kgm 3 during a period of stratification until october 1991 over the same time the monimolimnion tds was measured at 206 9 kgm 3 when mixed in march 1991 and declined to 194 5 kgm 3 during stratification in october 1991 table 2 fig 4a and b events 4 and 6 can be seen to occur when the lake was close to its peak density and tds in 1993 lake hayward unlike many meromictic lakes is oxygenated in both the mixolimnion and monimolimnion the mixolimnion is generally well oxygenated average 6 7 mgl 1 dissolved oxygen whilst the monimolimnion is generally supersaturated average 11 1 mgl 1 dissolved oxygen table 2 and table 3 this is due to photosynthesis in the benthic microbial communities bmc burke and knott 1989 rosen et al 1995 during the period 1991 1994 the total dissolved solids tds of the mixolimnion ranged from 56 kg m 3 up to 207 kg m 3 and the monimolimnion from 153 kgm 3 to 211 kgm 3 maximum contrasts in tds for the years 1991 1993 were 140 80 and 50 kgm 3 respectively maximum density contrasts were 0 065 0 04 and 0 02 respectively with a maximum density of 1 095 observed in the monimolimnion in 1991 these density and tds contrasts exceed the minimum tds difference of 15 kg m 3 suggested by sonnenfeld and hudec 1980 as the minimum contrast necessary for heliothermal energy capture 4 2 climate data table 1 shows a summary of annual bureau of meteorology climate data temperature rainfall and class a pan evaporation from mandurah 40 km north of lake hayward from 1982 to 1995 showing the annual pan evaporation excess over rainfall during 1993 climate data were collected from the dedicated climate station located on the eastern shoreline of lake clifton fig 1 although meteorological data was recorded for the duration of 1993 for brevity and relevance the data shown in fig 5 a and b are for the time period of the two closed heliothermal events analysed in detail event 4 and event 6 in march and may june 1993 respectively the meteorological data were used to calculate evaporation rates from lake hayward at 15 min intervals during events 4 and 6 using equations 1 and 2 the meteorologically based evaporation estimates were corrected for the effect of high salt concentrations in the lake water and then compared to the independently derived evaporation estimates from the heat budget calculations the top panels in fig 5a and b show the calculated salt corrected evaporation rate e pmsc during events 4 and 6 respectively figs 6 and 7 show recorded temperatures in lake hayward at up to eight thermistor depths at 30 min intervals from early 1992 fig 6 to late 1993 fig 7 the data gap from january to march 1993 was due to a requirement for equipment maintenance where thermistor data traces are not shown it was due to a technical failure of that thermistor to record data daily rainfall data shown in figs 6 and 7 was collected at yalgorup national park ranger s station near lake hayward fig 1 these data are considered representative rainfall falling directly onto the lake surface and the non vegetated beach fig 2 the temperature data show the number of time periods when the lake was alternately thermally stratified or fully mixed during periods of mixing the temperature data converge towards a single lake temperature during periods of lake stratification distinct temperature traces developed depending on the depth of the recording thermistor 4 3 overall thermal conditions in early 1992 the thermal behaviour of lake hayward was characterised by residual stratification from 1991 that was re activated by 30 mm of rainfall in february this is illustrated in fig 6 event 1 and fig 8 a the latter figure showing the temperature difference between the mixolimnion and monimolimnion and its relation to cumulative rainfall during 1992 thermal stratification was progressively collapsing in early 1992 and by early march the lake had attained a fully mixed condition a short period of stratification occurred in early may in response to 40 mm of rainfall fig 6 event 2 this stratification lasted for less than the month of may and had ceased by mid may 1992 this thermal behaviour is similar to the two closed heliothermal events in 1993 event 4 and event 6 that are analysed in detail later rainfall in late may event 2a then initiated the major period of stratification and heating of the monimolimnion for 1992 that persisted for approximately 6 months through winter and into early summer 1992 event 3 has been differentiated into eleven sub events events 3a 3 k when the input of fresh water due to rainfall and local beach runoff exceeded net evaporation lake hayward became thermally and chemically stratified for the rest of its annual cycle due to downward mixing and dispersal of the chemocline driven by wind perturbation and evaporation particularly during summer lake hayward became thermally homogeneous the results show two periods in 1992 when the lake became temporarily stratified due to rainfall events 2 and 3 clearly showing that heliothermal behaviour is initiated by rainfall events lake hayward starts to become thermally stratified within hours of rainfall occurring with the monimolimnion warming by as much as 5 c within several days e g event 2 the amount of rainfall required to trigger these events varies and is dependent upon the pre event ambient temperature of the lake at lower temperatures it appears that smaller amounts of rain are required to trigger thermal stratification 20 march 1993 46 5 mm rainfall lake temperature 22 c 18 may 1993 26 3 mm rainfall lake temperature 18 5 c fig 7 the onset of heliothermal behaviour actually commences with a cooling of the mixolimnion for example in event 2 the mixolimnion cooled by about 2 5 c due to the incident cooler rainwater and beach runoff however this was followed within a few hours by warming of the monimolimnion this behaviour is also seen in events 4 and 6 in 1993 collapse of heliothermal conditions occurs gradually for example just prior to event 3i fig 6 thermistor 5 then at a depth of 1 5 m below the water surface showed a cooling of about 13 c from 33 c to 20 c over three days between 31 october 1992 and 2 november 1992 showing that the mixolimnion was descending through and past the level of thermistor 5 six weeks later in mid december event 3 k the mixolimnion had descended a further 20 cm to and beyond thermistor 6 in 1992 the two deepest thermistors 7 and 8 did not return data at that time although it is likely that the mixolimnion would have descended further in november 1993 similar behaviour re occurred at event 7 g fig 7 where first the shallower thermistor 7 depth to the water surface of 2 13 m and then thermistor 8 depth to the water surface of 2 33 m are seen to converge sequentially over about 2 weeks to the mixolimnion temperature fig 8a and b show the differences between the monimolimnion and mixolimnion temperatures versus cumulative rainfall for 1992 and 1993 respectively comparison of fig 8a and b show the effect of cumulative rainfall in 1992 of 800 mm resulted in maximum temperature differences of between 10 8 c and 17 8 c during september and october in 1993 which had a lower cumulative rainfall of just under 600 mm the maximum temperature differences ranged between 6 0 c and 12 8 c this difference indicates the importance of both annual rainfall amount and its timing on the heliothermal effect and heat accumulation at lake hayward in addition to the extended heliothermal event that commenced in june 1993 event 7 there were four instances recorded earlier in the year the first event fig 7 event 4 occurred in mid march several days of low surface water temperature preceded a rainfall event on 19 march with a recorded total rainfall of 46 5 mm event 4 which resulted in the lake becoming stratified for a period of 10 days finer detail of the thermal behaviour during event 4 are shown in fig 9 a the second occurrence event 5 1 may 1993 initiated a barely perceptible heliothermal response of less than 1 c a third event fig 7 event 6 occurred in mid may when recorded rainfall of 26 3 mm plus two further days of 3 5 and 2 mm rainfall resulted in lake hayward becoming stratified for a period of 10 days strong winds for a period of 36 h from 19 to 20 may did not result in the lake becoming mixed the fourth sub event fig 7 event 6a began on 29 may and lasted for 9 days rainfall over this period consisted of two days of 13 and 15 mm in addition to strong winds a further day with 6 5 mm of rainfall prolonged the stratification until 8 june finer detail of the thermal behaviour during event 6 are shown in fig 9b rainfall on 12 june 10 mm initiated event 7 during which there were numerous sub event events 7a 7 g which overall constituted a period of five months of continuous stratification between events 7d and 7 g the mixolimnion heated up and converged thermally with the monimolimnion at 7 g when the lake became fully mixed in late november 1993 full mixing was preceded by a month of gradual cooling of the monimolimnion fig 7 three days of rainfall on 9 10 and 12 november event 7f also resulted in a minor stratification of the lake 4 4 thermal balance and heat capture for events 4 and 6 fig 9a shows the detailed thermal behaviour of event 4 in response to the 46 5 mm rainfall event on 19 march 1993 the initial response is a 1 2 c cooling at all five recording thermistors as a result of the cool incident rainfall and runoff at the lower air temperature at the time which ranged from 7 to 10 c fig 7a the cooling effect of the initial rainfall and runoff occurs progressively with depth and reached thermistor 2 at 75 cm below the lake surface about 24 h after the onset of rainfall following the rainfall temperatures recorded by thermistors at all five depths rise with the deepest three thermistors 4 7 and 8 rising six degrees from about 22 c to 28 c in the 57 days between event 4 and event 6 the fully mixed lake cooled by about 7 c fig 9 shows the detailed thermal behaviour of event 6 showing a temperature rise from 17 c to 23 c in response to the initial rainfall of 31 mm on 18 5 1993 temperatures converged to about 18 c for about 1 day on 28th may but an additional 25 mm of rain event 6a resulted in re establishment of heliothermal conditions for a further five days for the thermal analysis of event 6 the ten day period from 18 to 28 may is considered the temperature data in fig 9a and b were used to calculate the heat content in megajoules mj for each of the monimolimnion and mixolimnion layers from the temperature responses of the thermistors the mixolimnion of events 4 and 6 was estimated by interpolation to have a thickness of 0 85 m the known lake level mixolimnion and monimolimnion thicknesses and the lake bathymetry allowed volume estimates and hence heat contents of the layers to be calculated see figures in supplementary material the change in heat energy stored in the lake mj m 2 d 1 n in eq 1 and qx in eq 8 was calculated at 15 min intervals from the change in water temperature δt using qx ρ cp δt where ρ is the density of the lake water cp is the heat capacity j kg 1 k 1 and t is the temperature c lake water heat capacities were adjusted for their salt content after sharqawy et al 2010 4 5 evaporation estimates for events 4 and 6 evaporation estimates calculated at 15 min intervals from the salinity corrected penman monteith equation epmsc eqs 1 and 7 and from the heat budget eeb eq 8 for events 4 and 6 summed into daily evaporation totals are shown in fig 10 for event 4 the total epmsc 88 mm and eeb 83 mm and for event 6 epmsc 16 mm and eeb 40 mm event 4 shows excellent agreement between daily summed epmsc and eeb evaporation the agreement is poorer for event 6 noting that the magnitude of evaporation has decreased by a factor of two between events 4 and 6 the most likely cause of the difference between epmsc and eeb in event 6 is poorer synchronisation of evaporation estimates of epmsc and eeb at 15 min intervals as the overall evaporation rate declines due to decreasing net radiation r nl and the term r nl n in eq 1 becomes dominated by n resulting in negative evaporation as seen in fig 10 however the overall consistency between epmsc and eeb is considered acceptable to justify using the method to calculate the efficiency of solar energy capture by the lake 4 6 efficiency of heliothermal heat capture the efficiency of heliothermal heat capture of the two events 4 and 6 was considered by recognising that prior to the heliothermal events the lake was fully mixed and was gaining and losing heat diurnally by normal solar insolation and as such is regarded as the initial baseline thermal condition figs 9a and 11 and 9b and fig 12 for events 4 and 6 respectively during the two heliothermal events when thermal stratification occurred diurnal heat capture and loss of both the monimolimnion and mixolimnion was estimated the cessation of the two events was evidenced by the lake returning to fully mixed conditions as heliothermal heat capture ceased and so a new post event baseline thermal condition of the lake was attained thus the net effect of the heliothermal events could be determined as closed events because the heliothermal events ceased when the lake returned to a new post event fully mixed thermal condition tables 4a and 4b summarise the daily heat budgets of lake hayward during the pre event baseline and heliothermal stages table 4a shows three aspects of the thermal balance of event 4 taken from figs 9a and 11 the pre event heat gains and losses as a baseline comparison heat gain and loss during the net heat gaining stage and the total heat balance fig 9a and b show the relative cumulative heat contents of the mixolimnion and monimolimnion calculated at 15 min intervals for events 4 and 6 respectively along with rainfall amount the cumulative heat content traces commence at a nominal null position on 11 march 1993 for event 4 and at 11 may 1993 for event 6 when on each occasion the lake was fully mixed the seven diurnal temperature cycles between 11 and 19 march 1993 leading up to event 4 are taken as the baseline condition prior to event 4 during this period fig 11 and table 4a show that the lake was gaining on average 3 6 mj m 3 day 1 and losing 6 4 mj m 3 day 1 depending on the particular daily weather condition i e a net loss of about 18 mjm 3 or about 2 8 mj m 3day 1 this corresponds to a total daily heat gain of 13 7 of the input radiation and loss of 38 1 thus the lake is seen to cool figs 7 9a and 11 by heat loss to the atmosphere following event 4 rainfall on 19 march 1993 the lake became thermally stratified almost immediately and the heat contents of the mixolimnion and monimolimnion diverged by 8 mj m 3 during the next 5 days the heat content of the monimolimnion increased almost monotonically by 22 mj m 3 although a daily surge in heat capture is still discernible in the trace although the mixolimnion has a lower heat content it too gains heat which was transferred from the monimolimnion by interface dispersion and mixing the important difference is that the mixolimnion can be seen to loose heat acquired from the monimolimnion at night of between 5 and 10 mj m 3 while the monimolimnion ceases heat gain at night but holds heat gained during the day due to salinity stratification and the opacity of the mixolimnion to infrared radiation on 25 and 26 march 1993 interface dispersion and mixing transferred heat from the monimolimnion and at times heat contents of both monimolimnion and mixolimnion were almost equal from 27 to 29 march 1993 daily heat gain occurred again in the monimolimnion with large excursions in the mixolimnion heat content of 10 15 mj m 3 as heat transferred from the monimolimnion continued via interface dispersion and mixing finally on 30 march 1993 the lake once again became fully mixed and remained so over the date range shown in fig 11 minor heat content excursions can be seen to have occurred in response to smaller rainfall events subsequent to 30 march 1993 in terms of the total event 4 heat budget it is assumed that in the absence of event 4 the lake would have continued to cool during the period 12 march 1993 to 23 march 1993 losing about 2 5 mj m 3 d 1 thus heat captured during heliothermal conditions not only adds to the heat budget but also compensates for heat that otherwise would have been lost to the atmosphere adding a compensation for this to the net heat gain during event 4 i e heat content at the end of event 4 minus that at its beginning the lake made a total heat gain of 10 2 x 106 mj giving a total lake heat gain corresponding to 16 7 of the incoming shortwave radiation the total lake heat gain during event 4 was 34 2 mj m 3 and the net heat gain was 3 1 mj m 3 d 1 the data in table 4a show that during heliothermal conditions the lake actually absorbs no more solar radiation energy than it does during fully mixed i e pre event 4 conditions 3 0 mj m 3 compared to 2 0 mj m 3 but importantly the energy absorbed by the monimolimnion cannot escape to the atmosphere diurnally but accumulates and exchanges slowly to the mixolimnion from which it escapes to the atmosphere the heat differential between monimolimnion and mixolimnion collapses via downward mixing and dispersion of the chemocline and lake hayward again became fully mixed table 4b shows the corresponding data for event 6 because event 6 occurred two months after event 4 and was further into winter the daily solar insolation had declined by at least 20 but due to cloud conditions daily incident solar insolation was about 40 lower than that during event 4 during the six days prior to the onset of event 6 when the lake was fully mixed 12 17 may 1993 there was an average daily heat gain of about 3 7 mj m 3 and an average overnight loss of about 3 4 mj m 3 giving a baseline net daily heat gain of 0 3 mj m 3 thus there was little change in heat content but the daily heat gain of 3 7 mj m 3 was similar to that in event 4 the initiating rainfall event of 18 may 1993 lead to both the monimolimnion and mixolimnion gaining heat at an average rate of 7 3 and 4 1 mj m 3 d 1 respectively but overnight the mixolimnion lost 6 9 mj m 3 d 1 to the atmosphere giving a net heat gain of 1 6 mj m 3 d 1 i e about half that of event 4 and above the pre event 6 baseline heat captured during heliothermal conditions during event 6 does not compensate for ambient heat loss as the pre event 6 fully mixed heat loss was close to zero 0 3 mj m 3 d 1 the total net heat gain to the lake during event 6 was 4 6 106 mj or 15 4 mj m 3 corresponding to a total lake heat gain equal to 18 1 of the incoming solar radiation 5 discussion from studies of lake hayward burke and knott 1989 it was known that the lake became thermally stratified at least once per year but not always at the same time of year or for the same length of time during the summer of 1986 1987 the lake was mixed for a period of 4 months burke and knott 1989 in 1991 1992 lake hayward was mixed for a period of only six weeks there had been relatively high rainfall during the winter of 1991 1075 mm and a relatively cool summer resulting in reduced evaporation rosen et al 1996 for the years 1991 to 1994 when lake temperature data were recorded a positive linear correlation was found between maximum monimolimnion temperature and annual rainfall table 1 which can be expressed as max temp c rainfall mm 0 218 20 5 the correlation is indicative and year to year will be dependent on the timing and magnitude of rainfall distribution within the year at the annual and rainfall event time scale the study has established a clear relationship between rainfall input and the onset and magnitude of transient heliothermal conditions in the absence of surface water inputs as direct rainfall and runoff from the lake s beach the lake can quickly return to a thermally homogenous state and a diurnal pattern of heating and cooling groundwater inflow rainfall and beach runoff on to the lake surface are the only inputs to lake hayward the prevailing winds and rain that originate from over the indian ocean to the west and the rainwater and aerosols carry marine derived ions in the vicinity of lake hayward groundwater inflow is from the northeast but is complicated by density driven reverse flow from lake hayward toward lake clifton evidence for such exchange is given by the fact that groundwater with a total dissolved solids tds of 7 kg m 3 was measured at the base screen depth 20 m depth of the aquifer close to the lake in piezometer 15 rosen et al 1996 mid way between lake hayward and lake clifton fig 2 groundwater with this salinity can only be derived from lake hayward as lake clifton never attains such a high salinity in its annual cycle whereas lake hayward does fig 6a and furthermore exceeds it so that with dilution from local rainfall recharge to groundwater the salinity observed in piezometer 15 can be obtained it is also shown supplementary material from the hydrographic recession of lake level following rainfall events that lake water is released into groundwater thus groundwater exchange with the lake certainly occurs and it is evident that hypersaline lake water released into the aquifer could be returned to the lake later lake hayward becomes stratified because of direct rainfall to the free surface of the lake the effect of the fresh water is to decrease the density and tds of the mixolimnion steepening the density gradient between the mixolimnion and monimolimnion the small surface area of lake hayward results in minimal wind driven mixing and causes a steep salinity gradient from top to bottom results in the formation of stable but temporary stratification downward mixing and dispersion of the mixolimnion is able to dissipate the stratification within a period of days to weeks unless follow up rainfall occurs that re initiates heliothermal conditions unlike other lakes in the yalgorup national park lake hayward is relatively well protected from the effects of the wind induced mixing by medium sized eucalyptus trees located around the lake margins storms with accompanying strong winds are common along the coast during winter and yet stratification is most persistent over the wet winter period the water clarity of lake hayward is generally very high with visibility to the lake bottom when not obscured by the benthic microbial communities which periodically lift off the lake bed and float up to the chemocline solar energy is absorbed at the deeper levels of the lake and can only escape by conductive heat transfer hull et al 1989 the thermal efficiency of sgsps has been defined as the ratio of total thermal energy extracted to the total solar radiation that falls on the pond s surface over a specified interval sgsps are capable of achieving temperatures of 80 103 c dorn 1980 due to the optimised nature of their construction surface area depth and the salinity contrast and thickness of the mixolimnion and monimolimnion several authors have defined the efficiency of the solar pond from the point of view of the thermal energy stored in the system relative to the incident radiation kooi 1979 analysed the steady state salt gradient solar pond and showed theoretically that the maximum efficiency of salt gradient ponds with depths of 1 to 2 m is in the range 0 35 0 40 nie et al 2011 used thermal data from an artificial the solar pond in tibet to deduce its thermal efficiency ranged from 0 07 to 0 31 depending on seasonal conditions karakilcik et al 2006 report the highest thermal efficiencies were obtained in august as 0 05 for the upper convective zone 0 14 for the non convective zone and 0 28 for the heat storage zone bozkurt and karakilcik 2015 report efficiencies of between 0 12 and 0 28 depending on seasonal exposure conditions while kirk 1988 showed the dependence of capture efficiency on light absorption and scattering properties thus maximum attainable efficiencies for constructed sgsp s appear to be about 0 30 detailed analysis of heliothermal events 4 and 6 at lake hayward determined an achieved efficiency of 0 17 and 0 18 respectively the thermal stratification breaks down by downward mixing of the salinity interface and it is shown that mixolimnion evaporation is not sufficient to increase its tds concentration such that the density gradient between the mixolimnion and monimolimnion is significantly reduced table 2 the data also show that stratification can then be quickly re established for short periods when sufficient rainfall reforms the mixolimnion it is considered that the lake does not mix because of the steep density gradient and only becomes thermally homogeneous once the mixolimnion is mixed and disperses downwards assisted by mixing effects induced by wind energy a reconnaissance profile of water quality and temperature observations taken on 6 december 1991 in lake yalgorup located about 200 m north of lake hayward are shown in table 5 these data show that lake yalgorup also shows heliothermal behaviour with bottom temperatures reaching 38 7 c with the identification of lake yalgorup as a heliothermal lake this would indicate that four lakes lakes hayward yalgorup and north and south newnham clustered together in yalgorup national park qualify for inclusion in this unique lake typology their close proximity to each other suggests some interconnection and exchange via groundwater interaction is likely 6 conclusions natural heliothermal lakes are quite rare with only about 30 identified worldwide they occur in a variety of settings where there are significant changes to the lake s water balance especially ingress of low salinity surface water lake hayward has unique attributes with respect to its physical and meteorological settings the physical settings are shallow water depth of 2 5 m low groundwater gradient coastal location with high marine aerosol and rain derived salt input and an evolved hypersaline brine close to seawater ionic composition the meteorological settings are its rainfall event distribution wind regime and solar radiation exposure these attributes along with the optical physics of brines a stable if temporary density stratification and fluid dynamics combine in a unique configuration such that a form of geophysical resonance takes place resulting in the observation of a series of cyclical heliothermal events primarily dependent on the seasonal sequence of rainfall events two of the many heliothermal events were analysed in detail and the thermal efficiency of lake hayward with respect to solar energy capture integrated over the period of two closed and independent heliothermal events 4 and 6 was determined as 0 17 and 0 18 respectively these values are within the range of solar energy capture efficiencies predicted from theory and observed in several controlled sgsp trials the total heat gained in the two heliothermal events 4 and 6 at lake hayward were 10 2x106 and 4 6x106 mj or 34 2 and 15 4 mj m 3 respectively it has been observed that the water surface temperature the seasonality of rainfall steep density gradient protection from wind mixing and morphometry in combination are the most effective mechanism in establishing and maintaining an annual stratification cycle the timing of the rise and collapse of heliothermal conditions of about 10 20 days means that downward mixing due to wind and chemocline instability are the major causes of the disruption of stratification in lake hayward and that diffusion and evaporative concentration effects play only a minor role in de stratification the detailed thermal analysis of lake hayward and reconnaissance measurements at lakes yalgorup lakes newnham north and south and martins tank indicate that lake hayward is one of a cluster of four heliothermal lakes in the yalgorup national park this suggests a co ordinated and simultaneous study of all four lakes in this heliothermal group would provide further insights into

7358,lake hayward is one of only about 30 hypersaline lakes worldwide that is meromictic and heliothermal and as such behaves as a natural salt gradient solar pond lake hayward acts as a local groundwater sink resulting in seasonally variable hypersaline lake water with total dissolved solids tds in the upper layer mixolimnion ranging between 56 kg m 3 and 207 kg m 3 and the deeper layer monimolimnion from 153 kg m 3 to 211 kg m 3 this is up to six times the salinity of seawater and thus has the highest salinity of all eleven lakes in the yalgorup national park lake system a program of continuously recorded water temperature profiles has shown that salinity stratification initiated by direct rainfall onto the lake s surface and local runoff into the lake results in the onset of heliothermal conditions within hours of rainfall onset the lake alternates between being fully mixed and becoming thermally and chemically stratified several times during the annual cycle with the longest extended periods of heliothermal behaviour lasting 23 and 22 weeks in the winters of 1992 and 1993 respectively the objective was to quantify the heat budgets of the cyclical heliothermal behaviour of lake hayward during the period of temperature profile logging the maximum recorded temperature of the monimolimnion was 42 6 c at which time the temperature of the mixolimnion was 29 4 c the heat budget of two closed heliothermal cycles initiated by two rainfall events of 50 mm and 52 mm in 1993 were analysed the cycles prevailed for 11 and 20 days respectively and the heat budget showed net heat accumulations of 34 2 mj m 3 and 15 4 mj m 3 respectively the corresponding efficiencies of lake heat gain to incident solar energy were 0 17 and 0 18 respectively typically artificial salinity gradient solar ponds sgsp have a solar radiation capture efficiencies ranging from 0 10 up to 0 30 results from lake hayward have implications for comparative biogeochemistry and its characteristics should aid in identification of other hitherto unknown heliothermal lakes keywords hypersaline lakes heliothermal lakes natural salt gradient solar lakes solar ponds 1 introduction saline lakes are not uncommon features on all continents however natural meromictic lakes are less common hull et al 1989 and less than 200 have been documented walker and likens 1975 stewart et al 2010 lake hayward can be classified as a type ib meromictic lake according to the typology proposed by walker and likens 1975 however their classification does not include consideration of thermal heating characteristics meromictic lakes that are also heliothermal are even rarer and number less than 30 worldwide sonnenfeld and hudec 1980 hull et al 1989 chapter 2 the earliest reports of natural heliothermal lakes date back over a century to hungary kalecsinsky 1901 and lakes in romania schafarzik 1908 maxim 1929 where the salt is derived from near surface salt domes alexe et al 2017 have reviewed the limnology and plankton diversity in the romanian heliothermal lakes and zachara et al 2016 emphasise the unique biogeochemical attributes of a heliothermal lake in washington state sonnenfeld and hudec 1980 note that not all meromictic lakes are heliothermal and proposed a nomenclature of thermal stratification in heliothermal lakes which has been adopted in this paper thus the upper less dense layer is termed the mixolimnion and the deeper dense and hot layer the monimolimnion lake hayward is located in a group of eleven coastal interdunal lakes approximately 100 km south of perth western australia fig 1 all eleven lakes are located within the yalgorup national park in south west western australia where the regional climate is mediterranean with hot and dry summers and temperate wet winters rainfall data from 1982 to 1995 table 1 show annual totals of between 703 and 1075 mm annual class a pan evaporation rates have been shown to be greater than twice the annual rainfall ranging from 1557 to 1913 mm rosen et al 1996 several authors have studied the hydrochemistry limnology and sedimentology of lake hayward and a number of other lakes in the yalgorup lake system burne and moore 1987 burke and knott 1989 moore 1993 rosen and coshell 1992 coshell and rosen 1994 rosen et al 1995 1996 while forbes and vogwill 2016 have investigated the hydrological regime of the adjacent lake clifton in relation to its unique thrombolite reef the eleven lakes form three linear chains oriented in a north south direction parallel to the coast and at a minimum distance of 1 km lake preston and maximum distance of 4 km lake clifton from the indian ocean lake hayward is located about 3 km from the coastline and lies at the southern end of the central chain of eight lakes between the two largest and longest of the system namely lakes clifton and preston fig 2 the eleven lakes range in salinity from brackish to hypersaline with the hypersaline lake hayward consistently having the highest salinity of all eleven noble 2010 this is due to a combination of factors that include high marine aerosol deposition at its near coastal location driven by prevailing onshore winds its low lake bed elevation of about 2 5 m below sea level its low surface water elevation and a regionally flat groundwater hydraulic gradient that limits groundwater and thus solute flow and discharge to the ocean in combination these conditions result in the lake acting as a local groundwater sink and due to evaporative loss being hypersaline the brine density itself ranging between 1 04 and 1 09 also contributes to a reduction in the lake surface water elevation it is considered that marine derived salt has accumulated via aerosol deposition farrington et al 1993 in the yalgorup lake system as a result of the long term hundreds to thousands of years balance between the rates of marine aerosol deposition and the rate of advective discharge of salt return to the ocean by groundwater flow interestingly it is the interplay between these long term quasi stable physical hydrological and hydrogeochemical conditions and the very short term transient annual rainfall cycles that finds a resonance resulting in the heliothermal condition of lake hayward lake hayward is heliothermal for part of its annual hydrological cycle and displays characteristics similar to lago pueblo on el gran roque island in the caribbean hudec and sonnenfeld 1974 a solar pond located on the sinai peninsula por 1968 eckstein 1970 and the pretoria salt pan in south africa ashton and schoeman 1988 the heliothermal characteristics of most of these lakes appear during the wettest part of the year or at other times during the year when rainfall or other low total dissolved solids tds surface inputs are sufficient to reduce the density of the surface layer the disappearance of heliothermal conditions is due to progressive downward mixing of the mixolimnion with the monimolimnion and to some extent evaporation of the mixolimnion during summer while evaporation from the less saline mixolimnion contributes to the collapse of heliothermal conditions in the case of lake hayward the short cyclic occurrence of heliothermal conditions over periods of days must be due primarily to downward mixing and dispersal of the chemocline driven by wind perturbation evaporation is volumetrically insufficient to remove the lower salinity mixolimnion to an extent necessary to dissipate the chemocline in these respects lake hayward is in the terminology of artificially constructed solar ponds a natural salinity gradient solar pond sgsp sonnenfeld and hudec 1980 suggested that the minimum tds contrast between mixolimnion and monimolimnion should be 15 kgm 3 for heliothermal energy entrapment to occur a condition that is exceeded at lake hayward because of the salt concentration gradient lower layers are denser than upper layers even when warmer and full convection over the entire water column that would result in overnight heat loss to the atmosphere is prevented further saline water is opaque to infrared radiation and so heat loss to the atmosphere via back radiation from the monimolimnion is prevented heliothermal lakes develop a deeper heated layer of water due to absorption of solar radiation alone and because saline water is practically opaque in the infrared spectrum the density stratification sets up a condition where heat loss from the deeper heated layer can only occur at low rates by loss to groundwater and heat loss into the lake bed sediments as rainfall occurs onto an exposed dense brine or it is overrun by less dense waters from runoff stratification and the condition for heliothermal behaviour is established the balance between rates of incoming freshwater and its subsequent mixing with the deeper saline water or evaporation off the upper less saline layer water provide either transient or stable conditions sufficient to perpetuate the entrapment of incoming radiation a number of meromictic lakes and reservoirs have been described in australia many of them in tasmania tyler and bukney 1974 king and tyler 1981 victoria timms 1972 and queensland baly et al 1975 bunn and edward 1984 described three of the six permanent lakes on rottnest island western australia as meromictic hot lakes showing winter heating of the hypersaline monimolimnions from about 21 26 c with government house lake reaching the maximum temperature of 28 c groundwater temperatures not reported by bunn and edward 1984 on rottnest island range between 15 and 22 c average 18 1 c sd 1 4n 28 bryan et al 2016 thus the heating effect in the rottnest island lakes is small and could be ascribed to normal solar insolation and so cannot be classified as heliothermal as the monimolimnion heating is only a few degrees above the ambient groundwater temperature burke and knott 1989 noted that south newnham lake that is adjacent to lake hayward fig 1 stratified temporarily in 1987 reaching a temperature of 32 8 c one temperature profile from lake yalgorup whose southern shoreline is 250 m north of lake hayward fig 2 taken in december 1991 indicated bottom temperatures of 38 7 c lake hayward has been the most intensely studied of the three other adjacent hypersaline lakes and together with these reconnaissance measurements indicate that lake hayward is one of a cluster of four heliothermal lakes in the yalgorup national park that includes lakes yalgorup martins tank and newnham north and south considering newnham north and south merge into a single lake at high water level this paper presents a thermal analysis of the meromictic heliothermal behaviour of lake hayward showing the energy budget and solar energy capture efficiencies of two closed heliothermal events in 1993 selected from amongst numerous heliothermal responses during the year the purpose of the paper is to document for the first time detailed observations of the thermal behaviour of a hypersaline heliothermal lake in australia and to present the first detailed thermal balance of any a heliothermal lake the analysis accounts for the observed cyclic heliothermal behaviour in terms of the lake s hydrologic setting salinity regime physical geographic setting and solar energy capture the paper is the first to provide a detailed heat budget and thermal energy transfers of a natural heliothermal lake and explains how periodic short term stratification events causes heliothermal behaviour in a natural hypersaline lake an analysis of thermal efficiency of lake hayward is presented and is found to be within the range of efficiencies of sgsps 2 physical and hydrological setting field methods and data collection 2 1 physical and hydrological setting the yalgorup national park is underlain by an unconfined hypersaline aquifer which is reported to be 20 m thick and covered by a lens of fresh groundwater commander 1988 the satellite image fig 2 of lake hayward shows its physical proximity to lake yalgorup to the north lake preston to the west lake clifton to the east and lake newnham north to the south locations of the temperature thermistor profile and five multilevel piezometer nests are also shown four figures showing the geometry and bathymetric map of lake hayward the corresponding surface area and volume relationships with lake level elevation and actual lake surface area and volumes for 1991 through 1993 are given in the supplementary material to this paper the actual lake area and volumes plots both show spike responses to rainfall events including responses used in detailed analysis of heliothermal events 4 and 6 lake hayward is located in an interdunal depression between lake clifton to its east and lake preston to its west and with the local hydrological boundary at sea level 4 km to the west and its lower elevation in the landscape acts as a groundwater sink at its maximum standing water level lake hayward is 1 3 km long and has a width of 0 5 km the maximum depth is 2 5 m and the maximum surface area is 0 6 km2 during annual seasonal hydrologic cycles from 1991 to 1993 lake hayward s water level fluctuated by approximately 1 m fig 3 and supplementary material throughout the period its water level was consistently 0 3 m below that of lake clifton and below the peel harvey estuary by about 0 3 0 4 m during the summer months and between 0 3 and 0 4 m above it in winter at its greatest depth the bed of lake hayward is approximately 2 5 m below sea level 2 5 m australian height datum ahd and the maximum lake water level decline is to about 0 5 m ahd the seasonal trend in water level in the peel harvey estuary is shown because it is a proxy for sea level that imposes a sea level boundary condition to groundwater at the north eastern side of yalgorup national park this contributes to very flat regional groundwater gradients that in turn diminishes the return of accumulated marine aerosol salt in the lake system via groundwater flow to the ocean noble 2010 confirmed that lake hayward attains the lowest water level of all 11 lakes in the yalgorup lake system and is also the most saline of them all in winter lake hayward lake water levels increase as the lake is fed by direct rainfall local runoff from its beach margins and groundwater inflow fig 2 groundwater enters the lake mainly via seepages along the eastern margin of the lake although peaked or tepee structures found in beach sediments on the western margin of the lake indicate that groundwater could enter the lake from the west as well coshell and rosen 1994 rapid post rainfall rises in lake water level of a few centimetres recede rapidly at a rate higher than can be accounted for by evaporation alone and therefore a majority of the lake level recession following rainfall is due to discharge to groundwater water balance analysis using a simultaneous water solute and isotope mass balance model barr et al 2000 was carried out for the first three months of 1993 i e in the lead up to events 4 and 6 when the lake volume was receding the analysis showed that the rate of recession could be accounted for by lake water discharge via groundwater outflow and evaporation and that this was occurring volumetrically in the ratio of 3 1 evapotranspiration by surrounding vegetation results in groundwater level decline in summer and a corresponding recession of the lake level thus the lake water body exchanges with groundwater at different rates and directions under seasonal conditions a characteristic shown by other shallow lakes and wetlands on the swan coastal plain of western australia townley et al 1993 and turner and townley 2006 2 2 field methods and data collection water level data in lakes hayward and clifton was collected at 30 min intervals using capacitance water level sensors dataflow model 392 dataflow systems pty ltd noosaville qld australia water level data in the peel harvey estuary was obtained from the west australian department of marine and harbours records the bathymetry of lake hayward was obtained by manual depth probing for water depth and differential gps for location water sample profiles were collected from above and below the chemocline at the same location as the temperature recordings fig 2 one litre water samples were collected in hdpe bottles and electrode sensor measurements including ph temperature electrical conductivity and dissolved oxygen were made using a polycarbonate flow through cell that allowed stable measurement of the respective field parameter without contact between water and the atmosphere water samples were pumped to the surface using 12 v centrifugal pumps detailed climate data collection net radiation air temperature rainfall relative humidity and wind run collected at 15 min intervals commencing in early 1993 and was obtained from a purpose deployed automatic climate station environdata queensland australia located on the eastern shore of the adjacent lake clifton location shown in fig 1 daily rainfall was also measured at the yalgorup national park ranger s station fig 1 temperature profiles from lake hayward were recorded using a profile of thermistor temperature sensors and data loggers wesdata data recorder model 888 every 30 min prior to deployment the thermistors were calibrated accuracy 0 1 c in a temperature controlled water bath using a mercury thermometer over a temperature range of 15 50 c a vertical profile of eight temperature sensors thermistors 1 8 was installed over a depth of 1 6 m at 20 cm intervals thermistor positions spanned a range of depths above and below the thermocline and were located at fixed positions relative to the lake bed sediments the deepest thermistor thermistor 8 was positioned 10 cm above the lake bed sediments events 4 and 6 occurred when the lake was close to its lowest seasonal level after summer and thermistor 1 was 55 and 51 cm respectively below the lake surface at low stages of lake level elevation such as for events 4 and 6 the thermistor depth range covered 80 of the total water depth groundwater temperature data in the vicinity of lake hayward was collected manually from sixteen shallow nested piezometers adjacent to the lake on the central eastern and western margins fig 2 the average groundwater temperature was 18 7 c n 47 sd 1 6 data presented in four figures in the supplementary material to this paper were the physical elements of the data necessary to calculate evaporation from the lake via meteorological and energy budget methods for events 4 and 6 3 meteorological and thermal balance evaporation estimation the principle adopted to validate the thermal analysis for the two closed heliothermal events events 4 and 6 was to calculate evaporation from lake hayward via two independent methods firstly the penman monteith combination method was used based on meteorological data from the climate station at lake clifton secondly evaporation was estimated from the energy budget of lake hayward agreement between evaporation estimated via the independent penman monteith combination and energy budget methods would justify the use of thermal analysis to estimate energy terms of the two heliothermal events and the estimation of the efficiency of solar energy conversion to heat 3 1 penman monteith combination method the penman monteith combination model is widely used to estimate evaporation from water finch and calver 2008 and has recently been shown to produce reliable estimates of evaporation when local physical site and wind function data are available mcjannet et al 2013 the penman monteith equation combines energy budget and mass transfer terms and the following equation mcjannet et al 2013 was used to estimate evaporation epm from the open water surface of lake hayward in mm per day 1 e pm 1 λ δ r nl n ρ c p e sat e a r a δ γ where λ is the latent heat of vapourisation mj kg 1 δ is the slope of the saturation vapour pressure curve at the air temperature kpa c 1 rnl is the net radiation for the lake mj m 2 d 1 n is the change in heat storage in the water body mj m 2 d 1 ρ is the density of air kg m 3 cp is the specific heat of air mj kg 1 c 1 esat and ea are the saturated vapour pressure of the air kpa at the water surface temperature and the vapour pressure of the air kpa at a reference height in this case 2 m respectively ra is the aerodynamic resistance sm 1 and ϒ is the psychometric constant kpa c 1 both short wave rs and net radiation rn were measured over the land surface at the lake clifton climate station because the net radiation was measured over the land surface and not over the water surface of lake hayward the net radiation r nl wm 2 for lake hayward was determined from the measured short wave radiation rs at the lake clifton climate station using the following equation brutsaert 1982 2 r nl r s 1 α s ε s r ld r lu where rs is the measured short wave radiation w m 2 αs is the albedo of the lake surface an assumed value of 0 06 was used brutsaert 1982 εs is the emissivity of the lake water taken as 0 97 rld is the downward longwave radiation rlu the upward long wave radiation rld and rlu were substituted by 3 r ld ε ac σ t a 4 and 4 r lu ε s σ t s 4 where εac is the atmospheric emissivity given by εac 0 124 ea ta 1 7 where ea is as above kpa ta is the air temperature k σ is the stefan boltzmann constant and ts is the lake surface temperature k the net radiation r nl w m 2 from eq 2 was converted to rnl mj m 2 d 1 in eq 1 by the conversion factor 0 0864 the aerodynamic resistance term ra was calculated using the following equation calder and neal 1984 mcjannet et al 2013 5 r a ρ c p γ f u where f u mj m 2 d 1 kpa 1 is the wind function at 2 m height above ground level which for lake hayward was taken from the general wind function expression of mcjannet et al 2012 with relevant meteorological measurements made over land at the lake clifton climate station and applied to lake evaporation 6 f u 5 78 4 09 u 2 a 0 05 where u2 is the wind speed at 2 m elevation above ground level and a is the area of the lake m2 the availability of continuous meteorological data from the lake clifton climate station allowed evaporation from lake hayward to be calculated at 15 min intervals during heliothermal events 4 and 6 for a hypersaline lake the free water evaporation rate is reduced due to the high ionic concentrations that lower the saturated vapour pressure of the water calculation of evaporation from water bodies with high solute concentrations was based on the method of salhotra et al 1985 in which evaporation from a water body is reduced at high salinities the evaporation reduction factor α due to the elevated salt concentration is given by 7 α β c l e sat ψ e a e sat ψ e a where β cl is the activity coefficient of the saline lake water unitless ψ is the relative humidity and esat and ea are as above the evaporation reduction factor represents the ratio of vapour pressure over salt water to vapour pressure over fresh water at the same temperature thus the expression used for correcting the penman monteith evaporation from lake hayward due to salinity is epmsc αepm and for events 4 and 6 α ranged between 0 79 and 0 92 3 2 lake energy budget the thermal balance or heat budget method is described by anderson 1954 a b harbeck et al 1958 harbeck et al 1959 hughes 1967 sturrock et al 1992 these describe extensive studies on reservoirs and lakes in the united states in australia thermal balance studies have also been completed on a number of large lakes and reservoirs including mundaring wier near perth hoy and stevens 1979 and on perry lakes a small shallow non saline wetland in metropolitan perth rich 2004 the calculation scheme applied to lake hayward was adapted from those of anderson 1954 a b harbeck et al 1958 harbeck et al 1959 hughes 1967 and sturrock et al 1992 as adapted by rich 2004 a thermal balance relates net energy transfer into and out of a water body to changes in stored energy such that the sensible and latent heat lost from the lake surface net incoming radiation net heat transport through other surfaces change in stored heat at lake hayward this was expanded following rich 2004 taking the form 8 e q s q sr q a q ar q bs q rn q dc q rc q se q x ρ l 1 r c t e t b where qs is incoming short wave radiation qsr is reflected short wave radiation qa is incoming long wave radiation qar is reflected long wave radiation and qbs is long wave radiation emitted from the water these 5 terms constitute net radiation to the lake and the value used was rnl mj m 2 d 1 as above qrn is the heat in rainwater falling directly on the lake qdc is the heat in groundwater discharged to the lake qrc is the heat in lake water recharged to the aquifer qse is the heat conducted into and out of the lake sediments qx is the change in heat energy stored in the lake ρ is the density of evaporated water at surface water temperature to kg m 3 l is the latent heat of evaporation of water mj kg 1 r is the bowen ratio dimensionless sensible heat flux qh latent heat flux qe c is the specific heat of water at surface water temperature to mj kg 1 te is the temperature of the evaporated water taken as equal

directly where qe is the energy used for evaporation ρel qh is the energy conducted from the water as sensible heat rqe qw is the energy advected from the water body via evaporated water ρce te tb the bracketed groups of heat budget terms in the numerator of eq 8 terms are expressed in watts per m2 w m 2 for computational purposes however all q terms in the numerator of eq 8 were expressed as mj m 2 d 1 and the denominator in mj m 3 d 1 yielding evaporation eeb in metres the groundwater term qrc for event 4 was estimated from the lake level recession hydrograph see supplementary material where the lake level response to event 4 rainfall was a 12 cm rise the spike in lake level rapidly receded during the following days at a rate of 6 3 104 m3 d 1 equivalent to 6 3 mm d 1 which significantly exceeded evaporation the volume and corresponding heat content loss from the lake were therefore assigned in the heat budget to the qrc term as lake water recharged to the aquifer at the corresponding heat content of the monimolimnion groundwater inflow qdc was considered to be zero during events 4 and 6 detailed lake water level logger data was not available for event 6 and was reconstructed from available manual measurements given that the initiating rainfall of event 6 was about 70 that of event 4 the qrc volume was scaled accordingly for event 6 the lake bed sediment heat loss term qse is generally regarded as small robertson and barry 1985 and was neglected for the short duration of events 4 and 6 4 results 4 1 hydrogeochemistry fig 4 a and b show the variation in density and tds data respectively collected from the stratified and fully mixed lake from 1991 to the beginning of 1994 including the periods of detailed analysis in 1992 and 1993 the water chemistry of lake hayward is a na mg cl so4 brine similar in ionic composition to seawater reflecting the origin of the salt as marine aerosol deposition rosen et al 1996 the concentration of the conservative ions varies seasonally due to concentration by evaporation over summer and dilution over winter due to rainfall and surface run off from the lake s beach margin fig 2 in march 1991 the tds of the mixolimnion was 206 9 kgm 3 in its mixed state and declined to 55 9 kgm 3 during a period of stratification until october 1991 over the same time the monimolimnion tds was measured at 206 9 kgm 3 when mixed in march 1991 and declined to 194 5 kgm 3 during stratification in october 1991 table 2 fig 4a and b events 4 and 6 can be seen to occur when the lake was close to its peak density and tds in 1993 lake hayward unlike many meromictic lakes is oxygenated in both the mixolimnion and monimolimnion the mixolimnion is generally well oxygenated average 6 7 mgl 1 dissolved oxygen whilst the monimolimnion is generally supersaturated average 11 1 mgl 1 dissolved oxygen table 2 and table 3 this is due to photosynthesis in the benthic microbial communities bmc burke and knott 1989 rosen et al 1995 during the period 1991 1994 the total dissolved solids tds of the mixolimnion ranged from 56 kg m 3 up to 207 kg m 3 and the monimolimnion from 153 kgm 3 to 211 kgm 3 maximum contrasts in tds for the years 1991 1993 were 140 80 and 50 kgm 3 respectively maximum density contrasts were 0 065 0 04 and 0 02 respectively with a maximum density of 1 095 observed in the monimolimnion in 1991 these density and tds contrasts exceed the minimum tds difference of 15 kg m 3 suggested by sonnenfeld and hudec 1980 as the minimum contrast necessary for heliothermal energy capture 4 2 climate data table 1 shows a summary of annual bureau of meteorology climate data temperature rainfall and class a pan evaporation from mandurah 40 km north of lake hayward from 1982 to 1995 showing the annual pan evaporation excess over rainfall during 1993 climate data were collected from the dedicated climate station located on the eastern shoreline of lake clifton fig 1 although meteorological data was recorded for the duration of 1993 for brevity and relevance the data shown in fig 5 a and b are for the time period of the two closed heliothermal events analysed in detail event 4 and event 6 in march and may june 1993 respectively the meteorological data were used to calculate evaporation rates from lake hayward at 15 min intervals during events 4 and 6 using equations 1 and 2 the meteorologically based evaporation estimates were corrected for the effect of high salt concentrations in the lake water and then compared to the independently derived evaporation estimates from the heat budget calculations the top panels in fig 5a and b show the calculated salt corrected evaporation rate e pmsc during events 4 and 6 respectively figs 6 and 7 show recorded temperatures in lake hayward at up to eight thermistor depths at 30 min intervals from early 1992 fig 6 to late 1993 fig 7 the data gap from january to march 1993 was due to a requirement for equipment maintenance where thermistor data traces are not shown it was due to a technical failure of that thermistor to record data daily rainfall data shown in figs 6 and 7 was collected at yalgorup national park ranger s station near lake hayward fig 1 these data are considered representative rainfall falling directly onto the lake surface and the non vegetated beach fig 2 the temperature data show the number of time periods when the lake was alternately thermally stratified or fully mixed during periods of mixing the temperature data converge towards a single lake temperature during periods of lake stratification distinct temperature traces developed depending on the depth of the recording thermistor 4 3 overall thermal conditions in early 1992 the thermal behaviour of lake hayward was characterised by residual stratification from 1991 that was re activated by 30 mm of rainfall in february this is illustrated in fig 6 event 1 and fig 8 a the latter figure showing the temperature difference between the mixolimnion and monimolimnion and its relation to cumulative rainfall during 1992 thermal stratification was progressively collapsing in early 1992 and by early march the lake had attained a fully mixed condition a short period of stratification occurred in early may in response to 40 mm of rainfall fig 6 event 2 this stratification lasted for less than the month of may and had ceased by mid may 1992 this thermal behaviour is similar to the two closed heliothermal events in 1993 event 4 and event 6 that are analysed in detail later rainfall in late may event 2a then initiated the major period of stratification and heating of the monimolimnion for 1992 that persisted for approximately 6 months through winter and into early summer 1992 event 3 has been differentiated into eleven sub events events 3a 3 k when the input of fresh water due to rainfall and local beach runoff exceeded net evaporation lake hayward became thermally and chemically stratified for the rest of its annual cycle due to downward mixing and dispersal of the chemocline driven by wind perturbation and evaporation particularly during summer lake hayward became thermally homogeneous the results show two periods in 1992 when the lake became temporarily stratified due to rainfall events 2 and 3 clearly showing that heliothermal behaviour is initiated by rainfall events lake hayward starts to become thermally stratified within hours of rainfall occurring with the monimolimnion warming by as much as 5 c within several days e g event 2 the amount of rainfall required to trigger these events varies and is dependent upon the pre event ambient temperature of the lake at lower temperatures it appears that smaller amounts of rain are required to trigger thermal stratification 20 march 1993 46 5 mm rainfall lake temperature 22 c 18 may 1993 26 3 mm rainfall lake temperature 18 5 c fig 7 the onset of heliothermal behaviour actually commences with a cooling of the mixolimnion for example in event 2 the mixolimnion cooled by about 2 5 c due to the incident cooler rainwater and beach runoff however this was followed within a few hours by warming of the monimolimnion this behaviour is also seen in events 4 and 6 in 1993 collapse of heliothermal conditions occurs gradually for example just prior to event 3i fig 6 thermistor 5 then at a depth of 1 5 m below the water surface showed a cooling of about 13 c from 33 c to 20 c over three days between 31 october 1992 and 2 november 1992 showing that the mixolimnion was descending through and past the level of thermistor 5 six weeks later in mid december event 3 k the mixolimnion had descended a further 20 cm to and beyond thermistor 6 in 1992 the two deepest thermistors 7 and 8 did not return data at that time although it is likely that the mixolimnion would have descended further in november 1993 similar behaviour re occurred at event 7 g fig 7 where first the shallower thermistor 7 depth to the water surface of 2 13 m and then thermistor 8 depth to the water surface of 2 33 m are seen to converge sequentially over about 2 weeks to the mixolimnion temperature fig 8a and b show the differences between the monimolimnion and mixolimnion temperatures versus cumulative rainfall for 1992 and 1993 respectively comparison of fig 8a and b show the effect of cumulative rainfall in 1992 of 800 mm resulted in maximum temperature differences of between 10 8 c and 17 8 c during september and october in 1993 which had a lower cumulative rainfall of just under 600 mm the maximum temperature differences ranged between 6 0 c and 12 8 c this difference indicates the importance of both annual rainfall amount and its timing on the heliothermal effect and heat accumulation at lake hayward in addition to the extended heliothermal event that commenced in june 1993 event 7 there were four instances recorded earlier in the year the first event fig 7 event 4 occurred in mid march several days of low surface water temperature preceded a rainfall event on 19 march with a recorded total rainfall of 46 5 mm event 4 which resulted in the lake becoming stratified for a period of 10 days finer detail of the thermal behaviour during event 4 are shown in fig 9 a the second occurrence event 5 1 may 1993 initiated a barely perceptible heliothermal response of less than 1 c a third event fig 7 event 6 occurred in mid may when recorded rainfall of 26 3 mm plus two further days of 3 5 and 2 mm rainfall resulted in lake hayward becoming stratified for a period of 10 days strong winds for a period of 36 h from 19 to 20 may did not result in the lake becoming mixed the fourth sub event fig 7 event 6a began on 29 may and lasted for 9 days rainfall over this period consisted of two days of 13 and 15 mm in addition to strong winds a further day with 6 5 mm of rainfall prolonged the stratification until 8 june finer detail of the thermal behaviour during event 6 are shown in fig 9b rainfall on 12 june 10 mm initiated event 7 during which there were numerous sub event events 7a 7 g which overall constituted a period of five months of continuous stratification between events 7d and 7 g the mixolimnion heated up and converged thermally with the monimolimnion at 7 g when the lake became fully mixed in late november 1993 full mixing was preceded by a month of gradual cooling of the monimolimnion fig 7 three days of rainfall on 9 10 and 12 november event 7f also resulted in a minor stratification of the lake 4 4 thermal balance and heat capture for events 4 and 6 fig 9a shows the detailed thermal behaviour of event 4 in response to the 46 5 mm rainfall event on 19 march 1993 the initial response is a 1 2 c cooling at all five recording thermistors as a result of the cool incident rainfall and runoff at the lower air temperature at the time which ranged from 7 to 10 c fig 7a the cooling effect of the initial rainfall and runoff occurs progressively with depth and reached thermistor 2 at 75 cm below the lake surface about 24 h after the onset of rainfall following the rainfall temperatures recorded by thermistors at all five depths rise with the deepest three thermistors 4 7 and 8 rising six degrees from about 22 c to 28 c in the 57 days between event 4 and event 6 the fully mixed lake cooled by about 7 c fig 9 shows the detailed thermal behaviour of event 6 showing a temperature rise from 17 c to 23 c in response to the initial rainfall of 31 mm on 18 5 1993 temperatures converged to about 18 c for about 1 day on 28th may but an additional 25 mm of rain event 6a resulted in re establishment of heliothermal conditions for a further five days for the thermal analysis of event 6 the ten day period from 18 to 28 may is considered the temperature data in fig 9a and b were used to calculate the heat content in megajoules mj for each of the monimolimnion and mixolimnion layers from the temperature responses of the thermistors the mixolimnion of events 4 and 6 was estimated by interpolation to have a thickness of 0 85 m the known lake level mixolimnion and monimolimnion thicknesses and the lake bathymetry allowed volume estimates and hence heat contents of the layers to be calculated see figures in supplementary material the change in heat energy stored in the lake mj m 2 d 1 n in eq 1 and qx in eq 8 was calculated at 15 min intervals from the change in water temperature δt using qx ρ cp δt where ρ is the density of the lake water cp is the heat capacity j kg 1 k 1 and t is the temperature c lake water heat capacities were adjusted for their salt content after sharqawy et al 2010 4 5 evaporation estimates for events 4 and 6 evaporation estimates calculated at 15 min intervals from the salinity corrected penman monteith equation epmsc eqs 1 and 7 and from the heat budget eeb eq 8 for events 4 and 6 summed into daily evaporation totals are shown in fig 10 for event 4 the total epmsc 88 mm and eeb 83 mm and for event 6 epmsc 16 mm and eeb 40 mm event 4 shows excellent agreement between daily summed epmsc and eeb evaporation the agreement is poorer for event 6 noting that the magnitude of evaporation has decreased by a factor of two between events 4 and 6 the most likely cause of the difference between epmsc and eeb in event 6 is poorer synchronisation of evaporation estimates of epmsc and eeb at 15 min intervals as the overall evaporation rate declines due to decreasing net radiation r nl and the term r nl n in eq 1 becomes dominated by n resulting in negative evaporation as seen in fig 10 however the overall consistency between epmsc and eeb is considered acceptable to justify using the method to calculate the efficiency of solar energy capture by the lake 4 6 efficiency of heliothermal heat capture the efficiency of heliothermal heat capture of the two events 4 and 6 was considered by recognising that prior to the heliothermal events the lake was fully mixed and was gaining and losing heat diurnally by normal solar insolation and as such is regarded as the initial baseline thermal condition figs 9a and 11 and 9b and fig 12 for events 4 and 6 respectively during the two heliothermal events when thermal stratification occurred diurnal heat capture and loss of both the monimolimnion and mixolimnion was estimated the cessation of the two events was evidenced by the lake returning to fully mixed conditions as heliothermal heat capture ceased and so a new post event baseline thermal condition of the lake was attained thus the net effect of the heliothermal events could be determined as closed events because the heliothermal events ceased when the lake returned to a new post event fully mixed thermal condition tables 4a and 4b summarise the daily heat budgets of lake hayward during the pre event baseline and heliothermal stages table 4a shows three aspects of the thermal balance of event 4 taken from figs 9a and 11 the pre event heat gains and losses as a baseline comparison heat gain and loss during the net heat gaining stage and the total heat balance fig 9a and b show the relative cumulative heat contents of the mixolimnion and monimolimnion calculated at 15 min intervals for events 4 and 6 respectively along with rainfall amount the cumulative heat content traces commence at a nominal null position on 11 march 1993 for event 4 and at 11 may 1993 for event 6 when on each occasion the lake was fully mixed the seven diurnal temperature cycles between 11 and 19 march 1993 leading up to event 4 are taken as the baseline condition prior to event 4 during this period fig 11 and table 4a show that the lake was gaining on average 3 6 mj m 3 day 1 and losing 6 4 mj m 3 day 1 depending on the particular daily weather condition i e a net loss of about 18 mjm 3 or about 2 8 mj m 3day 1 this corresponds to a total daily heat gain of 13 7 of the input radiation and loss of 38 1 thus the lake is seen to cool figs 7 9a and 11 by heat loss to the atmosphere following event 4 rainfall on 19 march 1993 the lake became thermally stratified almost immediately and the heat contents of the mixolimnion and monimolimnion diverged by 8 mj m 3 during the next 5 days the heat content of the monimolimnion increased almost monotonically by 22 mj m 3 although a daily surge in heat capture is still discernible in the trace although the mixolimnion has a lower heat content it too gains heat which was transferred from the monimolimnion by interface dispersion and mixing the important difference is that the mixolimnion can be seen to loose heat acquired from the monimolimnion at night of between 5 and 10 mj m 3 while the monimolimnion ceases heat gain at night but holds heat gained during the day due to salinity stratification and the opacity of the mixolimnion to infrared radiation on 25 and 26 march 1993 interface dispersion and mixing transferred heat from the monimolimnion and at times heat contents of both monimolimnion and mixolimnion were almost equal from 27 to 29 march 1993 daily heat gain occurred again in the monimolimnion with large excursions in the mixolimnion heat content of 10 15 mj m 3 as heat transferred from the monimolimnion continued via interface dispersion and mixing finally on 30 march 1993 the lake once again became fully mixed and remained so over the date range shown in fig 11 minor heat content excursions can be seen to have occurred in response to smaller rainfall events subsequent to 30 march 1993 in terms of the total event 4 heat budget it is assumed that in the absence of event 4 the lake would have continued to cool during the period 12 march 1993 to 23 march 1993 losing about 2 5 mj m 3 d 1 thus heat captured during heliothermal conditions not only adds to the heat budget but also compensates for heat that otherwise would have been lost to the atmosphere adding a compensation for this to the net heat gain during event 4 i e heat content at the end of event 4 minus that at its beginning the lake made a total heat gain of 10 2 x 106 mj giving a total lake heat gain corresponding to 16 7 of the incoming shortwave radiation the total lake heat gain during event 4 was 34 2 mj m 3 and the net heat gain was 3 1 mj m 3 d 1 the data in table 4a show that during heliothermal conditions the lake actually absorbs no more solar radiation energy than it does during fully mixed i e pre event 4 conditions 3 0 mj m 3 compared to 2 0 mj m 3 but importantly the energy absorbed by the monimolimnion cannot escape to the atmosphere diurnally but accumulates and exchanges slowly to the mixolimnion from which it escapes to the atmosphere the heat differential between monimolimnion and mixolimnion collapses via downward mixing and dispersion of the chemocline and lake hayward again became fully mixed table 4b shows the corresponding data for event 6 because event 6 occurred two months after event 4 and was further into winter the daily solar insolation had declined by at least 20 but due to cloud conditions daily incident solar insolation was about 40 lower than that during event 4 during the six days prior to the onset of event 6 when the lake was fully mixed 12 17 may 1993 there was an average daily heat gain of about 3 7 mj m 3 and an average overnight loss of about 3 4 mj m 3 giving a baseline net daily heat gain of 0 3 mj m 3 thus there was little change in heat content but the daily heat gain of 3 7 mj m 3 was similar to that in event 4 the initiating rainfall event of 18 may 1993 lead to both the monimolimnion and mixolimnion gaining heat at an average rate of 7 3 and 4 1 mj m 3 d 1 respectively but overnight the mixolimnion lost 6 9 mj m 3 d 1 to the atmosphere giving a net heat gain of 1 6 mj m 3 d 1 i e about half that of event 4 and above the pre event 6 baseline heat captured during heliothermal conditions during event 6 does not compensate for ambient heat loss as the pre event 6 fully mixed heat loss was close to zero 0 3 mj m 3 d 1 the total net heat gain to the lake during event 6 was 4 6 106 mj or 15 4 mj m 3 corresponding to a total lake heat gain equal to 18 1 of the incoming solar radiation 5 discussion from studies of lake hayward burke and knott 1989 it was known that the lake became thermally stratified at least once per year but not always at the same time of year or for the same length of time during the summer of 1986 1987 the lake was mixed for a period of 4 months burke and knott 1989 in 1991 1992 lake hayward was mixed for a period of only six weeks there had been relatively high rainfall during the winter of 1991 1075 mm and a relatively cool summer resulting in reduced evaporation rosen et al 1996 for the years 1991 to 1994 when lake temperature data were recorded a positive linear correlation was found between maximum monimolimnion temperature and annual rainfall table 1 which can be expressed as max temp c rainfall mm 0 218 20 5 the correlation is indicative and year to year will be dependent on the timing and magnitude of rainfall distribution within the year at the annual and rainfall event time scale the study has established a clear relationship between rainfall input and the onset and magnitude of transient heliothermal conditions in the absence of surface water inputs as direct rainfall and runoff from the lake s beach the lake can quickly return to a thermally homogenous state and a diurnal pattern of heating and cooling groundwater inflow rainfall and beach runoff on to the lake surface are the only inputs to lake hayward the prevailing winds and rain that originate from over the indian ocean to the west and the rainwater and aerosols carry marine derived ions in the vicinity of lake hayward groundwater inflow is from the northeast but is complicated by density driven reverse flow from lake hayward toward lake clifton evidence for such exchange is given by the fact that groundwater with a total dissolved solids tds of 7 kg m 3 was measured at the base screen depth 20 m depth of the aquifer close to the lake in piezometer 15 rosen et al 1996 mid way between lake hayward and lake clifton fig 2 groundwater with this salinity can only be derived from lake hayward as lake clifton never attains such a high salinity in its annual cycle whereas lake hayward does fig 6a and furthermore exceeds it so that with dilution from local rainfall recharge to groundwater the salinity observed in piezometer 15 can be obtained it is also shown supplementary material from the hydrographic recession of lake level following rainfall events that lake water is released into groundwater thus groundwater exchange with the lake certainly occurs and it is evident that hypersaline lake water released into the aquifer could be returned to the lake later lake hayward becomes stratified because of direct rainfall to the free surface of the lake the effect of the fresh water is to decrease the density and tds of the mixolimnion steepening the density gradient between the mixolimnion and monimolimnion the small surface area of lake hayward results in minimal wind driven mixing and causes a steep salinity gradient from top to bottom results in the formation of stable but temporary stratification downward mixing and dispersion of the mixolimnion is able to dissipate the stratification within a period of days to weeks unless follow up rainfall occurs that re initiates heliothermal conditions unlike other lakes in the yalgorup national park lake hayward is relatively well protected from the effects of the wind induced mixing by medium sized eucalyptus trees located around the lake margins storms with accompanying strong winds are common along the coast during winter and yet stratification is most persistent over the wet winter period the water clarity of lake hayward is generally very high with visibility to the lake bottom when not obscured by the benthic microbial communities which periodically lift off the lake bed and float up to the chemocline solar energy is absorbed at the deeper levels of the lake and can only escape by conductive heat transfer hull et al 1989 the thermal efficiency of sgsps has been defined as the ratio of total thermal energy extracted to the total solar radiation that falls on the pond s surface over a specified interval sgsps are capable of achieving temperatures of 80 103 c dorn 1980 due to the optimised nature of their construction surface area depth and the salinity contrast and thickness of the mixolimnion and monimolimnion several authors have defined the efficiency of the solar pond from the point of view of the thermal energy stored in the system relative to the incident radiation kooi 1979 analysed the steady state salt gradient solar pond and showed theoretically that the maximum efficiency of salt gradient ponds with depths of 1 to 2 m is in the range 0 35 0 40 nie et al 2011 used thermal data from an artificial the solar pond in tibet to deduce its thermal efficiency ranged from 0 07 to 0 31 depending on seasonal conditions karakilcik et al 2006 report the highest thermal efficiencies were obtained in august as 0 05 for the upper convective zone 0 14 for the non convective zone and 0 28 for the heat storage zone bozkurt and karakilcik 2015 report efficiencies of between 0 12 and 0 28 depending on seasonal exposure conditions while kirk 1988 showed the dependence of capture efficiency on light absorption and scattering properties thus maximum attainable efficiencies for constructed sgsp s appear to be about 0 30 detailed analysis of heliothermal events 4 and 6 at lake hayward determined an achieved efficiency of 0 17 and 0 18 respectively the thermal stratification breaks down by downward mixing of the salinity interface and it is shown that mixolimnion evaporation is not sufficient to increase its tds concentration such that the density gradient between the mixolimnion and monimolimnion is significantly reduced table 2 the data also show that stratification can then be quickly re established for short periods when sufficient rainfall reforms the mixolimnion it is considered that the lake does not mix because of the steep density gradient and only becomes thermally homogeneous once the mixolimnion is mixed and disperses downwards assisted by mixing effects induced by wind energy a reconnaissance profile of water quality and temperature observations taken on 6 december 1991 in lake yalgorup located about 200 m north of lake hayward are shown in table 5 these data show that lake yalgorup also shows heliothermal behaviour with bottom temperatures reaching 38 7 c with the identification of lake yalgorup as a heliothermal lake this would indicate that four lakes lakes hayward yalgorup and north and south newnham clustered together in yalgorup national park qualify for inclusion in this unique lake typology their close proximity to each other suggests some interconnection and exchange via groundwater interaction is likely 6 conclusions natural heliothermal lakes are quite rare with only about 30 identified worldwide they occur in a variety of settings where there are significant changes to the lake s water balance especially ingress of low salinity surface water lake hayward has unique attributes with respect to its physical and meteorological settings the physical settings are shallow water depth of 2 5 m low groundwater gradient coastal location with high marine aerosol and rain derived salt input and an evolved hypersaline brine close to seawater ionic composition the meteorological settings are its rainfall event distribution wind regime and solar radiation exposure these attributes along with the optical physics of brines a stable if temporary density stratification and fluid dynamics combine in a unique configuration such that a form of geophysical resonance takes place resulting in the observation of a series of cyclical heliothermal events primarily dependent on the seasonal sequence of rainfall events two of the many heliothermal events were analysed in detail and the thermal efficiency of lake hayward with respect to solar energy capture integrated over the period of two closed and independent heliothermal events 4 and 6 was determined as 0 17 and 0 18 respectively these values are within the range of solar energy capture efficiencies predicted from theory and observed in several controlled sgsp trials the total heat gained in the two heliothermal events 4 and 6 at lake hayward were 10 2x106 and 4 6x106 mj or 34 2 and 15 4 mj m 3 respectively it has been observed that the water surface temperature the seasonality of rainfall steep density gradient protection from wind mixing and morphometry in combination are the most effective mechanism in establishing and maintaining an annual stratification cycle the timing of the rise and collapse of heliothermal conditions of about 10 20 days means that downward mixing due to wind and chemocline instability are the major causes of the disruption of stratification in lake hayward and that diffusion and evaporative concentration effects play only a minor role in de stratification the detailed thermal analysis of lake hayward and reconnaissance measurements at lakes yalgorup lakes newnham north and south and martins tank indicate that lake hayward is one of a cluster of four heliothermal lakes in the yalgorup national park this suggests a co ordinated and simultaneous study of all four lakes in this heliothermal group would provide further insights into

7359,elevated levels of selenium se in aqueous environments can harm aquatic life and endanger livestock and human health although se occurs naturally in the rocks and soils of many alluvial aquifers mining and agricultural activities can increase its rate of mobilization and transport to surface waters attention is given here to regions where nonpoint source return flows from irrigated lands carry pollutant loads to aquifers and streams contributing to concentrations that violate regulatory and performance standards of particular concern is the heightened level and mobilization of se influenced by nitrate no3 a harmful pollutant in its own right we present a numerical model that simulates the reactive transport of se and nitrogen n species in a coupled groundwater surface water system building upon a conceptual model that incorporates the major processes affecting se and no3 transport in an irrigated watershed the model links the finite difference models modflow uzf rt3d and otis to simulate flow and reactive transport of multiple chemical species in both the aquifer and a stream network with mass exchange between the two the capability of the new model is showcased by calibration testing and application to a 500 km2 region in colorado s lower arkansas river valley using a rich data set gathered over a 10 yr period simulation of spatial and temporal distributions of se concentration reveals conditions that exceed standards in groundwater for approximately 20 of the area for the arkansas river standards are exceeded by 290 450 simulation indicates that river concentrations of no3 alone are near the current interim standard for the total of all dissolved n species these results indicate the need for future use of the developed model to investigate the prospects for land and water best management practices to decrease pollutant levels keywords selenium nitrate modeling modflow rt3d otis groundwater surface water interactions nonpoint source pollution irrigation 1 introduction selenium se is an essential micro nutrient for humans and animals but at elevated concentrations in water and plant material it can lead to diseases such as selenosis which can cause cirrhosis of the liver neurological damage fingernail brittleness and hair loss in humans goldhaber 2003 along with nervous system defects decrease in enzyme activity and inhibition of tissue growth in water fowl and fish populations flury et al 1997 hamilton 1998 kishchak 1998 skorupa 1998 se enters drinking water or consumable plants through its presence in soil aquifer and surface water systems and often is released from geologic formations such as cretaceous marine shale particularly in the presence of dissolved oxygen o2 and nitrate no3 seiler 1995 seiler 1997 bailey et al 2012 many river basins in the western united states are underlain by marine sedimentary rock seiler 1997 with se concentrations in groundwater reaching 12 000 µg l 1 in the san joaquin valley california fujii et al 1988 and 1410 µg l 1 in the arkansas river valley colorado gates et al 2009 2016 compared to the drinking water limit of 50 µg l 1 set by the usepa there is a growing need to first assess contamination levels in coupled aquifer stream systems and second to develop tools that can provide baseline conditions and quantify the comparative mobilization and movement of se under varying land and water management practices numerical models have been used more frequently in recent years to assess se contamination and to investigate remediation strategies models used for simulating se fate and transport in groundwater systems are based on solute mass conservation with solute transport governed by advection molecular diffusion mechanical dispersion sorption and chemical reactions such as chemical reduction and oxidation early attempts at simulating se transport focused on small scale one dimensional soil profiles models that accounted only for advection dispersion and sorption alemi et al 1988 alemi et al 1991 fio et al 1991 redox reactions were included in liu and narasimhan s 1994 study of se transport in groundwater at kesterson reservoir california guo et al 1999 initiated the use of first order kinetics in a modeling scheme to simulate se chemical reduction followed by the work of mirbagheri et al 2008 and tayfur et al 2010 that included se cycling in the soil plant system bailey et al 2013a expanded on their work by including the influence of o2 and no3 on se transformation kinetics necessitating the inclusion of nitrogen n cycling and transport their model used uzf rt3d bailey et al 2013b as the base groundwater reactive transport model which simulates multi species reactive transport in variably saturated porous media several studies have attempted se fate and transport simulation at larger scales two studies ahmad et al 2010 myers 2013 treated se as a conservative solute in pakistan and idaho respectively a third study bailey et al 2014 employed the se module for uzf rt3d at a regional 500 km2 scale in the lower arkansas river valley larv to investigate the impact of land and water management strategies on se concentrations in surficial groundwater and se mass loading from the aquifer to the arkansas river network the model however did not include solute transport within the stream network and hence did not have the capability to translate mass loadings to in stream concentration such capability is vital in coupled soil aquifer stream systems to compare in stream concentration with the latest us environmental protection agency usepa recommended chronic standard of 3 1 µgl 1 for protection of aquatic life usepa 2016 and thereby to determine impacts of best management practices bmps on downstream waterfowl and fish populations such capability also provides a further test of the model as observed surface water se concentrations serve as a constraint on the groundwater transport model although a number of models are available that simulate solute reactive transport in coupled groundwater surface water systems hydrogeosphere mike she cathy weill et al 2011 no models have been applied to simulating se fate and transport in a coupled stream aquifer system the objectives of this paper are two fold the first is to introduce a model for se transport in coupled groundwater surface water systems the model simulates reactive transport of se and n species in both variably saturated agricultural groundwater systems using uzf rt3d and a network of connected streams using a modified version of the one dimensional transport model otis runkel 1998 with mass exchange between groundwater and surface water cycling and transport of n in both systems is included due to the influence of no3 on se species transformation the coupled reactive transport model is referred to as rt3d otis groundwater flow gw groundwater hydraulic head groundwater sources and sinks streamflow sw stream stage and gw sw exchange rates between the aquifer and the stream network are provided by modflow nwt niswonger et al 2011 with the streamflow routing sfr2 niswonger and prudic 2005 and unsaturated zone flow uzf1 niswonger et al 2006 packages activated for simulating gw sw interaction and variably saturated flow respectively the second objective is to demonstrate the usefulness of the model through an application to a 500 km2 study region in the larv of southeastern colorado the model is tested against groundwater and in stream concentrations of se and no3 for the 2006 2009 time period using data from a network of observation wells and surface water sampling sites results demonstrate the model s usefulness in profiling the environmental consequences of irrigation induced nonpoint source pollution the tested model can be used in future studies to assess impacts of best management practices on selenium transport in the region following a description of se fate and transport in irrigated stream aquifer systems section 2 the rt3d otis model for se transport will be presented section 3 followed by the application to the larv section 4 2 conceptual

selenide se2 se ii masscheleyn and patrick 1993 selenide can be present in multiple forms for example as organic selenomethionine semet and as gaseous dimethylselenide dmse seo4 seo3 and semet are soluble species with seo4 being a weak sorbent to sediment ahlrichs and hossner 1987 and seo3 being a strong sorbent balistrieri and chao 1987 seo4 typically accounts for the vast majority of soluble se masscheleyn et al 1989 gates et al 2009 gerla et al 2011 and hence often is targeted for removal from the aqueous phase seo4 can be transformed to seo3 via microbial mediated chemical reduction oremland et al 1990 masscheleyn and patrick 1993 ellis and salt 2003 with further reduction to se0 and se2 possible this process however is inhibited by the presence of o2 and no3 weres et al 1990 white et al 1991 zhang and moore 1997 bailey et al 2012 due to microbial preference for higher redox species this inhibition is particularly significant in agricultural areas wherein irrigation induced drainage water discharging to streams can be high in o2 and no3 within cultivated systems se mass can undergo cycling in the soil plant water system shrift 1964 stolz et al 2002 with se being taken up into crop roots converted to organic se seorg and then tilled back into the soil after harvest seorg can then be mineralized to mobile seo4 and seo3 which in turn can be taken into the roots during the following growing season o2 and no3 also can affect se fate and transport through the oxidation of residual se in marine cretaceous shale present as seleno pyrite ii fesexs2 x in which se substitutes for sulfur s in pyrite fes2 bye and lund 1982 se is present in all soils byers 1937 but particularly in alluvial material overlying or adjacent to pyrite bearing shale regions that are irrigated and loaded with n fertilizer can lead to o2 and no3 coming into contact with pyrite bearing shale thereby mobilizing se and contributing to contamination of groundwater and nearby surface water seiler 1995 seiler 1997 within stream environments release of se to the atmosphere can occur through volatilization lemly 1999 dissolved se can be taken up by algae bennett et al 1986 riedel et al 1996 baines et al 2004 with seorg released upon algal respiration settling of se species mass to the stream sediment bed also can occur with further chemical reduction of these species occurring within the stream sediments se cycling masscheleyn and patrick 1993 lemly 1999 chapman et al 2010 occurs with se mass cycled between algal se biomass seorg seo4 and seo3 in the dissolved phase and se sorbed to sediment more details regarding flow of se mass in this system will be presented in section 3 2 within irrigated alluvial river valleys wherein a strong hydraulic connection between the alluvial aquifer and the stream network typically exists se mass also can be exchanged between the groundwater system and the surface water system resulting in substantial se mass loading to streams 3 rt3d otis coupled model for se fate and transport this section describes the model for se species reactive transport along with that for n species and o2 in coupled groundwater surface water systems in an agricultural watershed the equations for reactive transport in the aquifer will be presented first followed by the equations for reactive transport in a network of stream channels finally the method for exchanging water and solute mass between the two systems in a coupled modeling framework are presented the system under consideration by the modeling framework is depicted in the stream

with the stream network divided into physically uniform segments and each segment divided into a set of grid cells to implement otis in a multi stream network mass balance mixing calculations were used at stream junctions with physical parameters and segment lengths of each stream specified the concentration for each solute is specified at the upstream end of the main stem of the stream and any originating tributaries segment by segment flow rates lateral inflow outflow rates and cross section areas are provided by the sfr2 package of modflow the chemical reaction module developed for se includes se cycling with o2 and n species transport included due to the inhibition of se chemical reduction processes in the presence of o2 and no3 n cycling and o2 transport are simulated using the equations of qual2e fig 2b imbedded into the otis code chemical processes governing reactive transport of se species in the stream system are shown in fig 2c specific biochemical processes include algal uptake algal biomass conversion to seorg settling mineralization and assimilation volatilization and chemical reduction with first order reaction rate laws adopted similar to those used in qual2e the chemical reactions governing se cycling include only chemical reduction although chemical oxidation does occur in natural systems se redox reactions proceed much faster in the direction of reduction cooke and bruland 1987 losi and frankenberger 1998 guo et al 1999 with the slow rate of oxidation exacerbated in aquatic environments with high o2 and nutrient concentrations losi and frankenberger 1998 hence reduction rates herein represent the net chemical reduction of se for the current study denitrification has been added as a first order kinetic reaction which proceeds at near maximum rates when c o 2 is low total seorg excluding semet seo4 seo3 total volatilized se sevol and semet are treated as dissolved phase species with fate and reactive transport simulated using eq 8 whereas se0 and se2 are treated as solid phase species on the streambed with transformations simulated using eq 11 solute mass exchange between the water column and the streambed due to net sorption

method was implemented to solve the system of ordinary differential equations required for simulating the kinetics of interacting species and hence solve the n species and se species mass balance equations 3 3 coupling groundwater surface water reactive transport the flow of data in the coupled rt3d otis model is shown in fig 3 the model begins by reading in all necessary inputs including grid information initial solute concentration for each grid cell in the aquifer and in the stream network and parameters defining chemical reactions in both the aquifer and the stream system for each flow time step volumetric water content saturated zone hydraulic head and flow rates for each grid cell from the modflow sfr simulation are read into the code followed by a loop through the transport time steps to simulate change in concentration of all species in the groundwater system due to advection adv dispersion dsp source sinking mixing ssm and chemical reactions reactions the otis subroutine then is called with groundwater concentrations in cells adjacent to streams used as input to otis for lateral inflow if groundwater discharge to the stream is simulated by modflow sfr and surface water concentrations used for lateral outflow if stream seepage to the aquifer is simulated by modflow sfr the otis subroutine loops through the specified surface water transport time steps for each species and maps concentration values to uzf rt3d grid cells in preparation for the next groundwater transport time step required time step for otis calculations are typically much smaller than those for uzf rt3d e g hourly time steps vs daily time steps all subroutines required for otis and linking with uzf rt3d are contained in a new surface water transport swt package within rt3d otis which can be turned off to revert to original uzf rt3d simulations 3 4 additions for flow and transport in irrigated regions two additional modifications to the code were made to account for the movement of water and associated solute mass in a managed irrigated area first subroutines were included to account for the effect of irrigation tailwater runoff and associated solute mass on nearby streams tailwater runoff volumes are calculated in a pre processing step and included in the sfr2 input file solute concentrations in the tailwater are initially set equal to the solute concentration in the irrigation water applied to each field the solute mass tailwater volume solute concentration is then added to the nearby stream second subroutines were provided for solute concentration in the irrigation water to be determined in one of two ways a if the irrigation water originates from a canal that has a river diversion point outside the model domain the values for each mobile species are specified in uzf rt3d input files according to field sampled values or b if the canal diverts water from a point in the river that is inside the model domain the values are provided by the otis grid cell at that point 4 application to the lower arkansas river valley colorado the larv in semi arid southeastern colorado faces numerous challenges that are not uncommon in intensively irrigated alluvial valleys for more than 125 years an extensive network of earthen canals has diverted irrigation flows from the arkansas river for distribution over valley cropland which currently covers about 109 000 ha canal seepage and applied irrigation water in excess of crop evapotranspiration make their way back to the river and its tributaries as surface and subsurface flows subsurface return flows coupled with evaporative concentration have led to shallow saline groundwater tables which hinder crop productivity moreover these excess flows laden with o2 and with no3 from applied fertilizers move through weathered near surface and bedrock cretaceous shale formations dissolving and pushing salts and se into the stream network gates et al 2009 2016 bern and stogner 2017 surface return flows also may pick up salts no3 and se in route back to the stream system the result is river and tributary se concentrations that threaten wildlife livestock and human health the performance of the developed stream aquifer model is illustrated in application to a region that is representative of conditions in the larv upstream of john martin reservoir the region called the upstream study region usr in contrast to a downstream study region dsr located downstream of john martin reservoir covers about 50 600 ha 506 km2 fig 4 field data gathered in the usr over 2006 2011 from the stream concentration sampling sites shown in fig 4 indicate that cse in the river is about 4 times the usepa recommended freshwater se ambient chronic water quality criterion of 3 1 μg l for the protection of aquatic life usepa 2016 in addition the no3 species concentration c no 3 n alone is approaching the state of colorado interim standard of 2 mgl 1 for total dissolved n species no3 no2 nh4 the finite difference grid for the flow and transport stream aquifer model of the usr is shown in fig 5 a the model has 7777 cells of areal dimension 250 m 250 m with three active vertical layers used in modflow nwt and seven overlapping vertical layers used in rt3d otis the conversion from a three layer to seven layer grid is described in bailey et al 2014 grid cells for the modflow sfr package are located along the arkansas river and its tributaries for a total of 689 250 m long grid cells otis uses 50 m grid cells in the same locations with the stream network simulated by 13 connected stream segments with each section of the arkansas river between two tributaries designated as a segment the hydrologic features of the model domain are shown in fig 5b and include the arkansas river and its tributaries irrigation canals pumping wells and the cultivated fields that receive irrigation water the modflow sfr stress periods are weekly with one time step per stress period and the rt3d otis concurring time steps are daily embedded with hourly time steps in otis the modflow model is the same as the calibrated model described in morway et al 2013 with the use of the river package exchanged for the sfr2 package for streamflow simulation groundwater flow and transport boundary conditions are treated as described in morway et al 2013 and bailey et al 2014 a contour plot of simulated average water table elevation over the 1999 2009 time period from the original morway et al 2013 model is shown in fig 5c to provide an indication of groundwater flow patterns in the region also shown in fig 5d is the crop type for each cultivated field in 2006 crop type is used to specify fertilizer loading n uptake rate and crop root growth for each grid cell in the rt3d model 4 1 model calibration and testing the procedure for calibrating and testing the modflow sfr and rt3d otis models in application to the larv usr is outlined in fig 6 and generally follows the guidelines described by anderson et al 2015 and zheng and bennett 2002 for achieving a reasonable match between simulated and observed values of target variables testing of the modflow sfr model against groundwater levels and streamflow see fig 4 for locations of monitoring wells and stream gages was performed first followed by calibration of the rt3d otis model using a history matching approach wherein manual and automated methods were employed to minimize the residuals between simulated and observed equivalents over a historic period with the latter using the parameter estimation pest software package doherty 2016 finally a long term multi decadal simulation was run using the calibrated model parameters to check that outputs were physically reasonable both the modflow sfr and rt3d otis models were tested using the hold out method bennett et al 2013 where a data set from 2007 to 2009 distinct from the calibration data sets was set aside for further comparative evaluation of model simulations this resulted in a coupled model which was used to simulate baseline conditions in the larv usr the next sections describe the calibration of the flow and transport models in detail 4 1 1 modflow sfr refined calibration the original modflow model for the study region morway et al 2013 used the river package for simulating groundwater surface water exchange in this study the modflow model is modified to include streamflow routing through the use of the sfr2 package aquifer parameters from the original model are unchanged with only unit streambed conductance csb l2 t in the sfr2 package adjusted along the arkansas river and tributaries using manual calibration the model was tested against measured groundwater hydraulic heads estimated groundwater return flows total unaccounted for return flows derived from a river mass balance et estimated from a satellite remote sensing model and gaged stream flow the simulation period of january 1999 to december 2009 was divided into a calibration period january 1999 to october 2007 and a testing period november 2007 to december 2009 simulated groundwater head was compared to a total of 8704 water table measurements taken over the period april 1999 october 2007 from 88 monitoring wells fig 4 and an additional 699 water table measurements from these wells over november 2007 december 2009 simulated groundwater heads were compared to observed values using the sum of the squares mean and standard deviation of the residuals differences temporally averaged residuals between simulated and observed groundwater heads were plotted for each grid cell to identify locations near the arkansas river and its tributaries where adjustments in csb were needed simulated groundwater discharge to the arkansas river and its tributaries was compared to groundwater discharge estimated from a river mass balance over the period april 1999 to december 2009 for the october 2006 december 2009 period a stochastic river mass balance model of the study region was conducted following procedures similar to mueller price and gates 2008 but with a focused consideration of return flow as well as solute mass loading uncertainty associated with measurement error spatiotemporal variability and regression relationships between variables was employed in monte carlo simulation to estimate probability intervals of daily unaccounted for return flow i e flows not directly included in the river mass balance through gaged tributary flows canal diversions the la junta wastewater treatment effluent evaporative losses and channel storage change they include groundwater exchange with the arkansas river as well as surface flows to the river through ungaged tributaries and direct overland runoff values of these collective return flows simulated by modflow sfr were compared to the statistics from the stochastic mass balance et values computed by the uzf1 package of the modflow model were compared to values for corn a major crop in the area along with values for six minor crops computed satellite images processed using the reset model elhaddad and garcia 2008 2011 for the 2004 2005 and 2006 irrigation seasons comparisons were not made for pasture or for alfalfa the dominant crop in the region due to difficulties in estimating et over long periods for these crops using reset gates et al 2012 simulated streamflow was compared to measured streamflow at three gages along the arkansas river colorado division of water resources cdwr arkrocco rocky ford cdwr arklajco la junta usgs 07124000 las animas one gage in timpas creek usgs 07121500 one gage in crooked arroyo cdwr canswkco and one in horse creek cdwr hrc194co see fig 4 the raw gage data gathered on 15 min intervals were averaged over each weekly time step for comparing to simulated streamflow the magnitude and pattern of simulated and measured stream flows were compared visually in plots and quantitatively using the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nsce nash and sutcliffe 1970 the coefficient of efficiency e legates and mccabe 1999 the volumetric efficiency ve criss and winston 2008 and the coefficient of determination r2 these performance measures generally range from 0 to 1 with 1 indicating an ideal match between simulated and observed values however values for nsce and e can be negative for cases of poor match uncertainty due to measurement error in the gaged flow was estimated using the accuracy classifications as provided by the usgs novak 1985 fair which indicates a 95 inter percentile range difference between the 97 5th percentile and the 2 5th percentile values that corresponds to the range between 15 of the measured value for gages arkrocco arklajco 071240000 07121500 and canswkco and poor 95 inter percentile range between 20 of the measured value for hrc194co surface water runoff resulting from irrigation and precipitation rates in excess of soil infiltration capacity were calculated outside of modflow owing to numerous field scale studies within the larv that guided calibration of tailwater amounts gates et al 2012 total surface runoff was re inserted into appropriate i e topographically downgradient sfr segments for proper accounting of tailwater 4 1 2 rt3d otis calibration and testing crop parameter values and chemical reaction parameter values used in the rt3d otis model application are presented in tables s1 and s2 in supplemental information selected model input parameters for rt3d and otis were altered within a physically realistic range of values reported in the literature to obtain simulated groundwater concentrations mass loading to the arkansas river and stream concentrations that reasonably matched field values for both se and no3 these parameters are listed in table 3 and include denitrification heterotrophic and autotrophic and se chemical reduction parameters for heterotrophic reduction of no3 and seo4 rates are estimated for riparian areas and for non riparian areas due to the enhanced carbon cycling and bacterial activity that occurs in vegetation rich soil groundwater systems a recursive manual and automated calibration procedure with the latter using pest was used to obtain parameter value estimates measured groundwater and in stream se and no3 concentrations and groundwater to stream mass loadings were available during 2006 2009 providing a model calibration period defined as june 19th 2006 to march 20th 2008 and a testing period of march 21st 2008 to october 31st 2009 six different calibration targets were assessed 1 average groundwater cse in defined grouping areas see fig 5a for the 13 grouping areas 2 average groundwater c no 3 n in the grouping areas unaccounted for mass loading of 3 se and 4 no3 to the arkansas river which includes loading from groundwater discharge and from un gaged surface runoff and 5 in stream cse and 6 c no 3 n in the arkansas river and tributaries performance of the rt3d otis model in predicting cse and c no 3 n in groundwater was tested using a methodology similar to that described by bailey et al 2014 in grouping measurements of groundwater concentration in monitoring wells by canal command areas in the present study concentration measurements were grouped within areas that were defined by their proximity to 13 respective stream segments the rationale for this grouping was the assumption that chemical reactions in riparian areas control cse and c no 3 n in both the shallow aquifer and the adjacent stream reaches depth averaged simulated values of cse and c no 3 n in groundwater cells within each grouping area were compared with statistics of corresponding observed values stochastic estimates of unaccounted for se and no3 mass entering the arkansas river were used in the calibration process the approach was similar to that described for the evaluation of simulated unaccounted for groundwater return flows see section 4 1 1 results from the stochastic mass balance were available for the period october 1st 2006 to october 31st 2009 when both ec and flow data were available at the stream gages simulated mass loading over these dates were compared to statistics characterizing the estimated uncertainty in the river mass balance calculations net sinks and sources due to in stream chemical reactions were assumed negligible over the river reach in this analysis the time averaged value of the ensemble coefficient of variation cv was used as a composite measure of the level of uncertainty in se and no3 loads computed by river mass balance analysis measured in stream cse and c no 3 n were compared to simulated values for each computational stream segment that contained a sample location and for the corresponding day that the sample was collected four dates of observations within the calibration period were available for use between 6 19 2006 and 3 20 2008 and five dates within the testing period between 6 23 2008 and 7 22 2009 in total there are seven sampling locations within the arkansas river and three within selected tributaries see fig 4 for locations to estimate the uncertainty related to the discrepancy in the temporal scale an analysis was conducted of the temporal variability in the residuals of instantaneous either 15 min or 30 min intervals measurements of ec from the daily average ec value which was subsequently applied to cse and c no 3 n based on a regression relationships between ec and cse and between ec and c no 3 n developed using procedures similar to mueller price and gates 2008 the computed cv of these residuals was used to represent the uncertainty associated with temporal scale discrepancy between observed and simulated values of cse and c no 3 n the cv representing uncertainty in spatial scale discrepancy between cse and c no 3 n values measured at a point within a computational river segment and the model computed average values over the river segment was assumed to be equal to the cv computed for the temporal scale uncertainty uncertainty due to measurement error was assessed using the cvs of pairwise differences between values of cse in 40 duplicate sample sets and between values of c no 3 n in 108 duplicate sample sets from streams and groundwater a composite measure of uncertainty derived from spatiotemporal variability and measurement error was computed as the square root of the sum of the squares of the cvs casella and berger 2002 for temporal scale discrepancy spatial scale discrepancy and measurement error a combination of manual and automated calibration guided by earlier investigations and sensitivity analyses was used to adjust selected groundwater and surface water parameters to achieve an adequate match of rt3d otis simulations to the six calibration targets within the larv usr the calibration procedure is outlined in the following steps 1 chemical reaction rates within the cells that represent the riparian corridor adjacent to the arkansas river and its tributaries were selected for adjustment within uzf rt3d rates of heterotrophic chemical reduction of no3 and seo4 λ no 3 het and λ seo 4 het respectively the rate of heterotrophic reduction of seo3 to elemental se and mobile semet λ seo 3 het and the rate of heterotrophic reduction of semet λ semet het this approach was based upon previous studies that highlight the key role of heterotrophic chemical reduction in lowering the concentration of redox sensitive pollutants in riparian and hyporheic zones hill 1996 spruill 2000 vidon and hill 2004 dosskey et al 2010 ranalli and macalady 2010 bailey et al 2015 huizenga et al 2017 2 based on an initial sensitivity analysis the following parameters where chosen for adjustment in the otis model λ seo 4 λ seo 4 vol λ seo 4 assim df no 3 n and ρ mass of accessible sediment per volume of stream water 3 all parameters are initially set to values that had been previously determined by morway et al 2013 bailey et al 2014 and bailey and ahmadi 2014 due to the long simulation time required for parameters to influence chemical transport in the aquifer a long term 40 year rt3d otis simulation is run to determine the effect of the parameters on groundwater and in stream concentrations the simulation consisted of repeating hydrologic and irrigation conditions from 1999 to 2009 results were compared the different calibration period targets followed by a manual adjustment and re run of the simulation during the course of the manual calibration it was deemed necessary to add λ no 3 auto λ no 3 het λ seo 4 het λ seo 3 het λ semet het and kse within the non riparian areas to the set of parameters to be calibrated 4 pest was run using parameter values obtained from the manual calibration pest iteratively adjusts parameter values to minimize the sum of the squared weighted residuals the objective function between the simulated values and observed values of all variables associated with the six designated calibration targets during the calibration period june 19th 2006 to march 20th 2008 weights were assigned to account for differences in measurement scale and level of uncertainty among the variables the calibrated parameter values determined by pest were used in another 40 yr simulation to check for unreasonable long term drift caused by the required long period of time for altered parameter values to fully affect groundwater concentrations in simulated concentrations and loads further manual adjustment of pest calibrated parameter values was conducted to remove such long term drift 5 a further confirmation of the calibrated model was made by comparing model simulations to observed values within the test period march 21st 2008 to october 31st 2009 4 2 calibration and testing results 4 2 1 modflow sfr calibration and testing results temporal averaged values of csb in the sfr stream segments determined from manual calibration varied from 0 67 m2d 1m 1 to 23 700 m2d 1m 1 with an average value of 537 m2d 1m 1 over the stream segments in the arkansas river and from 0 005 m2d 1m 1 to 50 6 m2d 1m 1 with an average value of 9 7 m2d 1m 1 over the stream segments in the tributaries these values are comparable to those reported and used in the literature for alluvial streams hunt et al 2001 chen and shu 2002 fox 2007 modflow sfr results are shown in figs 7 9 relative frequency histograms of groundwater head residuals computed as the difference between modflow sfr simulated groundwater head and the groundwater head observed in the monitoring well situated within each corresponding cell are shown in fig 7 these residuals presented for both the calibration and testing periods indicate a good model performance in simulating groundwater head black bars depict the standard deviation inter percentile range of the residuals i e the range between the mean plus one standard deviation and the mean minus one standard deviation the red bars depict the range in uncertainty of observed head values over the spatial area of a grid cell 6 25 ha and the model time step of 1 week based on field results described in morway et al 2013 the uncertainty is estimated to be 0 53 m comparison of the red and black bars provides an indication of the fraction of the total variability in the residuals that is contributed by scale discrepancy the root mean square error rmse of the simulated values compared to the observed values was 2 23 m and 2 83 m for the calibration and testing periods respectively the average residual was 0 02 m and 0 41 m for the calibration and testing periods respectively the calibration period residuals shown in fig 7a for the modflow sfr model are very similar to those resulting from the modflow model that used the river package for the study region morway et al 2013 fig 8 shows the groundwater plus unmeasured surface return flow simulated by modflow sfr which are generally within the 95 inter percentile range estimated by stochastic river mass balance as seen in fig 8 there are several short duration spikes in the mass balance estimates that are not captured in the modflow sfr simulation these spikes could be due to rapid runoff during large precipitation events from the desert areas to the south of the irrigated areas which are not represented in the flow model markers in fig 8 show the time of precipitation events within the model domain that were estimated greater than 2 5 cm 1 in in depth these events appear to coincide with some of the spikes in the mass balance results but not all of them et from cropped cells computed by the modflow sfr model was reasonably comparable to that computed by the reset model over the same time period the average percent differences over the years 2004 2006 were 0 1 for melons which cover about 1 5 of the cropped area in the usr over the 2004 2006 period 0 2 for corn which covers about 9 5 4 for vegetables which covers about 1 12 8 for beans which cover about 5 32 6 for onions which cover about 1 38 1 for spring grain which covers about 6 and 44 3 for sorghum which covers about 12 fig 9 shows comparative time series of weekly average flow rate measured at stream gages arkrocco arklajco and 07 124 000 on the arkansas river along with simulated flow rates which represent both a weekly average and an average over the corresponding river segment containing the stream gage uncertainty due to measurement error is depicted by the 95 inter percentile range based upon the usgs accuracy rating these plots depict a generally good correspondence between simulated and observed streamflows in both magnitude and temporal variability table 2 summarizes the comparison of the model predicted flows with the gaged values using the performance measures described above results indicate a fairly good match for the arkansas river segments but a poorer match for the tributaries the poorer model performance in simulating tributary flows is due to the model assumption that inflow into the upstream end of the tributaries from outside the model domain is negligible an assumption that is necessary owing to the difficulty in estimating ungaged tributary inflow to the modeled area and due to difficulty in matching the timing and rate of return flows to tributaries 4 2 2 rt3d otis calibration and testing results parameter values resulting from the rt3d otis calibration process are summarized in tables 3 and 4 for the groundwater and surface water parameters respectively these values are within ranges reported in the literature guo et al 1999 2000 chow et al 2004 fujita et al 2005 also see cumulative distribution functions of compiled reaction rates presented in figs s1 and s2 in supplemental information results for system response variables are shown in figs 10 13 fig 10 shows simulated groundwater c seo 4 c seo 3 and c no 3 n averaged over the 2006 2009 simulation period the overall spatial average of the temporally averaged cell wise values for c seo 4 c seo 3 and c no 3 n are 46 μg l 7 μg l and 3 mg l respectively generally areas of high c seo 4 correspond to areas of high c no 3 n particularly in vicinities with high fertilizer loading e g corn see fig 5d also areas of high c seo 4 correspond to areas of high c seo 3 due to chemical reduction of seo4 to seo3 when o2 and no3 are below inhibition thresholds as shown in fig 11 comparison between average observed and simulated values for the 13 grouping areas is good for this analysis simulated c seo 4 and c seo 3 are added to determine cse whiskers on the plotted observed means represent one standard deviation of all observed values within each grouping area providing a measure of the uncertainty derived from scale discrepancy and from measurement error in light of this uncertainty simulated values are quite comparable to observations especially for cse model under prediction of c no 3 n compared to observations in some of the grouping areas may be due at least in part to the fact that the model simulated averages are biased by low values computed within the riparian zone where values are especially affected by chemical reduction whereas the observed values come from locations outside the riparian zone interestingly the values of simulated groundwater concentrations in the testing period yield a better match to observed values for both cse and c no 3 n a large incongruity is in grouping area 13 where the model output is much higher than the observed concentration in this area there are very few groundwater monitoring wells suggesting the possibility that the few available observed values are not representative of conditions in other parts of the grouping area in addition measured values may not represent adequately the actual aquifer conditions throughout an entire irrigation command area although the model captures the major trends and magnitudes of cse and c no 3 n comparisons at a point are not always good this is due to spatio temporal averaging of hydro chemical processes e g computing solute concentration across a 6 25 ha grid cell and over a 1 day period in addition matching simulated and measured values at specific points monitoring well locations in the aquifer was not the objective of the calibration process which could have been achieved with varying chemical reaction parameter values on a cell by cell basis rather the objective is to capture the regional trends in solute contamination and transport finally model input constraints such as the requirement of temporally constant parameter values also limited the ability of the model to represent changes in conditions in the system that may cause parameter value adjustments over time fig 12 shows the simulated mass loading of se and no3 in groundwater and unmeasured surface water returns to the arkansas river along with statistics of the mass loading computed from the stochastic river mass balance for a period spanning 2006 2009 includes portions of both the calibration and testing periods the mass balance results assume that net sinks and sources of se and no3 within the entire river reach are small compared to loads in surface and subsurface return flows the model predicted mass loading is generally well within one standard deviation of the distribution of mass loading predicted by stochastic mass balance for both se and no3 but less so for no3 fig 13 shows time series plots of model simulated cse and c no 3 n at seven locations along the arkansas river fig 13a g and at locations within three tributaries fig 13h j along with observed values results for both the calibration and testing periods are shown these comparisons indicate visually that the model provides an acceptable match with measured values regarding magnitude and spatiotemporal variability of stream concentrations moreover for many locations increases and decreases in concentration between consecutive simulations are matched by corresponding increases and decreases in the observed concentrations results for the tributaries fig 13h j for both cse and c no 3 n demonstrate the ability of the model to accurately simulate mass loadings from the aquifer to streams since flows in these large surface drains typically originate in large part from groundwater as such the connection between rt3d and otis within the modflow sfr modeling framework allows for reasonably accurate simulation of cse and c no 3 n mass loading from the aquifer to the stream network throughout the study region 4 3 appraisal of conditions compared to water quality standards model results were used to delineate approximate aquifer and stream zones wherein concentrations of se and no3 n are above regulatory water quality standards for se the maximum contamination level mcl established by the usepa is 50 μg l fig 14 a shows areas shaded wherein groundwater cse is greater than this level see fig 10a for actual simulated concentrations equal to approximately 20 of the study region in contrast the drinking water standard for se established by the european union council directive 98 83 ec is 10 μg l resulting in 75 of the study region not in compliance fig 14b the no3 n drinking water limit established by the usepa and eu is 10 mg l and 11 3 mg l respectively resulting in 4 and 3 of the aquifer system not in compliance fig 14c and d fig 15 compares simulated in stream concentrations against water quality standards fig 15a shows the 85th percentile value of cse averaged over the 2006 2009 simulation period plotted along the extent of the arkansas river within the usr along with the current usepa recommended chronic standard of 3 1 μg l results indicate a high degree of violation extending from 3 9 to 5 5 times the standard along the river reach simulated average values of c no 3 n fig 15b spread between values equivalent to 76 and 102 of the plotted usepa chronic standard for total n demonstrating the reason for growing concern about n pollution in the larv abrupt changes in concentrations shown in fig 15 are due to either the effects of tributary inflows to the arkansas river or high volume canal diversions causing local groundwater concentrations to significantly affect in stream concentrations 5 summary and conclusions this paper presents a spatially distributed physically based finite difference model rt3d otis which simulates the fate and transport of selenium se species in a coupled groundwater surface water system due to the influence of no3 on se speciation and transport the cycling of n and transport of n species in these systems also was considered the resulting model accounts for the major processes and mass sources sinks that govern se mobilization and reactive transport in agriculturally influenced aquifers and streams including sorption redox reactions release from marine shale soil cycling and crop uptake groundwater pumping canal seepage applied irrigation water and groundwater surface water interactions all flow rates and sources sinks are provided by an accompanying modflow model based on previous se groundwater models the aim of rt3d otis is to simulate spatiotemporal distributions of se and n species within and between an aquifer and its interconnected streams at a regional scale it is showcased in an application to a region in colorado s lower arkansas river valley an area with a long history of irrigated agriculture which faces challenges to control nonpoint source pollution to meet regulatory standards a problem facing many of the world s vital irrigated regions an extensive data set gathered over a 10 yr period along with the results of river flow and mass balance analyses provided an abundant and diverse set of targets for model calibration and confirmation the calibrated model was run to compare baseline conditions within the aquifer and stream network to drinking water and aquatic life standards spatial and temporal patterns of simulated concentrations reveal extreme violation of usepa s se standards in both the aquifer 20 of the aquifer area by usepa drinking water standards 75 by eu standards and the streams 3 9 to 5 5 times higher than usepa chronic standard moderate violation of no3 standards in the aquifer and near violation of the interim stream standard for total nitrogen n successful application to the larv suggests the utility of the model for regional assessment of se and n in application to other similar stream aquifer systems the stage is now set for employing the model to forecast comparisons of conditions under

7359,elevated levels of selenium se in aqueous environments can harm aquatic life and endanger livestock and human health although se occurs naturally in the rocks and soils of many alluvial aquifers mining and agricultural activities can increase its rate of mobilization and transport to surface waters attention is given here to regions where nonpoint source return flows from irrigated lands carry pollutant loads to aquifers and streams contributing to concentrations that violate regulatory and performance standards of particular concern is the heightened level and mobilization of se influenced by nitrate no3 a harmful pollutant in its own right we present a numerical model that simulates the reactive transport of se and nitrogen n species in a coupled groundwater surface water system building upon a conceptual model that incorporates the major processes affecting se and no3 transport in an irrigated watershed the model links the finite difference models modflow uzf rt3d and otis to simulate flow and reactive transport of multiple chemical species in both the aquifer and a stream network with mass exchange between the two the capability of the new model is showcased by calibration testing and application to a 500 km2 region in colorado s lower arkansas river valley using a rich data set gathered over a 10 yr period simulation of spatial and temporal distributions of se concentration reveals conditions that exceed standards in groundwater for approximately 20 of the area for the arkansas river standards are exceeded by 290 450 simulation indicates that river concentrations of no3 alone are near the current interim standard for the total of all dissolved n species these results indicate the need for future use of the developed model to investigate the prospects for land and water best management practices to decrease pollutant levels keywords selenium nitrate modeling modflow rt3d otis groundwater surface water interactions nonpoint source pollution irrigation 1 introduction selenium se is an essential micro nutrient for humans and animals but at elevated concentrations in water and plant material it can lead to diseases such as selenosis which can cause cirrhosis of the liver neurological damage fingernail brittleness and hair loss in humans goldhaber 2003 along with nervous system defects decrease in enzyme activity and inhibition of tissue growth in water fowl and fish populations flury et al 1997 hamilton 1998 kishchak 1998 skorupa 1998 se enters drinking water or consumable plants through its presence in soil aquifer and surface water systems and often is released from geologic formations such as cretaceous marine shale particularly in the presence of dissolved oxygen o2 and nitrate no3 seiler 1995 seiler 1997 bailey et al 2012 many river basins in the western united states are underlain by marine sedimentary rock seiler 1997 with se concentrations in groundwater reaching 12 000 µg l 1 in the san joaquin valley california fujii et al 1988 and 1410 µg l 1 in the arkansas river valley colorado gates et al 2009 2016 compared to the drinking water limit of 50 µg l 1 set by the usepa there is a growing need to first assess contamination levels in coupled aquifer stream systems and second to develop tools that can provide baseline conditions and quantify the comparative mobilization and movement of se under varying land and water management practices numerical models have been used more frequently in recent years to assess se contamination and to investigate remediation strategies models used for simulating se fate and transport in groundwater systems are based on solute mass conservation with solute transport governed by advection molecular diffusion mechanical dispersion sorption and chemical reactions such as chemical reduction and oxidation early attempts at simulating se transport focused on small scale one dimensional soil profiles models that accounted only for advection dispersion and sorption alemi et al 1988 alemi et al 1991 fio et al 1991 redox reactions were included in liu and narasimhan s 1994 study of se transport in groundwater at kesterson reservoir california guo et al 1999 initiated the use of first order kinetics in a modeling scheme to simulate se chemical reduction followed by the work of mirbagheri et al 2008 and tayfur et al 2010 that included se cycling in the soil plant system bailey et al 2013a expanded on their work by including the influence of o2 and no3 on se transformation kinetics necessitating the inclusion of nitrogen n cycling and transport their model used uzf rt3d bailey et al 2013b as the base groundwater reactive transport model which simulates multi species reactive transport in variably saturated porous media several studies have attempted se fate and transport simulation at larger scales two studies ahmad et al 2010 myers 2013 treated se as a conservative solute in pakistan and idaho respectively a third study bailey et al 2014 employed the se module for uzf rt3d at a regional 500 km2 scale in the lower arkansas river valley larv to investigate the impact of land and water management strategies on se concentrations in surficial groundwater and se mass loading from the aquifer to the arkansas river network the model however did not include solute transport within the stream network and hence did not have the capability to translate mass loadings to in stream concentration such capability is vital in coupled soil aquifer stream systems to compare in stream concentration with the latest us environmental protection agency usepa recommended chronic standard of 3 1 µgl 1 for protection of aquatic life usepa 2016 and thereby to determine impacts of best management practices bmps on downstream waterfowl and fish populations such capability also provides a further test of the model as observed surface water se concentrations serve as a constraint on the groundwater transport model although a number of models are available that simulate solute reactive transport in coupled groundwater surface water systems hydrogeosphere mike she cathy weill et al 2011 no models have been applied to simulating se fate and transport in a coupled stream aquifer system the objectives of this paper are two fold the first is to introduce a model for se transport in coupled groundwater surface water systems the model simulates reactive transport of se and n species in both variably saturated agricultural groundwater systems using uzf rt3d and a network of connected streams using a modified version of the one dimensional transport model otis runkel 1998 with mass exchange between groundwater and surface water cycling and transport of n in both systems is included due to the influence of no3 on se species transformation the coupled reactive transport model is referred to as rt3d otis groundwater flow gw groundwater hydraulic head groundwater sources and sinks streamflow sw stream stage and gw sw exchange rates between the aquifer and the stream network are provided by modflow nwt niswonger et al 2011 with the streamflow routing sfr2 niswonger and prudic 2005 and unsaturated zone flow uzf1 niswonger et al 2006 packages activated for simulating gw sw interaction and variably saturated flow respectively the second objective is to demonstrate the usefulness of the model through an application to a 500 km2 study region in the larv of southeastern colorado the model is tested against groundwater and in stream concentrations of se and no3 for the 2006 2009 time period using data from a network of observation wells and surface water sampling sites results demonstrate the model s usefulness in profiling the environmental consequences of irrigation induced nonpoint source pollution the tested model can be used in future studies to assess impacts of best management practices on selenium transport in the region following a description of se fate and transport in irrigated stream aquifer systems section 2 the rt3d otis model for se transport will be presented section 3 followed by the application to the larv section 4 2 conceptual model of se fate and transport in a stream aquifer system se can exist in environmental water systems in four oxidation states selenate seo4 se vi selenite seo3 se iv elemental se se0 se 0 and selenide se2 se ii masscheleyn and patrick 1993 selenide can be present in multiple forms for example as organic selenomethionine semet and as gaseous dimethylselenide dmse seo4 seo3 and semet are soluble species with seo4 being a weak sorbent to sediment ahlrichs and hossner 1987 and seo3 being a strong sorbent balistrieri and chao 1987 seo4 typically accounts for the vast majority of soluble se masscheleyn et al 1989 gates et al 2009 gerla et al 2011 and hence often is targeted for removal from the aqueous phase seo4 can be transformed to seo3 via microbial mediated chemical reduction oremland et al 1990 masscheleyn and patrick 1993 ellis and salt 2003 with further reduction to se0 and se2 possible this process however is inhibited by the presence of o2 and no3 weres et al 1990 white et al 1991 zhang and moore 1997 bailey et al 2012 due to microbial preference for higher redox species this inhibition is particularly significant in agricultural areas wherein irrigation induced drainage water discharging to streams can be high in o2 and no3 within cultivated systems se mass can undergo cycling in the soil plant water system shrift 1964 stolz et al 2002 with se being taken up into crop roots converted to organic se seorg and then tilled back into the soil after harvest seorg can then be mineralized to mobile seo4 and seo3 which in turn can be taken into the roots during the following growing season o2 and no3 also can affect se fate and transport through the oxidation of residual se in marine cretaceous shale present as seleno pyrite ii fesexs2 x in which se substitutes for sulfur s in pyrite fes2 bye and lund 1982 se is present in all soils byers 1937 but particularly in alluvial material overlying or adjacent to pyrite bearing shale regions that are irrigated and loaded with n fertilizer can lead to o2 and no3 coming into contact with pyrite bearing shale thereby mobilizing se and contributing to contamination of groundwater and nearby surface water seiler 1995 seiler 1997 within stream environments release of se to the atmosphere can occur through volatilization lemly 1999 dissolved se can be taken up by algae bennett et al 1986 riedel et al 1996 baines et al 2004 with seorg released upon algal respiration settling of se species mass to the stream sediment bed also can occur with further chemical reduction of these species occurring within the stream sediments se cycling masscheleyn and patrick 1993 lemly 1999 chapman et al 2010 occurs with se mass cycled between algal se biomass seorg seo4 and seo3 in the dissolved phase and se sorbed to sediment more details regarding flow of se mass in this system will be presented in section 3 2 within irrigated alluvial river valleys wherein a strong hydraulic connection between the alluvial aquifer and the stream network typically exists se mass also can be exchanged between the groundwater system and the surface water system resulting in substantial se mass loading to streams 3 rt3d otis coupled model for se fate and transport this section describes the model for se species reactive transport along with that for n species and o2 in coupled groundwater surface water systems in an agricultural watershed the equations for reactive transport in the aquifer will be presented first followed by the equations for reactive transport in a network of stream channels finally the method for exchanging water and solute mass between the two systems in a coupled modeling framework are presented the system under consideration by the modeling framework is depicted in the stream

includes se cycling with o2 and n species transport included due to the inhibition of se chemical reduction processes in the presence of o2 and no3 n cycling and o2 transport are simulated using the equations of qual2e fig 2b imbedded into the otis code chemical processes governing reactive transport of se species in the stream system are shown in fig 2c specific biochemical processes include algal uptake algal biomass conversion to seorg settling mineralization and assimilation volatilization and chemical reduction with first order reaction rate laws adopted similar to those used in qual2e the chemical reactions governing se cycling include only chemical reduction although chemical oxidation does occur in natural systems se redox reactions proceed much faster in the direction of reduction cooke and bruland 1987 losi and frankenberger 1998 guo et al 1999 with the slow rate of oxidation exacerbated in aquatic environments with high o2 and nutrient concentrations losi and frankenberger 1998 hence reduction rates herein represent the net chemical reduction of se for the current study denitrification has been added as a first order kinetic reaction which proceeds at near maximum rates when c o 2 is low total seorg excluding semet seo4 seo3 total volatilized se sevol and semet are treated as dissolved phase species with fate and reactive transport simulated using eq 8

has become a particulate in the form of sorbed seo4 sorbed seo3 se0 or se2 it becomes a part of the net sediment sink where re suspension into the water column does not occur the 4th order runge kutta method was implemented to solve the system of ordinary differential equations required for simulating the kinetics of interacting species and hence solve the n species and se species mass balance equations 3 3 coupling groundwater surface water reactive transport the flow of data in the coupled rt3d otis model is shown in fig 3 the model begins by reading in all necessary inputs including grid information initial solute concentration for each grid cell in the aquifer and in the stream network and parameters defining chemical reactions in both the aquifer and the stream system for each flow time step volumetric water content saturated zone hydraulic head and flow rates for each grid cell from the modflow sfr simulation are read into the code followed by a loop through the transport time steps to simulate change in concentration of all species in the groundwater system due to advection adv dispersion dsp source sinking mixing ssm and chemical reactions reactions the otis subroutine then is called with groundwater concentrations in cells adjacent to streams used as input to otis for lateral inflow if groundwater discharge to the stream is simulated by modflow sfr and surface water concentrations used for lateral outflow if stream seepage to the aquifer is simulated by modflow sfr the otis subroutine loops through the specified surface water transport time steps for each species and maps concentration values to uzf rt3d grid cells in preparation for the next groundwater transport time step required time step for otis calculations are typically much smaller than those for uzf rt3d e g hourly time steps vs daily time steps all subroutines required for otis and linking with uzf rt3d are contained in a new surface water transport swt package within rt3d otis which can be turned off to revert to original uzf rt3d simulations 3 4 additions for flow and transport in irrigated regions two additional modifications to the code were made to account for the movement of water and associated solute mass in a managed irrigated area first subroutines were included to account for the effect of irrigation tailwater runoff and associated solute mass on nearby streams tailwater runoff volumes are calculated in a pre processing step and included in the sfr2 input file solute concentrations in the tailwater are initially set equal to the solute concentration in the irrigation water applied to each field the solute mass tailwater volume solute concentration is then added to the nearby stream second subroutines were provided for solute concentration in the irrigation water to be determined in one of two ways a if the irrigation water originates from a canal that has a river diversion point outside the model domain the values for each mobile species are specified in uzf rt3d input files according to field sampled values or b if the canal diverts water from a point in the river that is inside the model domain the values are provided by the otis grid cell at that point 4 application to the lower arkansas river valley colorado the larv in semi arid southeastern colorado faces numerous challenges that are not uncommon in intensively irrigated alluvial valleys for more than 125 years an extensive network of earthen canals has diverted irrigation flows from the arkansas river for distribution over valley cropland which currently covers about 109 000 ha canal seepage and applied irrigation water in excess of crop evapotranspiration make their way back to the river and its tributaries as surface and subsurface flows subsurface return flows coupled with evaporative concentration have led to shallow saline groundwater tables which hinder crop productivity moreover these excess flows laden with o2 and with no3 from applied fertilizers move through weathered near surface and bedrock cretaceous shale formations dissolving and pushing salts and se into the stream network gates et al 2009 2016 bern and stogner 2017 surface return flows also may pick up salts no3 and se in route back to the stream system the result is river and tributary se concentrations that threaten wildlife livestock and human health the performance of the developed stream aquifer model is illustrated in application to a region that is representative of conditions in the larv upstream of john martin reservoir the region called the upstream study region usr in contrast to a downstream study region dsr located downstream of john martin reservoir covers about 50 600 ha 506 km2 fig 4 field data gathered in the usr over 2006 2011 from the stream concentration sampling sites shown in fig 4 indicate that cse in the river is about 4 times the usepa recommended freshwater se ambient chronic water quality criterion of 3 1 μg l for the protection of aquatic life usepa 2016 in addition the no3 species concentration c no 3 n alone is approaching the state of colorado interim standard of 2 mgl 1 for total dissolved n species no3 no2 nh4 the finite difference grid for the flow and transport stream aquifer model of the usr is shown in fig 5 a the model has 7777 cells of areal dimension 250 m 250 m with three active vertical layers used in modflow nwt and seven overlapping vertical layers used in rt3d otis the conversion from a three layer to seven layer grid is described in bailey et al 2014 grid cells for the modflow sfr package are located along the arkansas river and its tributaries for a total of 689 250 m long grid cells otis uses 50 m grid cells in the same locations with the stream network simulated by 13 connected stream segments with each section of the arkansas river between two tributaries designated as a segment the hydrologic features of the model domain are shown in fig 5b and include the arkansas river and its tributaries irrigation canals pumping wells and the cultivated fields that receive irrigation water the modflow sfr stress periods are weekly with one time step per stress period and the rt3d otis concurring time steps are daily embedded with hourly time steps in otis the modflow model is the same as the calibrated model described in morway et al 2013 with the use of the river package exchanged for the sfr2 package for streamflow simulation groundwater flow and transport boundary conditions are treated as described in morway et al 2013 and bailey et al 2014 a contour plot of simulated average water table elevation over the 1999 2009 time period from the original morway et al 2013 model is shown in fig 5c to provide an indication of groundwater flow patterns in the region also shown in fig 5d is the crop type for each cultivated field in 2006 crop type is used to specify fertilizer loading n uptake rate and crop root growth for each grid cell in the rt3d model 4 1 model calibration and testing the procedure for calibrating and testing the modflow sfr and rt3d otis models in application to the larv usr is outlined in fig 6 and generally follows the guidelines described by anderson et al 2015 and zheng and bennett 2002 for achieving a reasonable match between simulated and observed values of target variables testing of the modflow sfr model against groundwater levels and streamflow see fig 4 for locations of monitoring wells and stream gages was performed first followed by calibration of the rt3d otis model using a history matching approach wherein manual and automated methods were employed to minimize the residuals between simulated and observed equivalents over a historic period with the latter using the parameter estimation pest software package doherty 2016 finally a long term multi decadal simulation was run using the calibrated model parameters to check that outputs were physically reasonable both the modflow sfr and rt3d otis models were tested using the hold out method bennett et al 2013 where a data set from 2007 to 2009 distinct from the calibration data sets was set aside for further comparative evaluation of model simulations this resulted in a coupled model which was used to simulate baseline conditions in the larv usr the next sections describe the calibration of the flow and transport models in detail 4 1 1 modflow sfr refined calibration the original modflow model for the study region morway et al 2013 used the river package for simulating groundwater surface water exchange in this study the modflow model is modified to include streamflow routing through the use of the sfr2 package aquifer parameters from the original model are unchanged with only unit streambed conductance csb l2 t in the sfr2 package adjusted along the arkansas river and tributaries using manual calibration the model was tested against measured groundwater hydraulic heads estimated groundwater return flows total unaccounted for return flows derived from a river mass balance et estimated from a satellite remote sensing model and gaged stream flow the simulation period of january 1999 to december 2009 was divided into a calibration period january 1999 to october 2007 and a testing period november 2007 to december 2009 simulated groundwater head was compared to a total of 8704 water table measurements taken over the period april 1999 october 2007 from 88 monitoring wells fig 4 and an additional 699 water table measurements from these wells over november 2007 december 2009 simulated groundwater heads were compared to observed values using the sum of the squares mean and standard deviation of the residuals differences temporally averaged residuals between simulated and observed groundwater heads were plotted for each grid cell to identify locations near the arkansas river and its tributaries where adjustments in csb were needed simulated groundwater discharge to the arkansas river and its tributaries was compared to groundwater discharge estimated from a river mass balance over the period april 1999 to december 2009 for the october 2006 december 2009 period a stochastic river mass balance model of the study region was conducted following procedures similar to mueller price and gates 2008 but with a focused consideration of return flow as well as solute mass loading uncertainty associated with measurement error spatiotemporal variability and regression relationships between variables was employed in monte carlo simulation to estimate probability intervals of daily unaccounted for return flow i e flows not directly included in the river mass balance through gaged tributary flows canal diversions the la junta wastewater treatment effluent evaporative losses and channel storage change they include groundwater exchange with the arkansas river as well as surface flows to the river through ungaged tributaries and direct overland runoff values of these collective return flows simulated by modflow sfr were compared to the statistics from the stochastic mass balance et values computed by the uzf1 package of the modflow model were compared to values for corn a major crop in the area along with values for six minor crops computed satellite images processed using the reset model elhaddad and garcia 2008 2011 for the 2004 2005 and 2006 irrigation seasons comparisons were not made for pasture or for alfalfa the dominant crop in the region due to difficulties in estimating et over long periods for these crops using reset gates et al 2012 simulated streamflow was compared to measured streamflow at three gages along the arkansas river colorado division of water resources cdwr arkrocco rocky ford cdwr arklajco la junta usgs 07124000 las animas one gage in timpas creek usgs 07121500 one gage in crooked arroyo cdwr canswkco and one in horse creek cdwr hrc194co see fig 4 the raw gage data gathered on 15 min intervals were averaged over each weekly time step for comparing to simulated streamflow the magnitude and pattern of simulated and measured stream flows were compared visually in plots and quantitatively using the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nsce nash and sutcliffe 1970 the coefficient of efficiency e legates and mccabe 1999 the volumetric efficiency ve criss and winston 2008 and the coefficient of determination r2 these performance measures generally range from 0 to 1 with 1 indicating an ideal match between simulated and observed values however values for nsce and e can be negative for cases of poor match uncertainty due to measurement error in the gaged flow was estimated using the accuracy classifications as provided by the usgs novak 1985 fair which indicates a 95 inter percentile range difference between the 97 5th percentile and the 2 5th percentile values that corresponds to the range between 15 of the measured value for gages arkrocco arklajco 071240000 07121500 and canswkco and poor 95 inter percentile range between 20 of the measured value for hrc194co surface water runoff resulting from irrigation and precipitation rates in excess of soil infiltration capacity were calculated outside of modflow owing to numerous field scale studies within the larv that guided calibration of tailwater amounts gates et al 2012 total surface runoff was re inserted into appropriate i e topographically downgradient sfr segments for proper accounting of tailwater 4 1 2 rt3d otis calibration and testing crop parameter values and chemical reaction parameter values used in the rt3d otis model application are presented in tables s1 and s2 in supplemental information selected model input parameters for rt3d and otis were altered within a physically realistic range of values reported in the literature to obtain simulated groundwater concentrations mass loading to the arkansas river and stream concentrations that reasonably matched field values for both se and no3 these parameters are listed in table 3 and include denitrification heterotrophic and autotrophic and se chemical reduction parameters for heterotrophic reduction of no3 and seo4 rates are estimated for riparian areas and for non riparian areas due to the enhanced carbon cycling and bacterial activity that occurs in vegetation rich soil groundwater systems a recursive manual and automated calibration procedure with the latter using pest was used to obtain parameter value estimates measured groundwater and in stream se and no3 concentrations and groundwater to stream mass loadings were available during 2006 2009 providing a model calibration period defined as june 19th 2006 to march 20th 2008 and a testing period of march 21st 2008 to october 31st 2009 six different calibration targets were assessed 1 average groundwater cse in defined grouping areas see fig 5a for the 13 grouping areas 2 average groundwater c no 3 n in the grouping areas unaccounted for mass loading of 3 se and 4 no3 to the arkansas river which includes loading from groundwater discharge and from un gaged surface runoff and 5 in stream cse and 6 c no 3 n in the arkansas river and tributaries performance of the rt3d otis model in predicting cse and c no 3 n in groundwater was tested using a methodology similar to that described by bailey et al 2014 in grouping measurements of groundwater concentration in monitoring wells by canal command areas in the present study concentration measurements were grouped within areas that were defined by their proximity to 13 respective stream segments the rationale for this grouping was the assumption that chemical reactions in riparian areas control cse and c no 3 n in both the shallow aquifer and the adjacent stream reaches depth averaged simulated values of cse and c no 3 n in groundwater cells within each grouping area were compared with statistics of corresponding observed values stochastic estimates of unaccounted for se and no3 mass entering the arkansas river were used in the calibration process the approach was similar to that described for the evaluation of simulated unaccounted for groundwater return flows see section 4 1 1 results from the stochastic mass balance were available for the period october 1st 2006 to october 31st 2009 when both ec and flow data were available at the stream gages simulated mass loading over these dates were compared to statistics characterizing the estimated uncertainty in the river mass balance calculations net sinks and sources due to in stream chemical reactions were assumed negligible over the river reach in this analysis the time averaged value of the ensemble coefficient of variation cv was used as a composite measure of the level of uncertainty in se and no3 loads computed by river mass balance analysis measured in stream cse and c no 3 n were compared to simulated values for each computational stream segment that contained a sample location and for the corresponding day that the sample was collected four dates of observations within the calibration period were available for use between 6 19 2006 and 3 20 2008 and five dates within the testing period between 6 23 2008 and 7 22 2009 in total there are seven sampling locations within the arkansas river and three within selected tributaries see fig 4 for locations to estimate the uncertainty related to the discrepancy in the temporal scale an analysis was conducted of the temporal variability in the residuals of instantaneous either 15 min or 30 min intervals measurements of ec from the daily average ec value which was subsequently applied to cse and c no 3 n based on a regression relationships between ec and cse and between ec and c no 3 n developed using procedures similar to mueller price and gates 2008 the computed cv of these residuals was used to represent the uncertainty associated with temporal scale discrepancy between observed and simulated values of cse and c no 3 n the cv representing uncertainty in spatial scale discrepancy between cse and c no 3 n values measured at a point within a computational river segment and the model computed average values over the river segment was assumed to be equal to the cv computed for the temporal scale uncertainty uncertainty due to measurement error was assessed using the cvs of pairwise differences between values of cse in 40 duplicate sample sets and between values of c no 3 n in 108 duplicate sample sets from streams and groundwater a composite measure of uncertainty derived from spatiotemporal variability and measurement error was computed as the square root of the sum of the squares of the cvs casella and berger 2002 for temporal scale discrepancy spatial scale discrepancy and measurement error a combination of manual and automated calibration guided by earlier investigations and sensitivity analyses was used to adjust selected groundwater and surface water parameters to achieve an adequate match of rt3d otis simulations to the six calibration targets within the larv usr the calibration procedure is outlined in the following steps 1 chemical reaction rates within the cells that represent the riparian corridor adjacent to the arkansas river and its tributaries were selected for adjustment within uzf rt3d rates of heterotrophic chemical reduction of no3 and seo4 λ no 3 het and λ seo 4 het respectively the rate of heterotrophic reduction of seo3 to elemental se and mobile semet λ seo 3 het and the rate of heterotrophic reduction of semet λ semet het this approach was based upon previous studies that highlight the key role of heterotrophic chemical reduction in lowering the concentration of redox sensitive pollutants in riparian and hyporheic zones hill 1996 spruill 2000 vidon and hill 2004 dosskey et al 2010 ranalli and macalady 2010 bailey et al 2015 huizenga et al 2017 2 based on an initial sensitivity analysis the following parameters where chosen for adjustment in the otis model λ seo 4 λ seo 4 vol λ seo 4 assim df no 3 n and ρ mass of accessible sediment per volume of stream water 3 all parameters are initially set to values that had been previously determined by morway et al 2013 bailey et al 2014 and bailey and ahmadi 2014 due to the long simulation time required for parameters to influence chemical transport in the aquifer a long term 40 year rt3d otis simulation is run to determine the effect of the parameters on groundwater and in stream concentrations the simulation consisted of repeating hydrologic and irrigation conditions from 1999 to 2009 results were compared the different calibration period targets followed by a manual adjustment and re run of the simulation during the course of the manual calibration it was deemed necessary to add λ no 3 auto λ no 3 het λ seo 4 het λ seo 3 het λ semet het and kse within the non riparian areas to the set of parameters to be calibrated 4 pest was run using parameter values obtained from the manual calibration pest iteratively adjusts parameter values to minimize the sum of the squared weighted residuals the objective function between the simulated values and observed values of all variables associated with the six designated calibration targets during the calibration period june 19th 2006 to march 20th 2008 weights were assigned to account for differences in measurement scale and level of uncertainty among the variables the calibrated parameter values determined by pest were used in another 40 yr simulation to check for unreasonable long term drift caused by the required long period of time for altered parameter values to fully affect groundwater concentrations in simulated concentrations and loads further manual adjustment of pest calibrated parameter values was conducted to remove such long term drift 5 a further confirmation of the calibrated model was made by comparing model simulations to observed values within the test period march 21st 2008 to october 31st 2009 4 2 calibration and testing results 4 2 1 modflow sfr calibration and testing results temporal averaged values of csb in the sfr stream segments determined from manual calibration varied from 0 67 m2d 1m 1 to 23 700 m2d 1m 1 with an average value of 537 m2d 1m 1 over the stream segments in the arkansas river and from 0 005 m2d 1m 1 to 50 6 m2d 1m 1 with an average value of 9 7 m2d 1m 1 over the stream segments in the tributaries these values are comparable to those reported and used in the literature for alluvial streams hunt et al 2001 chen and shu 2002 fox 2007 modflow sfr results are shown in figs 7 9 relative frequency histograms of groundwater head residuals computed as the difference between modflow sfr simulated groundwater head and the groundwater head observed in the monitoring well situated within each corresponding cell are shown in fig 7 these residuals presented for both the calibration and testing periods indicate a good model performance in simulating groundwater head black bars depict the standard deviation inter percentile range of the residuals i e the range between the mean plus one standard deviation and the mean minus one standard deviation the red bars depict the range in uncertainty of observed head values over the spatial area of a grid cell 6 25 ha and the model time step of 1 week based on field results described in morway et al 2013 the uncertainty is estimated to be 0 53 m comparison of the red and black bars provides an indication of the fraction of the total variability in the residuals that is contributed by scale discrepancy the root mean square error rmse of the simulated values compared to the observed values was 2 23 m and 2 83 m for the calibration and testing periods respectively the average residual was 0 02 m and 0 41 m for the calibration and testing periods respectively the calibration period residuals shown in fig 7a for the modflow sfr model are very similar to those resulting from the modflow model that used the river package for the study region morway et al 2013 fig 8 shows the groundwater plus unmeasured surface return flow simulated by modflow sfr which are generally within the 95 inter percentile range estimated by stochastic river mass balance as seen in fig 8 there are several short duration spikes in the mass balance estimates that are not captured in the modflow sfr simulation these spikes could be due to rapid runoff during large precipitation events from the desert areas to the south of the irrigated areas which are not represented in the flow model markers in fig 8 show the time of precipitation events within the model domain that were estimated greater than 2 5 cm 1 in in depth these events appear to coincide with some of the spikes in the mass balance results but not all of them et from cropped cells computed by the modflow sfr model was reasonably comparable to that computed by the reset model over the same time period the average percent differences over the years 2004 2006 were 0 1 for melons which cover about 1 5 of the cropped area in the usr over the 2004 2006 period 0 2 for corn which covers about 9 5 4 for vegetables which covers about 1 12 8 for beans which cover about 5 32 6 for onions which cover about 1 38 1 for spring grain which covers about 6 and 44 3 for sorghum which covers about 12 fig 9 shows comparative time series of weekly average flow rate measured at stream gages arkrocco arklajco and 07 124 000 on the arkansas river along with simulated flow rates which represent both a weekly average and an average over the corresponding river segment containing the stream gage uncertainty due to measurement error is depicted by the 95 inter percentile range based upon the usgs accuracy rating these plots depict a generally good correspondence between simulated and observed streamflows in both magnitude and temporal variability table 2 summarizes the comparison of the model predicted flows with the gaged values using the performance measures described above results indicate a fairly good match for the arkansas river segments but a poorer match for the tributaries the poorer model performance in simulating tributary flows is due to the model assumption that inflow into the upstream end of the tributaries from outside the model domain is negligible an assumption that is necessary owing to the difficulty in estimating ungaged tributary inflow to the modeled area and due to difficulty in matching the timing and rate of return flows to tributaries 4 2 2 rt3d otis calibration and testing results parameter values resulting from the rt3d otis calibration process are summarized in tables 3 and 4 for the groundwater and surface water parameters respectively these values are within ranges reported in the literature guo et al 1999 2000 chow et al 2004 fujita et al 2005 also see cumulative distribution functions of compiled reaction rates presented in figs s1 and s2 in supplemental information results for system response variables are shown in figs 10 13 fig 10 shows simulated groundwater c seo 4 c seo 3 and c no 3 n averaged over the 2006 2009 simulation period the overall spatial average of the temporally averaged cell wise values for c seo 4 c seo 3 and c no 3 n are 46 μg l 7 μg l and 3 mg l respectively generally areas of high c seo 4 correspond to areas of high c no 3 n particularly in vicinities with high fertilizer loading e g corn see fig 5d also areas of high c seo 4 correspond to areas of high c seo 3 due to chemical reduction of seo4 to seo3 when o2 and no3 are below inhibition thresholds as shown in fig 11 comparison between average observed and simulated values for the 13 grouping areas is good for this analysis simulated c seo 4 and c seo 3 are added to determine cse whiskers on the plotted observed means represent one standard deviation of all observed values within each grouping area providing a measure of the uncertainty derived from scale discrepancy and from measurement error in light of this uncertainty simulated values are quite comparable to observations especially for cse model under prediction of c no 3 n compared to observations in some of the grouping areas may be due at least in part to the fact that the model simulated averages are biased by low values computed within the riparian zone where values are especially affected by chemical reduction whereas the observed values come from locations outside the riparian zone interestingly the values of simulated groundwater concentrations in the testing period yield a better match to observed values for both cse and c no 3 n a large incongruity is in grouping area 13 where the model output is much higher than the observed concentration in this area there are very few groundwater monitoring wells suggesting the possibility that the few available observed values are not representative of conditions in other parts of the grouping area in addition measured values may not represent adequately the actual aquifer conditions throughout an entire irrigation command area although the model captures the major trends and magnitudes of cse and c no 3 n comparisons at a point are not always good this is due to spatio temporal averaging of hydro chemical processes e g computing solute concentration across a 6 25 ha grid cell and over a 1 day period in addition matching simulated and measured values at specific points monitoring well locations in the aquifer was not the objective of the calibration process which could have been achieved with varying chemical reaction parameter values on a cell by cell basis rather the objective is to capture the regional trends in solute contamination and transport finally model input constraints such as the requirement of temporally constant parameter values also limited the ability of the model to represent changes in conditions in the system that may cause parameter value adjustments over time fig 12 shows the simulated mass loading of se and no3 in groundwater and unmeasured surface water returns to the arkansas river along with statistics of the mass loading computed from the stochastic river mass balance for a period spanning 2006 2009 includes portions of both the calibration and testing periods the mass balance results assume that net sinks and sources of se and no3 within the entire river reach are small compared to loads in surface and subsurface return flows the model predicted mass loading is generally well within one standard deviation of the distribution of mass loading predicted by stochastic mass balance for both se and no3 but less so for no3 fig 13 shows time series plots of model simulated cse and c no 3 n at seven locations along the arkansas river fig 13a g and at locations within three tributaries fig 13h j along with observed values results for both the calibration and testing periods are shown these comparisons indicate visually that the model provides an acceptable match with measured values regarding magnitude and spatiotemporal variability of stream concentrations moreover for many locations increases and decreases in concentration between consecutive simulations are matched by corresponding increases and decreases in the observed concentrations results for the tributaries fig 13h j for both cse and c no 3 n demonstrate the ability of the model to accurately simulate mass loadings from the aquifer to streams since flows in these large surface drains typically originate in large part from groundwater as such the connection between rt3d and otis within the modflow sfr modeling framework allows for reasonably accurate simulation of cse and c no 3 n mass loading from the aquifer to the stream network throughout the study region 4 3 appraisal of conditions compared to water quality standards model results were used to delineate approximate aquifer and stream zones wherein concentrations of se and no3 n are above regulatory water quality standards for se the maximum contamination level mcl established by the usepa is 50 μg l fig 14 a shows areas shaded wherein groundwater cse is greater than this level see fig 10a for actual simulated concentrations equal to approximately 20 of the study region in contrast the drinking water standard for se established by the european union council directive 98 83 ec is 10 μg l resulting in 75 of the study region not in compliance fig 14b the no3 n drinking water limit established by the usepa and eu is 10 mg l and 11 3 mg l respectively resulting in 4 and 3 of the aquifer system not in compliance fig 14c and d fig 15 compares simulated in stream concentrations against water quality standards fig 15a shows the 85th percentile value of cse averaged over the 2006 2009 simulation period plotted along the extent of the arkansas river within the usr along with the current usepa recommended chronic standard of 3 1 μg l results indicate a high degree of violation extending from 3 9 to 5 5 times the standard along the river reach simulated average values of c no 3 n fig 15b spread between values equivalent to 76 and 102 of the plotted usepa chronic standard for total n demonstrating the reason for growing concern about n pollution in the larv abrupt changes in concentrations shown in fig 15 are due to either the effects of tributary inflows to the arkansas river or high volume canal diversions causing local groundwater concentrations to significantly affect in stream concentrations 5 summary and conclusions this paper presents a spatially distributed physically based finite difference model rt3d otis which simulates the fate and transport of selenium se species in a coupled groundwater surface water system due to the influence of no3 on se speciation and transport the cycling of n and transport of n species in these systems also was considered the resulting model accounts for the major processes and mass sources sinks that govern se mobilization and reactive transport in agriculturally influenced aquifers and streams including sorption redox reactions release from marine shale soil cycling and crop uptake groundwater pumping canal seepage applied irrigation water and groundwater surface water interactions all flow rates and sources sinks are provided by an accompanying modflow model based on previous se groundwater models the aim of rt3d otis is to simulate spatiotemporal distributions of se and n species within and between an aquifer and its interconnected streams at a regional scale it is showcased in an application to a region in colorado s lower arkansas river valley an area with a long history of irrigated agriculture which faces challenges to control nonpoint source pollution to meet regulatory standards a problem facing many of the world s vital irrigated regions an extensive data set gathered over a 10 yr period along with the results of river flow and mass balance analyses provided an abundant and diverse set of targets for model calibration and confirmation the calibrated model was run to compare baseline conditions within the aquifer and stream network to drinking water and aquatic life standards spatial and temporal patterns of simulated concentrations reveal extreme violation of usepa s se standards in both the aquifer 20 of the aquifer area by usepa drinking water standards 75 by eu standards and the streams 3 9 to 5 5 times higher than usepa chronic standard moderate violation of no3 standards in the aquifer and near violation of the interim stream standard for total nitrogen n successful application to the larv suggests the utility of the model for regional assessment of se and n in application to other similar stream aquifer systems the stage is now set for employing the model to forecast comparisons of conditions under alternative bmps in the larv with baseline conditions and to guide decisions about their future implementation acknowledgements the authors greatly appreciate the cooperative assistance of more than
