12580,as an effective adsorbent prussian blue pb has been used to selectively eliminate radioactive cesium from the complex and change wastewater multiple attempts were introduced to refrain from the recovery difficulty of direct application of pb this study designed a novel strategy of tannic acid ta assisted multilayer pb immobilization on a commercial substrate for cesium adsorption as an effective binder ta fe was successfully applied to immobilize and disperse pb to increase the number of active particles the resulting composite membrane mta pb showed excellent cesium selectivity with a high k d value of 8986 ml g in geothermal water and maintained its cesium adsorption ability after 5 cycles compared with the reported pb powder the loaded pb gave full play to the adsorption performance the convenient fabrication method and effective removal of cs from complex solutions demonstrated that the mta pb has excellent potential for practical application in low wastewater concentrations graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords layer by layer assembly composite membrane cesium ions adsorption data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction owing to the rapid development of nuclear energy and the degradation of power plants radionuclide pollution poses a growing threat especially the recent decision to discharge fukushima nuclear polluted water causing potential severe environmental pollution and human health threats 1 2 compared to other radionuclides radioactive cesium 137cs has high water solubility a long half life and high energy β γ rays emission which would be spread quickly causing severe damage for an extended period 3 4 as a result many efforts have been underway in recent years to better remove cesium ions from the environment 5 6 the main difficulty lies in the extremely lower concentration of cesium than other coexisting metal cations sharing similar properties which limits the selective separation 7 considered as an effective method adsorption is primarily used for cs removal due to its relatively simple and economical process 8 11 typically a variety of adsorbents has been studied systematically such as zeolite 12 ammonium phosphomolybdate 13 14 metallic sulfides 15 16 titanosilicate 17 and metal hexacyanoferrates mhcfs 18 19 among them mhcfs are considered to be the most promising adsorbents in terms of their excellent cs selectivity and adsorption capacity with inappreciable metal dissolution 20 21 additionally mhcfs present favorable stability against gamma irradiation up to 300 kgy 22 however the nanometer size particles and high dispersibility made it complicated to recover the adsorbents at the end of the adsorption process limiting direct use and further practical application of this material 23 immobilization of mhcf in on supporting materials has been developed to manage the fine particles via different procedures and various supports which is possible to solve the recovery problem 24 26 however it may be faced with degradation of adsorption performance governed by diffusion resistance and density of active sites 26 generally mhcfs exhibit the highest efficiency in powder form thus the immobilization settled at the surface of substrates including the surface of pores is supposed to be more effective and suitable therefore in situ synthesis has been developed for surface exposure of mhcf to the environment of cesium ions 27 the method is rather simple which can be described as anchoring one precursor on the support usually metal ions are followed by the reaction of potassium hexacyanoferrate but the studies mainly focused on the supports with coordination groups or modified functional groups 28 notably in situ synthesis of mhcf is not a common approach that can fit all the pre synthesized matrices tannic acid a typical polyphenol with many catechol or pyrogallol groups could coordinate with transition metal ions such as fe3 to form a crosslinked ta fe complex film on nearly all the substrate surfaces 29 varieties of studies have confirmed the stability and versatility of the hydrophilic surface modification mainly focused on improving the anti fouling ability of membranes 30 moreover ta fe was used as an intermediate layer for further adjustment it was reported that ta fe interlayer enhanced the further formation of polyamide film for fabricating tfc polyamide membrane 31 thanks to the interlayer an increased monomer loading and ordered structure was obtained and the membrane performance improved evidently besides ta fe3 agnps deposited onto ti exhibited preferable photodynamic and antibacterial activity in which ta fe not only reduces agnps but possesses absorption abilities on ti surfaces and stabilizes agnps through coordination indicating the superior bonding behavior 32 accordingly ta fe is considered to be a suitable binder for mhcf anchoring on the surface of an arbitrary matrix herein a novel method has been developed to fabricate pb ta fe hybrid coatings pb particles were enwrapped in the ta fe assembled nanofilm in this work ta fe was conducted to effectively immobilize prussian blue pb fehcf on a commercial membrane for cesium removal the obtained composite membrane with pb ta fe hybrid coatings presented highly improved adsorption performance compared to the membrane without ta assisted batch experiments confirmed the existing ta fe promoted pb dispersion significantly contributing to the increased adsorption capacity the pb ta fe composite membranes showed high selectivity and reusability in geothermal water containing amounts of interfering ions and the data of adsorption kinetic emphasized it is a candidate for cs removal with low concentrations 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials commercially available nanofiber membrane pa pp es used as a substrate for surface modification was supplied by lvna technology co ltd tannic acid ta was purchased from aladdin co ltd k4fe cn 6 3h2o fecl3 6h2o and cscl were obtained from j k scientific ltd nh4cl hcl and naoh were bought from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd geothermal water was sampled from a bore well in tibet autonomous region the standard solutions of na k ca and cs were provided by the chinese national center for standard materials all chemicals were analytical grade and used as received without further purification 2 2 synthesis of pb ta fe composite membranes pb ta fe composite membranes mpb ta the surface functionalization of the commercial membranes m0 were synthesized through the in situ synthesis method assisted by a layer by layer assembly process the coating layer was formed as the procedure described below firstly the pristine commercial membrane was cut into pieces of 4 cm 4 cm for soaking up the coating solution typically the commercial membrane was immersed in 50 ml of mixture solution containing ta 0 20 mm and k4fe cn 6 3h2o 60 mm for 20 min after being rinsed with di water the resulting membrane was immersed in 50 ml fecl3 6h2o 60 mm solution for another 20 min followed by di water rinsing again to remove the excess solutions then the first coating layer was formed and the whole process was supposed to be a finished cycle repeat the entire cycle ten times to acquire a satisfying membrane for comparison pb composite membranes mpb were prepared according to the procedure mentioned above of mpb ta without ta added the resulting membranes were dried at 60 c for further use 2 3 characterization powder x ray diffraction xrd patterns were obtained to analyze the crystal structure using an x ray diffractometer msal xd 3 china with cu kα radiation in the 2θ scanning range of 10 80 fourier transform infrared spectra ftir were collected to identify the functional groups with a spectrometer tensor27 germany at the wavenumber ranging from 4000 to 400 cm 1 the surface morphology was observed by a scanning electron microscope sem jsm it300lv japan x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps data were measured on a thermo scientific escalab 250xi system with an al kα irradiation source at binding energies ranging from 0 to 800 ev the thermogravimetric analysis tga was performed on a perkin elmer instrument seteram labsys france under a nitrogen atmosphere at 25 800 c with a heating rate of 10 c min 2 4 adsorption experiments 2 4 1 adsorption isotherm kinetics and thermodynamics batch experiments were conducted by adding 50 mg adsorbent of membranes to 50 ml solution on a water bath shaker at a rotation speed of 150 rpm the adsorption isotherms and kinetics were investigated at 25 c while the adsorption isotherms and thermodynamics were carried out for 24 h till an equilibrium was reached adsorption isotherm was tested by changing the concentrations of cs solution 0 200 mg l the adsorption kinetics was determined by monitoring cs concentration for different times 0 1 48 h in which the initial concentration was 20 mg l and the adsorption thermodynamics was acquired by adjusting the temperature of the water bath after shaking for a particular time all the residual cs concentrations were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes the adsorption capacity q e mg g and adsorption efficiency e were calculated according to the equations below 1 q e v m c 0 c e 2 e c 0 c e c 0 100 where c 0 and c e mg l are the initial and equilibrium cs concentrations respectively v l represents the volume of the cs solution and m g is the weight of the whole composite membrane 2 4 2 effect of ph and competing ions on adsorption capacity to investigate the effect of adsorption conditions on capacity cs adsorption was conducted in a batch experiment at the liquid solid ratio v m of 1 l g the ph sensitivity of the composite membrane was measured at various ph values in the range of 2 10 using different initial cs concentrations 20 50 and 100 mg l and the effect of competing cations was determined by applying geothermal water as an adsorption solution the selectivity parameters distribution coefficients k d ml g and separation factors s f were listed as follows 3 k d c 0 c e c e 1000 v m 4 s f k d cs k d me where c 0 and c e mg l are the initial and equilibrium cs concentrations respectively v l represents the volume of the cs solution m g is the weight of the whole composite membrane and me represents the coexisted metal cations 2 5 adsorbent reusability in complicated solutions in order to evaluate the reusability of the obtained composite membranes experiments of adsorption desorption cycles were performed five times while nh4cl solution with the optimum concentration was selected as eluent adsorption experiments were the same as competing ions experiments while the desorption experiments proceeded by immersing the cs rich membrane in nh4cl solution with the optimized concentration after thoroughly washing the regenerated adsorbents were subjected to the next cycle 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization sem observed morphological features of the fiber matrix of the obtained membranes and the results are shown in fig 1 it can be seen that the fibers are randomly distributed the diameter of which is submicron proving vast contact sites for adsorption furthermore compared with the virgin substrate m0 nano sized particles are covered on the membrane surfaces after modification mpb and mpb ta leading to an increased diameter besides fig 1b shows an irregular morphology illustrating that pb is unevenly formed and agglomeration occurs during the synthesis process while for fig 1c a densely covered and relatively uniform surface was exhibited which may be attributed to the addition of ta in the soaking solution the crystal structures of membranes were determined by xrd as shown in fig 2 after in situ immobilization of pb mpb and mpb ta the same characteristic peaks appear at 2θ 17 4 24 7 35 2 39 5 43 7 50 7 53 9 and 57 2 the diffraction peaks can be assigned to 200 220 400 420 422 440 600 and 620 planes of pb crystal pdf 01 0239 respectively confirmed the formation of pb on the composite membranes 33 it is known that the intensities of diffraction peaks are significantly affected by the content of crystals in the composite consequently the slightly sharper diffraction peaks of mpb are consistent with more pb immobilizing onto the membranes the ftir spectra of the three composite membranes are also illustrated to confirm the successful formation of the pb particles as shown in fig 3a the main differences between the membranes before and after modification are the newly appeared peaks in mpb and mpb ta a strong absorption peak at 2088 cm 1 is assigned to the typical stretching vibration of the c n group the peak at 501 cm 1 is related to the vibration of fe2 cn fe3 and the weak adsorption at 604 cm 1 corresponds to the in plane bending vibration of fe cn 34 magnified spectra fig 3b display the distinguishing features of adding ta which are the different peaks near 1714 and 1015 cm 1 of mpb ta corresponding to co and c o c tensile vibrations 20 21 the contents of pb immobilized on the composite membranes were investigated by tga analysis and the results are presented in fig 4 for the substrate membrane m0 it is decomposed completely upon heating to 800 c with no residual material left while pb powder is entirely decomposed at 385 c with no further weight loss till 800 c and the residual content is about 51 on this basis the residual material of mpb is owing to the immobilized pb from the 16 remaining weight it can be deduced that the loading percent of pb is about 33 in the case of mpb ta the residual weight of 6 represents 12 pb formed because of the presence of ta the tga analysis confirmed that the addition of ta led to fewer formed pb consistent with the result of xrd xps analysis was further used to reveal the elemental composition and the chemical status of pb in the different membranes as fig 6a shows the peaks at 709 08 ev and 294 08 ev are characteristic peaks of fe 2p and k 2p and the peaks at 287 08 ev 400 08 ev and 532 08 ev are consistent with c 1s n 1s and o 1s respectively it can be seen that fe and k appeared both in mpb and mpb ta illustrating the pb loading successfully as depicted in fig 5b the fe 2p spectra of mpb clearly show that fe is located at two main peaks of 708 52 ev and 721 37 ev representing feii 2p3 2 and feii 2p1 2 states the other two weak peaks at 709 3 ev and 723 55 ev are related to feiii 2p3 2 and feiii 2p1 2 states respectively considering the binding energy of feiii 2p1 2 and feiii 2p3 2 a shift to lower binding energy for mpb ta was observed together with a shift to the higher binding energy of feii 2p1 2 and feiii 2p3 2 this may be attributed to the coordination reaction that the complexation of the phenolic hydroxyl group in ta with fe3 increases the electron cloud density around fe3 decreasing the binding energy in contrast the complexation of oh with fe3 weakens the electron donor capacity of cn thus reducing the electron cloud density around fe2 and increasing the binding energy all the observed shifts prove that ta and fe3 in pb are successfully bonded through chemical bonds 35 3 2 adsorption performance evaluation 3 2 1 effect of ta on the adsorption performance ta has a favorable adhesion on various substrates and can easily react with fe3 and the generated ta fe is considered to play the role of connector and dispersant in this study therefore it is believed that the ta concentration greatly influences the adsorption properties of composite membranes in this case the composite membranes with different ta fecl3 k4 fe cn 6 molar ratios were prepared batch experiments were carried out to evaluate the cesium adsorption performance and the results are shown in table 1 where a molar ratio of 0 6 6 represents mpb without ta it can be seen that mpb ta displayed superior adsorption capacities than mpb and the mpb ta with precursors mole ratio of 1 6 6 exhibited the best the increased adsorption capacity with the addition of ta may be attributed to the well dispersed pb which confirmed what we suspected while increasing the addition of ta might lead to decreased pb formation the molar ratio was controlled at 1 6 6 in the following sections 3 2 2 effect of adsorption conditions the effects of adsorption conditions on the adsorption performance of mta pb were investigated ph temperature initial concentration and contact time included fig 6a showed that the adsorption efficiency for 15 mg l of cs was higher than the other two test concentrations over the whole ph range which is due to the fact that the specific adsorbent amount cannot afford sufficient adsorption sites for higher cs concentrations from a view of tendency the adsorption efficiency increased with the increase of ph this is mainly because at low ph 2 6 competitive adsorption occurred between h and cs making less availability for cs removal when the ph increased continuously the adsorption efficiency became obviously increased owing to the deprotonation of ta providing more available reaction sites 36 however it was observed the pb slightly exfoliated at ph 12 during the experiments while there were no changes at ph below 10 the results indicated that mta pb exhibited excellent stability and cs removal ability at weakly alkaline conditions suggesting a potential candidate using in alkali wastewater fig 6b exhibited the effect of various temperatures on the adsorption efficiency at different initial concentrations for example with the increase in temperature from 298 15 k to 328 15 k the adsorption rates increased slightly indicating that a higher temperature is conducive to cs adsorption fig 6c showed that the adsorption performance increased with the increase of initial cs concentrations varying from 10 to 250 mg l it was found that the adsorption capacity increased rapidly at the initial concentrations of 60 mg l and then raised slowly with the initial concentration of 60 250 mg l the abundant cs adsorption sites and higher driving force for mass transfer at lower initial concentrations can explain this in contrast the occupied sites confirmed the decreased removal rate at the higher initial concentrations 37 fig 6d gave the effect of contact time on the adsorption performance of mta pb from a view of tendency the adsorption rate sharply increased in the first 2 h and over 81 of cs was removed the rapid adsorption rate in the initial stage might be ascribed to the supply of numerous active sites then the decreasing active sites were available with the ongoing adsorption process 3 2 3 adsorption isotherms in order to acquire more information about the cs affinity of mpb ta the langmuir and freundlich models were used to describe the relationship between the adsorbed cs and equilibrium concentration the non linear equations were listed as follows 5 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e 6 q e k f c e 1 n where q e and q m mg g are the equilibrium and maximum adsorption capacity respectively c e mg l is the equilibrium cs concentration b is the langmuir coefficient k l refers to the langmuir parameter related to the energy of adsorption k f and 1 n represent the freundlich constants indicating the adsorption capacity and intensity after fitting the calculated equilibrium data to the two models the isotherm curves are shown in fig 7 and the related parameters are shown in table 2 according to the higher correlation coefficient r 2 the langmuir model was more suitable for cs adsorption than the freundlich model indicating that it was performed as monolayer adsorption with non interacting molecules the maximum adsorption capacity is 34 82 mg g calculated by the mass of mpb ta additionally the separation factor r l was calculated at 0 061 between 0 and 1 indicating that cs has a good affinity with the adsorbent 38 3 2 4 adsorption kinetics the kinetic studies provided more information about the adsorption mechanism of rate controlling steps for this purpose pseudo first order and pseudo second order models were employed to fit the experimental data the equations of the two non linear models can be expressed as 7 q t q e 1 e k 1 t 8 q t q e 2 k 2 t 1 q e k 2 t where q e and q t mg g represent the removal capacity at equilibrium and a specific time t k 1 min 1 and k 2 min 1 are the rate constants of pseudo first order and pseudo second order models respectively the fitted curves of kinetics models are demonstrated in fig 8 and the corresponding parameters are exhibited in table 3 it was found that the correlation coefficient of the pseudo second order was closer to 1 indicating that the adsorption process is mainly affected by the chemisorption process the result is consistent with the previously reported removal of cs by pb based adsorbents 39 3 2 5 adsorption thermodynamics as a function of 1000 t lnk d was fitted to a van t hoff linear equation and plotted in fig 9 from which the thermodynamic parameters can be obtained including enthalpy δh 0 kj mol 1 entropy δs 0 j mol 1 k 1 and gibbs free energy δg 0 kj mol 1 the related equations are listed below 9 ln k d δ s 0 r δ h 0 rt 10 δ g 0 δ h 0 tδ s 0 where k d refers to the equilibrium distribution coefficient t k is the temperature and r represents the gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 the calculated values of δh 0 and δs 0 are positive while the value of δg 0 is negative suggesting that the process of cesium adsorption was endothermic random and spontaneous table 4 additionally the absolute value of δg 0 increased with an increase in temperature in this case a higher temperature is favorable for the cesium removal by the composite membrane 3 3 selectivity and reusability in complicated solutions 3 3 1 effects of competing ions on adsorption the selective adsorption was affected by the species and quantity of coexisted metal ions especially alkali metal ions 40 a complicated solution of geothermal water was applied to investigate the influence of interfering ions on cs adsorption and the relevant parameters of the main competing ions are listed in table 5 it can be seen that although the concentrations of competitive ions are much higher than cs the distribution coefficient k d of cs reached up to 8985 56 ml g and the separation factor for na is much higher than the previously reported 9 10 most importantly the adsorption efficiency could reach over 89 even at such high concentrations and complicated solutions indicating excellent selectivity of mta pb for cesium removal furthermore as the used geothermal water is alkaline the affinity of cs with deprotonated hydroxyl may facilitate the sieving of hydrated ions by pb inner channels close to 3 2 å resulting in good selectivity of mta pb 3 3 2 desorption and regeneration the regeneration experiments were carried out to evaluate the reusability of mpb ta in practical application first nh4cl solutions with different concentrations were selected as eluent and re absorption studies were conducted the results are shown in fig 10 it was found that both the desorption and re adsorption efficiencies increased distinctly with the increase of nh4cl reaching a maximum of 1 mol l fig 10a when the concentration of nh4cl continued to grow the efficiencies decreased instead consequently nh4cl solution of 1 mol l was used for the recycling experiments as shown in fig 10b the adsorption efficiency and capacity decreased negligibly for 5 cycles suggesting the remarkable reusability of mpb ta which is beneficial for practical use 3 4 comparison with other prussian blue composite membranes table 6 compares the cesium removal abilities of different prussian blue analogues composite membranes the results show that ta fe in the mpb ta can promote the dispersion of pb and effectively prevent the agglomeration phenomenon so the maximum adsorption capacity is higher and the equilibrium time 3 h is shorter than most of the other adsorption membranes which is conducive to the removal of cs in practical application moreover mpb ta shows good adsorption selectivity and the distribution coefficient even for geothermal water 8985 56 ml g is comparable to that of the pb pan membrane 4 conclusion in this study a novel strategy has been conducted to fabricate a composite adsorption membrane with prussian blue for cesium removal as an effective binder ta fe was successfully used to immobilize prussian blue on a commercial membrane the structure and composition characteristic of the obtained composite membrane mta pb displayed less pb loading but highly improved adsorption performance due to the promoted pb dispersion batch adsorption experiments confirmed the effective cesium removal especially in low concentrations furthermore the composite membrane presented good cs adsorption performance at alkaline conditions excellent selectivity and reusability even in complex geothermal water suggesting that it is a promising strategy for fabricating

consistent with more pb immobilizing onto the membranes the ftir spectra of the three composite membranes are also illustrated to confirm the successful formation of the pb particles as shown in fig 3a the main differences between the membranes before and after modification are the newly appeared peaks in mpb and mpb ta a strong absorption peak at 2088 cm 1 is assigned to the typical stretching vibration of the c n group the peak at 501 cm 1 is related to the vibration of fe2 cn fe3 and the weak adsorption at 604 cm 1 corresponds to the in plane bending vibration of fe cn 34 magnified spectra fig 3b display the distinguishing features of adding ta which are the different peaks near 1714 and 1015 cm 1 of mpb ta corresponding to co and c o c tensile vibrations 20 21 the contents of pb immobilized on the composite membranes were investigated by tga analysis and the results are presented in fig 4 for the substrate membrane m0 it is decomposed completely upon heating to 800 c with no residual material left while pb powder is entirely decomposed at 385 c with no further weight loss till 800 c and the residual content is about 51 on this basis the residual material of mpb is owing to the immobilized pb from the 16 remaining weight it can be deduced that the loading percent of pb is about 33 in the case of mpb ta the residual weight of 6 represents 12 pb formed because of the presence of ta the tga analysis confirmed that the addition of ta led to fewer formed pb consistent with the result of xrd xps analysis was further used to reveal the elemental composition and the chemical status of pb in the different membranes as fig 6a shows the peaks at 709 08 ev and 294 08 ev are characteristic peaks of fe 2p and k 2p and the peaks at 287 08 ev 400 08 ev and 532 08 ev are consistent with c 1s n 1s and o 1s respectively it can be seen that fe and k appeared both in mpb and mpb ta illustrating the pb loading successfully as depicted in fig 5b the fe 2p spectra of mpb clearly show that fe is located at two main peaks of 708 52 ev and 721 37 ev representing feii 2p3 2 and feii 2p1 2 states the other two weak peaks at 709 3 ev and 723 55 ev are related to feiii 2p3 2 and feiii 2p1 2 states respectively considering the binding energy of feiii 2p1 2 and feiii 2p3 2 a shift to lower binding energy for mpb ta was observed together with a shift to the higher binding energy of feii 2p1 2 and feiii 2p3 2 this may be attributed to the coordination reaction that the complexation of the phenolic hydroxyl group in ta with fe3 increases the electron cloud density around fe3 decreasing the binding energy in contrast the complexation of oh with fe3 weakens the electron donor capacity of cn thus reducing the electron cloud density around fe2 and increasing the binding energy all the observed shifts prove that ta and fe3 in pb are successfully bonded through chemical bonds 35 3 2 adsorption performance evaluation 3 2 1 effect of ta on the adsorption performance ta has a favorable adhesion on various substrates and can easily react with fe3 and the generated ta fe is considered to play the role of connector and dispersant in this study therefore it is believed that the ta concentration greatly influences the adsorption properties of composite membranes in this case the composite membranes with different ta fecl3 k4 fe cn 6 molar ratios were prepared batch experiments were carried out to evaluate the cesium adsorption performance and the results are shown in table 1 where a molar ratio of 0 6 6 represents mpb without ta it can be seen that mpb ta displayed superior adsorption capacities than mpb and the mpb ta with precursors mole ratio of 1 6 6 exhibited the best the increased adsorption capacity with the addition of ta may be attributed to the well dispersed pb which confirmed what we suspected while increasing the addition of ta might lead to decreased pb formation the molar ratio was controlled at 1 6 6 in the following sections 3 2 2 effect of adsorption conditions the effects of adsorption conditions on the adsorption performance of mta pb were investigated ph temperature initial concentration and contact time included fig 6a showed that the adsorption efficiency for 15 mg l of cs was higher than the other two test concentrations over the whole ph range which is due to the fact that the specific adsorbent amount cannot afford sufficient adsorption sites for higher cs concentrations from a view of tendency the adsorption efficiency increased with the increase of ph this is mainly because at low ph 2 6 competitive adsorption occurred between h and cs making less availability for cs removal when the ph increased continuously the adsorption efficiency became obviously increased owing to the deprotonation of ta providing more available reaction sites 36 however it was observed the pb slightly exfoliated at ph 12 during the experiments while there were no changes at ph below 10 the results indicated that mta pb exhibited excellent stability and cs removal ability at weakly alkaline conditions suggesting a potential candidate using in alkali wastewater fig 6b exhibited the effect of various temperatures on the adsorption efficiency at different initial concentrations for example with the increase in temperature from 298 15 k to 328 15 k the adsorption rates increased slightly indicating that a higher temperature is conducive to cs adsorption fig 6c showed that the adsorption performance increased with the increase of initial cs concentrations varying from 10 to 250 mg l it was found that the adsorption capacity increased rapidly at the initial concentrations of 60 mg l and then raised slowly with the initial concentration of 60 250 mg l the abundant cs adsorption sites and higher driving force for mass transfer at lower initial concentrations can explain this in contrast the occupied sites confirmed the decreased removal rate at the higher initial concentrations 37 fig 6d gave the effect of contact time on the adsorption performance of mta pb from a view of tendency the adsorption rate sharply increased in the first 2 h and over 81 of cs was removed the rapid adsorption rate in the initial stage might be ascribed to the supply of numerous active sites then the decreasing active sites were available with the ongoing adsorption process 3 2 3 adsorption isotherms in order to acquire more information about the cs affinity of mpb ta the langmuir and freundlich models were used to describe the relationship between the adsorbed cs and equilibrium concentration the non linear equations were listed as follows 5 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e 6 q e k f c e 1 n where q e and q m mg g are the equilibrium and maximum adsorption capacity respectively c e mg l is the equilibrium cs concentration b is the langmuir coefficient k l refers to the langmuir parameter related to the energy of adsorption k f and 1 n represent the freundlich constants indicating the adsorption capacity and intensity after fitting the calculated equilibrium data to the two models the isotherm curves are shown in fig 7 and the related parameters are shown in table 2 according to the higher correlation coefficient r 2 the langmuir model was more suitable for cs adsorption than the freundlich model indicating that it was performed as monolayer adsorption with non interacting molecules the maximum adsorption capacity is 34 82 mg g calculated by the mass of mpb ta additionally the separation factor r l was calculated at 0 061 between 0 and 1 indicating that cs has a good affinity with the adsorbent 38 3 2 4 adsorption kinetics the kinetic studies provided more information about the adsorption mechanism of rate controlling steps for this purpose pseudo first order and pseudo second order models were employed to fit the experimental data the equations of the two non linear models can be expressed as 7 q t q e 1 e k 1 t 8 q t q e 2 k 2 t 1 q e k 2 t where q e and q t mg g represent the removal capacity at equilibrium and a specific time t k 1 min 1 and k 2 min 1 are the rate constants of pseudo first order and pseudo second order models respectively the fitted curves of kinetics models are demonstrated in fig 8 and the corresponding parameters are exhibited in table 3 it was found that the correlation coefficient of the pseudo second order was closer to 1 indicating that the adsorption process is mainly affected by the chemisorption process the result is consistent with the previously reported removal of cs by pb based adsorbents 39 3 2 5 adsorption thermodynamics as a function of 1000 t lnk d was fitted to a van t hoff linear equation and plotted in fig 9 from which the thermodynamic parameters can be obtained including enthalpy δh 0 kj mol 1 entropy δs 0 j mol 1 k 1 and gibbs free energy δg 0 kj mol 1 the related equations are listed below 9 ln k d δ s 0 r δ h 0 rt 10 δ g 0 δ h 0 tδ s 0 where k d refers to the equilibrium distribution coefficient t k is the temperature and r represents the gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 the calculated values of δh 0 and δs 0 are positive while the value of δg 0 is negative suggesting that the process of cesium adsorption was endothermic random and spontaneous table 4 additionally the absolute value of δg 0 increased with an increase in temperature in this case a higher temperature is favorable for the cesium removal by the composite membrane 3 3 selectivity and reusability in complicated solutions 3 3 1 effects of competing ions on adsorption the selective adsorption was affected by the species and quantity of coexisted metal ions especially alkali metal ions 40 a complicated solution of geothermal water was applied to investigate the influence of interfering ions on cs adsorption and the relevant parameters of the main competing ions are listed in table 5 it can be seen that although the concentrations of competitive ions are much higher than cs the distribution coefficient k d of cs reached up to 8985 56 ml g and the separation factor for na is much higher than the previously reported 9 10 most importantly the adsorption efficiency could reach over 89 even at such high concentrations and complicated solutions indicating excellent selectivity of mta pb for cesium removal furthermore as the used geothermal water is alkaline the affinity of cs with deprotonated hydroxyl may facilitate the sieving of hydrated ions by pb inner channels close to 3 2 å resulting in good selectivity of mta pb 3 3 2 desorption and regeneration the regeneration experiments were carried out to evaluate the reusability of mpb ta in practical application first nh4cl solutions with different concentrations were selected as eluent and re absorption studies were conducted the results are shown in fig 10 it was found that both the desorption and re adsorption efficiencies increased distinctly with the increase of nh4cl reaching a maximum of 1 mol l fig 10a when the concentration of nh4cl continued to grow the efficiencies decreased instead consequently nh4cl solution of 1 mol l was used for the recycling experiments as shown in fig 10b the adsorption efficiency and capacity decreased negligibly for 5 cycles suggesting the remarkable reusability of mpb ta which is beneficial for practical use 3 4 comparison with other prussian blue composite membranes table 6 compares the cesium removal abilities of different prussian blue analogues composite membranes the results show that ta fe in the mpb ta can promote the dispersion of pb and effectively prevent the agglomeration phenomenon so the maximum adsorption capacity is higher and the equilibrium time 3 h is shorter than most of the other adsorption membranes which is conducive to the removal of cs in practical application moreover mpb ta shows good adsorption selectivity and the distribution coefficient even for geothermal water 8985 56 ml g is comparable to that of the pb pan membrane 4 conclusion in this study a novel strategy has been conducted to fabricate a composite adsorption membrane with prussian blue for cesium removal as an effective binder ta fe was successfully used to immobilize prussian blue on a commercial membrane the structure and composition characteristic of the obtained composite membrane mta pb displayed less pb loading but highly improved adsorption performance due to the promoted pb dispersion batch adsorption experiments confirmed the effective cesium removal especially in low concentrations furthermore the composite membrane presented good cs adsorption performance at alkaline conditions excellent selectivity and reusability even in complex geothermal water suggesting that it is a promising strategy for fabricating

12581,active pharmaceutical ingredients apis are continuously released via hospital effluents and have been shown to be toxic to aquatic organisms even at very low concentrations future risks to human health might also emerge due to accumulation of these compounds in food chains through contamination of water supplies and propagation of antimicrobial resistance amr the ongoing global rise in drug prescribing rates is increasing api concentrations in aquatic environments current wastewater treatment plants wwtps are ineffective at removing many of these compounds pilot scale advanced oxidation processes aops at wwtps such as uv irradiation or ozone are not considered sustainable at the industrial scale due to their high operating cost and the potential for formation of toxic by products by contrast photocatalytic aops only require light induced activation of a reusable photocatalyst to eliminate the most persistent apis despite their sustainable characteristics photocatalytic aops have rarely been assessed for suitability in flow environments such as hospital wastewater this review highlights the advantages of photocatalytic aop based wastewater treatment compared to existing aops it also explores the immobilisation of effective photocatalytic metallic nanomaterials onto carbon based porous support structures as a future proof treatment concept for the elimination of apis from hospital wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords hospital wastewater treatment active pharmaceutical ingredients aquatic toxicity photocatalytic metallic nanomaterials porous support materials data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction organic micropollutants of anthropogenic origin such as pesticides and pharmaceuticals have been detected in surface water rivers lakes groundwater and drinking water worldwide 1 3 apis have attracted attention as priority substances of emerging concern given their potential to cause detrimental toxic effects on biota even at trace μg l 1 or ultra trace ng l 1 concentrations in the aquatic environment 4 6 over the last 40 years drug residues and their metabolites in wastewater effluents have been shown to cause acute and chronic adverse effects in aquatic organisms such as behavioural changes in fish exposed to antidepressants or feminisation of species exposed to the synthetic birth control hormone ethinylestradiol ee2 6 8 in addition antibiotics in wastewater are contributing to the ongoing and dramatic spread of antimicrobial resistance amr in microbial populations 9 12 the harmful effects of apis in the aquatic environment raise concerns regarding human health given their presence in receiving water and their inadequate removal by conventional wastewater treatment 6 in turn this may result in low level api occurrence in water supplies and or potential accumulation in food chains 13 although the ecotoxicity of some apis has been investigated in detail most of the 4000 apis licenced for disease treatment worldwide are still poorly classified in terms of their ecotoxicity or not monitored by national water quality regulatory bodies 14 17 wastewater originating specifically from hospitals contains a wide variety of apis and metabolites associated with patient urine and faeces 18 19 table 1 3 20 25 hospitals have been identified as key point sources for environmental api pollution due to their substantial water consumption 200 1200 l bed day continuous api release in hospital effluent and subsequent pollution of receiving waters 6 7 these hospital derived api mixtures with potentially enhanced ecotoxicity due to synergistic toxicity are commonly mixed with and diluted by domestic and industrial wastewater in communal sewers prior to wastewater treatment 6 26 27 most industrialised countries still use conventional activated sludge cas systems to treat their wastewater from hospitals households and industry however cas systems were never designed to remove the multitude of often persistent apis now discharged into wwtps they are primarily designed to remove readily degradable organic matter from wastewater to meet quality standards for surface water discharge i e set by the eu water framework directive and to prevent the spread of infectious microorganisms 17 21 28 the combined environmental impact of hospital derived apis the global rise in drug prescribing rates the increasing threat posed by amr and the continuous release of toxic chlorination by products from conventional wastewater treatment signals that global action is urgently needed to develop novel and more sustainable wastewater treatment solutions 6 11 29 30 this review explores the use of light driven photocatalytic api removal via advanced oxidation processes aops and its potential within flow environments such as hospital wastewater existing biological physico chemical and pilot scale aops for wastewater treatment are discussed and compared to novel photocatalytic approaches to evaluate api elimination efficiency from hospital wastewater and to provide an outlook on sustainability and affordability this review is the first to provide a comprehensive perspective on both conventional and novel photocatalytic nanomaterials and their immobilisation within a diverse range of organic support structures there is a particular focus on novel graphene based carbon nanostructures that offer unique characteristics in this regard 31 research considering flow through concepts for continuous photocatalytic wastewater treatment is still scarce in existing literature evaluating these novel approaches is essential for future research aimed at developing large scale photocatalytic solutions to enable at source elimination of apis from hospital effluents 2 biological wastewater treatment cas systems are the most common biological treatment techniques used in communal wwtps worldwide large scale cas systems utilising aerated sludge basins to oxidise and eliminate dissolved organic carbon doc using suspended aerobic and anaerobic microbes widely produce water quality that meets national discharge quality standards however quality standards are becoming stricter and starting to consider a wider range of potentially harmful compounds cas systems in isolation have limited elimination efficiency for many apis especially those that are recalcitrant to oxidative biodegradation such as diclofenac or carbamazepine 32 subsequent tertiary chemical oxidation processes such as hydrogen peroxide enhanced uv irradiation or ozonation are able to oxidise and eliminate apis via reactive oxygen species ros such as hydroxyl radicals but these processes are costly consume high amounts of energy and can produce toxic oxidation by products 33 promising alternatives to cas treatment include membrane biological reactors mbrs which have been piloted as a potential replacement for cas in several countries 34 mbrs have improved removal rates for doc nutrients and apis with high biodegradability e g paracetamol due to extended sludge retention and microorganism residence times and generation of smaller sludge flocs which may alter physical api removal through increased sorption onto sludge particles 35 37 in addition mbrs utilise ultra or nano filtration membranes pore size 0 03 0 06 μm following the activated sludge process to retain micropollutants 38 mbrs have been found to provide higher removal rates for antibiotics compared to cas and membrane filters can effectively retain antibiotic resistant bacteria preventing their dissemination into the environment in turn this diminishes the potential for horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistant genes across diverse microbial populations 38 39 however decentralised mbr treatment of hospital wastewater specifically with extended microorganism retention times may act to promote resistant gene evolution due to the more concentrated loads of antibiotics in hospital wastewater 29 enhanced removal rates for apis using mbr treatment have been shown for a diverse range of drug compounds particularly for those that are highly biodegradable nevertheless many apis are still detectable in mbr permeates after membrane filtration 6 33 40 mbr treatment features notable improvements over cas including a reduction in the need to use disinfecting chemicals due to the physical removal of pathogens substantial removal of multiple apis and the production of a clear effluent which does not require additional clarification such as sludge liquid separation 34 however the cost of mbr set up operation is much higher than cas due to additional sludge pumping needs membrane air scouring and the requirement to regularly replace clogged membranes 34 38 41 also some persistent apis remain recalcitrant to biodegradation using mbr and are thus poorly removed 6 3 tertiary wastewater treatment multiple studies have investigated the application of mbrs in combination with a diverse range of tertiary physico chemical treatment approaches designed to improve the elimination of api concentrations from hospital wastewater 40 42 43 amongst these studies several hospitals have been equipped with on site wastewater treatment mostly mbrs in combination with subsequent physico chemical techniques with the aim of targeting persistent apis recalcitrant to conventional secondary treatment such pilots have successfully demonstrated that a combination of treatment approaches enhances the elimination of a diverse range of apis when compared to a single solution approach 44 however each tertiary treatment process holds considerable disadvantages particularly with respect to enhanced operating costs and sustainability limitations due to regular requirements to replace or regenerate system components such as activated carbon overall a combination of mbr as a secondary treatment technique followed by advanced oxidation such as h2o2 enhanced uv irradiation or h2o2 enhanced ozonation and subsequent filtration by powdered activated carbon were identified as the most effective solutions for sustainable elimination of apis from hospital wastewater 33 45 46 advanced oxidation processes have emerged as promising wastewater treatment techniques for degrading organic pollutants such as apis via ros synthesis hydroxyl radicals oh are the most reactive oxidisers amongst radical species with a redox potential between 1 95 ev ph 14 2 8 ev ph 0 and a reaction rate constant between 108 and 1010 m 1 s 1 47 oh can rapidly and non selectively inactivate harmful apis by reacting with the aromatic ring structures of the drug molecule 48 however due to the extremely short half life of oh most aops only work sustainably with continuous supplementation with oxidising agents such as h2o2 or o3 alternatively irradiation with light in combination with a reusable conductive nanomaterial can generate ros such as in heterogenous photocatalysis 47 h 2 o 2 enhanced uv irradiation is the most popular aop in large scale tertiary wastewater treatment due to its advantages over stand alone uv light induced photolysis to enhance elimination of organic material this is achieved through light induced formation of oh from h2o2 which non selectively oxidises organic compounds such as apis 44 49 50 a pilot study within the eu pharmaceutical input and elimination from local sources pills project revealed that h2o2 treatment in combination with uv light exposure of mbr pre treated wastewater substantially increased api elimination rates however high electrical energy costs and h2o2 dosage requirements were incurred the study further showed that under pure uv irradiation without h2o2 86 of investigated pharmaceuticals including persistent compounds like diclofenac and carbamazepine could be eliminated by photolysis again the energy requirements for this process were substantial 10 kwh m 3 under h2o2 treatment 94 of the most non persistent compounds could be oxidised requiring only half as much energy successful elimination of persistent compounds i e 67 removal of carbamazepine vs only 10 removal after mbr treatment could be achieved under moderate uv light exposure 2 kwh m 3 but required more uv light exposure time and higher h2o2 consumption overall h2o2 enhanced uv light applications inevitably require considerable amounts of electrical energy 49 also key wastewater matrix characteristics e g turbidity suspended solids may negatively influence light penetration and impact photolytic api degradation in addition alkaline wastewater may contain bicarbonate ions which can scavenge oh and further impact overall api oxidation efficiency 51 52 h 2 o 2 enhanced ozonation is a highly effective technique to eliminate a diverse range of organic compounds ozone generates oh during its decay and in the presence of h2o2 the decomposition of ozone is catalysed accelerating the generation of oh consequently h2o2 enhanced ozonation oxidises most organic micropollutants even recalcitrant apis efficiently another effective but extremely energy demanding process is the combination of uv irradiation and aqueous ozone known as photoinduced ozonation which generates h2o2 initiating ozone decay and the production of oh 51 at a hospital wastewater pilot scale treatment plant in switzerland where mbr was used for secondary treatment several post treatment technologies were tested with ozonation successfully delivering removal rates of 97 for all tested apis including carbamazepine diclofenac ciprofloxacin clarithromycin sulfamethoxazole and ranitidine overall api removal efficiency was 90 using ozonation 86 using powdered activated carbon while uv irradiation only eliminated 33 of apis in this setting 50 ozone is a potent oxidiser for a broad spectrum of apis at very low aqueous concentrations it generally requires lower energy consumption when compared to uv irradiation during continuous application however ozone production is also a very wasteful process as most of the energy required is lost as unused heat the production of 1 kg o3 from o2 requires 12 kwh of electrical energy 44 wastewater matrix effects such as suspended solids only have a limited impact on ozone promoted api oxidation rates 53 however ph may significantly influence ozone decay and compound elimination 54 this pilot study 55 showed that drastically decreased ozone decomposition rates were seen at lower ph at ph 7 75 the time taken to fully decompose 10 mg l 1 of ozone was 1 min while at ph 5 it was 10 min this suggests that ozonation in more acidic wastewater below ph 7 75 may not eliminate all pollutants effectively the main drawback of ozone dependent processes in wastewater treatment is high energy consumption albeit lower than for uv irradiation and a dependence on specific water characteristics such as ph this parameter may vary significantly in wastewater and be affected by diurnal seasonal differences in water consumption and effluent composition at hospitals the removal of ozone to prevent atmospheric pollution also requires final effluent filtration with for example activated carbon this adds additional costs to the treatment process ozonation will non selectively oxidise organic matter and eliminate many toxic api molecules however little research has been undertaken to determine the toxicity of the resulting oxidised transformation products and most are ostensibly unknown 56 a multitude of toxic by products can also be produced during ozone exposure such as carcinogenic substances like bromates or n nitrosodimethylamines ndmas 50 57 fig 1 summarises currently available conventional and advanced wastewater treatment techniques states their suitability for the elimination of apis and their potential to introduce toxic transformation by products into the environment 4 photocatalytic wastewater treatment photocatalysis has recently emerged as a novel and sustainable alternative for future wastewater treatment photocatalysis involves light activation of a reusable conductive metallic nanomaterial 58 compared to conventional aops such as ozone or pure uv light treatment photocatalysis is thought to be free of toxic by products in addition the use of sunlight as the uv source solar disinfection sodis has been found to be a viable eco friendly means of disinfecting drinking water however the present drawback of photocatalysis is the extensive treatment time needed to achieve acceptable target compound removal rates 59 therefore both future photocatalytic materials and plant designs need to be optimised in order to increase photocatalytic efficiencies 60 heterogenous photocatalytic treatment settings which use high energy uv light combined with reusable metallic nanomaterials have been shown to degrade even persistent apis 61 the use of co catalysts such as noble metals or porous metal organic frameworks mofs in combination with uv light effective photocatalysts may substantially reduce treatment times furthermore immobilisation of photocatalysts onto porous carbonaceous support structures with superior mechanical stability could become a valuable approach in a flow through treatment setting i e for hospital wastewater 4 1 homogenous photocatalysis photo fenton is a light driven water treatment process which is effective at uv vis wavelengths up to 600 nm large scale open systems effectively sunlight based systems can make use of 28 35 of total solar energy 62 the photo fenton process is however dependent on supplementation with fenton s reagent a solution of h2o2 and ferrous iron fe2 salts such as feso4 the reaction of h2o2 and fe2 generates oh and ferric iron fe3 species conversely aqueous fe3 can react photochemically to recycle fe2 under illumination overall the photo fenton process generates ros autocatalytically under uv vis irradiation and absorbs light over a relatively wide wavelength spectrum it has significant potential for api removal as the oh production rate is high until the h2o2 is fully depleted furthermore limited toxic by products are formed during photo fenton compared to other aops ferric iron salts are environmentally benign if released in moderate amounts and excess h2o2 is consumed during the fenton reaction 51 however at large scale continuous supplementation with fenton s reagent is expensive 38 and excess release of fe3 into the environment may be harmful 63 furthermore an excess of h2o2 or fe2 can cause oh trapping therefore optimal dosing of fenton s reagent is essential to allow eco friendly wastewater treatment that yields a high pollutant elimination rate other factors that limit full scale application include the need for frequent ph adjustment photo fenton chemistry is most efficient under acidic conditions ph 3 to prevent precipitation of stable ferric salts in addition since photocatalytic recycling of fe2 is slow fe3 may form stable complexes with other organic compounds such as carboxylic acids which would block the photocatalytic cycle i e the regeneration of ferrous iron 51 4 2 heterogenous photocatalysis novel aops for tertiary wastewater treatment exclusively driven by light irradiation show promise to disinfect wastewater and eliminate organic micropollutants such as apis without adding harsh chemical oxidisers or producing toxic by products such systems could be nature based and use renewable energy e g sunlight in a wastewater treatment setting 64 65 light activated aops can generate oh under aqueous conditions in the presence of uv or visible light oxygen and a reusable photocatalyst such as a metal oxide semiconductor mos this process of light activated oh production is known as heterogenous photocatalysis 66 in solid materials a specific band gap between the electronic valence and conduction bands of single atoms defines the material s capability to allow a flow of electrons from the valence to the conduction bands ultimately specifying its conductivity under an external energy source e g light irradiation electrons of semiconductor materials which have a relatively narrow band gap can be excited from valence to conduction bands leaving behind unfilled positively charged holes hvb while filling conduction bands with an electronic negative charge ecb mos surfaces often in the form of large area nanomaterial coatings immersed in an electrolyte e g water can generate charged holes hvb and electrons ecb at the electrolyte interface between the charged metallic surface and the aqueous phase both hvb and ecb can then promote redox reactions on the metallic surface under oxygenated aqueous conditions these redox reactions ultimately generate mainly oh but also reaction intermediates such as superoxide o2 hydrogen superoxide ho2 and h2o2 all of which can oxidise and destroy pollutants such as apis which come into contact with the semiconductor surface 51 60 fig 2 describes the underlying redox reaction principle and photocatalytic mechanism on a semiconductor surface 4 3 redox reactions in photocatalytic water treatment hole

in photocatalytic water treatment with much work devoted to enhancing their overall oh yield and ultimately increasing organic contaminant elimination rates including for apis 67 however upscaling photocatalytic approaches using solar radiation e g sodis remains challenging and has so far failed to efficiently eliminate organic pollutants this has been demonstrated in multiple field studies using sunlight exposed batch containers wherein the required incubation time to eliminate pathogen loads in 2 l pet water bottles is 5 h with a photocatalyst vs 6 48 h under bright sunlight 59 64 65 5 new opportunities for novel photocatalytic materials most photocatalysts such as tio2 or zno absorb photons in the uv a range λ 315 400 nm however uv light produces only 4 6 of the whole solar spectrum with uv b and uv c radiation λ 315 nm largely absorbed by the stratosphere before reaching the earth s surface whilst visible light 400 nm provides up to 40 of total solar radiation 64 65 67 consequently many studies on photocatalysis focus on materials capable of absorbing light over a broad wavelength spectrum particularly in the visible light range to increase solar driven photocatalytic efficiency during water treatment 67 69 however tio2 and zno come with certain advantages when compared to other semiconductors they are inexpensive and yield high photocatalytic efficiency under uv light to generate ros and destroy pollutants such as apis tio2 is also ostensibly largely non toxic and is frequently applied in water treatment applications due to its low cost and its chemical thermal and photolytic stability however unmodified tio2 and zno have relatively wide band gaps 3 21 ev and 3 37 ev limiting their photocatalytic activity to the uv a spectrum 70 71 photocatalysts with wider band gaps 3 1 ev are unable to absorb light in the visible range hence under solar radiation alone many photocatalysts insufficiently excite electrons onto their conduction bands and most holes and electrons do not reach the electrolyte interface of the semiconductor surface to generate ros consequently excited electrons simply return to valence bands a process defined as recombination 60 72 in recent years substantial effort has been dedicated to investigating photocatalytic materials which exhibit narrower band gaps such as alpha phase bismuth oxide α bi2o3 2 91 ev bismuth vanadate bivo4 2 40 ev and graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 2 70 ev all of which allow rapid electron transfer to the mos surface to facilitate ros formation during visible light exposure 67 73 furthermore novel research is now focussing on surface tuning of photocatalytic materials noble metals such as gold au platinum pt or silver ag graphitic carbon structures carbon metalloids such as graphene and various mofs have all been successfully tested to extend the lifetime of photoexcited electrons and holes embedded into metal oxide nanostructures these highly conductive elements lower the required band gap energy noble metals or carbonaceous dopants can further function as electron traps and scavenge excited electrons from the conduction bands of the mos surface delaying recombination under visible light irradiation these dopants can act as photosensitisers and release previously trapped electrons which then migrate onto the conduction bands of the mos contributing to a controlled and constant charge separation of holes and electrons and improved photocatalytic performance 61 74 76 doping of mos materials with metallic or carbon elements allows light absorption of photocatalysts across a broad uv vis spectrum ultimately altering ros yields this promising effect is yet to be fully tested using conventional wider band gap materials such as tio2 or zno table 2 illustrates photocatalytic performances and material characteristics of various mof containing nanocomposites 6 immobilisation of photocatalysts photocatalyst leaching away from point of use may impact micropollutant degradation rates over time and or introduce potentially toxic nanomaterials into the environment therefore immobilisation of photocatalysts onto solid support materials such as metals plastics edged glass surfaces or embedding into porous carbon or membrane polymer structures is preferable and may facilitate recovery and reuse of photocatalytic materials this is particularly desirable in flow through applications such as hospital wastewater treatment where reusability of photocatalysts is considered essential for sustainable plant operation and leaching of nanomaterials into the environment is not desirable the future effective elimination of apis in immobilised photocatalytic systems will also largely depend on testing system parameters in a flow environment to account for seasonal and diurnal changes in drug mixture concentrations released from hospitals as well as wastewater temperature and ph the dosage coating density of the photocatalyst the sorption equilibrium between the drug and the catalyst and the effect of contact time and its optimisation for prolonged photocatalytic reaction time between the photocatalyst and the drug compound 82 83 separation of photocatalysts from the liquid phase via affixation onto large area surface supports such as cartridge filters is a relatively novel area of research and batch slurry reactors are still commonly preferred given their simple application however immobilised set ups have been shown to enhance light delivery to the photocatalyst surface and are less impacted by inner filter effects a common issue in slurry reactors caused by nanoscale catalyst suspensions inducing light scattering 60 edged glass beads are now a widely used support material in simple laboratory settings particularly in sodis applications where low temperature and cost saving immobilisation such as hydrothermal or sol gel approaches are favoured and more complex electro or vacuum deposition techniques are not feasible however in large scale flow through applications free floating support materials are simply impractical and may cause undesired hydrodynamic effects furthermore in flow through settings such as hospital wastewater treatment supports would be permanently exposed to fluid shearing stresses and common sol gel dip coating and subsequent low temperature hydrothermal treatment at 150 200 c may not sufficiently immobilise photocatalysts onto these solid supports a combination of drying and high temperature calcination of photocatalyst films onto porous surfaces has been shown to strongly incorporate photocatalytic nanomaterials onto surface structures calcination above 400 c in a furnace enhances the mechanical and structural strength of photocatalytic films by sintering densification and grain growth in an antipyrine degradation experiment tio2 film synthesis from a precursor sol with subsequent calcination at 500 c for 1 h in a furnace produced crystalline tio2 anatase sites with superior photocatalytic characteristics 84 in another study consecutive multi step heating polycondensation in a furnace produced a carbon based support material biochar with excellent adsorption characteristics e g porosity subsequent heating steps in combination with g c3n4 then synthesized a photocatalytic highly active nanocomposite 85 another effective approach for the deposition of photocatalytic nanomaterials on for example a membrane support is vacuum deposition i e physical vapour deposition pvd or chemical vapour deposition cvd vacuum deposition may become a preferable technique in future development of photocatalytic wastewater treatment designs as this technique allows a controlled synthesis of metallic nanomaterial thin films with a defined homogenous thickness and even nanomaterial distribution over large surface areas 86 89 pvd is already being deployed for mass production in areas such as electronics and the production of photovoltaics planar surfaces 3 d objects and powders can all be coated 7 promising support materials for a flow through water treatment approach carbonaceous materials such as activated biochar graphene carbon nanotubes cnts carbon quantum dots cqds feature unique surface characteristics which may be advantageous in a photocatalytic flow through scenario due to their blackbody character carbonaceous structures can absorb light across a broad uv vis spectrum 61 furthermore they are mechanically sturdy inert temperature and photo stable this makes them resistant to abrasion chemical and photolytic degradation and facilitates high temperature synthesis of photocatalyst thin films onto their surface the large specific surface area and porosity of carbonaceous materials may also enhance long term adhesion of photocatalyst coatings and contribute to a sustainable application of these materials in a flow through setting many carbonaceous materials also contain a high number of active sites on their surface comprising oxygen containing functional groups e g hydroxyl carboxyl and carbonyl groups these surface groups interact strongly with water molecules and increase the hydrophilicity of carbonaceous structures combined with the porous characteristics of carbonaceous materials hydrophilic surface groups enhance the superior water absorption capacities of these materials 90 in a wastewater treatment setting for the removal of apis the high hydrophilicity of a porous support may increase the interaction between aqueous apis and the photocatalyst surface which is vital for the efficient removal of pollutants from the aqueous phase graphitic carbon materials such as graphene have high electrical conductivity and electron storage capacity which allows them to scavenge electrons and regulate the separation of photoexcited holes and electrons fig 3 preventing recombination and contributing to the excellent photocatalytic performance of metallic carbonaceous materials e g carbon metal oxide composites such as zno g c3n4 tio2 graphene or tio2 cnt 58 72 91 one study on the photodegradation of organic compounds 4 chlorophenol and methyl orange with a zno g c3n4 nanocomposite demonstrated its excellent conductivity and improved electron hole separation compared to the metallic and carbonaceous precursor materials calcination for 1 h at 400 c formed a smooth interfacial layer between the two crystalline phases this heterojunction interface synergistically linked the different band gap energies of both materials the material combined the excellent uv light performance of zno with the capability of g c3n4 to absorb photons in the visible light spectrum which enabled the superior photoactivity of the zno g c3n4 nanocomposite 92 the use of biochar bc supported mos materials may also be advantageous in future flow through wastewater treatment scenarios as they combine a highly functionalised carbonaceous surface with environmental sustainability biomass derived photocatalytic supports are attractive for large scale wastewater treatment due to their affordability and the circularity of the precursor materials particularly when compared to surface enhancement with precious noble metal dopants as discussed previously multiple studies have shown that biochar produced from recycled waste e g sawdust coconut shell potato stem and rice straw which is then doped with metal oxide nanomaterials during biochar production pyrolysis provides superior api elimination vs non functionalised biochar 93 94 table 3 highlights the photocatalytic performance and material characteristics of various carbon based nanocomposites 8 conclusion and future perspectives heterogenous photocatalysis in an immobilised setting is an environmentally sustainable and effective approach for at source treatment of pharmaceutical polluted hospital wastewater novel reactor designs with immobilised photocatalysts need to ensure strong adherence of the catalyst onto the solid support material to allow sustainable treatment performance this is particularly true in a flow through setting where leaching of potentially harmful nanomaterials must be avoided at all costs incorporating affordable non toxic reusable metallic nanomaterials into porous carbon based support structures with excellent light absorption and hydrophilic characteristics alongside high physical chemical and photolytic stability could be a promising technique for future photocatalytic wastewater treatment however alongside ongoing efforts to improve photocatalytic efficiency of novel nanocomposites treatment designs with excellent uv a performance using conventional photocatalysts such as zno or tio2 need to be optimised in order to become more economically viable the energy efficiency of uv driven approaches can also be improved by implementing low energy led light arrays rather than using high energy xenon light bulbs energy saving plant designs with a reduced carbon footprint are ultimately essential to make future photocatalytic wastewater treatment more competitive vs established but energy demanding aops such as h2o2 enhanced uv treatment or ozone applications furthermore photocatalytic wastewater treatment shows potential as an environmentally friendly treatment alternative that does not release any toxic by products compared to existing aops e g ozone applications overall immobilised photocatalysis has great potential to become an economical and reusable tertiary treatment technique for future application at large scale to continuously eliminate various persistent and ecotoxic drugs from flow environments such as hospital wastewater without the risk of introducing additional pollutants such as potentially toxic

12581,active pharmaceutical ingredients apis are continuously released via hospital effluents and have been shown to be toxic to aquatic organisms even at very low concentrations future risks to human health might also emerge due to accumulation of these compounds in food chains through contamination of water supplies and propagation of antimicrobial resistance amr the ongoing global rise in drug prescribing rates is increasing api concentrations in aquatic environments current wastewater treatment plants wwtps are ineffective at removing many of these compounds pilot scale advanced oxidation processes aops at wwtps such as uv irradiation or ozone are not considered sustainable at the industrial scale due to their high operating cost and the potential for formation of toxic by products by contrast photocatalytic aops only require light induced activation of a reusable photocatalyst to eliminate the most persistent apis despite their sustainable characteristics photocatalytic aops have rarely been assessed for suitability in flow environments such as hospital wastewater this review highlights the advantages of photocatalytic aop based wastewater treatment compared to existing aops it also explores the immobilisation of effective photocatalytic metallic nanomaterials onto carbon based porous support structures as a future proof treatment concept for the elimination of apis from hospital wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords hospital wastewater treatment active pharmaceutical ingredients aquatic toxicity photocatalytic metallic nanomaterials porous support materials data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction organic micropollutants of anthropogenic origin such as pesticides and pharmaceuticals have been detected in surface water rivers lakes groundwater and drinking water worldwide 1 3 apis have attracted attention as priority substances of emerging concern given their potential to cause detrimental toxic effects on biota even at trace μg l 1 or ultra trace ng l 1 concentrations in the aquatic environment 4 6 over the last 40 years drug residues and their metabolites in wastewater effluents have been shown to cause acute and chronic adverse effects in aquatic organisms such as behavioural changes in fish exposed to antidepressants or feminisation of species exposed to the synthetic birth control hormone ethinylestradiol ee2 6 8 in addition antibiotics in wastewater are contributing to the ongoing and dramatic spread of antimicrobial resistance amr in microbial populations 9 12 the harmful effects of apis in the aquatic environment raise concerns regarding human health given their presence in receiving water and their inadequate removal by conventional wastewater treatment 6 in turn this may result in low level api occurrence in water supplies and or potential accumulation in food chains 13 although the ecotoxicity of some apis has been investigated in detail most of the 4000 apis licenced for disease treatment worldwide are still poorly classified in terms of their ecotoxicity or not monitored by national water quality regulatory bodies 14 17 wastewater originating specifically from hospitals contains a wide variety of apis and metabolites associated with patient urine and faeces 18 19 table 1 3 20 25 hospitals have been identified as key point sources for environmental api pollution due to their substantial water consumption 200 1200 l bed day continuous api release in hospital effluent and subsequent pollution of receiving waters 6 7 these hospital derived api mixtures with potentially enhanced ecotoxicity due to synergistic toxicity are commonly mixed with and diluted by domestic and industrial wastewater in communal sewers prior to wastewater treatment 6 26 27 most industrialised countries still use conventional activated sludge cas systems to treat their wastewater from hospitals households and industry however cas systems were never designed to remove the multitude of often persistent apis now discharged into wwtps they are primarily designed to remove readily degradable organic matter from wastewater to meet quality standards for surface water discharge i e set by the eu water framework directive and to prevent the spread of infectious microorganisms 17 21 28 the combined environmental impact of hospital derived apis the global rise in drug prescribing rates the increasing threat posed by amr and the continuous release of toxic chlorination by products from conventional wastewater treatment signals that global action is urgently needed to develop novel and more sustainable wastewater treatment solutions 6 11 29 30 this review explores the use of light driven photocatalytic api removal via advanced oxidation processes aops and its potential within flow environments such as hospital wastewater existing biological physico chemical and pilot scale aops for wastewater treatment are discussed and compared to novel photocatalytic approaches to evaluate api elimination efficiency from hospital wastewater and to provide an outlook on sustainability and affordability this review is the first to provide a comprehensive perspective on both conventional and novel photocatalytic nanomaterials and their immobilisation within a diverse range of organic support structures there is a particular focus on novel graphene based carbon nanostructures that offer unique characteristics in this regard 31 research considering flow through concepts for continuous photocatalytic wastewater treatment is still scarce in existing literature evaluating these novel approaches is essential for future research aimed at developing large scale photocatalytic solutions to enable at source elimination of apis from hospital effluents 2 biological wastewater treatment cas systems are the most common biological treatment techniques used in communal wwtps worldwide large scale cas systems utilising aerated sludge basins to oxidise and eliminate dissolved organic carbon doc using suspended aerobic and anaerobic microbes widely produce water quality that meets national discharge quality standards however quality standards are becoming stricter and starting to consider a wider range of potentially harmful compounds cas systems in isolation have limited elimination efficiency for many apis especially those that are recalcitrant to oxidative biodegradation such as diclofenac or carbamazepine 32 subsequent tertiary chemical oxidation processes such as hydrogen peroxide enhanced uv irradiation or ozonation are able to oxidise and eliminate apis via reactive oxygen species ros such as hydroxyl radicals but these processes are costly consume high amounts of energy and can produce toxic oxidation by products 33 promising alternatives to cas treatment include membrane biological reactors mbrs which have been piloted as a potential replacement for cas in several countries 34 mbrs have improved removal rates for doc nutrients and apis with high biodegradability e g paracetamol due to extended sludge retention and microorganism residence times and generation of smaller sludge flocs which may alter physical api removal through increased sorption onto sludge particles 35 37 in addition mbrs utilise ultra or nano filtration membranes pore size 0 03 0 06 μm following the activated sludge process to retain micropollutants 38 mbrs have been found to provide higher removal rates for antibiotics compared to cas and membrane filters can effectively retain antibiotic resistant bacteria preventing their dissemination into the environment in turn this diminishes the potential for horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistant genes across diverse microbial populations 38 39 however decentralised mbr treatment of hospital wastewater specifically with extended microorganism retention times may act to promote resistant gene evolution due to the more concentrated loads of antibiotics in hospital wastewater 29 enhanced removal rates for apis using mbr treatment have been shown for a diverse range of drug compounds particularly for those that are highly biodegradable nevertheless many apis are still detectable in mbr permeates after membrane filtration 6 33 40 mbr treatment features notable improvements over cas including a reduction in the need to use disinfecting chemicals due to the physical removal of pathogens substantial removal of multiple apis and the production of a clear effluent which does not require additional clarification such as sludge liquid separation 34 however the cost of mbr set up operation is much higher than cas due to additional sludge pumping needs membrane air scouring and the requirement to regularly replace clogged membranes 34 38 41 also some persistent apis remain recalcitrant to biodegradation using mbr and are thus poorly removed 6 3 tertiary wastewater treatment multiple studies have investigated the application of mbrs in combination with a diverse range of tertiary physico chemical treatment approaches designed to improve the elimination of api concentrations from hospital wastewater 40 42 43 amongst these studies several hospitals have been equipped with on site wastewater treatment mostly mbrs in combination with subsequent physico chemical techniques with the aim of targeting persistent apis recalcitrant to conventional secondary treatment such pilots have successfully demonstrated that a combination of treatment approaches enhances the elimination of a diverse range of apis when compared to a single solution approach 44 however each tertiary treatment process holds considerable disadvantages particularly with respect to enhanced operating costs and sustainability limitations due to regular requirements to replace or regenerate system components such as activated carbon overall a combination of mbr as a secondary treatment technique followed by advanced oxidation such as h2o2 enhanced uv irradiation or h2o2 enhanced ozonation and subsequent filtration by powdered activated carbon were identified as the most effective solutions for sustainable elimination of apis from hospital wastewater 33 45 46 advanced oxidation processes have emerged as promising wastewater treatment techniques for degrading organic pollutants such as apis via ros synthesis hydroxyl radicals oh are the most reactive oxidisers amongst radical species with a redox potential between 1 95 ev ph 14 2 8 ev ph 0 and a reaction rate constant between 108 and 1010 m 1 s 1 47 oh can rapidly and non selectively inactivate harmful apis by reacting with the aromatic ring structures of the drug molecule 48 however due to the extremely short half life of oh most aops only work sustainably with continuous supplementation with oxidising agents such as h2o2 or o3 alternatively irradiation with light in combination with a reusable conductive nanomaterial can generate ros such as in heterogenous photocatalysis 47 h 2 o 2 enhanced uv irradiation is the most popular aop in large scale tertiary wastewater treatment due to its advantages over stand alone uv light induced photolysis to enhance elimination of organic material this is achieved through light induced formation of oh from h2o2 which non selectively oxidises organic compounds such as apis 44 49 50 a pilot study within the eu pharmaceutical input and elimination from local sources pills project revealed that h2o2 treatment in combination with uv light exposure of mbr pre treated wastewater substantially increased api elimination rates however high electrical energy costs and h2o2 dosage requirements were incurred the study further showed that under pure uv irradiation without h2o2 86 of investigated pharmaceuticals including persistent compounds like diclofenac and carbamazepine could be eliminated by photolysis again the energy requirements for this process were substantial 10 kwh m 3 under h2o2 treatment 94 of the most non persistent compounds could be oxidised requiring only half as much energy successful elimination of persistent compounds i e 67 removal of carbamazepine vs only 10 removal after mbr treatment could be achieved under moderate uv light exposure 2 kwh m 3 but required more uv light exposure time and higher h2o2 consumption overall h2o2 enhanced uv light applications inevitably require considerable amounts of electrical energy 49 also key wastewater matrix characteristics e g turbidity suspended solids may negatively influence light penetration and impact photolytic api degradation in addition alkaline wastewater may contain bicarbonate ions which can scavenge oh and further impact overall api oxidation efficiency 51 52 h 2 o 2 enhanced ozonation is a highly effective technique to eliminate a diverse range of organic compounds ozone generates oh during its decay and in the presence of h2o2 the decomposition of ozone is catalysed accelerating the generation of oh consequently h2o2 enhanced ozonation oxidises most organic micropollutants even recalcitrant apis efficiently another effective but extremely energy demanding process is the combination of uv irradiation and aqueous ozone known as photoinduced ozonation which generates h2o2 initiating ozone decay and the production of oh 51 at a hospital wastewater pilot scale treatment plant in switzerland where mbr was used for secondary treatment several post treatment technologies were tested with ozonation successfully delivering removal rates of 97 for all tested apis including carbamazepine diclofenac ciprofloxacin clarithromycin sulfamethoxazole and ranitidine overall api removal efficiency was 90 using ozonation 86 using powdered activated carbon while uv irradiation only eliminated 33 of apis in this setting 50 ozone is a potent oxidiser for a broad spectrum of apis at very low aqueous concentrations it generally requires lower energy consumption when compared to uv irradiation during continuous application however ozone production is also a very wasteful process as most of the energy required is lost as unused heat the production of 1 kg o3 from o2 requires 12 kwh of electrical energy 44 wastewater matrix effects such as suspended solids only have a limited impact on ozone promoted api oxidation rates 53 however ph may significantly influence ozone decay and compound elimination 54 this pilot study 55 showed that drastically decreased ozone decomposition rates were seen at lower ph at ph 7 75 the time taken to fully decompose 10 mg l 1 of ozone was 1 min while at ph 5 it was 10 min this suggests that ozonation in more acidic wastewater below ph 7 75 may not eliminate all pollutants effectively the main drawback of ozone dependent processes in wastewater treatment is high energy consumption albeit lower than for uv irradiation and a dependence on specific water characteristics such as ph this parameter may vary significantly in wastewater and be affected by diurnal seasonal differences in water consumption and effluent composition at hospitals the removal of ozone to prevent atmospheric pollution also requires final effluent filtration with for example activated carbon this adds additional costs to the treatment process ozonation will non selectively oxidise organic matter and eliminate many toxic api molecules however little research has been undertaken to determine the toxicity of the resulting oxidised transformation products and most are ostensibly unknown 56 a multitude of toxic by products can also be produced during ozone exposure such as carcinogenic substances like bromates or n nitrosodimethylamines ndmas 50 57 fig 1 summarises currently available conventional and advanced wastewater treatment techniques states their suitability for the elimination of apis and their potential to introduce toxic transformation by products into the environment 4 photocatalytic wastewater treatment photocatalysis has recently emerged as a novel and sustainable alternative for future wastewater treatment photocatalysis involves light activation of a reusable conductive metallic nanomaterial 58 compared to conventional aops such as ozone or pure uv light treatment photocatalysis is thought to be free of toxic by products in addition the use of sunlight as the uv source solar disinfection sodis has been found to be a viable eco friendly means of disinfecting drinking water however the present drawback of photocatalysis is the extensive treatment time needed to achieve acceptable target compound removal rates 59 therefore both future photocatalytic materials and plant designs need to be optimised in order to increase photocatalytic efficiencies 60 heterogenous photocatalytic treatment settings which use high energy uv light combined with reusable metallic nanomaterials have been shown to degrade even persistent apis 61 the use of co catalysts such as noble metals or porous metal organic frameworks mofs in combination with uv light effective photocatalysts may substantially reduce treatment times furthermore immobilisation of photocatalysts onto porous carbonaceous support structures with superior mechanical stability could become a valuable approach in a flow through treatment setting i e for hospital wastewater 4 1 homogenous photocatalysis photo fenton is a light driven water treatment process which is effective at uv vis wavelengths up to 600 nm large scale open systems effectively sunlight based systems can make use of 28 35 of total solar energy 62 the photo fenton process is however dependent on supplementation with fenton s reagent a solution of h2o2 and ferrous iron fe2 salts such as feso4 the reaction of h2o2 and fe2 generates oh and ferric iron fe3 species conversely aqueous fe3 can react photochemically to recycle fe2 under illumination overall the photo fenton process generates ros autocatalytically under uv vis irradiation and absorbs light over a relatively wide wavelength spectrum it has significant potential for api removal as the oh production rate is high until the h2o2 is fully depleted furthermore limited toxic by products are formed during photo fenton compared to other aops ferric iron salts are environmentally benign if released in moderate amounts and excess h2o2 is consumed during the fenton reaction 51 however at large scale continuous supplementation with fenton s reagent is expensive 38 and excess release of fe3 into the environment may be harmful 63 furthermore an excess of h2o2 or fe2 can cause oh trapping therefore optimal dosing of fenton s reagent is essential to allow eco friendly wastewater treatment that yields a high pollutant elimination rate other factors that limit full scale application include the need for frequent ph adjustment photo fenton chemistry is most efficient under acidic conditions ph 3 to prevent precipitation of stable ferric salts in addition since photocatalytic recycling of fe2 is slow fe3 may form stable complexes with other organic compounds such as carboxylic acids which would block the photocatalytic cycle i e the regeneration of ferrous iron 51 4 2 heterogenous photocatalysis novel aops for tertiary wastewater treatment exclusively driven by light irradiation show promise to disinfect wastewater and eliminate organic micropollutants such as apis without adding harsh chemical oxidisers or producing toxic by products such systems could be nature based and use renewable energy e g sunlight in a wastewater treatment setting 64 65 light activated aops can generate oh under aqueous conditions in the presence of uv or visible light oxygen and a reusable photocatalyst such as a metal oxide semiconductor mos this process of light activated oh production is known as heterogenous photocatalysis 66 in solid materials a specific band gap between the electronic valence and conduction bands of single atoms defines the material s capability to allow a flow of electrons from the valence to the conduction bands ultimately specifying its conductivity under an external energy source e g light irradiation electrons of semiconductor materials which have a relatively narrow band gap can be excited from valence to conduction bands leaving behind unfilled positively charged holes hvb while filling conduction bands with an electronic negative charge ecb mos surfaces often in the form of large area nanomaterial coatings immersed in an electrolyte e g water can generate charged holes hvb and electrons ecb at the electrolyte interface between the charged metallic surface and the aqueous phase both hvb and ecb can then promote redox reactions on the metallic surface under oxygenated aqueous conditions these redox reactions ultimately generate mainly oh but also reaction intermediates such as superoxide o2 hydrogen superoxide ho2 and h2o2 all of which can oxidise and destroy pollutants such as apis which come into contact with the semiconductor surface 51 60 fig 2 describes the underlying redox reaction principle and photocatalytic mechanism on a semiconductor surface 4 3 redox reactions in photocatalytic water treatment hole

in photocatalytic water treatment with much work devoted to enhancing their overall oh yield and ultimately increasing organic contaminant elimination rates including for apis 67 however upscaling photocatalytic approaches using solar radiation e g sodis remains challenging and has so far failed to efficiently eliminate organic pollutants this has been demonstrated in multiple field studies using sunlight exposed batch containers wherein the required incubation time to eliminate pathogen loads in 2 l pet water bottles is 5 h with a photocatalyst vs 6 48 h under bright sunlight 59 64 65 5 new opportunities for novel photocatalytic materials most photocatalysts such as tio2 or zno absorb photons in the uv a range λ 315 400 nm however uv light produces only 4 6 of the whole solar spectrum with uv b and uv c radiation λ 315 nm largely absorbed by the stratosphere before reaching the earth s surface whilst visible light 400 nm provides up to 40 of total solar radiation 64 65 67 consequently many studies on photocatalysis focus on materials capable of absorbing light over a broad wavelength spectrum particularly in the visible light range to increase solar driven photocatalytic efficiency during water treatment 67 69 however tio2 and zno come with certain advantages when compared to other semiconductors they are inexpensive and yield high photocatalytic efficiency under uv light to generate ros and destroy pollutants such as apis tio2 is also ostensibly largely non toxic and is frequently applied in water treatment applications due to its low cost and its chemical thermal and photolytic stability however unmodified tio2 and zno have relatively wide band gaps 3 21 ev and 3 37 ev limiting their photocatalytic activity to the uv a spectrum 70 71 photocatalysts with wider band gaps 3 1 ev are unable to absorb light in the visible range hence under solar radiation alone many photocatalysts insufficiently excite electrons onto their conduction bands and most holes and electrons do not reach the electrolyte interface of the semiconductor surface to generate ros consequently excited electrons simply return to valence bands a process defined as recombination 60 72 in recent years substantial effort has been dedicated to investigating photocatalytic materials which exhibit narrower band gaps such as alpha phase bismuth oxide α bi2o3 2 91 ev bismuth vanadate bivo4 2 40 ev and graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 2 70 ev all of which allow rapid electron transfer to the mos surface to facilitate ros formation during visible light exposure 67 73 furthermore novel research is now focussing on surface tuning of photocatalytic materials noble metals such as gold au platinum pt or silver ag graphitic carbon structures carbon metalloids such as graphene and various mofs have all been successfully tested to extend the lifetime of photoexcited electrons and holes embedded into metal oxide nanostructures these highly conductive elements lower the required band gap energy noble metals or carbonaceous dopants can further function as electron traps and scavenge excited electrons from the conduction bands of the mos surface delaying recombination under visible light irradiation these dopants can act as photosensitisers and release previously trapped electrons which then migrate onto the conduction bands of the mos contributing to a controlled and constant charge separation of holes and electrons and improved photocatalytic performance 61 74 76 doping of mos materials with metallic or carbon elements allows light absorption of photocatalysts across a broad uv vis spectrum ultimately altering ros yields this promising effect is yet to be fully tested using conventional wider band gap materials such as tio2 or zno table 2 illustrates photocatalytic performances and material characteristics of various mof containing nanocomposites 6 immobilisation of photocatalysts photocatalyst leaching away from point of use may impact micropollutant degradation rates over time and or introduce potentially toxic nanomaterials into the environment therefore immobilisation of photocatalysts onto solid support materials such as metals plastics edged glass surfaces or embedding into porous carbon or membrane polymer structures is preferable and may facilitate recovery and reuse of photocatalytic materials this is particularly desirable in flow through applications such as hospital wastewater treatment where reusability of photocatalysts is considered essential for sustainable plant operation and leaching of nanomaterials into the environment is not desirable the future effective elimination of apis in immobilised photocatalytic systems will also largely depend on testing system parameters in a flow environment to account for seasonal and diurnal changes in drug mixture concentrations released from hospitals as well as wastewater temperature and ph the dosage coating density of the photocatalyst the sorption equilibrium between the drug and the catalyst and the effect of contact time and its optimisation for prolonged photocatalytic reaction time between the photocatalyst and the drug compound 82 83 separation of photocatalysts from the liquid phase via affixation onto large area surface supports such as cartridge filters is a relatively novel area of research and batch slurry reactors are still commonly preferred given their simple application however immobilised set ups have been shown to enhance light delivery to the photocatalyst surface and are less impacted by inner filter effects a common issue in slurry reactors caused by nanoscale catalyst suspensions inducing light scattering 60 edged glass beads are now a widely used support material in simple laboratory settings particularly in sodis applications where low temperature and cost saving immobilisation such as hydrothermal or sol gel approaches are favoured and more complex electro or vacuum deposition techniques are not feasible however in large scale flow through applications free floating support materials are simply impractical and may cause undesired hydrodynamic effects furthermore in flow through settings such as hospital wastewater treatment supports would be permanently exposed to fluid shearing stresses and common sol gel dip coating and subsequent low temperature hydrothermal treatment at 150 200 c may not sufficiently immobilise photocatalysts onto these solid supports a combination of drying and high temperature calcination of photocatalyst films onto porous surfaces has been shown to strongly incorporate photocatalytic nanomaterials onto surface structures calcination above 400 c in a furnace enhances the mechanical and structural strength of photocatalytic films by sintering densification and grain growth in an antipyrine degradation experiment tio2 film synthesis from a precursor sol with subsequent calcination at 500 c for 1 h in a furnace produced crystalline tio2 anatase sites with superior photocatalytic characteristics 84 in another study consecutive multi step heating polycondensation in a furnace produced a carbon based support material biochar with excellent adsorption characteristics e g porosity subsequent heating steps in combination with g c3n4 then synthesized a photocatalytic highly active nanocomposite 85 another effective approach for the deposition of photocatalytic nanomaterials on for example a membrane support is vacuum deposition i e physical vapour deposition pvd or chemical vapour deposition cvd vacuum deposition may become a preferable technique in future development of photocatalytic wastewater treatment designs as this technique allows a controlled synthesis of metallic nanomaterial thin films with a defined homogenous thickness and even nanomaterial distribution over large surface areas 86 89 pvd is already being deployed for mass production in areas such as electronics and the production of photovoltaics planar surfaces 3 d objects and powders can all be coated 7 promising support materials for a flow through water treatment approach carbonaceous materials such as activated biochar graphene carbon nanotubes cnts carbon quantum dots cqds feature unique surface characteristics which may be advantageous in a photocatalytic flow through scenario due to their blackbody character carbonaceous structures can absorb light across a broad uv vis spectrum 61 furthermore they are mechanically sturdy inert temperature and photo stable this makes them resistant to abrasion chemical and photolytic degradation and facilitates high temperature synthesis of photocatalyst thin films onto their surface the large specific surface area and porosity of carbonaceous materials may also enhance long term adhesion of photocatalyst coatings and contribute to a sustainable application of these materials in a flow through setting many carbonaceous materials also contain a high number of active sites on their surface comprising oxygen containing functional groups e g hydroxyl carboxyl and carbonyl groups these surface groups interact strongly with water molecules and increase the hydrophilicity of carbonaceous structures combined with the porous characteristics of carbonaceous materials hydrophilic surface groups enhance the superior water absorption capacities of these materials 90 in a wastewater treatment setting for the removal of apis the high hydrophilicity of a porous support may increase the interaction between aqueous apis and the photocatalyst surface which is vital for the efficient removal of pollutants from the aqueous phase graphitic carbon materials such as graphene have high electrical conductivity and electron storage capacity which allows them to scavenge electrons and regulate the separation of photoexcited holes and electrons fig 3 preventing recombination and contributing to the excellent photocatalytic performance of metallic carbonaceous materials e g carbon metal oxide composites such as zno g c3n4 tio2 graphene or tio2 cnt 58 72 91 one study on the photodegradation of organic compounds 4 chlorophenol and methyl orange with a zno g c3n4 nanocomposite demonstrated its excellent conductivity and improved electron hole separation compared to the metallic and carbonaceous precursor materials calcination for 1 h at 400 c formed a smooth interfacial layer between the two crystalline phases this heterojunction interface synergistically linked the different band gap energies of both materials the material combined the excellent uv light performance of zno with the capability of g c3n4 to absorb photons in the visible light spectrum which enabled the superior photoactivity of the zno g c3n4 nanocomposite 92 the use of biochar bc supported mos materials may also be advantageous in future flow through wastewater treatment scenarios as they combine a highly functionalised carbonaceous surface with environmental sustainability biomass derived photocatalytic supports are attractive for large scale wastewater treatment due to their affordability and the circularity of the precursor materials particularly when compared to surface enhancement with precious noble metal dopants as discussed previously multiple studies have shown that biochar produced from recycled waste e g sawdust coconut shell potato stem and rice straw which is then doped with metal oxide nanomaterials during biochar production pyrolysis provides superior api elimination vs non functionalised biochar 93 94 table 3 highlights the photocatalytic performance and material characteristics of various carbon based nanocomposites 8 conclusion and future perspectives heterogenous photocatalysis in an immobilised setting is an environmentally sustainable and effective approach for at source treatment of pharmaceutical polluted hospital wastewater novel reactor designs with immobilised photocatalysts need to ensure strong adherence of the catalyst onto the solid support material to allow sustainable treatment performance this is particularly true in a flow through setting where leaching of potentially harmful nanomaterials must be avoided at all costs incorporating affordable non toxic reusable metallic nanomaterials into porous carbon based support structures with excellent light absorption and hydrophilic characteristics alongside high physical chemical and photolytic stability could be a promising technique for future photocatalytic wastewater treatment however alongside ongoing efforts to improve photocatalytic efficiency of novel nanocomposites treatment designs with excellent uv a performance using conventional photocatalysts such as zno or tio2 need to be optimised in order to become more economically viable the energy efficiency of uv driven approaches can also be improved by implementing low energy led light arrays rather than using high energy xenon light bulbs energy saving plant designs with a reduced carbon footprint are ultimately essential to make future photocatalytic wastewater treatment more competitive vs established but energy demanding aops such as h2o2 enhanced uv treatment or ozone applications furthermore photocatalytic wastewater treatment shows potential as an environmentally friendly treatment alternative that does not release any toxic by products compared to existing

12582,photocatalytic fuel cell is a promising wastewater treatment technology which can degrade pollutants and generate electricity simultaneously however the development of high performance photoanode remains a challenge for photocatalytic fuel cells inspired by the bionic material of polydopamine we propose to apply polydopamine to prepare the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode for enhancing the adsorption of protonated g c3n4 nanosheets onto tio2 via electrostatic interaction which greatly promotes charge transfer and inhibits electron hole recombination moreover the polydopamine particles can be converted into plenty of pores during the calcination process which enhances light scattering and mass transfer consequently the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode prepared with polydopamine inspiration exhibits superior photoelectrochemical activity than the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode prepared without using polydopamine and the pristine tio2 photoanode presenting an improvement in the maximal power density by 8 7 and 70 4 respectively in addition the effect of the adsorption time of the protonated g c3n4 nanosheets is also studied it is shown that an excessive amount of the protonated g c3n4 nanosheets by increasing the adsorption time leads to more serious recombination and thereby decreases the photoanode performance this study provides a novel and efficient way to prepare composite photoanode for photoelectrochemical applications keywords polydopamine protonated g c3n4 nanosheets photoanode electrostatic interaction photocatalytic fuel cell data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with rapid industrialization a large amount of wastewater has been discharged into natural water body resulting in severe water pollution problem and thereby receiving extensive attention 1 3 however conventional wastewater treatment technologies mainly aim at efficient pollutant removal while recycling plentiful chemical energy contained in sewage is rarely considered 4 7 photocatalytic fuel cell pfc has been deemed to be one of the promising wastewater treatment technologies because it enables simultaneous pollutant degradation and electricity generation under sunlight illumination 8 10 generally a pfc consists of a photoanode a cathode photocathode and an electrolyte 11 of these the photoelectrocatalytic activity of the photoanode dominates the pfc performance because the carriers generated by light excitation proceed the mineralization of pollutants 12 tio2 has been widely used to develop the photoanode due to its nontoxicity photochemical stability and high oxidizing reactivity 13 14 however pristine tio2 can only respond to ultraviolet light owing to its large band gap 3 2 ev so that low solar energy utilization remains the bottleneck 15 one of the approaches to address this issue is to form heterojunctions via coupling other semiconductors with a narrow band gap which broadens the light absorption range 16 18 graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 is a metal free semiconductor with a suitable band gap 2 7 ev making it visible light responsive 19 moreover g c3n4 can be synthesized via green and facile method 20 however g c3n4 also faces a problem of severe electron hole recombination 21 a potential method to improve visible light harvesting of tio2 based photoanode is to form heterojunctions by coupling tio2 with g c3n4 due to their matched band potentials moreover their coupling can also promote the separation of electrons and holes 22 23 nevertheless the tio2 g c3n4 composite photocatalysts still face some challenges such as non uniform composition weak connection between tio2 and g c3n4 limited light scattering and poor mass transfer in particular interfacial adhesion plays a significant role in charge transfer and photocatalytic performance 24 25 therefore it is necessary to prepare the tio2 g c3n4 composite photocatalyst with enhanced interfacial adhesion light scattering and mass transfer polydopamine pda a mussels inspired material has attracted massive interest in applications of energy conversion pollutant removal and fine chemistry 26 for example pda could serve as a template to prepare the photoanode applied in a pfc 27 zhang et al 28 applied the size controlled pda microparticles in water restoration for lead ii removal feng et al 29 used pda to functionalize the surface of a microreactor for nitrobenzene hydrogenation cheng et al 30 constructed robust fe3o4 pda ag fenton like catalysts by which highly efficient micropollutant decomposition was achieved the pullulan pda hydrogels were developed by the same group for selective adsorption of cationic dyes 31 in addition because pda has a large number of phenolic hydroxyl and n containing functional groups on its surface it can be firmly immobilized on almost all types of substrates 32 particularly pda potentially exhibits ampholyticity or zwitterionicity because of the coexistence of phenolic hydroxyl and amine groups 33 the surface charge can be regulated by controlling the ph value of solution 34 pda can then be immobilized on different materials via electrostatic interaction including semiconductors and noble metals 35 36 therefore the use of pda can potentially address the above issues encountered in preparing the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode inspired by the unique features of pda we herein propose a new strategy to prepare the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode in which pda is functioned as an adsorbent and pore forming agent the incorporation of pda into the photoanode preparation improves the adsorption of protonated g c3n4 nanosheets onto tio2 via electrostatic adsorption which promotes charge transfer and enhances the separation of electrons and holes besides the light scattering and mass transfer within the photoanode prepared by this method can be enhanced due to the formation of micropores after pda removal therefore the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode prepared with polydopamine inspiration exhibited good photoelectrochemical activity in addition a pfc towards simultaneous wastewater treatment and electricity generation was also developed to evaluate the superiority of the prepared photoanode 2 experimental section 2 1 preparation of protonated g c3n4 nanosheets the synthesis process of the protonated g c3n4 nanosheets can refer to an earlier study 37 firstly the bulk g c3n4 was obtained by calcining 2 g melamine aladdin at 520 c for 4 h in the nitrogen atmosphere the bulk g c3n4 was ultrasonically dispersed in glycol 98 mreda for 5 h then the obtained dispersion was centrifuged 30 000 rpm for 10 min and 10 000 rpm for 10 min subsequently to achieve g c3n4 nanosheets finally 0 06 g g c3n4 nanosheets were ultrasonically suspended in 60 ml hcl solution for 5 h before being centrifuged at 10000 rpm to obtain the suspension the suspension was cleaned until the solution became neutral the protonated g c3n4 nanosheets were then obtained after the solution was dried 2 2 preparation of photoanode fig 1 illustrates the process of the pda inspired preparation of the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode firstly the fto conductive glass zhuhai kaivo optoelectronic technology co ltd which was used as the substrate for coating the photocatalysts was ultrasonically washed in acetone ethanol and deionized water subsequently before being dried at 60 c commercial tio2 nanoparticles aeroxide p25 acros belgium were used to prepare tio2 sol which was sprayed onto the cleaned fto conductive glass by the wet spraying method and the loading of tio2 was controlled at 1 0 mg cm2 the photoanode composed of only tio2 was prepared by calcination at 400 c for 0 5 h such a photoanode is simply termed as the tio2 photoanode the tio2 photoanode was immersed in the prepared solution containing dopamine hydrochloride 98 sigma aldrich with a concentration of 0 05 mg ml for 0 5 h and in tris for 3 h by doing this plenty of pda particles were formed on the tio2 surface followed by rinsing with deionized water which was denoted as the tio2 pda photoanode the tio2 pda photoanode was then immersed in the prepared suspension containing 1 0 mg ml protonated g c3n4 for 1 h after the soaking and adsorption the protonated g c3n4 nanosheets were adsorbed onto the tio2 pda photoanode followed by drying at 60 c finally these pda particles were removed by calcination at 450 c with a temperature ramp of 5 c min for 2 h to form the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode for comparison a photoanode was prepared by directly coating the protonated g c3n4 nanosheets onto the tio2 without adding pda between them before calcination which was termed as the tio2 no pda g c3n4 photoanode the amount of the protonated g c3n4 nanosheets in the photoanode could be adjusted by controlling the adsorption time in the prepared suspension containing 1 0 mg ml protonated g c3n4 nanosheets in this work the adsorption time was 1 0 h 2 0 h and 3 0 h respectively the larger the adsorption time the larger the amount of the adsorbed protonated g c3n4 nanosheets 2 3 characterizations the microscopic morphologies of the prepared photoanodes were investigated employing scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi su8020 the phase compositions of the photoanodes were monitored via x ray diffraction xrd brucker d8 advance over a diffraction angle 2θ range of 10 90 the chemical valences of elements ti and n in the photoanodes were analyzed utilizing x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermal escalab 250xi and the xps spectra were normalized with the adventitious carbon c1s at a binding energy of 284 8 ev 38 the uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra uv vis drs shimadzu uv3600 were used to determine the light absorption range of the photoanode in a range of 200 800 nm the separation of photo generated carriers was characterized by photoluminescence spectroscopy pl edinburgh instruments fls1000 photoelectrochemical activities of these photoanodes were characterized using a three electrode system the as prepared photoanode pt foil and ag agcl were served as the working electrode the counter electrode and the reference electrode respectively the electrolyte was composed of 1 0 m koh and 0 5 m ch3oh a xe lamp cel hxf300 china with an am 1 5 g filter was chosen for illumination and the density of simulated light was fixed at 100 mw cm2 measured by a photo radio meter cel fz a the linear sweep voltammetry lsv electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis and photo current response i t of the prepared photoanodes were tested employing an electrochemical workstation zahner elektrik gmbh cokg germany in addition to the use of methanol as a model pollutant we also used methylene blue as a pollutant to characterize the degradation efficiency of these photoanodes the mb concentration was determined from the absorption spectrum using a uv vis spectrophotometer tu 1950 persee china at a wavelength of 664 nm 2 4 construction and evaluation of pfc the pfc consisted of a chamber in the middle the prepared photoanode 1 0 cm 1 0 cm and the air breathing cathode the air breathing cathode was prepared by loading pt black on carbon paper with the same surface area as the photoanode the electrolyte and light source were similar to the case of the photoelectrochemical activity characterization the liquid flow rate was maintained at 200 μl min by a pump lsp04 1a longer china in the evaluation of the pfc performance methanol is chosen as a model pollutant because methanol contained wastewater widely exists not only in methanol synthesis but also in pharmaceutical petrochemical and paper industries etc 39 40 moreover methanol is the simplest alcohol whose intermediates can be effectively mineralized 41 as a result the methanol contained wastewater treatment performance can be reflected by the discharging performance of the pfc the better the discharging performance the better the degradation performance here the performance of pfc was monitored by an electronic load system ct 3008 neware technology ltd china in terms of discharging current voltage curve j v current power curve j p open circuit voltage v oc short circuit current density j sc and maximum power density p max all experiments were repeated at least three times to achieve creditable data 3 results and discussion 3 1 photoanode characterization the microscopic morphologies of the bulk g c3n4 protonated g c3n4 nanosheets tio2 tio2 pda coating of pda onto tio2 tio2 g c3n4 coating protonated g c3n4 onto tio2 assisted by pda adsorption time 1 h and tio2 no pda g c3n4 direct coating of protonated g c3n4 nanosheets onto tio2 without using pda photoanodes were indicated generally the bulk g c3n4 formed by calcination of melamine showed a typically mixed aggregated morphology with flake and bulk structures fig 2a and the sizes mainly fell in a few microns which was consistent with previous studies 37 the surface of the protonated g c3n4 nanosheets was rougher and more surface was exposed than the bulk g c3n4 fig 2b because the van der waals force between g c3n4 layers was destroyed under strong acid condition and sonication treatment 42 the protonated g c3n4 nanosheets can promote the photoresponse due to the size reduction and the change of the microscopic surface 43 in addition the comparison between fig 2c and d confirmed the presence of the pda particles which were uniformly distributed on the tio2 surface these pda particles could form a vigorous porous structure after calcination 27 which facilitated light scattering and mass transport inside the photoanode besides the pda particles also provided more sites for adsorbing the protonated g c3n4 nanosheets by electrostatic interaction therefore the protonated g c3n4 nanosheets could be more efficiently and firmly adsorbed on the pda surface by comparing fig 2e and f the zeta potentials of each component can be used to reflect their electrostatic interactions as shown in fig 2g the zeta potential of protonated g c3n4 nanosheets was changed positively to 19 8 mv because of the acidification treatment 44 while that of bulk g c3n4 was still negative 23 0 ev because the zeta potential of pda was approximately 22 3 mv 45 the protonated g c3n4 nanosheets could be efficiently adsorbed onto the pda via electrostatic interaction these results indicate the use of pda is beneficial for the preparation of the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode the phase structure of the protonated g c3n4 tio2 and tio2 g c3n4 were characterized as shown in fig 2h there existed a peak at 2θ 27 4 for the protonated g c3n4 nanosheets representing the graphitized crystalline surface due to the stacking of the conjugated aromatic system which was in agreement with the open literature 46 by contrast with respect to bulk g c3n4 the absence of a distinctive peak at 2θ 13 3 indicated successful protonation of g c3n4 as for the tio2 and tio2 g c3n4 photoanodes both of them exhibited characteristic diffraction peaks corresponding to the anatase phase and rutile phase of tio2 at the same position in fig 2h which indicated that the crystal morphology of tio2 in the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode was not affected by the deposition of the protonated g c3n4 nanosheets meanwhile the inserted xrd results indicated a negative shift of a peak at 2θ 27 4 for the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode relative to tio2 in virtue of the deposition of the protonated g c3n4 nanosheets furthermore we conducted the xps tests on the tio2 g c3n4 and tio2 photoanodes to obtain the chemical compositions and states of various elements ti and n given in fig 3a and b for pure tio2 the two peaks at 458 6 ev and 464 4 ev in ti 2p spectra confirmed the electronic state of ti4 however no peak at 392 408 ev was observed in the deconvolution of n 1s spectra for the tio2 photoanode but it could be observed for the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode besides the presence of protonated g c3n4 nanosheets and charge transfer caused the peak shift for the ti 2p spectrum of the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode 47 high resolution xps spectrum for the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode demonstrated that the binding energy of ti 2p shifted to low energy region and the n 1s spectrum of the photoanode could be deconvoluted into three constituent peaks at the binding energies of 398 6 ev 400 1 ev and 401 1 ev respectively the differences in the n 1s spectrum between tio2 and tio2 g c3n4 was a result of different forms of n the sp2 hybridized nitrogen cnc the sp3 hybridized nitrogen n c 3 and amino functional group cnh 48 in addition the xps valence band spectra of the samples were also determined as seen in fig 3c the valence band evb of pure tio2 was 2 87 ev but the evb of tio2 g c3n4 was reduced to 2 71 ev clearly the addition of the protonated g c3n4 nanosheets with the evb of 1 78 ev was beneficial for the reduction in the valence band of the prepared photoanode the uv vis drs testing results are shown in fig 3d pure tio2 presented ultraviolet light absorption with an absorbing edge of approximately 400 nm because the protonated g c3n4 nanosheets showed visible light response the light absorption edge of tio2 g c3n4 was extended to about 430 nm the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode showed stronger absorbance in both the ultraviolet and visible light regions than tio2 which can be attributed to the formation of heterojunction the band gap was estimated by the kubelka munk equation 49 the band gaps of the protonated g c3n4 and tio2 were 2 72 ev and 3 17 ev respectively while their combination led to a band gap of 3 05 ev inserted figure in fig 3d the energy band was lowered and the visible light response was enabled due to the formation of heterojunction furthermore the conduction bands ecb of the protonated g c3n4 nanosheets and tio2 were also obtained which were 0 94 ev and 0 29 ev respectively the performance of the photoanode is greatly affected by the separation of electrons and holes and photocarrier migration therefore the photoluminescence spectroscopy was characterized in the present study fig 4a compares the pl spectra of various photoanodes including the tio2 protonated g c3n4 tio2 no pda g c3n4 and tio2 g c3n4 photoanodes it could be found that although the protonated g c3n4 had a small band gap to absorb more solar energy the recombination of photo generated carriers was rather serious leading to an extremely high peak which was even higher than tio2 the coupling of the protonated g c3n4 and tio2 decreased the pl emission peak particularly the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode with their adhesion enhanced by pda showed a much smaller pl emission peak than did the tio2 no pda g c3n4 photoanode indicating a higher electron hole separation efficiency this is because the use of pda enhanced the adsorption between tio2 and protonated g c3n4 nanosheets which was in favor of forming the heterojunction as a result the charge transfer was accelerated to inhibit the recombination to further confirm this point the eis measurements were performed for these photoanodes as shown in fig 4b the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode displayed the smallest impedance indicating the lowest charge transfer resistance although the tio2 no pda g c3n4 photoanode prepared by direct adsorption showed larger charge transfer resistance than the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode it was still smaller than the pure tio2 and protonated g c3n4 photoanodes which were consistent with the pl results according to the above results it can be concluded that the photoanode prepared with pda inspiration shows enhanced adsorption and adhesion between tio2 and protonated g c3n4 nanosheets thereby facilitating the charge transfer and inhibiting the recombination in addition to evaluating the electron hole separation in terms of pl and eis we also characterized the photoelectrochemical activities and photo current responses of these photoanodes in a three electrode system the photocurrent density of pure tio2 photoanode was 0 26 ma cm2 at an applied voltage of 0 2 v vs ag agcl fig 5a which was lower than other photoanodes when the protonated g c3n4 nanosheets were directly coated onto tio2 the photocurrent density increased slightly with the introduction of pda the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode yielded the highest photocurrent density of 0 36 ma cm2 similarly the photo current response results showed the same trend the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode yielded the highest current density during the light on period as shown in fig 5b such behaviors could be well repeated in the tested five cycles demonstrating that the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode cannot only possess excellent photoelectrochemical activity but also exhibit good photo response the electrostatic interaction of pda is beneficial for the preparation of the composite photoanode compared with the tio2 no pda g c3n4 photoanode the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode can effectively promote charge transfer due to the increased adhesion and adsorption of the protonated g c3n4 nanosheets on the other hand the additional porous structure can be formed by pda particles in the calcination process which enhances the light scattering and mass transfer inside the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode as a consequence the enhanced electron hole separation light scattering and mass transfer are together responsible for promoting the photoelectrochemical activity of the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode in addition we also used methylene blue mb as a pollutant to characterize the degradation performances of these photoanodes in this three electrode system because the mb contained wastewater widely existed in the textile industries the photoanodes were operated at an applied potential 0 5 v vs ag agcl the other conditions included the light intensity of 100 mw cm2 the mb concentration of 3 10 5 m the koh concentration of 0 5 m the degradation efficiencies of the g c3n4 tio2 and tio2 photoanodes are shown in fig 5c both the photoanodes showed a reduction in the mb concentration upon illumination as compared to the tio2 photoanode the mb degradation efficiency was improved with the g c3n4 tio2 photoanode moreover the newly developed g c3n4 tio2 photoanode exhibited a higher degradation rate as a result of the enhanced photoelectrohemical activity as seen the degradation efficiency of mb for the tio2 photoanode was only 72 7 in 20 min while it was improved to 87 2 for the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode in the same time interval this result further confirms that the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode prepared with polydopamine inspiration has excellent photoelectrochemical activity towards pollutant degradation furthermore a single chamber pfc was constructed by integrating the as prepared photoanodes with the air breathing pt c cathode to evaluate the performance of these photoanodes the pfc could generate electricity during the mineralization of methanol therefore the evaluation was made in terms of electricity generation here the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode prepared with the adsorption time of 1 h was chosen in this demonstration the discharging current voltage curves for the different photoanodes are shown in fig 6a the short circuit current density j sc was about 0 36 ma cm2 and the open circuit voltage v oc was approximately 1 16 v when using the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode under the same conditions the j sc of pfc using the tio2 no pda g c3n4 and tio2 photoanodes were only 0 28 ma cm2 and 0 26 ma cm2 respectively the use of the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode significantly increased the maximum power density p max of a pfc shown in fig 6b compared with the tio2 photoanode 0 125 mw cm2 and the tio2 no pda g c3n4 photoanode 0 196 mw cm2 the p max increased by 70 4 and 8 7 for the pfc with the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode 0 213 mw cm2 as mentioned above this improvement may be caused by two main reasons more protonated g c3n4 nanosheets could be adsorbed on the tio2 surface and the adhesion between them could be enhanced via electrostatic interaction during the preparation process which could effectively enhance the formation of the heterojunction and thereby the charge transfer on the other hand the formation of plenty of pores during the calcination process could enhance light scattering and mass transport in a word the use of pda for preparing the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode is a feasible way to enhance the photoanode performance 3 2 effect of adsorption time of protonated g c3n4 nanosheets the above results indicated that the tio2 g c3n4 heterojunction successfully enhanced the photoanode performance however the recombination of photo excited electrons and holes in protonated g c3n4 nanosheets was more serious than tio2 see fig 4a therefore although the use of pda can enhance the adsorption of protonated g c3n4 nanosheets too many protonated g c3n4 nanosheets may be negative to the photoanode performance which highly depends on the adsorption time therefore the tio2 g c3n4 photoanodes prepared with different adsorption times of the protonated g c3n4 nanosheets including 1 h 2 h and 3 h were compared the pl emission peak of this type photoanode became larger with increasing the adsorption time from 1 h to 3 h fig 7a with the extension of the adsorption time more protonated g c3n4 nanosheets were adsorbed on tio2 however the recombination also became more serious therefore it can be inferred that an excessive adsorption amount of protonated g c3n4 nanosheets may not be helpful for improving the performance of this type photoanode and the optimum adsorption time was 1 h this point can also be verified by the eis results shown in fig 7b as seen the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode prepared with the adsorption time of 1 h displayed the smallest impedance implying the lowest charge transfer resistance fig 7c and d present the discharging current voltage j v and current power j p curves respectively the photoanodes prepared with different adsorption times showed almost the same open circuit voltage of about 1 16 v however when the adsorption time increased from 1 h to 3 h the j sc decreased from 0 36 to 0 31 ma cm2 meanwhile the maximum power density p max showed a similar trend the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode prepared with the adsorption time of 1 h yielded the optimal p max of 0 213 mw cm2 all these results indicate that the selection of proper adsorption time is conducive to the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode prepared with the assistance of pda 4 conclusions in this work a facile polydopamine inspired strategy was proposed for the preparation of the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode used in photocatalytic fuel cells to enable simultaneous organic pollutant degradation and electricity generation the incorporation of protonated g c3n4 nanosheets into tio2 made the photoanode visible light responsive polydopamine could make more protonated g c3n4 nanosheets firmly adsorb on tio2 via electrostatic interaction which promoted the formation of the heterojunction and thereby the charge transfer moreover plenty of micropores could be formed after polydopamine removal by high temperature calcination which facilitated light scattering and mass transfer as a result the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode prepared with polydopamine inspiration yielded better performance it was also revealed that the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode prepared with an adsorption time of 1 h exhibited optimal performance too large adsorption time resulted in excessive protonated g c3n4 nanosheets being adsorbed leading to more serious recombination although promising there are still some challenges to be overcome for example the composition of actual wastewater is much more complex the adaptability of this type photoanode to actual wastewater but not limited to methanol and mb contained wastewater needs to be further studied how to massively prepare such a photoanode by the proposed method is also a challenge development of high performance photoanode will promote the application of the photocatalytic fuel cell technology into wastewater treatment industries declaration

rpm for 10 min and 10 000 rpm for 10 min subsequently to achieve g c3n4 nanosheets finally 0 06 g g c3n4 nanosheets were ultrasonically suspended in 60 ml hcl solution for 5 h before being centrifuged at 10000 rpm to obtain the suspension the suspension was cleaned until the solution became neutral the protonated g c3n4 nanosheets were then obtained after the solution was dried 2 2 preparation of photoanode fig 1 illustrates the process of the pda inspired preparation of the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode firstly the fto conductive glass zhuhai kaivo optoelectronic technology co ltd which was used as the substrate for coating the photocatalysts was ultrasonically washed in acetone ethanol and deionized water subsequently before being dried at 60 c commercial tio2 nanoparticles aeroxide p25 acros belgium were used to prepare tio2 sol which was sprayed onto the cleaned fto conductive glass by the wet spraying method and the loading of tio2 was controlled at 1 0 mg cm2 the photoanode composed of only tio2 was prepared by calcination at 400 c for 0 5 h such a photoanode is simply termed as the tio2 photoanode the tio2 photoanode was immersed in the prepared solution containing dopamine hydrochloride 98 sigma aldrich with a concentration of 0 05 mg ml for 0 5 h and in tris for 3 h by doing this plenty of pda particles were formed on the tio2 surface followed by rinsing with deionized water which was denoted as the tio2 pda photoanode the tio2 pda photoanode was then immersed in the prepared suspension containing 1 0 mg ml protonated g c3n4 for 1 h after the soaking and adsorption the protonated g c3n4 nanosheets were adsorbed onto the tio2 pda photoanode followed by drying at 60 c finally these pda particles were removed by calcination at 450 c with a temperature ramp of 5 c min for 2 h to form the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode for comparison a photoanode was prepared by directly coating the protonated g c3n4 nanosheets onto the tio2 without adding pda between them before calcination which was termed as the tio2 no pda g c3n4 photoanode the amount of the protonated g c3n4 nanosheets in the photoanode could be adjusted by controlling the adsorption time in the prepared suspension containing 1 0 mg ml protonated g c3n4 nanosheets in this work the adsorption time was 1 0 h 2 0 h and 3 0 h respectively the larger the adsorption time the larger the amount of the adsorbed protonated g c3n4 nanosheets 2 3 characterizations the microscopic morphologies of the prepared photoanodes were investigated employing scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi su8020 the phase compositions of the photoanodes were monitored via x ray diffraction xrd brucker d8 advance over a diffraction angle 2θ range of 10 90 the chemical valences of elements ti and n in the photoanodes were analyzed utilizing x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermal escalab 250xi and the xps spectra were normalized with the adventitious carbon c1s at a binding energy of 284 8 ev 38 the uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra uv vis drs shimadzu uv3600 were used to determine the light absorption range of the photoanode in a range of 200 800 nm the separation of photo generated carriers was characterized by photoluminescence spectroscopy pl edinburgh instruments fls1000 photoelectrochemical activities of these photoanodes were characterized using a three electrode system the as prepared photoanode pt foil and ag agcl were served as the working electrode the counter electrode and the reference electrode respectively the electrolyte was composed of 1 0 m koh and 0 5 m ch3oh a xe lamp cel hxf300 china with an am 1 5 g filter was chosen for illumination and the density of simulated light was fixed at 100 mw cm2 measured by a photo radio meter cel fz a the linear sweep voltammetry lsv electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis and photo current response i t of the prepared photoanodes were tested employing an electrochemical workstation zahner elektrik gmbh cokg germany in addition to the use of methanol as a model pollutant we also used methylene blue as a pollutant to characterize the degradation efficiency of these photoanodes the mb concentration was determined from the absorption spectrum using a uv vis spectrophotometer tu 1950 persee china at a wavelength of 664 nm 2 4 construction and evaluation of pfc the pfc consisted of a chamber in the middle the prepared photoanode 1 0 cm 1 0 cm and the air breathing cathode the air breathing cathode was prepared by loading pt black on carbon paper with the same surface area as the photoanode the electrolyte and light source were similar to the case of the photoelectrochemical activity characterization the liquid flow rate was maintained at 200 μl min by a pump lsp04 1a longer china in the evaluation of the pfc performance methanol is chosen as a model pollutant because methanol contained wastewater widely exists not only in methanol synthesis but also in pharmaceutical petrochemical and paper industries etc 39 40 moreover methanol is the simplest alcohol whose intermediates can be effectively mineralized 41 as a result the methanol contained wastewater treatment performance can be reflected by the discharging performance of the pfc the better the discharging performance the better the degradation performance here the performance of pfc was monitored by an electronic load system ct 3008 neware technology ltd china in terms of discharging current voltage curve j v current power curve j p open circuit voltage v oc short circuit current density j sc and maximum power density p max all experiments were repeated at least three times to achieve creditable data 3 results and discussion 3 1 photoanode characterization the microscopic morphologies of the bulk g c3n4 protonated g c3n4 nanosheets tio2 tio2 pda coating of pda onto tio2 tio2 g c3n4 coating protonated g c3n4 onto tio2 assisted by pda adsorption time 1 h and tio2 no pda g c3n4 direct coating of protonated g c3n4 nanosheets onto tio2 without using pda photoanodes were indicated generally the bulk g c3n4 formed by calcination of melamine showed a typically mixed aggregated morphology with flake and bulk structures fig 2a and the sizes mainly fell in a few microns which was consistent with previous studies 37 the surface of the protonated g c3n4 nanosheets was rougher and more surface was exposed than the bulk g c3n4 fig 2b because the van der waals force between g c3n4 layers was destroyed under strong acid condition and sonication treatment 42 the protonated g c3n4 nanosheets can promote the photoresponse due to the size reduction and the change of the microscopic surface 43 in addition the comparison between fig 2c and d confirmed the presence of the pda particles which were uniformly distributed on the tio2 surface these pda particles could form a vigorous porous structure after calcination 27 which facilitated light scattering and mass transport inside the photoanode besides the pda particles also provided more sites for adsorbing the protonated g c3n4 nanosheets by electrostatic interaction therefore the protonated g c3n4 nanosheets could be more efficiently and firmly adsorbed on the pda surface by comparing fig 2e and f the zeta potentials of each component can be used to reflect their electrostatic interactions as shown in fig 2g the zeta potential of protonated g c3n4 nanosheets was changed positively to 19 8 mv because of the acidification treatment 44 while that of bulk g c3n4 was still negative 23 0 ev because the zeta potential of pda was approximately 22 3 mv 45 the protonated g c3n4 nanosheets could be efficiently adsorbed onto the pda via electrostatic interaction these results indicate the use of pda is beneficial for the preparation of the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode the phase structure of the protonated g c3n4 tio2 and tio2 g c3n4 were characterized as shown in fig 2h there existed a peak at 2θ 27 4 for the protonated g c3n4 nanosheets representing the graphitized crystalline surface due to the stacking of the conjugated aromatic system which was in agreement with the open literature 46 by contrast with respect to bulk g c3n4 the absence of a distinctive peak at 2θ 13 3 indicated successful protonation of g c3n4 as for the tio2 and tio2 g c3n4 photoanodes both of them exhibited characteristic diffraction peaks corresponding to the anatase phase and rutile phase of tio2 at the same position in fig 2h which indicated that the crystal morphology of tio2 in the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode was not affected by the deposition of the protonated g c3n4 nanosheets meanwhile the inserted xrd results indicated a negative shift of a peak at 2θ 27 4 for the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode relative to tio2 in virtue of the deposition of the protonated g c3n4 nanosheets furthermore we conducted the xps tests on the tio2 g c3n4 and tio2 photoanodes to obtain the chemical compositions and states of various elements ti and n given in fig 3a and b for pure tio2 the two peaks at 458 6 ev and 464 4 ev in ti 2p spectra confirmed the electronic state of ti4 however no peak at 392 408 ev was observed in the deconvolution of n 1s spectra for the tio2 photoanode but it could be observed for the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode besides the presence of protonated g c3n4 nanosheets and charge transfer caused the peak shift for the ti 2p spectrum of the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode 47 high resolution xps spectrum for the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode demonstrated that the binding energy of ti 2p shifted to low energy region and the n 1s spectrum of the photoanode could be deconvoluted into three constituent peaks at the binding energies of 398 6 ev 400 1 ev and 401 1 ev respectively the differences in the n 1s spectrum between tio2 and tio2 g c3n4 was a result of different forms of n the sp2 hybridized nitrogen cnc the sp3 hybridized nitrogen n c 3 and amino functional group cnh 48 in addition the xps valence band spectra of the samples were also determined as seen in fig 3c the valence band evb of pure tio2 was 2 87 ev but the evb of tio2 g c3n4 was reduced to 2 71 ev clearly the addition of the protonated g c3n4 nanosheets with the evb of 1 78 ev was beneficial for the reduction in the valence band of the prepared photoanode the uv vis drs testing results are shown in fig 3d pure tio2 presented ultraviolet light absorption with an absorbing edge of approximately 400 nm because the protonated g c3n4 nanosheets showed visible light response the light absorption edge of tio2 g c3n4 was extended to about 430 nm the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode showed stronger absorbance in both the ultraviolet and visible light regions than tio2 which can be attributed to the formation of heterojunction the band gap was estimated by the kubelka munk equation 49 the band gaps of the protonated g c3n4 and tio2 were 2 72 ev and 3 17 ev respectively while their combination led to a band gap of 3 05 ev inserted figure in fig 3d the energy band was lowered and the visible light response was enabled due to the formation of heterojunction furthermore the conduction bands ecb of the protonated g c3n4 nanosheets and tio2 were also obtained which were 0 94 ev and 0 29 ev respectively the performance of the photoanode is greatly affected by the separation of electrons and holes and photocarrier migration therefore the photoluminescence spectroscopy was characterized in the present study fig 4a compares the pl spectra of various photoanodes including the tio2 protonated g c3n4 tio2 no pda g c3n4 and tio2 g c3n4 photoanodes it could be found that although the protonated g c3n4 had a small band gap to absorb more solar energy the recombination of photo generated carriers was rather serious leading to an extremely high peak which was even higher than tio2 the coupling of the protonated g c3n4 and tio2 decreased the pl emission peak particularly the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode with their adhesion enhanced by pda showed a much smaller pl emission peak than did the tio2 no pda g c3n4 photoanode indicating a higher electron hole separation efficiency this is because the use of pda enhanced the adsorption between tio2 and protonated g c3n4 nanosheets which was in favor of forming the heterojunction as a result the charge transfer was accelerated to inhibit the recombination to further confirm this point the eis measurements were performed for these photoanodes as shown in fig 4b the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode displayed the smallest impedance indicating the lowest charge transfer resistance although the tio2 no pda g c3n4 photoanode prepared by direct adsorption showed larger charge transfer resistance than the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode it was still smaller than the pure tio2 and protonated g c3n4 photoanodes which were consistent with the pl results according to the above results it can be concluded that the photoanode prepared with pda inspiration shows enhanced adsorption and adhesion between tio2 and protonated g c3n4 nanosheets thereby facilitating the charge transfer and inhibiting the recombination in addition to evaluating the electron hole separation in terms of pl and eis we also characterized the photoelectrochemical activities and photo current responses of these photoanodes in a three electrode system the photocurrent density of pure tio2 photoanode was 0 26 ma cm2 at an applied voltage of 0 2 v vs ag agcl fig 5a which was lower than other photoanodes when the protonated g c3n4 nanosheets were directly coated onto tio2 the photocurrent density increased slightly with the introduction of pda the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode yielded the highest photocurrent density of 0 36 ma cm2 similarly the photo current response results showed the same trend the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode yielded the highest current density during the light on period as shown in fig 5b such behaviors could be well repeated in the tested five cycles demonstrating that the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode cannot only possess excellent photoelectrochemical activity but also exhibit good photo response the electrostatic interaction of pda is beneficial for the preparation of the composite photoanode compared with the tio2 no pda g c3n4 photoanode the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode can effectively promote charge transfer due to the increased adhesion and adsorption of the protonated g c3n4 nanosheets on the other hand the additional porous structure can be formed by pda particles in the calcination process which enhances the light scattering and mass transfer inside the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode as a consequence the enhanced electron hole separation light scattering and mass transfer are together responsible for promoting the photoelectrochemical activity of the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode in addition we also used methylene blue mb as a pollutant to characterize the degradation performances of these photoanodes in this three electrode system because the mb contained wastewater widely existed in the textile industries the photoanodes were operated at an applied potential 0 5 v vs ag agcl the other conditions included the light intensity of 100 mw cm2 the mb concentration of 3 10 5 m the koh concentration of 0 5 m the degradation efficiencies of the g c3n4 tio2 and tio2 photoanodes are shown in fig 5c both the photoanodes showed a reduction in the mb concentration upon illumination as compared to the tio2 photoanode the mb degradation efficiency was improved with the g c3n4 tio2 photoanode moreover the newly developed g c3n4 tio2 photoanode exhibited a higher degradation rate as a result of the enhanced photoelectrohemical activity as seen the degradation efficiency of mb for the tio2 photoanode was only 72 7 in 20 min while it was improved to 87 2 for the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode in the same time interval this result further confirms that the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode prepared with polydopamine inspiration has excellent photoelectrochemical activity towards pollutant degradation furthermore a single chamber pfc was constructed by integrating the as prepared photoanodes with the air breathing pt c cathode to evaluate the performance of these photoanodes the pfc could generate electricity during the mineralization of methanol therefore the evaluation was made in terms of electricity generation here the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode prepared with the adsorption time of 1 h was chosen in this demonstration the discharging current voltage curves for the different photoanodes are shown in fig 6a the short circuit current density j sc was about 0 36 ma cm2 and the open circuit voltage v oc was approximately 1 16 v when using the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode under the same conditions the j sc of pfc using the tio2 no pda g c3n4 and tio2 photoanodes were only 0 28 ma cm2 and 0 26 ma cm2 respectively the use of the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode significantly increased the maximum power density p max of a pfc shown in fig 6b compared with the tio2 photoanode 0 125 mw cm2 and the tio2 no pda g c3n4 photoanode 0 196 mw cm2 the p max increased by 70 4 and 8 7 for the pfc with the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode 0 213 mw cm2 as mentioned above this improvement may be caused by two main reasons more protonated g c3n4 nanosheets could be adsorbed on the tio2 surface and the adhesion between them could be enhanced via electrostatic interaction during the preparation process which could effectively enhance the formation of the heterojunction and thereby the charge transfer on the other hand the formation of plenty of pores during the calcination process could enhance light scattering and mass transport in a word the use of pda for preparing the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode is a feasible way to enhance the photoanode performance 3 2 effect of adsorption time of protonated g c3n4 nanosheets the above results indicated that the tio2 g c3n4 heterojunction successfully enhanced the photoanode performance however the recombination of photo excited electrons and holes in protonated g c3n4 nanosheets was more serious than tio2 see fig 4a therefore although the use of pda can enhance the adsorption of protonated g c3n4 nanosheets too many protonated g c3n4 nanosheets may be negative to the photoanode performance which highly depends on the adsorption time therefore the tio2 g c3n4 photoanodes prepared with different adsorption times of the protonated g c3n4 nanosheets including 1 h 2 h and 3 h were compared the pl emission peak of this type photoanode became larger with increasing the adsorption time from 1 h to 3 h fig 7a with the extension of the adsorption time more protonated g c3n4 nanosheets were adsorbed on tio2 however the recombination also became more serious therefore it can be inferred that an excessive adsorption amount of protonated g c3n4 nanosheets may not be helpful for improving the performance of this type photoanode and the optimum adsorption time was 1 h this point can also be verified by the eis results shown in fig 7b as seen the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode prepared with the adsorption time of 1 h displayed the smallest impedance implying the lowest charge transfer resistance fig 7c and d present the discharging current voltage j v and current power j p curves respectively the photoanodes prepared with different adsorption times showed almost the same open circuit voltage of about 1 16 v however when the adsorption time increased from 1 h to 3 h the j sc decreased from 0 36 to 0 31 ma cm2 meanwhile the maximum power density p max showed a similar trend the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode prepared with the adsorption time of 1 h yielded the optimal p max of 0 213 mw cm2 all these results indicate that the selection of proper adsorption time is conducive to the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode prepared with the assistance of pda 4 conclusions in this work a facile polydopamine inspired strategy was proposed for the preparation of the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode used in photocatalytic fuel cells to enable simultaneous organic pollutant degradation and electricity generation the incorporation of protonated g c3n4 nanosheets into tio2 made the photoanode visible light responsive polydopamine could make more protonated g c3n4 nanosheets firmly adsorb on tio2 via electrostatic interaction which promoted the formation of the heterojunction and thereby the charge transfer moreover plenty of micropores could be formed after polydopamine removal by high temperature calcination which facilitated light scattering and mass transfer as a result the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode prepared with polydopamine inspiration yielded better performance it was also revealed that the tio2 g c3n4 photoanode prepared with an adsorption time of 1 h exhibited optimal performance too large adsorption time resulted in excessive protonated g c3n4 nanosheets being adsorbed leading to more serious recombination although promising there are still some challenges to be overcome for example the composition of actual wastewater is much more complex the adaptability of this type photoanode to actual wastewater but not limited to methanol and mb contained wastewater needs to be further studied how to massively prepare such a photoanode by the proposed method is also a challenge development of high performance photoanode will promote the application of the photocatalytic fuel cell technology into wastewater treatment industries declaration

12583,the discharge of oily wastewater into the environment adversely impacts the ecosystem and human health due to the existence of toxic and carcinogenic compounds in oil to decrease the destructive environmental impacts membrane filtration technology has been used because it can remove emulsified oil with droplet sizes ranging from 1 to 10 μm which is a challenging issue for other types of treatment methods in this research a comprehensive 3d cfd model was developed to investigate the oily wastewater treatment process in a pilot scale membrane filtration system the model was validated using available data in experimental runs such as oil removal efficiency and average transmembrane pressure tmp for two types of oily wastewater containing heavy and light crude oils following that the hydrodynamic condition of the pilot scale unit was analyzed which is difficult to be investigated in a real condition the impacts of inlet oil concentration permeate and aeration flow rates on permeate oil concentration and tmp were also evaluated results revealed when the inlet oil concentration was at the threshold of 270 and 330 mg l containing heavy and light crude oil respectively the system met the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships marpol 73 78 regulation additionally the model was capable of predicting tmp changes under constant flux finally the validated model was used to upscale the pilot scale system to achieve a permeate production rate of 10 000 l h for larger capacities based on the results the oil removal efficiency was above 88 in pilot and upscaled systems graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords oily wastewater pilot scale system membrane filtration navier stokes equation mass transport data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the term oily wastewater is applied to all types of water containing various quantities of oil and grease as well as different types of suspended materials and other dissolved colloidal substances 1 oily wastewater is carcinogenic and toxic which has deleterious effects on the ecosystem and human health 2 3 it is generated from different sources and one major part of oily wastewater is associated with marine oil spill incidents 2 the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships marpol 73 78 set regulatory limits on the maximum oil concentration in oily wastewater discharge to be less than 15 mg l 4 various physical treatment methods such as gravity separation and dissolved air flotation daf have been employed to treat oily wastewater however they have several disadvantages such as prolonged processes large space requirements high energy consumption and low treatment efficacy chemical treatment methods such as coagulation and flocculation consume toxic compounds have high chemical costs and generate secondary pollutants 5 therefore the focus of studies has shifted to membrane filtration technology which has been proven to be the most effective technique to treat oily wastewater particularly because of the capability to remove oil droplet sizes ranging from 1 to 10 μm 3 6 this technology is a physical separation technique using a selectivity mechanism to eliminate particles and organics from wastewater which generates excellent permeate quality and low waste 7 10 the operation and maintenance of the membrane filtration system are simple and in contrast with biological based technologies changes in environmental parameters such as feed composition and oxygen level do not affect this type of filtration process 3 11 low requirement of chemical additives and small footprint are other benefits of membrane technologies in wastewater treatment processes 9 12 13 besides the advantages membrane fouling is an inevitable challenge reducing membrane flux membrane lifespan and consequently membrane performance 14 16 to improve the applicability of the membrane technology different types of studies were conducted numerical studies show that computational fluid dynamics cfd is a useful tool that can provide a comprehensive investigation of the membrane filtration process in terms of simulating fluid hydrodynamics modeling mass transfer predicting membrane fouling and investigating treatment process and scale up in different module scales 17 20 the method includes solving the navier stokes and continuity equations for a two dimensional 2d or three dimensional 3d steady laminar flow of an incompressible homogeneous and newtonian fluid with the highest precision 21 darcy equation was used to link the free flow model using the navier stokes equations to the flow that passed through the membrane for the first time in 1998 22 following that studies utilized cfd to provide an insight into the phenomena taking place inside membrane modules 23 30 and to enhance the whole performance of this technology 31 34 in addition several numerical studies have been conducted to simulate the membrane filtration technology for treatment purposes 35 39 most of the previous numerical studies have been focused to investigate the performance of the membrane technology to treat various types of wastewater at bench scale systems under the constant tmp using a 2d cfd model 26 40 and few numerical studies have been conducted to evaluate oil removal efficacy in a pilot and or large scale membrane filtration system operating under the constant flux using a 3d cfd model 41 42 in realistic circumstances conducting experimental runs with pilot and or large scale systems have different challenges and difficulties in terms of controlling experimental conditions and high cost of construction and fabrication of the system providing membranes pumps and air blowers hence researchers do not have broad access to the pilot and or large scale systems in laboratories and model validation using pilot scale experimental data has been restricted additionally operating a large scale membrane filtration system under the constant tmp results in a serious membrane fouling 43 since solute particles move toward the membrane surface more quickly than they are transported away causing more particles to be collected on the surface of the membrane at the constant tmp in comparison with the constant flux therefore simulation and operation of a membrane filtration system under constant flux conditions is more advantageous for industrial applications owing to a stable permeate production rate with negligible membrane fouling and the simplicity of the membrane cleaning 43 44 most of the previous numerical studies evaluated the effects of turbulency promoter methods such as gas sparging baffles and spacers in bench scale membrane filtration systems 45 49 however these studies did not analyze the effect of aeration on membrane fouling and did not evaluate the hydrodynamic behavior of a pilot scale membrane filtration system containing various types of oily wastewater with heavy and light crude oils to the best of the authors knowledge so far a comprehensive cfd model for a pilot scale membrane filtration system with the aim of oily wastewater treatment by considering involved multiphysics processes inside the system such as bubbly flow simultaneous mass transfer in the retentate and the porous membrane modules as well as membrane fouling consideration has not been investigated in the present work to address the mentioned knowledge gaps a comprehensive time dependent and 3d cfd model was developed for a pilot scale system to treat oily wastewater samples containing heavy crude oil cold lake dilbit cld and light crude oil very low sulfur fuel oil vlsfo under constant flux the model was validated based on available experimental data and after that the hydrodynamic behavior of the pilot scale unit and the impacts of various effective operational parameters on the permeate oil concentration and tmp have been studied finally to investigate the capability of the model for larger capacities the pilot scale system was upscaled to explore its potential as an onsite treatment technology for oil spill response operations this modeling approach can help decrease the adverse environmental impacts of oil spills by simulating a membrane filtration process it also provides scientific aid for decision making in oil spill response operations by increasing the capacity and improving the efficiency of the oil spill response operation 2 experimental setup the pilot scale membrane filtration system is shown in fig 1 which consists of a membrane tank with a dimension of 1 525 0 564 0 4 m h l w and two hydrophilic polytetrafluoroethylenes ptfe hollow fiber hf membrane modules 44 oily wastewater is pumped to a membrane tank with a flow rate of 1500 l h air gas phase is supplied through aerators located at the bottom of the membrane tank operational parameters are listed in table 1 the oil concentration was measured using an ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrometry 50 tmp was monitored and recorded using a programmable logic controller plc every minute for each experimental run 3 theoretical descriptions a 3d cfd model for a hydrophilic hf ultrafiltration uf membrane filtration system treating oily wastewater was developed using comsol multiphysics version 6 comsol inc the procedures of model development are described in the following sections 3 1 model geometry the 3d cfd model was developed and the elements of the model geometry are shown in fig 2 the computational region has a rectangular geometry with an actual dimension of the membrane tank mentioned in section 2 aerators are located under each membrane module to provide air bubbles in the membrane tank the feed solution in the membrane tank was assumed to be well mixed and the concentration viscosity and density were considered constant the differential pressure among the membranes did not cause any changes in the physical characteristics of the membranes flow through the membrane tank and inside porous membranes was assumed laminar and incompressible the liquid was assumed to be a newtonian fluid due to the low concentration of oil the relation between shear stress and the rate of deformation in newtonian fluids is expressed as eq 1 1 τ μ d du x dy where τ is the shear stress pa μ d is the dynamic viscosity pa s and du x dy is the shear rate 1 s 51 in this study the shear rate at the membrane surface was measured by cfd the pore structure of the membrane support was assumed to be homogeneous 3 2 geometrical and operational parameters geometrical and operational parameters are specified in the model for the treatment process in the membrane tank characteristics of crude oils are reported in table 2 based on the experiments and previous studies 52 57 the properties of oily wastewater are given in table 3 the length width and height of each membrane module are 0 16 0 14 1 295 m respectively the packing of fibers in each hf membrane was assumed to be a porous membrane module 58 59 table 4 demonstrates the membrane characteristics which are used in the simulation 3 3 modeling of fluid flow in the membrane tank the fluid velocity field is investigated to understand the concentration profiles in the membrane tank and membranes in this model the navier stokes equation was utilized for the liquid phase to govern the flow of oily wastewater in the membrane tank 60 62 and bubble velocity was explained by a slip model to obtain the volume fraction of bubbles a transport equation associated with the effective gas density was solved momentum and continuity equations for the liquid phase are shown in eqs 2 and 3 respectively eq 4 shows a transport equation for the gas volume fraction where m gl

diameter is 4 mm and therefore the drag coefficient c d is solved by eq 7 which is according to sokolichin eigenberger and lapin model 65 66 the surface tension is insignificant since the radius of

equations and boundary conditions are shown in table 7 3 6 upscaling upscaling is used to designate the systematic transferring of information from a specific scale level to a superior one 73 when the model of the current pilot scale system was validated it was utilized to upscale the oily wastewater membrane filtration system therefore according to the ratio between the target permeate production rate field throughput and the maximum throughput of the current system an upscaling index was obtained the parameters and equations that were used in comsol multiphysics 6 to upscale the model are shown in table 1a in the supplementary material section throughout scale up based on the difference in the rate of permeate production the volume of the membrane tank and the number of membrane modules and aerators were changed and simulated with the validated model according to the upscaling index the number of units was recalculated and the feed inlets and outlets in terms of the number of units and location were designed fig 3a b shows the upscaled system containing 42 units and 84 membranes from the side and top views this system has a dimension of 1 525 2 204 1 936 m h l w to achieve an upscaled 3d model the mentioned assumptions in section 3 1 were used governing equations for both the membrane tank and membrane module were the same 3 7 solution methodology in this modeling approach governing equations were solved by comsol multiphysics 6 using the finite element method fem to obtain the liquid and gas velocity distribution in the membrane tank the two phase fluid flow module was used this study was initially conducted in an unsteady state condition for a fluid flow module in the membrane tank to investigate the hydrodynamics of the system fluid flow in the membrane tank reached a steady state at a short simulation time based on the results from different cfd runs therefore the fluid flow module was solved at a steady state to investigate the operational parameters on permeate oil concentration and tmp to reduce computation time the obtained velocity from this module was utilized in the module of mass transfer the velocity of the fluid in the membrane was calculated by darcy s law in the membrane module and the obtained velocity was applied in the porous media mass transfer module after integrating three modules in three dimensions the mass transfer module was solved in a time dependent model to calculate the permeate oil concentration 3 8 model validation and verification 3 8 1 mesh independence analysis free tetrahedral geometry mesh configuration was utilized in this model 74 and a grid independence study was performed to estimate the optimum simulation grid size for the simulation domain and check the accuracy of the results and save computation time and cost 71 the permeate oil concentration was investigated for various grid sizes and used as a criterion to check mesh independency it was compared to the permeate oil concentration achieved by experiments which are shown in table 8 a qualitative representation of the generated mesh for membrane tank simulation with hp core i7 3 4ghz cpu and 16 gb of ram is shown in fig 4 the results of this study were obtained using a computational mesh for fluid dynamics with 396 364 domain elements this mesh generated less than 2 average error in the results compared to finer meshes 476 414 domain elements which was sufficiently accurate 3 8 2 numerical model validation a criterion for model validation using relative error re is expressed by eq 15 15 re e oil removal exp e oil removal model e oil removal exp 100 where e oil removal exp is oil removal efficiency obtained by the experiments and e oil removal model is oil removal efficiency achieved by the model also average tmp was examined during the experimental runs and compared with simulation results as measured by eq 16 16 re tmp exp tmp model tmp exp 100 where tmp exp is the average tmp obtained by experiments and tmp model is the average tmp obtained by the model the results in table 9 for permeate oil concentration and average tmp indicate that the modeling results have a good agreement with experimental results at different operating conditions with the oily wastewater containing cld and vlsfo with an average relative error of less than 5 therefore the cfd model is reliable and can use for system parametric study and scale up in addition the verification of the model was fulfilled with the experimental results 4 results and discussion 4 1 analysis of the system hydrodynamics 4 1 1 influence of the aeration flow rate on gas volume fraction using aeration leads to decrease membrane fouling and increase permeate volume production and therefore enhances the performance of the membrane filtration system 75 76 in this simulation study aeration flow rates ranged from 4 8 6 to 6 8 m3 h and were investigated for two types of oily wastewater fig 5a b shows the changes in gas volume fraction at three aeration flow rates in a system containing cld and vlsfo respectively gas entered the membrane tank from the aerators and the profile grew and remained steady over time 64 fig 5a shows when the system contained 100 mg l of cld at the aeration flow rate and permeate flow rate of 4 8 m3 h and 72 l h respectively the gas volume fraction reached 2 50 at 25 s and then had a stable condition while for vlsfo the fraction reached 2 52 at 25 s when the aeration flow rate and permeate flow rate were 6 m3 h and 72 l h respectively after 35 s the gas volume fraction reached 3 68 and became steady whereas for vlsfo the gas volume fraction was 3 8 after 35 s at an aeration flow rate of 6 8 m3 h and the same permeate flow rate after 60 s the gas volume fraction was 5 4 and became stable while for vlsfo the gas volume fraction reached 5 6 after 60 s and it became steady after 67 2 s results showed that increasing the aeration flow rate increased gas volume fraction in two types of oily wastewater 77 the insignificant difference in gas volume fractions was due to the negligible difference in viscosity and drag force of the two types of wastewater based on a previous study when the liquid viscosity is less than 0 01 pa s bubble breakup rate and gas volume fraction are negligibly affected by viscosity 78 which is verified by the results of the present study 4 1 2 influence of the aeration flow rate on gas and liquid velocities fig 6a c demonstrates the liquid velocity arrow plots as a function of aeration flow rate at three aeration flow rates when the filtration system contained 100 mg l of cld with a permeate flow rate of 72 l h the color of the arrow plots indicated the gas velocity quantity in various zones of the membrane tank gas velocity close to the walls of the membrane tank was 1 m s which was the lowest the reason is associated with the large bubbles inside the membrane tank jiang et al 79 showed that large bubbles tended to move toward the middle part of the tank which was related to the lift force impact while the gas velocity at the bottom side of the membrane tank close to air spargers was between 3 5 and 5 5 m s which was the highest gas velocity at the surface of the membrane tank was between 2 and 3 m s where the gas was exiting the tank fig 6a c shows that a circulating fluid flow with larger arrows was developed when the aeration flow rate increased from 4 8 to 6 8 m3 h the whole fluid domain was shown as a downward circulating flow region in the central domain above the air spargers and the regions near the walls of the membrane tank previous studies similarly concluded that as the gas flow rate increases the system tends to more unsteady state conditions and most of the bubbles are moved forcefully to the middle of the tank the down flow of liquid near the walls was confirmed by bubbles flowing down and kept almost stationary in that area 80 82 the treatment system containing vlsfo showed similar results fig 7a b shows the changes in liquid velocities with time at different aeration flow rates when the filtration system contained 100 mg l of cld with a permeate flow rate of 72 l h liquid velocities were obtained at about 0 81 1 06 and 1 81 m s for aeration flow rates of 4 8 6 and 6 8 m3 h at 15 25 and 28 s respectively shown in fig 7a furthermore fig 7b shows when oily wastewater contained 100 mg l of vlsfo at the same permeate flow rate liquid velocities were 0 83 1 09 and 1 87 m s for aeration flow rates of 4 8 6 and 6 8 m3 h at 15 25 and 28 s respectively results confirmed that the liquid velocity condition and its quantity were not significantly altered by changing the type of oil since the concentration of oil was in a low range and the impact of oil viscosity was negligible in addition liquid velocity in two types of oil increased when the aeration flow rate went up because of the agitation inside the membrane tank generated by aerators 83 85 4 1 3 influence of the aeration flow rate on shear rate and shear stress of the membrane surface the major hydrodynamic technique to decrease the deposition of particles on the membrane surface is aeration 84 fig 8a c demonstrates the shear rate along the membrane surface in a system containing cld after reaching a steady state condition oil concentration and permeate flow rate were 100 mg l and 72 l h respectively and aeration flow rates were various fig 8a c shows that the shear rate ranged from 1 to 10 1 s and it decreased at a membrane height of approximately 0 5 m in the middle of the membrane surface toward the top between 4 and 8 1 s the shear rate was between 7 and 10 1 s at the top side of the membrane surface and this was because of the gas velocity which was high in this area as shown in fig 6a c as the aeration flow rate increased from 4 8 to 6 8 m3 h the shear rate was obtained higher in fig 8a compared to fig 8c and there was the same condition for vlsfo fig 9a b shows the average shear stress and shear rate on the surface of the membranes at aeration flow rates of 4 8 6 and 6 8 m3 h for two types of oily wastewater one study mentioned that liquid viscosity considerably influenced the gas liquid interfacial structure and interfacial shear stress 86 hence the minor difference in shear stress was because of the higher dynamic viscosity of the wastewater containing cld compared to that of vlsfo when the viscosity was higher in the wastewater containing cld at the same aeration flow rate and the consequent shear rate the shear stress was a little higher compared to the wastewater containing vlsfo as shown in fig 9a 4 2 influence of the aeration flow rate on tmp considering the hydrodynamic analysis increasing gas volume fraction gas velocity liquid velocity and shear rate affected the system performance when using aeration aeration increases turbulence and provides a homogenous condition for the fluid and its strong movement in the membrane tank 48 87 fig 10a b shows the impact of increasing aeration flow rate ranging from 4 8 to 6 8 m3 h on average tmp under unsteady state conditions for the system treating wastewater containing cld and vlsfo respectively permeate flow rate was 72 l h and oil concentrations were in the range of 35 to 300 mg l for two types of wastewater fig 10a b demonstrates that with an increase in aeration flow rate the average tmp decreased and the changes in tmp had mainly linear downward trends in two types of oily wastewater this reduction was due to cake layer removal from the membrane surface the impact of aeration on removing the cake layer was higher with an increase in oil concentration as shown in both figures because of increasing the mass transfer coefficient of oil in the system and improving the transfer of oil foulants from the surface of the membrane to the bulk solution comparing two figures revealed that the rate of tmp decline in vlsfo vs aeration flow rate was more than that of cld this was associated with the physical characteristics of oil including viscosity and molecular weight which were higher in heavy crude oil i e cld and therefore aeration removed the foulants of light crude oil from the membrane surface more easily previous studies such as orantes et al 88 similarly reported the advancement in performance of a membrane filtration system by increasing the aeration flow rate in their study aerators were placed under each membrane module designed to create turbulence around the membranes results of this study showed that changing the aeration flow rate from 25 to 50 l h led to decrease in tmp 4 3 influence of the inlet oil concentration on treatment efficiency and tmp fig 11a b shows the predicted permeate oil concentration and average tmp for inlet oil concentrations ranging between 30 and 390 mg l and the aeration flow rate and permeate flow rate of 4 8 m3 h and 72 l h for cld and vlsfo respectively fig 11a demonstrates that the permeate oil concentration in cld changed from 0 3132 to 42 24 mg l for an inlet oil concentration of 30 to 390 mg l and the average tmp changed in the range of 2 69 to 20 26 kpa the changes in the permeate oil concentration for vlsfo were from 0 145 to 19 564 mg l for an inlet oil concentration in the range of 30 to 390 mg l and the average tmp increased from 2 29 to 19 6 kpa as shown in fig 11b results showed that increasing inlet oil concentration to 270 mg l met marpol 73 78 regulation in the filtration system containing cld whereas in vlsfo increasing oil concentration to 330 mg l met marpol 73 78 regulation oil removal efficiency decreased from 98 96 to 89 17 for cld runs and vlsfo changed from 99 5 to 94 98 by increasing inlet oil concentration in the range of 30 to 390 mg l when oil concentration increases the number of oil droplets that interact with the membrane develops and as a result the oil droplets pass across the membrane easily and the oil removal efficiency reduces 89 an increase in the inlet oil concentration leads to the accumulation of oil on the membrane surface and into pores and consequently membrane fouling previous studies such as janknecht et al 90 reported when the inlet oil concentration in feed increased from 2 to 5 vol oil removal efficiency decreased from 99 99 to 99 98 similarly kayvani fard et al 91 concluded that when the inlet oil concentration increased from 500 to 10 000 mg l the oil removal efficiency decreased significantly from 85 to less than 60 respectively 4 4 influence of the permeate flow rate on treatment efficiency and tmp fig 12a b and fig 13a b show the permeate oil concentration and average tmp for permeate flow rates of 48 72 144 216 240 l h the aeration flow rate of 4 8 m3 h and oil concentrations of 35 50 65 80 95 110 200 300 mg l for two types of oily wastewater fig 12a and fig 13a show that with an increase in the permeate flow rate the removal efficacy reduced and this reduction was more substantial for higher oil concentrations i e 200 and 300 mg l and at higher permeate flow rates the reduction in the removal efficiency was due to greater convective movement of oil particles through the membrane since high convective transport caused high surface tension forces between water and oil hence high oil movement across the membrane led to rapid transport of oil through the membrane and consequently a lower permeate flow rate could enhance oil removal efficiency and permeate quality 6 the higher the oil concentration is in the influent the higher the oil concentration passes through the membrane when the concentration is high the hydrophilic features of the membrane cannot obstruct the oil accumulation on the membrane surface as a result of the decrease in repulsion capability of the membrane and hence removal efficiency is reduced more remarkably 91 comparing vlsfo with cld the concentration of permeate was lower than that of cld results in fig 12b and fig 13b demonstrate that average tmp increased with increasing permeate flow rate in both figures since at higher permeate flow rates pressure at two sides of the membrane went up according to darcy s law however this increase confirmed that the range of membrane flux was appropriate as the tmp did not jump and increase considerably with the increase in permeate flow rate as shown in fig 12b and fig 13b 4 5 upscaling the system fig 14a b shows the permeate oil concentration for various inlet oil concentrations of cld and vlsfo in an upscaled system this figure demonstrates that when oil concentration went up from 25 to 255 mg l the permeate oil concentration increased from 0 73 to 36 5 mg l for cld and from 0 34 to 17 15 mg l for vlsfo the upscaled system met the marpol 73 78 regulation when the inlet oil concentration was 175 mg l for cld and 235 mg l for vlsfo because the permeate oil concentrations were 14 59 and 13 81 mg l for cld and vlsfo respectively the system removal efficiency was attained above 91 for various oil concentrations showing the potential of the upscaled system to work under 10 000 l h and treat oily wastewater containing cld and vlsfo the obtained results confirmed that the system performance was influenced by expanding the membrane numbers and the volume of the membrane tank since in the pilot scale system containing cld wastewater oil removal efficiency was reduced from 98 96 to 89 17 and was changed from 99 5 to 94 98 in a system containing vlsfo wastewater by increasing inlet oil concentration in the range of 30 to 390 mg l fig 14b shows the changes in average tmp in both types of oily wastewater with increasing oil concentration the average tmp shows a trivial difference in two types of wastewater and it increased from 3 51 to 11 19 kpa for wastewater containing cld and from 3 085 to 10 79 kpa for wastewater containing vlsfo this minor difference in average tmp was due to a slight difference in the viscosities of two types of oily wastewater fig 15 demonstrates the impact of increasing aeration flow rates on average tmp for two types of wastewater containing light and heavy oils with an inlet oil concentration of 95 mg l obtained results demonstrated that the tmp reduction in vlsfo was higher than that of cld by increasing aeration flow rate due to the low viscosity density and molecular weight of vlsfo foulants were better removed from the membrane surface and tmp was reduced more substantially the changes in oil removal efficiency were studied for two types of oily wastewater as shown in fig 16a b during 24 h the concentration of oil in the inlet was specified as 45 75 and 95 mg l and with the increase in inlet oil concentration oil removal efficiency reached 41 49 27 78 and 16 87 for cld and 52 40 73 and 31 84 for vlsfo after 24 h in addition fig 17a b shows that tmp reached 39 79 45 75 and 51 kpa for cld and 34 95 43 48 and 50 27 kpa for vlsfo better results of oil removal efficiency were obtained for vlsfo with increasing inlet oil concentration from 45 to 95 mg l which was associated with the features of the light crude oil total filtration performance was impacted by the incremental filtration resistance in a long term operation due to the compact formation of a fouling layer on the membrane surface leading to a complete obstruction of the membrane pores 92 the increase in tmp and reduction in oil removal efficiency after 22 h for inlet oil concentration of 95 mg l demonstrated the necessity of chemical cleaning when tmp reached 40 kpa to restore the membrane permeability 5 conclusion this study highlights the feasibility of a membrane filtration system for oily wastewater treatment through cfd simulation in pilot and upscaled systems navier stokes equations were solved to determine the velocity distribution in the membrane tank the velocity and concentration profiles were evaluated to investigate the impact of operating parameters on oil removal efficiency and average tmp the hydrodynamic behavior of the system was investigated through different parameters such as gas volume fraction gas and liquid velocity and shear stress in the membrane tank and membranes the results from the proposed model showed a good agreement with experimental results with a relative error of less than 5 increasing inlet oil concentration increased tmp due to membrane fouling aeration decreases tmp and reduces membrane fouling as a result of generating high shear force along the membrane the developed model was further used to upscale a pilot scale membrane filtration system for larger field scale applications the upscaled system was capable of treating 10 000 l h with an oil removal efficiency of more than 91 results demonstrated that the upscaled system met the marpol 73 78 regulation when the inlet oil concentration was up to 175 mg l for wastewater containing cld and 235 mg l for wastewater containing vlsfo in addition obtained results revealed that the model can predict the permeate oil concentration and tmp after 24 h of filtration as well as the time that chemical cleaning is required to restore the membrane permeability credit

12583,the discharge of oily wastewater into the environment adversely impacts the ecosystem and human health due to the existence of toxic and carcinogenic compounds in oil to decrease the destructive environmental impacts membrane filtration technology has been used because it can remove emulsified oil with droplet sizes ranging from 1 to 10 μm which is a challenging issue for other types of treatment methods in this research a comprehensive 3d cfd model was developed to investigate the oily wastewater treatment process in a pilot scale membrane filtration system the model was validated using available data in experimental runs such as oil removal efficiency and average transmembrane pressure tmp for two types of oily wastewater containing heavy and light crude oils following that the hydrodynamic condition of the pilot scale unit was analyzed which is difficult to be investigated in a real condition the impacts of inlet oil concentration permeate and aeration flow rates on permeate oil concentration and tmp were also evaluated results revealed when the inlet oil concentration was at the threshold of 270 and 330 mg l containing heavy and light crude oil respectively the system met the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships marpol 73 78 regulation additionally the model was capable of predicting tmp changes under constant flux finally the validated model was used to upscale the pilot scale system to achieve a permeate production rate of 10 000 l h for larger capacities based on the results the oil removal efficiency was above 88 in pilot and upscaled systems graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords oily wastewater pilot scale system membrane filtration navier stokes equation mass transport data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the term oily wastewater is applied to all types of water containing various quantities of oil and grease as well as different types of suspended materials and other dissolved colloidal substances 1 oily wastewater is carcinogenic and toxic which has deleterious effects on the ecosystem and human health 2 3 it is generated from different sources and one major part of oily wastewater is associated with marine oil spill incidents 2 the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships marpol 73 78 set regulatory limits on the maximum oil concentration in oily wastewater discharge to be less than 15 mg l 4 various physical treatment methods such as gravity separation and dissolved air flotation daf have been employed to treat oily wastewater however they have several disadvantages such as prolonged processes large space requirements high energy consumption and low treatment efficacy chemical treatment methods such as coagulation and flocculation consume toxic compounds have high chemical costs and generate secondary pollutants 5 therefore the focus of studies has shifted to membrane filtration technology which has been proven to be the most effective technique to treat oily wastewater particularly because of the capability to remove oil droplet sizes ranging from 1 to 10 μm 3 6 this technology is a physical separation technique using a selectivity mechanism to eliminate particles and organics from wastewater which generates excellent permeate quality and low waste 7 10 the operation and maintenance of the membrane filtration system are simple and in contrast with biological based technologies changes in environmental parameters such as feed composition and oxygen level do not affect this type of filtration process 3 11 low requirement of chemical additives and small footprint are other benefits of membrane technologies in wastewater treatment processes 9 12 13 besides the advantages membrane fouling is an inevitable challenge reducing membrane flux membrane lifespan and consequently membrane performance 14 16 to improve the applicability of the membrane technology different types of studies were conducted numerical studies show that computational fluid dynamics cfd is a useful tool that can provide a comprehensive investigation of the membrane filtration process in terms of simulating fluid hydrodynamics modeling mass transfer predicting membrane fouling and investigating treatment process and scale up in different module scales 17 20 the method includes solving the navier stokes and continuity equations for a two dimensional 2d or three dimensional 3d steady laminar flow of an incompressible homogeneous and newtonian fluid with the highest precision 21 darcy equation was used to link the free flow model using the navier stokes equations to the flow that passed through the membrane for the first time in 1998 22 following that studies utilized cfd to provide an insight into the phenomena taking place inside membrane modules 23 30 and to enhance the whole performance of this technology 31 34 in addition several numerical studies have been conducted to simulate the membrane filtration technology for treatment purposes 35 39 most of the previous numerical studies have been focused to investigate the performance of the membrane technology to treat various types of wastewater at bench scale systems under the constant tmp using a 2d cfd model 26 40 and few numerical studies have been conducted to evaluate oil removal efficacy in a pilot and or large scale membrane filtration system operating under the constant flux using a 3d cfd model 41 42 in realistic circumstances conducting experimental runs with pilot and or large scale systems have different challenges and difficulties in terms of controlling experimental conditions and high cost of construction and fabrication of the system providing membranes pumps and air blowers hence researchers do not have broad access to the pilot and or large scale systems in laboratories and model validation using pilot scale experimental data has been restricted additionally operating a large scale membrane filtration system under the constant tmp results in a serious membrane fouling 43 since solute particles move toward the membrane surface more quickly than they are transported away causing more particles to be collected on the surface of the membrane at the constant tmp in comparison with the constant flux therefore simulation and operation of a membrane filtration system under constant flux conditions is more advantageous for industrial applications owing to a stable permeate production rate with negligible membrane fouling and the simplicity of the membrane cleaning 43 44 most of the previous numerical studies evaluated the effects of turbulency promoter methods such as gas sparging baffles and spacers in bench scale membrane filtration systems 45 49 however these studies did not analyze the effect of aeration on membrane fouling and did not evaluate the hydrodynamic behavior of a pilot scale membrane filtration system containing various types of oily wastewater with heavy and light crude oils to the best of the authors knowledge so far a comprehensive cfd model for a pilot scale membrane filtration system with the aim of oily wastewater treatment by considering involved multiphysics processes inside the system such as bubbly flow simultaneous mass transfer in the retentate and the porous membrane modules as well as membrane fouling consideration has not been investigated in the present work to address the mentioned knowledge gaps a comprehensive time dependent and 3d cfd model was developed for a pilot scale system to treat oily wastewater samples containing heavy crude oil cold lake dilbit cld and light crude oil very low sulfur fuel oil vlsfo under constant flux the model was validated based on available experimental data and after that the hydrodynamic behavior of the pilot scale unit and the impacts of various effective operational parameters on the permeate oil concentration and tmp have been studied finally to investigate the capability of the model for larger capacities the pilot scale system was upscaled to explore its potential as an onsite treatment technology for oil spill response operations this modeling approach can help decrease the adverse environmental impacts of oil spills by simulating a membrane filtration process it also provides scientific aid for decision making in oil spill response operations by increasing the capacity and improving the efficiency of the oil spill response operation 2 experimental setup the pilot scale membrane filtration system is shown in fig 1 which consists of a membrane tank with a dimension of 1 525 0 564 0 4 m h l w and two hydrophilic polytetrafluoroethylenes ptfe hollow fiber hf membrane modules 44 oily wastewater is pumped to a membrane tank with a flow rate of 1500 l h air gas phase is supplied through aerators located at the bottom of the membrane tank operational parameters are listed in table 1 the oil concentration was measured using an ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrometry 50 tmp was monitored and recorded using a programmable logic controller plc every minute for each experimental run 3 theoretical descriptions a 3d cfd model for a hydrophilic hf ultrafiltration uf membrane filtration system treating oily wastewater was developed using comsol multiphysics version 6 comsol inc the procedures of model development are described in the following sections 3 1 model geometry the 3d cfd model was developed and the elements of the model geometry are shown in fig 2 the computational region has a rectangular geometry with an actual dimension of the membrane tank mentioned in section 2 aerators are located under each membrane module to provide air bubbles in the membrane tank the feed solution in the membrane tank was assumed to be well mixed and the concentration viscosity and density were considered constant the differential pressure among the membranes did not cause any changes in the physical characteristics of the membranes flow through the membrane tank and inside porous membranes was assumed laminar and incompressible the liquid was assumed to be a newtonian fluid due to the low concentration of oil the relation between shear stress and the rate of deformation in newtonian fluids is expressed as eq 1 1 τ μ d du x dy where τ is the shear stress pa μ d is the dynamic viscosity pa s and du x dy is the shear rate 1 s 51 in this study the shear rate at the membrane surface was measured by cfd the pore structure of the membrane support was assumed to be homogeneous 3 2 geometrical and operational parameters geometrical and operational parameters are specified in the model for the treatment process in the membrane tank characteristics of crude oils are reported in table 2 based on the experiments and previous studies 52 57 the properties of oily wastewater are given in table 3 the length width and height of each membrane module are 0 16 0 14 1 295 m respectively the packing of fibers in each hf membrane was assumed to be a porous membrane module 58 59 table 4 demonstrates the membrane characteristics which are used in the simulation 3 3 modeling of fluid flow in the membrane tank the fluid velocity field is investigated to understand the concentration profiles in the membrane tank and membranes in this model the navier stokes equation was utilized for the liquid phase to govern the flow of oily wastewater in the membrane tank 60 62 and bubble velocity was explained by a slip model to obtain the volume fraction of bubbles a transport equation associated with the effective gas density was solved momentum and continuity equations for the liquid phase are shown in eqs 2 and 3 respectively eq 4 shows a transport equation for the gas volume fraction where m gl

diameter is 4 mm and therefore the drag coefficient c d is solved by eq 7 which is according to sokolichin eigenberger and lapin model 65 66 the surface tension is insignificant since the radius of the bubbles is large and the pressure difference inside and outside of the bubble is small 67 eq 8 represents the eotvos number e0 used in the drag coefficient equation and is defined as the ratio of

equations and boundary conditions are shown in table 7 3 6 upscaling upscaling is used to designate the systematic transferring of information from a specific scale level to a superior one 73 when the model of the current pilot scale system was validated it was utilized to upscale the oily wastewater membrane filtration system therefore according to the ratio between the target permeate production rate field throughput and the maximum throughput of the current system an upscaling index was obtained the parameters and equations that were used in comsol multiphysics 6 to upscale the model are shown in table 1a in the supplementary material section throughout scale up based on the difference in the rate of permeate production the volume of the membrane tank and the number of membrane modules and aerators were changed and simulated with the validated model according to the upscaling index the number of units was recalculated and the feed inlets and outlets in terms of the number of units and location were designed fig 3a b shows the upscaled system containing 42 units and 84 membranes from the side and top views this system has a dimension of 1 525 2 204 1 936 m h l w to achieve an upscaled 3d model the mentioned assumptions in section 3 1 were used governing equations for both the membrane tank and membrane module were the same 3 7 solution methodology in this modeling approach governing equations were solved by comsol multiphysics 6 using the finite element method fem to obtain the liquid and gas velocity distribution in the membrane tank the two phase fluid flow module was used this study was initially conducted in an unsteady state condition for a fluid flow module in the membrane tank to investigate the hydrodynamics of the system fluid flow in the membrane tank reached a steady state at a short simulation time based on the results from different cfd runs therefore the fluid flow module was solved at a steady state to investigate the operational parameters on permeate oil concentration and tmp to reduce computation time the obtained velocity from this module was utilized in the module of mass transfer the velocity of the fluid in the membrane was calculated by darcy s law in the membrane module and the obtained velocity was applied in the porous media mass transfer module after integrating three modules in three dimensions the mass transfer module was solved in a time dependent model to calculate the permeate oil concentration 3 8 model validation and verification 3 8 1 mesh independence analysis free tetrahedral geometry mesh configuration was utilized in this model 74 and a grid independence study was performed to estimate the optimum simulation grid size for the simulation domain and check the accuracy of the results and save computation time and cost 71 the permeate oil concentration was investigated for various grid sizes and used as a criterion to check mesh independency it was compared to the permeate oil concentration achieved by experiments which are shown in table 8 a qualitative representation of the generated mesh for membrane tank simulation with hp core i7 3 4ghz cpu and 16 gb of ram is shown in fig 4 the results of this study were obtained using a computational mesh for fluid dynamics with 396 364 domain elements this mesh generated less than 2 average error in the results compared to finer meshes 476 414 domain elements which was sufficiently accurate 3 8 2 numerical model validation a criterion for model validation using relative error re is expressed by eq 15 15 re e oil removal exp e oil removal model e oil removal exp 100 where e oil removal exp is oil removal efficiency obtained by the experiments and e oil removal model is oil removal efficiency achieved by the model also average tmp was examined during the experimental runs and compared with simulation results as measured by eq 16 16 re tmp exp tmp model tmp exp 100 where tmp exp is the average tmp obtained by experiments and tmp model is the average tmp obtained by the model the results in table 9 for permeate oil concentration and average tmp indicate that the modeling results have a good agreement with experimental results at different operating conditions with the oily wastewater containing cld and vlsfo with an average relative error of less than 5 therefore the cfd model is reliable and can use for system parametric study and scale up in addition the verification of the model was fulfilled with the experimental results 4 results and discussion 4 1 analysis of the system hydrodynamics 4 1 1 influence of the aeration flow rate on gas volume fraction using aeration leads to decrease membrane fouling and increase permeate volume production and therefore enhances the performance of the membrane filtration system 75 76 in this simulation study aeration flow rates ranged from 4 8 6 to 6 8 m3 h and were investigated for two types of oily wastewater fig 5a b shows the changes in gas volume fraction at three aeration flow rates in a system containing cld and vlsfo respectively gas entered the membrane tank from the aerators and the profile grew and remained steady over time 64 fig 5a shows when the system contained 100 mg l of cld at the aeration flow rate and permeate flow rate of 4 8 m3 h and 72 l h respectively the gas volume fraction reached 2 50 at 25 s and then had a stable condition while for vlsfo the fraction reached 2 52 at 25 s when the aeration flow rate and permeate flow rate were 6 m3 h and 72 l h respectively after 35 s the gas volume fraction reached 3 68 and became steady whereas for vlsfo the gas volume fraction was 3 8 after 35 s at an aeration flow rate of 6 8 m3 h and the same permeate flow rate after 60 s the gas volume fraction was 5 4 and became stable while for vlsfo the gas volume fraction reached 5 6 after 60 s and it became steady after 67 2 s results showed that increasing the aeration flow rate increased gas volume fraction in two types of oily wastewater 77 the insignificant difference in gas volume fractions was due to the negligible difference in viscosity and drag force of the two types of wastewater based on a previous study when the liquid viscosity is less than 0 01 pa s bubble breakup rate and gas volume fraction are negligibly affected by viscosity 78 which is verified by the results of the present study 4 1 2 influence of the aeration flow rate on gas and liquid velocities fig 6a c demonstrates the liquid velocity arrow plots as a function of aeration flow rate at three aeration flow rates when the filtration system contained 100 mg l of cld with a permeate flow rate of 72 l h the color of the arrow plots indicated the gas velocity quantity in various zones of the membrane tank gas velocity close to the walls of the membrane tank was 1 m s which was the lowest the reason is associated with the large bubbles inside the membrane tank jiang et al 79 showed that large bubbles tended to move toward the middle part of the tank which was related to the lift force impact while the gas velocity at the bottom side of the membrane tank close to air spargers was between 3 5 and 5 5 m s which was the highest gas velocity at the surface of the membrane tank was between 2 and 3 m s where the gas was exiting the tank fig 6a c shows that a circulating fluid flow with larger arrows was developed when the aeration flow rate increased from 4 8 to 6 8 m3 h the whole fluid domain was shown as a downward circulating flow region in the central domain above the air spargers and the regions near the walls of the membrane tank previous studies similarly concluded that as the gas flow rate increases the system tends to more unsteady state conditions and most of the bubbles are moved forcefully to the middle of the tank the down flow of liquid near the walls was confirmed by bubbles flowing down and kept almost stationary in that area 80 82 the treatment system containing vlsfo showed similar results fig 7a b shows the changes in liquid velocities with time at different aeration flow rates when the filtration system contained 100 mg l of cld with a permeate flow rate of 72 l h liquid velocities were obtained at about 0 81 1 06 and 1 81 m s for aeration flow rates of 4 8 6 and 6 8 m3 h at 15 25 and 28 s respectively shown in fig 7a furthermore fig 7b shows when oily wastewater contained 100 mg l of vlsfo at the same permeate flow rate liquid velocities were 0 83 1 09 and 1 87 m s for aeration flow rates of 4 8 6 and 6 8 m3 h at 15 25 and 28 s respectively results confirmed that the liquid velocity condition and its quantity were not significantly altered by changing the type of oil since the concentration of oil was in a low range and the impact of oil viscosity was negligible in addition liquid velocity in two types of oil increased when the aeration flow rate went up because of the agitation inside the membrane tank generated by aerators 83 85 4 1 3 influence of the aeration flow rate on shear rate and shear stress of the membrane surface the major hydrodynamic technique to decrease the deposition of particles on the membrane surface is aeration 84 fig 8a c demonstrates the shear rate along the membrane surface in a system containing cld after reaching a steady state condition oil concentration and permeate flow rate were 100 mg l and 72 l h respectively and aeration flow rates were various fig 8a c shows that the shear rate ranged from 1 to 10 1 s and it decreased at a membrane height of approximately 0 5 m in the middle of the membrane surface toward the top between 4 and 8 1 s the shear rate was between 7 and 10 1 s at the top side of the membrane surface and this was because of the gas velocity which was high in this area as shown in fig 6a c as the aeration flow rate increased from 4 8 to 6 8 m3 h the shear rate was obtained higher in fig 8a compared to fig 8c and there was the same condition for vlsfo fig 9a b shows the average shear stress and shear rate on the surface of the membranes at aeration flow rates of 4 8 6 and 6 8 m3 h for two types of oily wastewater one study mentioned that liquid viscosity considerably influenced the gas liquid interfacial structure and interfacial shear stress 86 hence the minor difference in shear stress was because of the higher dynamic viscosity of the wastewater containing cld compared to that of vlsfo when the viscosity was higher in the wastewater containing cld at the same aeration flow rate and the consequent shear rate the shear stress was a little higher compared to the wastewater containing vlsfo as shown in fig 9a 4 2 influence of the aeration flow rate on tmp considering the hydrodynamic analysis increasing gas volume fraction gas velocity liquid velocity and shear rate affected the system performance when using aeration aeration increases turbulence and provides a homogenous condition for the fluid and its strong movement in the membrane tank 48 87 fig 10a b shows the impact of increasing aeration flow rate ranging from 4 8 to 6 8 m3 h on average tmp under unsteady state conditions for the system treating wastewater containing cld and vlsfo respectively permeate flow rate was 72 l h and oil concentrations were in the range of 35 to 300 mg l for two types of wastewater fig 10a b demonstrates that with an increase in aeration flow rate the average tmp decreased and the changes in tmp had mainly linear downward trends in two types of oily wastewater this reduction was due to cake layer removal from the membrane surface the impact of aeration on removing the cake layer was higher with an increase in oil concentration as shown in both figures because of increasing the mass transfer coefficient of oil in the system and improving the transfer of oil foulants from the surface of the membrane to the bulk solution comparing two figures revealed that the rate of tmp decline in vlsfo vs aeration flow rate was more than that of cld this was associated with the physical characteristics of oil including viscosity and molecular weight which were higher in heavy crude oil i e cld and therefore aeration removed the foulants of light crude oil from the membrane surface more easily previous studies such as orantes et al 88 similarly reported the advancement in performance of a membrane filtration system by increasing the aeration flow rate in their study aerators were placed under each membrane module designed to create turbulence around the membranes results of this study showed that changing the aeration flow rate from 25 to 50 l h led to decrease in tmp 4 3 influence of the inlet oil concentration on treatment efficiency and tmp fig 11a b shows the predicted permeate oil concentration and average tmp for inlet oil concentrations ranging between 30 and 390 mg l and the aeration flow rate and permeate flow rate of 4 8 m3 h and 72 l h for cld and vlsfo respectively fig 11a demonstrates that the permeate oil concentration in cld changed from 0 3132 to 42 24 mg l for an inlet oil concentration of 30 to 390 mg l and the average tmp changed in the range of 2 69 to 20 26 kpa the changes in the permeate oil concentration for vlsfo were from 0 145 to 19 564 mg l for an inlet oil concentration in the range of 30 to 390 mg l and the average tmp increased from 2 29 to 19 6 kpa as shown in fig 11b results showed that increasing inlet oil concentration to 270 mg l met marpol 73 78 regulation in the filtration system containing cld whereas in vlsfo increasing oil concentration to 330 mg l met marpol 73 78 regulation oil removal efficiency decreased from 98 96 to 89 17 for cld runs and vlsfo changed from 99 5 to 94 98 by increasing inlet oil concentration in the range of 30 to 390 mg l when oil concentration increases the number of oil droplets that interact with the membrane develops and as a result the oil droplets pass across the membrane easily and the oil removal efficiency reduces 89 an increase in the inlet oil concentration leads to the accumulation of oil on the membrane surface and into pores and consequently membrane fouling previous studies such as janknecht et al 90 reported when the inlet oil concentration in feed increased from 2 to 5 vol oil removal efficiency decreased from 99 99 to 99 98 similarly kayvani fard et al 91 concluded that when the inlet oil concentration increased from 500 to 10 000 mg l the oil removal efficiency decreased significantly from 85 to less than 60 respectively 4 4 influence of the permeate flow rate on treatment efficiency and tmp fig 12a b and fig 13a b show the permeate oil concentration and average tmp for permeate flow rates of 48 72 144 216 240 l h the aeration flow rate of 4 8 m3 h and oil concentrations of 35 50 65 80 95 110 200 300 mg l for two types of oily wastewater fig 12a and fig 13a show that with an increase in the permeate flow rate the removal efficacy reduced and this reduction was more substantial for higher oil concentrations i e 200 and 300 mg l and at higher permeate flow rates the reduction in the removal efficiency was due to greater convective movement of oil particles through the membrane since high convective transport caused high surface tension forces between water and oil hence high oil movement across the membrane led to rapid transport of oil through the membrane and consequently a lower permeate flow rate could enhance oil removal efficiency and permeate quality 6 the higher the oil concentration is in the influent the higher the oil concentration passes through the membrane when the concentration is high the hydrophilic features of the membrane cannot obstruct the oil accumulation on the membrane surface as a result of the decrease in repulsion capability of the membrane and hence removal efficiency is reduced more remarkably 91 comparing vlsfo with cld the concentration of permeate was lower than that of cld results in fig 12b and fig 13b demonstrate that average tmp increased with increasing permeate flow rate in both figures since at higher permeate flow rates pressure at two sides of the membrane went up according to darcy s law however this increase confirmed that the range of membrane flux was appropriate as the tmp did not jump and increase considerably with the increase in permeate flow rate as shown in fig 12b and fig 13b 4 5 upscaling the system fig 14a b shows the permeate oil concentration for various inlet oil concentrations of cld and vlsfo in an upscaled system this figure demonstrates that when oil concentration went up from 25 to 255 mg l the permeate oil concentration increased from 0 73 to 36 5 mg l for cld and from 0 34 to 17 15 mg l for vlsfo the upscaled system met the marpol 73 78 regulation when the inlet oil concentration was 175 mg l for cld and 235 mg l for vlsfo because the permeate oil concentrations were 14 59 and 13 81 mg l for cld and vlsfo respectively the system removal efficiency was attained above 91 for various oil concentrations showing the potential of the upscaled system to work under 10 000 l h and treat oily wastewater containing cld and vlsfo the obtained results confirmed that the system performance was influenced by expanding the membrane numbers and the volume of the membrane tank since in the pilot scale system containing cld wastewater oil removal efficiency was reduced from 98 96 to 89 17 and was changed from 99 5 to 94 98 in a system containing vlsfo wastewater by increasing inlet oil concentration in the range of 30 to 390 mg l fig 14b shows the changes in average tmp in both types of oily wastewater with increasing oil concentration the average tmp shows a trivial difference in two types of wastewater and it increased from 3 51 to 11 19 kpa for wastewater containing cld and from 3 085 to 10 79 kpa for wastewater containing vlsfo this minor difference in average tmp was due to a slight difference in the viscosities of two types of oily wastewater fig 15 demonstrates the impact of increasing aeration flow rates on average tmp for two types of wastewater containing light and heavy oils with an inlet oil concentration of 95 mg l obtained results demonstrated that the tmp reduction in vlsfo was higher than that of cld by increasing aeration flow rate due to the low viscosity density and molecular weight of vlsfo foulants were better removed from the membrane surface and tmp was reduced more substantially the changes in oil removal efficiency were studied for two types of oily wastewater as shown in fig 16a b during 24 h the concentration of oil in the inlet was specified as 45 75 and 95 mg l and with the increase in inlet oil concentration oil removal efficiency reached 41 49 27 78 and 16 87 for cld and 52 40 73 and 31 84 for vlsfo after 24 h in addition fig 17a b shows that tmp reached 39 79 45 75 and 51 kpa for cld and 34 95 43 48 and 50 27 kpa for vlsfo better results of oil removal efficiency were obtained for vlsfo with increasing inlet oil concentration from 45 to 95 mg l which was associated with the features of the light crude oil total filtration performance was impacted by the incremental filtration resistance in a long term operation due to the compact formation of a fouling layer on the membrane surface leading to a complete obstruction of the membrane pores 92 the increase in tmp and reduction in oil removal efficiency after 22 h for inlet oil concentration of 95 mg l demonstrated the necessity of chemical cleaning when tmp reached 40 kpa to restore the membrane permeability 5 conclusion this study highlights the feasibility of a membrane filtration system for oily wastewater treatment through cfd simulation in pilot and upscaled systems navier stokes equations were solved to determine the velocity distribution in the membrane tank the velocity and concentration profiles were evaluated to investigate the impact of operating parameters on oil removal efficiency and average tmp the hydrodynamic behavior of the system was investigated through different parameters such as gas volume fraction gas and liquid velocity and shear stress in the membrane tank and membranes the results from the proposed model showed a good agreement with experimental results with a relative error of less than 5 increasing inlet oil concentration increased tmp due to membrane fouling aeration decreases tmp and reduces membrane fouling as a result of generating high shear force along the membrane the developed model was further used to upscale a pilot scale membrane filtration system for larger field scale applications the upscaled system was capable of treating 10 000 l h with an oil removal efficiency of more than 91 results demonstrated that the upscaled system met the marpol 73 78 regulation when the inlet oil concentration was up to 175 mg l for wastewater containing cld and 235 mg l for wastewater containing vlsfo in addition obtained results revealed that the model can predict the permeate oil concentration and tmp after 24 h of filtration as well as the time that chemical cleaning is required to restore the membrane permeability credit

12584,sulfamethoxazole smx a common antibiotic is commonly used to treat urinary tract infections and intestine infections caused by sensitive bacteria water pollution is exacerbated as a result of its abuse and discharge the feasibility and advantage of using microbial fuel cells mfc to degrade sulfamethoxazole have been proved however mfc is limited in wastewater treatment due to low bioelectric catalytic efficacy and expensive electrode costs in this research high performance fe co n bc anode materials were prepared by bimetal and n doping to improve the electrochemical performance and biocompatibility of the electrodes and fe co n bc anode mfc was applied to the degradation of smx the results show that the mfc of fe co n bc anode has the lowest internal resistance 144 46 ω greatly improves the electrical performance and the maximum degradation rate of smx reaches 89 1 which is 2 1 times that of a conventional anaerobic reactor the results show that fe co n bc anode has good physicochemical properties and the fe co n bc anode mfc reactor can effectively degrade smx keywords microbial fuel cells anode smx degradation mfc performance microbial community characteristics data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction as one of the typical antibiotics sulfamethoxazole smx is widely used in the treatment of urinary tract infection intestinal infection biliary tract infection and other diseases caused by sensitive bacteria 8 in recent years due to its abuse and discharge it has caused serious water environment pollution 20 due to the characteristics of refractory and persistent the smx discharged into water bodies tend to accumulate gradually which will cause serious damage to the ecosystem and human health 40 with the high frequency detection of smx in groundwater and surface water the environmental pollution caused by antibiotic smx is becoming increasingly prominent therefore how to treat smx in wastewater with effective methods is very important 42 bioelectrochemical system bes is a combination of microbial technology and electrochemical technology which can realize simultaneous wastewater treatment and energy recovery 3 in the face of increasingly severe energy crisis and environmental pollution researchers have made a lot of efforts to develop a variety of bes such as microbial fuel cells and microbial reverse electrodialysis cells mfc mrc electricity production 16 microbial electrolytic cells mec h2 formation 29 microbial electrosynthesis cells mesc chemical synthesis 17 and microbial desalinity tank mdc seawater desalination etc 31 44 it can be found that significant scientific progress has been made in understanding the reaction mechanism of microbial electrochemical systems and developing efficient materials 2 32 in recent years the development of mfc technology has made great progress 5 28 based on the exploration of the basic principle of mfc the optimization of system performance and the research of the practical application of mfc as well as the coupling of mfc with other technologies to realize the effective utilization of electric energy has become a research hotspot in order to meet the standards of high performance and low cost in the actual environment 33 more and more attention has been paid to the use of mfcs to degrade smx 27 41 some scholars 46 used the coupling of constructed wetlands and microbial fuel cells cw mfcs to drive the smx elimination in bes for research the results indicate that the main degradation pathway of smx is biotransformation smx at 30 mg l was rapidly degraded in the cw mfcs system while the low current had no effect on the degradation products but improved the removal rate of smx miran 23 used mfc batch mode to treat different initial concentrations of smx the results showed that the degradation rate of smx increased from 0 67 μmol h to 13 36 μmol h as the initial concentration of smx increased from 0 04 mmol l to 0 79 mmol l therefore how to efficiently treat antibiotics while achieving electricity production and resource recovery has become one of the most urgent problems in the field of bioelectrochemistry the fundamental component of bacterial enrichment electron collection and conduction in mfc is the anode the structure and chemical properties of anode materials have effects on electron transport anode impedance and microbial adhesion and these effects limit anode performance and mfc high power production 26 many academics have been working on ways to enhance anode performance recently including using better catalysts and reaction medium 10 11 enhancing the anode arrangement 25 connecting the metal collector fluid 14 etc some researchers have improved the performance of mfc by modifying anode materials lowy et al 22 used fe3o4 and fe3 ni modified graphite felt plate anodes to produce 1 7 to 2 2 times more energy than unmodified graphite anodes mohamed et al 24 deposited fe fe2o3 on the surface of different carbon based materials by electrodeposition which improved the microbial adhesion on the electrode surface and reduced the electron transfer resistance at present the research on improving the performance of mfc anode materials is still limited by many limitations and the application of bimetal and heteroatom codoped anode materials in mfc is still lacking a gel solid anode material was prepared in this study by co doping waste biomass chinese medicine residue with fe co n and then used in an mfc anode mfc was used to study the wastewater containing smx antibiotics and to explore the influencing factors degradation efficiency and degradation pathways of smx degradation by this system in addition this paper also explored the changes in microbial community characteristics during the degradation of smx in the mfc system by optimizing the preparation of mfc anode material the start up time of mfc is shortened and the power density and other electrical properties are improved so as to improve the practical application of mfc in water treatment which is limited by low power 2 materials and methods 2 1 the preparation of

removed 1 ml of ammonium formaldehyde citrate was added and 0 2 ml of acetic acid 30 mg l was added after 3 min the fe co n bc precursor was prepared after drying by stirring continuously until it became a black gel the pyrolysis was maintained at 900 c for 2 h in a tube furnace filled with n2 to obtain fe co n bc fig 1 as a control group n bc was not doped with feco 2 2 sludge inoculation and mfc operation the lanzhou sewage treatment plant provided the inoculated sludge and the nutrient solution was changed every four days c6h12o6 was used as the substrate and the smx directed anaerobes were cultured and acclimated in a constant temperature oscillator after culture and acclimation at 5 mg l smx for a period of time the concentration of smx in the culture medium was successively increased from 5 mg l to 30 mg l they were cultured and domesticated separately for a period of time by using the liquid phase to measure the degradation of smx it was discovered that the rate of smx degradation in the acclimation bottle did not change significantly over time demonstrating that the acclimation of smx degrading bacteria was complete and could be used for mfc inoculation as shown in

co n bc precursor fig 3 3413 cm 1 is a nh 2340 cm 1 is the absorption peak of co2 in the air 1546 cm 1 is the stretching vibration peak of co and 1200 cm 1 is the asymmetric stretching vibration peak of c o c 30 the results show that by doping spinel cofe2o4 the hydroxymethylated prepolymer is formed by reacting with bc formaldehyde solution and melamine it was then esterified with an ammonium formaldehyde citrate solution so that cofe2o4 was closely combined with the prepolymer under the catalysis of glacial acetic acid the polycondensation reaction was accelerated thus forming a thermosetting polymer uniformly coated with cross linked biochar after the pyrolysis of the fe co n bc precursor in a tubular furnace the morphology and microstructure of the material were observed by sem and tem as shown in fig 4 it can be observed from fig 4a b that the surface of the n bc sample is relatively smooth without obvious particles indicating that the bc particles are coated by cross linked pyrolysis products in fig 4c d it can be observed that cofe2o4 and bc particles are uniformly dispersed in the polymer structure and the material morphology is circular compared with the sem of n bc samples the introduction of feco significantly changed the structural morphology of the anode material from smooth to rough this structural morphology increases the surface roughness and enhances the attachment and growth of microorganisms on the surface of the anode material fig 4e f show that there are circular particles of tens of nanometers in size distributed everywhere indicating that the shape of the sample is basically spherical the crystal plane spacing shown in the figure is 0 20 nm which is consistent with the crystal plane spacing of co3fe7 crystal 110 9 in order to analyze the chemical composition and valence state of the electrode sample surface elements xps test was carried out on the prepared fe co n bc material in the high resolution co 2p spectrum fig 5a the co 2p spectrum of fe co n bc splits into 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 double peaks due to spin orbit coupling the co 2p features of fe co n bc correspond to the characteristic peaks of co2 2p3 2 780 46 ev and 2p1 2 795 71 ev and co3 2p3 2 782 07 ev and 2p1 2 796 62 ev accompanied by two satellite peaks 7 similarly in the fe 2p spectrum fig 5b fe2 2p3 2 peak at 710 31 ev fe3 2p3 2 peak at 712 83 ev fe2 2p1 2 peak at 723 01 ev and fe3 2p1 2 peak at 725 01 ev 39 the peaks of the satellite peaks were 718 12 ev and 726 43 ev respectively fig 5c shows the xrd pattern of the prepared sample compared with bc samples it is found that the diffraction peaks of n bc and fe co n bc materials appear at 26 indicating that the pyrolytic materials have a certain degree of graphitization in the obtained fe co n bc material diffraction peaks of 44 72 110 and 65 18 200 are found in the xrd pattern which is completely consistent with the standard card of co3fe7 pdf no 48 1817 19 indicating that co3fe7 crystal is formed after fe and co pyrolysis 3 1 2 electrochemical and mfc performance analysis of the fe co n bc anode after the successful start up of mfc when the nutrient solution of mfc meets the growth of microorganisms the maximum voltage output can maintain a relatively stable state for a period of time which proves that mfc has reached a stable stage 34 a data collector is used to collect voltage data every 10 min and draw the voltage change curve with time fig 5d which reflects the voltage change of mfc in 25 days of operation in the stable phase fe co n bc anode can reach more than 500 mv and the maximum voltage that can be reached is 619 33 mv the same as n bc it takes about 6 days of activation period to reach the stable output voltage 552 mv and the stable period is about 4 days although the maximum output stable voltage of n bc reaches 528 mv the stable period only takes about 1 day to decline and the output cycle time is short the results show that feco doping affects the maximum stable voltage and the output time of the battery to maintain the stable voltage as can be seen from fig 6a the prepared fe co n bc anode generates a higher current density than other anodes and the open circuit voltages of mfc are bc 0 652 v n bc 0 717 v and fe co n bc 0 836 v respectively the maximum output power density of the anode electrode mfc was bc 206 mw m2 n bc 663 mw m2 and fe co n bc 1181 61 mw m2 respectively n bc anode mfc and fe co n bc anode mfc have maximum power densities that are 3 22 times and 5 73 times higher than bc anode mfc respectively obviously an anode doped with fe co n can significantly increase the output power of mfc 43 in fig 6b the prepared fe co n bc 4 67a m2 anode produced the highest current density followed by n bc 2 17a m2 and bc 1 21a m2 anodes indicating that fe co n bc anode had a low polarization the polarization curves in the figure all have three sections active polarization ohmic polarization and concentration polarization mfc is mainly ohmic polarization the maximum power density appears in the ohmic polarization region and the voltage drop is always decreasing during the whole discharge process the ohm polarization region in the polarization curve is fitted and the slope of the line represents the apparent internal resistance 4 as can be seen from the figure the slope of the fe co n bc anode curve is the smallest indicating that the polarization trend of the cell is the slowest the ohmic polarization region fitting results of the polarization curves of mfcs with different anodes show that the constructed mfc reaction device has different apparent internal resistances as shown in table 1 according to the polarization curve fitting calculation of different anodes the mfc internal resistance of the fe co n bc anode is the least 144 46 ω followed by n bc 269 65 ω and bc 537 84 ω previous preliminary studies of the h shape mfc have shown that their limitations are high internal resistance values making it difficult to distinguish their performance differences 13 it can be seen from the above data that doping with appropriate amount of bimetal and nitrogen can reduce the apparent internal resistance of mfc device and effectively improve the electrical performance of mfc 18 after the anode of the reaction device was successfully started and operated stably for four cycles the biofilm on the electrode surface was formed and stably existed cv test was conducted on all the mfc reaction devices and the results were shown in fig 6c the fe co n bc anode has the largest cv curve area which indicates that the microbial activity of generating electricity on the electrode is strong the current density generated by fe co n bc 9 40 ma m2 anode mfc was 1 93 times that of n bc anode 4 86 ma m2 indicating that feco and n co doped anode materials promoted extracellular electron transport fig 6d shows the eis measured by an electrochemical workstation after the biofilm of the mfc anode was formed and stabilized and the eis amplified by the mfc of the n bc fe co n bc anode the eigenvalues of ohm internal resistance rs charge transfer resistance rct and diffusion internal resistance rw can be obtained by equivalent fitting of the external circuit table 2 by comparing different anode materials it is found that the rs value 8 66 ω of the anode mfc doped with feco is between the rs value of bc and n bc and the rct value of the anode mfc doped with feco is lower than the resistance value of bc and n bc anode mfc the rct of the bc anode mfc is 109 89 times that of the fe co n bc anode these results indicate that appropriate nitrogen doping can effectively promote electron transport between the electrode and the electrogenic microorganism the rct of the n bc also decreased with a value of 5 79 ω this indicates that the amount of feco doping will affect the charge transfer of electrons generated by electrogenic microorganisms between the anode and the protein membrane this result indicates that the mfc at the fe co n bc anode has a faster electron transport process between the surface and the microorganism 3 2 degradation efficiency of smx by different anodes of mfc using sodium acetate as substrate the smx degradation ability of different anode mfcs was investigated in three different anode materials bc mfc 1 fe co n bc mfc 2 and conventional anaerobic reactor occ under open circuit condition according to fig 7a on the third day of operation the smx degradation concentrations of mfc 1 mfc 2 and occ are 16 79 mg l 13 04 mg l and 28 50 mg l respectively on the fifth day the maximum degradation rate of mfc in mfc 2 reached 87 5 the degradation rates of smx by all mfcs were 1 71 times mfc 1 and 1 91 times mfc 2 that of the occ respectively the reason for this difference may be that feco doping increases the roughness of the surface of the prepared fe co n bc anode material making it easier for microorganisms to attach and grow on the surface of the anode material the bacteria on the anode consume the substrate while also supplying the electrons needed to break down smx at the same time the degradation of antibiotic smx by conventional anaerobic microbial reactor is limited fig 7b shows the variation trend of smx degradation after six cycles of reactor operation the degradation rates of smx in mfc 1 mfc 2 and occ were 80 76 2 48 91 06 1 96 and 41 79 1 78 respectively the mfc anode chamber significantly improved smx degradation indicating that the electrons released by microorganisms in the mfc reactor when they consumed sodium acetate provided favorable conditions for sn bond breaking during smx degradation the removal effect of fe co n bc anode mfc on organic matter was significant indicating that the rate of sodium acetate consumed by electricity producing microorganisms was accelerated therefore the more electrons provided for smx degradation the higher the degradation rate of smx set the concentration of smx at 30 mg l and the ph value at 7 to study the degradation rate and kinetic characteristics of smx in different reactors the first sample was taken 12 h after the nutrient was added to the reactor and then samples were taken every 12 h to detect the concentration of smx in the effluent as shown in fig 7c the degradation rate of smx by mfc 1 was fast in the first 24 h and the degradation rate reached about 50 while occ was only 26 78 a first order kinetic model was used to simulate the smx degradation process by conventional anaerobic reactions with mfc at different anodes fig 7d shows that smx degradation processes in different systems are all in line with first order kinetic equations and the correlation coefficients r2 of mfc systems are all around 0 96 indicating that the curve fitting degree of the two reactors is high in table 3 the k values of different reaction devices increased gradually during the degradation of smx and the reaction rate constant of the mfc 1 was 0 0229 which was more obvious than that of the occ according to the calculation the half lives of smx degradation by mfc 1 and mfc 2 are 37 31 h and 30 15 h respectively while the half lives of smx degradation by occ are 3 39 4 2 times that of mfc this indicates that the higher the number of electrons produced on the anode during the same reaction time the stronger the ability of mfc to degrade smx 3 3 analysis of influencing factors the initial concentration of smx may affect the tolerance of microorganisms four groups of reactors were set up with initial concentrations of 10 20 30 and 40 mg l respectively two parallel reactors were set in each group and other conditions were consistent after the mfc system operated stably for two cycles the effects of different initial concentrations of smx on the degradation effect were investigated fig 8a shows the change of smx concentration over time in mfc reactors with initial concentrations of 10 mg l and 20 mg l the smx degradation concentration reached half of the initial concentration on day 1 and only 0 73 mg l and 1 88 mg l on day 5 in addition the mfc reactor with an initial concentration of 30 mg l degraded half of the original smx on day 2 while 40 mg l degraded half of the original smx for the longest time the results showed that the higher the initial concentration of smx the greater the impact on microbial metabolism in mfc fig 8b shows that on the 5th day degradation rates of 10 20 30 and 40 mg l of smx were 92 71 90 62 90 01 and 84 26 respectively with the increase of initial concentration the degradation rate of smx gradually decreased indicating that the raw inoculated sludge obtained from a sewage treatment plant after acclimation can play a good role in the degradation and removal of smx in conclusion it is feasible for mfc to degrade smx at different initial concentrations it has been shown that ph values affect the electrochemical effects and performance of mfcs and also play an important role in the degradation of smx 6 12 four groups of experiments with ph 6 6 5 7 and 7 5 were set up with two parallel experiments in each group the concentration of smx was 30 mg l and other conditions were consistent after the mfc system ran smoothly for two cycles the effects of mfc on smx degradation under different ph conditions were investigated fig 8c shows the change of smx degradation concentration by mfc over time under different ph conditions with the change of environmental ph the degradation concentration of smx by mfc also changes on the first day of degradation at ph 6 6 5 7 and 7 5 the degradation concentration of smx by mfc was 20 76 mg l 18 59 mg l 13 26 mg l and 23 18 mg l respectively only the degradation concentration of smx at ph 7 was the lowest and reached half of the original on the second day of degradation the smx degradation concentration of the mfc reactor at ph 6 reached half of the original concentration while that of the mfc reactor at ph 7 5 reached half of the original concentration only on the third day the results showed that the mfc reactor could inhibit the degradation efficiency of smx under acidic or alkaline conditions in fig 8d at ph 6 6 5 7 and 7 5 the corresponding smx degradation rates are 77 02 86 56 90 33 and 73 65 respectively under the conditions of ph 6 5 and 7 the degradation rate of smx by mfc was above 85 and the degradation rate of smx by mfc at ph 7 was the highest this may be because in the mfc anode reaction chamber the h provided under acidic conditions improves the mass transfer efficiency while the oh will react with h under alkaline conditions to reduce the mass transfer efficiency the above experimental results indicate that in the mfc anode reaction chamber the degradation efficiency of smx is higher under weak acidic or neutral conditions especially in the neutral environment 3 4 analysis of degradation products and degradation paths by analyzing the liquid chromatography of degradation products at different time stages the peak height of the target pollutants gradually decreases with the passage of time and the peak time of smx is about 4 14 min before this peak position there is also the formation of substances and the peak height increases with the passage of time indicating that the parent is gradually transforming into intermediate products the effluent samples of the 30 mg l smx system in mfc 2 were selected for the product analysis and the degradation mechanism as shown in fig 9 the peak of mass charge ratio m z 253 18 is the peak of smx but the intensity is very low indicating that the mfc reactor can significantly degrade smx table 4 shows that the deduced molecular formula chemical structure formula and mass to charge ratio of smx and its degradation intermediates in mfc anodic effluent were analyzed by comparison with the standard spectrogram the material with a mass to charge ratio of 254 was identified as the parent smx and nine transformation products of smx p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 p6 p7 p8 and p9 were identified the two substances with a mass to charge ratio of 173 and 136 were inferred to be sulfanilamide and acetanilide by the mass spectrogram p1 p2 p3 and p4 are formed by sn bond cleavage p6 is an intermediate formed by the smx coupling reaction fig 10 shows two pathways of smx degradation in the anode chamber of mfc path i smx is attacked by oh resulting in the formation of p1 and p3 after an sn bond fracture the amino group of p1 is oxidized to form the nitroso derivative s1 which is further oxidized to form the nitroso product p2 since the anode chamber of mfc is an anaerobic environment the oxidation conditions cannot be met and it is difficult to produce a large amount of s1 and p2 in the anode chamber p3 is further hydroxylated to form p4 path ii smx coupling reaction results in the formation of a symmetrical long chain p5 containing two benzene rings which is subsequently similar to the degradation pathway of path i where s2 is transformed into s3 and then transformed into sulfa p6 by nn fracture p6 is cleaved to form p7 4 amino 2 butanol which is easily degraded by microorganisms due to its chain like structure and further transformed into p8 n butanol and p9 butane and finally mineralized into methane co2 etc under anoxic conditions 3 5 microbial diversity analysis the experiment analyzed the microbial community characteristics of the original inoculated sludge bs smx acclimated sludge smx and smx degraded biofilm sludge mfc smx in the anode chamber of mfc the structural succession and functional changes of microbial communities were investigated under different conditions table 5 lists a series of diversity index values sobs shannon simpson and coverage coverage is used to estimate the coverage of each sample library the higher the value the lower the probability that the sequence in the sample is not detected 36 the coverage values of the three samples were greater than 90 indicating that the sequencing results accurately reflected the biological characteristics of the samples the larger the shannon index is and the smaller the simpson index is the higher the microbial diversity of the sample is the higher shannon index 7 6900 and lower simpson index 0 9444 were found in the samples of mfc smx indicating the higher species abundance and diversity of mfc smx the reason may be that the electrogenic bacteria in the samples of mfc smx acted synergistically with the functional bacteria that degraded smx which stabilized the species diversity the ordinate of the sparse curve was the diversity index sobs value the curves tended to be flat indicating that the sequencing data was reasonable and could reflect the information of most microorganisms in the samples 37 the sobs index of all smx mfc samples is higher than that of smx samples which is consistent with the previous analysis fig 11a in pca analysis the community differences of pc1 axis and pc2 axis were 75 99 and 23 23 respectively indicating that smx had a great effect on the microbial community composition and that the electric field induction promoted the microbial diversity in the environment the samples of bs and mfc smx gathered on the left side while the samples of smx gathered on the right side which were far away from each other however the smx samples and mfc smx samples still had a high degree of similarity fig 11b indicating that both smx and the electric field environment would affect the microbial community structure veen plots were used to assess the similarity and difference between different samples based on otu level as shown in fig 11c the total number of otus in the three samples is 798 indicating that there are similar microbial communities among the three systems which may be due to the same growth substrate in the process of acclimation and the anaerobic environment some studies 38 have shown that different parts of a unique otu result in different microbial communities and smx degradation rates between systems the number of otus unique to mfc smx 559 was greater than that unique to smx 177 which may be due to the excellent affinity and biocompatibility of mfc anode material which increases microbial activity and abundance in this environment the alliance effect between exclusive and shared otus leads to different microbial communities and increases the degradation rate of smx fig 11d shows the abundance differences of community structures of different samples on otus it can also be seen from the figure that there are differences in the richness of the three samples in order to further analyze the differences between different samples the horizontal circos diagram of the door was analyzed fig 12a the composition and relative abundance of dominant bacteria differed between the three samples the microbial compositions of bs samples were mainly actinobacteria 30 78 proteobacteria 35 73 bacteroidetes 30 06 firmicutes 16 86 and chloroflexi 50 28 compared with the samples of smx and mfc smx the relative abundance of firmicutes increased to 31 59 and 51 55 respectively and firmicutes became the dominant species in the samples of mfc smx this indicates that the bacterial community can well adapt to an environment polluted by high concentrations of smx and firmicutes is related to pollutant degradation and power generation in bioelectrochemical systems and is one of the most electric producing microorganisms studied so far 45 compared with smx samples in the mfc smx samples the dominant bacteria turned into proteobacteria 37 11 and bacteroidetes 40 47 while the abundance of actinobactreia decreased to 19 57 these findings indicated that they were significantly enriched as dominant bacteria in the mfc environment in the anode chamber studies 35 have found that proteobacteria have certain advantages in the degradation of refractory pollutants and can degrade high concentration antibiotic wastewater and generate electricity at the same time bacteroidetes play an important role in antibiotic degradation additionally the relative abundances of euryarchaeota and synergistetes considerably rose from 3 42 and 6 86 to 74 29 and 58 58 respectively it is established that the experimental system is a strictly anaerobic environment because the growth requirements for this particular type of bacteria demand an anaerobic environment community structure was explored at the genus level with heat maps fig 12b showing the first 30 species in terms of community composition at the subordinate level the bs samples were propioniciclava 9 98 fusibacter 1 97 micropruina 4 48 and kouleothrix 3 74 after acclimation with smx for a period of time the relative abundance of propioniciclava in smx samples increased to 25 66 the relative abundance of other bacteria decreased significantly due to antibiotic inhibition in the mfc smx samples fusibacter was the dominant strain with the highest abundance followed by propioniciclava and methanosarcina comparing the community structure of smx samples the relative abundances of propioniciclava and acinetobacter decreased from 25 66 and 4 65 to 3 86 and 0 19 respectively however propioniciclava is still the dominant bacterium in the sample of mfc smx which is consistent with the previous conclusions research shows that desulfovibrio 1 39 is a bacterium with electric capacity and is playing an important role in the process of electron transfer 1 so the electricity producing bacteria in mdc smx are likely to be fusibacter desulfovibrio and methanosarcina in addition the complex interactions between functional bacteria also play an important role in mfc power generation performance and antibiotic degradation 21 4 conclusion in this study waste biomass was recycled and carbonized as the base electrode material feco bimetal and nitrogen co doped for the modification of mfc anode fe co n bc modified anode material has good biocompatibility and efficient electron transfer ability the results of mfc operation confirmed that the maximum power density of the anode mfc output reached 1181 61 mw m2 which was 5 73 times that of the unmodified anode during the test period the modified anode mfc ran more stably the performance of mfc was significantly improved and the degradation rate of smx was increased by 53 23 through studying the changes and diversity of microbial community composition in different systems it was found that there were significant differences in the microbial community and species richness was significantly increased the results show that fe co n bc modified anode is a potential new anode which can significantly improve the overall performance of mfc at the same time the resource recovery reduces the production cost of mfc electrode and further promotes the industrial application of mfc declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

12584,sulfamethoxazole smx a common antibiotic is commonly used to treat urinary tract infections and intestine infections caused by sensitive bacteria water pollution is exacerbated as a result of its abuse and discharge the feasibility and advantage of using microbial fuel cells mfc to degrade sulfamethoxazole have been proved however mfc is limited in wastewater treatment due to low bioelectric catalytic efficacy and expensive electrode costs in this research high performance fe co n bc anode materials were prepared by bimetal and n doping to improve the electrochemical performance and biocompatibility of the electrodes and fe co n bc anode mfc was applied to the degradation of smx the results show that the mfc of fe co n bc anode has the lowest internal resistance 144 46 ω greatly improves the electrical performance and the maximum degradation rate of smx reaches 89 1 which is 2 1 times that of a conventional anaerobic reactor the results show that fe co n bc anode has good physicochemical properties and the fe co n bc anode mfc reactor can effectively degrade smx keywords microbial fuel cells anode smx degradation mfc performance microbial community characteristics data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction as one of the typical antibiotics sulfamethoxazole smx is widely used in the treatment of urinary tract infection intestinal infection biliary tract infection and other diseases caused by sensitive bacteria 8 in recent years due to its abuse and discharge it has caused serious water environment pollution 20 due to the characteristics of refractory and persistent the smx discharged into water bodies tend to accumulate gradually which will cause serious damage to the ecosystem and human health 40 with the high frequency detection of smx in groundwater and surface water the environmental pollution caused by antibiotic smx is becoming increasingly prominent therefore how to treat smx in wastewater with effective methods is very important 42 bioelectrochemical system bes is a combination of microbial technology and electrochemical technology which can realize simultaneous wastewater treatment and energy recovery 3 in the face of increasingly severe energy crisis and environmental pollution researchers have made a lot of efforts to develop a variety of bes such as microbial fuel cells and microbial reverse electrodialysis cells mfc mrc electricity production 16 microbial electrolytic cells mec h2 formation 29 microbial electrosynthesis cells mesc chemical synthesis 17 and microbial desalinity tank mdc seawater desalination etc 31 44 it can be found that significant scientific progress has been made in understanding the reaction mechanism of microbial electrochemical systems and developing efficient materials 2 32 in recent years the development of mfc technology has made great progress 5 28 based on the exploration of the basic principle of mfc the optimization of system performance and the research of the practical application of mfc as well as the coupling of mfc with other technologies to realize the effective utilization of electric energy has become a research hotspot in order to meet the standards of high performance and low cost in the actual environment 33 more and more attention has been paid to the use of mfcs to degrade smx 27 41 some scholars 46 used the coupling of constructed wetlands and microbial fuel cells cw mfcs to drive the smx elimination in bes for research the results indicate that the main degradation pathway of smx is biotransformation smx at 30 mg l was rapidly degraded in the cw mfcs system while the low current had no effect on the degradation products but improved the removal rate of smx miran 23 used mfc batch mode to treat different initial concentrations of smx the results showed that the degradation rate of smx increased from 0 67 μmol h to 13 36 μmol h as the initial concentration of smx increased from 0 04 mmol l to 0 79 mmol l therefore how to efficiently treat antibiotics while achieving electricity production and resource recovery has become one of the most urgent problems in the field of bioelectrochemistry the fundamental component of bacterial enrichment electron collection and conduction in mfc is the anode the structure and chemical properties of anode materials have effects on electron transport anode impedance and microbial adhesion and these effects limit anode performance and mfc high power production 26 many academics have been working on ways to enhance anode performance recently including using better catalysts and reaction medium 10 11 enhancing the anode arrangement 25 connecting the metal collector fluid 14 etc some researchers have improved the performance of mfc by modifying anode materials lowy et al 22 used fe3o4 and fe3 ni modified graphite felt plate anodes to produce 1 7 to 2 2 times more energy than unmodified graphite anodes mohamed et al 24 deposited fe fe2o3 on the surface of different carbon based materials by electrodeposition which improved the microbial adhesion on the electrode surface and reduced the electron transfer resistance at present the research on improving the performance of mfc anode materials is still limited by many limitations and the application of bimetal and heteroatom codoped anode materials in mfc is still lacking a gel solid anode material was prepared in this study by co doping waste biomass chinese medicine residue with fe co n and then used in an mfc anode mfc was used to study the wastewater containing smx antibiotics and to explore the influencing factors degradation efficiency and degradation pathways of smx degradation by this system in addition this paper also explored the changes in microbial community characteristics during the degradation of smx in the mfc system by optimizing the preparation of mfc anode material the start up time of mfc is shortened and the power density and other electrical properties are improved so as to improve the practical application of mfc in water treatment which is limited by low power 2 materials and methods 2 1 the preparation of fe co n bc bc biochar is the chinese medicine residue containing radix astragalus radix huangbai rhizoctonia chinensis etc which is crushed through a 100 mesh sieve and placed in a tubular furnace filled with n2 for reserve use the pyrolysis temperature is 800 c for 2 h and then ground through a 325 mesh sieve fecl3 6h2o and cocl2 6h2o with a molar ratio of 2 1 were added to the hydrothermal reaction medium glycerol and the mixture was stirred to fully dissolve the materials were pyrolyzed in a hydrothermal reaction kettle at a temperature of 200 c for 8 h after the ph was adjusted to 13 after removing the samples the samples were washed with deionized water and absolute ethanol for three times and the powder cofe2o4 was obtained by drying and grinding quantitative bc and different amounts of cofe2o4 were dissolved in 5 ml of formaldehyde and stirred for 10 min after 20 min of ultrasonography melamine was added and mixed for 20 min in a water bath at 60 c the white powder was removed 1 ml of ammonium formaldehyde citrate was added and 0 2 ml of acetic acid 30 mg l was added after 3 min the fe co n bc precursor was prepared after drying by stirring continuously until it became a black gel the pyrolysis was maintained at 900 c for 2 h in a tube furnace filled with n2 to obtain fe co n bc fig 1 as a control group n bc was not doped with feco 2 2 sludge inoculation and mfc operation the lanzhou sewage treatment plant provided the inoculated sludge and the nutrient solution was changed every four days c6h12o6 was used as the substrate and the smx directed anaerobes were cultured and acclimated in a constant temperature oscillator after culture and acclimation at 5 mg l smx for a period of time the concentration of smx in the culture medium was successively increased from 5 mg l to 30 mg l they were cultured and domesticated separately for a period of time by using the liquid phase to measure the degradation of smx it was discovered that the rate of smx degradation in the acclimation bottle did not change significantly over time demonstrating that the acclimation of smx degrading bacteria was complete and could be used for mfc inoculation as shown in fig 2 an h type two compartment fuel cell device with a proton exchange membrane separating the two compartments was used in this study and the volume of each chamber was 100 ml the graphite plate

co n bc precursor fig 3 3413 cm 1 is a nh 2340 cm 1 is the absorption peak of co2 in the air 1546 cm 1 is the stretching vibration peak of co and 1200 cm 1 is the asymmetric stretching vibration peak of c o c 30 the results show that by doping spinel cofe2o4 the hydroxymethylated prepolymer is formed by reacting with bc formaldehyde solution and melamine it was then esterified with an ammonium formaldehyde citrate solution so that cofe2o4 was closely combined with the prepolymer under the catalysis of glacial acetic acid the polycondensation reaction was accelerated thus forming a thermosetting polymer uniformly coated with cross linked biochar after the pyrolysis of the fe co n bc precursor in a tubular furnace the morphology and microstructure of the material were observed by sem and tem as shown in fig 4 it can be observed from fig 4a b that the surface of the n bc sample is relatively smooth without obvious particles indicating that the bc particles are coated by cross linked pyrolysis products in fig 4c d it can be observed that cofe2o4 and bc particles are uniformly dispersed in the polymer structure and the material morphology is circular compared with the sem of n bc samples the introduction of feco significantly changed the structural morphology of the anode material from smooth to rough this structural morphology increases the surface roughness and enhances the attachment and growth of microorganisms on the surface of the anode material fig 4e f show that there are circular particles of tens of nanometers in size distributed everywhere indicating that the shape of the sample is basically spherical the crystal plane spacing shown in the figure is 0 20 nm which is consistent with the crystal plane spacing of co3fe7 crystal 110 9 in order to analyze the chemical composition and valence state of the electrode sample surface elements xps test was carried out on the prepared fe co n bc material in the high resolution co 2p spectrum fig 5a the co 2p spectrum of fe co n bc splits into 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 double peaks due to spin orbit coupling the co 2p features of fe co n bc correspond to the characteristic peaks of co2 2p3 2 780 46 ev and 2p1 2 795 71 ev and co3 2p3 2 782 07 ev and 2p1 2 796 62 ev accompanied by two satellite peaks 7 similarly in the fe 2p spectrum fig 5b fe2 2p3 2 peak at 710 31 ev fe3 2p3 2 peak at 712 83 ev fe2 2p1 2 peak at 723 01 ev and fe3 2p1 2 peak at 725 01 ev 39 the peaks of the satellite peaks were 718 12 ev and 726 43 ev respectively fig 5c shows the xrd pattern of the prepared sample compared with bc samples it is found that the diffraction peaks of n bc and fe co n bc materials appear at 26 indicating that the pyrolytic materials have a certain degree of graphitization in the obtained fe co n bc material diffraction peaks of 44 72 110 and 65 18 200 are found in the xrd pattern which is completely consistent with the standard card of co3fe7 pdf no 48 1817 19 indicating that co3fe7 crystal is formed after fe and co pyrolysis 3 1 2 electrochemical and mfc performance analysis of the fe co n bc anode after the successful start up of mfc when the nutrient solution of mfc meets the growth of microorganisms the maximum voltage output can maintain a relatively stable state for a period of time which proves that mfc has reached a stable stage 34 a data collector is used to collect voltage data every 10 min and draw the voltage change curve with time fig 5d which reflects the voltage change of mfc in 25 days of operation in the stable phase fe co n bc anode can reach more than 500 mv and the maximum voltage that can be reached is 619 33 mv the same as n bc it takes about 6 days of activation period to reach the stable output voltage 552 mv and the stable period is about 4 days although the maximum output stable voltage of n bc reaches 528 mv the stable period only takes about 1 day to decline and the output cycle time is short the results show that feco doping affects the maximum stable voltage and the output time of the battery to maintain the stable voltage as can be seen from fig 6a the prepared fe co n bc anode generates a higher current density than other anodes and the open circuit voltages of mfc are bc 0 652 v n bc 0 717 v and fe co n bc 0 836 v respectively the maximum output power density of the anode electrode mfc was bc 206 mw m2 n bc 663 mw m2 and fe co n bc 1181 61 mw m2 respectively n bc anode mfc and fe co n bc anode mfc have maximum power densities that are 3 22 times and 5 73 times higher than bc anode mfc respectively obviously an anode doped with fe co n can significantly increase the output power of mfc 43 in fig 6b the prepared fe co n bc 4 67a m2 anode produced the highest current density followed by n bc 2 17a m2 and bc 1 21a m2 anodes indicating that fe co n bc anode had a low polarization the polarization curves in the figure all have three sections active polarization ohmic polarization and concentration polarization mfc is mainly ohmic polarization the maximum power density appears in the ohmic polarization region and the voltage drop is always decreasing during the whole discharge process the ohm polarization region in the polarization curve is fitted and the slope of the line represents the apparent internal resistance 4 as can be seen from the figure the slope of the fe co n bc anode curve is the smallest indicating that the polarization trend of the cell is the slowest the ohmic polarization region fitting results of the polarization curves of mfcs with different anodes show that the constructed mfc reaction device has different apparent internal resistances as shown in table 1 according to the polarization curve fitting calculation of different anodes the mfc internal resistance of the fe co n bc anode is the least 144 46 ω followed by n bc 269 65 ω and bc 537 84 ω previous preliminary studies of the h shape mfc have shown that their limitations are high internal resistance values making it difficult to distinguish their performance differences 13 it can be seen from the above data that doping with appropriate amount of bimetal and nitrogen can reduce the apparent internal resistance of mfc device and effectively improve the electrical performance of mfc 18 after the anode of the reaction device was successfully started and operated stably for four cycles the biofilm on the electrode surface was formed and stably existed cv test was conducted on all the mfc reaction devices and the results were shown in fig 6c the fe co n bc anode has the largest cv curve area which indicates that the microbial activity of generating electricity on the electrode is strong the current density generated by fe co n bc 9 40 ma m2 anode mfc was 1 93 times that of n bc anode 4 86 ma m2 indicating that feco and n co doped anode materials promoted extracellular electron transport fig 6d shows the eis measured by an electrochemical workstation after the biofilm of the mfc anode was formed and stabilized and the eis amplified by the mfc of the n bc fe co n bc anode the eigenvalues of ohm internal resistance rs charge transfer resistance rct and diffusion internal resistance rw can be obtained by equivalent fitting of the external circuit table 2 by comparing different anode materials it is found that the rs value 8 66 ω of the anode mfc doped with feco is between the rs value of bc and n bc and the rct value of the anode mfc doped with feco is lower than the resistance value of bc and n bc anode mfc the rct of the bc anode mfc is 109 89 times that of the fe co n bc anode these results indicate that appropriate nitrogen doping can effectively promote electron transport between the electrode and the electrogenic microorganism the rct of the n bc also decreased with a value of 5 79 ω this indicates that the amount of feco doping will affect the charge transfer of electrons generated by electrogenic microorganisms between the anode and the protein membrane this result indicates that the mfc at the fe co n bc anode has a faster electron transport process between the surface and the microorganism 3 2 degradation efficiency of smx by different anodes of mfc using sodium acetate as substrate the smx degradation ability of different anode mfcs was investigated in three different anode materials bc mfc 1 fe co n bc mfc 2 and conventional anaerobic reactor occ under open circuit condition according to fig 7a on the third day of operation the smx degradation concentrations of mfc 1 mfc 2 and occ are 16 79 mg l 13 04 mg l and 28 50 mg l respectively on the fifth day the maximum degradation rate of mfc in mfc 2 reached 87 5 the degradation rates of smx by all mfcs were 1 71 times mfc 1 and 1 91 times mfc 2 that of the occ respectively the reason for this difference may be that feco doping increases the roughness of the surface of the prepared fe co n bc anode material making it easier for microorganisms to attach and grow on the surface of the anode material the bacteria on the anode consume the substrate while also supplying the electrons needed to break down smx at the same time the degradation of antibiotic smx by conventional anaerobic microbial reactor is limited fig 7b shows the variation trend of smx degradation after six cycles of reactor operation the degradation rates of smx in mfc 1 mfc 2 and occ were 80 76 2 48 91 06 1 96 and 41 79 1 78 respectively the mfc anode chamber significantly improved smx degradation indicating that the electrons released by microorganisms in the mfc reactor when they consumed sodium acetate provided favorable conditions for sn bond breaking during smx degradation the removal effect of fe co n bc anode mfc on organic matter was significant indicating that the rate of sodium acetate consumed by electricity producing microorganisms was accelerated therefore the more electrons provided for smx degradation the higher the degradation rate of smx set the concentration of smx at 30 mg l and the ph value at 7 to study the degradation rate and kinetic characteristics of smx in different reactors the first sample was taken 12 h after the nutrient was added to the reactor and then samples were taken every 12 h to detect the concentration of smx in the effluent as shown in fig 7c the degradation rate of smx by mfc 1 was fast in the first 24 h and the degradation rate reached about 50 while occ was only 26 78 a first order kinetic model was used to simulate the smx degradation process by conventional anaerobic reactions with mfc at different anodes fig 7d shows that smx degradation processes in different systems are all in line with first order kinetic equations and the correlation coefficients r2 of mfc systems are all around 0 96 indicating that the curve fitting degree of the two reactors is high in table 3 the k values of different reaction devices increased gradually during the degradation of smx and the reaction rate constant of the mfc 1 was 0 0229 which was more obvious than that of the occ according to the calculation the half lives of smx degradation by mfc 1 and mfc 2 are 37 31 h and 30 15 h respectively while the half lives of smx degradation by occ are 3 39 4 2 times that of mfc this indicates that the higher the number of electrons produced on the anode during the same reaction time the stronger the ability of mfc to degrade smx 3 3 analysis of influencing factors the initial concentration of smx may affect the tolerance of microorganisms four groups of reactors were set up with initial concentrations of 10 20 30 and 40 mg l respectively two parallel reactors were set in each group and other conditions were consistent after the mfc system operated stably for two cycles the effects of different initial concentrations of smx on the degradation effect were investigated fig 8a shows the change of smx concentration over time in mfc reactors with initial concentrations of 10 mg l and 20 mg l the smx degradation concentration reached half of the initial concentration on day 1 and only 0 73 mg l and 1 88 mg l on day 5 in addition the mfc reactor with an initial concentration of 30 mg l degraded half of the original smx on day 2 while 40 mg l degraded half of the original smx for the longest time the results showed that the higher the initial concentration of smx the greater the impact on microbial metabolism in mfc fig 8b shows that on the 5th day degradation rates of 10 20 30 and 40 mg l of smx were 92 71 90 62 90 01 and 84 26 respectively with the increase of initial concentration the degradation rate of smx gradually decreased indicating that the raw inoculated sludge obtained from a sewage treatment plant after acclimation can play a good role in the degradation and removal of smx in conclusion it is feasible for mfc to degrade smx at different initial concentrations it has been shown that ph values affect the electrochemical effects and performance of mfcs and also play an important role in the degradation of smx 6 12 four groups of experiments with ph 6 6 5 7 and 7 5 were set up with two parallel experiments in each group the concentration of smx was 30 mg l and other conditions were consistent after the mfc system ran smoothly for two cycles the effects of mfc on smx degradation under different ph conditions were investigated fig 8c shows the change of smx degradation concentration by mfc over time under different ph conditions with the change of environmental ph the degradation concentration of smx by mfc also changes on the first day of degradation at ph 6 6 5 7 and 7 5 the degradation concentration of smx by mfc was 20 76 mg l 18 59 mg l 13 26 mg l and 23 18 mg l respectively only the degradation concentration of smx at ph 7 was the lowest and reached half of the original on the second day of degradation the smx degradation concentration of the mfc reactor at ph 6 reached half of the original concentration while that of the mfc reactor at ph 7 5 reached half of the original concentration only on the third day the results showed that the mfc reactor could inhibit the degradation efficiency of smx under acidic or alkaline conditions in fig 8d at ph 6 6 5 7 and 7 5 the corresponding smx degradation rates are 77 02 86 56 90 33 and 73 65 respectively under the conditions of ph 6 5 and 7 the degradation rate of smx by mfc was above 85 and the degradation rate of smx by mfc at ph 7 was the highest this may be because in the mfc anode reaction chamber the h provided under acidic conditions improves the mass transfer efficiency while the oh will react with h under alkaline conditions to reduce the mass transfer efficiency the above experimental results indicate that in the mfc anode reaction chamber the degradation efficiency of smx is higher under weak acidic or neutral conditions especially in the neutral environment 3 4 analysis of degradation products and degradation paths by analyzing the liquid chromatography of degradation products at different time stages the peak height of the target pollutants gradually decreases with the passage of time and the peak time of smx is about 4 14 min before this peak position there is also the formation of substances and the peak height increases with the passage of time indicating that the parent is gradually transforming into intermediate products the effluent samples of the 30 mg l smx system in mfc 2 were selected for the product analysis and the degradation mechanism as shown in fig 9 the peak of mass charge ratio m z 253 18 is the peak of smx but the intensity is very low indicating that the mfc reactor can significantly degrade smx table 4 shows that the deduced molecular formula chemical structure formula and mass to charge ratio of smx and its degradation intermediates in mfc anodic effluent were analyzed by comparison with the standard spectrogram the material with a mass to charge ratio of 254 was identified as the parent smx and nine transformation products of smx p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 p6 p7 p8 and p9 were identified the two substances with a mass to charge ratio of 173 and 136 were inferred to be sulfanilamide and acetanilide by the mass spectrogram p1 p2 p3 and p4 are formed by sn bond cleavage p6 is an intermediate formed by the smx coupling reaction fig 10 shows two pathways of smx degradation in the anode chamber of mfc path i smx is attacked by oh resulting in the formation of p1 and p3 after an sn bond fracture the amino group of p1 is oxidized to form the nitroso derivative s1 which is further oxidized to form the nitroso product p2 since the anode chamber of mfc is an anaerobic environment the oxidation conditions cannot be met and it is difficult to produce a large amount of s1 and p2 in the anode chamber p3 is further hydroxylated to form p4 path ii smx coupling reaction results in the formation of a symmetrical long chain p5 containing two benzene rings which is subsequently similar to the degradation pathway of path i where s2 is transformed into s3 and then transformed into sulfa p6 by nn fracture p6 is cleaved to form p7 4 amino 2 butanol which is easily degraded by microorganisms due to its chain like structure and further transformed into p8 n butanol and p9 butane and finally mineralized into methane co2 etc under anoxic conditions 3 5 microbial diversity analysis the experiment analyzed the microbial community characteristics of the original inoculated sludge bs smx acclimated sludge smx and smx degraded biofilm sludge mfc smx in the anode chamber of mfc the structural succession and functional changes of microbial communities were investigated under different conditions table 5 lists a series of diversity index values sobs shannon simpson and coverage coverage is used to estimate the coverage of each sample library the higher the value the lower the probability that the sequence in the sample is not detected 36 the coverage values of the three samples were greater than 90 indicating that the sequencing results accurately reflected the biological characteristics of the samples the larger the shannon index is and the smaller the simpson index is the higher the microbial diversity of the sample is the higher shannon index 7 6900 and lower simpson index 0 9444 were found in the samples of mfc smx indicating the higher species abundance and diversity of mfc smx the reason may be that the electrogenic bacteria in the samples of mfc smx acted synergistically with the functional bacteria that degraded smx which stabilized the species diversity the ordinate of the sparse curve was the diversity index sobs value the curves tended to be flat indicating that the sequencing data was reasonable and could reflect the information of most microorganisms in the samples 37 the sobs index of all smx mfc samples is higher than that of smx samples which is consistent with the previous analysis fig 11a in pca analysis the community differences of pc1 axis and pc2 axis were 75 99 and 23 23 respectively indicating that smx had a great effect on the microbial community composition and that the electric field induction promoted the microbial diversity in the environment the samples of bs and mfc smx gathered on the left side while the samples of smx gathered on the right side which were far away from each other however the smx samples and mfc smx samples still had a high degree of similarity fig 11b indicating that both smx and the electric field environment would affect the microbial community structure veen plots were used to assess the similarity and difference between different samples based on otu level as shown in fig 11c the total number of otus in the three samples is 798 indicating that there are similar microbial communities among the three systems which may be due to the same growth substrate in the process of acclimation and the anaerobic environment some studies 38 have shown that different parts of a unique otu result in different microbial communities and smx degradation rates between systems the number of otus unique to mfc smx 559 was greater than that unique to smx 177 which may be due to the excellent affinity and biocompatibility of mfc anode material which increases microbial activity and abundance in this environment the alliance effect between exclusive and shared otus leads to different microbial communities and increases the degradation rate of smx fig 11d shows the abundance differences of community structures of different samples on otus it can also be seen from the figure that there are differences in the richness of the three samples in order to further analyze the differences between different samples the horizontal circos diagram of the door was analyzed fig 12a the composition and relative abundance of dominant bacteria differed between the three samples the microbial compositions of bs samples were mainly actinobacteria 30 78 proteobacteria 35 73 bacteroidetes 30 06 firmicutes 16 86 and chloroflexi 50 28 compared with the samples of smx and mfc smx the relative abundance of firmicutes increased to 31 59 and 51 55 respectively and firmicutes became the dominant species in the samples of mfc smx this indicates that the bacterial community can well adapt to an environment polluted by high concentrations of smx and firmicutes is related to pollutant degradation and power generation in bioelectrochemical systems and is one of the most electric producing microorganisms studied so far 45 compared with smx samples in the mfc smx samples the dominant bacteria turned into proteobacteria 37 11 and bacteroidetes 40 47 while the abundance of actinobactreia decreased to 19 57 these findings indicated that they were significantly enriched as dominant bacteria in the mfc environment in the anode chamber studies 35 have found that proteobacteria have certain advantages in the degradation of refractory pollutants and can degrade high concentration antibiotic wastewater and generate electricity at the same time bacteroidetes play an important role in antibiotic degradation additionally the relative abundances of euryarchaeota and synergistetes considerably rose from 3 42 and 6 86 to 74 29 and 58 58 respectively it is established that the experimental system is a strictly anaerobic environment because the growth requirements for this particular type of bacteria demand an anaerobic environment community structure was explored at the genus level with heat maps fig 12b showing the first 30 species in terms of community composition at the subordinate level the bs samples were propioniciclava 9 98 fusibacter 1 97 micropruina 4 48 and kouleothrix 3 74 after acclimation with smx for a period of time the relative abundance of propioniciclava in smx samples increased to 25 66 the relative abundance of other bacteria decreased significantly due to antibiotic inhibition in the mfc smx samples fusibacter was the dominant strain with the highest abundance followed by propioniciclava and methanosarcina comparing the community structure of smx samples the relative abundances of propioniciclava and acinetobacter decreased from 25 66 and 4 65 to 3 86 and 0 19 respectively however propioniciclava is still the dominant bacterium in the sample of mfc smx which is consistent with the previous conclusions research shows that desulfovibrio 1 39 is a bacterium with electric capacity and is playing an important role in the process of electron transfer 1 so the electricity producing bacteria in mdc smx are likely to be fusibacter desulfovibrio and methanosarcina in addition the complex interactions between functional bacteria also play an important role in mfc power generation performance and antibiotic degradation 21 4 conclusion in this study waste biomass was recycled and carbonized as the base electrode material feco bimetal and nitrogen co doped for the modification of mfc anode fe co n bc modified anode material has good biocompatibility and efficient electron transfer ability the results of mfc operation confirmed that the maximum power density of the anode mfc output reached 1181 61 mw m2 which was 5 73 times that of the unmodified anode during the test period the modified anode mfc ran more stably the performance of mfc was significantly improved and the degradation rate of smx was increased by 53 23 through studying the changes and diversity of microbial community composition in different systems it was found that there were significant differences in the microbial community and species richness was significantly increased the results show that fe co n bc modified anode is a potential new anode which can significantly improve the overall performance of mfc at the same time the resource recovery reduces the production cost of mfc electrode and further promotes the industrial application of mfc declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
