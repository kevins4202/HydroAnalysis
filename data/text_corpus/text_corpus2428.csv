spectroscopy ft ir x ray diffraction xrd and proximate and ultimate analysis the total surface area and pore structural parameters of the synthesized activated carbon sac were determined by surface area analysis using quantachrome surface analyser surface morphology of raw and dye loaded adsorbent was investigated with the aid of field emission scanning electron microscopic analysis using zeiss evo operated at 20 kv accelerated voltage and magnification of 1kx along with edx energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy analysis ftir was conducted to determine physio chemical and conformational changes of functional groups on surface as well as in bulk phase after modification reflectance spectrum was performed for wavenumber ranging from 400 to 4000 cm 1 with a high resolution of 4 cm 1 using thermoscientific nicolet is50 attenuated total reflectance fourier transform spectroscopy atr ftir the crystallinity was measured using x ray diffraction xpert pro pan alytical model the

determine ash carbon moisture and volatile contents using tappi standards elemental analysis was performed using elemental vario el cube analyser to determine total carbon c nitrogen n hydrogen h contents 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of synthesized activated carbon sac 3 1 1 surface morphology the surface morphology of synthesized activated carbon sac before and after dye loading was recorded through fe sem analysis fig 1 b and c demonstrates the significant changes in textural and porous features of adsorbent before and after accumulation of dye molecules on the surface of adsorbent under magnification of 1 kx at a particle size of 100 μm the well developed cavernous porous structure was observed in the micrograph which may assist in adsorbing large amount of dye molecules from synthetic aqueous solution on the surface of adsorbent also morphological changes in synthesized activated carbon were also supported by bet brunauer emmett teller analysis that shows high surface area and is summarized in table 1 results revealed that synthetic activated carbon has maximum surface area of 540 13 m2 g having total pore volume of 1 97 cm3 g with an average pore size of 0 93 nm confirming large and porous structure in addition elemental analysis of synthesized and dye loaded activated carbon was determined using edx energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy analysis the recorded spectra revealed the presence of carbon 42 12 oxygen 30 76 and sulphur 27 12 elements in synthesized activated carbon as shown in fig 1 a whereas fig 1 b shows the presence of carbon 22 12 oxygen 15 76 sulphur 18 12 sodium 21 13 and calcium 22 87 elements in congo red dye loaded activated carbon spectra similarly fig 1 c shows presence of carbon 20 12 oxygen 18 76 sulphur 12 12 sodium 18 13 potassium 8 01 and calcium 22 86 elements in methylene blue dye loaded activated carbon spectra these results revealed that synthesized activated carbon has high content of carbon oxygen and sulphur elements due to chemical activation of vetiveria zizanioides with h2so4 whereas dye loaded activated carbon shows less content of carbon oxygen and sulphur elements due to the adsorption of dye ions on the surface of activated carbon as a results dye loaded adsorbent shows the combined spectra including other elements such as sodium and potassium 3 1 2 ft ir analysis fig 2 shows ft ir spectra of synthesized and dye loaded activated carbon results clearly revealed stretching broadening of peaks as a result of stretching of functional groups after adsorption of congo red fig 2b and methylene blue fig 2c dye on the surface of synthesized activated carbon adsorbent in general methylene blue and congo red dye loaded adsorbent shows significant modification due to the adsorption of dyes on the surface of activated carbon it was observed that peaks around 3601 3347 cm 1 attributes the presence of more intense and broad peaks in both dye loaded adsorbent as compared to synthesized activated carbon that results in stretching vibration of hydroxyl functional groups tan et al 2008a it may be due to the involvement of hydrogen of oh group that forms surface complex with intra molecular hydrogen bonding and thus facilitates adsorption of dye molecules onto the surface of synthesized activated carbon adsorbent the sharp adsorption band at around 2820 cm 1 in both dye loaded adsorbent corresponds to the symmetric c h stretching of alkane group whereas peaks near 2399 cm 1 corresponds to methoxy band that confirms faster dye removal using vetiveria zizaniodes derived activated carbon however in case of synthesized activated carbon less intense and weak peak was observed as compared to dye loaded activated carbon also broad peak at around 1750 cm 1 confirms the strong stretching of cc stretching of alkynes in both the dye loaded adsorbent whereas disappearance of this peak was observed in synthesized activated carbon in addition adsorption of peaks near 1660 1332 cm 1 confirms the vibrational stretching of co in lactones ketones carboxylic acid group and stretching of cc of aromatic ring in both the dye loaded adsorbent whereas less intense peaks were observed in case of synthesized activated carbon adsorbent kumar et al 2019 also stretching of alcohols c o and amine group n h bend was confirmed by sharp peaks present in the range of 1088 1154 cm 1and 810 881 cm 1 respectively mall et al 2005 santhy and selvapathy 2006 singh et al 2017 in dye loaded activated carbon however disappearance of these peaks was observed in synthesized activated carbon these aforementioned peaks in ft ir spectrum of synthesized and dye loaded activated carbon confirms the physico chemical and conformational modification this may be due to the possibility of adsorbate and adsorbent interaction ion exchange and surface complexation that occurs during adsorption of methylene blue and congo red on the surface of synthesized activated carbon 3 1 3 proximate and ultimate analysis table 1 summarizes the percentage composition of moisture content volatile matter ash and carbon content in synthesized activated carbon determined as reported in our previous work tyagi and khandegar 2018 it was observed that synthesized activated carbon contains 9 3 of moisture content 1 8 of ash content 76 6 of volatile matter and 12 3 of carbon content the carbon content is more than 10 in the resulted adsorbent that clearly justifies the acceptability of adsorbent as green bio adsorbent for the removal of dyes from synthetic wastewater also percentage composition of elemental analysis summarized in table 1 shows that synthesized activated carbon sac contain high carbon content i e 45 13 and oxygen content was found to be 40 75 with low contents of hydrogen and nitrogen 3 1 4 xrd analysis xrd analysis was performed to determine the crystalline structure of vetiveria zizanioides derived activated carbon fig 3 shows sharp and narrow diffraction peak near 2θ of 23 that corresponds to 002 carbon diffraction the development of sharp diffraction peak indicates the presence of microcrystalline structure that occurred after acid h2so4 activation during pyrolysis of vetiveria zizanioides namasivayam and kavitha 2002 also peak near 2θ of 23 resembles the same structure as graphite microcrystalline structure that helps in fast adsorption of dyes from synthetic solution 3 2 pyrolysis study pyrolysis of vetiveria zizanioides was performed for the effective production of activated carbon and its wide usage for the removal of dyes from aqueous solution literature reports that pyrolysis process is mainly influenced by two variables pyrolysis temperature and flow rate of sweep gas therefore in the present work initial experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of these process variables for the effective production of activated carbon 3 2 1 effect of pyrolysis temperature fig 4 shows the effect of temperature on the yield of pyrolysis products using vetiveria zizanioides having particle size of 20 mesh and sweep gas n2 flow rate of 100 cm3 min 1 it was observed that on increasing the temperature from 350 c to 550 c liquid yield increases from 31 09 to 67 76 and char yield increases from 28 67 to 60 12 further increase in temperature to 700 c liquid and char yield gradually decreases to 39 99 and 36 21 respectively however with the increase in temperature from 350 c to 700 c gas yield continuously increases from 24 125 to 59 01 results revealed that with the increase in temperature char yield decreases because char material decompose at higher temperature and hence decreases char yield in contrast gradual decrease in liquid yield with increase in temperature attributes to the increase in secondary volatile decomposition of intermediate hydrocarbons beis et al 2002 kader et al 2013 3 2 2 effect of sweep gas n2 flow rate fig 5 shows the variation in the yield of pyrolysis products using different sweep gas n2 flow rate ranging from 50 to 350 cm3 min 1 with particle size of 20 mesh and pyrolysis temperature of 550 c it can be observed that on increasing sweep gas flow rate from 50 cm3 min 1 to 100 cm3 min 1 liquid yield increases from 63 12 to 67 76 and char yield increases from 54 99 to 60 12 respectively however further increase in sweep gas flow rate to 350 cm3 min 1 liquid yield decreases to 42 01 and char yield increases to 75 01 respectively this may be due to the fact that at high sweep gas flow rate low residence time is available for cracking of long chain of biomass matrix i e cellulose hemi cellulose and lignin to lower hydrocarbons hence decrease liquid yield and thus high flow rate of sweep gas leads to high yield of char also significant increase in the gas yield was observed from 43 34 to 69 23 with the increase in sweep gas flow rate from 50 cm3 min 1 to 100 cm3 min 1 respectively due to insufficient condensation of hot vapours zaror et al 1985 ertas and alma 2010 3 3 adsorption study 3 3 1 effect of solution ph solution ph influence the surface properties of the bio adsorbent by modulating degree of ionisation of the functional groups present in the dye and helps in significant removal of dye from wastewater the effect of solution ph ranging from 1 to 12 was investigated on the adsorption of methylene blue and congo red using vetiveria zizanioides derived activated carbon as shown in fig 6 it can be observed that on increasing ph of the solution dye removal efficiency of methylene blue increases whereas in case of congo red dye removal efficiency decreases with increasing ph of the solution results revealed that maximum adsorption of methylene blue dye exists over ph value of 7 i e in alkaline medium these results attributed to electrostatic attraction between negative charges of the bio adsorbent surface and positive charge of methylene blue cation also literature reports that removal of methylene blue dye onto plan waste biomass was maximum at ph 12 due to low proton densities on the surface of bio adsorbents in alkaline medium babalola et al 2016 tyagi and khandegar 2018 in contrast dye removal efficiency of congo red was low as compared to methylene blue dye in alkaline medium this can be due to the high electrostatic repulsion between vetiveria zizanioides derived activated carbon bio adsorbent and dye that hinders the adsorption of congo red ions on the surface of activated carbon in alkaline medium maximum removal efficiency was found to be 79 65 at ph 1 due to the increase in positive charges at the solution interphase and the surface of activated carbon become more positively charged hence electrostatic attraction of congo red dye anions led to high removal efficiency in acidic medium 3 3 2 effect of contact time effect of contact time ranging from 15 to 90 min on the adsorption of methylene blue and congo red dye was studied at 30 c using vetiveria zizanioides derived activated carbon bio adsorbent shown in fig 7 it was observed that on increasing contact time from 15 min to 60 min removal efficiency of dye also increases from 23 99 to 59 91 in case of methylene blue and 19 78 44 77 for congo red dye this can be due to maximum availability of active sites for the adsorption of dye ions from aqueous solution on the surface of activated carbon bio adsorbent however further increase in contact time to 90 min gradually decreases the removal efficiency of dye to 33 09 for methylene blue and 20 78 for congo red this observation can be attributed due to the fact that at later stages all the active sites of the bio adsorbent was completely occupied due to predominance of repulsive force between molecules present on surface of activated carbon and in the bulk phase hence slower the further adsorption of dyes gomez et al 2007 conrad et al 2015 su et al 2014 3 3 3 effect of adsorbent dose the effect of adsorbent dose activated carbon was investigated over a wide range of adsorbent amount varied from 0 5 g to 3 g for the removal of methylene blue and congo red dye literature reports that adsorbent dose play a significant role in determining adsorption capacity of dye molecules in aqueous solution at a given concentration singh et al 2017 tyagi and khandegar 2018 it can be observed from fig 8 that on increasing adsorbent dose from 0 5 g to 2 g removal efficiency of dye from aqueous solution increases from 21 21 to 59 63 for methylene blue dye and 18 21 44 7 for congo red dye respectively in 60 min significant increase in the removal efficiency can be due to the availability of adsorption sites on the surface of activated carbon however further increase in adsorbent dose to 3 g does not show significant change and decreases the removal efficiency of dyes to 34 22 for methylene blue and 21 24 for congo red dye respectively this may be due to aggregation of adsorption sites that decreases the surface area of activated carbon and limits the availability of adsorption sites on the surface of activated carbon kadirvelu et al 2003 3 3 4 effect of initial concentration of dye equilibrium studies for the removal of dye were conducted at optimum reaction conditions by varying initial concentration of dyes ranging from 2 5 mg l to 35 mg l in aqueous solution batch experiments were conducted at a uniform stirring speed of 500 rpm contact time of 60 min and adsorbent dose of 2 g fig 9 revealed that removal efficiency of methylene blue and congo red decreases with increase in initial concentration of dyes in aqueous solution though total amount of dyes adsorbed per unit mass of bio adsorbent activated carbon increased the removal efficiency of methylene blue decreases from 78 31 to 36 73 for methylene blue and 68 44 28 45 for congo red dye respectively however the uptake of methylene blue dye was increased from 0 08 mg g to 2 36 mg g and 0 54 mg g to 2 96 mg g for congo red dye respectively with an increase in initial concentration of dyes the significant increase in the uptake of both the dyes may be attributed to an increase in concentration gradient with the increase in initial concentration of dye that provided driving force between solid phase and aqueous phase gong et al 2009 tyagi and khandegar 2018 kushwaha et al 2014 3 3 5 effect of temperature fig 10 shows the effect of temperature on the adsorption of methylene blue and congo red dye using bio adsorbent activated carbon ranging from 303 k to 333 k under optimum conditions it was observed that percentage adsorption of dyes increases with increase in solution temperature i e 57 34 88 9 for methylene blue dye and 43 09 76 23 for congo red dye respectively this may be due the fact that increasing rate of adsorption of dye in aqueous solution may increase rate of diffusion of the dye molecules across the external boundary layer and internal pores of the activated carbon kushwaha et al 2014 tyagi and khandegar 2018 3 4 desorption study in order to make the adsorption process more effective and economical desorption and recyclability study was performed using two different desorption agents namely naoh for congo red and hcl for methylene blue as the adsorption of congo red was most favourable at low ph and methylene blue at high ph therefore respective desorption agents were used for the desorption study this study facilitates the adsorption process and reusability of synthesized activated carbon for next cycles desorption process depends on the interaction between strong binding forces i e covalent or ionic and weak binding forces i e van der waal s forces and dipole dipole interaction that were formed between synthesized activated carbon adsorbent and dye molecules adsorbate in a typical procedure 2 g of adsorbent saturated with 10 mg l of methylene blue ph 9 and congo red dye ph 1 were placed in different desorption agents 0 01 m 3 ml and uniformly stirred at a constant speed of 500 rpm for 1 h after the completion of process the resulting adsorbent referred as ac2 was separated and washed thoroughly with distilled water and further reused for recyclability study it was observed that approximately 62 of methylene blue and 59 of congo red dye was desorbed in 1 h using hcl and naoh respectively in addition recycling efficiency of resulting adsorbent ac2 was also determined up to 6 cycles for the removal of methylene blue and congo red as shown in fig 11 results revealed the removal efficiency of synthesized activated carbon slightly decreases after each cycle for run number 0 i e before desorption the removal efficiency of congo red and methylene blue was found to be 79 65 ph 1 and 71 56 ph 9 respectively however after each cycle the removal efficiency decreases gradually and reduced to 30 11 and 27 81 for congo red and methylene blue respectively on sixth cycle after every cycle respective desorption agents were used as a desorption medium to remove adsorbed dye ions from the surface of activated carbon adsorbent this study indicates the effective adsorption and removal of dyes from regenerated activated carbon which implies the economical and sustainable utilization of activated carbon derived from vetiveria zizanioides as an adsorbent for the removal of dyes at large scale 4 conclusion the activated carbon prepared from pyrolysis of vetiveria zizanioides is identified to be an alternative and new route for the effective removal of methylene blue and congo red dye from aqueous solution physiochemical and conformational changes in the synthesized activated carbon confirms the significant interaction between the dyes and bio adsorbent also surface area of synthesized activated carbon by sulphuric acid activation was found to be relatively high i e 540 13 m2 g and total pore volume of 1 97 cm3 g confirming well developed and porous structure both the dyes were found to be ph sensitive as removal efficiency of methylene blue dye was prominent in acidic medium whereas removal of congo red dye was more effective in acidic medium results revealed that solution temperature plays an important role i e with increase in temperature interaction between dyes and bio adsorbent become more prominent in addition recycling efficiency of regenerated activated carbon was also determined after desorption of dyes using two different desorption medium results revealed that adsorption process was found to be significant till six cycles with maximum removal of dyes up to 30 11 and 27 81 using congo red and methylene blue dye respectively this study signifies the utilization of regenerated activated carbon as an adsorbent and can be consider as economical and sustainable at large scale for the removal of dyes also this study provides an alternate to industries for the cost effective and sustainable production of activated carbon from renewable sources at large scale and increases its applications in effluent industries for dye removal declaration

spectroscopy ft ir x ray diffraction xrd and proximate and ultimate analysis the total surface area and pore structural parameters of the synthesized activated carbon sac were determined by surface area analysis using quantachrome surface analyser surface morphology of raw and dye loaded adsorbent was investigated with the aid of field emission scanning electron microscopic analysis using zeiss evo operated at 20 kv accelerated voltage and magnification of 1kx along with edx energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy analysis ftir was conducted to determine physio chemical and conformational changes of functional groups on surface as well as in bulk phase after modification reflectance spectrum was performed for wavenumber ranging from 400 to 4000 cm 1 with a high resolution of 4 cm 1 using thermoscientific nicolet is50 attenuated total reflectance fourier transform spectroscopy atr ftir the crystallinity was measured using x ray diffraction xpert pro pan alytical model the

determine ash carbon moisture and volatile contents using tappi standards elemental analysis was performed using elemental vario el cube analyser to determine total carbon c nitrogen n hydrogen h contents 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of synthesized activated carbon sac 3 1 1 surface morphology the surface morphology of synthesized activated carbon sac before and after dye loading was recorded through fe sem analysis fig 1 b and c demonstrates the significant changes in textural and porous features of adsorbent before and after accumulation of dye molecules on the surface of adsorbent under magnification of 1 kx at a particle size of 100 μm the well developed cavernous porous structure was observed in the micrograph which may assist in adsorbing large amount of dye molecules from synthetic aqueous solution on the surface of adsorbent also morphological changes in synthesized activated carbon were also supported by bet brunauer emmett teller analysis that shows high surface area and is summarized in table 1 results revealed that synthetic activated carbon has maximum surface area of 540 13 m2 g having total pore volume of 1 97 cm3 g with an average pore size of 0 93 nm confirming large and porous structure in addition elemental analysis of synthesized and dye loaded activated carbon was determined using edx energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy analysis the recorded spectra revealed the presence of carbon 42 12 oxygen 30 76 and sulphur 27 12 elements in synthesized activated carbon as shown in fig 1 a whereas fig 1 b shows the presence of carbon 22 12 oxygen 15 76 sulphur 18 12 sodium 21 13 and calcium 22 87 elements in congo red dye loaded activated carbon spectra similarly fig 1 c shows presence of carbon 20 12 oxygen 18 76 sulphur 12 12 sodium 18 13 potassium 8 01 and calcium 22 86 elements in methylene blue dye loaded activated carbon spectra these results revealed that synthesized activated carbon has high content of carbon oxygen and sulphur elements due to chemical activation of vetiveria zizanioides with h2so4 whereas dye loaded activated carbon shows less content of carbon oxygen and sulphur elements due to the adsorption of dye ions on the surface of activated carbon as a results dye loaded adsorbent shows the combined spectra including other elements such as sodium and potassium 3 1 2 ft ir analysis fig 2 shows ft ir spectra of synthesized and dye loaded activated carbon results clearly revealed stretching broadening of peaks as a result of stretching of functional groups after adsorption of congo red fig 2b and methylene blue fig 2c dye on the surface of synthesized activated carbon adsorbent in general methylene blue and congo red dye loaded adsorbent shows significant modification due to the adsorption of dyes on the surface of activated carbon it was observed that peaks around 3601 3347 cm 1 attributes the presence of more intense and broad peaks in both dye loaded adsorbent as compared to synthesized activated carbon that results in stretching vibration of hydroxyl functional groups tan et al 2008a it may be due to the involvement of hydrogen of oh group that forms surface complex with intra molecular hydrogen bonding and thus facilitates adsorption of dye molecules onto the surface of synthesized activated carbon adsorbent the sharp adsorption band at around 2820 cm 1 in both dye loaded adsorbent corresponds to the symmetric c h stretching of alkane group whereas peaks near 2399 cm 1 corresponds to methoxy band that confirms faster dye removal using vetiveria zizaniodes derived activated carbon however in case of synthesized activated carbon less intense and weak peak was observed as compared to dye loaded activated carbon also broad peak at around 1750 cm 1 confirms the strong stretching of cc stretching of alkynes in both the dye loaded adsorbent whereas disappearance of this peak was observed in synthesized activated carbon in addition adsorption of peaks near 1660 1332 cm 1 confirms the vibrational stretching of co in lactones ketones carboxylic acid group and stretching of cc of aromatic ring in both the dye loaded adsorbent whereas less intense peaks were observed in case of synthesized activated carbon adsorbent kumar et al 2019 also stretching of alcohols c o and amine group n h bend was confirmed by sharp peaks present in the range of 1088 1154 cm 1and 810 881 cm 1 respectively mall et al 2005 santhy and selvapathy 2006 singh et al 2017 in dye loaded activated carbon however disappearance of these peaks was observed in synthesized activated carbon these aforementioned peaks in ft ir spectrum of synthesized and dye loaded activated carbon confirms the physico chemical and conformational modification this may be due to the possibility of adsorbate and adsorbent interaction ion exchange and surface complexation that occurs during adsorption of methylene blue and congo red on the surface of synthesized activated carbon 3 1 3 proximate and ultimate analysis table 1 summarizes the percentage composition of moisture content volatile matter ash and carbon content in synthesized activated carbon determined as reported in our previous work tyagi and khandegar 2018 it was observed that synthesized activated carbon contains 9 3 of moisture content 1 8 of ash content 76 6 of volatile matter and 12 3 of carbon content the carbon content is more than 10 in the resulted adsorbent that clearly justifies the acceptability of adsorbent as green bio adsorbent for the removal of dyes from synthetic wastewater also percentage composition of elemental analysis summarized in table 1 shows that synthesized activated carbon sac contain high carbon content i e 45 13 and oxygen content was found to be 40 75 with low contents of hydrogen and nitrogen 3 1 4 xrd analysis xrd analysis was performed to determine the crystalline structure of vetiveria zizanioides derived activated carbon fig 3 shows sharp and narrow diffraction peak near 2θ of 23 that corresponds to 002 carbon diffraction the development of sharp diffraction peak indicates the presence of microcrystalline structure that occurred after acid h2so4 activation during pyrolysis of vetiveria zizanioides namasivayam and kavitha 2002 also peak near 2θ of 23 resembles the same structure as graphite microcrystalline structure that helps in fast adsorption of dyes from synthetic solution 3 2 pyrolysis study pyrolysis of vetiveria zizanioides was performed for the effective production of activated carbon and its wide usage for the removal of dyes from aqueous solution literature reports that pyrolysis process is mainly influenced by two variables pyrolysis temperature and flow rate of sweep gas therefore in the present work initial experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of these process variables for the effective production of activated carbon 3 2 1 effect of pyrolysis temperature fig 4 shows the effect of temperature on the yield of pyrolysis products using vetiveria zizanioides having particle size of 20 mesh and sweep gas n2 flow rate of 100 cm3 min 1 it was observed that on increasing the temperature from 350 c to 550 c liquid yield increases from 31 09 to 67 76 and char yield increases from 28 67 to 60 12 further increase in temperature to 700 c liquid and char yield gradually decreases to 39 99 and 36 21 respectively however with the increase in temperature from 350 c to 700 c gas yield continuously increases from 24 125 to 59 01 results revealed that with the increase in temperature char yield decreases because char material decompose at higher temperature and hence decreases char yield in contrast gradual decrease in liquid yield with increase in temperature attributes to the increase in secondary volatile decomposition of intermediate hydrocarbons beis et al 2002 kader et al 2013 3 2 2 effect of sweep gas n2 flow rate fig 5 shows the variation in the yield of pyrolysis products using different sweep gas n2 flow rate ranging from 50 to 350 cm3 min 1 with particle size of 20 mesh and pyrolysis temperature of 550 c it can be observed that on increasing sweep gas flow rate from 50 cm3 min 1 to 100 cm3 min 1 liquid yield increases from 63 12 to 67 76 and char yield increases from 54 99 to 60 12 respectively however further increase in sweep gas flow rate to 350 cm3 min 1 liquid yield decreases to 42 01 and char yield increases to 75 01 respectively this may be due to the fact that at high sweep gas flow rate low residence time is available for cracking of long chain of biomass matrix i e cellulose hemi cellulose and lignin to lower hydrocarbons hence decrease liquid yield and thus high flow rate of sweep gas leads to high yield of char also significant increase in the gas yield was observed from 43 34 to 69 23 with the increase in sweep gas flow rate from 50 cm3 min 1 to 100 cm3 min 1 respectively due to insufficient condensation of hot vapours zaror et al 1985 ertas and alma 2010 3 3 adsorption study 3 3 1 effect of solution ph solution ph influence the surface properties of the bio adsorbent by modulating degree of ionisation of the functional groups present in the dye and helps in significant removal of dye from wastewater the effect of solution ph ranging from 1 to 12 was investigated on the adsorption of methylene blue and congo red using vetiveria zizanioides derived activated carbon as shown in fig 6 it can be observed that on increasing ph of the solution dye removal efficiency of methylene blue increases whereas in case of congo red dye removal efficiency decreases with increasing ph of the solution results revealed that maximum adsorption of methylene blue dye exists over ph value of 7 i e in alkaline medium these results attributed to electrostatic attraction between negative charges of the bio adsorbent surface and positive charge of methylene blue cation also literature reports that removal of methylene blue dye onto plan waste biomass was maximum at ph 12 due to low proton densities on the surface of bio adsorbents in alkaline medium babalola et al 2016 tyagi and khandegar 2018 in contrast dye removal efficiency of congo red was low as compared to methylene blue dye in alkaline medium this can be due to the high electrostatic repulsion between vetiveria zizanioides derived activated carbon bio adsorbent and dye that hinders the adsorption of congo red ions on the surface of activated carbon in alkaline medium maximum removal efficiency was found to be 79 65 at ph 1 due to the increase in positive charges at the solution interphase and the surface of activated carbon become more positively charged hence electrostatic attraction of congo red dye anions led to high removal efficiency in acidic medium 3 3 2 effect of contact time effect of contact time ranging from 15 to 90 min on the adsorption of methylene blue and congo red dye was studied at 30 c using vetiveria zizanioides derived activated carbon bio adsorbent shown in fig 7 it was observed that on increasing contact time from 15 min to 60 min removal efficiency of dye also increases from 23 99 to 59 91 in case of methylene blue and 19 78 44 77 for congo red dye this can be due to maximum availability of active sites for the adsorption of dye ions from aqueous solution on the surface of activated carbon bio adsorbent however further increase in contact time to 90 min gradually decreases the removal efficiency of dye to 33 09 for methylene blue and 20 78 for congo red this observation can be attributed due to the fact that at later stages all the active sites of the bio adsorbent was completely occupied due to predominance of repulsive force between molecules present on surface of activated carbon and in the bulk phase hence slower the further adsorption of dyes gomez et al 2007 conrad et al 2015 su et al 2014 3 3 3 effect of adsorbent dose the effect of adsorbent dose activated carbon was investigated over a wide range of adsorbent amount varied from 0 5 g to 3 g for the removal of methylene blue and congo red dye literature reports that adsorbent dose play a significant role in determining adsorption capacity of dye molecules in aqueous solution at a given concentration singh et al 2017 tyagi and khandegar 2018 it can be observed from fig 8 that on increasing adsorbent dose from 0 5 g to 2 g removal efficiency of dye from aqueous solution increases from 21 21 to 59 63 for methylene blue dye and 18 21 44 7 for congo red dye respectively in 60 min significant increase in the removal efficiency can be due to the availability of adsorption sites on the surface of activated carbon however further increase in adsorbent dose to 3 g does not show significant change and decreases the removal efficiency of dyes to 34 22 for methylene blue and 21 24 for congo red dye respectively this may be due to aggregation of adsorption sites that decreases the surface area of activated carbon and limits the availability of adsorption sites on the surface of activated carbon kadirvelu et al 2003 3 3 4 effect of initial concentration of dye equilibrium studies for the removal of dye were conducted at optimum reaction conditions by varying initial concentration of dyes ranging from 2 5 mg l to 35 mg l in aqueous solution batch experiments were conducted at a uniform stirring speed of 500 rpm contact time of 60 min and adsorbent dose of 2 g fig 9 revealed that removal efficiency of methylene blue and congo red decreases with increase in initial concentration of dyes in aqueous solution though total amount of dyes adsorbed per unit mass of bio adsorbent activated carbon increased the removal efficiency of methylene blue decreases from 78 31 to 36 73 for methylene blue and 68 44 28 45 for congo red dye respectively however the uptake of methylene blue dye was increased from 0 08 mg g to 2 36 mg g and 0 54 mg g to 2 96 mg g for congo red dye respectively with an increase in initial concentration of dyes the significant increase in the uptake of both the dyes may be attributed to an increase in concentration gradient with the increase in initial concentration of dye that provided driving force between solid phase and aqueous phase gong et al 2009 tyagi and khandegar 2018 kushwaha et al 2014 3 3 5 effect of temperature fig 10 shows the effect of temperature on the adsorption of methylene blue and congo red dye using bio adsorbent activated carbon ranging from 303 k to 333 k under optimum conditions it was observed that percentage adsorption of dyes increases with increase in solution temperature i e 57 34 88 9 for methylene blue dye and 43 09 76 23 for congo red dye respectively this may be due the fact that increasing rate of adsorption of dye in aqueous solution may increase rate of diffusion of the dye molecules across the external boundary layer and internal pores of the activated carbon kushwaha et al 2014 tyagi and khandegar 2018 3 4 desorption study in order to make the adsorption process more effective and economical desorption and recyclability study was performed using two different desorption agents namely naoh for congo red and hcl for methylene blue as the adsorption of congo red was most favourable at low ph and methylene blue at high ph therefore respective desorption agents were used for the desorption study this study facilitates the adsorption process and reusability of synthesized activated carbon for next cycles desorption process depends on the interaction between strong binding forces i e covalent or ionic and weak binding forces i e van der waal s forces and dipole dipole interaction that were formed between synthesized activated carbon adsorbent and dye molecules adsorbate in a typical procedure 2 g of adsorbent saturated with 10 mg l of methylene blue ph 9 and congo red dye ph 1 were placed in different desorption agents 0 01 m 3 ml and uniformly stirred at a constant speed of 500 rpm for 1 h after the completion of process the resulting adsorbent referred as ac2 was separated and washed thoroughly with distilled water and further reused for recyclability study it was observed that approximately 62 of methylene blue and 59 of congo red dye was desorbed in 1 h using hcl and naoh respectively in addition recycling efficiency of resulting adsorbent ac2 was also determined up to 6 cycles for the removal of methylene blue and congo red as shown in fig 11 results revealed the removal efficiency of synthesized activated carbon slightly decreases after each cycle for run number 0 i e before desorption the removal efficiency of congo red and methylene blue was found to be 79 65 ph 1 and 71 56 ph 9 respectively however after each cycle the removal efficiency decreases gradually and reduced to 30 11 and 27 81 for congo red and methylene blue respectively on sixth cycle after every cycle respective desorption agents were used as a desorption medium to remove adsorbed dye ions from the surface of activated carbon adsorbent this study indicates the effective adsorption and removal of dyes from regenerated activated carbon which implies the economical and sustainable utilization of activated carbon derived from vetiveria zizanioides as an adsorbent for the removal of dyes at large scale 4 conclusion the activated carbon prepared from pyrolysis of vetiveria zizanioides is identified to be an alternative and new route for the effective removal of methylene blue and congo red dye from aqueous solution physiochemical and conformational changes in the synthesized activated carbon confirms the significant interaction between the dyes and bio adsorbent also surface area of synthesized activated carbon by sulphuric acid activation was found to be relatively high i e 540 13 m2 g and total pore volume of 1 97 cm3 g confirming well developed and porous structure both the dyes were found to be ph sensitive as removal efficiency of methylene blue dye was prominent in acidic medium whereas removal of congo red dye was more effective in acidic medium results revealed that solution temperature plays an important role i e with increase in temperature interaction between dyes and bio adsorbent become more prominent in addition recycling efficiency of regenerated activated carbon was also determined after desorption of dyes using two different desorption medium results revealed that adsorption process was found to be significant till six cycles with maximum removal of dyes up to 30 11 and 27 81 using congo red and methylene blue dye respectively this study signifies the utilization of regenerated activated carbon as an adsorbent and can be consider as economical and sustainable at large scale for the removal of dyes also this study provides an alternate to industries for the cost effective and sustainable production of activated carbon from renewable sources at large scale and increases its applications in effluent industries for dye removal declaration

12141,the hydrochemistry of the groundwater has been determined for the samples collected from the ramganga aquifer bareilly district the piper diagram reveals that the majority of groundwater samples fall in ca mg2 hco3 2 the groundwater samples are highly contaminated with higher concentration of trace elements that are beyond the permissible limits for drinking purposes it is observed that heavy metal concentration show the variability with landuse categories seasonal change and groundwater depth highest concentration of heavy metals is found in semi urban areas except zn the sources of heavy metals were assessed using temporal spatial fluctuations in heavy metal concentration and elemental alliances heavy metals do not show strong relationships for the most of the landuse categories except in urban areas and particularly in post monsoon season it is also found that the concentration of metal increased during the processes of recharge in most of the cases heavy metal pollution indices were calculated for drinking purposes using the cdx hpi and hei models maximum indices values are found in rural areas and semi urban sample in pre monsoon and post monsoon season respectively however the lowest indices values were observed for deep water samples in urban areas graphical abstract image 1 keywords hydrochemical facies heavy metals in groundwater ramganga aquifer groundwater quality bareilly water pollution 1 introduction groundwater is present in its purest form beneath the surface of the earth but numerous anthropogenic activities are making it undesirable for drinking and other purposes in recent years the middle class population has risen in india and china due to economic development jalali 2009 furi et al 2011 and baye et al 2012 it is resulting in rapid urbanization and industrialization to meet the demands for many household items for fulfilling the needs of such industrial products a lot of waste is produce while improper management of these waste materials is resulting in de generating the quality of environment the bad environmental quality leading to severe health problems in recent years through contaminated water soil and air ali et al 2016 therefore the subject of environmental quality has become a matter of great concern for governments policy makers scientists planners etc amongst the environmental parameters the water quality is most sensitive to contamination due to its confinement in the ground the studies have found a close relationship between high concentration of metal in drinking water and diseases mcneely et al 1979 underwood 1971 usepa 1983 however some studies have also linked the deficiency of metal with abnormal metabolism athar and vohora 1995 mclaughlin et al 1999 noda and kitagawa 1990 compared to major elements the heavy metals present in soil rock water are in limited concentration taylor and mclennan 1985 but heavy metals are required in much lesser quantity to regulate the metabolism of the animal kind therefore the heavy metal concentrations are proven to most eco toxicological significant the higher health risk of heavy metal concentration in groundwater has got a prompt action by environmental agencies and scientists numbers of studies have been conducted in the area ranging from pristine to highly industrialised environment to analyse the mobility of elements in groundwater to protect the population from elemental hazards bourg 1988 förstner 1987 morgan 1987 campbell and tessier 1987 mohammad mehdi heydari et al 2010 khan et al 2005 the mobilization of the heavy metal in groundwater can be mobilising from natural sources or anthropogenic sources heavy metal mobilization in groundwater from natural sources occurs in limited areas under special eh ph conditions heavy metal groundwater pollution from geogenic sources in wide areas is not very common in literature except for arsenic pollution and a few studies in ganga brahmaputra basin sarkar and shekhar 2018 paul 2017 reporter s a special report on india 2008 however mobilizations of heavy metal from anthropogenic sources are widely reported throughout the world in the vicinity of industries purushotham et al 2013 sluggish groundwater movement gives more time in contact with aquifer or ground material it makes the groundwater sensitive to mobilize the heavy metal or any contaminant from waste material lying on or above the ground surface continuous mobilization of heavy metal into groundwater from dumping ground mine waste and industrial waste is considered one of the major sources of heavy metal pollution israel quino lima et al 2019 linsley et al 1992 it is observed that new innovations based products evolve in developed countries under stringent environment and labour laws the mass production of these products mostly commissioned in reagion of cheap labour and with less stringent environmental laws for profitability it is also called as migration of dirty industries in developing world migration of these dirty industries into countries like india korea china is one of the features of recent globalization therefore the areas or regions which were less polluted in twenty thirty years back are started giving the sigh on highly environmental degradation the migration of the dirty industries is not only limited to the global scale but also replicates itself on local scale and hence results in the form of environmental degradation in rural and urban areas of the developing countries in india the industrial hub developed mainly near to the megacities like delhi mumbai ahmadabad kanpur calcutta and madras due to logistics and skilled labour but these cities expanded in size through time hence the and environmental quality has been severely degraded at present in these cities therefore in near past new strict environmental governance shortage of cheap labour and space become limiting factors for further growth of industries in these mega cities at present the delhi and the national capital region of delhi and many urban centres in north india already has major issues with groundwater quality sarkar et al 2016 saha et al 2016 kumar et al 2018

discussed in detail 2 study area the study area is situated in latitude 28001 n and 28054 n and longitude 78058 e and 79047 e it covers approximately 4120 km2 of the area bareilly district occupies a part of the ramganga sub basin of ganga basin is close to the complex watershed of the main himalayas fig 1 in the last few decades the demand for the water has increased manifold due to rapid urbanization expanding industrialization and increase in agricultural activities in the district since the groundwater is the most dynamic natural resource for a dependable urban rural water supply and assured irrigation it has been extensively exploited in the recent past in the entire district the spatial distribution of the industries in the district is presented in figure 2 in most of the district i e aonla tehsil and in baheri tehsil it has been extensively exploited due to non availability of surface water resources it is inferred that the geology of area doesn t support the development of the ponds and lakes hence few water bodies are available with limited availability of surface water in dry seasons therefore the groundwater is mainly utilized for irrigation purposes and the whole groundwater regime in the area has been affected and leading to continuous depletion of groundwater levels cgwb 2007 3 hydrogeology the area is underlain by the alluvial sediments of quaternary age having a thickness of around 1000 m comprising clay silt and various grades of sands depth to water level is less than 5 00mbgl water level during the pre monsoon in the northeast parts of the district whereas it ranges from 3 00 to 5 00 mbgl in the post monsoon season hence these areas are characterized by the shallow water table depth in the south western parts of the study area the depth to water level varies from the 5 00 to 7 00 mbgl in the pre monsoon and same in the post monsoon whereas in the central parts of the district the water table depth is up to 15 mbgl fig 4 the alluvium occurring in the district is of different types the older alluvium khadar and the newer alluvium bangar fig 3 the groundwater depletion map of the study area has been prepared using the long term groundwater depth data from 1996 to 2016 the depletion values were determined through the regression analysis and the slope of the trend line were considered as rate of groundwater depletion state fig 5 4 materials and methodology fifty one representative groundwater samples were collected from the bareilly district covering the whole study area and locations were chosen on the basis of logistic and grid pattern fig 1 sampling was carried out in nov 2017 and june 2018 using standard techniques american public health association apha 1995 the deep and shallow groundwater samples were distinguished as the government established and personal hand pumps it is standard norms that government established hand pumps are drilled up to 150 feet depth from the surface in study area however the personal hand pumps were drilled up to the depth of 50 60 feet below the surface due to technical as well as financial optimization sampling stations are shown in fig 1 the groundwater samples were analyzed for major elements and heavy metal concentrations according to international standard methods groundwater samples were collected in sterile 1 l polyethylene bottles and each sample of 50 ml was treated by adding the 4 ml of hno3 nitric acid prevent possible precipitation of heavy metals micheal 1982 apha et al 1992 the analyses of cu cr mn ni co and cd were performed in the department of geology aligarh muslim university aligarh using atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas perkinelmer analyst 800 in the heavy metal analysis by aas quality control was monitored using 10 sample blanks and 10 sample replicates in each set of sample analyses 5 the contamination index cd in this method the quality of water is evaluated by the calculation of the degree of contamination and computed separately for each sample of water analyzed as a sum of the contamination factors of individual components exceeding the upper permissible value was taken as the maximum admissible concentration hence the cd summarizes the combined effects of several quality parameters considered harmful to household water the contamination index is calculated from equations formula cd i 1 n cfi where c f i c a i c n i 1 c fi indicates contamination factor for the ith component cai indicates analytical value for the ith component cni indicates upper permissible concentration of the ith component n denotes the normative value the resultant cd value identifies areas of varying contamination levels which are grouped into three categories as follows cd 1 low cd 1 3 medium and cd 3 high the upper permissible concentration value c ni was taken as the maximum admissible concentration mac 6 heavy metal pollution index heavy metal pollution index hpi is a rating method that considers the composite influence of individual heavy metals on overall water quality the rating has been given between 0 and 1 and reflects the relative importance of an individual parameter it can be defined as

the groundwater chemistry in parts of ramganga aquifer the detailed observations during the pre monsoon season are as follows ph value range from 6 to 8 8 mg l hardness range from 1 6 to 7 04 ppm hco3 having 13 312 mg l the concentration of so4 2 shows 9 64 79 74 mg l cl is having concentration ranges between 5 68 and 156 2 mg l ca2 concentration is range from 8 to 117 03 mg l whereas mg2

basis of the average concentration of the different major elements it is found that all the elements are within permissible limit but in the post monsoon season fluoride is showing higher

moderately diluted species cl and hco3 2 enriched parameters include hco3 2 mg2 ca concentrations of the main cations and anions were plotted on the piper diagram for the analysis of the geochemical evolution of groundwater piper diagram has been widely used to study the similarities and differences in the composition of waters and to classify them into certain chemical types the typical classification of hydrochemical facies for groundwater has presented in fig 6 the cations and anions are shown by the separate ternary plots these two ternary plots were then projected up onto a diamond the diagram is a matrix transformation of graphs of anions and cations it can be concluded from the figure that the average concentration of the water samples falls in ca2 mg2 cation type and hco3 2 so4 2 anion type facies the plot of chemical data on diamond shaped trilinear diagram reveals that the majority of groundwater samples fall in the fields of 1 and 3 i e ca mg2 hco3 2 suggesting that alkalies exceed in most of the water samples however few groundwater samples fall in no dominant type the water samples were also analyzed to determine the groundwater quality for irrigation

post monsoon season 8 1 heavy metal characteristics the heavy metals concentration of cu zn ni cd mn co in both pre monsoon and post monsoon in groundwater of research area were analyzed the permissible limit of heavy metal concentration for drinking water and the number of samples in pre and post monsoon in groundwater within the permissible limit is presented in table 1 cu values range from 0 001 mg l to 0 183 mg l during the pre monsoon period however during the post monsoon period the value ranges 0 001 0 305 mg l the concentration of cu is well within w h o permissible limit of 1 5 mg l mn value ranges from 0 to 0 011 mg l during the pre monsoon period however the value ranges from 0 0166 to 1 308 mg l during the post monsoon period the zn values range from 0 075 to 0 146 mg l during the pre monsoon and 0 156 2 245 mg l during the post monsoon period ni values range from 0 247 to 0 976 mg l during the pre monsoon period and from 0 294 to 1 246 mg l during the post monsoon period co value range from 0 143 to 0 624 mg l during the pre monsoon period and from 0 011 to 0 261 mg l during the post monsoon period cd values during the pre monsoon period range 0 06 0 299 mg l and the during post monsoon period range from 0 091 to 0 303 mg l see table 5 and 6 the physicochemical analysis of the 51 groundwater samples collected from different locations from the study area during pre monsoon march and post monsoon november shows seasonal variation in their characteristics the abundance order of heavy metals for pre monsoon is zn co ni cr cd mn cu and ni cr mn zn cd cu co in post monsoon the high concentration of zinc and nickel are the result of high degree of dilution as they are highly used in fertilizers for agricultural practices romic and romic 2003 the order of abundance of heavy metal in groundwater changes with change in season a comparison of heavy metal in groundwater with other nearby districts showing the same ranges of concentration as observed in the present study see table 2 in comparison to other districts the present areas are less industrial the less environmental stringent rules and poor governess by pollution authorities along with hydrogeological conditions leading to a high level of groundwater pollution with respect to heavy metal in the area the groundwater depth in 95 of the study area is less than 10mbgl fig 4 these shallow depths of groundwater make it vulnerable to leaching of heavy metal from the surface particularly during the monsoon season the impact of landuse pattern on heavy metal concentrations has been studied by classifying the study area into rural urban and semi urban area it has been observed that high concentrations of heavy metals are found in semi urban areas except zn a high concentration of zn is observed in rural areas the significant concentration of most of heavy metals in semi urban than urban areas is due to landuse planning and poor implementation of pollution laws adomako et al 2008 suyash et al 2008 suyash and pawar 2010 it is always preferred in the planning to locate the pollutant emitting industries outside the city areas in these areas sometimes the proper drainage and lined drainage system are not provided therefore the effluent of semi urban areas directly reaches the groundwater however in urban areas the governance bodies have funds to line the drainage and also stringent rules enforced by the rented agencies polluting industries which lead to less heavy metal concentration in the urban areas the built up areas in cities are altogether 100 paved so no recharge from these areas takes place and groundwater quality is not effected severely by the recharge from the surface to groundwater in urban areas comparative analysis of heavy metal abundance in groundwater has been an attempt for the different categories of samples collected from shallow aquifer deep aquifer rural semi urban and urban sites shallow and deep aquifer samples are showing marked differences in metal abundance the water samples from shallow aquifers are characterized by high percentage of the zn and ni while deep aquifers samples are characteristics by equal abundances of all the heavy metal the distribution pattern of heavy metal in groundwater in different land use suggested the distinction between rural and urban semi urban sites groundwater in rural area is characterized by zn 66 ni 14 co 8 mn 6 cd 4 cu 2 however the groundwater in urban and semi urban areas are showing order of heavy metal abundance as ni 39 co 18 mn 14 zn 14 cd 11 4 and ni 32 mn 20 co 20 zn 12 cd 10 cu 6 the abundance order indicated that irrespective of categories the cd and cu are the least abundant metal in the groundwater seasonal variations in abundance of heavy metal in different categories were analyzed and only heavy metals were chosen showing a significant change in abundance due to monsoonal recharge most of the metals are showing enrichment or no significant change in all categories however zn is showing dilution in shallow and rural aquifer and the co abundance dilutes in urban and semi urban areas 9 spatio temporal change in heavy metal concentration the sources of metal in groundwater can be determined on the basis of the spatial distribution and fluctuation of metal concentration in groundwater numerous studies have been found relating the concentration of the heavy metals like high concentration of zinc nickel manganese cadmium copper cobalt chromium due to the anthropogenic activities and waste from automobiles repair shops electroplating units and sewage runoff motor parts waste domestic waste sirajudeen et al 2012 virha et al 2010 bharti et al 2013 ravichandran and jayaprakash 2011 thomas et al 2011 the spatial distributions of the metals in groundwater are discussed in detail as follows zinc one of the essentials trace metals needed for the growth of living organisms and plants and it is dangerous too if present in high concentration in the study area northern region is showing the enriched zinc as use of znso4 as micronutrient for the cultivation of the crops especially rice wheat etc high concentration of zinc is also observed high in concentration due to the no adsorption of the zn as it is less electronegative than the other elements in present study fig 8 nickel nickel concentration was observed higher in shallow aquifers than in the deeper aquifers this high concentration of nickel can be a result of nickel mobilization from the surface to the shallow aquifers the source of the ni is probably ni polishing industries effluents etc in the bareilly city area the fluctuation of concentration inferred that the dilution has been taken place in the parts of north north east and in the periphery of the study area whereas the enrichment of ni in groundwater due to monsoonal recharge showing most prominent in urban and semi urban areas including the faridpur block south west bareilly and most of the areas around baheri block fig 9 manganese manganese occurs naturally in many surface water and groundwater however human activities are also responsible for much of the manganese contamination in groundwater in some areas the highest dilution is observed in and around the biggest settlement areas in bareilly district in the study area the high concentration has been reported from the north west mirganj areas and from the peri urban circumference of the bareilly city fig 10 it is also observed from a report on magnesium content in groundwater that tea contains a significant amount of manganese borah et al 2009 as in the urban areas it is possible that a lot of sewage infiltrate into the groundwater so along with the sewage mn also gets enters into the aquifer cadmium the spatial distribution of cd in pre and post monsoon season shows a higher concentration in east and north of the district respectively fluctuation maps of the cd concentration in groundwater due to monsoonal recharge indicate that cd mobilizes mostly from urban surfaces areas of north east and south west fig 11 these are semi urban towns and numbers of industries such as battery and other electrical industries sugar mills and fertilizers are situated here copper spatial distribution indicated that a large part of the area is characterized by low values and highest concentration is mainly around the city town in north and south of the district during pre monsoon while high concentrations values are mainly concentrated along the ramganga river in the south of the district during post monsoon the enrichment during post monsoon indicates the mobilization of cu in water along with monsoon recharge from surface mainly from the industrial areas in north and south of the city fig 12 cobalt it is found that the co concentration is much higher than the permissible limits only in the pre monsoon season while all the samples in post monsoon are under permissible limit the spatial distribution indicated that higher concentration in north and eastern part of the study area seasonal fluctuation in co concentration indicating the mobilization of co from surface to sub surface from the west and eastern part of the study area fig 13 chromium the higher values have been observed in the north eastern regions in the pre monsoon period these higher values could be mobilized from the tile brick kiln industries in the area the washing of the ceramic tiles generally uses the chromate acids in washing ponds resulting high cr in groundwater spatial distribution during post monsoon indicated high concentration in the northeast part of the area change in cr concentration in pre and post monsoon is showing the enrichment of cr in groundwater in most of the area fig 14 10 elemental alliances alliances of the heavy metals were evaluated using the correlation matrix for the purposes of determining the common sources and the association of the heavy metals these correlation matrices were determined separately from the groundwater samples of each land use category and depth of the aquifer it is found that most of the water samples did not show strong alliances among heavy metals in most of the landuse categories however the alliances of heavy metals in groundwater were strong in urban areas particularly in the post monsoon season the highest correlation were found between the cd co in pre monsoon and strong relationships among cu mn r2 0 86 cd mn r2 0 93 and cd cu r2 0 87 in post monsoon season in urban area 11 heavy metal indices by using the three recognisable methods cdx hpi and hei the heavy metal indices were evaluated in the study area these pollution indices were estimated for the specific use of the water and hence can be intended for the drinking and other household purposes the highest index value is represented by a rural sample number seventy two at mundia road in all the models particularly in pre monsoon season however during post monsoon season a semi urban sample number seventy eight from dhimri village shows the maximum index values in all cdx hpi and hei models fig 1 the lowest indices were observed for the deepwater sample in urban areas table 3 a comparison between indices and heavy metal concentration shows a strong relation with cd in all samples in pre monsoon and post monsoon season for the groundwater in urban areas the hei show very high correlation with cd concentration in all categories the inter comparison of indices indicated that cdx measures slightly high values compare to hei and hpi table 4 12 conclusions the detailed study for major ions ca mg2 na k hco3 2 so4 cl 2 indicated ca 2 mg2 hco3 2 type of the groundwater a comparison of major ion concentration against standard parameters shows that groundwater is safe for human consumption at many locations except at few locations however the heavy metal concentration in groundwater inferred the excess at many locations and unsuitable for human consumptions groundwater samples from shallow aquifer are characterized by a high percentage of the zn and ni while deep aquifers samples are characteristics by equal abundances of all the heavy metals the high concentration of cd and zn is obtained in the groundwater originating from the industrial hubs pesticides and micronutrients fertilizers applied in agricultural field strong positive correlations have been found between the metals concentrations of cd co in pre monsoon and strong relationships among cu mn cd mn and cd cu in post monsoon season in urban area the heavy metal mobilization in rural and semi urban areas is mostly from the non point sources and resulting in no alliances of metal in the groundwater however the limited infiltrations and mixing of monsoonal recharge in urban areas is showing in strong alliances of cu mn cd mn and cd cu in groundwater during post monsoon the water quality pollution indices values have been proven a very effective means in estimating the inclusive groundwater pollution water samples from semi urban area show the highest indices values in all cdx hpi and hei models however the lowest indices were observed for the deepwater sample in urban areas in semi urban areas there is unlined or unpaved drainage as compared to the urban areas that lead to the high level concentration of the heavy metal percolation into

12141,the hydrochemistry of the groundwater has been determined for the samples collected from the ramganga aquifer bareilly district the piper diagram reveals that the majority of groundwater samples fall in ca mg2 hco3 2 the groundwater samples are highly contaminated with higher concentration of trace elements that are beyond the permissible limits for drinking purposes it is observed that heavy metal concentration show the variability with landuse categories seasonal change and groundwater depth highest concentration of heavy metals is found in semi urban areas except zn the sources of heavy metals were assessed using temporal spatial fluctuations in heavy metal concentration and elemental alliances heavy metals do not show strong relationships for the most of the landuse categories except in urban areas and particularly in post monsoon season it is also found that the concentration of metal increased during the processes of recharge in most of the cases heavy metal pollution indices were calculated for drinking purposes using the cdx hpi and hei models maximum indices values are found in rural areas and semi urban sample in pre monsoon and post monsoon season respectively however the lowest indices values were observed for deep water samples in urban areas graphical abstract image 1 keywords hydrochemical facies heavy metals in groundwater ramganga aquifer groundwater quality bareilly water pollution 1 introduction groundwater is present in its purest form beneath the surface of the earth but numerous anthropogenic activities are making it undesirable for drinking and other purposes in recent years the middle class population has risen in india and china due to economic development jalali 2009 furi et al 2011 and baye et al 2012 it is resulting in rapid urbanization and industrialization to meet the demands for many household items for fulfilling the needs of such industrial products a lot of waste is produce while improper management of these waste materials is resulting in de generating the quality of environment the bad environmental quality leading to severe health problems in recent years through contaminated water soil and air ali et al 2016 therefore the subject of environmental quality has become a matter of great concern for governments policy makers scientists planners etc amongst the environmental parameters the water quality is most sensitive to contamination due to its confinement in the ground the studies have found a close relationship between high concentration of metal in drinking water and diseases mcneely et al 1979 underwood 1971 usepa 1983 however some studies have also linked the deficiency of metal with abnormal metabolism athar and vohora 1995 mclaughlin et al 1999 noda and kitagawa 1990 compared to major elements the heavy metals present in soil rock water are in limited concentration taylor and mclennan 1985 but heavy metals are required in much lesser quantity to regulate the metabolism of the animal kind therefore the heavy metal concentrations are proven to most eco toxicological significant the higher health risk of heavy metal concentration in groundwater has got a prompt action by environmental agencies and scientists numbers of studies have been conducted in the area ranging from pristine to highly industrialised environment to analyse the mobility of elements in groundwater to protect the population from elemental hazards bourg 1988 förstner 1987 morgan 1987 campbell and tessier 1987 mohammad mehdi heydari et al 2010 khan et al 2005 the mobilization of the heavy metal in groundwater can be mobilising from natural sources or anthropogenic sources heavy metal mobilization in groundwater from natural sources occurs in limited areas under special eh ph conditions heavy metal groundwater pollution from geogenic sources in wide areas is not very common in literature except for arsenic pollution and a few studies in ganga brahmaputra basin sarkar and shekhar 2018 paul 2017 reporter s a special report on india 2008 however mobilizations of heavy metal from anthropogenic sources are widely reported throughout the world in the vicinity of industries purushotham et al 2013 sluggish groundwater movement gives more time in contact with aquifer or ground material it makes the groundwater sensitive to mobilize the heavy metal or any contaminant from waste material lying on or above the ground surface continuous mobilization of heavy metal into groundwater from dumping ground mine waste and industrial waste is considered one of the major sources of heavy metal pollution israel quino lima et al 2019 linsley et al 1992 it is observed that new innovations based products evolve in developed countries under stringent environment and labour laws the mass production of these products mostly commissioned in reagion of cheap labour and with less stringent environmental laws for profitability it is also called as migration of dirty industries in developing world migration of these dirty industries into countries like india korea china is one of the features of recent globalization therefore the areas or regions which were less polluted in twenty thirty years back are started giving the sigh on highly environmental degradation the migration of the dirty industries is not only limited to the global scale but also replicates itself on local scale and hence results in the form of environmental degradation in rural and urban areas of the developing countries in india the industrial hub developed mainly near to the megacities like delhi mumbai ahmadabad kanpur calcutta and madras due to logistics and skilled labour but these cities expanded in size through time hence the and environmental quality has been severely degraded at present in these cities therefore in near past new strict environmental governance shortage of cheap labour and space become limiting factors for further growth of industries in these mega cities at present the delhi and the national capital region of delhi and many urban centres in north india already has major issues with groundwater quality sarkar et al 2016 saha et al 2016 kumar et al 2018

mills fertilizers etc source dic bareilly and expanding with the high rate the heavy metal concentrations in groundwater were determined quality assessment spatial temporal and their sources were discussed in detail 2 study area the study area is situated in latitude 28001 n and 28054 n and longitude 78058 e and 79047 e it covers approximately 4120 km2 of the area bareilly district occupies a part of the ramganga sub basin of ganga basin is close to the complex watershed of the main himalayas fig 1 in the last few decades the demand for the water has increased manifold due to rapid urbanization expanding industrialization and increase in agricultural activities in the district since the groundwater is the most dynamic natural resource for a dependable urban rural water supply and assured irrigation it has been extensively exploited in the recent past in the entire district the spatial distribution of the industries in the district is presented in figure 2 in most of the district i e aonla tehsil and in baheri tehsil it has been extensively exploited due to non availability of surface water resources it is inferred that the geology of area doesn t support the development of the ponds and lakes hence few water bodies are available with limited availability of surface water in dry seasons therefore the groundwater is mainly utilized for irrigation purposes and the whole groundwater regime in the area has been affected and leading to continuous depletion of groundwater levels cgwb 2007 3 hydrogeology the area is underlain by the alluvial sediments of quaternary age having a thickness of around 1000 m comprising clay silt and various grades of sands depth to water level is less than 5 00mbgl water level during the pre monsoon in the northeast parts of the district whereas it ranges from 3 00 to 5 00 mbgl in the post monsoon season hence these areas are characterized by the shallow water table depth in the south western parts of the study area the depth to water level varies from the 5 00 to 7 00 mbgl in the pre monsoon and same in the post monsoon whereas in the central parts of the district the water table depth is up to 15 mbgl fig 4 the alluvium occurring in the district is of different types the older alluvium khadar and the newer alluvium bangar fig 3 the groundwater depletion map of the study area has been prepared using the long term groundwater depth data from 1996 to 2016 the depletion values were determined through the regression analysis and the slope of the trend line were considered as rate of groundwater depletion state fig 5 4 materials and methodology fifty one representative groundwater samples were collected from the bareilly district covering the whole study area and locations were chosen on the basis of logistic and grid pattern fig 1 sampling was carried out in nov 2017 and june 2018 using standard techniques american public health association apha 1995 the deep and shallow groundwater samples were distinguished as the government established and personal hand pumps it is standard norms that government established hand pumps are drilled up to 150 feet depth from the surface in study area however the personal hand pumps were drilled up to the depth of 50 60 feet below the surface due to technical as well as financial optimization sampling stations are shown in fig 1 the groundwater samples were analyzed for major elements and heavy metal concentrations according to international standard methods groundwater samples were collected in sterile 1 l polyethylene bottles and each sample of 50 ml was treated by adding the 4 ml of hno3 nitric acid prevent possible precipitation of heavy metals micheal 1982 apha et al 1992 the analyses of cu cr mn ni co and cd were performed in the department of geology aligarh muslim university aligarh using atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas perkinelmer analyst 800 in the heavy metal analysis by aas quality control was monitored using 10 sample blanks and 10 sample replicates in each set of sample analyses 5 the contamination index cd in this method the quality of water is evaluated by the calculation of the degree of contamination and computed separately for each sample of water analyzed as a sum of the contamination factors of individual components exceeding the upper permissible value was taken as the maximum admissible concentration hence the cd summarizes the combined effects of several quality parameters considered harmful to household water the contamination index is calculated from equations formula cd i 1 n cfi where c f i c a i c n i 1 c fi indicates contamination factor for the ith component cai indicates analytical value for the ith component cni indicates upper permissible concentration of the ith component n denotes the normative value the resultant cd value identifies areas of varying contamination levels which are grouped into three categories as follows cd 1 low cd 1 3 medium and cd 3 high the upper permissible concentration value c ni was taken as the maximum admissible concentration mac 6 heavy metal pollution index heavy metal pollution index hpi is a rating method that considers the composite influence of individual heavy metals on overall water quality the rating has been given between 0 and 1 and reflects the relative importance of an individual parameter it can be defined as

co in post monsoon the high concentration of zinc and nickel are the result of high degree of dilution as they are highly used in fertilizers for agricultural practices romic and romic 2003 the order of abundance of heavy metal in groundwater changes with change in season a comparison of heavy metal in groundwater with other nearby districts showing the same ranges of concentration as observed in the present study see table 2 in comparison to other districts the present areas are less industrial the less environmental stringent rules and poor governess by pollution authorities along with hydrogeological conditions leading to a high level of groundwater pollution with respect to heavy metal in the area the groundwater depth in 95 of the study area is less than 10mbgl fig 4 these shallow depths of groundwater make it vulnerable to leaching of heavy metal from the surface particularly during the monsoon season the impact of landuse pattern on heavy metal concentrations has been studied by classifying the study area into rural urban and semi urban area it has been observed that high concentrations of heavy metals are found in semi urban areas except zn a high concentration of zn is observed in rural areas the significant concentration of most of heavy metals in semi urban than urban areas is due to landuse planning and poor implementation of pollution laws adomako et al 2008 suyash et al 2008 suyash and pawar 2010 it is always preferred in the planning to locate the pollutant emitting industries outside the city areas in these areas sometimes the proper drainage and lined drainage system are not provided therefore the effluent of semi urban areas directly reaches the groundwater however in urban areas the governance bodies have funds to line the drainage and also stringent rules enforced by the rented agencies polluting industries which lead to less heavy metal concentration in the urban areas the built up areas in cities are altogether 100 paved so no recharge from these areas takes place and groundwater quality is not effected severely by the recharge from the surface to groundwater in urban areas comparative analysis of heavy metal abundance in groundwater has been an attempt for the different categories of samples collected from shallow aquifer deep aquifer rural semi urban and urban sites shallow and deep aquifer samples are showing marked differences in metal abundance the water samples from shallow aquifers are characterized by high percentage of the zn and ni while deep aquifers samples are characteristics by equal abundances of all the heavy metal the distribution pattern of heavy metal in groundwater in different land use suggested the distinction between rural and urban semi urban sites groundwater in rural area is characterized by zn 66 ni 14 co 8 mn 6 cd 4 cu 2 however the groundwater in urban and semi urban areas are showing order of heavy metal abundance as ni 39 co 18 mn 14 zn 14 cd 11 4 and ni 32 mn 20 co 20 zn 12 cd 10 cu 6 the abundance order indicated that irrespective of categories the cd and cu are the least abundant metal in the groundwater seasonal variations in abundance of heavy metal in different categories were analyzed and only heavy metals were chosen showing a significant change in abundance due to monsoonal recharge most of the metals are showing enrichment or no significant change in all categories however zn is showing dilution in shallow and rural aquifer and the co abundance dilutes in urban and semi urban areas 9 spatio temporal change in heavy metal concentration the sources of metal in groundwater can be determined on the basis of the spatial distribution and fluctuation of metal concentration in groundwater numerous studies have been found relating the concentration of the heavy metals like high concentration of zinc nickel manganese cadmium copper cobalt chromium due to the anthropogenic activities and waste from automobiles repair shops electroplating units and sewage runoff motor parts waste domestic waste sirajudeen et al 2012 virha et al 2010 bharti et al 2013 ravichandran and jayaprakash 2011 thomas et al 2011 the spatial distributions of the metals in groundwater are discussed in detail as follows zinc one of the essentials trace metals needed for the growth of living organisms and plants and it is dangerous too if present in high concentration in the study area northern region is showing the enriched zinc as use of znso4 as micronutrient for the cultivation of the crops especially rice wheat etc high concentration of zinc is also observed high in concentration due to the no adsorption of the zn as it is less electronegative than the other elements in present study fig 8 nickel nickel concentration was observed higher in shallow aquifers than in the deeper aquifers this high concentration of nickel can be a result of nickel mobilization from the surface to the shallow aquifers the source of the ni is probably ni polishing industries effluents etc in the bareilly city area the fluctuation of concentration inferred that the dilution has been taken place in the parts of north north east and in the periphery of the study area whereas the enrichment of ni in groundwater due to monsoonal recharge showing most prominent in urban and semi urban areas including the faridpur block south west bareilly and most of the areas around baheri block fig 9 manganese manganese occurs naturally in many surface water and groundwater however human activities are also responsible for much of the manganese contamination in groundwater in some areas the highest dilution is observed in and around the biggest settlement areas in bareilly district in the study area the high concentration has been reported from the north west mirganj areas and from the peri urban circumference of the bareilly city fig 10 it is also observed from a report on magnesium content in groundwater that tea contains a significant amount of manganese borah et al 2009 as in the urban areas it is possible that a lot of sewage infiltrate into the groundwater so along with the sewage mn also gets enters into the aquifer cadmium the spatial distribution of cd in pre and post monsoon season shows a higher concentration in east and north of the district respectively fluctuation maps of the cd concentration in groundwater due to monsoonal recharge indicate that cd mobilizes mostly from urban surfaces areas of north east and south west fig 11 these are semi urban towns and numbers of industries such as battery and other electrical industries sugar mills and fertilizers are situated here copper spatial distribution indicated that a large part of the area is characterized by low values and highest concentration is mainly around the city town in north and south of the district during pre monsoon while high concentrations values are mainly concentrated along the ramganga river in the south of the district during post monsoon the enrichment during post monsoon indicates the mobilization of cu in water along with monsoon recharge from surface mainly from the industrial areas in north and south of the city fig 12 cobalt it is found that the co concentration is much higher than the permissible limits only in the pre monsoon season while all the samples in post monsoon are under permissible limit the spatial distribution indicated that higher concentration in north and eastern part of the study area seasonal fluctuation in co concentration indicating the mobilization of co from surface to sub surface from the west and eastern part of the study area fig 13 chromium the higher values have been observed in the north eastern regions in the pre monsoon period these higher values could be mobilized from the tile brick kiln industries in the area the washing of the ceramic tiles generally uses the chromate acids in washing ponds resulting high cr in groundwater spatial distribution during post monsoon indicated high concentration in the northeast part of the area change in cr concentration in pre and post monsoon is showing the enrichment of cr in groundwater in most of the area fig 14 10 elemental alliances alliances of the heavy metals were evaluated using the correlation matrix for the purposes of determining the common sources and the association of the heavy metals these correlation matrices were determined separately from the groundwater samples of each land use category and depth of the aquifer it is found that most of the water samples did not show strong alliances among heavy metals in most of the landuse categories however the alliances of heavy metals in groundwater were strong in urban areas particularly in the post monsoon season the highest correlation were found between the cd co in pre monsoon and strong relationships among cu mn r2 0 86 cd mn r2 0 93 and cd cu r2 0 87 in post monsoon season in urban area 11 heavy metal indices by using the three recognisable methods cdx hpi and hei the heavy metal indices were evaluated in the study area these pollution indices were estimated for the specific use of the water and hence can be intended for the drinking and other household purposes the highest index value is represented by a rural sample number seventy two at mundia road in all the models particularly in pre monsoon season however during post monsoon season a semi urban sample number seventy eight from dhimri village shows the maximum index values in all cdx hpi and hei models fig 1 the lowest indices were observed for the deepwater sample in urban areas table 3 a comparison between indices and heavy metal concentration shows a strong relation with cd in all samples in pre monsoon and post monsoon season for the groundwater in urban areas the hei show very high correlation with cd concentration in all categories the inter comparison of indices indicated that cdx measures slightly high values compare to hei and hpi table 4 12 conclusions the detailed study for major ions ca mg2 na k hco3 2 so4 cl 2 indicated ca 2 mg2 hco3 2 type of the groundwater a comparison of major ion concentration against standard parameters shows that groundwater is safe for human consumption at many locations except at few locations however the heavy metal concentration in groundwater inferred the excess at many locations and unsuitable for human consumptions groundwater samples from shallow aquifer are characterized by a high percentage of the zn and ni while deep aquifers samples are characteristics by equal abundances of all the heavy metals the high concentration of cd and zn is obtained in the groundwater originating from the industrial hubs pesticides and micronutrients fertilizers applied in agricultural field strong positive correlations have been found between the metals concentrations of cd co in pre monsoon and strong relationships among cu mn cd mn and cd cu in post monsoon season in urban area the heavy metal mobilization in rural and semi urban areas is mostly from the non point sources and resulting in no alliances of metal in the groundwater however the limited infiltrations and mixing of monsoonal recharge in urban areas is showing in strong alliances of cu mn cd mn and cd cu in groundwater during post monsoon the water quality pollution indices values have been proven a very effective means in estimating the inclusive groundwater pollution water samples from semi urban area show the highest indices values in all cdx hpi and hei models however the lowest indices were observed for the deepwater sample in urban areas in semi urban areas there is unlined or unpaved drainage as compared to the urban areas that lead to the high level concentration of the heavy metal percolation into

12142,assessment of groundwater pollution vulnerability is imperative and undeniable for appropriate and sustainable management of aquifer especially in arid regions like iran this study aim was to evaluate the intrinsic and the specific vulnerability rate of nehbandan aquifer groundwater vis à vis contamination propagation using the three weighting models drastic sintacts and modified fuzzy drastic considering the two drastic and sintacs models only study the intrinsic vulnerability the fuzzy method was modified drastic to determine the specific vulnerability the results showed that the best method to estimate the area s vulnerability was the modified fuzzy drastic model that had a correlation coefficient of 0 79 with nitrate points this amount is 0 38 and 0 5 respectively for drastic and sintacs besides it was observed that only 2 of the area in drastic 6 in sintacs and 4 in modified fuzzy drastic were located in a very high vulnerable situation and the most area was not vulnerable the outputs of applied methods in the case study area exhibited the intrinsic vulnerability of aquifer and even can be used as a preliminary tool in the development and management of water resources in the future graphical abstract image 1 keywords aquifer vulnerability assessment models contamination mapping nitrate 1 introduction today the population growth increasing the number of exploitation wells unsteady use of groundwater for varied consumptions infiltration of agricultural drainages industrial wastes and urban wastewaters in the aquifers and as well establishment of unsuitable land uses around the water resources has led to significant changes in the quality of groundwater knodel et al 2007 groundwater is the most important resource for drinking and agriculture purposes in arid and semi arid zones that have been increasingly threatened via the contaminants nshimiyimana et al 2016 groundwater pollution impacts are long term and irreparable neshat and pradhan 2015 in several cases the groundwater contamination is distinguished after the contamination of potable water wells the entry of groundwater to the lakes rivers and wetlands has led to the contamination of surface water resources which are associated with the occurrence of detrimental environmental consequences manap et al 2013 identification and preparation of zoning map of aquifer vulnerable areas i e the areas wherein the infiltration and distribution possibility of contaminants from ground surface to the groundwater system exists which are suitable management tools for contamination prevention of groundwater resources also targeting development programs towards less vulnerable zones will make it possible to achieve sustainable development goals radmanesh et al 2018 the vulnerability can be defined as percolation possibility and contaminant diffusion from ground surface to the groundwater system in fact the vulnerability is considered as an intrinsic and specific peculiarity of a groundwater system that is dependent on the sensitivity rate of this system to human or natural impacts vrba and zaporozec 1994 actually it is a relative property type lacking dimension and is immeasurable depending on the aquifer characteristics geological and hydrological environment antonakos and lambrakis 2007 several studies have been carried out on vulnerability evaluation of groundwater busico et al 2017 selected the modified sintacs model for vulnerability assessment of groundwater besides pollution risk evaluation in the areas subjected to human activities in this study they used more than 400 observation wells to assess vulnerability land use was selected as a key parameter to estimate the contamination risk of groundwater the results signified that no3 concentration in urban sub regions was higher in comparison to other regions wherein the vulnerability and risk level was higher than the other areas aboulouafa et al 2017 used sintacs and drastic models to assess vulnerability of barshid plain groundwater the results of both models showed low and moderate area s vulnerability the comparison of nitrate distribution map with two final maps of sintacs and drastic revealed that sintacs gave a better result providing two vulnerability categories low and moderate the vulnerable areas are located in the regions wherein water depth is low and is not protected by soils and the lower vulnerable areas are the regions wherein the water is deeper and the soil is clayey wu et al 2018 in a study tried to optimize the natural and human factors and as well carried out rating reform of these parameters based on the environmental conditions of the area in the drastic method in china waters in this research the weight of each parameter using the analytic hierarchy process ahp was enforced for error reduction in evaluation the results of weights and scientific ratings of modified drastic presented a more realistic evaluation of groundwater vulnerability in relation to the contamination the new model validation showed its accuracy and effectiveness more suitable to the basic drastic model for this study area in the semi arid and arid regions like iran whose average annual precipitation is lower than one third of the world s average annual precipitation the groundwater is an important resource for the supply of fresh water the precipitation limitation and absence of runoffs in most of the areas viz nehbandan have caused people especially agriculturists and ranchers to use groundwater for their water needs therefore contamination identification and vulnerability of groundwater in the region for proper management of aquifer and controlling the infiltration and contamination development in the groundwater encounters special importance thus this study aimed was to evaluate the intrinsic and the specific vulnerability rate of nehbandan aquifer groundwater vis à vis contamination propagation using the three weighting models drastic sintacts and modified fuzzy drastic use of data based models remote sensing data and reforming drastic model with the fuzzy decision making method altogether were the cases that were explored in this study 2 experimental methods 2 1 introducing study area nehbandan county is located between 30 31 to 32 20 north latitudes and 58 35 to 60 52 east longitudes its altitude is 1196 m nehbandan county is the most southern county of south khorasan province in iran nehbandan county with an area of 26094 km2 is the biggest county of the province from the area viewpoint wherein it covers 27 3 of the entire south khorasan province nehbandan s dominant weather is arid its population is 18304 and its water consumption rate from groundwater resources is 120 14 mcm this area s annual average precipitation is 126 mm nehbandan s main activities are agriculture and ranchers and industrial development is very limited statistical annals 2016 fig 1 in nehbandan area three mélange complexes are recognized include 1 tamamdeh complex in the northeast 2 bandan complex in the southeast 3 zone adjacent to the east nehbandan fault the mélange components represent older than complete ophiolite series which have been subsequently dismembered by strike slip faulting the oldest sediments stratigraphically overly the mélange zone are maastrichtian the flysch zone is composed of a great thickness of argillaceous siliceous fine clastic and subordinate calcareous sediments associated with submarine diabasic rocks and tuffs barabadi et al 2016 this sequence is intensity folded and slightly metamorphosed in part it passes into the chaotic rock jumble in many places and was known as colored mélange it contains also numerous large and small bodies of serpantinized ultrabasic rocks the flysch and mélange formations have been overlaid with marked unconformity by paleocene eocene limestones and tertiary quaternary volcanic and continental deposits most of the valleys in the area cover of quaternary alluvial fans and gravel plains fig 2 statistical annals 2016 2 2 methodology different methods exist to assess an aquifer vulnerability like drastic aller et al 1987 god foster 1987 epik doerfliger et al 1999 sintacs civita 1993 and galdit chachadi and lobo ferreira 2007 these methods are divided into two basic groups 1 the numerical methods that can predict the propagation of contaminants in a specific area 2 the overlay methods that are based on parameters and weights the first group is more powerful but requires more data that is not cost effective and flexible oppositely the overlay methods to use of geographic information system gis and lower data are more practical and their final results can easily be described in both the output represents the zone s vulnerability map busico et al 2017 also there are two general types of vulnerability assessments the first addresses specific vulnerability which is referenced to a specific contaminant contaminant class or human activity the second addresses intrinsic vulnerability which does not consider the attributes and behavior of specific contaminants and encompasses all pollutant sources nrc national research council 1993 in the present study two intrinsic vulnerability methods including drastic and sintacs and a specific vulnerability method including modified fuzzy drastic were used 2 2 1 drastic model the most famous and worldwide used method for vulnerability assessment is drastic the drastic method is one of the most reliable effective easy to use and widely used approaches in determining the degree of intrinsic groundwater vulnerability barzegar et al 2018 it is a numerical ranking approach and for the first time was developed in 1987 via the united states environmental protection agency usepa and the american water works association awwa for the vulnerability evaluation of the united states groundwater based on hydrological concepts ahirwar and shukla 2018 the hydrological consideration is in fact the collective describer of all the primary geological and hydrological factors that affect and control the flow of groundwater in an input inside and output of a system in a region haghizade et al 2017 one of the main advantages of the drastic model in relation to other models is vulnerability assessment using several information criteria since the belief is on the fact that herein errors impact and lack of certainties in a single parameter is restricted in the final output novin por et al 2017 the original drastic model is derived from seven variables including depth to groundwater d net recharge r aquifer media a soil media s topography t the impact of the vadose zone i and hydraulic conductivity c the drastic index di is a linear combination of these parameters expressed as follows aller et al 1987 1 di d r d w r r r w a r a w s r s w t r t w i r i w c r c w where d r a s t i and c denote the seven parameters r represents the rate and w defines the weight assigned to each parameter in this methodology a rating value from 1 to 10 is assigned to each parameter as suggested by aller et al 1987 with 1 and 10 representing the least effective and most effective values for groundwater vulnerability this rating assignment is a subjective process therefore an expert performing the test may influence the outcomes of the groundwater vulnerability evaluation the assigned weight for each parameter ranges between 1 and 5 as proposed by aller et al 1987 after computation of drastic index the vulnerable areas of an aquifer are determined the highest rating of this index signifies the higher vulnerability of an aquifer 2 2 2 sintacs model the sintacs model was adopted for the vulnerability evaluation of relative groundwater pollution civita 1993 this model is full fledged from drastic model and is adapted to mediterranean conditions al kuisi et al 2006 this method s parameters are similar to the drastic model with a difference that the weight and ranking of parameters in sintacs have higher flexibility oroji and solgi 2016 sintacs belongs to the overlay model group wherein each parameter in addition to the fact that is ranked singly for a decrease or increase of parameters importance has a different weight wherein the analysis process is considered aboulouafa et al 2017 the acronym sintacs originates from the italian words of the seven parameters employed in the method soggiacenza depth of water infiltrazione efficace effective infiltration non saturo vadose zone tipologia della copertura soil cover acquifero aquifer conducibilita idraulica hydraulic conductivity superficie topografica slope of topographic surface the parameters are multiplied by a weight related to a given hydrogeological setting the form of the equation is like drastic formula civita and de maio 2004 2 2 3 modified fuzzy drastic model in fuzzy logic the membership rate of an element in a set is defined with value as an interval one total membership to zero lack of total membership bonham 1991 this set is specified via a membership function as the membership degree is nearer to one the sign has a higher association with the consideration set and the nearness of the membership degree to zero indicates a lower dependency with the set chanapathi et al 2019 the membership degree generally is expressed with a membership function wherein the function shape can be linear non linear continuous or discontinuous chamanehpour et al 2017 to implement fuzzy logic techniques three consecutive steps are needed which are fuzzification fuzzy inference and defuzzification fuzzification process converts classical data or crisp data into fuzzy data or membership functions mfs fuzzy inference process combines membership functions with the control rules to derive the fuzzy output and defuzzification process uses different methods to calculate each associated output and puts them into a lookup table picking up the output from the lookup table is based on the current input during an application akter et al 2019 in this method to each pixel a number between zero to one is pertained which indicates the specific pollution vulnerability rate for modification of drastic model the three parameters viz land use earthquake acceleration and altitude are also added to the prime seven parameters and each layer is weighted with the fuzzy method at an interval of zero to one the modified method calculates the specific vulnerability of the area the functional membership of assessed quantitative parameters was linear the parameters viz depth of groundwater topography distance from the fault and altitude based on formula 3 was in compliance with reduced linear function thus with parameter value increase its fuzzy weight reduces even the parameters viz net recharge and hydraulic conductivity according to formula 4 were in compliance with increased linear function and with parameter value increase its fuzzy weight increases pathak et al 2008 finally the fuzzy layers were matched by the drastic formula 3 r ij 0 x maxj x ij x maxj x minj 1 x ij x maxj x minj x ij x maxj x ij x minj 4 r ij 0 x ij x minj x maxj x minj 1 x ij x minj x minj x ij x maxj x maxj x ij 2 3 data preparation the research conduction stages are presented in fig 3 in the form of a flowchart after acquisition of information from related departments viz regional water meteorological natural resources etc the required layers were prepared with arc gis 10 6 1 software in raster the geographic coordinate system is wgs 1984 and the utm zone is 40n besides the satellite images were used to obtain precipitation and validation of water table data in an environment of open text software and online google earth engine wherein the specification of used satellite data are as described in table 1 the prepared layers for the conduction of this research included 2 3 1 depth of groundwater this parameter signified the vertical distance between the ground surface and the water table the depth to water table along with specification of unsaturated zone influences the movement time of solid or liquid contaminants that are transported along the water and the dilution process time of contaminants in the unsaturated area asefi et al 2014 as the water tables are deeper the pollution occurrence chance is lower ewusi et al 2017 in order to calculate this parameter the annual average of groundwater depth in 10 years was used 2009 2019 the related information was procured from the regional water department of south khorasan and after validation using the grace cri filtered satellite data presented in fig 4 besides the gis software and the kriging interpolation method the considered layer was prepared considering that surface water changes in the last ten years have been decline the thickness number is negative kriging is a linear regression method for estimating point values or spatial averages at any location of a region this method is defined as best linear unbiased predictor blup or best linear unbiased estimator blue which is known in mathematical geodesy as collocation surface can be expressed as the sum of three main components namely the structural component consisting of a constant average or trend the random but spatially correlated component and the spatially uncorrelated residual error term harman et al 2016 2 3 2 net recharge this index controls the available water for contaminant diffusion and dilution in the saturated and unsaturated zones neshat and pradhan 2015 the higher recharge provides a higher speed for transportation of contaminants to groundwater higher recharge signifies higher groundwater vulnerability since the probability of higher transportation of contaminants increases piscopo 2001 precipitation is the main recharge of the study area groundwater for the preparation of the zone s net recharge layer the daily precipitation data of persiann cdr index from noaa satellite was used during the period 2008 2018 fig 5 and using the precipitation level of available synoptic stations in the zone the authenticity of the obtained data was validated and recharge zoning map of an aquifer was prepared persiann cdr provides the precipitation information on the scale of 0 25 0 25 geographical degrees from 1983 this satellite product is the produce of a remote sensing algorithm using the artificial neural network anns are intelligent systems that are successfully used to solve complicated problems in many different applications such as pattern recognition identification classification speech vision and control systems ann structure is based on our understanding of biological nervous system neurons are the basic structural unit of nervous system and receive inputs from other sources combine them in some way perform a generally nonlinear operation on the result and then output the final result celik et al 2016 2 3 3 aquifer media this factor is dependent on the specifications of the materials forming the saturated area such as porosity rate material and size of particles besides sorting degree of the particles wherein the contamination mobility causes the contamination dilution processes such as chemical digestion absorption and delay jaunat et al 2019 fan deposits in nehbandan plain have very low seed soreness and high permeability they also have high compressibility for preparation of aquifer environment layer the log piezometers information and exploitation wells of the zone were procured from the regional water department of south khorasan province and processed 2 3 4 soil media this pertains to high weathered section of unsaturated area ahirwar and shukla 2018 soil media has a very important effect on the recharge that infiltrates to the water table and is effective on the whereabouts of contaminant s movement as the capacity of pollution transportation is higher a longer period is spent on its transportation nadiri et al 2017 due to the high dryness and high erosion the region soil has not evolved and in some areas large grain alluvial soils are also seen this layer was extracted from the spatial planning project of south khorasan province 2 3 5 topography this parameter in fact is the slope of land surface the slope of land surface highly affects movement and infiltration of the contaminants as the slope level is lower the contact time period of a contaminant with ground surface increases and probability its infiltration into the ground also increases resultantly with reduction of ground surface slope the possibility of aquifer vulnerability increases nobre et al 2007 the slope layer was prepared using the digital elevation model of the zone in the gis environment 2 3 6 impact of the vadose zone the vadose zone is higher zone of water table which is unsaturated with water and or is saturated with water non continuously the thickness and hydraulic specifications of geologic formations of unsaturated area is the key factor for determination of aquifer vulnerability and is the main and natural controller of recharge rate and time period of aquifer recharge ahmadi et al 2013 this map was prepared using the geophysical and lithological data of the area wells 2 3 7 hydraulic conductivity the ability of an aquifer to transport water is with consideration of hydraulic gradient rao et al 2018 high hydraulic conductivity signifies a higher vulnerability of an aquifer rahman 2008 to access this information layer the available hydraulic conductivity rate in the logging information about the zone was used eventually the hydraulic conductivity map was prepared by using the kriging interpolation model 2 3 8 land use land use is one of the most important parameters that very well exhibit human impacts kozlowski and sojka 2019 the contaminant infiltration rate of groundwater is dependent on land use type of the area the case study area possessed the following land uses afforest agriculture urban woodland rock bare land range and multiple lands bareland agricultural and urban land uses transmit the most contamination 2 3 9 distance from fault faults influence the continuity of stones and soil mass and possibly it can act as a channel for contamination infiltration khosravi et al 2018 to prepare the region s fault layer nehbandan s geological map was used one of the active faults in the region is the nehbandan fault 2 3 10 altitude the other assessed parameter in this study was zone altitude since the depth of groundwater in the elevated areas was deeper in relation to the flat areas naghibi et al 2018 altitude effects on parameters such as vegetation permeability land use type and runoff flow to prepare an altitudinal layer of the zone the topography map of south khorasan province was used and the digital elevated model of the zone was prepared in the gis software 2 4 weighting and overlaying after raster map preparation of each parameter the considered layers were classified based on the standards available in each model 7 information layers in drastic and sintacs models on the basis of available weights in table 2 and 10 information layers were classified according to fuzzy logic in the range from zero to one later using the model builder tool in gis each layer was multiplied in its standard weight and eventually for final vulnerability map preparation the entire layers were overlaid on one another the final prepared map was a raster map wherein each pixel had a value that showed the area s vulnerability to the contamination 2 5 calculation of vulnerability rate after overlaying of the layers for the comparison of three applied models in this research the entire overlaying maps were normalized based on the standardization formula 5 at a span of 0 to 100 5 z i x i min x max x min x where x is an original value zi is the normalized value standardization is the process of putting different variables on the same scale this process allows you to compare scores between different types of variables also this method than other methods help to calculate the amount of a parameter between 0 to 100 expressing a concept by percentage makes it easier to understand based on the table 3 the final maps of the three models were classified in four classes and compared 2 6 validation in the present study nitrate values of nehbandan wells in 2017 were used as an index contaminant for the validation of the three applied models nitrate selection as a pollution index in the region was due to the fact that in the study area an impressive industry doesn t exist and nitrate is the main contaminant and due to agricultural and animal husbandry activities is produced in the area and enter an aquifer the presence of nitrate in groundwater is one of the most important pre indicators of water quality destructors and is introduced as an index of anthropogenic pollutants based on the correlation coefficient between nitrate and each model an optimal model for aquifer vulnerability assessment was selected the correlation coefficient in fact exhibits a relationship between the two variables wherein as its value gets closer to one the correlation between the two parameters is higher the correlation coefficient were calculated by using spss 25 software for this purpose in spring 20 water samples from wells of the region were collected the samples were transferred to an environment institute laboratory of birjand university samples were read and analyzed by using a spectrophotometer bio spec 1601 at wavelengths 220 and 275 nm 3 results and discussion in this research it was attempted to estimate the intrinsic and specific vulnerability rate of the nehbandan groundwater with three models drastic sintacs and modified fuzzy drastic the validation criterion of applied methods was computation of correlation coefficient between nitrate and the final vulnerability map prepared in each method after the weighting of applied layers according to drastic sintacs and modified fuzzy drastic methods the respective figs 6 8 were prepared for the assessed parameters in each method the results indicated that in the case study area because of the over harvesting of aquifer and rain limitation groundwater depth was generally low in the northern parts of the area due to the gradient groundwater depth is very low which resultantly caused vulnerability reduction of the region s groundwater to contamination the type of vadose zone and aquifer of the area was also mainly composed of sandstone limestone and sand the low topography of the zone increases its contamination potential since it increases the contaminant s retention time the slope is higher in the northern parts of the area than in the southern parts the maximum height is 2530 m in baharan mountain and the minimum height is 1000 m in kaji wetland the area s precipitation was very low and the main precipitation is in the northern parts of nehbandan plain there is no permanent river and an important recharge resource did not exist in the nehbandan aquifer zone which led to the reduction of the vulnerability index the study area mainly lacked deep soil and even the surface soil type was sand and clay that boosted contaminants infiltration as shown in figs 7 and 8 the classification is more accurate in sintacs and modified fuzzy drastic methods in the fuzzy approach considering a range of preconditions reconditions instead of numbers it offers more detailed after overlaying applied layers in usage methods the vulnerability index value was calculated wherein this value was estimated 32 108 in drastic 32 152 in sintacs and 8 19 in modified fuzzy drastic methods respectively for the comparison of three models the final maps were normalized at the span of 0 to 100 finally using table 3 the vulnerability rates were ranked as the following 5 grades very weak weak average high and very high and according to figures 9 11 the nehbandan aquifer vulnerability rate was presented for the three models viz drastic sintacs and modified fuzzy drastic by comparing the results of the three methods maps obtained the modified fuzzy drastic method offers more accurate and realistic results compared to the contamination of ground data than the two sintacs and drastic methods this is an indication for greater performance of the model these differences are due to differences in the structure of the models the weight of the factors affecting in each model and also the consideration of human parameters in both sintacs and drastic models only intrinsic factors are effective and human parameters are neglected the effects of anthropogenic parameters are considered in the modified fuzzy drastic method so the southern part of the region which has average and high vulnerability in the previous two methods is very highly vulnerable in fuzzy method the southern part of the area has agricultural lands and gardens of jujube and barberry implementation improper land use in the south and the use of pesticides and fertilizers in this area increase the specific vulnerability of the area therefore the total specific and intrinsic vulnerability of the region is greater in the southern part also southern parts of the region have a higher potential for contamination due to proximity to the nehbandan wetland and higher groundwater depth these factors have been the reason for the different vulnerability area in the three applied methods the maps created in this method were fuzzy as well and since the fuzzy method is more compatible with nature and the phenomena are fuzzy in nature the final result was more realistic as a result the modified method is more complete than the other two methods which checking of the correlation between nitrate levels in area s groundwater also confirms that the modified method is more complete then to know which parameter the difference in the model structure and weights or the effect of human factors is more effective on the better final result the three parameters of land use earthquake acceleration and altitude were added to other models sintacs and drastic and the models were run again and the outputs of each were obtained fig 12 based on the obtained maps it was found that the influence of human factors in the two models makes them more realistic with respect to ground data this indicates the need for changes in models that only run with environmental parameters intrinsic parameters it also indicates that anthropogenic factors have a major impact on the vulnerability of groundwater especially the land use factor which is linked to many factors and reflects many human parameters was identified as the most important parameter moreover by comparing the modified fuzzy drastic with modified drastic and sintacs in total due to the different model structure different weighting of parameters and fuzzy seeing agents fuzzy model offers better response than the other two models in addition busico et al 2017 showed that a different ranking in the classification of the parameters could create different vulnerability maps as shown in the results figs 7 and 8 more classes in two sintacs and modified fuzzy drastic models have led to a more precise final map figs 10 and 11 of the vulnerability assessment the difference in methods is due to the difference in weightings the fuzzy method due to consideration of a range of probabilities instead of numbers has resolved the limitations of quantitative methods and offers a more precised analysis in this regard the obtained fuzzy map offers a higher and more accurate range value the application of numerical models can describe the hydrological process the interactions of surface and underground waters and provide reliable results kazakis et al 2019 the usage of several models can improve research performance comparing the results of this study with the result of the vulnerability assessment of groundwater resources of sialkot aquifer in pakistan showed that in sialkot aquifer due to the use of a model for assessing the study area there is no possibility of comparison between several methods and selecting of superior method and the probable errors from use of a method should be ignored khan et al 2019 while in this study using the traditional method along with new and modified methods allows comparison of these methods at the same time and reduces the existing errors the sialkot aquifer is similar in hydrology geology and climatic conditions to the nehbandan aquifer so it is compared with the present study among the three applied models in this research the drastic and sintacs models are highly dependent on the hydrologic features of the basin and should be modified to evaluate its more reliable input data in the third method in addition to hydrology anthropogenic parameters are also effective the possibility of exploring wide data with the drastic model converts it into a potential model that can be more accurate because of using fewer input parameters but how to weigh and rank the data can cause errors in the output which the sintacs model reduces these errors due to the greater flexibility that we have in weighting and ranking nazzal et al 2019 therefore as indicated in the results the sintacs model is more in line with the reality which is consistent with the results of aboulouafa et al in 2017 but the sintacs and drastic models consider only the transfer of pollutants from the surface to aquifer through an unsaturated area into groundwater and it does not record contamination caused by direct contact with groundwater in the wells as a result the amount of vulnerability is lower than actual values khosravi et al 2018 and can be improved by modifying the parameters and the weights on the other hand the two models operate on the basis of expert opinion and do not consider the influence parameters such as land use and land fractures however these parameters have been applied in the modified fuzzy drastic method as a result the development of new methods such as fuzzy can improve the shortcomings of traditional methods which machiwal et al 2018 achieve this important in their research due to effective parameters such as land use or more adaptation of these methods to natural systems is one of the advantages of the new methods for assessing vulnerability in aquifers on the other hand uncertainties are an inescapable part of an investigation that relates to human judgment or errors of assessment tools therefore considering the uncertainty in the fuzzy approach the results can be more effectively reflected the gray nature of the groundwater vulnerability assessment and the impacts of hydrological parameters rebolledo et al 2016 as denoted in table 4 only 2 in drastic 6 in sintacs and 4 in modified fuzzy drastic of the area were located in a very high vulnerability zone and most of the area was not vulnerable but even the same small area is enabled to pollute the groundwater therefore to protect the aquifer it is better to restrict an establishment of contaminating users such as agriculture and industry as stated the nitrate concentration was known as the most important human pollutant in the study area groundwater sensitivity analysis using nitrate index showed that the amount of this pollutant is low in the region but due to agricultural development in the region and urbanization it is possible to be contaminated in the long term therefore the use of land use layer can help regional managers identify vulnerable areas of the aquifer and future planning the kazakis and voudouris study in 2015 also considers that the use of land use layer in order to determine the vulnerability of aquifer is necessary poor rangelands and dense forests have the highest and the least impact on the assessment of groundwater vulnerability respectively the results of khosravi et al 2018 also confirmed that low density rangelands have higher potential for contamination due to their higher exposure to human degradation and forests because of high vegetation density have high filtering properties and reduce pollutant emissions in addition the results showed that the depth of the water surface and the effect of unsaturated area have a high sensitivity to groundwater vulnerability maps in the study area when each of these parameters is eliminated from the evaluation process a significant reduction in the vulnerability index is created considering the correlation coefficient calculation between the nitrate layer and final map in the three applied methods in a significant level of 5 it was observed that modified fuzzy drastic model with 0 79 coefficient was the best model for vulnerability rate display of the area s groundwater to contamination since it had a higher conformity with the ground reality similarly even the modified sintacs model with 0 5 coefficient had higher conformity concerning the standard drastic table 5 exhibits the correlation rate of measured nitrate points with the calculated vulnerability rate in the three applied methods in this study during the development process the contamination of groundwater aquifers for its special qualities and characteristics has become a key issue underlying the management and prevention of aquifers subject to the special should be because of this vulnerability an important factor in the policies and decisions of the various states the most economical means of survival is to ensure groundwater protection and the prevention of pollution of groundwater contamination occur in the first place which is required to provide appropriate solutions 4 conclusion in the present study the intrinsic and the specific vulnerability of nehbandan aquifer groundwater to contamination was assessed via three models drastic sintacs and modified fuzzy drastic use of data based models remote sensing data and reforming drastic model with the fuzzy decision making method altogether were explored grace satellite is a great tool for measuring groundwater levels that gives researchers realistic results and the application of numerical models can describe the hydrological process the interactions of surface and underground waters and provide reliable results in both sintacs and drastic models only intrinsic factors are effective and human parameters are neglected therefore modified fuzzy drastic was selected as the best index for the nehbandan aquifer vulnerability assessment which indicates the intrinsic and specific vulnerability of the region altogether the modified fuzzy drastic method offers more accurate and realistic results compared to the contamination of ground data though the percent of the vulnerable in the zone is very low but it is suggested to be managed and protected for prevention of vulnerable land contamination the applied model s output in the study area show aquifer vulnerability and even in the coming future can be used as a preliminary tool in the management of water resources acknowledgment the authors gratefully

12142,assessment of groundwater pollution vulnerability is imperative and undeniable for appropriate and sustainable management of aquifer especially in arid regions like iran this study aim was to evaluate the intrinsic and the specific vulnerability rate of nehbandan aquifer groundwater vis à vis contamination propagation using the three weighting models drastic sintacts and modified fuzzy drastic considering the two drastic and sintacs models only study the intrinsic vulnerability the fuzzy method was modified drastic to determine the specific vulnerability the results showed that the best method to estimate the area s vulnerability was the modified fuzzy drastic model that had a correlation coefficient of 0 79 with nitrate points this amount is 0 38 and 0 5 respectively for drastic and sintacs besides it was observed that only 2 of the area in drastic 6 in sintacs and 4 in modified fuzzy drastic were located in a very high vulnerable situation and the most area was not vulnerable the outputs of applied methods in the case study area exhibited the intrinsic vulnerability of aquifer and even can be used as a preliminary tool in the development and management of water resources in the future graphical abstract image 1 keywords aquifer vulnerability assessment models contamination mapping nitrate 1 introduction today the population growth increasing the number of exploitation wells unsteady use of groundwater for varied consumptions infiltration of agricultural drainages industrial wastes and urban wastewaters in the aquifers and as well establishment of unsuitable land uses around the water resources has led to significant changes in the quality of groundwater knodel et al 2007 groundwater is the most important resource for drinking and agriculture purposes in arid and semi arid zones that have been increasingly threatened via the contaminants nshimiyimana et al 2016 groundwater pollution impacts are long term and irreparable neshat and pradhan 2015 in several cases the groundwater contamination is distinguished after the contamination of potable water wells the entry of groundwater to the lakes rivers and wetlands has led to the contamination of surface water resources which are associated with the occurrence of detrimental environmental consequences manap et al 2013 identification and preparation of zoning map of aquifer vulnerable areas i e the areas wherein the infiltration and distribution possibility of contaminants from ground surface to the groundwater system exists which are suitable management tools for contamination prevention of groundwater resources also targeting development programs towards less vulnerable zones will make it possible to achieve sustainable development goals radmanesh et al 2018 the vulnerability can be defined as percolation possibility and contaminant diffusion from ground surface to the groundwater system in fact the vulnerability is considered as an intrinsic and specific peculiarity of a groundwater system that is dependent on the sensitivity rate of this system to human or natural impacts vrba and zaporozec 1994 actually it is a relative property type lacking dimension and is immeasurable depending on the aquifer characteristics geological and hydrological environment antonakos and lambrakis 2007 several studies have been carried out on vulnerability evaluation of groundwater busico et al 2017 selected the modified sintacs model for vulnerability assessment of groundwater besides pollution risk evaluation in the areas subjected to human activities in this study they used more than 400 observation wells to assess vulnerability land use was selected as a key parameter to estimate the contamination risk of groundwater the results signified that no3 concentration in urban sub regions was higher in comparison to other regions wherein the vulnerability and risk level was higher than the other areas aboulouafa et al 2017 used sintacs and drastic models to assess vulnerability of barshid plain groundwater the results of both models showed low and moderate area s vulnerability the comparison of nitrate distribution map with two final maps of sintacs and drastic revealed that sintacs gave a better result providing two vulnerability categories low and moderate the vulnerable areas are located in the regions wherein water depth is low and is not protected by soils and the lower vulnerable areas are the regions wherein the water is deeper and the soil is clayey wu et al 2018 in a study tried to optimize the natural and human factors and as well carried out rating reform of these parameters based on the environmental conditions of the area in the drastic method in china waters in this research the weight of each parameter using the analytic hierarchy process ahp was enforced for error reduction in evaluation the results of weights and scientific ratings of modified drastic presented a more realistic evaluation of groundwater vulnerability in relation to the contamination the new model validation showed its accuracy and effectiveness more suitable to the basic drastic model for this study area in the semi arid and arid regions like iran whose average annual precipitation is lower than one third of the world s average annual precipitation the groundwater is an important resource for the supply of fresh water the precipitation limitation and absence of runoffs in most of the areas viz nehbandan have caused people especially agriculturists and ranchers to use groundwater for their water needs therefore contamination identification and vulnerability of groundwater in the region for proper management of aquifer and controlling the infiltration and contamination development in the groundwater encounters special importance thus this study aimed was to evaluate the intrinsic and the specific vulnerability rate of nehbandan aquifer groundwater vis à vis contamination propagation using the three weighting models drastic sintacts and modified fuzzy drastic use of data based models remote sensing data and reforming drastic model with the fuzzy decision making method altogether were the cases that were explored in this study 2 experimental methods 2 1 introducing study area nehbandan county is located between 30 31 to 32 20 north latitudes and 58 35 to 60 52 east longitudes its altitude is 1196 m nehbandan county is the most southern county of south khorasan province in iran nehbandan county with an area of 26094 km2 is the biggest county of the province from the area viewpoint wherein it covers 27 3 of the entire south khorasan province nehbandan s dominant weather is arid its population is 18304 and its water consumption rate from groundwater resources is 120 14 mcm this area s annual average precipitation is 126 mm nehbandan s main activities are agriculture and ranchers and industrial development is very limited statistical annals 2016 fig 1 in nehbandan area three mélange complexes are recognized include 1 tamamdeh complex in the northeast 2 bandan complex in the southeast 3 zone adjacent to the east nehbandan fault the mélange components represent older than complete ophiolite series which have been subsequently dismembered by strike slip faulting the oldest sediments stratigraphically overly the mélange zone are maastrichtian the flysch zone is composed of a great thickness of argillaceous siliceous fine clastic and subordinate calcareous sediments associated with submarine diabasic rocks and tuffs barabadi et al 2016 this sequence is intensity folded and slightly metamorphosed in part it passes into the chaotic rock jumble in many places and was known as colored mélange it contains also numerous large and small bodies of serpantinized ultrabasic rocks the flysch and mélange formations have been overlaid with marked unconformity by paleocene eocene limestones and tertiary quaternary volcanic and continental deposits most of the valleys in the area cover of quaternary alluvial fans and gravel plains fig 2 statistical annals 2016 2 2 methodology different methods exist to assess an aquifer vulnerability like drastic aller et al 1987 god foster 1987 epik doerfliger et al 1999 sintacs civita 1993 and galdit chachadi and lobo ferreira 2007 these methods are divided into two basic groups 1 the numerical methods that can predict the propagation of contaminants in a specific area 2 the overlay methods that are based on parameters and weights the first group is more powerful but requires more data that is not cost effective and flexible oppositely the overlay methods to use of geographic information system gis and lower data are more practical and their final results can easily be described in both the output represents the zone s vulnerability map busico et al 2017 also there are two general types of vulnerability assessments the first addresses specific vulnerability which is referenced to a specific contaminant contaminant class or human activity the second addresses intrinsic vulnerability which does not consider the attributes and behavior of specific contaminants and encompasses all pollutant sources nrc national research council 1993 in the present study two intrinsic vulnerability methods including drastic and sintacs and a specific vulnerability method including modified fuzzy drastic were used 2 2 1 drastic model the most famous and worldwide used method for vulnerability assessment is drastic the drastic method is one of the most reliable effective easy to use and widely used approaches in determining the degree of intrinsic groundwater vulnerability barzegar et al 2018 it is a numerical ranking approach and for the first time was developed in 1987 via the united states environmental protection agency usepa and the american water works association awwa for the vulnerability evaluation of the united states groundwater based on hydrological concepts ahirwar and shukla 2018 the hydrological consideration is in fact the collective describer of all the primary geological and hydrological factors that affect and control the flow of groundwater in an input inside and output of a system in a region haghizade et al 2017 one of the main advantages of the drastic model in relation to other models is vulnerability assessment using several information criteria since the belief is on the fact that herein errors impact and lack of certainties in a single parameter is restricted in the final output novin por et al 2017 the original drastic model is derived from seven variables including depth to groundwater d net recharge r aquifer media a soil media s topography t the impact of the vadose zone i and hydraulic conductivity c the drastic index di is a linear combination of these parameters expressed as follows aller et al 1987 1 di d r d w r r r w a r a w s r s w t r t w i r i w c r c w where d r a s t i and c denote the seven parameters r represents the rate and w defines the weight assigned to each parameter in this methodology a rating value from 1 to 10 is assigned to each parameter as suggested by aller et al 1987 with 1 and 10 representing the least effective and most effective values for groundwater vulnerability this rating assignment is a subjective process therefore an expert performing the test may influence the outcomes of the groundwater vulnerability evaluation the assigned weight for each parameter ranges between 1 and 5 as proposed by aller et al 1987 after computation of drastic index the vulnerable areas of an aquifer are determined the highest rating of this index signifies the higher vulnerability of an aquifer 2 2 2 sintacs model the sintacs model was adopted for the vulnerability evaluation of relative groundwater pollution civita 1993 this model is full fledged from drastic model and is adapted to mediterranean conditions al kuisi et al 2006 this method s parameters are similar to the drastic model with a difference that the weight and ranking of parameters in sintacs have higher flexibility oroji and solgi 2016 sintacs belongs to the overlay model group wherein each parameter in addition to the fact that is ranked singly for a decrease or increase of parameters importance has a different weight wherein the analysis process is considered aboulouafa et al 2017 the acronym sintacs originates from the italian words of the seven parameters employed in the method soggiacenza depth of water infiltrazione efficace effective infiltration non saturo vadose zone tipologia della copertura soil cover acquifero aquifer conducibilita idraulica hydraulic conductivity superficie topografica slope of topographic surface the parameters are multiplied by a weight related to a given hydrogeological setting the form of the equation is like drastic formula civita and de maio 2004 2 2 3 modified fuzzy drastic model in fuzzy logic the membership rate of an element in a set is defined with value as an interval one total membership to zero lack of total membership bonham 1991 this set is specified via a membership function as the membership degree is nearer to one the sign has a higher association with the consideration set and the nearness of the membership degree to zero indicates a lower dependency with the set chanapathi et al 2019 the membership degree generally is expressed with a membership function wherein the function shape can be linear non linear continuous or discontinuous chamanehpour et al 2017 to implement fuzzy logic techniques three consecutive steps are needed which are fuzzification fuzzy inference and defuzzification fuzzification process converts classical data or crisp data into fuzzy data or membership functions mfs fuzzy inference process combines membership functions with the control rules to derive the fuzzy output and defuzzification process uses different methods to calculate each associated output and puts them into a lookup table picking up the output from the lookup table is based on the current input during an application akter et al 2019 in this method to each pixel a number between zero to one is pertained which indicates the specific pollution vulnerability rate for modification of drastic model the three parameters viz land use earthquake acceleration and altitude are also added to the prime seven parameters and each layer is weighted with the fuzzy method at an interval of zero to one the modified method calculates the specific vulnerability of the area the functional membership of assessed quantitative parameters was linear the parameters viz depth of groundwater topography distance from the fault and altitude based on formula 3 was in compliance with reduced linear function thus with parameter value increase its fuzzy weight reduces even the parameters viz net recharge and hydraulic conductivity according to formula 4 were in compliance with increased linear function and with parameter value increase its fuzzy weight increases pathak et al 2008 finally the fuzzy layers were matched by the drastic formula 3 r ij 0 x maxj x ij x maxj x minj 1 x ij x maxj x minj x ij x maxj x ij x minj 4 r ij 0 x ij x minj x maxj x minj 1 x ij x minj x minj x ij x maxj x maxj x ij 2 3 data preparation the research conduction stages are presented in fig 3 in the form of a flowchart after acquisition of information from related departments viz regional water meteorological natural resources etc the required layers were prepared with arc gis 10 6 1 software in raster the geographic coordinate system is wgs 1984 and the utm zone is 40n besides the satellite images were used to obtain precipitation and validation of water table data in an environment of open text software and online google earth engine wherein the specification of used satellite data are as described in table 1 the prepared layers for the conduction of this research included 2 3 1 depth of groundwater this parameter signified the vertical distance between the ground surface and the water table the depth to water table along with specification of unsaturated zone influences the movement time of solid or liquid contaminants that are transported along the water and the dilution process time of contaminants in the unsaturated area asefi et al 2014 as the water tables are deeper the pollution occurrence chance is lower ewusi et al 2017 in order to calculate this parameter the annual average of groundwater depth in 10 years was used 2009 2019 the related information was procured from the regional water department of south khorasan and after validation using the grace cri filtered satellite data presented in fig 4 besides the gis software and the kriging interpolation method the considered layer was prepared considering that surface water changes in the last ten years have been decline the thickness number is negative kriging is a linear regression method for estimating point values or spatial averages at any location of a region this method is defined as best linear unbiased predictor blup or best linear unbiased estimator blue which is known in mathematical geodesy as collocation surface can be expressed as the sum of three main components namely the structural component consisting of a constant average or trend the random but spatially correlated component and the spatially uncorrelated residual error term harman et al 2016 2 3 2 net recharge this index controls the available water for contaminant diffusion and dilution in the saturated and unsaturated zones neshat and pradhan 2015 the higher recharge provides a higher speed for transportation of contaminants to groundwater higher recharge signifies higher groundwater vulnerability since the probability of higher transportation of contaminants increases piscopo 2001 precipitation is the main recharge of the study area groundwater for the preparation of the zone s net recharge layer the daily precipitation data of persiann cdr index from noaa satellite was used during the period 2008 2018 fig 5 and using the precipitation level of available synoptic stations in the zone the authenticity of the obtained data was validated and recharge zoning map of an aquifer was prepared persiann cdr provides the precipitation information on the scale of 0 25 0 25 geographical degrees from 1983 this satellite product is the produce of a remote sensing algorithm using the artificial neural network anns are intelligent systems that are successfully used to solve complicated problems in many different applications such as pattern recognition identification classification speech vision and control systems ann structure is based on our understanding of biological nervous system neurons are the basic structural unit of nervous system and receive inputs from other sources combine them in some way perform a generally nonlinear operation on the result and then output the final result celik et al 2016 2 3 3 aquifer media this factor is dependent on the specifications of the materials forming the saturated area such as porosity rate material and size of particles besides sorting degree of the particles wherein the contamination mobility causes the contamination dilution processes such as chemical digestion absorption and delay jaunat et al 2019 fan deposits in nehbandan plain have very low seed soreness and high permeability they also have high compressibility for preparation of aquifer environment layer the log piezometers information and exploitation wells of the zone were procured from the regional water department of south khorasan province and processed 2 3 4 soil media this pertains to high weathered section of unsaturated area ahirwar and shukla 2018 soil media has a very important effect on the recharge that infiltrates to the water table and is effective on the whereabouts of contaminant s movement as the capacity of pollution transportation is higher a longer period is spent on its transportation nadiri et al 2017 due to the high dryness and high erosion the region soil has not evolved and in some areas large grain alluvial soils are also seen this layer was extracted from the spatial planning project of south khorasan province 2 3 5 topography this parameter in fact is the slope of land surface the slope of land surface highly affects movement and infiltration of the contaminants as the slope level is lower the contact time period of a contaminant with ground surface increases and probability its infiltration into the ground also increases resultantly with reduction of ground surface slope the possibility of aquifer vulnerability increases nobre et al 2007 the slope layer was prepared using the digital elevation model of the zone in the gis environment 2 3 6 impact of the vadose zone the vadose zone is higher zone of water table which is unsaturated with water and or is saturated with water non continuously the thickness and hydraulic specifications of geologic formations of unsaturated area is the key factor for determination of aquifer vulnerability and is the main and natural controller of recharge rate and time period of aquifer recharge ahmadi et al 2013 this map was prepared using the geophysical and lithological data of the area wells 2 3 7 hydraulic conductivity the ability of an aquifer to transport water is with consideration of hydraulic gradient rao et al 2018 high hydraulic conductivity signifies a higher vulnerability of an aquifer rahman 2008 to access this information layer the available hydraulic conductivity rate in the logging information about the zone was used eventually the hydraulic conductivity map was prepared by using the kriging interpolation model 2 3 8 land use land use is one of the most important parameters that very well exhibit human impacts kozlowski and sojka 2019 the contaminant infiltration rate of groundwater is dependent on land use type of the area the case study area possessed the following land uses afforest agriculture urban woodland rock bare land range and multiple lands bareland agricultural and urban land uses transmit the most contamination 2 3 9 distance from fault faults influence the continuity of stones and soil mass and possibly it can act as a channel for contamination infiltration khosravi et al 2018 to prepare the region s fault layer nehbandan s geological map was used one of the active faults in the region is the nehbandan fault 2 3 10 altitude the other assessed parameter in this study was zone altitude since the depth of groundwater in the elevated areas was deeper in relation to the flat areas naghibi et al 2018 altitude effects on parameters such as vegetation permeability land use type and runoff flow to prepare an altitudinal layer of the zone the topography map of south khorasan province was used and the digital elevated model of the zone was prepared in the gis software 2 4 weighting and overlaying after raster map preparation of each parameter the considered layers were classified based on the standards available in each model 7 information layers in drastic and sintacs models on the basis of available weights in table 2 and 10 information layers were classified according to fuzzy logic in the range from zero to one later using the model builder tool in gis each layer was multiplied in its standard weight and eventually for final vulnerability map preparation the entire layers were overlaid on one another the final prepared map was a raster map wherein each pixel had a value that showed the area s vulnerability to the contamination 2 5 calculation of vulnerability rate after overlaying of the layers for the comparison of three applied models in this research the entire overlaying maps were normalized based on the standardization formula 5 at a span of 0 to 100 5 z i x i min x max x min x where x is an original value zi is the normalized value standardization is the process of putting different variables on the same scale this process allows you to compare scores between different types of variables also this method than other methods help to calculate the amount of a parameter between 0 to 100 expressing a concept by percentage makes it easier to understand based on the table 3 the final maps of the three models were classified in four classes and compared 2 6 validation in the present study nitrate values of nehbandan wells in 2017 were used as an index contaminant for the validation of the three applied models nitrate selection as a pollution index in the region was due to the fact that in the study area an impressive industry doesn t exist and nitrate is the main contaminant and due to agricultural and animal husbandry activities is produced in the area and enter an aquifer the presence of nitrate in groundwater is one of the most important pre indicators of water quality destructors and is introduced as an index of anthropogenic pollutants based on the correlation coefficient between nitrate and each model an optimal model for aquifer vulnerability assessment was selected the correlation coefficient in fact exhibits a relationship between the two variables wherein as its value gets closer to one the correlation between the two parameters is higher the correlation coefficient were calculated by using spss 25 software for this purpose in spring 20 water samples from wells of the region were collected the samples were transferred to an environment institute laboratory of birjand university samples were read and analyzed by using a spectrophotometer bio spec 1601 at wavelengths 220 and 275 nm 3 results and discussion in this research it was attempted to estimate the intrinsic and specific vulnerability rate of the nehbandan groundwater with three models drastic sintacs and modified fuzzy drastic the validation criterion of applied methods was computation of correlation coefficient between nitrate and the final vulnerability map prepared in each method after the weighting of applied layers according to drastic sintacs and modified fuzzy drastic methods the respective figs 6 8 were prepared for the assessed parameters in each method the results indicated that in the case study area because of the over harvesting of aquifer and rain limitation groundwater depth was generally low in the northern parts of the area due to the gradient groundwater depth is very low which resultantly caused vulnerability reduction of the region s groundwater to contamination the type of vadose zone and aquifer of the area was also mainly composed of sandstone limestone and sand the low topography of the zone increases its contamination potential since it increases the contaminant s retention time the slope is higher in the northern parts of the area than in the southern parts the maximum height is 2530 m in baharan mountain and the minimum height is 1000 m in kaji wetland the area s precipitation was very low and the main precipitation is in the northern parts of nehbandan plain there is no permanent river and an important recharge resource did not exist in the nehbandan aquifer zone which led to the reduction of the vulnerability index the study area mainly lacked deep soil and even the surface soil type was sand and clay that boosted contaminants infiltration as shown in figs 7 and 8 the classification is more accurate in sintacs and modified fuzzy drastic methods in the fuzzy approach considering a range of preconditions reconditions instead of numbers it offers more detailed after overlaying applied layers in usage methods the vulnerability index value was calculated wherein this value was estimated 32 108 in drastic 32 152 in sintacs and 8 19 in modified fuzzy drastic methods respectively for the comparison of three models the final maps were normalized at the span of 0 to 100 finally using table 3 the vulnerability rates were ranked as the following 5 grades very weak weak average high and very high and according to figures 9 11 the nehbandan aquifer vulnerability rate was presented for the three models viz drastic sintacs and modified fuzzy drastic by comparing the results of the three methods maps obtained the modified fuzzy drastic method offers more accurate and realistic results compared to the contamination of ground data than the two sintacs and drastic methods this is an indication for greater performance of the model these differences are due to differences in the structure of the models the weight of the factors affecting in each model and also the consideration of human parameters in both sintacs and drastic models only intrinsic factors are effective and human parameters are neglected the effects of anthropogenic parameters are considered in the modified fuzzy drastic method so the southern part of the region which has average and high vulnerability in the previous two methods is very highly vulnerable in fuzzy method the southern part of the area has agricultural lands and gardens of jujube and barberry implementation improper land use in the south and the use of pesticides and fertilizers in this area increase the specific vulnerability of the area therefore the total specific and intrinsic vulnerability of the region is greater in the southern part also southern parts of the region have a higher potential for contamination due to proximity to the nehbandan wetland and higher groundwater depth these factors have been the reason for the different vulnerability area in the three applied methods the maps created in this method were fuzzy as well and since the fuzzy method is more compatible with nature and the phenomena are fuzzy in nature the final result was more realistic as a result the modified method is more complete than the other two methods which checking of the correlation between nitrate levels in area s groundwater also confirms that the modified method is more complete then to know which parameter the difference in the model structure and weights or the effect of human factors is more effective on the better final result the three parameters of land use earthquake acceleration and altitude were added to other models sintacs and drastic and the models were run again and the outputs of each were obtained fig 12 based on the obtained maps it was found that the influence of human factors in the two models makes them more realistic with respect to ground data this indicates the need for changes in models that only run with environmental parameters intrinsic parameters it also indicates that anthropogenic factors have a major impact on the vulnerability of groundwater especially the land use factor which is linked to many factors and reflects many human parameters was identified as the most important parameter moreover by comparing the modified fuzzy drastic with modified drastic and sintacs in total due to the different model structure different weighting of parameters and fuzzy seeing agents fuzzy model offers better response than the other two models in addition busico et al 2017 showed that a different ranking in the classification of the parameters could create different vulnerability maps as shown in the results figs 7 and 8 more classes in two sintacs and modified fuzzy drastic models have led to a more precise final map figs 10 and 11 of the vulnerability assessment the difference in methods is due to the difference in weightings the fuzzy method due to consideration of a range of probabilities instead of numbers has resolved the limitations of quantitative methods and offers a more precised analysis in this regard the obtained fuzzy map offers a higher and more accurate range value the application of numerical models can describe the hydrological process the interactions of surface and underground waters and provide reliable results kazakis et al 2019 the usage of several models can improve research performance comparing the results of this study with the result of the vulnerability assessment of groundwater resources of sialkot aquifer in pakistan showed that in sialkot aquifer due to the use of a model for assessing the study area there is no possibility of comparison between several methods and selecting of superior method and the probable errors from use of a method should be ignored khan et al 2019 while in this study using the traditional method along with new and modified methods allows comparison of these methods at the same time and reduces the existing errors the sialkot aquifer is similar in hydrology geology and climatic conditions to the nehbandan aquifer so it is compared with the present study among the three applied models in this research the drastic and sintacs models are highly dependent on the hydrologic features of the basin and should be modified to evaluate its more reliable input data in the third method in addition to hydrology anthropogenic parameters are also effective the possibility of exploring wide data with the drastic model converts it into a potential model that can be more accurate because of using fewer input parameters but how to weigh and rank the data can cause errors in the output which the sintacs model reduces these errors due to the greater flexibility that we have in weighting and ranking nazzal et al 2019 therefore as indicated in the results the sintacs model is more in line with the reality which is consistent with the results of aboulouafa et al in 2017 but the sintacs and drastic models consider only the transfer of pollutants from the surface to aquifer through an unsaturated area into groundwater and it does not record contamination caused by direct contact with groundwater in the wells as a result the amount of vulnerability is lower than actual values khosravi et al 2018 and can be improved by modifying the parameters and the weights on the other hand the two models operate on the basis of expert opinion and do not consider the influence parameters such as land use and land fractures however these parameters have been applied in the modified fuzzy drastic method as a result the development of new methods such as fuzzy can improve the shortcomings of traditional methods which machiwal et al 2018 achieve this important in their research due to effective parameters such as land use or more adaptation of these methods to natural systems is one of the advantages of the new methods for assessing vulnerability in aquifers on the other hand uncertainties are an inescapable part of an investigation that relates to human judgment or errors of assessment tools therefore considering the uncertainty in the fuzzy approach the results can be more effectively reflected the gray nature of the groundwater vulnerability assessment and the impacts of hydrological parameters rebolledo et al 2016 as denoted in table 4 only 2 in drastic 6 in sintacs and 4 in modified fuzzy drastic of the area were located in a very high vulnerability zone and most of the area was not vulnerable but even the same small area is enabled to pollute the groundwater therefore to protect the aquifer it is better to restrict an establishment of contaminating users such as agriculture and industry as stated the nitrate concentration was known as the most important human pollutant in the study area groundwater sensitivity analysis using nitrate index showed that the amount of this pollutant is low in the region but due to agricultural development in the region and urbanization it is possible to be contaminated in the long term therefore the use of land use layer can help regional managers identify vulnerable areas of the aquifer and future planning the kazakis and voudouris study in 2015 also considers that the use of land use layer in order to determine the vulnerability of aquifer is necessary poor rangelands and dense forests have the highest and the least impact on the assessment of groundwater vulnerability respectively the results of khosravi et al 2018 also confirmed that low density rangelands have higher potential for contamination due to their higher exposure to human degradation and forests because of high vegetation density have high filtering properties and reduce pollutant emissions in addition the results showed that the depth of the water surface and the effect of unsaturated area have a high sensitivity to groundwater vulnerability maps in the study area when each of these parameters is eliminated from the evaluation process a significant reduction in the vulnerability index is created considering the correlation coefficient calculation between the nitrate layer and final map in the three applied methods in a significant level of 5 it was observed that modified fuzzy drastic model with 0 79 coefficient was the best model for vulnerability rate display of the area s groundwater to contamination since it had a higher conformity with the ground reality similarly even the modified sintacs model with 0 5 coefficient had higher conformity concerning the standard drastic table 5 exhibits the correlation rate of measured nitrate points with the calculated vulnerability rate in the three applied methods in this study during the development process the contamination of groundwater aquifers for its special qualities and characteristics has become a key issue underlying the management and prevention of aquifers subject to the special should be because of this vulnerability an important factor in the policies and decisions of the various states the most economical means of survival is to ensure groundwater protection and the prevention of pollution of groundwater contamination occur in the first place which is required to provide appropriate solutions 4 conclusion in the present study the intrinsic and the specific vulnerability of nehbandan aquifer groundwater to contamination was assessed via three models drastic sintacs and modified fuzzy drastic use of data based models remote sensing data and reforming drastic model with the fuzzy decision making method altogether were explored grace satellite is a great tool for measuring groundwater levels that gives researchers realistic results and the application of numerical models can describe the hydrological process the interactions of surface and underground waters and provide reliable results in both sintacs and drastic models only intrinsic factors are effective and human parameters are neglected therefore modified fuzzy drastic was selected as the best index for the nehbandan aquifer vulnerability assessment which indicates the intrinsic and specific vulnerability of the region altogether the modified fuzzy drastic method offers more accurate and realistic results compared to the contamination of ground data though the percent of the vulnerable in the zone is very low but it is suggested to be managed and protected for prevention of vulnerable land contamination the applied model s output in the study area show aquifer vulnerability and even in the coming future can be used as a preliminary tool in the management of water resources acknowledgment the authors gratefully

data on the available amount of chemical and biological contamination in water is the first pressing requirement for this approach in addition climate change is causing an uneven pattern of rainfall and severe drought conditions and thus need a substantial attention to delineate the preventive ways for its mitigation in the water scarce area as well as areas with high groundwater depletion or area contributing to the recharge most of the indian rivers are polluted and hence the removal of pollutants is an additional task for making a watershed resilient there is a necessity to evaluate urban water for its better definition and develop the water quality information platform wqip for layman understanding the contemporary need for an approach for sustainable water supply must be developed with an understanding of the expected climate change scenario the idea of your experience my learning opportunity was found very relevant in implementing the developed world experience to a

proposed methodology the suggested research method is given for the scholars and authorities associated with water management we have identified the need for rational evaluation of assessment the given components are the primary task which needs to be done while approaching universal applicability of strategy these steps are compiled with a comprehensive discussion among scholars fig 2 a the overall significance of components will contribute to a fairer water related decision component 1 assessment of the current urban water use system in major cities through a questionnaire survey and a review of available scientific and government organization s reports fig 1 further for the estimation of future water demands and supplies it is necessary to keep in mind that the developing countries economy is improving rapidly many climate related studies are suggesting that although the overall rainfall in the country is not going to change enormously though rainfall pattern will significantly change the studies are also suggesting that there is a spatial shifting of rainfall hence the demand for fresh water for drinking irrigation and in other sectors will increase but erratically to meet the increasing population shortly the scenario defined in global circulation model shows that india could experience more warm and wet conditions as an effect of climate change especially if the summer monsoon becomes more intense mclean et al 1998 mitra et al 2002 kumar et al 2002 also with the change in global paradigm it is imperative to predict several scenarios including that of change in lifestyle habitat and social structures as well as aspiration at present there is no proper water budget firstly there is a need for estimation of the water budget the model should support the

from the current water sources considering the average quality changed by anthropogenic activities vulnerability level in the contamination in water resources can be estimated by measuring concentrations of faecal coliform and intestinal enterococci enterococci sp kumar et al 2019a b for example the health risk of diarrhea by faecal coliform can be estimated from the faecal contamination indicators in the current situation and also the change in its state of quality of water will be calculated besides the risk from the potential water sources which will possibly use when a current water source becomes unavailable it can also be estimated increase in the health risk by faecal contamination from the present to the change in the state of water can be evaluated as a

assessment will be needed fig 3 füssel and klein 2006 have performed first and second generation vulnerability assessment and adaptation policy assessment the different generations of assessments are described using an integrated conceptual framework that defines key concepts of the evaluation and their logical relationships first it is to be aimed to present the common understanding of the climate change community in general the knowledge of the diversity of valid approaches to climate change vulnerability assessment both within the climate change community and other scientific communities it will improve the basis for interdisciplinary work component 5 your experience my lesson in the present world where loops of information are getting shorter and swifter by the time learning from the experience of other is of the paramount importance for an example developed nations experience can be easily applied to a developing country with certain modification our experience with rivers like the brahmaputra guwahati india kelani colombo sri lanka and the jinzu toyama japan explicitly proved kumar et al 2019b that optimism can easily be pumped into the planners and public of developing nation if they know how developed nation fought with their adversaries also the developed nations case forecast about the future problems like in the jinzu river the fastest river in japan the major problems are flooding metal contamination and breeding of invasive species rather mixing of untreated industrial and sewage effluents like jinzu river for flood control dredging the sediment from the bottom of dams and creation of new wetland parks near to river will certainly reduce rain volume flow into the river and prevent from flooding overall planners public and practitioners all need to learn from the experience of others component 6 development of water quality information platform wqip and new strategies of sustainable water supply under climate change scenario will be evolved from the project finding through round table brainstorming session among the experts in the different fields wqip will provide an interactive platform for various stakeholders to come together to discuss waters available for general use of society applicability of results will be extensively reviewed and tested in this phase particularly in indian and sri lankan scenario with particular reference to japan for sustainable management of the urban area 3 data collection the primary data may include personal observations questionnaire survey and informal interviews a total of 15 20 of the population residing in a different location of each city can be interviewed information about the issues related to sustainable water source management should be included in the questionnaire survey to evaluate the quality and quantity of drinking water sources along with their specific challenges and expected sense understand problems faced by locality due to the high extraction of groundwater where intensive agriculture is practiced know the treatment processes used by locals before use for drinking purpose assess the range of turbidity chlorine residual and ph levels leaving the plant levels recorded fluctuations in compliance with water quality standards estimate the chemical and microbial contamination levels in raw and treated water at the plant and distribution network through sample collection in the different season other chemical contaminant concerns pesticides industrial waste etc assess the level of awareness about the existence of contamination in drinking water and willingness to pay for the purification of same gather information on the prevalence of water related illnesses community perceptions and concerns alternate or supplementary water sources 3 1 survey tools the tools for data gathering will be a questionnaire survey personal observation and a checklist questionnaires should be designed to elicit responses on the primary water supply sources sanitation facilities the knowledge and behavior of waterborne diseases water supply personal observations using a checklist can be used to collect information regarding drinking water sources treatment before drinking identify hazards to drinking water quality that can be introduced at multiple points from the source to the tap awareness about sacristy of drinking water resources the more accuracy in data is needed for future aspects of sustainable techniques so there should be several additional questioner needs to address in questioner survey table 1 survey questionnaire may consist of four sections section a will include awareness and attitudinal questions on the environment water sources and the effects of domestic wastewater on people s health and livelihood section b can elicit information on the household s supply of water and the current wastewater treatment facilities availed by the house section c may consist of the safe drinking water scenario and sustainable management of water sources finally section d should ask socio economic questions about the respondent and his her household a logical framework is given in below flow chart fig 3 4 the relevance to strategic plan and policy making climate change affects the global precipitation pattern which can lead to several habitat problems hence the need of the hour is to adopt mitigatory approaches which can at least diminish the effect of climate change to a certain extent managing water resources using an integrated approach would be critical to mitigate social economic and environmental impacts ipcc in 2007 said that water and its availability and quality will be the main pressures on and issues for societies and the environment under climate change when we plan for future water supplies the global picture becomes less important than the effect of climate change on safe water availability in a specific region and in different seasons also the mitigation strategies must be considered to increase the demand for safe water these strategic plans are made to achieve sustainability in the water resource management by understanding the governing processes of water storage and supply it will also analyze the watershed scale by developing an integrated efficient operating system as developing countries are in the phase of modernization of infrastructure it requires meeting the demand of employment and essential amenities for people residing in the urban area thus proper research is the need of present time and as an outcome it should be easily incorporated with enhancing the capacity of the life sustenance capacity of many cities in the asia pacific region further the idea of the proposed research will have robust science based strategies and effective linkage with implacable policies as well as a scientific capacity building guidance the outcome of the study will rationalize its implication through an interface of natural and social sciences and it will help to fill the gap between scientists and policymakers it will create opportunities for them to interact effectively and provide sound scientific input for policy making and spread the scientific knowledge to the public civil society and other non scientific communities fig 4 thus such study will relevantly be mainstreamed into planning and implementation processes 5 more power to the adoption of sustainable primitive technology in developing countries new technology can bring several questions on its applicability in such cases the primitive technology will be more reliable and adoptive for the societies in developing country there are several examples where people have adopted the rainwater harvesting system which has secured the water challenges for their future in wide terms it is also helping in achieving the goal of water security this approach to sustainability also derives the condition for shelter security and ecological security the adoption of rainwater harvest by government departments non governmental organizations ngos and in the general public will improve the groundwater levels in the region the installation of this system will make a significant change that it will meet the immediate requirements of freshwater in the area there is a need to install primitive technologies which are sustainable it requires several measures to be done before implementing technology for establishing a system there is various pros and cons which needs consideration there should be few statutory methods as well an example of measurement for the installation of a well to do technology for rainwater harvesting is discussed below i all municipal corporations village panchayats and the directory board of town and country planning should approve a layout of overall plans including building plans transportation plans environmental plans etc the leases of all building plans for new buildings should pass only after confirming the inclusion of the provision of rainwater harvesting structure in the proposed project ii the case of existing buildings will be made with the efforts of local authorities to ensure that rainwater harvesting structures are put up in the buildings at the earliest iii no building or structure with roof shall be permitted construction without adequate provision for rainwater harvesting iv water connection and sewer connection shall not be given to any building which does not have rainwater harvesting structure v a building that does not provide for rainwater harvesting either in urban or rural areas shall not be assessed to property tax vi huts and thatched structures put up by families living below the poverty line shall be exempted from the above provisions in sri lanka the national policy on rain water harvesting in the country was officially implemented in the year 2005 as india is facing water stress in many regions of the country it should make rainwater harvesting mandatory in all these areas under municipal and urban council jurisdiction within a prescribed period it should be specified in the law for specific categories of buildings and development works and shall be actively encouraged in all local government area 6 policy measure for successful implementation in many developing countries such as india and sri lanka there is no clear policy on reclaimed water usage unfortunately this lack of applications of policy mainly remains on the paper and not successfully implemented due to the severe lack of awareness and active participation of all stakeholders in such a diverse where the percentages of economically challenged stakeholders are too high and safe water and food security are becoming a vital issue the government needs to be informed about the practicality of water policies the close observation needs relevant scientific assessment of natural as well as social challenges with comprehensive guidelines incentives and awareness there is a need to generate coordination in the activities of the various agencies involved in water management 7 need of making more integrated scientific framework the research on the management of water resource should be focused on a particular area understanding the governance of water storage and supply quantity and quality in the city should be followed by the development of an integrated and efficient operating system fig 5 the main objectives of such research can be summarized pointwise as follows 1 to assess the present urban water management and people s perception of drinking water on a specified scale 2 to evaluate the health risk from the current water sources considering the average quality change affected by climate change it includes an understanding of the vulnerability of the water supply system from various conventional biological and chemical pollutants with a particular emphasis on intestinal enterococci enterococci sp and heavy metals 3 to understand the water cycle of particular cities by tracing water recharge source and zones through water quality assessment multivariate statistical analyses and hysplit modeling 4 to propose a new water supply system for more adaptive to the future climate change where each water resource will be properly allocated to specific water use by considering the balance between water supply and demand overall fig 6 shows the concept of targeting the target bull s eye approach for the development of water resilience strategies through integrations of coherent relationship between targets and doers quality safety and biodiversity are three pillars that helps water sustainability and thus different stakeholders are jointly responsible for this roadmap local government plays a significant role leading the way in organizing all the stakeholders carrying out policy and increasing the public awareness while researchers provide technical assistance including cost effective engineering strategies and policy suggestion for all steps in the roadmap at the same time the related companies and residents are supposed to take an active part in the measure implementation only when all the stakeholders will work together a resilient water system can be evolved 8 conclusions the presented study has a more unified scientific way for water resilience strategy the given methods of gathering datasets will have an impact on understanding the issues and sources of chemical and biological pollutants issues which are posing a threat to water quality the article stresses the spatial evaluation of river water with trans boundary policy approach for its better quality and quantity management in developing countries the issues are mostly among the governing body there is a need for more understanding of the social aspects of water as well as a scientific measure to protect it from contaminating sources we have given a significant emphasis on the primitive method of water conservation it includes rainwater harvesting system in the houses creating of new ponds lakes for groundwater recharge with this method we expect it to be a major water bank for future use the study emphasized on more integration of approaches and techniques among all sects of stakeholders moreover for sustaining the high population growth in the urban region surface water needs a high level of maintenance the overall integration of result will contribute to the development of sustainable water management and thus will help in solving one out of the two most vital challenges world is facing today i e lack of fresh water and need for sustainable energy production acknowledgements the authors are thankful to asia pacific network apn global change research gcr crrp2016 06my kumar for financial support we

to come together to discuss waters available for general use of society applicability of results will be extensively reviewed and tested in this phase particularly in indian and sri lankan scenario with particular reference to japan for sustainable management of the urban area 3 data collection the primary data may include personal observations questionnaire survey and informal interviews a total of 15 20 of the population residing in a different location of each city can be interviewed information about the issues related to sustainable water source management should be included in the questionnaire survey to evaluate the quality and quantity of drinking water sources along with their specific challenges and expected sense understand problems faced by locality due to the high extraction of groundwater where intensive agriculture is practiced know the treatment processes used by locals before use for drinking purpose assess the range of turbidity chlorine residual and ph levels leaving the plant levels recorded fluctuations in compliance with water quality standards estimate the chemical and microbial contamination levels in raw and treated water at the plant and distribution network through sample collection in the different season other chemical contaminant concerns pesticides industrial waste etc assess the level of awareness about the existence of contamination in drinking water and willingness to pay for the purification of same gather information on the prevalence of water related illnesses community perceptions and concerns alternate or supplementary water sources 3 1 survey tools the tools for data gathering will be a questionnaire survey personal observation and a checklist questionnaires should be designed to elicit responses on the primary water supply sources sanitation facilities the knowledge and behavior of waterborne diseases water supply personal observations using a checklist can be used to collect information regarding drinking water sources treatment before drinking identify hazards to drinking water quality that can be introduced at multiple points from the source to the tap awareness about sacristy of drinking water resources the more accuracy in data is needed for future aspects of sustainable techniques so there should be several additional questioner needs to address in questioner survey table 1 survey questionnaire may consist of four sections section a will include awareness and attitudinal questions on the environment water sources and the effects of domestic wastewater on people s health and livelihood section b can elicit information on the household s supply of water and the current wastewater treatment facilities availed by the house section c may consist of the safe drinking water scenario and sustainable management of water sources finally section d should ask socio economic questions about the respondent and his her household a logical framework is given in below flow chart fig 3 4 the relevance to strategic plan and policy making climate change affects the global precipitation pattern which can lead to several habitat problems hence the need of the hour is to adopt mitigatory approaches which can at least diminish the effect of climate change to a certain extent managing water resources using an integrated approach would be critical to mitigate social economic and environmental impacts ipcc in 2007 said that water and its availability and quality will be the main pressures on and issues for societies and the environment under climate change when we plan for future water supplies the global picture becomes less important than the effect of climate change on safe water availability in a specific region and in different seasons also the mitigation strategies must be considered to increase the demand for safe water these strategic plans are made to achieve sustainability in the water resource management by understanding the governing processes of water storage and supply it will also analyze the watershed scale by developing an integrated efficient operating system as developing countries are in the phase of modernization of infrastructure it requires meeting the demand of employment and essential amenities for people residing in the urban area thus proper research is the need of present time and as an outcome it should be easily incorporated with enhancing the capacity of the life sustenance capacity of many cities in the asia pacific region further the idea of the proposed research will have robust science based strategies and effective linkage with implacable policies as well as a scientific capacity building guidance the outcome of the study will rationalize its implication through an interface of natural and social sciences and it will help to fill the gap between scientists and policymakers it will create opportunities for them to interact effectively and provide sound scientific input for policy making and spread the scientific knowledge to the public civil society and other non scientific communities fig 4 thus such study will relevantly be mainstreamed into planning and implementation processes 5 more power to the adoption of sustainable primitive technology in developing countries new technology can bring several questions on its applicability in such cases the primitive technology will be more reliable and adoptive for the societies in developing country there are several examples where people have adopted the rainwater harvesting system which has secured the water challenges for their future in wide terms it is also helping in achieving the goal of water security this approach to sustainability also derives the condition for shelter security and ecological security the adoption of rainwater harvest by government departments non governmental organizations ngos and in the general public will improve the groundwater levels in the region the installation of this system will make a significant change that it will meet the immediate requirements of freshwater in the area there is a need to install primitive technologies which are sustainable it requires several measures to be done before implementing technology for establishing a system there is various pros and cons which needs consideration there should be few statutory methods as well an example of measurement for the installation of a well to do technology for rainwater harvesting is discussed below i all municipal corporations village panchayats and the directory board of town and country planning should approve a layout of overall plans including building plans transportation plans environmental plans etc the leases of all building plans for new buildings should pass only after confirming the inclusion of the provision of rainwater harvesting structure in the proposed project ii the case of existing buildings will be made with the efforts of local authorities to ensure that rainwater harvesting structures are put up in the buildings at the earliest iii no building or structure with roof shall be permitted construction without adequate provision for rainwater harvesting iv water connection and sewer connection shall not be given to any building which does not have rainwater harvesting structure v a building that does not provide for rainwater harvesting either in urban or rural areas shall not be assessed to property tax vi huts and thatched structures put up by families living below the poverty line shall be exempted from the above provisions in sri lanka the national policy on rain water harvesting in the country was officially implemented in the year 2005 as india is facing water stress in many regions of the country it should make rainwater harvesting mandatory in all these areas under municipal and urban council jurisdiction within a prescribed period it should be specified in the law for specific categories of buildings and development works and shall be actively encouraged in all local government area 6 policy measure for successful implementation in many developing countries such as india and sri lanka there is no clear policy on reclaimed water usage unfortunately this lack of applications of policy mainly remains on the paper and not successfully implemented due to the severe lack of awareness and active participation of all stakeholders in such a diverse where the percentages of economically challenged stakeholders are too high and safe water and food security are becoming a vital issue the government needs to be informed about the practicality of water policies the close observation needs relevant scientific assessment of natural as well as social challenges with comprehensive guidelines incentives and awareness there is a need to generate coordination in the activities of the various agencies involved in water management 7 need of making more integrated scientific framework the research on the management of water resource should be focused on a particular area understanding the governance of water storage and supply quantity and quality in the city should be followed by the development of an integrated and efficient operating system fig 5 the main objectives of such research can be summarized pointwise as follows 1 to assess the present urban water management and people s perception of drinking water on a specified scale 2 to evaluate the health risk from the current water sources considering the average quality change affected by climate change it includes an understanding of the vulnerability of the water supply system from various conventional biological and chemical pollutants with a particular emphasis on intestinal enterococci enterococci sp and heavy metals 3 to understand the water cycle of particular cities by tracing water recharge source and zones through water quality assessment multivariate statistical analyses and hysplit modeling 4 to propose a new water supply system for more adaptive to the future climate change where each water resource will be properly allocated to specific water use by considering the balance between water supply and demand overall fig 6 shows the concept of targeting the target bull s eye approach for the development of water resilience strategies through integrations of coherent relationship between targets and doers quality safety and biodiversity are three pillars that helps water sustainability and thus different stakeholders are jointly responsible for this roadmap local government plays a significant role leading the way in organizing all the stakeholders carrying out policy and increasing the public awareness while researchers provide technical assistance including cost effective engineering strategies and policy suggestion for all steps in the roadmap at the same time the related companies and residents are supposed to take an active part in the measure implementation only when all the stakeholders will work together a resilient water system can be evolved 8 conclusions the presented study has a more unified scientific way for water resilience strategy the given methods of gathering datasets will have an impact on understanding the issues and sources of chemical and biological pollutants issues which are posing a threat to water quality the article stresses the spatial evaluation of river water with trans boundary policy approach for its better quality and quantity management in developing countries the issues are mostly among the governing body there is a need for more understanding of the social aspects of water as well as a scientific measure to protect it from contaminating sources we have given a significant emphasis on the primitive method of water conservation it includes rainwater harvesting system in the houses creating of new ponds lakes for groundwater recharge with this method we expect it to be a major water bank for future use the study emphasized on more integration of approaches and techniques among all sects of stakeholders moreover for sustaining the high population growth in the urban region surface water needs a high level of maintenance the overall integration of result will contribute to the development of sustainable water management and thus will help in solving one out of the two most vital challenges world is facing today i e lack of fresh water and need for sustainable energy production acknowledgements the authors are thankful to asia pacific network apn global change research gcr crrp2016 06my kumar for financial support we

12144,the goal of the present study is to identify the groundwater regime of morappur area at dharmapuri district india the study area covers an area of 410 sqkm the area belongs to a hard rock terrain where the primary porosity is feeble and the secondary porosity offered by fracture joints and shear zones etc contributes to the groundwater regime the availability of surface water resources is sparse and hence the groundwater repositories are intensely utilized in the current study area the availability of groundwater is limited due to scanty rainfall and poor recharge the entire study area underlain by hard crystalline rocks of archaean age charnokite and hornblende epidote gneiss are the main rock types encountered in the area the over exploitation of these resources more than the adequate recharge has resulted to decrease in the groundwater level in this context it is very much important to identify and understand the groundwater regime of this area for the better groundwater monitoring and conservation of this precious resource remote sensing and gis are playing a vital role in the advancement of hydro geological studies the use of conventional methods alone has its own limitations in comprehending the groundwater regime of the area the integrated study using remote sensing field studies together with gis has helped to understand the role of structural lithological and geomorphic units in controlling the groundwater occurrence and movement in the present study area various thematic maps were prepared from the satellite images and they were integrated and incorporated in a gis platform along with collateral information to study the groundwater regime of morappur area the outcome of this study clearly shows the importance of the geospatial studies in identifying the role of satellite imageries and geospatial techniques to understand the groundwater regime of a hard rock terrain graphical abstract image 1 keywords remote sensing gis groundwater regime hard rock terrain india 1 introduction the concept of the groundwater environment and regime is mainly based on the combination of physical factors such as climate topography and geology pael 1993 these factors and their components play a significant role in deciding the characters of the hydrogeological regime of an area the present study area is a hard rock terrain with limited groundwater resource and the recharge is also poor due to the scanty rainfall and poor replenishment the study of the groundwater regime of an area is important for groundwater monitoring and management agriculture is the primary occupation of the residents in this area the irrational and intense use of precious groundwater is a threat to the agriculture occupation and for other indispensable needs in future due to the tremendous growth of human population the natural resources suffer severe pressure to produce sufficient food and raw materials sitender 2015 hence the study of the groundwater regime is significant in this area the conventional methods alone will not be sufficient to carry out the current studies and also it will be time consuming the remote sensing and gis techniques are widely used in hydro geological studies but the geospatial approach will reduce the cost and time of the study many of the previous studies proved the importance and acceptance of the use of geospatial approaches in groundwater studies in hard rock terrain das et al 2007 vijith 2007 singh et al 2013 politi et al 2016 and most of the conventional field methods are typically site specific kishel and gerla 2002 see fig 1 groundwater accounts for about 30 of the earth s freshwater shiklomanov 1993 the over exploitation of groundwater resources will lead to ecological problems such as fall off groundwater levels water exhaustion water pollution deterioration of water quality and sea water intrusion yeh et al 2014 the occurrence and movement of groundwater resource mainly depend on the aquifer characteristics of the region which is directly or indirectly influenced by geology geological structures lithology geomorphology soil texture drainage patterns lineament land use land cover climate extent of fractures depth of weathering topography primary porosity secondary porosity slope rate of precipitation and infiltration rate mukherjee 1996 jaiswal et al 2003 shekhar and pandey 2014 selvam et al 2015 sathish and elango 2016 the groundwater occurrence in the hard rock region is dominantly controlled by secondary porosity such as fault fold joints etc das 2017 the distribution and migration of groundwater in hard rock terrains are variable and are dependent on the character origin and size of secondary porosity either formed by weathering or tectonic activity irrelevant to the availability of secondary porosity and its dimension the groundwater replenishment in the hard rock terrain takes place by rainfall as well geomorphic controls are also a deciding factor of the groundwater occurrence geological structures such as fault fold joints in shear zones have a major bearing on the groundwater aspects of any area elhag and elzien 2013 mohamed 2015 especially in hard rock terrain this is due to lack of primary porosity in these rocks except in the top most weathered horizon most of the parts of south india are characterized by crystalline and metamorphic rocks which are not rich in groundwater pullare 2006 in such instance they are the only secondary porosity which offered by joints fractures and shear zones that contribute to the groundwater regime the remote sensing satellite data can provide information regarding numerous factors which directly and indirectly controlling the occurrence and movement of groundwater in the aquifer engman gurney 1991 meijerink 1996 jha et al 2007 machiwal et al 2010 the gis provides a quick and efficient platform for managing the large database and complex spatial data and non spatial data for the sustainable natural resource management machiwal et al 2010 stafford 1991 the remote sensing data alone cannot be sufficient to provide the information of the groundwater regime of the area however the surface regime topographical hydrological geological landuse landcover which primarily governs the subsurface water conditions can be studied and mapped using remotely sensed image data in the context of such remote sensing for groundwater exploration the various surface features or indicators can be grouped into two categories viz 1 first order or direct indicators and 2 second order or indirect indicators the first order indicators are directly related to the groundwater regime viz recharge zones soil moisture and vegetation the second order indicators are those hydro geological parameters which regionally indicate the groundwater regime for e g rock soil types structures rock fractures landforms drainage characteristics etc anbazhagan et al 2005 therefore remote sensing plays a vital role and an efficient tool for regional and local groundwater exploration elbeih 2015 the geospatial techniques can provide quick and cost effective outputs with different spatial and temporal resolution the conventional methods demand a lot of money and energy but the geospatial studies are quick and cost effective remote sensing studies have been used as a major geospatial tool to map the various thematic maps of the morappur region geographical information system gives a platform for the integration of these thematic maps and other collateral data for this study in a drought prone area such as dharmapuri district tamilnadu state of south india has poor groundwater resources due to the excess use and poor recharge this hard rock terrain is mostly fed by the secondary porosity offered by the faults fractures joints etc in such a scenario it is essential to have a detailed understanding of the structural lithological and geomorphic detailsof the area to have a better picture of the groundwater regime the present study deals with mapping of structural lithological and geomorphic elements of the drought prone hard rock terrain in dharmapuri district 2 study area and data the study area fig 1 lies between the latitude 11 59ʹ32ʺ to 12 15ʹ54ʺ north and longitude 78 10ʹ 53ʺ to 78 24ʹ 42ʺ east covering an area of 410 sqkm in the dharmapuri district of tamil nadu the study area is an undulating terrain with elevations between 344 m in the east 470 m above mean sea level in the west it is a drought prone semi arid region with hottest summer and cool winters the area experiences good rainfall during the southwest monsoon june august and northeast monsoon october december seasons temperature of the area varies from 20 c to 38 c and attains the maximum in the summer seasons the economy of the study area mainly depends on the agricultural activities the main crop types are paddy sugarcane groundnut and vegetables the ponnaiyar river and its tributaries play a major role in the drainage system of the study area the entire study area is underlain by hard crystalline rocks of archaean age comprising of various rock types such as gneiss charnockite etc in the present study various satellite data has been used for the preparation of various thematic maps aster advanced space borne thermal emission and reflection radiometer is an

space administration nasa the survey of india toposheet of 1 50 000 scales and geology map of 1 250 000 scales were also used in the study the secondary data such as water level information and well location details had been collected from cgwb the field investigations have been carried out mapped the dykes and verified the well locations 3 methodology the present study is an updation of a master project which has been carried out in the year 2010 in the current work all the maps and data were updated using the recently available satellite images and collateral data the methodology adopted in this study includes two major components first part includes a remote sensing based studies and the later includes hydrogeological field investigations and collateral secondary data collection the combined study of field investigations along with remote sensing studies will give a better understanding of the groundwater regime of the area the downloaded raw satellite images may contain variety of errors in the geometry and radiometry the geometric correction radiometric correction calibration and noise removal have been carried out on the image image preprocessing should be completed before the post processing as the part of post processing image enhancement techniques like histogram equalization contrast enhancement principal component analysis normalized difference vegetation index spatial filtering etc have been carried out on the satellite images the image enhancement techniques were used to modify the brightness and contrast of the image to remove the blurriness and to filter out the noise enhancement technique intended to improve the visual quality of images the satellite images after preprocessing are subjected to various enhancement methods for better interpretation certain manipulations can be performed on the digital image so as to have better visual presentation or for information extraction from the enhanced images various thematic maps were produced the srtm dem is also used to understand the terrain information in detail the height information from the dem will give a better outline about the topography of the area the various thematic information obtained from the image data using envi software were integrated to the gis platform to verify the accuracy of the generated maps using satellite images and to add additional details in the maps and to collect data on groundwater parameters extensive field works have been carried out in the study area this field work included the following aspects traversing along and across the strike of formation in the study area mapping location and extent of the dykes in the study area observing different strike of the formation examining sample of the rocks and noting down the co ordinates examining noting down the position of the well location groundwater level and other detail in the entire study area observing and noting down various geomorphic land use and land cover in the study area photography of geological features in the study area the role of remote sensing is not only confined to the preparation of thematic maps alone but also to study the detailed synthesis of geological structural geomorphic maps and their integrated study with the other baseline information to understand the groundwater regime of the area the methodology fig 2 adopted in the study has been given in the following flowchart 4 results and discussion the different thematic maps were prepared using the visual interpretation analysis of satellite images along with the hydrogeological field investigations and available ancillary data for the study area the various thematic maps derived from the integrated data set include geology map geomorphology map structural map land use and land cover map drainge and drainage density map water level contour maps and the well location map the geospatial techniques serve as an effective and efficient tool for the better understanding of the groundwater potential zones muralitharan and palanivel 2015 of hard rock terrain 4 1 the various thematic maps and inferences 4 1 1 geology map the entire study area is underlain by hard crystalline rocks of archaean age comprising of various rock types such as gneiss charnockite etc the gneissic type of crystalline formation is found in the north and north eastern part of the district dharmapuri harur gopinathampatti and morappur areas are covered by epidote hornblende gneiss kadathur and kambainallur areas covered by charnockite and gabbro pyroxinite dolerite dyke varying from few feet to few miles in length and cuts across the country rock in this study area see fig 3 geological map fig 3 has prepared with help of published district resource map prepared by gsi on 1 250 000 scale and has been updated using satellite data the contact of the litho units can be accurately marked and extended using the tonal characteristic in satellite imagery with limited ground checking the structures like dyke faults and the extension can also be mapped from imagery because of the advantage of synoptic view however this data is reliable only if it is used in conjunction with ground truth and other information to get the best output for geological information accordingly adequate ground truth verification was also done by carrying out field work this study area consists of mainly charnockite and epidote hornblende gneiss which have been intruded by dykes of varying composition epidote hornblende gneiss is the second dominant rocks in the study area the gneiss which shows light yellowish green colour on the fcc image fig 4 mainly consists of plagioclase and potash feldspar gneisses are the oldest country rock in india see fig 5 4 1 2 geomorphology map the science of geomorphology is the study of topographic forms geomorphic units landforms fig 5 the geomorphic characters of a region have a very strong control on the groundwater regime of the area the study area includes structural denudational and fluvial landforms the major geomorphic units seen in the study area are structural hills bajada moderate and shallow buried pediments valley fills and tanks each geomorphic unit has varying effects on the groundwater regime applications of the principle of geomorphology provide information which will be of value in predicting the geometry of the aquifers on the weathering and erosion many geological formations develop land forms that are distinctive in respect of slope continuity of outcrops the surface topographic features of bedrock can be sometimes extrapolated to reasonable depths to predict the thickness of alluvium or aeolian sands occurring as valley field deposits and by treating slope profile those can be found it is well known that hydrologic processes are influenced by geomorphometric properties like local slope angle and drainage density from the groundwater point of view the integration of geological structural and hydrogeological data with hydrogeomorphological data is very much useful to understand the better information about groundwater regime with fruitful results satellite remote sensing has been found very useful in delineating geomorphic landform because of its synoptic view quick and inexpensive techniques for getting information various enhancement techniques also helped to identify the different landforms 4 1 2 1 residual hills these are isolated low relief and irregular outlines standing out predominantly and appear as isolated hills or continuous chains of hillocks due to differential erosion thus more resistance formation of rocks stands as residue like hills usually marked with structures such as joints and fractures etc these are poor for ground water prospecting due to steep gradient and the rain water is washed off immediately without much infiltration on standard fcc image it shows brownish tone due to exposed outcrops and varied reddish tone in some area due to partial growth of vegetation 4 1 2 2 pediments pediment is gently sloping area with erosional bedrocks situated between hills and plains consisting of a veneer of detritus and broad undulating rock floor these units generally act as run off zones and as well as recharge zone whenever fracture and their intersection are present the groundwater potential in pediments is poor except along with the fractures where limited quantity of ground water can be obtained for the domestic purpose 4 1 2 3 shallow buried pediments flat and smooth buried pediment with moderately thick 0 5 m over burden the groundwater potential in these geomorphic units is poor 4 1 2 4 moderately buried pediments flat and smooth buried pediment with moderately thick 5 20 m over burden the groundwater potential in these geomorphic units is moderate 4 1 2 5 bajada these are alluvial deposits of varying grain size deposited along the foothill zones which forms highly productive shallow aquifers 4 1 2 6 valley fills these are low lying depressions and negative land forms of varying size and shape occurring within the hills associated with stream course these are unconsolidated alluvial and colluvial materials partly or wholly filled in the valleys by streams and rivers the material in this surface consists of mainly weathered products of the surrounding rocks mostly comprised with moderately thick gravels pebbles sand and silt the prospect varies depending on the thickness of the fills valleys controlled by lineaments and fractures have good groundwater prospect and good potentials for agriculture also valley fills act as good groundwater potential zones and water table is shallow and they have very good groundwater prospects as they are being recharged by surrounding hills as well as by the river water deep bore wells are preferable in these zones for intensive agriculture on standard fcc image it exhibits reddish tone due to the presence of vegetation on screen visual interpretation of aster data has been carried out to identify various landforms taking into consideration of various image and terrain elements the landform which are more important in the ground water prospects tables 1 and 2 are classified into various broad categories and their distribution has been delineated from the remotely sensed data using standard image interpretation elements and the characters 4 1 3 structural map the structural map of the study area consists of lineaments shear zone faults and dykes remote sensing gives enormous facility in mapping the geological structures such as fold faults dykes and lineaments the occurrence and movement of ground water in the hard rock are limited to weathered jointed fractured and sheared zones lineaments are defined as a large scale linear feature which expresses itself in terms of topography and an expression of the underlying structural features lineaments or linear fractures are commonly associated with displacements deformations and prides pathways for groundwater movements these are important where secondary permeability and porosity dominate the lineaments intersection areas are considered as good groundwater potential zones a fault is a fracture or zone of fractures between two blocks of rock faults may range in length from a few millimeters to thousands of kilometers the south indian shield comprises of precambrian granite greenstone dharwar craton in the north bordered to the south by a mobile belt the south indian granulite terrain post archaean mafic igneous activity is wide spread in the form of dyke intrusions in the shield the dyke intrusions are quite spectacular in the immediate vicinity around the cuddapah basin the largest palaeoproterozoic sedimentary basin in the indian shield clusters of dyke intrusions are pervasive throughout the dharwar craton up to the west coast and also in the granulite region of the south india beyond which to the south the dyke intrusions are predominant only in the west coast the dykes are quite variable in lengths and thickness and mostly are fresh dolerites grading into gabbro in the interiors where the dykes are thick the role of structural features at the study area is the wnw ese trending fractures that have been filled by fracture and the nne ssw trending fracture system these structural elements have barring on the groundwater regime as follows the dyke filled fracture system acts as the defined barrier of the groundwater flow from northern region this is clearly evident that the lesser number of wells in the area of south of the dyke system compared to large number of wells in the north of the dyke system the nne ssw trending fracture systems are potential sources of groundwater which are evidence by the presence of many wells along with the fracture system fig 6 4 1 4 landuse and land cover map landuse refers to man activities and various uses which are carried out on land it describes how a parcel of land is used as agriculture settlement or industry landcover refers to natural vegetation water bodies rocks soils artificial cover and other resulting due to land transformation the term landuse landcover is closely related and interchangeable per the purpose of which land is being used they are commonly associated with different types of cover such as forest agriculture waste land or water bodies landuse landcover exerts considerable influence on the various hydrological phenomenon s such as interception infiltration evaporation and surface flow applications of satellite remote sensing for land use surveys and mapping is gaining importance because of its ability to provide rapid and reliable data within a given time of framework realizing the relationship between landuse and hydro geomorphology is important for planning and management activities sajith 2005 the landuse landcover map was prepared using satellite image in conjunction with soi top maps on 1 50 000 scales visual interpretation of landsat tm fcc was used to delineate various landuse landcover categories fig 7 landuse landcover categorization is envisaged based on the classification scheme developed by national remote sensing agency the landuse landcover characteristics were delineated based on the image characteristics like tone texture shape association etc during the interpretation wherever doubtful units are encountered the ground trouth survey was under taken to verify the same fig 7 describes the landuse landcover map of the study area the characteristics of landuse landcover classification are depicted in table 3 the landuse landcover classes identified in the study area are built up land cropland fallow land land with scrub land without scrub barren sheet rock stony waste area and tanks 4 1 4 1 built up land it is defined as an area of human habitation developed due to non agricultural use and that which has a cover of buildings transport communication utilities in association with water vegetation and vacant lands land used for human settlement in rural villages is comparatively less size than urban settlement 4 1 4 2 agricultural land it is defined as the land primarily used for farming and for production of food fiber and other commercial and horticultural crops it includes crops fallow lands and plantations 4 1 4 3 croplands it includes those lands with standing crops as on the date of satellite imagery the area under crops have been identified and mapped 4 1 4 4 fallow land it is described as agricultural land which is taken for cultivation but is temporarily allowed to rest uncropped for one more season but less than one year at the time of the imagery taken of both seasons these lands are seen particularly devoid of crops on the fcc fallow land shows yellow to greenish blue tone irregular shape with varying size associated with crop land or harvested agriculture field 4 1 4 5 forest it is an area baring an association predominantly of tree and other vegetation types capable of producing timer and other forest produce satellite data has been used for mapping different forest types and density classes with reliable accuracy through visual as well as digital techniques forest exerts influence on climate and water regime and also provides shelter for wildlife and livestock 4 1 4 6 land with scrub scrublands are seen along with the ridge and valley complex linear ridges and deep slope areas most of these areas are identified by the presence of thorny scrub and herb species many hillocks of steep and dumbbell shaped are associated with poor vegetal cover as a consequence severe soil erosion frequently occurs during rainy seasons resulting most of the hilltops become barren rocky 4 1 4 7 land without scrub land under these classes is generally prone to degradation deterioration it is confined to the higher topography like uplands or high ground etc and excludes hills and mountain terrains on fcc it shows light yellow to brown to greenish blue varying in size associated with gentle relief and moderate slope in plain and surrounded by agriculture lands 4 1 4 8 barren rock stony waste these are the lands characterized by exposed massive rocks sheet rocks stony pavements or land with excessive surface accumulation of stones that render them unsuitable for production of any green biomass such lands are easily discriminated from other categories of wastelands because of their characteristic spectral responds on fcc it shows greenish blue to yellow to brownish in tone with varying size association with steep isolated hillocks hill slopes and eroded plains 4 1 5 drainage and drainage density map the drainage system of the study area belongs to the ponnaiyar river basin and its tributaries from the study it is seen that the drainage is mostly of dentritic and sub dentritic pattern the spatial arrangement of streams giving rise to a particular design is called as drainage pattern the drainage pattern reflects original slope structures like folds faults joints and wrapping in the study area dentritic sub dentritic and trellis type of drainage patterns are observed in dentritic drainage pattern the network of tributaries of various orders and magnitudes joints the master stream and resembles like the branches of a tree the development of dentritic drainage is associated with the areas of homogenous lithology and gently sloping to almost horizontal or flat topographical surface having extremely low relief sub dentritic patterns differ from the dentritic only in the lack of perfection of development of streams dentritic and sub dentritic patterns are governed by regional slope homogenous lithology and relief babar and kaplay 1999 trellis drainage pattern tends to develop where there is strong structural control upon streams exist because of geology in such situations channels align themselves parallel to structures in the bedrock with minor tributaries coming at right angles fig 8 deals with the drainage and drainage density map of the study area 4 1 6 water level contour map the understanding of spatial and seasonal changes in the groundwater level is significant in the understanding of groundwater regime of the study area field investigations have been carried out to measure the groundwater level in the pre and post monsoon seasons the spatial variation of the measured groundwater level below ground surface for 2007 and 2008 has been given by the following fig 9 4 1 7 the well location map the groundwater is the main source of water and the presence of surface water is scanty the agriculture sector depended mainly on the groundwater resource a total of 780 number of wells both tube wells and dug wells are available in the study area from the well location map it is observed that around 450 wells were present at the northern side of the dykes above 220 wells are existing at the southern side of the dykes and about 110 wells are observed between the dykes the well location map has given in the fig 10 4 2 inferences this study aims at mapping of geological geomorphic units structural unit s landuse and landcover and relates them with the groundwater resources of part of morappur region of dharmapuri district south india the study of remote sensing evaluated the groundwater regime of the morappur area and identified the various factors which are influencing the groundwater in this hard rock terrain of dharmapuri district of tamil nadu it is essential to relate the lithology geology of the terrain and the groundwater regime charnockite and hornblende epidote gneiss are the main rock types encountered in this area the dykes traversing the entire study area along wnw ese direction are the other litho units that control the groundwater regime to support the above fact it can be observed that there are above 450 wells north of the dykes above 220 wells south of the dykes and 110 wells between the dykes thus it is observed that there are less than 50 of the number of wells in the area of south of the dykes compared to the area of north of the dykes since there is no sedimentary litho unit in the study area it may be concluded that the structural geomorphic and lithological aspects play a major role in groundwater regime of the area from the table 1 it is evident that the fluvial geomorphic units are the most promising groundwater regions followed by denudational landforms bajada deep pediments peniplain these units are followed by structural landforms structural hills linear ridges the above inference is a result of analyzing the number of wells present in each landforms it should be noted that the absence of wells in the nne part of the study area doesn t indicate poor groundwater condition but only suggests that the agriculture fields and villagers derive the water requirement from the ponnaiyar river and not from the subsurface in general the area can be divided into three units with regard to its groundwater occurrence they are 1 in northern and north eastern flood plain dominated groundwater regime 2 pedimentous low to moderate potential regime 3 the moderate to high potential regime in the valley fills and bajada regions the correlation of groundwater table at various seasons confirming the groundwater table is shallow during the period of post monsoon due to nonuniformity in the number of wells used for the preparation of spatial groundwater map the minor variations also noticed in the spatial variation in the groundwater table among various seasons overall the groundwater flow system is controlled by structural features that are clearly evident by spatial variation of groundwater table irrespective of various season two sets of fractures are present in the study area which are wnw ese trending fracture systems filled by dykes and the nne ssw trending fracture system which induces water permeability however the dykes filled fracture system act as definite barrier of the groundwater flow from northern region this is due to the presence of deeper groundwater table towards south west part of the fracture system occupied by dykes the geometry of dykes represents that the dykes are comparatively younger than the period of shear zone occurrence the comparison of groundwater table across the shear zone also representing the barrier effect of dykes in the groundwater control the wells located towards western part of the shear zone represent deeper groundwater table than the depth of groundwater table towards eastern part of the shear zone the shallow groundwater table at the northern part is also evident by the presence of lineaments the lineaments are trending in radial direction at northern part with high number of intersections towards south and south western part of the study area two set of lineaments are noticed with minimal number of intersections hence the shallow occurrence of groundwater table in the north and north eastern part of the study area is dominantly controlled by the presence of dyke towards south and south eastern part of the study area the nne ssw trending fracture systems are potential sources of groundwater which are evident by the presence of many wells along with the fracture system 5 conclusion the present study evaluated the use of remote sensing integrated with field investigations along with collateral data to study the various factors influencing the groundwater regime in the hard rock terrain of morappur area the study area morappur is a typical hard rock terrain and sedimentary litho units are absent hence it is difficult to identify the potential groundwater resources agriculture is the primary occupation and groundwater is exploited to a maximum extent due to limited surface water resources wells both tube and dug wells and tanks are the main sources for irrigation unscientific ways of exploiting the groundwater may cause degradation of the valuable land lowering of groundwater table and also financial loss to the farmers hence a scientific study has to be conducted to understand the groundwater regime of the area a good understanding of the relationship between lithological structural and geomorphic parameters and the groundwater regime has been achieved in the present study the geology of the study area mainly consists of charnockite and epidote hornblende gneiss instead of primary porosity porosity is offered by secondary porosity the drainage pattern is mainly dendritic to sub dendritic in nature the drainage system belongs to the ponnaiyar river basin and its tributaries the observed geomorphic units in the study area are structural hills bajada moderate and shallow buried pediments valley fills and tanks each hydro geomorphic units have its own contribution in the hydrogeological regime of the area tables 1 and 2 details the role and distribution each geomorphic unit the nne ssw trending fracture systems is the potential source of water the number of wells in the north of dyke is more than the south overall it is observed that the geomorphic units have major bearing on the groundwater regime while the structural elements that are the dyke system controls the groundwater flow in the region and not the groundwater abundance the significant lulc classes present in the study area are built up land crop land fallow land land with scrub and land without scrub the observation made in the field and information obtained from remote sensing images was employed and the analysis was made to derive meaningful inference about the relationship among groundwater regime geomorphology and structural elements of the study area this study proves the role of remote sensing in groundwater studies is not only confined to the preparation of hydro geomorphic map alone but also detailed synthesis of the structural details of the area which will give depth information about the groundwater regime acknowledgement the authors

12144,the goal of the present study is to identify the groundwater regime of morappur area at dharmapuri district india the study area covers an area of 410 sqkm the area belongs to a hard rock terrain where the primary porosity is feeble and the secondary porosity offered by fracture joints and shear zones etc contributes to the groundwater regime the availability of surface water resources is sparse and hence the groundwater repositories are intensely utilized in the current study area the availability of groundwater is limited due to scanty rainfall and poor recharge the entire study area underlain by hard crystalline rocks of archaean age charnokite and hornblende epidote gneiss are the main rock types encountered in the area the over exploitation of these resources more than the adequate recharge has resulted to decrease in the groundwater level in this context it is very much important to identify and understand the groundwater regime of this area for the better groundwater monitoring and conservation of this precious resource remote sensing and gis are playing a vital role in the advancement of hydro geological studies the use of conventional methods alone has its own limitations in comprehending the groundwater regime of the area the integrated study using remote sensing field studies together with gis has helped to understand the role of structural lithological and geomorphic units in controlling the groundwater occurrence and movement in the present study area various thematic maps were prepared from the satellite images and they were integrated and incorporated in a gis platform along with collateral information to study the groundwater regime of morappur area the outcome of this study clearly shows the importance of the geospatial studies in identifying the role of satellite imageries and geospatial techniques to understand the groundwater regime of a hard rock terrain graphical abstract image 1 keywords remote sensing gis groundwater regime hard rock terrain india 1 introduction the concept of the groundwater environment and regime is mainly based on the combination of physical factors such as climate topography and geology pael 1993 these factors and their components play a significant role in deciding the characters of the hydrogeological regime of an area the present study area is a hard rock terrain with limited groundwater resource and the recharge is also poor due to the scanty rainfall and poor replenishment the study of the groundwater regime of an area is important for groundwater monitoring and management agriculture is the primary occupation of the residents in this area the irrational and intense use of precious groundwater is a threat to the agriculture occupation and for other indispensable needs in future due to the tremendous growth of human population the natural resources suffer severe pressure to produce sufficient food and raw materials sitender 2015 hence the study of the groundwater regime is significant in this area the conventional methods alone will not be sufficient to carry out the current studies and also it will be time consuming the remote sensing and gis techniques are widely used in hydro geological studies but the geospatial approach will reduce the cost and time of the study many of the previous studies proved the importance and acceptance of the use of geospatial approaches in groundwater studies in hard rock terrain das et al 2007 vijith 2007 singh et al 2013 politi et al 2016 and most of the conventional field methods are typically site specific kishel and gerla 2002 see fig 1 groundwater accounts for about 30 of the earth s freshwater shiklomanov 1993 the over exploitation of groundwater resources will lead to ecological problems such as fall off groundwater levels water exhaustion water pollution deterioration of water quality and sea water intrusion yeh et al 2014 the occurrence and movement of groundwater resource mainly depend on the aquifer characteristics of the region which is directly or indirectly influenced by geology geological structures lithology geomorphology soil texture drainage patterns lineament land use land cover climate extent of fractures depth of weathering topography primary porosity secondary porosity slope rate of precipitation and infiltration rate mukherjee 1996 jaiswal et al 2003 shekhar and pandey 2014 selvam et al 2015 sathish and elango 2016 the groundwater occurrence in the hard rock region is dominantly controlled by secondary porosity such as fault fold joints etc das 2017 the distribution and migration of groundwater in hard rock terrains are variable and are dependent on the character origin and size of secondary porosity either formed by weathering or tectonic activity irrelevant to the availability of secondary porosity and its dimension the groundwater replenishment in the hard rock terrain takes place by rainfall as well geomorphic controls are also a deciding factor of the groundwater occurrence geological structures such as fault fold joints in shear zones have a major bearing on the groundwater aspects of any area elhag and elzien 2013 mohamed 2015 especially in hard rock terrain this is due to lack of primary porosity in these rocks except in the top most weathered horizon most of the parts of south india are characterized by crystalline and metamorphic rocks which are not rich in groundwater pullare 2006 in such instance they are the only secondary porosity which offered by joints fractures and shear zones that contribute to the groundwater regime the remote sensing satellite data can provide information regarding numerous factors which directly and indirectly controlling the occurrence and movement of groundwater in the aquifer engman gurney 1991 meijerink 1996 jha et al 2007 machiwal et al 2010 the gis provides a quick and efficient platform for managing the large database and complex spatial data and non spatial data for the sustainable natural resource management machiwal et al 2010 stafford 1991 the remote sensing data alone cannot be sufficient to provide the information of the groundwater regime of the area however the surface regime topographical hydrological geological landuse landcover which primarily governs the subsurface water conditions can be studied and mapped using remotely sensed image data in the context of such remote sensing for groundwater exploration the various surface features or indicators can be grouped into two categories viz 1 first order or direct indicators and 2 second order or indirect indicators the first order indicators are directly related to the groundwater regime viz recharge zones soil moisture and vegetation the second order indicators are those hydro geological parameters which regionally indicate the groundwater regime for e g rock soil types structures rock fractures landforms drainage characteristics etc anbazhagan et al 2005 therefore remote sensing plays a vital role and an efficient tool for regional and local groundwater exploration elbeih 2015 the geospatial techniques can provide quick and cost effective outputs with different spatial and temporal resolution the conventional methods demand a lot of money and energy but the geospatial studies are quick and cost effective remote sensing studies have been used as a major geospatial tool to map the various thematic maps of the morappur region geographical information system gives a platform for the integration of these thematic maps and other collateral data for this study in a drought prone area such as dharmapuri district tamilnadu state of south india has poor groundwater resources due to the excess use and poor recharge this hard rock terrain is mostly fed by the secondary porosity offered by the faults fractures joints etc in such a scenario it is essential to have a detailed understanding of the structural lithological and geomorphic detailsof the area to have a better picture of the groundwater regime the present study deals with mapping of structural lithological and geomorphic elements of the drought prone hard rock terrain in dharmapuri district 2 study area and data the study area fig 1 lies between the latitude 11 59ʹ32ʺ to 12 15ʹ54ʺ north and longitude 78 10ʹ 53ʺ to 78 24ʹ 42ʺ east covering an area of 410 sqkm in the dharmapuri district of

certain manipulations can be performed on the digital image so as to have better visual presentation or for information extraction from the enhanced images various thematic maps were produced the srtm dem is also used to understand the terrain information in detail the height information from the dem will give a better outline about the topography of the area the various thematic information obtained from the image data using envi software were integrated to the gis platform to verify the accuracy of the generated maps using satellite images and to add additional details in the maps and to collect data on groundwater parameters extensive field works have been carried out in the study area this field work included the following aspects traversing along and across the strike of formation in the study area mapping location and extent of the dykes in the study area observing different strike of the formation examining sample of the rocks and noting down the co ordinates examining noting down the position of the well location groundwater level and other detail in the entire study area observing and noting down various geomorphic land use and land cover in the study area photography of geological features in the study area the role of remote sensing is not only confined to the preparation of thematic maps alone but also to study the detailed synthesis of geological structural geomorphic maps and their integrated study with the other baseline information to understand the groundwater regime of the area the methodology fig 2 adopted in the study has been given in the following flowchart 4 results and discussion the different thematic maps were prepared using the visual interpretation analysis of satellite images along with the hydrogeological field investigations and available ancillary data for the study area the various thematic maps derived from the integrated data set include geology map geomorphology map structural map land use and land cover map drainge and drainage density map water level contour maps and the well location map the geospatial techniques serve as an effective and efficient tool for the better understanding of the groundwater potential zones muralitharan and palanivel 2015 of hard rock terrain 4 1 the various thematic maps and inferences 4 1 1 geology map the entire study area is underlain by hard crystalline rocks of archaean age comprising of various rock types such as gneiss charnockite etc the gneissic type of crystalline formation is found in the north and north eastern part of the district dharmapuri harur gopinathampatti and morappur areas are covered by epidote hornblende gneiss kadathur and kambainallur areas covered by charnockite and gabbro pyroxinite dolerite dyke varying from few feet to few miles in length and cuts across the country rock in this study area see fig 3 geological map fig 3 has prepared with help of published district resource map prepared by gsi on 1 250 000 scale and has been updated using satellite data the contact of the litho units can be accurately marked and extended using the tonal characteristic in satellite imagery with limited ground checking the structures like dyke faults and the extension can also be mapped from imagery because of the advantage of synoptic view however this data is reliable only if it is used in conjunction with ground truth and other information to get the best output for geological information accordingly adequate ground truth verification was also done by carrying out field work this study area consists of mainly charnockite and epidote hornblende gneiss which have been intruded by dykes of varying composition epidote hornblende gneiss is the second dominant rocks in the study area the gneiss which shows light yellowish green colour on the fcc image fig 4 mainly consists of plagioclase and potash feldspar gneisses are the oldest country rock in india see fig 5 4 1 2 geomorphology map the science of geomorphology is the study of topographic forms geomorphic units landforms fig 5 the geomorphic characters of a region have a very strong control on the groundwater regime of the area the study area includes structural denudational and fluvial landforms the major geomorphic units seen in the study area are structural hills bajada moderate and shallow buried pediments valley fills and tanks each geomorphic unit has varying effects on the groundwater regime applications of the principle of geomorphology provide information which will be of value in predicting the geometry of the aquifers on the weathering and erosion many geological formations develop land forms that are distinctive in respect of slope continuity of outcrops the surface topographic features of bedrock can be sometimes extrapolated to reasonable depths to predict the thickness of alluvium or aeolian sands occurring as valley field deposits and by treating slope profile those can be found it is well known that hydrologic processes are influenced by geomorphometric properties like local slope angle and drainage density from the groundwater point of view the integration of geological structural and hydrogeological data with hydrogeomorphological data is very much useful to understand the better information about groundwater regime with fruitful results satellite remote sensing has been found very useful in delineating geomorphic landform because of its synoptic view quick and inexpensive techniques for getting information various enhancement techniques also helped to identify the different landforms 4 1 2 1 residual hills these are isolated low relief and irregular outlines standing out predominantly and appear as isolated hills or continuous chains of hillocks due to differential erosion thus more resistance formation of rocks stands as residue like hills usually marked with structures such as joints and fractures etc these are poor for ground water prospecting due to steep gradient and the rain water is washed off immediately without much infiltration on standard fcc image it shows brownish tone due to exposed outcrops and varied reddish tone in some area due to partial growth of vegetation 4 1 2 2 pediments pediment is gently sloping area with erosional bedrocks situated between hills and plains consisting of a veneer of detritus and broad undulating rock floor these units generally act as run off zones and as well as recharge zone whenever fracture and their intersection are present the groundwater potential in pediments is poor except along with the fractures where limited quantity of ground water can be obtained for the domestic purpose 4 1 2 3 shallow buried pediments flat and smooth buried pediment with moderately thick 0 5 m over burden the groundwater potential in these geomorphic units is poor 4 1 2 4 moderately buried pediments flat and smooth buried pediment with moderately thick 5 20 m over burden the groundwater potential in these geomorphic units is moderate 4 1 2 5 bajada these are alluvial deposits of varying grain size deposited along the foothill zones which forms highly productive shallow aquifers 4 1 2 6 valley fills these are low lying depressions and negative land forms of varying size and shape occurring within the hills associated with stream course these are unconsolidated alluvial and colluvial materials partly or wholly filled in the valleys by streams and rivers the material in this surface consists of mainly weathered products of the surrounding rocks mostly comprised with moderately thick gravels pebbles sand and silt the prospect varies depending on the thickness of the fills valleys controlled by lineaments and fractures have good groundwater prospect and good potentials for agriculture also valley fills act as good groundwater potential zones and water table is shallow and they have very good groundwater prospects as they are being recharged by surrounding hills as well as by the river water deep bore wells are preferable in these zones for intensive agriculture on standard fcc image it exhibits reddish tone due to the presence of vegetation on screen visual interpretation of aster data has been carried out to identify various landforms taking into consideration of various image and terrain elements the landform which are more important in the ground water prospects tables 1 and 2 are classified into various broad categories and their distribution has been delineated from the remotely sensed data using standard image interpretation elements and the characters 4 1 3 structural map the structural map of the study area consists of lineaments shear zone faults and dykes remote sensing gives enormous facility in mapping the geological structures such as fold faults dykes and lineaments the occurrence and movement of ground water in the hard rock are limited to weathered jointed fractured and sheared zones lineaments are defined as a large scale linear feature which expresses itself in terms of topography and an expression of the underlying structural features lineaments or linear fractures are commonly associated with displacements deformations and prides pathways for groundwater movements these are important where secondary permeability and porosity dominate the lineaments intersection areas are considered as good groundwater potential zones a fault is a fracture or zone of fractures between two blocks of rock faults may range in length from a few millimeters to thousands of kilometers the south indian shield comprises of precambrian granite greenstone dharwar craton in the north bordered to the south by a mobile belt the south indian granulite terrain post archaean mafic igneous activity is wide spread in the form of dyke intrusions in the shield the dyke intrusions are quite spectacular in the immediate vicinity around the cuddapah basin the largest palaeoproterozoic sedimentary basin in the indian shield clusters of dyke intrusions are pervasive throughout the dharwar craton up to the west coast and also in the granulite region of the south india beyond which to the south the dyke intrusions are predominant only in the west coast the dykes are quite variable in lengths and thickness and mostly are fresh dolerites grading into gabbro in the interiors where the dykes are thick the role of structural features at the study area is the wnw ese trending fractures that have been filled by fracture and the nne ssw trending fracture system these structural elements have barring on the groundwater regime as follows the dyke filled fracture system acts as the defined barrier of the groundwater flow from northern region this is clearly evident that the lesser number of wells in the area of south of the dyke system compared to large number of wells in the north of the dyke system the nne ssw trending fracture systems are potential sources of groundwater which are evidence by the presence of many wells along with the fracture system fig 6 4 1 4 landuse and land cover map landuse refers to man activities and various uses which are carried out on land it describes how a parcel of land is used as agriculture settlement or industry landcover refers to natural vegetation water bodies rocks soils artificial cover and other resulting due to land transformation the term landuse landcover is closely related and interchangeable per the purpose of which land is being used they are commonly associated with different types of cover such as forest agriculture waste land or water bodies landuse landcover exerts considerable influence on the various hydrological phenomenon s such as interception infiltration evaporation and surface flow applications of satellite remote sensing for land use surveys and mapping is gaining importance because of its ability to provide rapid and reliable data within a given time of framework realizing the relationship between landuse and hydro geomorphology is important for planning and management activities sajith 2005 the landuse landcover map was prepared using satellite image in conjunction with soi top maps on 1 50 000 scales visual interpretation of landsat tm fcc was used to delineate various landuse landcover categories fig 7 landuse landcover categorization is envisaged based on the classification scheme developed by national remote sensing agency the landuse landcover characteristics were delineated based on the image characteristics like tone texture shape association etc during the interpretation wherever doubtful units are encountered the ground trouth survey was under taken to verify the same fig 7 describes the landuse landcover map of the study area the characteristics of landuse landcover classification are depicted in table 3 the landuse landcover classes identified in the study area are built up land cropland fallow land land with scrub land without scrub barren sheet rock stony waste area and tanks 4 1 4 1 built up land it is defined as an area of human habitation developed due to non agricultural use and that which has a cover of buildings transport communication utilities in association with water vegetation and vacant lands land used for human settlement in rural villages is comparatively less size than urban settlement 4 1 4 2 agricultural land it is defined as the land primarily used for farming and for production of food fiber and other commercial and horticultural crops it includes crops fallow lands and plantations 4 1 4 3 croplands it includes those lands with standing crops as on the date of satellite imagery the area under crops have been identified and mapped 4 1 4 4 fallow land it is described as agricultural land which is taken for cultivation but is temporarily allowed to rest uncropped for one more season but less than one year at the time of the imagery taken of both seasons these lands are seen particularly devoid of crops on the fcc fallow land shows yellow to greenish blue tone irregular shape with varying size associated with crop land or harvested agriculture field 4 1 4 5 forest it is an area baring an association predominantly of tree and other vegetation types capable of producing timer and other forest produce satellite data has been used for mapping different forest types and density classes with reliable accuracy through visual as well as digital techniques forest exerts influence on climate and water regime and also provides shelter for wildlife and livestock 4 1 4 6 land with scrub scrublands are seen along with the ridge and valley complex linear ridges and deep slope areas most of these areas are identified by the presence of thorny scrub and herb species many hillocks of steep and dumbbell shaped are associated with poor vegetal cover as a consequence severe soil erosion frequently occurs during rainy seasons resulting most of the hilltops become barren rocky 4 1 4 7 land without scrub land under these classes is generally prone to degradation deterioration it is confined to the higher topography like uplands or high ground etc and excludes hills and mountain terrains on fcc it shows light yellow to brown to greenish blue varying in size associated with gentle relief and moderate slope in plain and surrounded by agriculture lands 4 1 4 8 barren rock stony waste these are the lands characterized by exposed massive rocks sheet rocks stony pavements or land with excessive surface accumulation of stones that render them unsuitable for production of any green biomass such lands are easily discriminated from other categories of wastelands because of their characteristic spectral responds on fcc it shows greenish blue to yellow to brownish in tone with varying size association with steep isolated hillocks hill slopes and eroded plains 4 1 5 drainage and drainage density map the drainage system of the study area belongs to the ponnaiyar river basin and its tributaries from the study it is seen that the drainage is mostly of dentritic and sub dentritic pattern the spatial arrangement of streams giving rise to a particular design is called as drainage pattern the drainage pattern reflects original slope structures like folds faults joints and wrapping in the study area dentritic sub dentritic and trellis type of drainage patterns are observed in dentritic drainage pattern the network of tributaries of various orders and magnitudes joints the master stream and resembles like the branches of a tree the development of dentritic drainage is associated with the areas of homogenous lithology and gently sloping to almost horizontal or flat topographical surface having extremely low relief sub dentritic patterns differ from the dentritic only in the lack of perfection of development of streams dentritic and sub dentritic patterns are governed by regional slope homogenous lithology and relief babar and kaplay 1999 trellis drainage pattern tends to develop where there is strong structural control upon streams exist because of geology in such situations channels align themselves parallel to structures in the bedrock with minor tributaries coming at right angles fig 8 deals with the drainage and drainage density map of the study area 4 1 6 water level contour map the understanding of spatial and seasonal changes in the groundwater level is significant in the understanding of groundwater regime of the study area field investigations have been carried out to measure the groundwater level in the pre and post monsoon seasons the spatial variation of the measured groundwater level below ground surface for 2007 and 2008 has been given by the following fig 9 4 1 7 the well location map the groundwater is the main source of water and the presence of surface water is scanty the agriculture sector depended mainly on the groundwater resource a total of 780 number of wells both tube wells and dug wells are available in the study area from the well location map it is observed that around 450 wells were present at the northern side of the dykes above 220 wells are existing at the southern side of the dykes and about 110 wells are observed between the dykes the well location map has given in the fig 10 4 2 inferences this study aims at mapping of geological geomorphic units structural unit s landuse and landcover and relates them with the groundwater resources of part of morappur region of dharmapuri district south india the study of remote sensing evaluated the groundwater regime of the morappur area and identified the various factors which are influencing the groundwater in this hard rock terrain of dharmapuri district of tamil nadu it is essential to relate the lithology geology of the terrain and the groundwater regime charnockite and hornblende epidote gneiss are the main rock types encountered in this area the dykes traversing the entire study area along wnw ese direction are the other litho units that control the groundwater regime to support the above fact it can be observed that there are above 450 wells north of the dykes above 220 wells south of the dykes and 110 wells between the dykes thus it is observed that there are less than 50 of the number of wells in the area of south of the dykes compared to the area of north of the dykes since there is no sedimentary litho unit in the study area it may be concluded that the structural geomorphic and lithological aspects play a major role in groundwater regime of the area from the table 1 it is evident that the fluvial geomorphic units are the most promising groundwater regions followed by denudational landforms bajada deep pediments peniplain these units are followed by structural landforms structural hills linear ridges the above inference is a result of analyzing the number of wells present in each landforms it should be noted that the absence of wells in the nne part of the study area doesn t indicate poor groundwater condition but only suggests that the agriculture fields and villagers derive the water requirement from the ponnaiyar river and not from the subsurface in general the area can be divided into three units with regard to its groundwater occurrence they are 1 in northern and north eastern flood plain dominated groundwater regime 2 pedimentous low to moderate potential regime 3 the moderate to high potential regime in the valley fills and bajada regions the correlation of groundwater table at various seasons confirming the groundwater table is shallow during the period of post monsoon due to nonuniformity in the number of wells used for the preparation of spatial groundwater map the minor variations also noticed in the spatial variation in the groundwater table among various seasons overall the groundwater flow system is controlled by structural features that are clearly evident by spatial variation of groundwater table irrespective of various season two sets of fractures are present in the study area which are wnw ese trending fracture systems filled by dykes and the nne ssw trending fracture system which induces water permeability however the dykes filled fracture system act as definite barrier of the groundwater flow from northern region this is due to the presence of deeper groundwater table towards south west part of the fracture system occupied by dykes the geometry of dykes represents that the dykes are comparatively younger than the period of shear zone occurrence the comparison of groundwater table across the shear zone also representing the barrier effect of dykes in the groundwater control the wells located towards western part of the shear zone represent deeper groundwater table than the depth of groundwater table towards eastern part of the shear zone the shallow groundwater table at the northern part is also evident by the presence of lineaments the lineaments are trending in radial direction at northern part with high number of intersections towards south and south western part of the study area two set of lineaments are noticed with minimal number of intersections hence the shallow occurrence of groundwater table in the north and north eastern part of the study area is dominantly controlled by the presence of dyke towards south and south eastern part of the study area the nne ssw trending fracture systems are potential sources of groundwater which are evident by the presence of many wells along with the fracture system 5 conclusion the present study evaluated the use of remote sensing integrated with field investigations along with collateral data to study the various factors influencing the groundwater regime in the hard rock terrain of morappur area the study area morappur is a typical hard rock terrain and sedimentary litho units are absent hence it is difficult to identify the potential groundwater resources agriculture is the primary occupation and groundwater is exploited to a maximum extent due to limited surface water resources wells both tube and dug wells and tanks are the main sources for irrigation unscientific ways of exploiting the groundwater may cause degradation of the valuable land lowering of groundwater table and also financial loss to the farmers hence a scientific study has to be conducted to understand the groundwater regime of the area a good understanding of the relationship between lithological structural and geomorphic parameters and the groundwater regime has been achieved in the present study the geology of the study area mainly consists of charnockite and epidote hornblende gneiss instead of primary porosity porosity is offered by secondary porosity the drainage pattern is mainly dendritic to sub dendritic in nature the drainage system belongs to the ponnaiyar river basin and its tributaries the observed geomorphic units in the study area are structural hills bajada moderate and shallow buried pediments valley fills and tanks each hydro geomorphic units have its own contribution in the hydrogeological regime of the area tables 1 and 2 details the role and distribution each geomorphic unit the nne ssw trending fracture systems is the potential source of water the number of wells in the north of dyke is more than the south overall it is observed that the geomorphic units have major bearing on the groundwater regime while the structural elements that are the dyke system controls the groundwater flow in the region and not the groundwater abundance the significant lulc classes present in the study area are built up land crop land fallow land land with scrub and land without scrub the observation made in the field and information obtained from remote sensing images was employed and the analysis was made to derive meaningful inference about the relationship among groundwater regime geomorphology and structural elements of the study area this study proves the role of remote sensing in groundwater studies is not only confined to the preparation of hydro geomorphic map alone but also detailed synthesis of the structural details of the area which will give depth information about the groundwater regime acknowledgement the authors
