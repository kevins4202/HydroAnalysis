labyrinths to gaps regular pattern formation is common in nature but its ecological role in population dynamics is not well understood in this article we present a logistic probabilistic cellular automata lpca model that combines a basic logistic growth model with two dimensional spatial dynamics to simulate regular pattern formation for model generality only propagation and competition were assumed to occur in lpca and their dynamics follow local logistic growth simulation outcomes show that the resource scarcity and shape of the neighborhood are the main causes of different regular

mean field theory drylands 1 introduction regular pattern formation is very common in real ecosystems pringle and tarnita 2017 such as arid ecosystems klausmeier 1999 couteron and lejeune 2001 hillerislambers et al 2001 savanna ecosystems lejeune et al 2002 sternberg 2001 wetland ecosystems foster et al 1983 rietkerk et al 2004 wetzel et al 2005 koppel et al 2015 mussel beds koppel et al 2005 2008 and coral reefs mistr and bercovici 2003 somathilake et al 2018 due to self organization localized ecological interactions are repeated under homogeneous conditions spontaneously generating distinct emergent properties at a larger scale including regular pattern formation deutsch and dormann 2005 a number of cases of regular spatial patterning have been reported over the past 15 years pringle and tarnita 2017 the reported regular patterns including gaps labyrinths spots stripes and rings rietkerk and koppel 2008 pringle and tarnita 2017 share similar features and exhibit the same cluster size and grain pattern instead of random configurations theoretical ecologists increasingly emphasize that pattern formation has a close relationship with ecological stability diversity and catastrophic shifts rietkerk and koppel 2004 2008 koppel et al 2015 however how self organized regular patterns affect temporal population dynamics is not well understood hart and marshall 2009 crone and griffith 2016 an in depth understanding of the ecological roles of regular patterns is of vital importance for population management and sustainable development kauffman et al 2004 previous studies of spatial self organization were conducted under a well recognized framework of scale dependent positive and negative feedbacks sdfs pringle and tarnita 2017 rietkerk and koppel 2004 deangelis and yurek 2017 models under sdfs couple short distance positive feedbacks with long distance negative feedbacks to explain emergent spatial patterning which is based on the famous activator inhibitor principle rietkerk and koppel 2008 pringle and tarnita 2016 with the same theoretical foundation those ecological mechanisms are diversed and contingent on different types ecosystems or biological groups anderson and neuhauser 2002 thompson and daniels 2010 martínez garcía et al 2014 for model generality we adopt only two most intrinsic population behaviors propagation and competition that are ubiquitous among different sessile or semisessile populations following the minimum ecological requirements for regular pattern formation couteron and lejeune 2001 maruvka and shnerb 2006 martínez garcía et al 2014 we drew on logistic growth model one of the most fundamental models in ecology to describe their dynamics then we combined logistic growth model with spatially explicit probabilistic cellular automata pca to get the two dimensional spatial formulation since ca as important biological and ecological model system serve as important tool for spatial processes especially the interplay between propagation and competition anderson and neuhauser 2002 mendonça and gevorgyan 2017 firstly individual based pca can better describe stochastic and discrete individual behaviors in population concerning our primary focus on population dynamic simpson et al 2007 and the probabilistic transition rule in ca is representative of stochastic processes in nature wang et al 2003 secondly the exclusive space occupation of cell and concept of neighborhoods in ca offers a simpler method for space competition and local interaction than kernel based integro differential equations deutsch and dormann 2005 allowing for model simplicity and generality we introduce this logistic probabilistic cellular automata lpca model based previous work to study the growth of sessile organisms competing for space and resources boccara and fuks 1997 mendonça and gevorgyan 2017 the primary objective in this article is to study the role of regular patterns in vegetation dynamics hence we used mean field theory to deduce the mean field approximation mfa of lpca mean field theory concerns the behavior of complex stochastic models and simplifies interactions into an averaged effect kadanoff 2009 the mean field theory for ca is based on the assumption that the states of cells in the lattice are independent hatzikirou et al 2010 which means that mfa is able to eliminate the influence of particular spatial configurations and makes global predictions of the population dynamics of lpca therefore we compared the population dynamics of mfa to those of lpca to elucidate the role of regular patterns in population dynamics in summary we hypothesized that 1 propagation and competition can generate regular patterns and these specific spatial configurations cause spatially heterogeneous population dynamics followed by change in global dynamics and 2 regular pattern can stabilize population dynamics because of its self organizing characters 2 model definitions the logistic equation eq 1 first coined by verhulst 1838 is one of the most basic equations in ecology shnerb 2004 i e 1 d n d t r n k n k where n is population size t is time r is the intrinsic rate of natural increase and k is the carrying capacity however it is spatially implicit and assume perfect mixing of population in real ecosystem the dynamics of a plant is directly affected by its neighborhood thus spatial configuration inevitably influences global dynamics in order to incorporate spatial information we coined two parameters namely α and β that represent the resource consumption rate and resource supplementation rate to logistic growth model and get 2 δ n δ t r n 1 α n β n where n is the number of occupied cells in interaction neighborhood n and n is the total number of cells in n δ t is the time step for each iteration and r is the intrinsic rate of natural increase in particular β n is corresponding to carrying capacity k and α n reflect the influence from neighborhoods general ca are defined with four tuples the lattice space state set neighborhood and transition rule deutsch and dormann 2005 we will detail the four tuples in the following sections 2 1 lattice and cells the lpca are defined on a two dimensional lattice l with i i cells i n and the cells are of equal size r r is determined by the mean size of the study objects e g the cell for a tree takes meters as its scale and the cell for a moss takes centimeters as its scale 3 l n 2 r r r x r y r x 1 2 r y 1 2 the small square in a lattice is called a cell and is identified by its position r l in lpca a cell is either vacant or occupied by organisms thus we assign the cell a state value s r ε i e 4 s l ε ε 0 1 the multi cell configuration s ε l of the lattice is defined by the state value of ordered subset m i e 5 s s r i r i m m l 2 2 neighborhood and matrix due to the spatially implicit form of logistic growth model its predictions are often divergent from real population dynamics jongejans and de kroon 2005 therefore we incorporate local spatial interaction rules in lpca i e the temporal dynamics of a cell are only affected by its neighbors in our model two types of interaction neighborhoods n are adopted fig 1 isotropic neighborhoods cover a round region the von neumann neighborhood is a famous case with radius 1 which is defined as having a particular radius r i e 6 n i s o c c x c y c x c y r r c x 2 c y 2 r the interaction neighborhood could also be anisotropic for example stripes in arid ecosystems are closely related to sloped topography and resource flow and the resources flow alters the range of interactions in different directions aguiar and sala 1999 for generalization we introduce an anisotropic neighborhood that is a center skewed round region to embody the anisotropic local interaction resource flow also affects the shape of interaction neighborhood thus elliptical shape better matches reality but preliminary test demonstrated that elliptical shape only stretches patterns produced by round neighborhood the skewed center is the main cause for bands for better comparison of two neighborhoods we abandoned the elliptic shapes the anisotropic neighborhood n s is defined as 7 n a n i c c x c y c x c y r r c x s k x 2 c y s k y 2 r where s k y and s k x denote the skew of the cell from the center of the round region 2 3 transition rules the dynamics of lpca are determined by the local transition rule r ε n ε which follows the definition from eq 2 in real ecosystems ecological events are usually stochastic thus the probalistic transition rule r is adopted the updated cell state s r k 1 depends on two values n and s r k of cells in the neighborhood the exact transition probabilities are listed in table 1 the w 01 indicates propagation that vacant cells occupied by plant item 1 α n β n determines the local density dependent resource competition if 1 α n β n 0 the vacant cell has the potential to be occupied and the transition probability can be delineated by total growth δ t r n 1 α n β n divided by the size of the growth region n n to get growth probability per cell if 1 α n β n 0 over fierce resource competition leads to competitive exclusion w 10 the w 00 and w 11 indicate a cell remain previous state it is worth noting the transition probability should be between 0 and 1 thus a small δ t should be used 3 mfa for lpca mean field theory assumes that the states of cells in the lattice are independent at all times therefore we upfront give the general mean field equation for problistic ca deutsch and dormann 2005 8 x j k 1 z 1 z v ε v w z 1 z v z j i 1 v l 1 ε x l t δ z i z l where x j k 0 1 is a spatially averaged value denoting the expected density of a cell state z j on the lattice at iteration k z 1 z v denotes the configuration of neighborhood n and z 1 z v ε v traverses every possibility z 1 z v ε v and w is its corresponding transition probability to z j the i 1 v is a product of expected density for all cells in neighborhood where l 1 ε x l k δ z i z l denotes the expected density of state z j for cell i δ u v is the kronecker delta i e δ u v 1 if u v and δ u v 0 if u v in lpca there are only two states for a cell ε 0 1 thus x 1 x 0 1 the ergodic transition probability w z 1 z v z j defined in neighborhood space is more complicated therefore we group all possible states configuration of neighborhoods z 1 z v in lpca by occupied cell state s r k and the number of occupied cells n and obtain 9 x 1 k 1 n 0 n z 1 z n ε n z r 0 w 01 x 1 n x 0 n n z 1 z n ε n z r 1 w 11 x 1 n x 0 n n the contribution of each cell in neighborhood n to n is location independent thus the conditional sum can be refined as 10 z 1 z n ε n z r 0 w 01 x 1 n x 0 n n n 1 n w 01 x 1 n x 0 n n n 0 n 1 0 n n 11 z 1 z n ε n z r 1 w 11 x 1 n x 0 n n 0 n 0 n 1 n 1 w 11 x 1 n x 0 n n n 1 n combining eqs 9 10 and 11 the mean field equations for lpca are given by 12 x 1 k 1 n 0 n n δ t r n 1 α n β n n n n x 1 k n 1 x 1 k n n we rearrange the eq 12 into two summations i e 13 x 1 k 1 n 0 n δ t r β n β n δ t r α β n 2 n n n x 1 k n 1 x 1 k n n n 0 n δ t r α β n 2 n n 1 n n x 1 k n 1 x 1 k n n when n 0 or n 1 0 the item in equals to 0 then we change the lower bound of summation and binomial coefficient and get 14 x 1 k 1 δ t r β n β n δ t r α β n x 1 k n 1 n n 1 n 1 x 1 k n 1 1 x 1 k n n δ t r α n 1 β n x 1 k 2 n 2 n n 2 n 2 x 1 k 1 x 1 k n n according to binomial theorem the two summations equal to 1 we put δ x 1 x 1 k 1 x 1 k into eq 14 and get 15 δ x 1 δ t r x 1 k 1 α 1 x 1 k n 1 β n it clear shows that density dependent δ x 1 is influenced by n which suggests size of neighborhood affect dynamics the mfa can be applied to global scale that x 1 is equal to the number of occupied cells divided by the total cells number and neighborhood scale with x 1 n n in neighborhood scale the third item become 1 α n n 1 n 1 β n which is approximately equal to 1 α n β n with big n 4 parameterization and initiation we use a typical case of an arid ecosystem to parameterize the lpca model where water limitation is the main source of stress for vegetation β and α are the water supplementation rate in bare soil and water consumption rate of vegetation the reference ranges for parameters were based on water balance data from the shapotou desert experimental research station chinese academy of sciences list in table 2 the research station borders the tengger desert located in the central part of western china 37 27 n 104 57 e the climate at the site is characterized by abundant sunshine and a low relative humidity the mean annual precipitation is 188 2 mm 1952 2009 and the mean annual temperature is 9 6 c the potential evapotranspiration during the growing season may september is 2300 mm 2500 mm the windy season lasts from september to april with an average wind velocity of 2 6 ms 1 the dominant plants include caragana korshinskii artemisia ordosica and some herbaceous plants the setting of α and β are based on water balance i e p e t r d δ s where p e t r d and δs are precipitation evaporation transpiration surface runoff soil water recharge and soil water change respectively with millimeters mm as the units for simplicity we assume that r and δs equal 0 δs 0 means that the water budget of vegetation is balanced r 0 is common in drylands because such zones are dominated by small precipitation events li et al 2009 thus β is depicted by p e d which represents the net water supply without vegetation α is depicted by t because the assimilated water is negligible t uses the mean value of transpiration of caragana korshinskii and artemisia ordosica in principle this approximate parameterization is incorrect because these indexes are interdependent and context dependent li et al 2009 2014 zhang et al 2016 however the approximations capture the main concepts for water consumption α and water supplementation β thus they are useful and acceptable for lpca to initialize the lpca a randomly distributed lattice with a global density of 1 was set i e each cell in the initial lattice was assigned an equal probability p 0 01 of being occupied the boundary of real habitat is usually unlimited or fuzzy therefore we impose a periodic boundary condition for digital simulation the simulation time was set to 50 years 100 iterations then we set three levels of β table 2 combined with two kinds of neighborhoods fig 1 for simulations notably striped patterns are frequently related to resource flow or slope topography rietkerk and koppel 2008 pringle and tarnita 2017 therefore down slope shrub uses more resource from upslope that is the neighborhood skews upward given that we imposed the slope in the y direction sky was set to 1 in addition previous studies suggested that shrubs have lateral synergies caused by blockage of resource flow from stripes thiery et al 1995 deblauwe et al 2012 because of the absence of resource matrix lpca is not able to reflect this blockage therefore we used a surrogate method that skx adopted a random variable 2 or 2 with the same probabilities to make neighborhoods skew to two laterals because shrub uses more lateral resources by blockage source code in r version 3 5 2 is available from https github com agrostis sun lpca 5 results the spatial pattern of an assemblage can be described by scale and grain pattern scale describes the mean size between patches and gaps it is easy to imagine that pattern size is closely related to the size of the neighborhood n and cell r in lpca preliminary computation illustrated that even the smallest neighborhood e g the von neumann neighborhood could generate regular patterns pattern grain is this article is descriptive spots labyrinths gaps and stripes fig 3 displays the simulation process with 100 iterations 50 years where regular patterns gradually form and present sharpened edges when β 15 spots emerge in the pattern but the edges are noisy because of the probabilistic characters of lpca fig 2 a when β 35 labyrinths emerge where isolated patches intertangle with each other forming labyrinthine structure fig 2b and when β 55 gaps emerge that resembles the opposite version of spots with the highest density among the three fig 2c in general spots labyrinths and gaps share certain intrinsic similarities 1 they have the same pattern scales even with differences in density and 2 the shape and distribution of regular structures in patterns are isotropic in that they demonstrate uniformity in all orientations by contrast an anisotropic neighborhood generates stripes in the vegetation pattern the stripes broaden with increasing β but the scales remain the same the comparison between the lpca and mfa is shown in fig 3 where we ran the lpca model 1000 times to obtain the density distribution the confidence interval was set to 95 the mfa eq 15 is in the difference form to obtain a smoothed curve we transferred the mfa to the differential form and used a numerical solver for integration in general the shape of the neighborhood does not affect the outcome of mfa based on eq 15 the dynamics are only affected by the total number of the neighborhoods n in addition the growth rate in the mfa is slightly faster than that in the lpca in the early iterations t 5 because the spatial configuration dampens the global growth rate through uneven propagation and competition in latter iterations the trajectories are divergent among different values of β when resource supplementation is low β 15 final population size is higher in lpca than in mfa when resource supplementation is moderate β 35 the growth trajectories are generally the same and when resource supplementation is high β 55 vegetation density in the lpca increases to the same level as that in mfa and then gradually decrease in sum the simulation results suggest that regular patterning could regulate population size which complies with our first hypothesis 6 discussion in the simulation of lpca spots labyrinths and gaps emerge on the lattices fig 3 indicating that propagation and competition alone can generate regular patterns in line with couteron and lejeune 2001 previous studies basically followed a similar scenario in which neighboring individuals facilitating each other by resources concentration or stress amelioration produce short range positive feedbacks while distant individuals at a high density generate long range negative feedbacks by resource competition pringle and tarnita 2017 gilad et al 2004 kletter et al 2009 however mechanisms of facilitation are disputable in many cases and not ubiquitous among ecosystems brooker et al 2008 couteron and lejeune 2001 martı nez garcı a et al 2013 thus we used propagation instead in order to release the prerequisite of regular pattern formation from facilitation given that propagation and competition are generally thought to be intrinsically density dependent and scale dependent in nature couteron and lejeune 2001 koppel et al 2015 the propagation adopted in lpca is significantly different from that in fisher s reaction diffusion equation fisher 1937 with two order laplacian operator for dispersal by contrast our propagation and death are coupled in transition rules table 1 and reflect scale dependence where n couples the spatial scale and feedback because n reflect the size of regular structures and transition probability w 01 w 10 altogether in a neighborhood taking spots structure as an example small size of a spot small n relates positive feedback for local population while big spot large n causes senescence and shrinkage of spots from competition by these means the pattern formation of lpca is still under the framework of sdfs the simulation also demonstrates that regular patterns emerge when 0 β α 1 which suggests that resource scarcity is the main driver of regular spatial patterns this finding was also reported by lejeune et al 2002 in which an interaction redistribution model was proposed to study vegetation dynamics as in this article the interaction redistribution model also abstracted different kinds of resources in general the patterns shift from spots and labyrinths to gaps as resource scarcity diminishes fig 2 under extreme condition stable homogeneity in spatial pattern occurs when β α or β 0 in addition to resource scarcity the shape of the neighborhood also affects pattern grains fig 2 a c shows that patterns generated by isotropic neighborhoods have no preference in direction this finding accords with earlier observations in the patagonian steppe soriano et al 1994 where shrubs can establish in any location with spotted vegetation patches by contrast anisotropic neighborhoods generate stripes on the lattice fig 2 d f and the stripes broaden with decreased resource scarcity this finding is in line with previous evidences that the establishment of shrubs in banded vegetation on slopes exhibits anisotropy thiery et al 1995 that is the building phase of shrubs occurs upslope of the vegetation bands and the degenerative phase occurs downslope thiery et al 1995 aguiar and sala 1999 in addition the simulation shows that stripes move upward opposite to resource flow which accords with observations of deblauwe et al 2012 this finding further strengthens our confidence in lpca mean field theory is commonly used to predict the global behavior of complex systems and this bottom up method provides a useful spatially implicit approximation irrespective of spatial variation kadanoff 2009 based on the comparison between the lpca and the mfa we conclude that there are two different phases in spatially explicit population growth the logistic growth phase t 5 and the pattern formation phase t 5 the logistic growth phase is characterized by local density dependence in which local density and particular spatial configurations affect global growth the results show that the mfa increases slightly faster than the lpca which suggests that nonuniform distributions may dampen population growth and the logistic growth model may overestimate the overall growth in addition we perform 1000 simulations with different initial lattices and find more variation e g the width of the confidence interval in the logistic growth phase which further emphasizes the influence of spatial configuration on population dynamics by contrast in pattern formation phase the pattern changes from being random to aggregated and clear edges for localized structures form in about 50 years fig 3 besides the propagation based positive feedback in lpca is relatively weak compared to the one resulting from resource concentration couteron and lejeune 2001 thus we expected that the pattern formation phase would be shorter with these mechanisms spatially implicit models sims usually aim to develop ecological theory or reveal ecological generality however top down methods are often subject to contingencies in nature which affect their predictions deangelis and yurek 2017 lawton 1999 by contrast spatially explicit models sems try to use small scale collective rules to cope with practical problems at larger scales calabrese et al 2010 there is a major gap between sims and sems need to bridge since these two types of models often produce discrepant results and predictions deangelis and yurek 2017 from this point of view the comparison between lpca and mfa can supplement the logistic growth model the main concept of mfa is to replace all local interactions with an average interaction kadanoff 2009 therefore it is supposed that if the lattice has a random distribution then all local interactions are equal thus mfa is accurate for lpca generally the trajectories of lpca and mfa are same and the linear stability analysis in terms of mfa appendix a shows that the final density x 1 βn α α n 1 is globally stable to disturbances which also imply the regular patterns as the indicator sable state for arid system simulation also reveals that when populations are randomly distributed t 5 fig 3 the densities are equal between lpca and mfa given this result the comparison between lpca and mfa in the pattern formation phase becomes a comparison between a regular pattern and a random pattern fig 3 shows that in the pattern formation phase regular patterns alter population size under harsh conditions β 15 the equilibrium density predicted from mfa is significantly lower than that from lpca spatial self organization may be an underappreciated means to maximize resource utilization in the formation of isolated spots under milder conditions β 35 labyrinth patterns exhibit the same equilibrium density in both the lpca and mfa and the growth trajectories are nearly identical when β 55 the population reaches a climax equal to the equilibrium density of mfa and then declines which suggests that the formation of gaps may cause self thinning these findings are rather encouraging thus we plotted the relationships between the equilibrium population densities of lpca and mfa along a gradient of resource supplementation rates fig 4 b the discrepancy between the two lines points to the role of regular patterns on equilibrium density that regular patterns help maintain a more stable community size in order to investigate this discrepancy we define β n α n as potential resource pr that is negatively related to competition and plot it for spots case then we plot the rank potential resource distribution of cells in lattice for different resource supplementation rates β fig 4a results show that occupied cells happen to be on the spots with positive pr while the vacant cells locate on spots with negative pr which forms a counter intuitive spatial pattern that the patches occupied by plants have higher pr while vacant place underdoes fierce resource competition in addition frequent population dynamics occur in edges of occupied patches where p r 0 which means that the regular pattern confines the population dynamics to the edge parts of plant patches and guarantee redundant potential resource for occupied cells as a result regular patterns systematically regulate the population dynamics in a stable manner and maintains stability for population compared to that in random distribution this result also explains the wider variation of density in logistic growth phase than in pattern formation phase fig 3 fig 5 is the schematic plot for spots patterns that black circles are shrub patches and the circles around them are their neighborhoods it is easy to imagine the strong competition from adjacent spots that intersectional regions suffer thus with increasing β plants gradually occupy the place from the highest pr to lower pr accompanying the pattern transferring form spots to labyrinths to gaps to sum up when patterns form the distribution of cells form this particular distribution of pr in return this distribution of pr strengthens the distribution of cells in addition lpca simulation in long time showed hexagonal combination support that as well because this arrangement provides best coverage of two dimensional space pringle and tarnita 2016 in summation the results highly suggest regular pattern as optimized spatial configuration to balance space and resource competition declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

anonymous reviewers for his constructive comments and suggestions appendix a linear stability analysis in order to gain insight into pattern formation phenomena in the lpca we perform linear stability analysis of the discrete nonlinear mfa from eq 15 1 x 1 k 1 h 1 x 1 k δ t r x 1 k 1 α 1 x 1 k n 1 β n x 1 k x 0 k 1 h 0 x 1 k 1 h 1 x 1 k we analyze the steady state solutions x x 0 x 1 t which makes x k 1 x k k n with respect to small spatially heterogeneous local perturbations δ x k x k x close to fixed point x then we take first order taylor expansion of h x δ x k to obtain linear approximation of δ x t 1 2 δ x k 1 j δ x k 1 j h 0 x 0 h 0 x 1 h 1 x 0 h 1 x 1 x hence δ x k j k δ x 0 and the dynamics of the perturtation δ x k are determined by the jacobi matrix j especially by the spectral radius 3 μ m a x λ λ e i g e n v a l u e s o f j from eq 1 x 1 gets two steady state solutions 0 and β n α α n 1 accordingly we get the spectral radius 4 μ 1 r δ t α r δ t β n i f x 1 0 1 r δ t α r δ

there exists a constant c that makes δ x k c δ x 0 for all times k n which all perturbations are bounded we put the values table 2 in shapotou region to eq 19 and find that μ 1 x 1 0 and μ 1 x 1 β n α α n 1 this result indicate that the regular pattern is the sable spatial configuration for arid system other spatial patterns will eventually evolve to regular patterns

studies of spatial self organization were conducted under a well recognized framework of scale dependent positive and negative feedbacks sdfs pringle and tarnita 2017 rietkerk and koppel 2004 deangelis and yurek 2017 models under sdfs couple short distance positive feedbacks with long distance negative feedbacks to explain emergent spatial patterning which is based on the famous activator inhibitor principle rietkerk and koppel 2008 pringle and tarnita 2016 with the same theoretical foundation those ecological mechanisms are diversed and contingent on different types ecosystems or biological groups anderson and neuhauser 2002 thompson and daniels 2010 martínez garcía et al 2014 for model generality we adopt only two most intrinsic population behaviors propagation and competition that are ubiquitous among different sessile or semisessile populations following the minimum ecological requirements for regular pattern formation couteron and lejeune 2001 maruvka and shnerb 2006 martínez garcía et al 2014 we drew on logistic growth model one of the most fundamental models in ecology to describe their dynamics then we combined logistic growth model with spatially explicit probabilistic cellular automata pca to get the two dimensional spatial formulation since ca as important biological and ecological model system serve as important tool for spatial processes especially the interplay between propagation and competition anderson and neuhauser 2002 mendonça and gevorgyan 2017 firstly individual based pca can better describe stochastic and discrete individual behaviors in population concerning our primary focus on population dynamic simpson et al 2007 and the probabilistic transition rule in ca is representative of stochastic processes in nature wang et al 2003 secondly the exclusive space occupation of cell and concept of neighborhoods in ca offers a simpler method for space competition and local interaction than kernel based integro differential equations deutsch and dormann 2005 allowing for model simplicity and generality we introduce this logistic probabilistic cellular automata lpca model based previous work to study the growth of sessile organisms competing for space and resources boccara and fuks 1997 mendonça and gevorgyan 2017 the primary objective in this article is to study the role of regular patterns in vegetation dynamics hence we used mean field theory to deduce the mean field approximation mfa of lpca mean field theory concerns the behavior of complex stochastic models and simplifies interactions into an averaged effect kadanoff 2009 the mean field theory for ca is based on the assumption that the states of cells in the lattice are independent hatzikirou et al 2010 which means that mfa is able to eliminate the influence of particular spatial configurations and makes global predictions of the population dynamics of lpca therefore we compared the population dynamics of mfa to those of lpca to elucidate the role of regular patterns in population dynamics in summary we hypothesized that 1 propagation and competition can generate regular patterns and these specific spatial configurations cause spatially heterogeneous population dynamics followed by change in global dynamics and 2 regular pattern can stabilize population dynamics because of its self organizing characters 2 model definitions the logistic equation eq 1 first coined by verhulst 1838 is one of the most basic equations in ecology shnerb 2004 i e 1 d n d t r n k n k where n is population size t is time r is the intrinsic rate of natural increase and k is the carrying capacity however it is spatially implicit and assume perfect mixing of population in real ecosystem the dynamics of a plant is directly affected by its neighborhood thus spatial configuration inevitably influences global dynamics in order to incorporate spatial information we coined two parameters namely α and β that represent the resource consumption rate and resource supplementation rate to logistic growth model and get 2 δ n δ t r n 1 α n β n where n is the number of occupied cells in interaction neighborhood n and n is the total number of cells in n δ t is the time step for each iteration and r is the intrinsic rate of natural increase in particular β n is corresponding to carrying capacity k and α n reflect the influence from neighborhoods general ca are defined with four tuples the lattice space state set neighborhood and transition rule deutsch and dormann 2005 we will detail the four tuples in the following sections 2 1 lattice and cells the lpca are defined on a two dimensional lattice l with i i cells i n and the cells are of equal size r r is determined by the mean size of the study objects e g the cell for a tree takes meters as its scale and the cell for a moss takes centimeters as its scale 3 l n 2 r r r x r y r x 1 2 r y 1 2 the small square in a lattice is called a cell and is identified by its position r l in lpca a cell is either vacant or occupied by organisms thus we assign the cell a state value s r ε i e 4 s l ε ε 0 1 the multi cell configuration s ε l of the lattice is defined by the state value of ordered subset m i e 5 s s r i r i m m l 2 2 neighborhood and matrix due to the spatially implicit form of logistic growth model its predictions are often divergent from real population dynamics jongejans and de kroon 2005 therefore we incorporate local spatial interaction rules in lpca i e the temporal dynamics of a cell are only affected by its neighbors in our model two types of interaction neighborhoods n are adopted fig 1 isotropic neighborhoods cover a round region the von neumann neighborhood is a famous case with radius 1 which is defined as having a particular radius r i e 6 n i s o c c x c y c x c y r r c x 2 c y 2 r the interaction neighborhood could also be anisotropic for example stripes in arid ecosystems are closely related to sloped topography and resource flow and the resources flow alters the range of interactions in different directions aguiar and sala 1999 for generalization we introduce an anisotropic neighborhood that is a center skewed round region to embody the anisotropic local interaction resource flow also affects the shape of interaction neighborhood thus elliptical shape better matches reality but preliminary test demonstrated that elliptical shape only stretches patterns produced by round neighborhood the skewed center is the main cause for bands for better comparison of two neighborhoods we abandoned the elliptic shapes the anisotropic neighborhood n s is defined as 7 n a n i c c x c y c x c y r r c x s k x 2 c y s k y 2 r where s k y and s k x denote the skew of the cell from the center of the round region 2 3 transition rules the dynamics of lpca are determined by the local transition rule r ε n ε which follows the definition from eq 2 in real ecosystems ecological events are usually stochastic thus the probalistic transition rule r is adopted the updated cell state s r k 1 depends on two values n and s r k of cells in the neighborhood the exact transition probabilities are listed in table 1 the w 01 indicates propagation that vacant cells occupied by plant item 1 α n β n determines the local density dependent resource competition if 1 α n β n 0 the vacant cell has the potential to be occupied and the transition probability can be delineated by total growth δ t r n 1 α n β n divided by the size of the growth region n n to get growth probability per cell if 1 α n β n 0 over fierce resource competition leads to competitive exclusion w 10 the w 00 and w 11 indicate a cell remain previous state it is worth noting the transition probability should be between 0 and 1 thus a small δ t should be used 3 mfa for lpca mean field theory assumes that the states of cells in the lattice are independent at all times therefore we upfront give the general mean field equation for problistic ca deutsch and dormann 2005 8 x j k 1 z 1 z v ε v w z 1 z v z j i 1 v l 1 ε x l t δ z i z l where x j k 0 1 is a spatially averaged value denoting the expected density of a cell state z j on the lattice at iteration k z 1 z v denotes the configuration of neighborhood n and z 1 z v ε v traverses every possibility z 1 z v ε v and w is its corresponding transition probability to z j the i 1 v is a product of expected density for all cells in neighborhood where l 1 ε x l k δ z i z l denotes the expected density of state z j for cell i δ u v is the kronecker delta i e δ u v 1 if u v and δ u v 0 if u v in lpca there are only two states for a cell ε 0 1 thus x 1 x 0 1 the ergodic transition probability w z 1 z v z j defined in neighborhood space is more complicated therefore we group all possible states configuration of neighborhoods z 1 z v in lpca by occupied cell state s r k and the number of occupied cells n and obtain 9 x 1 k 1 n 0 n z 1 z n ε n z r 0 w 01 x 1 n x 0 n n z 1 z n ε n z r 1 w 11 x 1 n x 0 n n the contribution of each cell in neighborhood n to n is location independent thus the conditional sum can be refined as 10 z 1 z n ε n z r 0 w 01 x 1 n x 0 n n n 1 n w 01 x 1 n x 0 n n n 0 n 1 0 n n 11 z 1 z n ε n z r 1 w 11 x 1 n x 0 n n 0 n 0 n 1 n 1 w 11 x 1 n x 0 n n n 1 n combining eqs 9 10 and 11 the mean field equations for lpca are given by 12 x 1 k 1 n 0 n n δ t r n 1 α n β n n n n x 1 k n 1 x 1 k n n we rearrange the eq 12 into two summations i e 13 x 1 k 1 n 0 n δ t r β n β n δ t r α β n 2 n n n x 1 k n 1 x 1 k n n n 0 n δ t r α β n 2 n n 1 n n x 1 k n 1 x 1 k n n when n 0 or n 1 0 the item in equals to 0 then we change the lower bound of summation and binomial coefficient and get 14 x 1 k 1 δ t r β n β n δ t r α β n x 1 k n 1 n n 1 n 1 x 1 k n 1 1 x 1 k n n δ t r α n 1 β n x 1 k 2 n 2 n n 2 n 2 x 1 k 1 x 1 k n n according to binomial theorem the two summations equal to 1 we put δ x 1 x 1 k 1 x 1 k into eq 14 and get 15 δ x 1 δ t r x 1 k 1 α 1 x 1 k n 1 β n it clear shows that density dependent δ x 1 is influenced by n which suggests size of neighborhood affect dynamics the mfa can be applied to global scale that x 1 is equal to the number of occupied cells divided by the total cells number and neighborhood scale with x 1 n n in neighborhood scale the third item become 1 α n n 1 n 1 β n which is approximately equal to 1 α n β n with big n 4 parameterization and initiation we use a typical case of an arid ecosystem to parameterize the lpca model where water limitation is the main source of stress for vegetation β and α are the water supplementation rate in bare soil and water consumption rate of vegetation the reference ranges for parameters were based on water balance data from the shapotou desert experimental research station chinese academy of sciences list in table 2 the research station borders the tengger desert located in the central part of western china 37 27 n 104 57 e the climate at the site is characterized by abundant sunshine and a low relative humidity the mean annual precipitation is 188 2 mm 1952 2009 and the mean annual temperature is 9 6 c the potential evapotranspiration during the growing season may september is 2300 mm 2500 mm the windy season lasts from september to april with an average wind velocity of 2 6 ms 1 the dominant plants include caragana korshinskii artemisia ordosica and some herbaceous plants the setting of α and β are based on water balance i e p e t r d δ s where p e t r d and δs are precipitation evaporation transpiration surface runoff soil water recharge and soil water change respectively with millimeters mm as the units for simplicity we assume that r and δs equal 0 δs 0 means that the water budget of vegetation is balanced r 0 is common in drylands because such zones are dominated by small precipitation events li et al 2009 thus β is depicted by p e d which represents the net water supply without vegetation α is depicted by t because the assimilated water is negligible t uses the mean value of transpiration of caragana korshinskii and artemisia ordosica in principle this approximate parameterization is incorrect because these indexes are interdependent and context dependent li et al 2009 2014 zhang et al 2016 however the approximations capture the main concepts for water consumption α and water supplementation β thus they are useful and acceptable for lpca to initialize the lpca a randomly distributed lattice with a global density of 1 was set i e each cell in the initial lattice was assigned an equal probability p 0 01 of being occupied the boundary of real habitat is usually unlimited or fuzzy therefore we impose a periodic boundary condition for digital simulation the simulation time was set to 50 years 100 iterations then we set three levels of β table 2 combined with two kinds of neighborhoods fig 1 for simulations notably striped patterns are frequently related to resource flow or slope topography rietkerk and koppel 2008 pringle and tarnita 2017 therefore down slope shrub uses more resource from upslope that is the neighborhood skews upward given that we imposed the slope in the y direction sky was set to 1 in addition previous studies suggested that shrubs have lateral synergies caused by blockage of resource flow from stripes thiery et al 1995 deblauwe et al 2012 because of the absence of resource matrix lpca is not able to reflect this blockage therefore we used a surrogate method that skx adopted a random variable 2 or 2 with the same probabilities to make neighborhoods skew to two laterals because shrub uses more lateral resources by blockage source code in r version 3 5 2 is available from https github com agrostis sun lpca 5 results the spatial pattern of an assemblage can be described by scale and grain pattern scale describes the mean size between patches and gaps it is easy to imagine that pattern size is closely related to the size of the neighborhood n and cell r in lpca preliminary computation illustrated that even the smallest neighborhood e g the von neumann neighborhood could generate regular patterns pattern grain is this article is descriptive spots labyrinths gaps and stripes fig 3 displays the simulation process with 100 iterations 50 years where regular patterns gradually form and present sharpened edges when β 15 spots emerge in the pattern but the edges are noisy because of the probabilistic characters of lpca fig 2 a when β 35 labyrinths emerge where isolated patches intertangle with each other forming labyrinthine structure fig 2b and when β 55 gaps emerge that resembles the opposite version of spots with the highest density among the three fig 2c in general spots labyrinths and gaps share certain intrinsic similarities 1 they have the same pattern scales even with differences in density and 2 the shape and distribution of regular structures in patterns are isotropic in that they demonstrate uniformity in all orientations by contrast an anisotropic neighborhood generates stripes in the vegetation pattern the stripes broaden with increasing β but the scales remain the same the comparison between the lpca and mfa is shown in fig 3 where we ran the lpca model 1000 times to obtain the density distribution the confidence interval was set to 95 the mfa eq 15 is in the difference form to obtain a smoothed curve we transferred the mfa to the differential form and used a numerical solver for integration in general the shape of the neighborhood does not affect the outcome of mfa based on eq 15 the dynamics are only affected by the total number of the neighborhoods n in addition the growth rate in the mfa is slightly faster than that in the lpca in the early iterations t 5 because the spatial configuration dampens the global growth rate through uneven propagation and competition in latter iterations the trajectories are divergent among different values of β when resource supplementation is low β 15 final population size is higher in lpca than in mfa when resource supplementation is moderate β 35 the growth trajectories are generally the same and when resource supplementation is high β 55 vegetation density in the lpca increases to the same level as that in mfa and then gradually decrease in sum the simulation results suggest that regular patterning could regulate population size which complies with our first hypothesis 6 discussion in the simulation of lpca spots labyrinths and gaps emerge on the lattices fig 3 indicating that propagation and competition alone can generate regular patterns in line with couteron and lejeune 2001 previous studies basically followed a similar scenario in which neighboring individuals facilitating each other by resources concentration or stress amelioration produce short range positive feedbacks while distant individuals at a high density generate long range negative feedbacks by resource competition pringle and tarnita 2017 gilad et al 2004 kletter et al 2009 however mechanisms of facilitation are disputable in many cases and not ubiquitous among ecosystems brooker et al 2008 couteron and lejeune 2001 martı nez garcı a et al 2013 thus we used propagation instead in order to release the prerequisite of regular pattern formation from facilitation given that propagation and competition are generally thought to be intrinsically density dependent and scale dependent in nature couteron and lejeune 2001 koppel et al 2015 the propagation adopted in lpca is significantly different from that in fisher s reaction diffusion equation fisher 1937 with two order laplacian operator for dispersal by contrast our propagation and death are coupled in transition rules table 1 and reflect scale dependence where n couples the spatial scale and feedback because n reflect the size of regular structures and transition probability w 01 w 10 altogether in a neighborhood taking spots structure as an example small size of a spot small n relates positive feedback for local population while big spot large n causes senescence and shrinkage of spots from competition by these means the pattern formation of lpca is still under the framework of sdfs the simulation also demonstrates that regular patterns emerge when 0 β α 1 which suggests that resource scarcity is the main driver of regular spatial patterns this finding was also reported by lejeune et al 2002 in which an interaction redistribution model was proposed to study vegetation dynamics as in this article the interaction redistribution model also abstracted different kinds of resources in general the patterns shift from spots and labyrinths to gaps as resource scarcity diminishes fig 2 under extreme condition stable homogeneity in spatial pattern occurs when β α or β 0 in addition to resource scarcity the shape of the neighborhood also affects pattern grains fig 2 a c shows that patterns generated by isotropic neighborhoods have no preference in direction this finding accords with earlier observations in the patagonian steppe soriano et al 1994 where shrubs can establish in any location with spotted vegetation patches by contrast anisotropic neighborhoods generate stripes on the lattice fig 2 d f and the stripes broaden with decreased resource scarcity this finding is in line with previous evidences that the establishment of shrubs in banded vegetation on slopes exhibits anisotropy thiery et al 1995 that is the building phase of shrubs occurs upslope of the vegetation bands and the degenerative phase occurs downslope thiery et al 1995 aguiar and sala 1999 in addition the simulation shows that stripes move upward opposite to resource flow which accords with observations of deblauwe et al 2012 this finding further strengthens our confidence in lpca mean field theory is commonly used to predict the global behavior of complex systems and this bottom up method provides a useful spatially implicit approximation irrespective of spatial variation kadanoff 2009 based on the comparison between the lpca and the mfa we conclude that there are two different phases in spatially explicit population growth the logistic growth phase t 5 and the pattern formation phase t 5 the logistic growth phase is characterized by local density dependence in which local density and particular spatial configurations affect global growth the results show that the mfa increases slightly faster than the lpca which suggests that nonuniform distributions may dampen population growth and the logistic growth model may overestimate the overall growth in addition we perform 1000 simulations with different initial lattices and find more variation e g the width of the confidence interval in the logistic growth phase which further emphasizes the influence of spatial configuration on population dynamics by contrast in pattern formation phase the pattern changes from being random to aggregated and clear edges for localized structures form in about 50 years fig 3 besides the propagation based positive feedback in lpca is relatively weak compared to the one resulting from resource concentration couteron and lejeune 2001 thus we expected that the pattern formation phase would be shorter with these mechanisms spatially implicit models sims usually aim to develop ecological theory or reveal ecological generality however top down methods are often subject to contingencies in nature which affect their predictions deangelis and yurek 2017 lawton 1999 by contrast spatially explicit models sems try to use small scale collective rules to cope with practical problems at larger scales calabrese et al 2010 there is a major gap between sims and sems need to bridge since these two types of models often produce discrepant results and predictions deangelis and yurek 2017 from this point of view the comparison between lpca and mfa can supplement the logistic growth model the main concept of mfa is to replace all local interactions with an average interaction kadanoff 2009 therefore it is supposed that if the lattice has a random distribution then all local interactions are equal thus mfa is accurate for lpca generally the trajectories of lpca and mfa are same and the linear stability analysis in terms of mfa appendix a shows that the final density x 1 βn α α n 1 is globally stable to disturbances which also imply the regular patterns as the indicator sable state for arid system simulation also reveals that when populations are randomly distributed t 5 fig 3 the densities are equal between lpca and mfa given this result the comparison between lpca and mfa in the pattern formation phase becomes a comparison between a regular pattern and a random pattern fig 3 shows that in the pattern formation phase regular patterns alter population size under harsh conditions β 15 the equilibrium density predicted from mfa is significantly lower than that from lpca spatial self organization may be an underappreciated means to maximize resource utilization in the formation of isolated spots under milder conditions β 35 labyrinth patterns exhibit the same equilibrium density in both the lpca and mfa and the growth trajectories are nearly identical when β 55 the population reaches a climax equal to the equilibrium density of mfa and then declines which suggests that the formation of gaps may cause self thinning these findings are rather encouraging thus we plotted the relationships between the equilibrium population densities of lpca and mfa along a gradient of resource supplementation rates fig 4 b the discrepancy between the two lines points to the role of regular patterns on equilibrium density that regular patterns help maintain a more stable community size in order to investigate this discrepancy we define β n α n as potential resource pr that is negatively related to competition and plot it for spots case then we plot the rank potential resource distribution of cells in lattice for different resource supplementation rates β fig 4a results show that occupied cells happen to be on the spots with positive pr while the vacant cells locate on spots with negative pr which forms a counter intuitive spatial pattern that the patches occupied by plants have higher pr while vacant place underdoes fierce resource competition in addition frequent population dynamics occur in edges of occupied patches where p r 0 which means that the regular pattern confines the population dynamics to the edge parts of plant patches and guarantee redundant potential resource for occupied cells as a result regular patterns systematically regulate the population dynamics in a stable manner and maintains stability for population compared to that in random distribution this result also explains the wider variation of density in logistic growth phase than in pattern formation phase fig 3 fig 5 is the schematic plot for spots patterns that black circles are shrub patches and the circles around them are their neighborhoods it is easy to imagine the strong competition from adjacent spots that intersectional regions suffer thus with increasing β plants gradually occupy the place from the highest pr to lower pr accompanying the pattern transferring form spots to labyrinths to gaps to sum up when patterns form the distribution of cells form this particular distribution of pr in return this distribution of pr strengthens the distribution of cells in addition lpca simulation in long time showed hexagonal combination support that as well because this arrangement provides best coverage of two dimensional space pringle and tarnita 2016 in summation the results highly suggest regular pattern as optimized spatial configuration to balance space and resource competition declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

anonymous reviewers for his constructive comments and suggestions appendix a linear stability analysis in order to gain insight into pattern formation phenomena in the lpca we perform linear stability

24911,it is increasingly recognized that incorporating life history trade offs into evolutionary demography models requires trade offs to be decomposed into fixed a k a genetic and individual a k a dynamic components this is fundamental in order to understand how trade offs are related to fixed and dynamic components of individual heterogeneities and generate variance in individual trajectories therefore embedding such trade offs into population projection matrices usually requires three categories a life history determining trait e g age or stage a fixed trait incorporating the genetic trade off and a dynamic trait modeling the individual component this has proved a complex exercise until the recent advent of multitrait population projection matrices mppms 1 1 mppm multitrait i e multi category population projection matrix recent developments of trait level analysis tla 2 2 tla trait level analysis a toolbox for mppms developed by coste et al 2017 tools for mppms now allow us to study the demographic and evolutionary consequences of each component of a life history trade off here we illustrate this by constructing and analyzing an evolutionary demography model that implements both dynamic and fixed components of the costs of reproduction the trade off between current early reproduction and future later fitness in particular we explain and describe the use of the tla to measure the effects of this trade off on individual fitness here we focus on the variance of lifetime reproductive success between models implementing the individual costs and asymptotically equivalent matrices from which they are absent this allows us to show that dynamic costs decrease that variance and more so for slow organisms therefore accounting for this component of the costs instead of classically focusing solely on fixed costs of reproduction is paramount in order to correctly assess the relative importance of the neutral and adaptive components of individual heterogeneity keywords trait level analysis life history theory life history trade offs multitrait population projection matrices evolutionary demography individual heterogeneity hyperstate matrix models 1 introduction trade offs are at the core of life history theory they occur when an increase in fitness due to a change in one trait is opposed by a decrease in fitness due to a concomitant change in the second trait roff and fairbairn 2007 p 433 these life history trade offs lhtos 3 3 lhto life history trade off without which nature would be filled with darwinian demons law 1979 are deemed ubiquitous they are studied by the various fields of evolutionary biology that make up life history theory and in particular three of them in quantitative genetics they are a major component of the g matrix lande 1982 physiologists focus on the mechanistic constraints mainly homeostatic yielding trade offs for instance because of a y shaped allocation of finite resources orton 1929 lack 1954 cody 1966 behavioral ecologists study environmentally mediated trade offs e g jessup and bohannan 2008 paradoxically however lhtos have rarely been implemented into evolutionary demography models this can be due to technical difficulties in doing so or because population and individual mechanisms are studied by different families of models while trade offs act at both these levels see appendix a however this shortcoming is most likely caused by demographers early realization that the classical classification of lhtos into physiological behavioral and genetic trade offs see appendix b lacks clarification pertaining to conceptual differences overlaps or equivalences between these three families as discussed in stearns 1992 roff 1993 to be implementable into evolutionary demography models trade offs require a novel typology that provides a proper demographic decomposition instead of a mechanistic classification we argue that this can be achieved by projecting onto the field of population projection matrices ppms the decomposition of individual heterogeneity into fixed and dynamic components devised by tuljapurkar steiner and orzack tuljapurkar et al 2009 steiner et al 2010 tuljapurkar and steiner 2010 itself leading to the decomposition of demographic traits a k a categories into static and dynamic classes vindenes and langangen 2015 instead of merely classifying trade offs according to the assumed locations of their constraint mechanisms this novel typology of trade offs decomposes lhtos into two components with respect to the means by which they affect phenotypic variance the first component is the fixed at birth component a k a genetic fixed or static it can be heritable because some of the phenotypic variance stems from genetic variance because of shared parent offspring environments or because of epigenetics in this paper for simplification we focus on fixed components of lhtos which are genetically fixed however the concepts and the model can be extended to incorporate other forms of fixed trait heritability when applied to trade offs such a genetic component of a lhto or simply genetic lhto generates a gradient of coexisting strategies in the population some lineages having a constantly better trait a and a worse trait b than others the second component is the individual component a k a dynamic individual lhtos encompass the mechanistic internal or external individual constraints that organisms have to deal with at every timestep of their lives when for instance allocating a limited amount of energy between two traits within a particular environment individual lhtos yield different possible realizations of each of the aforementioned strategies via their interaction with individual stochasticity in other words individuals of the same genetically determined life history strategy may experience different life history trajectories due to luck caswell 2009 tuljapurkar et al 2009 snyder and ellner 2018 therefore using the current nomenclature see steiner and tuljapurkar 2012 cam et al 2016 hamel et al 2018 we can write that the fixed component of trade offs generates adaptive heterogeneity and the individual component controls neutral heterogeneity the decomposition of a trade off into fixed and individual components is additive and can therefore be implemented into ppms we argue that such an implementation would benefit life history theory and evolutionary demography it would for instance enable measuring the evolutionary importance of the individual component of lhtos which is usually considered to have no evolutionary effects as their demographic consequences average out in large populations snyder and ellner 2018 here we implement both genetic and individual components of the costs of reproduction cor 4 4 cor costs of reproduction the most prominent of all trade offs according to stearns 1989 as it directly relates the two highest level components of fitness cor is the trade off between current early reproduction and future later fitness i e future later survival and reproduction the genetic component of such a trade off consists of the intraspecific gradient in strategies along the slow fast continuum slower lineages promote higher survival and therefore longevity at the cost of fertility compared to faster lineages the individual component of the cor reduces the vital rates of individuals as they exert reproductive efforts however since reproductive and survival events are subject to individual stochasticity i e to chance the realization of this trade off over the several timesteps of an individual life trajectory follows itself a stochastic process indeed two individuals sharing the same genetic fixed strategy may end up with very different trajectories as individual stochasticity in reproductive realizations generate deviations from the central strategy evolved by the lineage in order to incorporate both genetic and individual components of the cor into a ppm we build a three trait mppm indeed incorporating trade offs requires at least three traits the usual life history determining trait e g age size or stage a fixed trait embedding the genetic trade off and a dynamic trait incorporating the individual component the construction of such mppms has recently been streamlined roth and caswell 2016 coste et al 2017 moreover a new analytical tool the trait level analysis tla see coste et al 2017 now allows us to analyze the demographic and evolutionary importance of each trait in an mppm coste et al 2017 applied to a model implementing trade offs the tla makes it possible to measure the evolutionary consequences of the fixed and the individual components of a lhto here to investigate the cor we use a very common life history determining trait in the literature of demographic models age incorporating the individual component of the costs requires a trait that accounts for the accumulated reproductive efforts of individuals we use parity which tracks the number of offspring ever born in order to implement the fixed component of the costs we introduce a trait strategy that positions a lineage along the intraspecific slow fast continuum the parent s strategy being possibly inherited by its daughter we therefore construct an age parity strategy mppm projecting over time a population encountering both fixed and individual cor this three trait mppm is then analyzed via the tla in order to disentangle the evolutionary and demographic effects of each component the mppm is considered in a general form however the tools presented can readily be applied for a model built from empirical data see appendix c for illustrative and practical purposes we reduce the number of degrees of freedom to the fewest possible but such a model can also be built with numerous fixed and individual components this model is obviously too simple to be a proper population genetics model as this would also require the incorporation of new alleles generated via molecular mutations and of diploidy i e be a two sex model both limitations are common in extensions of projection models towards population genetics see e g de vries and caswell 2019 moreover this model cannot be considered a quantitative genetics one as this would require the ability to incorporate a continuous trait space however turning the mppm into an integral population model rees et al 2014 would allow the model to be extended from discrete to continuous trait values it is however not the aim of this article to develop a population or quantitative genetics model but to show how the addition of carefully chosen traits onto a demographic model can yield via the tla invaluable information about the evolutionary importance of the studied trade offs to perform such an analysis we focus on a key fitness measure lifetime reproductive success lrs considered as a random variable it measures the number of offspring produced by an individual in the population during its lifetime the expectation of lrs is the much used net reproductive rate r 0 the variance of lrs is denoted σ lrs 2 whereas the growth rate λ is often used as a genotype or population measure of fitness either as λ 1 the dominant eigenvalue for deterministic models or as λ s the stochastic growth rate for models incorporating environmental or demographic variance lrs is an individual measure many authors consider it a less relevant fitness measure than λ at the population level because it does not account for life pacing and reproductive rhythm nur 1984 murray 1992 giske et al 1993 indeed lrs loses track of chronological time a major shortcoming for models with overlapping generations however it has the advantage of being an individual measure readily aggregated at the population level this is not the case for λ despite efforts to conceive an individual growth rate however still difficult to fathom mcgraw and caswell 1997 initial results stemming from the application of tla to cor are already known see for instance the reducing effects of individual cor on selection gradients in coste et al 2017 but most still remain to be investigated here we focus on the effects of the individual component of costs on σ lrs 2 by comparing models implementing this trade off and asymptotically equivalent matrices from which it is absent via an operation called folding see coste et al 2017 we analyze how these effects depend on the position of species lineages on the slow fast continuum generated by genetic cor in particular we will show that individual cor decrease the variance in reproductive success and do so more strongly in slow organisms than fast ones we will also show that neglecting individual costs and focusing solely on fixed costs which is a common practice in evolutionary demography can yield to overestimating the neutral component of fixed heterogeneity at the expense of the adaptive one 2 materials and methods 2 1 theoretical mppm for both components of cor in order to disentangle the effects of individual and fixed components of costs the vital rates i e fertility and survival rates are decomposed into two independent components first the strategy is modeled by the zero parity vital rates the vital rates of individuals which have yet to reproduce a slower strategy will have lower zero parity fertility but higher zero parity survival rates than a faster one but both lineages may have the same fitness the same growth rate at the population level this spectrum of strategies constitutes the fixed component of cor second these zero parity vital rates are then linearly reduced with increased parity possibly down to zero this parity effect models the individual components of cor since the changes in parity value is a stochastic process that depends on reproductive history and demographic stochasticity thus the vital rates vr a p st vr being either a survival or fertility rate of an individual of age a parity p and strategy st are provided by the following formula 1 vr a p st 1 p β α 1 vr a 0 st parity effect zero parity vital rates individual comp of costs genetic comp of costs where α and β are the ages at first and last reproduction and for parsimony zero parity vital rates are independent of age a and therefore only dependent on strategy st as an individual of a fast strategy with large zero parity fertility rates is expected to encounter high reproductive success early in adult life it will have on average lower fertility rates late in life than an individual of a slower strategy that will have had fewer offspring at that point however it is possible in this model to consider an individual of a fast strategy but limited reproductive success because of bad luck that will have higher fertility rates late in life than a very and unexpectedly successful slow individual since the model incorporates several strategies we have to define a generation transmission parameter for the purpose of illustration we therefore incorporate parameter μ that represents the probability for an offspring to be of a different strategy than its parent when only two strategies are considered we have 0 μ 0 5 and this generates a scenario where differing for its parent s strategy can only mean switching from one to the other a quite unrealistic scenario from a population genetics standpoint in that case if μ 0 5 strategies are randomly distributed at birth i e the strategy is not heritable we denote l this generic formal age parity strategy mppm in expression 2 we illustrate a particular l for an organism with maximum age ω 3 years age at first reproduction α 2 years and age at last reproduction β 3 years with a slow lineage left half of the matrix in blue colours are added for clarity in the online version with zero parity vital rates s and f and a fast lineage right half of the matrix in red with zero parity vital rates s and f with s s and f f parity can be 0 or 1 there are actually two possible fertility events in every life trajectory but here individuals of parity 2 have an abundance of zero as they have reached maximum lifespan and are therefore not accounted for having parity of 1 divides individual fertility by a factor of 2 compared to having a parity of 0 in an mppm the state of an individual depends on its position according to several trait category axes this state of an individual or individual state corresponds to the i state of metz and diekmann 1986 and from now on we shall refer to it simply as state these states form a space the space of states or state space which is a product space the order in which traits are nested in the space of states is crucial to its construction and analysis its knowledge is required in order to generate the trait structure as per coste et al 2017 here the space of states is three dimensional and trait age is nested into trait parity and both into trait strategy formally it means that the i th element of abundance vector n which matrix l projects over time represents the abundances of individuals of age a parity p and strategy st for which a ω p ω par st i with par the number of parity classes which can be calculated as par min β α 2 ω α 1 each a p st combination corresponds to one and only one position 1 i ω par 2 in n and each of these 1 i ω par 2 indices corresponds to one and only one a p st triplet here this means that the state corresponding to trait triplet a p st will occupy position a 3 p 6 st in the space of individual states we equate st 0 with the slow strategy and st 1 with the fast one for instance this means that individuals of age 2 parity 0 and fast strategy will occupy position 8 in n abundance vector n is of length ω par 2 i e here 3 2 2 12 and l of size 12 12 vital rates for parities of 1 are represented in lighter shades than the zero parity rates such that l can be written as 2 2 2 folding the age parity strategy mppm the tla of an mppm aims at understanding the demographic and evolutionary importance of traits for the dynamics of a population coste et al 2017 it is the trait counterpart of the classical sensitivity elasticity analysis to matrix entries goodman 1971 caswell 1978 de kroon et al 1986 in order to measure the sensitivity of fitness values or any other asymptotic measure to traits the tla asks how these values are affected by the folding of the matrix over one or several of its categories a k a traits folding as detailed by coste et al 2017 consists in merging states i e combinations of traits or matrix entries sharing the same values for the traits to be folded upon in a manner that preserves the asymptotic flows of individuals between those states simply put ergodic flow preserving merging of matrix entries consists in summing the outgoing transitions and averaging the incoming ones weighted by asymptotic abundances this approach has been theorized by enright et al 1995 hooley 2000 and salguero gómez and plotkin 2010 folding at the core of the tla extends the operation of efp merging from states to traits in the case of mppm l incorporating the traits parity and strategy successive foldings over these traits provide information on the respective consequences of the individual and genetic components of cor we hereafter denote l age parity fold l age strategy fold and l age fold the matrix l respectively folded over strategy over parity and over both matrix l age fold is also called the reference leslie matrix and its comparison with l provides information regarding the evolutionary importance of both individual and genetic components of the cor as an illustration of the folding mechanism from the formal 3 year model described above in expression 2 with α 2 β 3 and 2 strategies we draw a specific model l 1 with two iso fitness genotypes of asymptotic growth rate λ r 0 1 we denote λ here the dominant eigenvalue of the deterministic matrix in this case vital rates are f 0 95 and s 0 7541 for the fast strategy and f 0 7013 and s 0 9 for the slow strategy reproduction is considered as a random process constituted of bernoulli independent trials one offspring maximum per timestep the transmission parameter is μ 0 25 we get all transition probabilities between individual states are rounded off to the nearest ten thousandth 3 its normalized right eigenvector w l 1 19 87 15 00 0 57 0 0 10 75 19 87 17 87 4 78 0 0 11 29 t where each entry is rounded off to the nearest hundredth can be written in 3 dimensional form as from the latter we can construct the weight matrices wght and from the characteristics of the traits to be folded upon the trait structure one can compute the block folding permutation matrices p bf which together generate the folding matrices as per eq 4 in coste et al 2017 this yields l 1 age strategy fold i e l 1 folded over trait parity a population model where both fixed and individual components of the costs were initially accounted for but where individual costs are no longer implemented 4 calculation wise in the particular case of this illustration the fertility rate for 3 year old slow individuals in l 1 age strategy fold 0 3741 can be easily obtained by averaging the corresponding fertility rates in l 1 0 7125 for the individuals of parity 0 and 0 3563 for the individuals of parity 1 with weights corresponding to the relative abundances of these two states 0 57 0 57 10 75 for the individuals of parity 0 and 10 75 0 57 10 75 for the individuals of parity 1 matrix l 1 age fold is the reference leslie matrix obtained by folding l 1 over the parity and strategy traits a ppm where cor are accounted for but not implemented 5 l 1 age fold 0 8147 0 4733 0 8271 0 8335 vital rates are an input of the initial matrix l 1 embedding cor as for classical matrix models however they are an output of the folded models for these folded models the induced vital rates can be gathered directly or computed from the entries of the matrices in our illustration vital rates for the reference leslie matrix l 1 age fold are readily readable in eq 5 on the first line fertility rates and the subdiagonal survival rates each of the two block matrices one for each strategy of l age strategy fold can also be treated as such eq 4 with regards to l age parity fold calculations are similar fertilities are to be found on the first line and the other entries sum up column wise to the survival rates note however that the interpretation of l age parity fold and for that matter of any multitrait model folded over one of its dynamic trait is to be treated with care see supplementary material s 1 by construction λ is preserved by folding but what about r 0 in the general case this is not true see supplementary material s 2 in the particular case of mppms with trait age however r 0 is preserved by folding proof in supplementary material s 3 note that as ppms project populations over time it is always possible to incorporate age as a trait therefore as for λ the effects of lhtos on r 0 will be measured by their consequences on the higher moments of lrs and chiefly its variance σ lrs 2 2 3 variance in reproductive success for mppms for mppms with both dynamic and fixed traits the calculation of σ lrs 2 requires the use of a tool for which the fertility processes are not formalized as vectors of moments per input state i but as a matrix containing the different moments of fertility for an individual surviving from state i to state j a markov chain with rewards mcwr is such a tool where the reward matrix can implement the various moments of f the fertility stochastic process as a function of both ends of an i j transition we will thus use mcwrs to compute variance σ lrs 2 for the age parity strategy mppm l to describe the mcwr mathematical framework introduced by howard 1960 and hatori 1966 we will use the approach of caswell 2011 who was the first to have applied this tool to demography the mcwr framework requires two instruments first t which is t of size q q where q is the number of states the usual survival transition matrix upon which absorbing state death is explicitly added in the q 1 th position of the matrix t t 0 m 1 m is the vector of mortality rates i e m 1 1 t where 1 denotes the q dimensional vector of ones matrix t is a stochastic matrix columns sum to 1 that fully describes the markov chain of all possible survival trajectories that any individual in the population can follow before being absorbed by death second the family of reward matrices rw k where rw k ij is the k th moment of the random variable of the reward i e here the birth of 1 offspring for an individual transitioning from state j to state i whenever no trade off involving fertility is involved matrices rw k have rank 1 with all lines equal to the fertility rate vector in l however current reproductive success does not only depend on the state i a p st of the individual but also on the state j it is transitioning toward in detail if j a 1 p 1 st then reproduction is being successful as parity is increased by one unit and thus its expectation is rw j i 1 1 if j a 1 p st the individual survives but does not reproduce at that timestep then rw j i 1 0 finally if j death the individual dies at the end of the period then because fertility and survival processes are independent of their respective realizations they are not independent per se as their probability rates depend on their states which are equal rw death i 1 f i this completes the construction of the reward matrix rw 1 it is therefore a zero matrix with the exception of 0 its lower sub diagonal made of 1 s and its bottom row corresponding to fertility rates because the reproductive rewards are the outcome of bernoulli independent trials either 0 or 1 offspring in our particular illustration reward matrices for any moment rw k are equal to the reward matrix of means rw 1 let ρ k be the vector of the k th moment of lrs indexed on individuals starting states these are calculated as the convergence of backwards accumulation of remaining rewards following individuals from death where no remaining reward remains to birth or age a 1 from caswell et al 2011 we draw the following convergence equations for the first two moments 6 ρ 1 lim t ρ 1 t with ρ 1 t 1 t rw 1 1 t ρ 1 t 7 ρ 2 lim t ρ 2 t with ρ 2 t 1 t rw 2 1 2 t rw 1 ρ 1 t t ρ 2 t and with initial conditions ρ 1 0 ρ 2 0 0 is the hadamard or elementwise product let us now reduce all lrs moments ρ k to states of age a 1 and thus p 0 i e to the offspring states then ρ 1 and ρ 2 are of size the number of classes of trait strategy then the vectors of expectancy and of variance of lrs for each offspring class are 8 e lrs ρ 1 9 σ lrs 2 ρ 2 ρ 1 ρ 1 3 results effects of individual costs on σ lrs 2 we aim at measuring some of the effects of the cor on σ lrs 2 the variance in lifetime reproductive success specifically we focus on comparing the variance of lrs between models implementing the individual costs and asymptotically equivalent matrices from which they are absent i e folded over parity to be able to provide such results we have constructed mppms that incorporate the individual and or the genetic component s of cor via the traits parity and strategy in the following sections we first investigate the overall effect of individual costs on σ lrs 2 second we compare the strength of this effect along the gradient of genetic costs to determine whether the position of a lineage on the slow fast continuum has an effect on the strength of individual costs on individual fitness finally we investigate the consequences of these results for the relative importance of adaptive and neutral components of individual heterogeneity 3 1 individual costs reduce the variance in lifetime reproductive success in supplementary material section s 4 we formally demonstrate eq 18 that individual cor reduce σ lrs 2 indeed we show that for l an age parity mppm embedding individual costs and l age fold denoted l in this section and the next with a as for the rest of the parameters related to the folded model its folded daughter from which individual cor are absent we have 10 σ lrs 2 l σ lrs 2 l this result is achieved by focusing on the parity distributions at demographic stable state of the successive age classes in both models in other words the individual costs buffer individual stochasticity here we illustrate this by analyzing an age parity strategy mppm incorporating individual costs for multiple strategies that do not interact i e μ 0 the different strategies can be seen as corresponding to different populations we therefore performed our investigation on multiple age parity mppms each corresponding to a specific strategy and each incorporating individual cor to better understand the effects of the individual costs on σ lrs 2 we plot in fig 1 the difference in variance for a constructed age parity matrix l with the individual costs and its folded reference leslie matrix l l age fold without the costs for a range of zero parity fertility and survival rates more precisely fig 1a depicts the difference in variance σ lrs 2 l σ lrs 2 l and fig 1b the difference in coefficient of variation σ lrs 2 r 0 l σ lrs 2 r 0 l for reference we also plot σ lrs 2 l in fig 1c and the iso fitness curves for both λ and r 0 in fig 1d the first observation is that individual cor indeed reduce variance fig 1a and coefficient of variation fig 1b of lrs the second observation is that the effects of cor on σ lrs 2 fig 1a follow the general shape of σ lrs 2 itself fig 1c the shape of σ lrs 2 as a function of zero parity rates f and s reveals that it results from the combined effects of three parameters first the variance in fertility rates at each age var f a f a 1 f a which is the engine of the variance in lrs and confers to the latter the x 1 x shape of the former along the zero parity fertility rate axis the importance of var f a for late ages however requires survival and thus the increase in σ lrs 2 as survival increases at the same time as age increases we have on average a decrease in f a because of the costs therefore even very high zero parity fertility rates conferring no variance in f a at early ages will generate variance at late ages hence the asymmetrical x 1 x shape at high survival rates across fertility rates finally survival does not only act as a promoter of variance in fertility but as a stochastic process itself of variance s i 1 s i which explains the decrease in variance as survival reaches its maximum levels these last two effects explain the general location in this model of the maximum σ lrs 2 reached by organisms with zero parity survival fertility coordinates of s 0 94 f 0 64 this general shape namely the x 1 x pattern on zero parity fertility axis and general increase with survival is preserved when switching from σ lrs 2 l fig 1c to σ lrs 2 l σ lrs 2 l fig 1a this is because this difference is a linear function of variance itself as shown in eq 17 supplementary material s 4 however this equation shows the difference in variance to also linearly depend on survival and fertility this explains why the difference in variance between models with and without the costs fig 1a increases with survival even at high survival rates and is flat at very low survival rates these patterns are preserved when correcting for r 0 i e for high fertility and survival rates as can be observed from the differential in the coefficient of variation fig 1b logically both the exponential increase with survival and the asymmetrical effect for high fertility disappear these observations demonstrate that even though very short lived or semelparous organisms i e with s 0 exhibit variance in reproductive success fig 1c the individual cor do not affect them fig 1a and 1 b and that the effects of the costs will increase with iteroparity longevity let us now investigate further the various effects of individual cor on iso fitness organisms across the slow fast continuum 3 2 effects of individual cor for iso fitness organisms across the slow fast continuum from an evolutionary life history perspective comparing the life histories of organisms with very different fitness makes little sense therefore from the statistics plotted in fig 1 for all possible zero parity vital rates we extract the combinations that are iso fitness more precisely in fig 2 we represent for each possible zero parity fertility rate the corresponding zero parity survival rate for a fitness of λ r 0 1 red curve right y axis for each such pair of coordinates we extract the variances in lrs for the models with and without the costs grey curves left y axis and their difference green curve left y axis this establishes for the particular case of organisms that are iso fitness the general conclusions drawn above here all organisms have stationary growth rate and therefore r 0 is worth unity the variance in reproductive success stems from both variance in fertility and survival and is therefore maximal for intermediary values of f and s however survival is also required to promote late fertility and this pushes s max higher and therefore f max lower than the point of equal coordinates f 0 54 s 0 54 as expected because of the individual cor this is less true for l for which s max is lower and therefore f max higher than for l to the contrary the differential in variances between the two models green curve is maximal for the maximum possible survival rate s 1 and its related zero parity fertility rate f 0 22 in other words this result shows that whilst the effect of individual stochasticity is not a monotonous function of the pace of organisms as measured by their position on the slow fast continuum stearns 1983 gaillard et al 1989 the effects of individual cor on such individual stochasticity decrease with pace and are maximum for slow organisms 3 3 combining effects of genetic and individual costs on σ lrs 2 in supplementary material s 5 we demonstrate that individual costs and fixed heterogeneity caused e g by genetic costs act independently and additively on σ lrs 2 in particular the fixed heterogeneity component of the variance in lifetime reproductive success is unaffected by individual costs in other words this formally demonstrates the intuitive perception that individual costs act solely on the dynamic heterogeneity component of individual fitness variance we also show there that the individual costs increase the relative importance of the fixed aka adaptive heterogeneity component of σ lrs 2 as it remains constant whilst the dynamic aka neutral component of heterogeneity is reduced we illustrate this by providing σ lrs 2 and its decomposition for a numerical application of l expression 2 we call l 2 the mppm for which age at first reproduction is α 1 maximum age ω 15 the zero parity vital rates for the fast genotype f 0 35 and s 0 6 and for the slow genotype f 0 3 and s 0 8 the decomposition of variance σ lrs 2 for l 2 and l 2 parity fold its folded version over parity from which individual costs are absent yields σ lrs 2 l 2 parity fold 1 2040 σ lrs 2 dyn l 2 parity fold 0 0362 σ lrs 2 fix l 2 parity fold σ lrs 2 l 2 1 0439 σ lrs 2 dyn l 2 0 0362 σ lrs 2 fix l 2 we observe that as expected the fixed component of the variance decomposition i e the adaptive heterogeneity component is small compared to the dynamic i e neutral component here σ lrs 2 dyn represents 96 6 of σ lrs 2 as theoretically calculated also the fixed component of the variance decomposition is preserved by folding over parity i e when considering individual costs or not finally and most importantly we observe that the implementation of individual cor increases the relative value of the adaptive component by 14 8 the ratio of 0 0362 1 204 0 0362 to 0 0362 1 0439 0 0362 incorporating the individual components of the multiple lhtos at play in an organism will increase this value further this allows us to contemplate the adaptive component of individual heterogeneity as a stronger factor than sometimes anticipated see steiner and tuljapurkar 2012 caswell 2014 cam et al 2016 snyder and ellner 2018 hamel et al 2018 4 discussion in this article we provide the steps allowing an ecologist to implement the dynamic and fixed components of a life history trade offs lhtos into a mppm and to analyze their effects on the evolutionary dynamics of a population specifically we focus on the two components individual and genetic of the costs of reproduction cor and their effects on the variance in lifetime reproductive success σ lrs 2 the random variable lrs is a commonly used measure of individual fitness and its expectation is the ubiquitous r 0 e lrs the genetic fixed component of cor is caused by intra population variance in pleiotropic genes acting on survival and fertility in other words it generates a gradient of strategies along the intra population slow fast continuum stearns 1983 gaillard et al 1989 the individual dynamic component of cor is related to the variance in individual trajectories caused by individual stochasticity individuals of the same strategy may indeed exhibit different life trajectories this is of course because of the randomness in vital rates but also because the latter are affected with stochasticity by the individual costs i e by the fact that past reproductive realizations negatively affect vital rates this general decomposition of lhtos into genetic fixed and individual dynamic components is important for evolutionary demography as it is additive and can therefore be integrated into population projection matrices ppms following this decomposition we demonstrate how to generate a multitrait population projection matrix mppm coste et al 2017 incorporating these two components for the cor the genetic costs are embedded via a fixed trait that positions the lineage s strategy slow or fast along the slow fast continuum the individual costs are implemented via dynamic trait parity the number of offspring ever born that tracks individual reproductive success by reducing the mean vital rates of individuals that have been successful so far in their life trajectory individual costs control dynamic heterogeneity the age parity strategy mppm l is then analyzed via a trait level analysis tla coste et al 2017 it consists in this case in comparing the properties of the full model l with asymptotically equivalent folded versions of l from which traits parity and or strategy are absent and therefore where the related dynamic and or fixed cor are also concealed from this analysis we formally demonstrate that individual cor have a cushioning effect on the variance of reproductive success eq 10 we then investigate how the strategy of a lineage its position on the genetic cor influences this buffering effect we show that the individual costs have a stronger impact on the variance in reproductive success of long lived organisms than on that of slow lived organisms of the same fitness for very short lived ones thus almost semelparous the individual costs have almost no demographic buffering effect finally as it reduces the variance in reproductive success individual costs have a buffering effect on individual heterogeneity we show in this respect that individual cor only affect the dynamic component of σ lrs 2 therefore the dynamic component of the costs which is often discarded to the benefit of its genetic fixed counterpart especially in comparative studies acts solely on the neutral component of individual heterogeneity the key result in this paper namely the buffering effect of individual cor on the dynamic component of the variance in reproductive success has far reaching consequences for evolutionary demography and most importantly for the measurement of the relative contributions of the fixed and dynamic component of individual heterogeneity via integral projection models or ppms it implies that when ecologists ignore the individual components of the multiple lhtos at play in an organism and only implements the fixed or genetic components they compute a correct measure for the fixed component of heterogeneity but overestimate the dynamic component potentially to a large degree if the organism is subject to many trade offs this forces evolutionary demographers to regard the adaptive i e fixed component of individual heterogeneity as larger than often predicted see steiner and tuljapurkar 2012 caswell 2014 snyder and ellner 2018 reintroducing life history trade offs into the models of evolutionary demography might thus show that luck is not the only driver of individual heterogeneity and provide a potential way out to the debate in the evolutionary demography community about the relative importance of adaptive and neutral i e dynamic heterogeneities indeed our theoretical model shows that it comes at no surprise that individual heterogeneity analyses accounting for different strategies fixed component of trade offs but not incorporating individual components of trade offs yield a disproportionate importance for the neutral component of heterogeneity compared to the expectations of empiricists steiner and tuljapurkar 2012 cam et al 2016 hamel et al 2018 from a methodological point of view this study also highlights the strong limitation of life history models which are only structured by age it is often argued that these models are ideal to study populations for which age is the main determinant of life history however this paradigm we have shown here has to be moved beyond firstly because trade offs are a key component of life history and that to be implemented a trade off requires at least two traits secondly because age is only the best predictor of vital rates as it already encompasses some consequences of lhtos a model where vital rates do not depend on age can seem to be strongly age driven when folded upon the cor using only one trait age partially incorporating by linkage the underlying trade offs and thus seemingly a life history determinant will generally provide appropriate results with respect to population dynamics and demography it will however generate poor analyses from an evolutionary demography viewpoint this can be readily ascertained by any empiricist when comparing the variance in reproductive success inferred by the leslie matrix generated from the life history table of her his studied organism with actual statistics from the field this discrepancy is only one in many consequences of interpreting age only structured models without accounting for all the effects of the simplification it could therefore be argued that the addition of a 2nd trait to an age structured model is as key to understand the life history of an organism from an evolutionary perspective than the addition of the 1st trait e g age or stage to a model with non overlapping generations is from a demographic viewpoint in general this will prompt us to revisit general results stemming from one trait analyses for instance charlesworth 1980 demonstrated that the age structure of population has little impact on their population genetics would that result hold when a 2nd trait implementing a constraint such as the individual costs is added to the age structured model acknowledgments this work benefited from the support of the chair modélisation mathématique et biodiversité of veolia ecole polytechnique mnhn fondation x in particular through a ph d grant to cfd c we thank ulrich steiner for helpful comments and suggestions we are greatly indebted to dmitrii o logofet for his time valuable help and advice we are very grateful to kate layton matthews hannah froy and aline m lee for their insightful comments on the manuscript appendix a different models for the different components of trade offs the rarity of implementation of trade offs into matrix projection models may be caused by the historical use of different families of models for population and individual mechanisms indeed mechanistic constraints working at the individual level are classically modeled via individual based models ibms also called agent based models because they allow tracking each specific being during every step of its life trajectory see for instance an ibm investigating cor in ungulates by proaktor et al 2008 thanks to their level of details such models can be considered as more precise and more flexible population projectors than matrices van imhoff and post 1998 however contrary to ppms that project the population as a whole they make it difficult to demonstrate the generalization of simulation results and to qualitatively ponder the weights of the various parameters that influence fitness caswell and john 1992 by contrast as their elementary elements are the vital rates for a given genotype engen et al 2009 csetenyi and logofet 1989 williamson 1959 ppms are the ideal tool to implement fixed genetic trade offs sensitivity analysis measuring the effects of vital rates on demographic fitness is at the core of evolutionary demography since caswell 1978 s matrix based sensitivity formula turning the argument around and considering that the state specific vital rates observed for a population are the manifestations of an evolutionary stable strategy ess parker and maynard smith 1990 some authors use ppms to infer the fixed trade offs between various fitness components this approach applies sensitivity analysis to ess positions and was initiated by a series of articles about optimal life histories schaffer 1974 law 1979 caswell 1982 it considers that the asymptotic growth rate dominant eigenvalue λ 1 simplified as λ taken as fitness is locally optimal thus implying that vital rates changes are constrained by their sensitivity values for example a positive change in fertility at age α f α would infer a negative change in survival at age β s β such that the ratio of changes i e the magnitude of the trade off equals the ratio of sensitivities λ f α λ s β see caswell 1982 van tienderen 1995 for detailed analysis this evolutionary demography approach known as optimality theory is very similar to the quantitative genetics method as demonstrated by charlesworth 1990 if a population is at ess then lande 1982 s equation becomes 0 g y and therefore the genetic constraints between vital rates in g stem directly from the selection gradient y corresponding to the vector of sensitivities of the asymptotic growth rate however powerful optimality theory has proven to be in developing life history theory such models infer but actually do not incorporate the fixed and genetic component of trade offs appendix b classical classification of lhtos the classical classification of trade offs see stearns 1992 roff 1993 is field based in that typology they are segregated into non evolutionary and evolutionary trade offs non evolutionary lhtos are themselves split between internal or physiological trade offs when the trade off stems from a constraint internal to the organism for instance generated by y shaped allocation mechanism because of finite resources and external or ecological lhtos when the constraint is caused by the environment evolutionary or genetic trade offs correspond to a constraint located at the genotypic level using stearns 1989 s genotypic intermediate phenotypic classical representation of lhtos this classification is however not absolutely segregating and not additive it is indeed easy to find examples of physiological trade offs that are also genetic actually most of the early evolutionary demography studies of physiological trade offs in the 70s e g schaffer 1974 are really about genetic lhtos as they do not study the physiological individual aspects of the constraint but how genes acting on the allocation of resources towards various fitness functions will evolve under various circumstances indeed in these articles two individuals with the same genotype or clones are deemed to exhibit the same life trajectories the trade off are called physiological there because that is where the constraint is supposedly located but genetic and ecological trade offs e g an antagonistic pleiotropy in genes generating a trade off between functions without any physiological inter mediation potentially with a behavioral mediation would yield the same results the location of the constraint as explained in the introduction is much less important for theoretical analyses of trade offs than the origin of the variance in the traits involved in the trade offs under the arising new additive and segregating typology see second paragraph of the introduction therefore such trade offs would be classified as genetic appendix c implementation of lhtos into mppms with empirical data the decomposition of lhtos into genetic and individual components hints at empirical determinations of their parameters as can be inferred from their relationship with the decomposition of individual heterogeneity into respectively fixed and dynamic components the methods developed to measure each component of heterogeneity from empirical data see review in hamel et al 2018 can indeed be extended to evaluate the strength of each component of lhtos at play the implementation can be sequenced as follows 1 the first step consists in splitting the population into subgroups with significantly different strategies i e positions on the genetic component of lhto for instance for the quality quantity trade off this process would yield subgroups with consistently more numerous and more fragile offspring than others embedding such a genetic component is done the same way as implementing different fixed heterogeneities in order to be able to analyze the population over long periods of time generation time or asymptotically knowledge of heredity of fixed traits is required plard et al 2018 however if only individual trajectories are of interest then heredity may be dispensed jenouvrier et al 2017 the decomposition into such fixed heterogeneity subgroups is classically done by joint mixture models hamel et al 2018 2 the second step consists for each of the strategies i e fixed heterogeneity groups identified in the first step to measure the modalities and the strength of the individual component of the trade off for instance for the quantity quality trade off this would consist for each lineage on the intraspecific quantity quality spectrum in gathering statistics on the effects of the number of early life offspring and their survival onto later life quantity and quality of juveniles this analysis of dynamic heterogeneity can be extracted from state dependent models an interesting illustration in the literature of analysis of the individual component of a lhto was performed by miller et al 2012 who quantify the effects of flowering or producing a fruit in year t τ onto growth survival and dormancy in year t of orchid orchis purpurea via generalized linear mixed effects models when the traits under consideration are continuous ecologists will resort to multitrait integral projection models themselves yielding mppms as described by ellner and rees 2006 and vindenes and langangen 2015 appendix d supplementary data supplementary data associated with

24911,it is increasingly recognized that incorporating life history trade offs into evolutionary demography models requires trade offs to be decomposed into fixed a k a genetic and individual a k a dynamic components this is fundamental in order to understand how trade offs are related to fixed and dynamic components of individual heterogeneities and generate variance in individual trajectories therefore embedding such trade offs into population projection matrices usually requires three categories a life history determining trait e g age or stage a fixed trait incorporating the genetic trade off and a dynamic trait modeling the individual component this has proved a complex exercise until the recent advent of multitrait population projection matrices mppms 1 1 mppm multitrait i e multi category population projection matrix recent developments of trait level analysis tla 2 2 tla trait level analysis a toolbox for mppms developed by coste et al 2017 tools for mppms now allow us to study the demographic and evolutionary consequences of each component of a life history trade off here we illustrate this by constructing and analyzing an evolutionary demography model that implements both dynamic and fixed components of the costs of reproduction the trade off between current early reproduction and future later fitness in particular we explain and describe the use of the tla to measure the effects of this trade off on individual fitness here we focus on the variance of lifetime reproductive success between models implementing the individual costs and asymptotically equivalent matrices from which they are absent this allows us to show that dynamic costs decrease that variance and more so for slow organisms therefore accounting for this component of the costs instead of classically focusing solely on fixed costs of reproduction is paramount in order to correctly assess the relative importance of the neutral and adaptive components of individual heterogeneity keywords trait level analysis life history theory life history trade offs multitrait population projection matrices evolutionary demography individual heterogeneity hyperstate matrix models 1 introduction trade offs are at the core of life history theory they occur when an increase in fitness due to a change in one trait is opposed by a decrease in fitness due to a concomitant change in the second trait roff and fairbairn 2007 p 433 these life history trade offs lhtos 3 3 lhto life history trade off without which nature would be filled with darwinian demons law 1979 are deemed ubiquitous they are studied by the various fields of evolutionary biology that make up life history theory and in particular three of them in quantitative genetics they are a major component of the g matrix lande 1982 physiologists focus on the mechanistic constraints mainly homeostatic yielding trade offs for instance because of a y shaped allocation of finite resources orton 1929 lack 1954 cody 1966 behavioral ecologists study environmentally mediated trade offs e g jessup and bohannan 2008 paradoxically however lhtos have rarely been implemented into evolutionary demography models this can be due to technical difficulties in doing so or because population and individual mechanisms are studied by different families of models while trade offs act at both these levels see appendix a however this shortcoming is most likely caused by demographers early realization that the classical classification of lhtos into physiological behavioral and genetic trade offs see appendix b lacks clarification pertaining to conceptual differences overlaps or equivalences between these three families as discussed in stearns 1992 roff 1993 to be implementable into evolutionary demography models trade offs require a novel typology that provides a proper demographic decomposition instead of a mechanistic classification we argue that this can be achieved by projecting onto the field of population projection matrices ppms the decomposition of individual heterogeneity into fixed and dynamic components devised by tuljapurkar steiner and orzack tuljapurkar et al 2009 steiner et al 2010 tuljapurkar and steiner 2010 itself leading to the decomposition of demographic traits a k a categories into static and dynamic classes vindenes and langangen 2015 instead of merely classifying trade offs according to the assumed locations of their constraint mechanisms this novel typology of trade offs decomposes lhtos into two components with respect to the means by which they affect phenotypic variance the first component is the fixed at birth component a k a genetic fixed or static it can be heritable because some of the phenotypic variance stems from genetic variance because of shared parent offspring environments or because of epigenetics in this paper for simplification we focus on fixed components of lhtos which are genetically fixed however the concepts and the model can be extended to incorporate other forms of fixed trait heritability when applied to trade offs such a genetic component of a lhto or simply genetic lhto generates a gradient of coexisting strategies in the population some lineages having a constantly better trait a and a worse trait b than others the second component is the individual component a k a dynamic individual lhtos encompass the mechanistic internal or external individual constraints that organisms have to deal with at every timestep of their lives when for instance allocating a limited amount of energy between two traits within a particular environment individual lhtos yield different possible realizations of each of the aforementioned strategies via their interaction with individual stochasticity in other words individuals of the same genetically determined life history strategy may experience different life history trajectories due to luck caswell 2009 tuljapurkar et al 2009 snyder and ellner 2018 therefore using the current nomenclature see steiner and tuljapurkar 2012 cam et al 2016 hamel et al 2018 we can write that the fixed component of trade offs generates adaptive heterogeneity and the individual component controls neutral heterogeneity the decomposition of a trade off into fixed and individual components is additive and can therefore be implemented into ppms we argue that such an implementation would benefit life history theory and evolutionary demography it would for instance enable measuring the evolutionary importance of the individual component of lhtos which is usually considered to have no evolutionary effects as their demographic consequences average out in large populations snyder and ellner 2018 here we implement both genetic and individual components of the costs of reproduction cor 4 4 cor costs of reproduction the most prominent of all trade offs according to stearns 1989 as it directly relates the two highest level components of fitness cor is the trade off between current early reproduction and future later fitness i e future later survival and reproduction the genetic component of such a trade off consists of the intraspecific gradient in strategies along the slow fast continuum slower lineages promote higher survival and therefore longevity at the cost of fertility compared to faster lineages the individual component of the cor reduces the vital rates of individuals as they exert reproductive efforts however since reproductive and survival events are subject to individual stochasticity i e to chance the realization of this trade off over the several timesteps of an individual life trajectory follows itself a stochastic process indeed two individuals sharing the same genetic fixed strategy may end up with very different trajectories as individual stochasticity in reproductive realizations generate deviations from the central strategy evolved by the lineage in order to incorporate both genetic and individual components of the cor into a ppm we build a three trait mppm indeed incorporating trade offs requires at least three traits the usual life history determining trait e g age size or stage a fixed trait embedding the genetic trade off and a dynamic trait incorporating the individual component the construction of such mppms has recently been streamlined roth and caswell 2016 coste et al 2017 moreover a new analytical tool the trait level analysis tla see coste et al 2017 now allows us to analyze the demographic and evolutionary importance of each trait in an mppm coste et al 2017 applied to a model implementing trade offs the tla makes it possible to measure the evolutionary consequences of the fixed and the individual components of a lhto here to investigate the cor we use a very common life history determining trait in the literature of demographic models age incorporating the individual component of the costs requires a trait that accounts for the accumulated reproductive efforts of individuals we use parity which tracks the number of offspring ever born in order to implement the fixed component of the costs we introduce a trait strategy that positions a lineage along the intraspecific slow fast continuum the parent s strategy being possibly inherited by its daughter we therefore construct an age parity strategy mppm projecting over time a population encountering both fixed and individual cor this three trait mppm is then analyzed via the tla in order to disentangle the evolutionary and demographic effects of each component the mppm is considered in a general form however the tools presented can readily be applied for a model built from empirical data see appendix c for illustrative and practical purposes we reduce the number of degrees of freedom to the fewest possible but such a model can also be built with numerous fixed and individual components this model is obviously too simple to be a proper population genetics model as this would also require the incorporation of new alleles generated via molecular mutations and of diploidy i e be a two sex model both limitations are common in extensions of projection models towards population genetics see e g de vries and caswell 2019 moreover this model cannot be considered a quantitative genetics one as this would require the ability to incorporate a continuous trait space however turning the mppm into an integral population model rees et al 2014 would allow the model to be extended from discrete to continuous trait values it is however not the aim of this article to develop a population or quantitative genetics model but to show how the addition of carefully chosen traits onto a demographic model can yield via the tla invaluable information about the evolutionary importance of the studied trade offs to perform such an analysis we focus on a key fitness measure lifetime reproductive success lrs considered as a random variable it measures the number of offspring produced by an individual in the population during its lifetime the expectation of lrs is the much used net reproductive rate r 0 the variance of lrs is denoted σ lrs 2 whereas the growth rate λ is often used as a genotype or population measure of fitness either as λ 1 the dominant eigenvalue for deterministic models or as λ s the stochastic growth rate for models incorporating environmental or demographic variance lrs is an individual measure many authors consider it a less relevant fitness measure than λ at the population level because it does not account for life pacing and reproductive rhythm nur 1984 murray 1992 giske et al 1993 indeed lrs loses track of chronological time a major shortcoming for models with overlapping generations however it has the advantage of being an individual measure readily aggregated at the population level this is not the case for λ despite efforts to conceive an individual growth rate however still difficult to fathom mcgraw and caswell 1997 initial results stemming from the application of tla to cor are already known see for instance the reducing effects of individual cor on selection gradients in coste et al 2017 but most still remain to be investigated here we focus on the effects of the individual component of costs on σ lrs 2 by comparing models implementing this trade off and asymptotically equivalent matrices from which it is absent via an operation called folding see coste et al 2017 we analyze how these effects depend on the position of species lineages on the slow fast continuum generated by genetic cor in particular we will show that individual cor decrease the variance in reproductive success and do so more strongly in slow organisms than fast ones we will also show that neglecting individual costs and focusing solely on fixed costs which is a common practice in evolutionary demography can yield to overestimating the neutral component of fixed heterogeneity at the expense of the adaptive one 2 materials and methods 2 1 theoretical mppm for both components of cor in order to disentangle the effects of individual and fixed components of costs the vital rates i e fertility and survival rates are decomposed into two independent components first the strategy is modeled by the zero parity vital rates the vital rates of individuals which have yet to reproduce a slower strategy will have lower zero parity fertility but higher zero parity survival rates than a faster one but both lineages may have the same fitness the same growth rate at the population level this spectrum of strategies constitutes the fixed component of cor second these zero parity vital rates are then linearly reduced with increased parity possibly down to zero this parity effect models the individual components of cor since the changes in parity value is a stochastic process that depends on reproductive history and demographic stochasticity thus the vital rates vr a p st vr being either a survival or fertility rate of an individual of age a parity p and strategy st are provided by the following formula 1 vr a p st 1 p β α 1 vr a 0 st parity effect zero parity vital rates individual comp of costs genetic comp of costs where α and β are the ages at first and last reproduction and for parsimony zero parity vital rates are independent of age a and therefore only dependent on strategy st as an individual of a fast strategy with large zero parity fertility rates is expected to encounter high reproductive success early in adult life it will have on average lower fertility rates late in life than an individual of a slower strategy that will have had fewer offspring at that point however it is possible in this model to consider an individual of a fast strategy but limited reproductive success because of bad luck that will have higher fertility rates late in life than a very and unexpectedly successful slow individual since the model incorporates several strategies we have to define a generation transmission parameter for the purpose of illustration we therefore incorporate parameter μ that represents the probability for an offspring to be of a different strategy than its parent when only two strategies are considered we have 0 μ 0 5 and this generates a scenario where differing for its parent s strategy can only mean switching from one to the other a quite unrealistic scenario from a population genetics standpoint in that case if μ 0 5 strategies are randomly distributed at birth i e the strategy is not heritable we denote l this generic formal age parity strategy mppm in expression 2 we illustrate a particular l for an organism with maximum age ω 3 years age at first reproduction α 2 years and age at last reproduction β 3 years with a slow lineage left half of the matrix in blue colours are added for clarity in the online version with zero parity vital rates s and f and a fast lineage right half of the matrix in red with zero parity vital rates s and f with s s and f f parity can be 0 or 1 there are actually two possible fertility events in every life trajectory but here individuals of parity 2 have an abundance of zero as they have reached maximum lifespan and are therefore not accounted for having parity of 1 divides individual fertility by a factor of 2 compared to having a parity of 0 in an mppm the state of an individual depends on its position according to several trait category axes this state of an individual or individual state corresponds to the i state of metz and diekmann 1986 and from now on we shall refer to it simply as state these states form a space the space of states or state space which is a product space the order in which traits are nested in the space of states is crucial to its construction and analysis its knowledge is required in order to generate the trait structure as per coste et al 2017 here the space of states is three dimensional and trait age is nested into trait parity and both into trait strategy formally it means that the i th element of abundance vector n which matrix l projects over time represents the abundances of individuals of age a parity p and strategy st for which a ω p ω par st i with par the number of parity classes which can be calculated as par min β α 2 ω α 1 each a p st combination corresponds to one and only one position 1 i ω par 2 in n and each of these 1 i ω par 2 indices corresponds to one and only one a p st triplet here this means that the state corresponding to trait triplet a p st will occupy position a 3 p 6 st in the space of individual states we equate st 0 with the slow strategy and st 1 with the fast one for instance this means that individuals of age 2 parity 0 and fast strategy will occupy position 8 in n abundance vector n is of length ω par 2 i e here 3 2 2 12 and l of size 12 12 vital rates for parities of 1 are represented in lighter shades than the zero parity rates such that l can be written as 2 2 2 folding the age parity strategy mppm the tla of an mppm aims at understanding the demographic and evolutionary importance of traits for the dynamics of a population coste et al 2017 it is the trait counterpart of the classical sensitivity elasticity analysis to matrix entries goodman 1971 caswell 1978 de kroon et al 1986 in order to measure the sensitivity of fitness values or any other asymptotic measure to traits the tla asks how these values are affected by the folding of the matrix over one or several of its categories a k a traits folding as detailed by coste et al 2017 consists in merging states i e combinations of traits or matrix entries sharing the same values for the traits to be folded upon in a manner that preserves the asymptotic flows of individuals between those states simply put ergodic flow preserving merging of matrix entries consists in summing the outgoing transitions and averaging the incoming ones weighted by asymptotic abundances this approach has been theorized by enright et al 1995 hooley 2000 and salguero gómez and plotkin 2010 folding at the core of the tla extends the operation of efp merging from states to traits in the case of mppm l incorporating the traits parity and strategy successive foldings over these traits provide information on the respective consequences of the individual and genetic components of cor we hereafter denote l age parity fold l age strategy fold and l age fold the matrix l respectively folded over strategy over parity and over both matrix l age fold is also called the reference leslie matrix and its comparison with l provides information regarding the evolutionary importance of both individual and genetic components of the cor as an illustration of the folding mechanism from the formal 3 year model described above in expression 2 with α 2 β 3 and 2 strategies we draw a specific model l 1 with two iso fitness genotypes of asymptotic growth rate λ r 0 1 we denote λ here the dominant eigenvalue of the deterministic matrix in this case vital rates are f 0 95 and s 0 7541 for the fast strategy and f 0 7013 and s 0 9 for the slow strategy reproduction is considered as a random process constituted of bernoulli independent trials one offspring maximum per timestep the transmission parameter is μ 0 25 we get all transition probabilities between individual states are rounded off to the nearest ten thousandth 3 its normalized right eigenvector w l 1 19 87 15 00 0 57 0 0 10 75 19 87 17 87 4 78 0 0 11 29 t where each entry is rounded off to the nearest hundredth can be written in 3 dimensional form as from the latter we can construct the weight matrices wght and from the characteristics of the traits to be folded upon the trait structure one can compute the block folding permutation matrices p bf which together generate the folding matrices as per eq 4 in coste et al 2017 this yields l 1 age strategy fold i e l 1 folded over trait parity a population model where both fixed and individual components of the costs were initially accounted for but where individual costs are no longer implemented 4 calculation wise in the particular case of this illustration the fertility rate for 3 year old slow individuals in l 1 age strategy fold 0 3741 can be easily obtained by averaging the corresponding fertility rates in l 1 0 7125 for the individuals of parity 0 and 0 3563 for the individuals of parity 1 with weights corresponding to the relative abundances of these two states 0 57 0 57 10 75 for the individuals of parity 0 and 10 75 0 57 10 75 for the individuals of parity 1 matrix l 1 age fold is the reference leslie matrix obtained by folding l 1 over the parity and strategy traits a ppm where cor are accounted for but not implemented 5 l 1 age fold 0 8147 0 4733 0 8271 0 8335 vital rates are an input of the initial matrix l 1 embedding cor as for classical matrix models however they are an output of the folded models for these folded models the induced vital rates can be gathered directly or computed from the entries of the matrices in our illustration vital rates for the reference leslie matrix l 1 age fold are readily readable in eq 5 on the first line fertility rates and the subdiagonal survival rates each of the two block matrices one for each strategy of l age strategy fold can also be treated as such eq 4 with regards to l age parity fold calculations are similar fertilities are to be found on the first line and the other entries sum up column wise to the survival rates note however that the interpretation of l age parity fold and for that matter of any multitrait model folded over one of its dynamic trait is to be treated with care see supplementary material s 1 by construction λ is preserved by folding but what about r 0 in the general case this is not true see supplementary material s 2 in the particular case of mppms with trait age however r 0 is preserved by folding proof in supplementary material s 3 note that as ppms project populations over time it is always possible to incorporate age as a trait therefore as for λ the effects of lhtos on r 0 will be measured by their consequences on the higher moments of lrs and chiefly its variance σ lrs 2 2 3 variance in reproductive success for mppms for mppms with both dynamic and fixed traits the calculation of σ lrs 2 requires the use of a tool for which the fertility processes are not formalized as vectors of moments per input state i but as a matrix containing the different moments of fertility for an individual surviving from state i to state j a markov chain with rewards mcwr is such a tool where the reward matrix can implement the various moments of f the fertility stochastic process as a function of both ends of an i j transition we will thus use mcwrs to compute variance σ lrs 2 for the age parity strategy mppm l to describe the mcwr mathematical framework introduced by howard 1960 and hatori 1966 we will use the approach of caswell 2011 who was the first to have applied this tool to demography the mcwr framework requires two instruments first t which is t of size q q where q is the number of states the usual survival transition matrix upon which absorbing state death is explicitly added in the q 1 th position of the matrix t t 0 m 1 m is the vector of mortality rates i e m 1 1 t where 1 denotes the q dimensional vector of ones matrix t is a stochastic matrix columns sum to 1 that fully describes the markov chain of all possible survival trajectories that any individual in the population can follow before being absorbed by death second the family of reward matrices rw k where rw k ij is the k th moment of the random variable of the reward i e here the birth of 1 offspring for an individual transitioning from state j to state i whenever no trade off involving fertility is involved matrices rw k have rank 1 with all lines equal to the fertility rate vector in l however current reproductive success does not only depend on the state i a p st of the individual but also on the state j it is transitioning toward in detail if j a 1 p 1 st then reproduction is being successful as parity is increased by one unit and thus its expectation is rw j i 1 1 if j a 1 p st the individual survives but does not reproduce at that timestep then rw j i 1 0 finally if j death the individual dies at the end of the period then because fertility and survival processes are independent of their respective realizations they are not independent per se as their probability rates depend on their states which are equal rw death i 1 f i this completes the construction of the reward matrix rw 1 it is therefore a zero matrix with the exception of 0 its lower sub diagonal made of 1 s and its bottom row corresponding to fertility rates because the reproductive rewards are the outcome of bernoulli independent trials either 0 or 1 offspring in our particular illustration reward matrices for any moment rw k are equal to the reward matrix of means rw 1 let ρ k be the vector of the k th moment of lrs indexed on individuals starting states these are calculated as the convergence of backwards accumulation of remaining rewards following individuals from death where no remaining reward remains to birth or age a 1 from caswell et al 2011 we draw the following convergence equations for the first two moments 6 ρ 1 lim t ρ 1 t with ρ 1 t 1 t rw 1 1 t ρ 1 t 7 ρ 2 lim t ρ 2 t with ρ 2 t 1 t rw 2 1 2 t rw 1 ρ 1 t t ρ 2 t and with initial conditions ρ 1 0 ρ 2 0 0 is the hadamard or elementwise product let us now reduce all lrs moments ρ k to states of age a 1 and thus p 0 i e to the offspring states then ρ 1 and ρ 2 are of size the number of classes of trait strategy then the vectors of expectancy and of variance of lrs for each offspring class are 8 e lrs ρ 1 9 σ lrs 2 ρ 2 ρ 1 ρ 1 3 results effects of individual costs on σ lrs 2 we aim at measuring some of the effects of the cor on σ lrs 2 the variance in lifetime reproductive success specifically we focus on comparing the variance of lrs between models implementing the individual costs and asymptotically equivalent matrices from which they are absent i e folded over parity to be able to provide such results we have constructed mppms that incorporate the individual and or the genetic component s of cor via the traits parity and strategy in the following sections we first investigate the overall effect of individual costs on σ lrs 2 second we compare the strength of this effect along the gradient of genetic costs to determine whether the position of a lineage on the slow fast continuum has an effect on the strength of individual costs on individual fitness finally we investigate the consequences of these results for the relative importance of adaptive and neutral components of individual heterogeneity 3 1 individual costs reduce the variance in lifetime reproductive success in supplementary material section s 4 we formally demonstrate eq 18 that individual cor reduce σ lrs 2 indeed we show that for l an age parity mppm embedding individual costs and l age fold denoted l in this section and the next with a as for the rest of the parameters related to the folded model its folded daughter from which individual cor are absent we have 10 σ lrs 2 l σ lrs 2 l this result is achieved by focusing on the parity distributions at demographic stable state of the successive age classes in both models in other words the individual costs buffer individual stochasticity here we illustrate this by analyzing an age parity strategy mppm incorporating individual costs for multiple strategies that do not interact i e μ 0 the different strategies can be seen as corresponding to different populations we therefore performed our investigation on multiple age parity mppms each corresponding to a specific strategy and each incorporating individual cor to better understand the effects of the individual costs on σ lrs 2 we plot in fig 1 the difference in variance for a constructed age parity matrix l with the individual costs and its folded reference leslie matrix l l age fold without the costs for a range of zero parity fertility and survival rates more precisely fig 1a depicts the difference in variance σ lrs 2 l σ lrs 2 l and fig 1b the difference in coefficient of variation σ lrs 2 r 0 l σ lrs 2 r 0 l for reference we also plot σ lrs 2 l in fig 1c and the iso fitness curves for both λ and r 0 in fig 1d the first observation is that individual cor indeed reduce variance fig 1a and coefficient of variation fig 1b of lrs the second observation is that the effects of cor on σ lrs 2 fig 1a follow the general shape of σ lrs 2 itself fig 1c the shape of σ lrs 2 as a function of zero parity rates f and s reveals that it results from the combined effects of three parameters first the variance in fertility rates at each age var f a f a 1 f a which is the engine of the variance in lrs and confers to the latter the x 1 x shape of the former along the zero parity fertility rate axis the importance of var f a for late ages however requires survival and thus the increase in σ lrs 2 as survival increases at the same time as age increases we have on average a decrease in f a because of the costs therefore even very high zero parity fertility rates conferring no variance in f a at early ages will generate variance at late ages hence the asymmetrical x 1 x shape at high survival rates across fertility rates finally survival does not only act as a promoter of variance in fertility but as a stochastic process itself of variance s i 1 s i which explains the decrease in variance as survival reaches its maximum levels these last two effects explain the general location in this model of the maximum σ lrs 2 reached by organisms with zero parity survival fertility coordinates of s 0 94 f 0 64 this general shape namely the x 1 x pattern on zero parity fertility axis and general increase with survival is preserved when switching from σ lrs 2 l fig 1c to σ lrs 2 l σ lrs 2 l fig 1a this is because this difference is a linear function of variance itself as shown in eq 17 supplementary material s 4 however this equation shows the difference in variance to also linearly depend on survival and fertility this explains why the difference in variance between models with and without the costs fig 1a increases with survival even at high survival rates and is flat at very low survival rates these patterns are preserved when correcting for r 0 i e for high fertility and survival rates as can be observed from the differential in the coefficient of variation fig 1b logically both the exponential increase with survival and the asymmetrical effect for high fertility disappear these observations demonstrate that even though very short lived or semelparous organisms i e with s 0 exhibit variance in reproductive success fig 1c the individual cor do not affect them fig 1a and 1 b and that the effects of the costs will increase with iteroparity longevity let us now investigate further the various effects of individual cor on iso fitness organisms across the slow fast continuum 3 2 effects of individual cor for iso fitness organisms across the slow fast continuum from an evolutionary life history perspective comparing the life histories of organisms with very different fitness makes little sense therefore from the statistics plotted in fig 1 for all possible zero parity vital rates we extract the combinations that are iso fitness more precisely in fig 2 we represent for each possible zero parity fertility rate the corresponding zero parity survival rate for a fitness of λ r 0 1 red curve right y axis for each such pair of coordinates we extract the variances in lrs for the models with and without the costs grey curves left y axis and their difference green curve left y axis this establishes for the particular case of organisms that are iso fitness the general conclusions drawn above here all organisms have stationary growth rate and therefore r 0 is worth unity the variance in reproductive success stems from both variance in fertility and survival and is therefore maximal for intermediary values of f and s however survival is also required to promote late fertility and this pushes s max higher and therefore f max lower than the point of equal coordinates f 0 54 s 0 54 as expected because of the individual cor this is less true for l for which s max is lower and therefore f max higher than for l to the contrary the differential in variances between the two models green curve is maximal for the maximum possible survival rate s 1 and its related zero parity fertility rate f 0 22 in other words this result shows that whilst the effect of individual stochasticity is not a monotonous function of the pace of organisms as measured by their position on the slow fast continuum stearns 1983 gaillard et al 1989 the effects of individual cor on such individual stochasticity decrease with pace and are maximum for slow organisms 3 3 combining effects of genetic and individual costs on σ lrs 2 in supplementary material s 5 we demonstrate that individual costs and fixed heterogeneity caused e g by genetic costs act independently and additively on σ lrs 2 in particular the fixed heterogeneity component of the variance in lifetime reproductive success is unaffected by individual costs in other words this formally demonstrates the intuitive perception that individual costs act solely on the dynamic heterogeneity component of individual fitness variance we also show there that the individual costs increase the relative importance of the fixed aka adaptive heterogeneity component of σ lrs 2 as it remains constant whilst the dynamic aka neutral component of heterogeneity is reduced we illustrate this by providing σ lrs 2 and its decomposition for a numerical application of l expression 2 we call l 2 the mppm for which age at first reproduction is α 1 maximum age ω 15 the zero parity vital rates for the fast genotype f 0 35 and s 0 6 and for the slow genotype f 0 3 and s 0 8 the decomposition of variance σ lrs 2 for l 2 and l 2 parity fold its folded version over parity from which individual costs are absent yields σ lrs 2 l 2 parity fold 1 2040 σ lrs 2 dyn l 2 parity fold 0 0362 σ lrs 2 fix l 2 parity fold σ lrs 2 l 2 1 0439 σ lrs 2 dyn l 2 0 0362 σ lrs 2 fix l 2 we observe that as expected the fixed component of the variance decomposition i e the adaptive heterogeneity component is small compared to the dynamic i e neutral component here σ lrs 2 dyn represents 96 6 of σ lrs 2 as theoretically calculated also the fixed component of the variance decomposition is preserved by folding over parity i e when considering individual costs or not finally and most importantly we observe that the implementation of individual cor increases the relative value of the adaptive component by 14 8 the ratio of 0 0362 1 204 0 0362 to 0 0362 1 0439 0 0362 incorporating the individual components of the multiple lhtos at play in an organism will increase this value further this allows us to contemplate the adaptive component of individual heterogeneity as a stronger factor than sometimes anticipated see steiner and tuljapurkar 2012 caswell 2014 cam et al 2016 snyder and ellner 2018 hamel et al 2018 4 discussion in this article we provide the steps allowing an ecologist to implement the dynamic and fixed components of a life history trade offs lhtos into a mppm and to analyze their effects on the evolutionary dynamics of a population specifically we focus on the two components individual and genetic of the costs of reproduction cor and their effects on the variance in lifetime reproductive success σ lrs 2 the random variable lrs is a commonly used measure of individual fitness and its expectation is the ubiquitous r 0 e lrs the genetic fixed component of cor is caused by intra population variance in pleiotropic genes acting on survival and fertility in other words it generates a gradient of strategies along the intra population slow fast continuum stearns 1983 gaillard et al 1989 the individual dynamic component of cor is related to the variance in individual trajectories caused by individual stochasticity individuals of the same strategy may indeed exhibit different life trajectories this is of course because of the randomness in vital rates but also because the latter are affected with stochasticity by the individual costs i e by the fact that past reproductive realizations negatively affect vital rates this general decomposition of lhtos into genetic fixed and individual dynamic components is important for evolutionary demography as it is additive and can therefore be integrated into population projection matrices ppms following this decomposition we demonstrate how to generate a multitrait population projection matrix mppm coste et al 2017 incorporating these two components for the cor the genetic costs are embedded via a fixed trait that positions the lineage s strategy slow or fast along the slow fast continuum the individual costs are implemented via dynamic trait parity the number of offspring ever born that tracks individual reproductive success by reducing the mean vital rates of individuals that have been successful so far in their life trajectory individual costs control dynamic heterogeneity the age parity strategy mppm l is then analyzed via a trait level analysis tla coste et al 2017 it consists in this case in comparing the properties of the full model l with asymptotically equivalent folded versions of l from which traits parity and or strategy are absent and therefore where the related dynamic and or fixed cor are also concealed from this analysis we formally demonstrate that individual cor have a cushioning effect on the variance of reproductive success eq 10 we then investigate how the strategy of a lineage its position on the genetic cor influences this buffering effect we show that the individual costs have a stronger impact on the variance in reproductive success of long lived organisms than on that of slow lived organisms of the same fitness for very short lived ones thus almost semelparous the individual costs have almost no demographic buffering effect finally as it reduces the variance in reproductive success individual costs have a buffering effect on individual heterogeneity we show in this respect that individual cor only affect the dynamic component of σ lrs 2 therefore the dynamic component of the costs which is often discarded to the benefit of its genetic fixed counterpart especially in comparative studies acts solely on the neutral component of individual heterogeneity the key result in this paper namely the buffering effect of individual cor on the dynamic component of the variance in reproductive success has far reaching consequences for evolutionary demography and most importantly for the measurement of the relative contributions of the fixed and dynamic component of individual heterogeneity via integral projection models or ppms it implies that when ecologists ignore the individual components of the multiple lhtos at play in an organism and only implements the fixed or genetic components they compute a correct measure for the fixed component of heterogeneity but overestimate the dynamic component potentially to a large degree if the organism is subject to many trade offs this forces evolutionary demographers to regard the adaptive i e fixed component of individual heterogeneity as larger than often predicted see steiner and tuljapurkar 2012 caswell 2014 snyder and ellner 2018 reintroducing life history trade offs into the models of evolutionary demography might thus show that luck is not the only driver of individual heterogeneity and provide a potential way out to the debate in the evolutionary demography community about the relative importance of adaptive and neutral i e dynamic heterogeneities indeed our theoretical model shows that it comes at no surprise that individual heterogeneity analyses accounting for different strategies fixed component of trade offs but not incorporating individual components of trade offs yield a disproportionate importance for the neutral component of heterogeneity compared to the expectations of empiricists steiner and tuljapurkar 2012 cam et al 2016 hamel et al 2018 from a methodological point of view this study also highlights the strong limitation of life history models which are only structured by age it is often argued that these models are ideal to study populations for which age is the main determinant of life history however this paradigm we have shown here has to be moved beyond firstly because trade offs are a key component of life history and that to be implemented a trade off requires at least two traits secondly because age is only the best predictor of vital rates as it already encompasses some consequences of lhtos a model where vital rates do not depend on age can seem to be strongly age driven when folded upon the cor using only one trait age partially incorporating by linkage the underlying trade offs and thus seemingly a life history determinant will generally provide appropriate results with respect to population dynamics and demography it will however generate poor analyses from an evolutionary demography viewpoint this can be readily ascertained by any empiricist when comparing the variance in reproductive success inferred by the leslie matrix generated from the life history table of her his studied organism with actual statistics from the field this discrepancy is only one in many consequences of interpreting age only structured models without accounting for all the effects of the simplification it could therefore be argued that the addition of a 2nd trait to an age structured model is as key to understand the life history of an organism from an evolutionary perspective than the addition of the 1st trait e g age or stage to a model with non overlapping generations is from a demographic viewpoint in general this will prompt us to revisit general results stemming from one trait analyses for instance charlesworth 1980 demonstrated that the age structure of population has little impact on their population genetics would that result hold when a 2nd trait implementing a constraint such as the individual costs is added to the age structured model acknowledgments this work benefited from the support of the chair modélisation mathématique et biodiversité of veolia ecole polytechnique mnhn fondation x in particular through a ph d grant to cfd c we thank ulrich steiner for helpful comments and suggestions we are greatly indebted to dmitrii o logofet for his time valuable help and advice we are very grateful to kate layton matthews hannah froy and aline m lee for their insightful comments on the manuscript appendix a different models for the different components of trade offs the rarity of implementation of trade offs into matrix projection models may be caused by the historical use of different families of models for population and individual mechanisms indeed mechanistic constraints working at the individual level are classically modeled via individual based models ibms also called agent based models because they allow tracking each specific being during every step of its life trajectory see for instance an ibm investigating cor in ungulates by proaktor et al 2008 thanks to their level of details such models can be considered as more precise and more flexible population projectors than matrices van imhoff and post 1998 however contrary to ppms that project the population as a whole they make it difficult to demonstrate the generalization of simulation results and to qualitatively ponder the weights of the various parameters that influence fitness caswell and john 1992 by contrast as their elementary elements are the vital rates for a given genotype engen et al 2009 csetenyi and logofet 1989 williamson 1959 ppms are the ideal tool to implement fixed genetic trade offs sensitivity analysis measuring the effects of vital rates on demographic fitness is at the core of evolutionary demography since caswell 1978 s matrix based sensitivity formula turning the argument around and considering that the state specific vital rates observed for a population are the manifestations of an evolutionary stable strategy ess parker and maynard smith 1990 some authors use ppms to infer the fixed trade offs between various fitness components this approach applies sensitivity analysis to ess positions and was initiated by a series of articles about optimal life histories schaffer 1974 law 1979 caswell 1982 it considers that the asymptotic growth rate dominant eigenvalue λ 1 simplified as λ taken as fitness is locally optimal thus implying that vital rates changes are constrained by their sensitivity values for example a positive change in fertility at age α f α would infer a negative change in survival at age β s β such that the ratio of changes i e the magnitude of the trade off equals the ratio of sensitivities λ f α λ s β see caswell 1982 van tienderen 1995 for detailed analysis this evolutionary demography approach known as optimality theory is very similar to the quantitative genetics method as demonstrated by charlesworth 1990 if a population is at ess then lande 1982 s equation becomes 0 g y and therefore the genetic constraints between vital rates in g stem directly from the selection gradient y corresponding to the vector of sensitivities of the asymptotic growth rate however powerful optimality theory has proven to be in developing life history theory such models infer but actually do not incorporate the fixed and genetic component of trade offs appendix b classical classification of lhtos the classical classification of trade offs see stearns 1992 roff 1993 is field based in that typology they are segregated into non evolutionary and evolutionary trade offs non evolutionary lhtos are themselves split between internal or physiological trade offs when the trade off stems from a constraint internal to the organism for instance generated by y shaped allocation mechanism because of finite resources and external or ecological lhtos when the constraint is caused by the environment evolutionary or genetic trade offs correspond to a constraint located at the genotypic level using stearns 1989 s genotypic intermediate phenotypic classical representation of lhtos this classification is however not absolutely segregating and not additive it is indeed easy to find examples of physiological trade offs that are also genetic actually most of the early evolutionary demography studies of physiological trade offs in the 70s e g schaffer 1974 are really about genetic lhtos as they do not study the physiological individual aspects of the constraint but how genes acting on the allocation of resources towards various fitness functions will evolve under various circumstances indeed in these articles two individuals with the same genotype or clones are deemed to exhibit the same life trajectories the trade off are called physiological there because that is where the constraint is supposedly located but genetic and ecological trade offs e g an antagonistic pleiotropy in genes generating a trade off between functions without any physiological inter mediation potentially with a behavioral mediation would yield the same results the location of the constraint as explained in the introduction is much less important for theoretical analyses of trade offs than the origin of the variance in the traits involved in the trade offs under the arising new additive and segregating typology see second paragraph of the introduction therefore such trade offs would be classified as genetic appendix c implementation of lhtos into mppms with empirical data the decomposition of lhtos into genetic and individual components hints at empirical determinations of their parameters as can be inferred from their relationship with the decomposition of individual heterogeneity into respectively fixed and dynamic components the methods developed to measure each component of heterogeneity from empirical data see review in hamel et al 2018 can indeed be extended to evaluate the strength of each component of lhtos at play the implementation can be sequenced as follows 1 the first step consists in splitting the population into subgroups with significantly different strategies i e positions on the genetic component of lhto for instance for the quality quantity trade off this process would yield subgroups with consistently more numerous and more fragile offspring than others embedding such a genetic component is done the same way as implementing different fixed heterogeneities in order to be able to analyze the population over long periods of time generation time or asymptotically knowledge of heredity of fixed traits is required plard et al 2018 however if only individual trajectories are of interest then heredity may be dispensed jenouvrier et al 2017 the decomposition into such fixed heterogeneity subgroups is classically done by joint mixture models hamel et al 2018 2 the second step consists for each of the strategies i e fixed heterogeneity groups identified in the first step to measure the modalities and the strength of the individual component of the trade off for instance for the quantity quality trade off this would consist for each lineage on the intraspecific quantity quality spectrum in gathering statistics on the effects of the number of early life offspring and their survival onto later life quantity and quality of juveniles this analysis of dynamic heterogeneity can be extracted from state dependent models an interesting illustration in the literature of analysis of the individual component of a lhto was performed by miller et al 2012 who quantify the effects of flowering or producing a fruit in year t τ onto growth survival and dormancy in year t of orchid orchis purpurea via generalized linear mixed effects models when the traits under consideration are continuous ecologists will resort to multitrait integral projection models themselves yielding mppms as described by ellner and rees 2006 and vindenes and langangen 2015 appendix d supplementary data supplementary data associated with

24912,macroalgal blooms in eutrophic coastal waters around the globe constitute a rising issue for ecosystems and economic activities sometimes leading to anoxic events a better understanding of its growth dynamics is necessary to develop mitigation strategies and inform policies on nutrient runoff management the development of a dynamic energy budget deb model for the sea lettuce ulva lactuca provides a generic mechanistic description of energy and matter fluxes within the macroalgae and between macroalgae and the environment forcing variables consist of seawater temperature light intensity and seawater concentrations of dissolved carbon and nitrogen the model includes a self shading module for light reduction under heavy biomass and simulation outputs consist of but are not limited to total algae biomass nutrient uptake carbon and nitrogen photosynthetic rate and state of nutrient reserve model parameters were estimated using data sets from the literature and laboratory experiments then validated using an independent field study in two estuaries with contrasting nutrient loads that feed into malpeque bay pei canada the validation step yielded accurate temporal predictions of sea lettuce biomass in both of these estuaries these results indicate that the present mechanistic modelling approach for predicting sea lettuce dynamics captures salient patterns along a spectrum of nutrient loading and could therefore be of use for managing across diverse ecological conditions which is particularly relevant for a widespread species like ulva lactuca keywords sea lettuce nutrients photosynthesis eutrophication estuary synthesizing units 1 introduction blooms of opportunistic macroalgae are a growing concern in the context of climate change and coastal eutrophication blooms of sea lettuce ulva spp are a prime example of one of the consequences of the increase of nutrient inputs from land all around the world smetacek and zingone 2013 on prince edward island pei eastern canada where 40 of the land is cleared for agricultural use nutrient runoff is the root cause of eutrophication and subsequent sea lettuce blooms in near shore marine areas crane and ramsay 2012 leading to recurrent anoxia events coffin et al 2018a the green macroalga ulva lactuca is naturally found in many bays and estuaries often free floating in the water column and sometimes producing very dense mats at the water s surface despite the increase in nitrogen loads flora shifts from a greater proportion of phytoplankton to macroalgae may be more common in eutrophic waters wang et al 2012 wallace and gobler 2015 a recent study by filgueira et al 2015 suggested that a reduction in phytoplankton biomass from competition for nutrients with the sea lettuce and consumption by farmed and natural mollusks may limit the capacity of new aquafarms in some areas emphasizing the necessity to include opportunistic macroalgae in models aiming at quantifying ecosystem dynamics modelling studies of primary producers in aquatic environments are mostly restricted to unicellular microalgae i e phytoplankton the emerging interest in macroalgae in light of the prevalence of eutrophication and their importance as a resource has recently prompted modelling studies hadley et al 2015 seghetta et al 2016 in order to assess the threat they may represent for coastal ecosystems health and some industries e g fish and shellfish aquaculture tourism these models can take different forms ranging from empirical models using simple analytic formulae duarte and ferreira 1997 huisman et al 2002 to more complex numerical models broch and slagstad 2012 and generally all consider the two crucial controls of algal growth light and nutrients empirically based approaches play an important role in algae modelling de los santos et al 2009 anderson et al 2010 mcgillicuddy 2010 hadley et al 2015 providing a link between conceptual and dynamic modelling such models can be coupled to other modules in box models formalizing the interactions between the environment and organisms in more mechanistic frameworks which can yield insights into physiological processes ren et al 2012 and systemic properties and behavior roiha et al 2010 perrot et al 2014 this may lead to a better understanding of ecosystem dynamics and functioning however empirical approaches lack predictive capacity and generalization to be applied to other species locations and times one framework the dynamic energy budget deb theory may address this weakness deb provides a comprehensive description of the metabolic organization of individuals that allows the modelling of energy and mass fluxes between the environment and the organism and within the organism kooijman 2010 deb theory is generalist as

phytoplankton zooplankton interaction poggiale et al 2010 one study on macroalgae by broch and slagstad 2012 integrated some concepts of the deb theory and successfully predicted the seasonal growth and composition of kelp further development of this type of modelling could be ideal to accurately assess and quantify the potential impact of opportunistic macroalgae on complex ecosystems such as coastal bays and estuaries in this paper we present the first comprehensive deb model for a macroalgal species we describe the development of the model for the sea lettuce ulva lactuca its calibration using literature and experimental data and its application to a field study conducted in malpeque bay pei canada this work represents an important advancement for the modelling of coastal ecosystems it allows the quantification of the potential impact of sea lettuce on the nutrient dynamics in such complex and ever changing systems 2 material and methods 2 1 the ulva deb model 2 1 1 general concepts the deb theory is governed by assumptions allowing a sound description of the metabolic organization in compatibility with physics and evolutionary laws the strong homeostasis hypothesis kooijman 2010 is a core assumption in deb theory stating that the structure v and the reserve s e do not change in chemical composition and thermodynamic properties a stable internal chemical composition means that organisms have a higher control over their own metabolism because the rate of chemical reactions depends on the chemical composition of the surrounding environment sousa et al 2008 when assimilation pathways are essentially independent such as in algae and other autotrophs the constant chemical composition of reserves can only be ensured if there are different reserves for each assimilation pathway kooijman 2010 we considered here two substrates carbon and nitrogen each with a corresponding assimilation pathway and reserve other nutrients such as phosphorus could be added with similar dynamics as that of nitrogen but many studies showed that nitrogen prevails as the main limiting substrate for sea lettuce teichberg et al 2010 and references within synthesizing units sus defined as conceptual enzymes in deb theory kooijman 2010 were used to perform all transformations of one or several substrate molecules into one or several product molecules these mechanistic transformations were defined at the individual level for nutrient uptake as it is the appropriate level of organization for this process poggiale et al 2010 these uptake formulations were then included in a deb population model which dynamics were represented by three state variables structure m v molv nitrogen reserve density m e n m e n m v moln molv 1 and carbon reserve density m e c m e c m v molc molv 1 with m e c and m e n the respective mass of carbon and nitrogen reserves nutrients are first transformed into reserves through dedicated assimilation sus fig 1 each reserve is mobilized independently and first allocated to a dedicated maintenance su finally the remaining reserve fluxes are combined in a single growth su to produce structure because the dynamics of each reserve can be different the growth su can receive more of one type of substrate this results in the rejection of a certain quantity of this substrate a fraction of which is fed back to its reserve while the other is excreted when mobilized reserves are not sufficient to cover maintenance costs structural mass is broken down to fulfill the required maintenance cost sea lettuce thalli are constituted of two cell layers separated by an intercellular volume which can be considered negligible as a results surface area and volume vary linearly which qualifies sea lettuce as a v1 morph as specified in the deb terminology i e organisms with a surface area proportional to volume this simplifies all model equations as compared to models for isomorphs in the life cycle of sea lettuce both sexual and asexual reproduction occurs due to a lack of data on these mechanisms and for simplicity the model in its current form does not account for reproductive processes we now detail the equations of the model which is based on the models previously developed for microalgae by papadakis et al 2005 lorena et al 2010 and more recently livanou et al 2019 2 1 2 assimilation of nutrients the different forms of nitrogen taken up from the environment by macroalgae primarily consist of nitrate ammonium urea and amino acids tyler et al 2005 giordano and raven 2014 however nitrate is the major source kennison et al 2011 nitrogen uptake is operated by active transporter proteins in the cell membrane and is usually transformed to be assimilated into reserve as glutamate although it may also be temporarily stored as nitrate amino acids or proteins prior to assimilation giordano and raven 2014 the incorporation of nitrogen into reserve is described in the model by a michaelis menten relationship 1 j e n a j e n a m n n k n with j e n a m the maximum volume specific assimilation rate in moln molv 1 h 1 n the concentration of dissolved nitrogen in the environment in moln l 1 and kn the half saturation constant in moln l 1 throughout this study rates such as j e n a m are expressed per c mol of structure the assimilation of carbon through photosynthesis is more complex requiring two substrates photons and co2 three photosynthetic sus are used to model the different steps of photosynthesis fig 1 a first su in the chloroplasts captures the photon flux through the photosystems ps and utilizes this energy to produce nadph this represents the light dependent reaction of photosynthesis which also produces atp a second su handles the uptake of co2 and a third su utilizes the products of the first two to assimilate carbon as carbohydrates into the reserve this represents the calvin benson cycle as in papadakis et al 2005 we considered simple dynamics for the capture of photons denoted γ by the first photosynthetic su with no photorespiration the relaxation rate of products by the first photosynthetic su at steady state is denoted jl in molγ molv 1 h 1 and is given by 2 j l l α l b l d p s 1 l α l b l k l 1 where l is the light intensity in e m 2 h 1 or molγ m 2 h 1 α l is the specific photon arrival cross section m2 molps 1 b l is the binding rate of photons to free sus dimensionless d p s is the quantity of ps per unit of structural mass m v in molps molv 1 and k l is the dissociation rate in molγ molps 1 h 1 the unit of j l is not straightforward but it can be expressed in molnadph molv 1 h 1 using a conversion factor of 0 2 as 5 mol of photons are required per mole of nadph lika and papadakis 2009 sea lettuce relies on different mechanisms for photosynthetic carbon uptake the predominance of which depends on seawater chemistry e g ph temperature although the availability of free co2 can be limited direct diffusion may account for more than 50 at low ph axelsson et al 1995 some plants and algae including sea lettuce have developed mechanisms to utilize and concentrate hco3 as an indirect source of carbon at higher ph axelsson et al 1995 the uptake of carbon by sea lettuce may thus rely on a combination of direct co2 diffusion transport of hco3 through membrane channels and the intra and extra cellular surface bound dehydration of hco3 in co2 by the carbonic anhydrase for simplicity we consider that the second photosynthetic su utilizes either source of carbon to deliver co2 to the next su this can also be described through a michaelis menten relationship 3 j c o 2 j c o 2 m c o 2 c o 2 k c with j c o 2 m the maximum volume specific uptake rate of co2 in molco2 molv 1 h 1 co2 the concentration of carbon dioxide in the environment in molco2 l 1 and k c the half saturation constant in molco2 l 1 the products released by the first two photosynthetic sus i e nadph on one hand and co2 on the other hand are treated as complementary substrates in the third photosynthetic su and processed in parallel lorena et al 2010 it corresponds to the transformation of co2 into carbohydrates during the calvin benson cycle and results in a specific assimilation flux of carbon given by 4 j e c a 1 j e c a m 1 j c o 2 1 j l 1 j l j c o 2 1 where j e c a m is the maximum volume specific c assimilation rate in molc molv 1 h 1 and j l j l y l c and j c o 2 j c o 2 y c o 2 c are the specific arrival rates of nadph and co2 to the su respectively with y l c and y c o 2 c the stoichiometric coefficients that denote the yield of c per compound nadph and co2 respectively during the photolysis reaction of photosynthesis 4 mol of nadph and 1 mol of dioxygen are produced 2h2o 4 nadp light o2 4 nadph therefore the rate of oxygen production j o 2 go2 g 1 h 1 can be computed from j l eq 2 as 5 j o 2 m v w j l y l o 2 w o 2 with y l o 2 the yield of o2 per photon molo2 molγ 1 w the total biomass in g and w o 2 the molar weight of a molecule of dioxygen in g mol 1 2 1 3 reserve dynamics each reserve is then mobilized to fuel maintenance requirements the remainder being allocated to growth according to deb theory reserve densities m e i i n c follow first order dynamics which means that for a reserve e i the structure specific mobilized flux equals 6 j e i c m e i k e i r with k e i the turnover rate of the i th reserve and r the net specific growth rate 7 r 1 m v d m v d t which relates to the dilution by growth mobilized reserves are first used for maintenance which in deb theory refers to the turnover of structure maintenance of cellular gradients and maturity level maintenance among others the costs of maintenance are proportional to the structural volume and for a reserve e i they amount to a constant structure specific maintenance flux j e i m the flux from mobilized reserve to maintenance is given by 8 j e i m i m i n j e i c j e i m 2 1 4 growth maintenance and rejection each reserve therefore sends a structure specific flux 9 j e i g j e i c j e i m i to the growth su where they are all merged stoichiometrically to synthesize one c mole of structure reserves are treated complementarily and in parallel in the growth su which leads to a specific growth flux given by 10 j v g i j e i g y e i v 1 i j e i g y e i v 1 1 with y e i v the yield coefficient of the i th reserve to structure i e the number of moles of reserve e i required to synthesize one c mole of structure since nutrients are taken up independently one structure specific flux from reserve j e i g can limit the synthesis of structure in that case the non limiting flux will occupy the respective su s binding site without being promptly processed lorena et al 2010 as binding sites for the non limiting substrate all become occupied further arriving flux will be rejected by the growth su at a specific rate 11 j e i r j e i g y e i v j v g which corresponds to the difference between the available flux for growth and the flux actually used for growth the rejected fluxes are fed back to their respective reserve with a probability κ e i the rest being excreted in the environment this excretion mechanism ensures that non limiting reserves do not accumulate indefinitely if the mobilized flux for a given reserve is not enough to cover maintenance costs i e j e i m j e i c structure can be broken down to fill the deficit at a rate 12 j v m i j e i m j e i m i y e i v 1 the sum of the maintenance fluxes from structure amounts to j v m i j v m i therefore the net specific growth rate may be written as r j v g j v m and it is important to notice that it can be negative because r is implicit c f eq 6 we need to estimate its value at each time step to do so we used the sgr2 m function from the alga entry of the debtool package an online collection of scripts freely available https www bio vu nl thb deb deblab debtool debtool m manual index html to estimate the specific growth rate for a two reserve deb model using a newton raphson method with continuation finally at the exception of the photon binding rate b l lorena et al 2010 all rates are corrected for the effect

data from a starvation experiment collected specifically for this study and described hereafter 2 2 2 starvation experiment data in april 2017 sea lettuce thalli were collected in basin head prince edward island 46 23 07 0 n 62 07 13 8 w and transported to the dalhousie university aquatron wetlabs in halifax ns where they were placed in submerged mesh baskets in 12 tanks held at constant temperature 9 c matching in situ conditions at the time of collection tanks were covered to ensure complete darkness in order to block photosynthesis and therefore carbon assimilation over a period of 2 weeks and at a rate of 1 c per day temperature was gradually decreased to 4 c in three random tanks and increased to 10 16 and 22 c in the other tanks 3 tanks per condition measurements of dry weight gdw carbon c and nitrogen n tissue content in dw and seawater c and n concentration mol l 1 were collected when the algae were brought to the lab and every 3 4 weeks after that for 75 days three small mesh boxes containing an initial standardized weight of 3 gdw of sea lettuce were sampled from each tank throughout the experiment to monitor weight loss at each sampling date algae samples of about 20 g wet weight were collected in triplicate from each tank dried ground and kept frozen 20 c until c and n tissue content quantification later performed with a vario micro cube elemental analyzer elementar seawater nitrogen concentration no3 and no2 was determined from 3 ml samples collected in triplicate from each tank stored at 20 c before being analyzed with an autoanalyser hr iii seal analytica 2 2 3 parameter calibration all simulations and the parameter calibration were performed in matlab r2018b parameters of the arrhenius relationship were estimated via non linear regression we used the values given by lorena et al 2010 as initial values for the other parameters all experimental data sets were used at the same time to manually calibrate the model parameters the goodness of fit of the model to observed data was evaluated through root mean square error rmse for each data set a normalized rmse nrmse was determined to assess the overall quality of

dependant variable of data set n notice that as explained by marques et al 2019 including more data from the literature in the parameter estimation is likely to increase variation in environmental conditions and so in parameter values resulting in increased nrmse 2 3 model validation the parameters for the ulva deb model were validated against an in situ monitoring data set of sea lettuce

nutrient runoffs and usually shows scarcer sea lettuce presence we will refer to these systems as the high n estuary and low n estuary respectively in the high n estuary seven cross estuary transects and three water sampling points were determined from the up river to the bay and their gps coordinates recorded in the low n estuary 18 transects were established also with three sampling points each every two weeks we collected sea lettuce from each sampling point from a shallow vessel using oyster tongs oyster fishing tools consisting of two 4 m long rakes attached like scissor blades with a fixed raking area of 1 m2 algae were carefully sorted and separated from other material e g wood aquatic fauna inorganic material rinsed with seawater to clean mud or sand and excess water was removed using a large spin drier samples were weighed put in bags and stored at 20 c for further dry weight ash weight and c and n content analysis surface temperature was recorded with a ysi probe and water samples were collected in triplicates at three locations in each estuary upstream midstream and downstream to determine nutrient concentration in the seawater fig 2b c as the macroalgae were collected at more stations than water samples biomass data were clustered over three sub estuary areas each centred on the position of the corresponding water sampling location up mid and downstream analysis of c and n tissue content was conducted with a vario micro cube elemental analyzer elementar and nitrogen concentration no3 and no2 in seawater samples was quantified with an autoanalyzer hr iii seal analytica carbon dioxide concentration was assumed to remain constant over the study period at a value of 0 0001 mol l 1 corresponding to a pco2 of 350 μatm solar radiation data in kwh m 2 d 1 from the university of prince edward island climate lab downloaded from http projects upei ca climate research were used to compute light intensity in μe m 2 h 1 throughout the monitoring period using a correction factor of 0 3 to account for light absorption in seawater processes naturally occurring in the field such as drifting grazing and decomposition by bacteria can become important in late summer in malpeque bay resulting in significant biomass losses independently from the nutrient availability hammann and zimmer 2014 coffin et al 2017 based on such field observations we choose to account for these various processes through a stress function s meant to increase the lysis of structure through time this function was defined as 19 s f t j l r l t l j l 1 e x p r l t t l 1 where t is the time of the simulation in hours and the three parameters j l 0 0006 h 1 r l 0 01 and t l 2000 h are calibrated constants of the function corresponding to the maximum lysis rate the logistic growth rate and the activation point in time respectively the term s was then added to the sum of fluxes from structure to maintenance now amounting to 20 j v m i j v m i s 3 results 3 1 model calibration the parameters of the ulva deb model were estimated using seven independent studies table 2 the rmse was satisfactory for most data sets fig 3 growth rates predicted at 5 and 10 c in the study from tremblay gratton et al 2018 were underestimated although the rmse of 0 37 can still be considered satisfactory for growth data fig 3d carbon content in the study by figueroa et al 2009 was overestimated fig 3h however the observed drop through time is not expected nor well explained by the authors all predictions of dry weight and n c ratios for the starvation experiment were within the standard deviation of observations fig 3f i the nrmse obtained for this set of parameters was 10 81 this relatively high value was mostly driven by the overestimation in figueroa et al 2009 data set excluding these data from the procedure yielded a nrmse of 0 64 which can be considered to be very good the starvation experiment during which macroalgae were kept in the dark for 10 weeks allowed the calibration of the specific maintenance costs for nitrogen and carbon the green coloration of sea lettuce thalli started to fade past day 45 in the warmest condition 22 c and a complete degradation of the smallest algal sheets was observed in all conditions but the coldest 4 c at the last sampling of the experiment the arrhenius parameters estimated from three data sets rivers and peckol 1995 steffensen 1976 and fortes and lüning 1980 resulted in a temperature correction function with an adjusted r squared of 0 831 nonlinear regression model p value 9 13 10 10 fig 4 3 2 model validation overall sea lettuce biomass was remarkably lower in the low n estuary fig 5 d e f compared to the high n estuary fig 5a b c with a maximum biomass of 279 g m 2 in july 2017 in the low n estuary compared to a value of 1355 g m 2 in august 2017 in the high n estuary both recorded midstream the model was able to simulate the average sea lettuce biomass in both systems contrarily the model was not able to capture the observed short term dynamics but it is important to note the high variability in observations suggesting a high spatial variability in terms of sea lettuce biomass despite this variability a comparison of observed versus simulated data indicated an overall good accuracy of the model with an adjusted r squared of 0 92 p 0 001 fig 6 b for the low n estuary and an adjusted r squared of 0 78 p 0 001 fig 6a for the high n estuary the model seemed to perform better in the low n estuary as indicated by the nrmse of 0 11 for the low n estuary and 0 14 for the high n estuary as expected the level of n concentration in the high n estuary table 3 did not limit the growth of sea lettuce as evidenced by the stable reserve n fig 7 a self shading temporarily reduced c reserve in late july early august but the n c ratio remained stable fig 7c contrarily the highly variable n reserve fig 7d and n c ratio fig 7f in sea lettuce growing in the low n estuary show that nitrogen was the limiting substrate 4 discussion with increasing concerns of the impact of macroalgal blooms on the resilience and durability of ecosystems progress in understanding and predicting their development and impact is crucial to developing successful ecosystem management policies the model presented in this study is the first comprehensive deb model ever developed for a macroalgal species using the concept of synthesizing units to implement the assimilation of energy through photosynthesis and its allocation to the different metabolic functions this model represents a key advancement in the theory and in the field of coastal ecological modelling it provides a mechanistic understanding of nutrient uptake and utilization that was calibrated on a series of literature data sets and validated in a natural environment in this section we first discuss the nitrogen assimilation module then the carbon assimilation module and finally the validation of the model in malpeque bay 4 1 nitrogen assimilation the main interest in modelling opportunistic macroalgae such as sea lettuce lies in the possibility to predict and quantify their rapid growth capacities and the potential impacts on their surrounding environment in the context of climate change and increasing human activities in the coastal zone macroalgal blooms have increased in recent decades due to the rise of temperatures and nutrient runoffs xing et al 2015 therefore a key part of the modelling process lies in the assimilation of nutrients the parameters of the ulva deb model linked to the uptake of nitrogen can be compared to previously reported values in the literature cohen and neori 1991 measured maximum assimilation rates of nitrogen between 50 and 390 μmol g 1 h 1 fujita 1985reported values between 138 and 252 μmol g 1 h 1 and runcie et al 2003 observed rates ranging from 116 to 450 μmol g 1 h 1 these figures compare well with our estimate of 140 μmol g 1 h 1 or 4 5 mmol molv 1 h 1 the range of measured values in the literature corresponds to different acclimation conditions i e limiting or sufficient nitrogen concentration in the water or different substrates e g nitrate ammonium showing how the uptake capacity of sea lettuce may vary with their internal state and in response to environmental conditions half saturation coefficients such as kn which is key to determine the nitrogen assimilation rate generally depend on the characteristics of the environment and consequently are highly variable across studies solidoro et al 1997 incidentally this parameter is often used to calibrate the energy input of deb models rosland et al 2009 alunno bruscia et al 2011 perrot et al 2014 in their growth model for sea lettuce proliferation on the atlantic coast of france also relied on this physiological plasticity to calibrate the maximum nitrogen uptake rate 40 200 μmol gdw 1 h 1 as well as the half saturation coefficient 5 50 μmol l 1 according to seasonal changes and site specific conditions because our two study sites were relatively close to each other we kept a fixed value for kn that was estimated at 40 μmol l 1 despite the large variation in nutrient loads between and within the two systems the model seemed to reproduce accurately the observed biomass in each location we did not distinguish between the different forms of dissolved nitrogen nitrate ammonium nitrite or urea and rather considered a general pool of nitrogen used to fuel the metabolism however studies have shown that sea lettuce preferentially assimilate ammonium over nitrate e g wang et al 2014 urea and amino acids can also constitute up to 90 of total macroalgal nitrogen uptake when dissolved inorganic nitrogen availability is low tyler et al 2005 we also considered nitrogen alone but other elements such as phosphorus tremblay gratton et al 2018 may be included in further developments the comparison of experimental results highlights the fact that as coastal waters increasingly undergo nutrient enrichment blooms of algae will increase and that the limiting element supporting the growth initially nitrogen may shift to phosphorus in those waters subject to the highest nitrogen loadings teichberg et al 2010 measurements of phosphorus ortho phosphate concentration conducted on the same water samples collected in this study showed a better co variation with sea lettuce biomass along the estuary gradient p 4 546 10 9 adjusted r squared 0 4769 than nitrogen nitrite nitrate p 9 235 10 4 adjusted r squared 0 1764 unpublished results this may suggest that phosphorus is of greater importance to sea lettuce growth and model accuracy in natural conditions might benefit from the addition of this other substrate filgueira et al 2015 evoked the possibility that phytoplankton productivity might not be limited by nitrogen since turbidity and the adsorption of phosphorous to the iron rich soils of pei may cause light and phosphorous to be limiting factors however n p ratios in the high n 0 59 and in the low n 10 53 estuaries are both well below the redfield ratio of 16 which points towards a limitation by n more data is therefore warranted to determine the actual limiting nutrient for primary producers in this environment it is important to note that the addition of another substrate for growth in the model would require another state variable and six additional parameters greatly increasing its complexity this trade off between simplicity of the model and accuracy is a recurrent issue in numerical modelling and the final decision usually depends on the purpose of the study in the present case there is limited value to adding more parameters given that the contrasted average total nutrient load in the studied estuaries table 3 undoubtedly explains the difference in growth potential of sea lettuce in these locations 4 2 carbon assimilation previous deb models for microalgae characterized carbon fixation through photosynthesis in more or less complex ways using the concept of synthesizing units papadakis et al 2005 some of them including photoinhibition lorena et al 2010 or photorespiration kooijman et al 2010 sea lettuce does not seem to be subject to photoinhibition especially in high latitude ecosystems rivers and peckol 1995 self shading however has been identified as a common cause for rapid collapse of macroalgal blooms carpenter 1990 perrot et al 2014 in our model this process is key to the simulation of biomass dynamics in the estuaries of malpeque bay without this component sea lettuce biomass would increase infinitely especially in the high n estuary where n is not limiting in deb theory algae are classified as supply organisms as opposed to a demand type they are extremely flexible in terms of growth and shrinkage growth rate can in fact be negative which depend on feeding conditions demand systems conversely depend on processes that use energy such as maintenance and growth which requires energy intake of matching size kooijman 2010 the limitation of growth through the self shading function is therefore an indirect process perrot et al 2014 also noted the strong influence of self shading in the limitation of total production and reported observations of its effect at a biomass threshold of 1 kg m 2 the same as in our model table 2 yet conflicting findings exist in the literature some studies found that stocking densities of 1 kg m 2 resulted in better growth compared to macroalgae grown at 3 kg m 2 msuya 2008 while other reports indicated that nitrogen uptake rate was insensitive to algal stocking density in the range of 1 6 kg m 2 cohen and neori 1991 the threshold biomass used in the self shading correction factor in the model 1000 g m 2 falls in line with the values reported in these two studies discrete measurements of light extinction under sea lettuce mats in malpeque bay carried out with a licor li 193 spherical underwater quantum sensor in september 2017 during the validation study indicated that photon penetration can drop rapidly immediately under these floating mats however it is complicated to estimate these effects in situ as sea lettuce in these estuaries is free floating in the water and subject to displacement by currents and wind water turbidity may also be relevant at some times of the year following intense precipitations and may be considered to attenuate light intensity concentration of chlorophyll a varies in time and with environmental conditions such as light intensity and nutrient concentrations bischof et al 2002 figueroa et al 2009 in this model the density of photosynthetic units d p s was kept constant for simplicity but more precise predictions might require taking into account this physiological plasticity faugeras et al 2004 indeed the capacity of macroalgae to adjust the concentration sensitivity of photoreceptors might mitigate the effects of self shading up to a certain point lorena et al 2010 discussed these implications for a microalgae deb model and suggested to consider an additional structure if one was to model photoacclimation 4 3 model validation and ecological implications as this model was calibrated using experimental data processes such as grazing or drifting were included after the calibration of model parameters through a stress function aiming at reducing sea lettuce biomass although sea lettuce can attach to various substrates rock wood metal shells via a small disc holdfast it is mostly found drifting in the water column in the studied area likely due to the soft nature of the bottom sand or mud mostly thalli may thus drift freely in the water column forced by wind and currents and accumulate in areas such as the head of estuaries or small embayments drifting may have two consequences on modelled sea lettuce dynamics i the underestimation of sea lettuce biomass at the peak of production in july august when precipitation is low and river flow is reduced leading to a rather stagnant system where sea lettuce accumulates on the sides of the estuaries and ii the overestimation of biomass at the end of the growing season in september october when sea lettuce becomes more subject to drifting possibly due to increased river flow and wind coupling to a spatialized hydrodynamic model in which wind and current dispersal effects are accounted for would address these issues the addition of the stress function to the model must temper our confidence in the validation process and more robust validation is therefore necessary which could be obtained with the use of observed data at the individual scale through mesocosm experiments in coastal and estuarine systems the importance of macroalgae in nutrient cycling is well known hanisak 1993 human et al 2015 lanari et al 2017 however data on the rate of decomposition of sea lettuce thalli are rare hanisak 1993 it is commonly accepted that opportunistic algae developed physiological strategies through evolution allowing them to grow and reproduce quickly and resist stress lenzi et al 2015 low maintenance costs result in more energy allocated to the building of structure and the low value of maintenance parameters in our model j e n m 6 7 10 4 moln molv 1 h 1 j e c m 1 6 10 4 molc molv 1 h 1 reflect this characteristic these values are much lower than those estimated for the phytoplankton species thalassiosira weissflogii 1 2 10 2 moln molv 1 h 1 and 5 4 10 2 molc g 1 h 1 lorena et al 2010 however because the starvation experiment was conducted in controlled conditions excluding grazers and bacterial degradation the measured rate of decomposition as weight loss should be regarded as a minimum estimation compared to the rapid degradation sometimes observed in the wild lenzi et al 2015 reports of excessive nutrient runoff leading to blooms of primary producers in coastal areas around the world are accumulating glibert 2016 liu et al 2016 the aftermath of such productivity can lead to hypoxia or anoxia which may result in die off of fauna and other ecological consequences giordani et al 1996 coffin et al 2018a b while better practices in nutrient runoff management remain paramount to limit the effects of coastal eutrophication there is growing interest in developing commercial usages of sea lettuce for example as part of integrated aquaculture frameworks hadley et al 2015 animal feed bansemer et al 2016 bio fuels barbot et al 2016 or in biochemical applications e g crop fertilizer which might help mitigating these effects because the development of macroalgae in estuaries effectively traps catchment derived nutrients the export of nitrogen to deeper and more open waters can be reduced woodland et al 2015 xiao et al 2017 on prince edward island a pilot study investigating the feasibility of a removal program of sea lettuce in local bays highlighted the technical difficulty and high cost of such an enterprise especially considering that the macroalgal populations can double in size in just a few days crane and ramsay 2012 the current model constitutes a tool that may be useful in some of these applications especially regarding nutrient cycling and growth predictions 5 conclusions in this study we presented the first comprehensive deb model for a macroalgal species a mechanistic model that we successfully validated in field conditions while model improvements are always possible the agreement between model predictions and observed data in the field is remarkable especially considering that the parameter values of the ulva deb model did not result from any statistical optimization procedure further validation should be conducted by testing the applicability of the model to other locations the inclusion of other nutrient sources such as phosphorus may help capture more variability in sea lettuce biomass and should be tested in malpeque bay as well as in other locations depending on the characteristics of these new environments another important validation step is the application of this model to other macroalgal species which is being addressed in an ongoing study on the sugar kelp saccharina latissima in narraganset bay rhode island usa collaboration with a humphries university of rhode island further refinement of these models will serve to prove the benefit of using mechanistic models such as those based on deb theory because sea lettuce develops in shallow embayments and estuaries its impact on nutrient cycling is direct the quantification of this impact through a process based model offers an opportunity to better understand and predict the dynamics of coastal systems potential interactions with the phytoplankton community and impacts on shellfish production in malpeque bay have been hypothesized by filgueira et al 2015 these questions are currently being investigated using the present deb model within the modelling framework designed by these authors lavaud et al in prep such approaches combining physiological processes at the individual level population dynamics and inter specific interactions at the scale of the ecosystem are hoped to help us predict the impacts of future changes on these systems which ultimately inform estuarine planning and management declaration of competing interest the

24912,macroalgal blooms in eutrophic coastal waters around the globe constitute a rising issue for ecosystems and economic activities sometimes leading to anoxic events a better understanding of its growth dynamics is necessary to develop mitigation strategies and inform policies on nutrient runoff management the development of a dynamic energy budget deb model for the sea lettuce ulva lactuca provides a generic mechanistic description of energy and matter fluxes within the macroalgae and between macroalgae and the environment forcing variables consist of seawater temperature light intensity and seawater concentrations of dissolved carbon and nitrogen the model includes a self shading module for light reduction under heavy biomass and simulation outputs consist of but are not limited to total algae biomass nutrient uptake carbon and nitrogen photosynthetic rate and state of nutrient reserve model parameters were estimated using data sets from the literature and laboratory experiments then validated using an independent field study in two estuaries with contrasting nutrient loads that feed into malpeque bay pei canada the validation step yielded accurate temporal predictions of sea lettuce biomass in both of these estuaries these results indicate that the present mechanistic modelling approach for predicting sea lettuce dynamics captures salient patterns along a spectrum of nutrient loading and could therefore be of use for managing across diverse ecological conditions which is particularly relevant for a widespread species like ulva lactuca keywords sea lettuce nutrients photosynthesis eutrophication estuary synthesizing units 1 introduction blooms of opportunistic macroalgae are a growing concern in the context of climate change and coastal eutrophication blooms of sea lettuce ulva spp are a prime example of one of the consequences of the increase of nutrient inputs from land all around the world smetacek and zingone 2013 on prince edward island pei eastern canada where 40 of the land is cleared for agricultural use nutrient runoff is the root cause of eutrophication and subsequent sea lettuce blooms in near shore marine areas crane and ramsay 2012 leading to recurrent anoxia events coffin et al 2018a the green macroalga ulva lactuca is naturally found in many bays and estuaries often free floating in the water column and sometimes producing very dense mats at the water s surface despite the increase in nitrogen loads flora shifts from a greater proportion of phytoplankton to macroalgae may be more common in eutrophic waters wang et al 2012 wallace and gobler 2015 a recent study by filgueira et al 2015 suggested that a reduction in phytoplankton biomass from competition for nutrients with the sea lettuce and consumption by farmed and natural mollusks may limit the capacity of new aquafarms in some areas emphasizing the necessity to include opportunistic macroalgae in models aiming at quantifying ecosystem dynamics modelling studies of primary producers in aquatic environments are mostly restricted to unicellular microalgae i e phytoplankton the emerging interest in macroalgae in light of the prevalence of eutrophication and their importance as a resource has recently prompted modelling studies hadley et al 2015 seghetta et al 2016 in order to assess the threat they may represent for coastal ecosystems health and some industries e g fish and shellfish aquaculture tourism these models can take different forms ranging from empirical models using simple analytic formulae duarte and ferreira

play an important role in algae modelling de los santos et al 2009 anderson et al 2010 mcgillicuddy 2010 hadley et al 2015 providing a link between conceptual and dynamic modelling such models can be coupled to other modules in box models formalizing the interactions between the environment and organisms in more mechanistic frameworks which can yield insights into physiological processes ren et al

capacity and generalization to be applied to other species locations and times one framework the dynamic energy budget deb theory may address this weakness deb provides a comprehensive description of the metabolic organization of individuals that allows the modelling of energy and mass fluxes between the environment and the organism and within the organism kooijman 2010 deb theory is generalist as

and composition of kelp further development of this type of modelling could be ideal to accurately assess and quantify the potential impact of opportunistic macroalgae on complex ecosystems such as coastal bays and estuaries in this paper we present the first comprehensive deb model for a macroalgal species we describe the development of the model for the sea lettuce ulva lactuca its calibration using literature and experimental data and its application to a field study conducted in malpeque bay pei canada this work represents an important advancement for the modelling of coastal ecosystems it allows the quantification of the potential impact of sea lettuce on the nutrient dynamics in such complex and ever changing systems 2 material and methods 2 1 the ulva deb model 2 1 1 general concepts the deb theory is governed by assumptions allowing a sound description of the metabolic organization in compatibility with physics and evolutionary laws the strong homeostasis hypothesis kooijman 2010 is a core assumption in deb theory stating that the structure v and the reserve s e do not change in chemical composition and thermodynamic properties a stable internal chemical composition means that organisms have a higher control over their own metabolism because the rate of chemical reactions depends on the chemical composition of the surrounding environment sousa et al 2008 when assimilation pathways are essentially independent such as in algae and other autotrophs the constant chemical composition of reserves can only be ensured if there are different reserves for each assimilation pathway kooijman 2010 we considered here two substrates carbon and nitrogen each with a corresponding assimilation pathway and reserve other nutrients such as phosphorus could be added with similar dynamics as that of nitrogen but many studies showed that nitrogen prevails as the main limiting substrate for sea lettuce teichberg et al 2010 and references within synthesizing units sus defined as conceptual enzymes in deb theory kooijman 2010 were used to perform all transformations of one or several substrate molecules into one or several product molecules these mechanistic transformations were defined at the individual level for nutrient uptake as it is the appropriate level of organization for this process poggiale et al 2010 these uptake formulations were then included in a deb population model which dynamics were represented by three state variables structure m v molv nitrogen reserve density m e n m e n m v moln molv 1 and carbon reserve density m e c m e c m v molc molv 1 with m e c and m e n the respective mass of carbon and nitrogen reserves nutrients are first transformed into reserves through dedicated assimilation sus fig 1 each reserve is mobilized independently and first allocated to a dedicated maintenance su finally the remaining reserve fluxes are combined in a single growth su to produce structure because the dynamics of each reserve can be different the growth su can receive more of one type of substrate this results in the rejection of a certain quantity of this substrate a fraction of which is fed back to its reserve while the other is excreted when mobilized reserves are not sufficient to cover maintenance costs structural mass is broken down to fulfill the required maintenance cost sea lettuce thalli are constituted of two cell layers separated by an intercellular volume which can be considered negligible as a results surface area and volume vary linearly which qualifies sea lettuce as a v1 morph as specified in the deb terminology i e organisms with a surface area proportional to volume this simplifies all model equations as compared to models for isomorphs in the life cycle of sea lettuce both sexual and asexual reproduction occurs due to a lack of data on these mechanisms and for simplicity the model in its current form does not account for reproductive processes we now detail the equations of the model which is based on the models previously developed for microalgae by papadakis et al 2005 lorena et al 2010 and more recently livanou et al 2019 2 1 2 assimilation of nutrients the different forms of nitrogen taken up from the environment by macroalgae primarily consist of nitrate ammonium urea and amino acids tyler et al 2005 giordano and raven 2014 however nitrate is the major source kennison et al 2011 nitrogen uptake is operated by active transporter proteins in the cell membrane and is usually transformed to be assimilated into reserve as glutamate although it may also be temporarily stored as nitrate amino acids or proteins prior to assimilation giordano and raven 2014 the incorporation of nitrogen into reserve is described in the model by a michaelis menten relationship 1 j e n a j e n a m n n k n with j e n a m the maximum volume specific assimilation rate in moln molv 1 h 1 n the concentration of dissolved nitrogen in the environment in moln l 1 and kn the half saturation constant in moln l 1 throughout this study rates such as j e n a m are expressed per c mol of structure the assimilation of carbon through photosynthesis is more complex requiring two substrates photons and co2 three photosynthetic sus are used to model the different steps of photosynthesis fig 1 a first su in the chloroplasts captures the photon flux through the photosystems ps and utilizes this energy to produce nadph this represents the light dependent reaction of photosynthesis which also produces atp a second su handles the uptake of co2 and a third su utilizes the products of the first two to assimilate carbon as carbohydrates into the reserve this represents the calvin benson cycle as in papadakis et al 2005 we considered simple dynamics for the capture of photons denoted γ by the first photosynthetic su with no photorespiration the relaxation rate of products by the first photosynthetic su at steady state is denoted jl in molγ molv 1 h 1 and is given by 2 j l l α l b l d p s 1 l α l b l k l 1 where l is the light intensity in e m 2 h 1 or molγ m 2 h 1 α l is the specific photon arrival cross section m2 molps 1 b l is the binding rate of photons to free sus dimensionless d p s is the quantity of ps per unit of structural mass m v in molps molv 1 and k l is the dissociation rate in molγ molps 1 h 1 the unit of j l is not straightforward but it can be expressed in molnadph molv 1 h 1 using a conversion factor of 0 2 as 5 mol of photons are required per mole of nadph lika and papadakis 2009 sea lettuce relies on different mechanisms for photosynthetic carbon uptake the predominance of which depends on seawater chemistry e g ph temperature although the availability of free co2 can be limited direct diffusion may account for more than 50 at low ph axelsson et al 1995 some plants and algae including sea lettuce have developed mechanisms to utilize and concentrate hco3 as an indirect source of carbon at higher ph axelsson et al 1995 the uptake of carbon by sea lettuce may thus rely on a combination of direct co2 diffusion transport of hco3 through membrane channels and the intra and extra cellular surface bound dehydration of hco3 in co2 by the carbonic anhydrase for simplicity we consider that the second photosynthetic su utilizes either source of carbon to deliver co2 to the next su this can also be described through a michaelis menten relationship 3 j c o 2 j c o 2 m c o 2 c o 2 k c with j c o 2 m the maximum volume specific uptake rate of co2 in molco2 molv 1 h 1 co2 the concentration of carbon dioxide in the environment in molco2 l 1 and k c the half saturation constant in molco2 l 1 the products released by the first two photosynthetic sus i e nadph on one hand and co2 on the other hand are treated as complementary substrates in the third photosynthetic su and processed in parallel lorena et al 2010 it corresponds to the transformation of co2 into carbohydrates during the calvin benson cycle and results in a specific assimilation flux of carbon given by 4 j e c a 1 j e c a m 1 j c o 2 1 j l 1 j l j c o 2 1 where j e c a m is the maximum volume specific c assimilation rate in molc molv 1 h 1 and j l j l y l c and j c o 2 j c o 2 y c o 2 c are the specific arrival rates of nadph and co2 to the su respectively with y l c and y c o 2 c the stoichiometric coefficients that denote the yield of

of a molecule of dioxygen in g mol 1 2 1 3 reserve dynamics each reserve is then mobilized to fuel maintenance requirements the remainder being allocated to growth according to deb theory reserve densities m e i i n c follow first order dynamics which means that for a reserve e i the structure specific mobilized flux equals 6 j e i c m e i k e i r with k e i the turnover rate of the i th reserve and r the net specific growth rate 7 r 1 m v d m v d t which relates to the dilution by growth mobilized reserves are first used for maintenance which in deb theory refers to the turnover of structure maintenance of cellular gradients and maturity level maintenance among others the costs of maintenance are proportional to the structural volume and for a reserve e i they amount to a constant structure specific maintenance flux j e i m the flux from mobilized reserve to maintenance is given by 8 j e i m i m i n j e i c j e i m 2 1 4 growth maintenance and rejection each reserve therefore sends a structure specific flux 9 j e i g j e i c j e i m i to the growth su where they are all merged stoichiometrically to synthesize one c mole of structure reserves are treated

experimental data sets from the literature table 1 including nitrogen uptake rate runcie et al 2003 gordillo et al 2001 photosynthetic production rate rivers and peckol 1995 riccardi and solidoro 1996 growth rate steffensen 1976 fortes and lüning 1980 gordillo et al 2001 tremblay gratton et al 2018 and c and n contents gordillo et al 2001 figueroa et al 2009 tremblay gratton et al 2018 as well as data from a starvation experiment collected specifically for this study and described hereafter 2 2 2 starvation experiment data in april 2017 sea lettuce thalli were collected in basin head prince edward island 46 23 07 0 n 62 07 13 8 w and transported to the dalhousie university aquatron wetlabs in halifax ns where they were placed in submerged mesh baskets in 12 tanks held at constant temperature 9 c matching in situ conditions at the time of collection tanks were covered to ensure complete darkness in order to block photosynthesis and therefore carbon assimilation over a period of 2 weeks and at a rate of 1 c per day temperature was gradually decreased to 4 c in three random tanks and increased to 10 16 and 22 c in the other tanks 3 tanks per condition measurements of dry weight gdw carbon c and nitrogen n tissue content in dw and seawater c and n concentration mol l 1 were collected when the algae were brought to the lab and every 3 4 weeks after that for 75 days three small mesh boxes containing an initial standardized weight of 3 gdw of sea lettuce were sampled from each tank throughout the experiment to monitor weight loss at each sampling date algae samples of about 20 g wet weight were collected in triplicate from each tank dried ground and kept frozen 20 c until c and n tissue content quantification later performed with a vario micro cube elemental analyzer elementar seawater nitrogen concentration no3 and no2 was determined from 3 ml samples collected in triplicate from each tank stored at 20 c before being analyzed with an autoanalyser hr iii seal analytica 2 2 3 parameter calibration all simulations and the parameter calibration were performed in matlab r2018b parameters of the arrhenius relationship were estimated via non linear regression we used the values given by lorena et al 2010 as initial values for the other parameters all experimental data sets were used at the same time to manually calibrate the model parameters the goodness of fit of the model to observed data was evaluated through root mean square error rmse for each data set a normalized rmse nrmse was determined to assess the overall quality of the estimated parameters by calculating the average of each data set s normalized rmse as given by 18 n r m s e 1 n i 1 n r m s e i max p i j m i n p i j with pij the set of predictions for the dependant variable of data set n notice that as explained by marques et al 2019 including more data from the literature in the parameter estimation is likely to increase variation in environmental conditions and so in parameter values resulting in increased nrmse 2 3 model validation the parameters for the ulva deb model were validated against an in situ monitoring data set of sea lettuce biomass over an entire growing season model performance was evaluated through type 2 linear regressions between observed and simulated data algae were collected in two estuaries that feed into malpeque bay prince edward island canada between 18 may and 02 november 2017 fig 2 these two locations were selected for their known contrasted nutrient load and sea lettuce abundance barbara weit 0 71 km2 located south east of the bay receives high nitrogen inputs and usually shows high sea lettuce biomasses the tyne valley estuary 1 44 km2 located at the north west of the bay has limited nutrient runoffs and usually shows scarcer sea lettuce presence we will refer to these systems as the high n estuary and low n estuary respectively in the high n estuary seven cross estuary transects and three water sampling points were determined from the up river to the bay and their gps coordinates recorded in the low n estuary 18 transects were established also with three sampling points each every two weeks we collected sea lettuce from each sampling point from a shallow vessel using oyster tongs oyster fishing tools consisting of two 4 m long rakes attached like scissor blades with a fixed raking area of 1 m2 algae were carefully sorted and separated from other material e g wood aquatic fauna inorganic material rinsed with seawater to clean mud or sand and excess water was removed using a large spin drier samples were weighed put in bags and stored at 20 c for further dry weight ash weight and c and n content analysis surface temperature was recorded with a ysi probe and water samples were collected in triplicates at three locations in each estuary upstream midstream and downstream to determine nutrient concentration in the seawater fig 2b c as the macroalgae were collected at more stations than water samples biomass data were clustered over three sub estuary areas each centred on the position of the corresponding water sampling location up mid and downstream analysis of c and n tissue content was conducted with a vario micro cube elemental analyzer elementar and nitrogen concentration no3 and no2 in seawater samples was quantified with an autoanalyzer hr iii seal analytica carbon dioxide concentration was assumed to remain constant over the study period at a value of 0 0001 mol l 1 corresponding to a pco2 of 350 μatm solar radiation data in kwh m 2 d 1 from the university of prince edward island climate lab downloaded from http projects upei ca climate research were used to compute light intensity in μe m 2 h 1 throughout the monitoring period using a correction factor of 0 3 to account for light absorption in seawater processes naturally occurring in the field such as drifting grazing and decomposition by bacteria can become important in late summer in malpeque bay resulting in significant biomass losses independently from the nutrient availability hammann and zimmer 2014 coffin et al 2017 based on such field observations we choose to account for these various processes through a stress function s meant to increase the lysis of structure through time this function was defined as 19 s f t j l r l t l j l 1 e x p r l t t l 1 where t is the time of the simulation in hours and the three parameters j l 0 0006 h 1 r l 0 01 and t l 2000 h are calibrated constants of the function corresponding to the maximum lysis rate the logistic growth rate and the activation point in time respectively the term s was then added to the sum of fluxes from structure to maintenance now amounting to 20 j v m i j v m i s 3 results 3 1 model calibration the parameters of the ulva deb model were estimated using seven independent studies table 2 the rmse was satisfactory for most data sets fig 3 growth rates predicted at 5 and 10 c in the study from tremblay gratton et al 2018 were underestimated although the rmse of 0 37 can still be considered satisfactory for growth data fig 3d carbon content in the study by figueroa et al 2009 was overestimated fig 3h however the observed drop through time is not expected nor well explained by the authors all predictions of dry weight and n c ratios for the starvation experiment were within the standard deviation of observations fig 3f i the nrmse obtained for this set of parameters was 10 81 this relatively high value was mostly driven by the overestimation in figueroa et al 2009 data set excluding these data from the procedure yielded a nrmse of 0 64 which can be considered to be very good the starvation experiment during which macroalgae were kept in the dark for 10 weeks allowed the calibration of the specific maintenance costs for nitrogen and carbon the green coloration of sea lettuce thalli started to fade past day 45 in the warmest condition 22 c and a complete degradation of the smallest algal sheets was observed in all conditions but the coldest 4 c at the last sampling of the experiment the arrhenius parameters estimated from three data sets rivers and peckol 1995 steffensen 1976 and fortes and lüning 1980 resulted in a temperature correction function with an adjusted r squared of 0 831 nonlinear regression model p value 9 13 10 10 fig 4 3 2 model validation overall sea lettuce biomass was remarkably lower in the low n estuary fig 5 d e f compared to the high n estuary fig 5a b c with a maximum biomass of 279 g m 2 in july 2017 in the low n estuary compared to a value of 1355 g m 2 in august 2017 in the high n estuary both recorded midstream the model was able to simulate the average sea lettuce biomass in both systems contrarily the model was not able to capture the observed short term dynamics but it is important to note the high variability in observations suggesting a high spatial variability in terms of sea lettuce biomass despite this variability a comparison of observed versus simulated data indicated an overall good accuracy of the model with an adjusted r squared of 0 92 p 0 001 fig 6 b for the low n estuary and an adjusted r squared of 0 78 p 0 001 fig 6a for the high n estuary the model seemed to perform better in the low n estuary as indicated by the nrmse of 0 11 for the low n estuary and 0 14 for the high n estuary as expected the level of n concentration in the high n estuary table 3 did not limit the growth of sea lettuce as evidenced by the stable reserve n fig 7 a self shading temporarily reduced c reserve in late july early august but the n c ratio remained stable fig 7c contrarily the highly variable n reserve fig 7d and n c ratio fig 7f in sea lettuce growing in the low n estuary show that nitrogen was the limiting substrate 4 discussion with increasing concerns of the impact of macroalgal blooms on the resilience and durability of ecosystems progress in understanding and predicting their development and impact is crucial to developing successful ecosystem management policies the model presented in this study is the first comprehensive deb model ever developed for a macroalgal species using the concept of synthesizing units to implement the assimilation of energy through photosynthesis and its allocation to the different metabolic functions this model represents a key advancement in the theory and in the field of coastal ecological modelling it provides a mechanistic understanding of nutrient uptake and utilization that was calibrated on a series of literature data sets and validated in a natural environment in this section we first discuss the nitrogen assimilation module then the carbon assimilation module and finally the validation of the model in malpeque bay 4 1 nitrogen assimilation the main interest in modelling opportunistic macroalgae such as sea lettuce lies in the possibility to predict and quantify their rapid growth capacities and the potential impacts on their surrounding environment in the context of climate change and increasing human activities in the coastal zone macroalgal blooms have increased in recent decades due to the rise of temperatures and nutrient runoffs xing et al 2015 therefore a key part of the modelling process lies in the assimilation of nutrients the parameters of the ulva deb model linked to the uptake of nitrogen can be compared to previously reported values in the literature cohen and neori 1991 measured maximum assimilation rates of nitrogen between 50 and 390 μmol g 1 h 1 fujita 1985reported values between 138 and 252 μmol g 1 h 1 and runcie et al 2003 observed rates ranging from 116 to 450 μmol g 1 h 1 these figures compare well with our estimate of 140 μmol g 1 h 1 or 4 5 mmol molv 1 h 1 the range of measured values in the literature corresponds to different acclimation conditions i e limiting or sufficient nitrogen concentration in the water or different substrates e g nitrate ammonium showing how the uptake capacity of sea lettuce may vary with their internal state and in response to environmental conditions half saturation coefficients such as kn which is key to determine the nitrogen assimilation rate generally depend on the characteristics of the environment and consequently are highly variable across studies solidoro et al 1997 incidentally this parameter is often used to calibrate the energy input of deb models rosland et al 2009 alunno bruscia et al 2011 perrot et al 2014 in their growth model for sea lettuce proliferation on the atlantic coast of france also relied on this physiological plasticity to calibrate the maximum nitrogen uptake rate 40 200 μmol gdw 1 h 1 as well as the half saturation coefficient 5 50 μmol l 1 according to seasonal changes and site specific conditions because our two study sites were relatively close to each other we kept a fixed value for kn that was estimated at 40 μmol l 1 despite the large variation in nutrient loads between and within the two systems the model seemed to reproduce accurately the observed biomass in each location we did not distinguish between the different forms of dissolved nitrogen nitrate ammonium nitrite or urea and rather considered a general pool of nitrogen used to fuel the metabolism however studies have shown that sea lettuce preferentially assimilate ammonium over nitrate e g wang et al 2014 urea and amino acids can also constitute up to 90 of total macroalgal nitrogen uptake when dissolved inorganic nitrogen availability is low tyler et al 2005 we also considered nitrogen alone but other elements such as phosphorus tremblay gratton et al 2018 may be included in further developments the comparison of experimental results highlights the fact that as coastal waters increasingly undergo nutrient enrichment blooms of algae will increase and that the limiting element supporting the growth initially nitrogen may shift to phosphorus in those waters subject to the highest nitrogen loadings teichberg et al 2010 measurements of phosphorus ortho phosphate concentration conducted on the same water samples collected in this study showed a better co variation with sea lettuce biomass along the estuary gradient p 4 546 10 9 adjusted r squared 0 4769 than nitrogen nitrite nitrate p 9 235 10 4 adjusted r squared 0 1764 unpublished results this may suggest that phosphorus is of greater importance to sea lettuce growth and model accuracy in natural conditions might benefit from the addition of this other substrate filgueira et al 2015 evoked the possibility that phytoplankton productivity might not be limited by nitrogen since turbidity and the adsorption of phosphorous to the iron rich soils of pei may cause light and phosphorous to be limiting factors however n p ratios in the high n 0 59 and in the low n 10 53 estuaries are both well below the redfield ratio of 16 which points towards a limitation by n more data is therefore warranted to determine the actual limiting nutrient for primary producers in this environment it is important to note that the addition of another substrate for growth in the model would require another state variable and six additional parameters greatly increasing its complexity this trade off between simplicity of the model and accuracy is a recurrent issue in numerical modelling and the final decision usually depends on the purpose of the study in the present case there is limited value to adding more parameters given that the contrasted average total nutrient load in the studied estuaries table 3 undoubtedly explains the difference in growth potential of sea lettuce in these locations 4 2 carbon assimilation previous deb models for microalgae characterized carbon fixation through photosynthesis in more or less complex ways using the concept of synthesizing units papadakis et al 2005 some of them including photoinhibition lorena et al 2010 or photorespiration kooijman et al 2010 sea lettuce does not seem to be subject to photoinhibition especially in high latitude ecosystems rivers and peckol 1995 self shading however has been identified as a common cause for rapid collapse of macroalgal blooms carpenter 1990 perrot et al 2014 in our model this process is key to the simulation of biomass dynamics in the estuaries of malpeque bay without this component sea lettuce biomass would increase infinitely especially in the high n estuary where n is not limiting in deb theory algae are classified as supply organisms as opposed to a demand type they are extremely flexible in terms of growth and shrinkage growth rate can in fact be negative which depend on feeding conditions demand systems conversely depend on processes that use energy such as maintenance and growth which requires energy intake of matching size kooijman 2010 the limitation of growth through the self shading function is therefore an indirect process perrot et al 2014 also noted the strong influence of self shading in the limitation of total production and reported observations of its effect at a biomass threshold of 1 kg m 2 the same as in our model table 2 yet conflicting findings exist in the literature some studies found that stocking densities of 1 kg m 2 resulted in better growth compared to macroalgae grown at 3 kg m 2 msuya 2008 while other reports indicated that nitrogen uptake rate was insensitive to algal stocking density in the range of 1 6 kg m 2 cohen and neori 1991 the threshold biomass used in the self shading correction factor in the model 1000 g m 2 falls in line with the values reported in these two studies discrete measurements of light extinction under sea lettuce mats in malpeque bay carried out with a licor li 193 spherical underwater quantum sensor in september 2017 during the validation study indicated that photon penetration can drop rapidly immediately under these floating mats however it is complicated to estimate these effects in situ as sea lettuce in these estuaries is free floating in the water and subject to displacement by currents and wind water turbidity may also be relevant at some times of the year following intense precipitations and may be considered to attenuate light intensity concentration of chlorophyll a varies in time and with environmental conditions such as light intensity and nutrient concentrations bischof et al 2002 figueroa et al 2009 in this model the density of photosynthetic units d p s was kept constant for simplicity but more precise predictions might require taking into account this physiological plasticity faugeras et al 2004 indeed the capacity of macroalgae to adjust the concentration sensitivity of photoreceptors might mitigate the effects of self shading up to a certain point lorena et al 2010 discussed these implications for a microalgae deb model and suggested to consider an additional structure if one was to model photoacclimation 4 3 model validation and ecological implications as this model was calibrated using experimental data processes such as grazing or drifting were included after the calibration of model parameters through a stress function aiming at reducing sea lettuce biomass although sea lettuce can attach to various substrates rock wood metal shells via a small disc holdfast it is mostly found drifting in the water column in the studied area likely due to the soft nature of the bottom sand or mud mostly thalli may thus drift freely in the water column forced by wind and currents and accumulate in areas such as the head of estuaries or small embayments drifting may have two consequences on modelled sea lettuce dynamics i the underestimation of sea lettuce biomass at the peak of production in july august when precipitation is low and river flow is reduced leading to a rather stagnant system where sea lettuce accumulates on the sides of the estuaries and ii the overestimation of biomass at the end of the growing season in september october when sea lettuce becomes more subject to drifting possibly due to increased river flow and wind coupling to a spatialized hydrodynamic model in which wind and current dispersal effects are accounted for would address these issues the addition of the stress function to the model must temper our confidence in the validation process and more robust validation is therefore necessary which could be obtained with the use of observed data at the individual scale through mesocosm experiments in coastal and estuarine systems the importance of macroalgae in nutrient cycling is well known hanisak 1993 human et al 2015 lanari et al 2017 however data on the rate of decomposition of sea lettuce thalli are rare hanisak 1993 it is commonly accepted that opportunistic algae developed physiological strategies through evolution allowing them to grow and reproduce quickly and resist stress lenzi et al 2015 low maintenance costs result in more energy allocated to the building of structure and the low value of maintenance parameters in our model j e n m 6 7 10 4 moln molv 1 h 1 j e c m 1 6 10 4 molc molv 1 h 1 reflect this characteristic these values are much lower than those estimated for the phytoplankton species thalassiosira weissflogii 1 2 10 2 moln molv 1 h 1 and 5 4 10 2 molc g 1 h 1 lorena et al 2010 however because the starvation experiment was conducted in controlled conditions excluding grazers and bacterial degradation the measured rate of decomposition as weight loss should be regarded as a minimum estimation compared to the rapid degradation sometimes observed in the wild lenzi et al 2015 reports of excessive nutrient runoff leading to blooms of primary producers in coastal areas around the world are accumulating glibert 2016 liu et al 2016 the aftermath of such productivity can lead to hypoxia or anoxia which may result in die off of fauna and other ecological consequences giordani et al 1996 coffin et al 2018a b while better practices in nutrient runoff management remain paramount to limit the effects of coastal eutrophication there is growing interest in developing commercial usages of sea lettuce for example as part of integrated aquaculture frameworks hadley et al 2015 animal feed bansemer et al 2016 bio fuels barbot et al 2016 or in biochemical applications e g crop fertilizer which might help mitigating these effects because the development of macroalgae in estuaries effectively traps catchment derived nutrients the export of nitrogen to deeper and more open waters can be reduced woodland et al 2015 xiao et al 2017 on prince edward island a pilot study investigating the feasibility of a removal program of sea lettuce in local bays highlighted the technical difficulty and high cost of such an enterprise especially considering that the macroalgal populations can double in size in just a few days crane and ramsay 2012 the current model constitutes a tool that may be useful in some of these applications especially regarding nutrient cycling and growth predictions 5 conclusions in this study we presented the first comprehensive deb model for a macroalgal species a mechanistic model that we successfully validated in field conditions while model improvements are always possible the agreement between model predictions and observed data in the field is remarkable especially considering that the parameter values of the ulva deb model did not result from any statistical optimization procedure further validation should be conducted by testing the applicability of the model to other locations the inclusion of other nutrient sources such as phosphorus may help capture more variability in sea lettuce biomass and should be tested in malpeque bay as well as in other locations depending on the characteristics of these new environments another important validation step is the application of this model to other macroalgal species which is being addressed in an ongoing study on the sugar kelp saccharina latissima in narraganset bay rhode island usa collaboration with a humphries university of rhode island further refinement of these models will serve to prove the benefit of using mechanistic models such as those based on deb theory because sea lettuce develops in shallow embayments and estuaries its impact on nutrient cycling is direct the quantification of this impact through a process based model offers an opportunity to better understand and predict the dynamics of coastal systems potential interactions with the phytoplankton community and impacts on shellfish production in malpeque bay have been hypothesized by filgueira et al 2015 these questions are currently being investigated using the present deb model within the modelling framework designed by these authors lavaud et al in prep such approaches combining physiological processes at the individual level population dynamics and inter specific interactions at the scale of the ecosystem are hoped to help us predict the impacts of future changes on these systems which ultimately inform estuarine planning and management declaration of competing interest the

24913,species distribution models sdm are frequently used in ecological research but the effects of model extent and granularity on model outcomes are rarely addressed in freshwater sdms two different approaches are commonly used to define the granularity of the models i e to subdivide entire river systems into appropriate spatial modelling units river reaches on the actual river network or subcatchments we built maximum entropy maxent sdms for barbel barbus barbus and grayling thymallus thymallus in the river ruhr catchment in germany with identical environmental predictor data and analysed the difference between these two approaches all models performed well auc 0 9 and geographic predictors e g distance to the river source dominated over hydromorphological predictors in explaining species distributions there was high agreement between the two model setups in river parts of low and high habitat suitability but considerably lower agreement in river parts of medium habitat suitability in these medium suitable river parts model results were spatially very heterogeneous and alternated at fine spatial scales especially in models based on river reaches increasing model regularization a setting to control overfitting had a smoothing effect on the environmental variables in the river reach models similar to the coarser subcatchment granularity a restriction of the spatial extent led to a shift in predictor contributions to the model and an increase of the importance of hydromorphologic predictors by ca 45 restricting the model extend to the natural core distributional area of a given fish species might therefore be considered beneficial for the application of sdms in a management context by decreasing the weight of fixed geographic predictors in the model predictors relating to hydromorphological river structures i e which are accessible for restoration projects gain importance we conclude that sdm setups based on river reaches and subcatchments can both give valuable complementary information about the distribution of species the high resolution model based on river reaches might better discover individual local habitat features whereas the subcatchment model might better account for the minimum spatial requirements of a fish population keywords species distribution models scales maxent regularization multiplier 1 introduction natural systems are linked by processes acting at multiple spatial scales e g wiens 1989 maurer 1999 winsor et al 2006 thus analyses of ecological data in a spatial context require to explicitly define 1 the extent of a study area and 2 its granularity i e spatial resolution both aspects extent and granularity frame the spatial scale of a study elith and leathwick 2009 and depend on the research question and study organism they might further be co determined by data availability when studying riverine ecosystems it is particularly important to consider their unique hierarchical nature and spatial scales parsons and thoms 2007 and their corresponding spatially discrete units in stream systems microhabitat reach catchment that shape ecological processes and structure species distributions frissell et al 1986 domisch et al 2015 gurnell et al 2016 scales in riverine ecosystems are nested and typically range from small scale microhabitats to reaches segments catchments basins and to continental or global scales domisch et al 2015 furthermore scales in riverine ecosystems are not only hierarchically organized they also interact in that larger scale processes can influence smaller scale properties for example climate and topography influence sedimentation rates at the smaller river reach scale and land use in the catchment might affect vegetation and or stream communities at local sites frissell et al 1986 understanding relevant spatial scales of environmental and biotic processes and their interaction is highly important to improve our understanding of the spatial distribution of species species distribution models sdm relate the occurrence or abundance of a species to environmental properties to define a species ecological niche or habitat these species environment relationships are commonly used to i predict suitable habitats ii identify the most important ecological drivers for species and iii simulate effects of potential habitat changes e g related to climate and or land use change or restoration protection measures sdms have been widely applied in ecological research and management in various contexts guisan and thuiller 2005 elith and

macroinvertebrates due to global change bond et al 2011 domisch et al 2011 pletterbauer et al 2016 radinger et al 2016 2017b they have been further used to plan and prioritize protected river networks esselman and allan 2011 moilanen et al 2008 and to analyse the distribution of non native species radinger et al 2019a modelling species distributions in river systems needs careful consideration of the peculiarities of these systems i e their directional and hierarchical nature and their large heterogeneity domisch et al 2015 sdms are typically built for one scale at a time that is for one extent and with one spatial resolution granularity the scale affects the informative content and relevance of environmental predictors in the model dormann 2007 domisch et al 2015 for example models covering large e g global regional extents commonly reflect large scale species environment relationships e g those related to climatic patterns models at catchment level however will consider land use and hydromorphological parameters e g stream width or dead wood accumulations as important predictors of species distribution models with only superordinate large scale predictors neglect the small scale heterogeneity of rivers and will likely overestimate species distributions poff 1997 lake et al 2007 however only including site scale predictors ignores overall environmental suitability e g related to climatic constraints of an area domisch et al 2015 sdms analysing the same model organism but with different extents might therefore lead to different results thuiller et al 2003 hence choosing an extent and relevant predictors appropriate to the model organism and the study question is crucial overly constraining the extent can furthermore lead to truncated response curves and possibly misleading results as only a part of a relevant environmental gradient might have been covered van horn 2002 granularity of sdms is often simply determined by data availability sdms usually require all predictors to have an identical resolution scaling down coarse data to be compatible with high resolution data is possible but might produce uncertainties in model results because they are contributing to the model on a scale which they have not been originally assessed at on the other hand predictors can also be too finely grained to produce ecologically meaningful results causing an overemphasis on particularly high values of single habitat characteristics when modelling species distributions in river systems granularity i e the spatial modelling unit can be defined in two ways i as river reaches of the actual river network rn where each reach holds its own environmental information or ii as subcatchments sc of unique water flow and accumulation for the latter environmental information is commonly provided for single raster cells that form a particular subcatchment the choice of this spatial discretisation i e how to spatially characterize a modelling unit constitutes a fundamental decision when modelling species distributions to which all environmental predictors have to be tailored to modelling based on river reaches might require less data preparation as such data are often available via national river habitat assessments e g gellert et al 2014 modelling based on subcatchments as spatial units and extracting corresponding environmental data can be more tedious however the subcatchment approach might provide certain advantages as it is easier to allocate terrestrial processes and inputs from the respective subcatchment areas to certain river reaches additionally using sc as modelling units provides the advantage to more easily include aggregated environmental parameters upstream a river reach in the models to reflect that fish communities are not only affected by local conditions kuemmerlen et al 2014 kail et al 2015 so far previous studies have either used the rn e g domisch et al 2011 radinger et al 2017b or the sc e g hermoso et al 2011 domisch et al 2019 modelling approach but comparative studies examining the consequences of the choice of spatial units in riverine species distribution modelling are sparse but see radinger et al 2015 the overall aim of this study was to investigate the influence of the characterization of the spatial unit i e the rn vs sc modelling approach on the outcome of fish species distribution models

radinger and wolter 2015 we analysed differences between models based on a reach rn vs a subcatchment sc characterisation of the study river system and for two spatial extents entire ruhr catchment vs natural core distributional area of the species we hypothesize that model results will be similar regarding the general larger scale spatial patterns of habitat suitability but differ more in detail i e specific projected occurrences and increasing differences in suitable rivers by restricting the extent of the study area we hypothesize that small scale predictors will increase in importance which will lead to overall larger differences between the rn based and sc based sdms furthermore we evaluated the effect of the model regularization parameter so called beta parameter of the software maxent an internal function to control overfitting by smoothening environmental predictors to partly relax a species relationship with a particular environmental parameter surprisingly sdm studies rarely adjusted the default beta values morales et al 2017 although several studies indicated that tuning of the default values can result in improved maxent models radosavljevic et al 2014 anderson and gonzalez 2011 we hypothesize that increased beta parameter values reduce a model s dependency on the choice of the spatial discretisation and that increased beta parameter values in the rn based sdms will lead to higher conformity with the sc based sdms 2 methods 2 1 study river catchment the study was conducted in the river ruhr catchment 4 478 km² 51 12 48 51 27 3 n 8 33 28 6 43 23 e located in north rhine westphalia germany fig 1 the river is approximately 219 km long and discharges on average 80 m³ s into the river rhine the eastern headwater part of the catchment area is characterized by agriculture and forestry while the most western part is characterized by urban and industrial land use ruhr metropolitan area about 5 million inhabitants 2 2 environmental data and spatial discretization for the subsequent models we compiled a candidate predictor set of 39 environmental variables table s1 measured hydromorphological habitat variables n 35 were obtained from a state wide assessment of the hydromorphological status of the rivers lawa 2000 the data contained information about the river course longitudinal profile riverbed structure cross section profile riparian structure and river environment on 50 500 m long river reaches lawa 2000 as hydromorphological data were only available for rivers with a catchment 10km² smaller tributaries were excluded from our analyses in addition to the hydromorphological data we computed geographic predictors n 4 for each spatial unit based on a 25 25 digital elevation model dem bundesamt für kartographie und geodäsie bkg 2007 geographic predictors were distance to source distance to mouth elevation and slope we considered two spatial discretizations of our models 1 first an approach that is based on river reaches 50 500 m of the river network rn obtained as vector gis layers from the state agency for nature environment and consumer protection in north rhine westphalia lanuv nrw and 2 second an approach that is based on subcatchments sc for the sc model we divided the entire basin into discrete hydrological subunits i e subcatchments using the gis software arcmap 10 5 with the archydro extension based on a 25 25 m dem bundesamt für kartographie und geodäsie bkg 2007 in a first step we filled sinks and calculated the water flow direction for every raster cell subsequently we calculated accumulated water flow for each raster cell and delineated the subcatchments based on a threshold of minimum 300 cells 0 1875 km2 of accumulated waterflow to improve the accuracy of subcatchment delineation the existing stream network was burned into the dem using the burn stream slope function in arcgis esri 2011 this function lowers elevation values of cells along the provided stream network to force the direction of flow along the stream network in total 4231 model relevant subcatchments were delineated with an average size of 0 38 sd 0 34 km² and an average river length of 438 sd 464 m although both the rn and sc model considered the same predictor variables their extraction was methodologically different for the rn models hydromorphological data were normalized to average values per 100 m stream length e g number of cascades per 100 m for the sc models we calculated mean values of the continuous data normalized per 100 m river e g the distance to the river source the number of pools per 100 m etc for each subcatchment for categorical data e g riverbed structure the mode of each variable within a given subcatchment was considered calculations of the mean respectively mode over a given sc result in the spatial smoothing of the environmental variables mean and mode were only calculated for scs with sufficient data availability for a particular environmental variable 50 of the river within a sc holding information on a particular variable otherwise the sc was considered missing information on that variable if a 100 m or 500 m survey unit from the hydromorphological assessment crossed subcatchment boundaries data were split proportionally between the two subcatchments in subsequent steps we evaluated and quantified the agreement between the two methods of variable extraction specifically for metrically scaled environmental variables we correlated their values of the dataset for the sc vs the rn model using spearman s rank correlations we further investigated whether spatially very heterogeneous variables i e those including many zero values like numerous hydromorphological variables were specifically affected by the smoothing as introduced in the sc approach therefore we correlated spearman the percentage of zero values of each environmental variable with its correlation coefficient from the previous step describing the agreement between the sc and rn approach 2 3 species occurrence records fish sampling data were provided by the state agency for nature environment and consumer protection lanuv north rhine westphalia and comprised of occurrence data obtained by electrofishing average sampling length of 310 m min 20 m max 1000 m sd 170 m between 2000 and 2017 for our analyses we selected barbel barbus barbus 70 occurrence points and grayling thymallus thymallus 168 occurrence points as model fish species fig 1 occurrence data were considered as presence only data i e no true absences inferred as the detection based on electrofishing may be imperfect reid and haxton 2017 radinger et al 2019b for subcatchments with multiple occurrence records of the same species only a single record was considered i e we only characterized if a species is present in a subcatchment or not resulting in slightly smaller numbers of occurrences 58 barbel and 130 grayling occurrences compared to the rn models 2 4 species distribution model setup and evaluation species distributions for barbel and grayling and both characterizations of the spatial unit rn and sc were modelled using the software maxent version 3 4 1 phillips et al 2006 to achieve parsimonious models we removed all predictors not contributing considerably to the model in a stepwise approach first we excluded highly correlated predictors spearman s rho 0 8 dormann et al 2013 then we performed two model runs and removed predictors with 1 percent contribution pc and 1 percent permutation importance pi as provided by maxent phillips et al 2006 pc is heuristically defined and reflects the increase in the gain of the model that maxent assigns to a given environmental variable pi depends on the final maxent model and is determined by randomly permuting the values of that variable among the training points both presence and background and measuring the resulting decrease in training auc phillips 2006 for further interpretation of the importance of a variable we focussed on the percent contribution pc of each variable to the single models unless otherwise mentioned we used the default settings elith et al 2011 that are based on thorough testing phillips and dudík 2008 and cloglog output phillips et al 2017 to test for model predictive accuracy we used a model internal 5 fold cross validation occurrence data were divided into five equal parts of which four parts were used for model training and one part left out for testing this was repeated 5 times so that every part served as test data once the model s overall performance was evaluated using the threshold independent auc area under curve scores of the receiver operating characteristic roc plots fielding and bell 1997 auc scores of 1 indicate that the model predicts true presences perfectly whereas 0 5 indicates that it is no better than random in addition we modified the regularization multiplier so called beta parameter within maxent maxent includes environmental predictors as dependencies of different complexity so called features the beta parameter limits this complexity and relaxes the constraints used in the modelling process by penalizing complex features and hence prevents the model to fit predictors too tightly which might otherwise cause an overfit of the model phillips et al 2006 phillips and dudík 2008 for a more detailed description of the beta parameter see e g merow et al 2013 here we analysed the effect of the regularization multiplier on both model approaches by setting up identical models with beta parameter values of 1 default 2 3 6 and 10 we performed wilcoxon signed rank tests to assess the differences between the sc and rn models when increasing the beta parameter value in the rn models while keeping the beta parameter fixed at the default value of 1 in the sc models we calculated friedman rank sum tests and conover posthoc tests r package pmcmrplus version 1 4 1 pohlert 2018 to analyse if the choice of beta parameter value affected the observed differences between the models to investigate effects of the spatial extent of the study area we distinguished between two model setups 1 models built for the entire ruhr catchment from the previous steps and additionally 2 models with a restricted spatial extent comprising only of selected river sections along the longitudinal continuum reflecting the natural distributional area of a given species the spatial extent practically sets the limits of the background area i e the area from where pseudo absences used in the maxent models can be drawn in practice the full extent and restricted extent models used different sets of pseudo absences for model building the delineation of the natural distributional area of a given fish species was based on natural reference communities of the individual river sections species specific stream typology https www flussgebiete nrw de fischgewaessertypen 5585 these reference fish communities are based on historical distribution data and expert knowledge about species habitat requirements and are part of the eu water framework directive compliant assessment of the ecological status of rivers by restricting the study extent to the natural species specific area closer boundaries to the environmental gradients are used in the models fig 1 from both extents of the study area entire ruhr catchment vs natural distributional area of a fish species 10 000 points were randomly sampled as pseudo absences for model fitting the species occurrence data were all located within both study extents that were considered we interpreted maxent results as relative habitat suitability merow et al 2013 ranging from 0 unsuitable to 1 fully suitable for visual presentation continuous habitat suitability was classified into four classes 0 1 unsuitable 0 1 to 0 25 low 0 25 to 0 75 medium and 0 75 high to compare the results between the rn and the sc models we transformed the river network into about 2 4 106 single points projected the rn and sc model results onto these points and calculated the differences between both models at each point a positive difference describes a larger predicted habitat suitability for the sc model a negative difference describes a larger predicted habitat suitability for the rn model for visual presentation we classified the differences into small 0 2 to 0 2 medium 0 6 to 0 2 and 0 2 to 0 6 and large 0 6 and 0 6 differences to test for differences in projected habitat suitability between the models we calculated wilcoxon signed rank tests in order to analyse for relationships between predicted habitat suitability and absolute differences between the rn and the sc models we plotted the data calculated estimated b splines of the conditional quartile functions using the r package quantreg version 5 38 koenker 2018 and compared it to a null model of differences between two sets of random habitat suitabilities the closer real modelled differences i e median solid blue and red line are to the difference of the null models dashed black line the higher the chances that these differences are random we also plotted the absolute difference between the models against the most important environmental variables to examine for potential relationships 3 results all models generally performed well with a 5 fold cross validated mean auc of 0 928 and 0 930 for barbel and 0 902 and 0 895 for grayling in the rn and sc model respectively the predicted distribution patterns were rather similar between the two modelling approaches for both species fig 2 overall the sc model barbel mean habitat suitability 0 078 sd 0 184 grayling mean 0 143 sd 0 246 provided slightly higher suitabilities compared to the rn models barbel mean 0 067 sd 0 166 grayling mean 0 121 sd 0 218 table s2 as indicated by wilcoxon signed rank tests barbel v 1 20 1012 p 0 001 grayling v 1 22 1012 p 0 001 the models predicted the majority of the river reaches between 71 9 and 84 1 as unsuitable for both species suitable habitats suitability 0 2 for barbel were mainly predicted in the main stems of the larger rivers ruhr and lenne fig 2a and b table s2 suitable habitats for grayling were predicted more upstream also including several smaller tributaries fig 2c and d a comparison with the null model allowed identifying areas of highest agreement between the sc and rn models fig 3 while accounting for potential by chance differences from comparing two sets of random habitat suitabilities contrary to our expectations the suitability models differed least at low predicted habitat suitabilities 0 3 fig 3 at medium habitat suitabilities 0 4 0 7 the highest disagreement between both models was observed reaching values close to the difference between two random models at high predicted habitat suitabilities 0 8 the differences were again lower especially in barbel while differences increased again towards perfectly suitable habitat in grayling the different extraction approaches for environmental variables rn and sc the latter introducing subcatchment smoothing led to differences in the environmental predictor sets that were used in the respective habitat suitability models for some variables for example distance to source the extraction approach did not entail differences between environmental predictors spearman rho 1 p 0 001 the lowest match between environmental predictors extracted with the rn and sc approach was found for the variable dead channel rho 0 43 p 0 001 table s3 a correlation analysis revealed a strong negative relationship between the number of zeros in an environmental predictor and the agreement between both methods of extraction rho 0 95 p 0 001 reflecting that the sc extraction approach led to smoothing especially in patchily distributed highly localized environmental structures the predicted habitat suitabilities alternated at fine spatial scales especially in areas of medium and high habitat suitability fig 4 differences in predicted habitat suitability between the two models rn and sc did not vary systematically with gradients of environmental predictors fig 5 regarding variable importance geographic predictors were the most important predictor group contributing in total between 74 6 and 84 4 to the models the group of hydromorphological predictors generally contributed less however their contribution was slightly higher in the rn compared to the sc models table 1 from the geographic predictors distance to source was by far the most important predictor in all models contributing to 62 1 72 8 bankfull cross section width was the most important hydromorphological predictor and the only present in all models followed by flow variation and cross section width variability other predictors contributed less to the models table 1 the number of predictors used in the final models differed while the five geographic predictors were considered important across all models a slightly higher number of hydromorphological predictors 15 vs 11 and 12 vs 9 for the barbel and grayling models respectively were selected in the rn models compared to the sc models 3 1 regularization multiplier increasing the beta parameter value in the rn models led to a smoothing of predicted habitat suitabilities across small spatial scales fig s1 moreover increased beta parameter values were associated with an increase in mean and median habitat suitabilities response curves from the sensitivity analysis of the maxent models showed changes in predicted habitat suitability across the gradient of a given predictor fig 6 an increase in the beta parameter value led to smoother responses up to a level where a predictor no longer provided any useful information to the model fig 6 green line such flat response curves lead to predictors being neglected in the model building process resulting in models with very few remaining predictors table 2 exemplary for grayling river network model at a beta value of 10 it was mainly the predictors distance to source elevation and slope that remained informative to the models for the sc models smoothing was already performed during the variable extraction therefore the sc models had generally lower predictor values compared to the rn models e g max 17 vs 5 cascades per 100 m river reach fig 6 left generally and irrespective of the choice of the beta value 1 2 3 6 or 10 in the rn models differences between the rn models and the sc models with the default beta parameter value of 1 were statistically clear although minor in size wilcoxon signed rank tests all p 0 001 for both species a beta value of 1 and 2 in the rn model minimized the median differences between the rn and the sc model and the dispersion in model differences larger beta values in the rn models were associated with larger median differences between the rn and sc model in both species fig s2 3 2 consequences of the extent of the study catchment restricting the spatial extent of the models to the natural distributional area of a given fish species caused a decline in the auc from 0 93 to 0 69 barbel and 0 90 to 0 80 grayling across both model setups compared to the full extent models mean predicted habitat suitabilities changed only slightly for the barbel models from 0 32 sd 0 27 to 0 30 sd 0 25 and 0 28 sd 0 26 to 0 21 sd 0 22 for the sc and rn approach respectively for the grayling models mean habitat suitabilities changed from 0 29 sd 0 29 to 0 26 sd 0 28 and 0 24 sd 0 26 to 0 21 sd 0 24 for the sc and rn approach respectively wilcoxon signed rank tests indicated statistically clear differences between the full extent and restricted extent models for barbel sc v 6 932 p 0 001 rn v 6 231 p 0 001 and grayling sc v 3 523 p 0 001 rn v 3 377 p 0 001 but differences appeared small fig s3 both the rn and sc model based on a restricted extent selected more predictor variables compared to their equivalent model based on the entire catchment area table 3 in the restricted extent models geographic predictors contributed about 45 less to explain species distributions compared to the models that used the entire catchment while the importance of hydromorphological predictors increased for barbel the predictors flow variation depth variability and cross section depth showed the greatest gains for grayling cross section width variability and bankfull cross section width gained most importance in the models with a restricted extent 4 discussion the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of different spatial scales of environmental predictors i e their granularity and overall spatial extent in a maxent sdm for two river fish species high auc values indicated the successful modelling of the distribution of both considered species the general patterns of modelled distributions followed our expectations of high habitat suitabilities in rivers where the respective species are considered an indicator species fish stream type classification see fig 1 generally the sdms predicted spatially very heterogeneous patterns of habitat suitabilities even within a species core distributional area the observed patchiness of habitats is considered a natural feature of highly heterogeneous river systems that are typically dynamic in space and time e g vannote et al 1980 fausch et al 2002 thorp et al 2006 thus multiple conceptual models have been developed to understand how ecological processes and populations are affected by this heterogeneity and dynamic see winemiller et al 2010 for example fausch et al 2002 proposed an integrative view on rivers specifically to aid stream fish conservation efforts remarking that scientist too often focus on small scale single river reaches thereby ignoring the overall complexity and continuous as well as hierarchical nature of rivers they argue that effective research and management of stream fishes have to consider the stream network as a dynamic landscape providing fish habitats for moving fish and for different life stages consequently sdms such as those developed in this study can help to understand the underlying mechanisms of species distribution at different scales and hence aid river restoration or fish conservation measures for example sdms with coarse resolution might reveal relevant effects of stream temperature whereas finer resolution models given sufficient data at high spatial resolution might reveal the importance of small scale habitat structures detecting the heterogeneity of habitat patches is also important with regard to fish movement ecology and the functional connectivity of rivers for example when an unsuitable reach within an otherwise suitable river possibly forms a barrier for movement and migration fuller et al 2015 radinger et al 2017a thus small but highly suitable patches might provide essential stepping stone habitats and thereby contribute to the improvement of connectivity which is a major restoration goal of riverine ecosystems 4 1 differences between the model setups overall our results revealed high conformity between the rn and sc model setups as hypothesized differences between both models were particularly high in reaches of medium habitat suitability there is high agreement in unsuitable areas but a closer look at areas of medium and high suitability revealed details of the differences between both modelling approaches within the larger subcatchments of uniform habitat suitability the river network model resulted in fine scaled alternating habitat suitability patterns especially in rivers of medium habitat suitability increases in difference between models towards high habitat suitabilities specifically for grayling could be explained by small scale hydromorphological predictors which are smoothened in the sc but not the rn modelling approach incision depth and instream islands for example were important in the grayling but not the barbel models grayling is also known to be more stationary whereas barbel is more mobile and might therefore be less connected to specific small scale habitat structures the model setups yielded only minor differences in the auc of the models hence auc did not allow for a general inference which of the setups produced better results at the catchment scale maxent s analysis of predictor contribution showed a clear dominance of broad geographic predictors especially the distance to river source largely contributed to the explaining of the distributions of barbel and grayling these variables reflect the overall location of a given site within the longitudinal continuum of a river network which in turn is correlated with habitat attributes such as water temperature flow velocity oxygen content and substrate see river continuum concept rcc vannote et al 1980 these attributes could not explicitly be included as predictors in our models due to insufficient data the two fish species modelled in this study are eponymous for two fish zones along this longitudinal gradient the barbel zone in the upper potamal and the grayling in the lower rhitral zone huet 1949 aarts and nienhuis 2003 the geographic predictors that dominate in each model mirror these general zones well and so do the results with high habitat suitabilites in the according river sections the hydromorphological predictors follow then at a subordinate level in a hierarchical filtering process to form local species assemblages poff 1997 lake et al 2007 we did not identify any specific environmental predictors as responsible for differences between the rn and sc models one potential reason might be the dominance of geographic predictors that were of similar importance in both model setups local inconsistencies seemed to be related to the patchy patterns of some environmental predictors with locally high variable values for example in the rn models dead channels only existed in 2 8 of all river reaches but with numbers of up to 20 dead channels per 100 m these high values are less well represented in the sc models as they are smoothed to lower average values for an entire subcatchment this leads for example to a higher percentage of 14 1 of subcatchments having dead channels but with a lower count of maximum 5 0 dead channels per 100 m this might explain why hydromorphological predictors are better represented in the rn setup than in the sc setup that being said in case the specific numbers of certain channel features are of particular ecological relevance for a species the rn setup might be the better choice as it avoids predictor smoothing compared to the sc model on the other hand if important predictors hold many gaps or the sheer existence of a channel feature is essential then the sc setup might lead to better results it was beyond the scope of our study to explicitly examine whether it is the number of hydromorphological features or rather their existence that is most influential on the distribution patterns of the two modelled species using the highest spatial resolution possible does not necessarily lead to higher quality results also because fish are generally mobile and might utilize several habitats along the river course populations need a certain extent of suitable habitat to maintain their resilience a specific number of fragmented instream channel features in a single river reach might be less important to maintain viable populations compared to the overall characteristic of multiple adjacent reaches along the longitudinal continuum radinger et al 2015 that is especially true if we take into account that point occurrence data of generally mobile organisms such as most fishes might capture only a snapshot in space and time it must also be taken into account that fish are sampled along river reaches of variable length which might not necessarily agree with the spatial granularity of a species distribution model for river management both model setups cover complementary important information a spatial resolution of few hundred meters river reaches is able to identify individual habitat features that can be vital for a certain species and or life stage modelling approaches building on such high resolution data can show ecological deficits or impediments for the occurrence of the modelled species discovering such local features in a species distribution model can contribute to the prioritization of restoration sites a model on a coarser scale better accounts for the minimum spatial requirements of a fish population a suitable but short reach in an otherwise unsuitable river might not be sufficient for a species to sustain a fine scale rn model could be used to identify structural problems that lead to small scale habitat degradations that affect the bigger picture that is provided by the sc model 4 2 regularization multiplier our results revealed that increasing the beta parameter relaxes the constraints imposed by the environmental predictors on the model which can in turn facilitate the comparison of models based on different spatial units overall predicted habitat suitabilities increased with increasing beta making the model more generalizable at the cost of reduced accuracy as response curves became smoother fig s1 nevertheless auc scores hence the ability of the model to predict the test data with the training data were high and did not indicate overfitted models transferring and testing the models in a different catchment would then be a next step to assess model validity however this was beyond the scope of this study as hypothesized our results showed that an increase of the beta parameter value in the rn models leads to a higher conformity with the subcatchment models increasing the beta parameter value has a similar effect like the smoothing of predictors however it might also cause local habitat features being erased from the model building process which would make a model overly general and only considering superordinate predictors e g climate and hydrology consequently for future applications of the maxent sdm software we emphasize the importance of testing a set of multiple regularization multipliers beta values and selecting the most appropriate based on model evaluation e g using cross validation however choosing the optimal regularization parameter value is not trivial laborious tuning experiments morales et al 2017 radosavljevic et al 2014 merow et al 2013 are considered the only way to find the optimum a suite of tools that can support this process is enmtools warren et al 2010 4 3 restricting the extent of the study area omitting generally unsuitable parts of the river network by restricting the modelling background domain i e the area from which pseudo absences can be selected to a species core area of distribution e g fish zone led to a notably decrease in the auc score of the model this is not surprising since unsuitable areas are excluded that were otherwise predicted correctly as unsuitable by the models that means extending a study area by including unsuitable habitat outside its general distributional area or choosing an unreasonably large study area is likely to increase the auc making the model seemingly better than it is the dependence of the auc on the choice of the geographic extent of a study has been described before e g lobo et al 2008 hence comparing model accuracy between different species that naturally have different areas of occurrence it is prone to bias this also prevented us from directly comparing the auc of our full extent models with those of restricted extent restricting the extent of the study area also changed the environmental predictors contributions to the model as hypothesized local hydromorphological predictors gained importance in the restricted extent models compared to the models covering the full study area the geographic predictors especially distance to source decreased in their dominance because the longitudinal location within the river network was already restricted to areas of relative suitability following the hierarchical filtering concept poff 1997 hydromorphological predictors should then gain importance which was also indicated by our results 4 4 implications for conservation and management overall sdms can provide valuable information about the potential distribution of species thereby helping to prioritize conservation areas sánchez cordero et al 2005 designing protected areas for target species esselman and allan 2011 moilanen et al 2008 and or improving our understanding of global change induced distributional shifts e g radinger et al 2017b bond et al 2011 for river restoration projects sdms can provide valuable information about structural elements that are particularly important for a given species and thereby help to optimize and prioritize restoration measures and sites we argue that for these purposes models that incorporate hydromorphological predictors and those that are trained at ecologically relevant study extents are particularly useful as such models can inform about the small scale heterogeneity of habitats both model setups either based on actual river reaches or subcatchments provide important information that is complementary for management and conservation a spatial resolution of river reaches of few hundred meters is able to identify individual habitat features that can be vital for a certain species and or life stage hence modelling approaches building on such high resolution data allow showing ecological deficits or impediments for the occurrence of the modelled species discovering such local features in a species distribution model can contribute to the prioritization of restoration sites models on a coarser scale however might better account for the minimum spatial requirements of a fish population and allow

24913,species distribution models sdm are frequently used in ecological research but the effects of model extent and granularity on model outcomes are rarely addressed in freshwater sdms two different approaches are commonly used to define the granularity of the models i e to subdivide entire river systems into appropriate spatial modelling units river reaches on the actual river network or subcatchments we built maximum entropy maxent sdms for barbel barbus barbus and grayling thymallus thymallus in the river ruhr catchment in germany with identical environmental predictor data and analysed the difference between these two approaches all models performed well auc 0 9 and geographic predictors e g distance to the river source dominated over hydromorphological predictors in explaining species distributions there was high agreement between the two model setups in river parts of low and high habitat suitability but considerably lower agreement in river parts of medium habitat suitability in these medium suitable river parts model results were spatially very heterogeneous and alternated at fine spatial scales especially in models based on river reaches increasing model regularization a setting to control overfitting had a smoothing effect on the environmental variables in the river reach models similar to the coarser subcatchment granularity a restriction of the spatial extent led to a shift in predictor contributions to the model and an increase of the importance of hydromorphologic predictors by ca 45 restricting the model extend to the natural core distributional area of a given fish species might therefore be considered beneficial for the application of sdms in a management context by decreasing the weight of fixed geographic predictors in the model predictors relating to hydromorphological river structures i e which are accessible for restoration projects gain importance we conclude that sdm setups based on river reaches and subcatchments can both give valuable complementary information about the distribution of species the high resolution model based on river reaches might better discover individual local habitat features whereas the subcatchment model might better account for the minimum spatial requirements of a fish population keywords species distribution models scales maxent regularization multiplier 1 introduction natural systems are linked by processes acting at multiple spatial scales e g wiens 1989 maurer 1999 winsor et al 2006 thus analyses of ecological data in a spatial context require to explicitly define 1 the

frissell et al 1986 domisch et al 2015 gurnell et al 2016 scales in riverine ecosystems are nested and typically range from small scale microhabitats to reaches segments catchments basins and to continental or global scales domisch et al 2015 furthermore scales in riverine ecosystems are not only hierarchically organized they also interact in that larger scale processes can influence smaller scale properties for example climate and topography influence sedimentation rates at the smaller river reach scale and land use in the catchment might affect vegetation and or stream communities at local sites frissell et al 1986 understanding relevant spatial scales of environmental and biotic processes and their interaction is highly important to improve our understanding of the spatial

esselman and allan 2011 moilanen et al 2008 and to analyse the distribution of non native species radinger et al 2019a modelling species distributions in river systems needs careful consideration of the peculiarities of these systems i e their directional and hierarchical nature and their large heterogeneity domisch et al 2015 sdms are typically built for one scale at a time that is for one extent and with one spatial resolution granularity the scale affects the informative content and relevance of environmental predictors in the model dormann 2007 domisch et al 2015 for example models covering large e g global regional extents commonly reflect large scale species environment relationships e g those related to climatic patterns models at catchment level however will consider land use and hydromorphological parameters e g stream width or dead wood accumulations as important predictors of species distribution models with only superordinate large scale predictors neglect the small scale heterogeneity of rivers and will likely overestimate species distributions poff 1997 lake et al 2007 however only including site scale predictors ignores overall environmental suitability e g related to climatic constraints of an area domisch et al 2015 sdms analysing the same model organism but with different extents might therefore lead to different results thuiller et al 2003 hence choosing an extent and relevant predictors appropriate to the model organism and the study question is crucial overly constraining the extent can furthermore lead to truncated response curves and possibly misleading results as only a part of a relevant environmental gradient might have been covered van horn 2002 granularity of sdms is often simply determined by data availability sdms usually require all predictors to have an identical resolution scaling down coarse data to be compatible with high resolution data is possible but might produce uncertainties in model results because they are contributing to the model on a scale which they have not been originally assessed at on the other hand predictors can also be too finely grained to produce ecologically meaningful results causing an overemphasis on particularly high values of single habitat characteristics when modelling species distributions in river systems granularity i e the spatial modelling unit can be defined in two ways i as river reaches of the actual river network rn where each reach holds its own environmental information or ii as subcatchments sc of unique water flow and accumulation for the latter environmental information is commonly provided for single raster cells that form a particular subcatchment the choice of this spatial discretisation i e how to spatially characterize a modelling unit constitutes a fundamental decision when modelling species distributions to which all environmental predictors have to be tailored to modelling based on river reaches might require less data preparation as such data are often available via national river habitat assessments e g gellert et al 2014 modelling based on subcatchments as spatial units and extracting corresponding environmental data can be more tedious however the subcatchment approach might provide certain advantages as it is easier to allocate terrestrial processes and inputs from the respective subcatchment areas to certain river reaches additionally using sc as modelling units provides the advantage to more easily include aggregated environmental parameters upstream a river reach in the models to reflect that fish communities are not only affected by local conditions kuemmerlen et al 2014 kail et al 2015 so far previous studies have either used the rn e g domisch et al 2011 radinger et al 2017b or the sc e g hermoso et al 2011 domisch et al 2019 modelling approach but comparative studies examining the consequences of the choice of spatial units in riverine species distribution modelling are sparse but see radinger et al 2015 the overall aim of this study was to investigate the influence of the characterization of the spatial unit i e the rn vs sc modelling approach on the outcome of fish species distribution models specifically we built sdms using the maximum entropy model maxent phillips et al 2006 for two fish species barbel barbus barbus and grayling thymallus thymallus in the river ruhr catchment in germany maxent is one of the most frequently used sdm algorithms merow et al 2013 it can handle missing absences and categorical data and is known to perform well e g elith et al 2006 murphy et al 2015 radinger and wolter 2015 we analysed differences between models based on a reach rn vs a subcatchment sc characterisation of the study river system and for two spatial extents entire ruhr catchment vs natural core distributional area of the species we hypothesize that model results will be similar regarding the general larger scale spatial patterns of habitat suitability but differ more in detail i e specific projected occurrences and increasing differences in suitable rivers by restricting the extent of the study area we hypothesize that small scale predictors will increase in importance which will lead to overall larger differences between the rn based and sc based sdms furthermore we evaluated the effect of the model regularization parameter so called beta parameter of the software maxent an internal function to control overfitting by smoothening environmental predictors to partly relax a species relationship with a particular environmental parameter surprisingly sdm studies rarely adjusted the default beta values morales et al 2017 although several studies indicated that tuning of the default values can result in improved maxent models radosavljevic et al 2014 anderson and gonzalez 2011 we hypothesize that increased beta parameter values reduce a model s dependency on the choice of the spatial discretisation and that increased beta parameter values in the rn based sdms will lead to higher conformity with the sc based sdms 2 methods 2 1 study river catchment the study was conducted in the river ruhr catchment 4 478 km² 51 12 48 51 27 3 n 8 33 28 6 43 23 e located in north rhine westphalia germany fig 1 the river is approximately 219 km long and discharges on average 80 m³ s into the river rhine the eastern headwater part of the catchment area is characterized by agriculture and forestry while the most western part is characterized by urban and industrial land use ruhr metropolitan area about 5 million inhabitants 2 2 environmental data and spatial discretization for the subsequent models we compiled a candidate predictor set of 39 environmental variables table s1 measured hydromorphological habitat variables n 35 were obtained from a state wide assessment of the hydromorphological status of the rivers lawa 2000 the data contained information about the river course longitudinal profile riverbed structure cross section profile riparian structure and river environment on 50 500 m long river reaches lawa 2000 as hydromorphological data were only available for rivers with a catchment 10km² smaller tributaries were excluded from our analyses in addition to the hydromorphological data we computed geographic predictors n 4 for each spatial unit based on a 25 25 digital elevation model dem bundesamt für kartographie und geodäsie bkg 2007 geographic predictors were distance to source distance to mouth elevation and slope we considered two spatial discretizations of our models 1 first an approach that is based on river reaches 50 500 m of the river network rn obtained as vector gis layers from the state agency for nature environment and consumer protection in north rhine westphalia lanuv nrw and 2 second an approach that is based on subcatchments sc for the sc model we divided the entire basin into discrete hydrological subunits i e subcatchments using the gis software arcmap 10 5 with the archydro extension based on a 25 25 m dem bundesamt für kartographie und geodäsie bkg 2007 in a first step we filled sinks and calculated the water flow direction for every raster cell subsequently we calculated accumulated water flow for each raster cell and delineated the subcatchments based on a threshold of minimum 300 cells 0 1875 km2 of accumulated waterflow to improve the accuracy of subcatchment delineation the existing stream network was burned into the dem using the burn stream slope function in arcgis esri 2011 this function lowers elevation values of cells along the provided stream network to force the direction of flow along the stream network in total 4231 model relevant subcatchments were delineated with an average size of 0 38 sd 0 34 km² and an average river length of 438 sd 464 m although both the rn and sc model considered the same predictor variables their extraction was methodologically different for the rn models hydromorphological data were normalized to average values per 100 m stream length e g number of cascades per 100 m for the sc models we calculated mean values of the continuous data normalized per 100 m river e g the distance to the river source the number of pools per 100 m etc for each subcatchment for categorical data e g riverbed structure the mode of each variable within a given subcatchment was considered calculations of the mean respectively mode over a given sc result in the spatial smoothing of the environmental variables mean and mode were only calculated for scs with sufficient data availability for a particular environmental variable 50 of the river within a sc holding information on a particular variable otherwise the sc was considered missing information on that variable if a 100 m or 500 m survey unit from the hydromorphological assessment crossed subcatchment boundaries data were split proportionally between the two subcatchments in subsequent steps we evaluated and quantified the agreement between the two methods of variable extraction specifically for metrically scaled environmental variables we correlated their values of the dataset for the sc vs the rn model using spearman s rank correlations we further investigated whether spatially very heterogeneous variables i e those including many zero values like numerous hydromorphological variables were specifically affected by the smoothing as introduced in the sc approach therefore we correlated spearman the percentage of zero values of each environmental variable with its correlation coefficient from the previous step describing the agreement between the sc and rn approach 2 3 species occurrence records fish sampling data were provided by the state agency for nature environment and consumer protection lanuv north rhine westphalia and comprised of occurrence data obtained by electrofishing average sampling length of 310 m min 20 m max 1000 m sd 170 m between 2000 and 2017 for our analyses we selected barbel barbus barbus 70 occurrence points and grayling thymallus thymallus 168 occurrence points as model fish species fig 1 occurrence data were considered as presence only data i e no true absences inferred as the detection based on electrofishing may be imperfect reid and haxton 2017 radinger et al 2019b for subcatchments with multiple occurrence records of the same species only a single record was considered i e we only characterized if a species is present in a subcatchment or not resulting in slightly smaller numbers of occurrences 58 barbel and 130 grayling occurrences compared to the rn models 2 4 species distribution model setup and evaluation species distributions for barbel and grayling and both characterizations of the spatial unit rn and sc were modelled using the software maxent version 3 4 1 phillips et al 2006 to achieve parsimonious models we removed all predictors not contributing considerably to the model in a stepwise approach first we excluded highly correlated predictors spearman s rho 0 8 dormann et al 2013 then we performed two model runs and removed predictors with 1 percent contribution pc and 1 percent permutation importance pi as provided by maxent phillips et al 2006 pc is heuristically defined and reflects the increase in the gain of the model that maxent assigns to a given environmental variable pi depends on the final maxent model and is determined by randomly permuting the values of that variable among the training points both presence and background and measuring the resulting decrease in training auc phillips 2006 for further interpretation of the importance of a variable we focussed on the percent contribution pc of each variable to the single models unless otherwise mentioned we used the default settings elith et al 2011 that are based on thorough testing phillips and dudík 2008 and cloglog output phillips et al 2017 to test for model predictive accuracy we used a model internal 5 fold cross validation occurrence data were divided into five equal parts of which four parts were used for model training and one part left out for testing this was repeated 5 times so that every part served as test data once the model s overall performance was evaluated using the threshold independent auc area under curve scores of the receiver operating characteristic roc plots fielding and bell 1997 auc scores of 1 indicate that the model predicts true presences perfectly whereas 0 5 indicates that it is no better than random in addition we modified the regularization multiplier so called beta parameter within maxent maxent includes environmental predictors as dependencies of different complexity so called features the beta parameter limits this complexity and relaxes the constraints used in the modelling process by penalizing complex features and hence prevents the model to fit predictors too tightly which might otherwise cause an overfit of the model phillips et al 2006 phillips and dudík 2008 for a more detailed description of the beta parameter see e g merow et al 2013 here we analysed the effect of the regularization multiplier on both model approaches by setting up identical models with beta parameter values of 1 default 2 3 6 and 10 we performed wilcoxon signed rank tests to assess the differences between the sc and rn models when increasing the beta parameter value in the rn models while keeping the beta parameter fixed at the default value of 1 in the sc models we calculated friedman rank sum tests and conover posthoc tests r package pmcmrplus version 1 4 1 pohlert 2018 to analyse if the choice of beta parameter value affected the observed differences between the models to investigate effects of the spatial extent of the study area we distinguished between two model setups 1 models built for the entire ruhr catchment from the previous steps and additionally 2 models with a restricted spatial extent comprising only of selected river sections along the longitudinal continuum reflecting the natural distributional area of a given species the spatial extent practically sets the limits of the background area i e the area from where pseudo absences used in the maxent models can be drawn in practice the full extent and restricted extent models used different sets of pseudo absences for model building the delineation of the natural distributional area of a given fish species was based on natural reference communities of the individual river sections species specific stream typology https www flussgebiete nrw de fischgewaessertypen 5585 these reference fish communities are based on historical distribution data and expert knowledge about species habitat requirements and are part of the eu water framework directive compliant assessment of the ecological status of rivers by restricting the study extent to the natural species specific area closer boundaries to the environmental gradients are used in the models fig 1 from both extents of the study area entire ruhr catchment vs natural distributional area of a fish species 10 000 points were randomly sampled as pseudo absences for model fitting the species occurrence data were all located within both study extents that were considered we interpreted maxent results as relative habitat suitability merow et al 2013 ranging from 0 unsuitable to 1 fully suitable for visual presentation continuous habitat suitability was classified into four classes 0 1 unsuitable 0 1 to 0 25 low 0 25 to 0 75 medium and 0 75 high to compare the results between the rn and the sc models we transformed the river network into about 2 4 106 single points projected the rn and sc model results onto these points and calculated the differences between both models at each point a positive difference describes a larger predicted habitat suitability for the sc model a negative difference describes a larger predicted habitat suitability for the rn model for visual presentation we classified the differences into small 0 2 to 0 2 medium 0 6 to 0 2 and 0 2 to 0 6 and large 0 6 and 0 6 differences to test for differences in projected habitat suitability between the models we calculated wilcoxon signed rank tests in order to analyse for relationships between predicted habitat suitability and absolute differences between the rn and the sc models we plotted the data calculated estimated b splines of the conditional quartile functions using the r package quantreg version 5 38 koenker 2018 and compared it to a null model of differences between two sets of random habitat suitabilities the closer real modelled differences i e median solid blue and red line are to the difference of the null models dashed black line the higher the chances that these differences are random we also plotted the absolute difference between the models against the most important environmental variables to examine for potential relationships 3 results all models generally performed well with a 5 fold cross validated mean auc of 0 928 and 0 930 for barbel and 0 902 and 0 895 for grayling in the rn and sc model respectively the predicted distribution patterns were rather similar between the two modelling approaches for both species fig 2 overall the sc model barbel mean habitat suitability 0 078 sd 0 184 grayling mean 0 143 sd 0 246 provided slightly higher suitabilities compared to the rn models barbel mean 0 067 sd 0 166 grayling mean 0 121 sd 0 218 table s2 as indicated by wilcoxon signed rank tests barbel v 1 20 1012 p 0 001 grayling v 1 22 1012 p 0 001 the models predicted the majority of the river reaches between 71 9 and 84 1 as unsuitable for both species suitable habitats suitability 0 2 for barbel were mainly predicted in the main stems of the larger rivers ruhr and lenne fig 2a and b table s2 suitable habitats for grayling were predicted more upstream also including several smaller tributaries fig 2c and d a comparison with the null model allowed identifying areas of highest agreement between the sc and rn models fig 3 while accounting for potential by chance differences from comparing two sets of random habitat suitabilities contrary to our expectations the suitability models differed least at low predicted habitat suitabilities 0 3 fig 3 at medium habitat suitabilities 0 4 0 7 the highest disagreement between both models was observed reaching values close to the difference between two random models at high predicted habitat suitabilities 0 8 the differences were again lower especially in barbel while differences increased again towards perfectly suitable habitat in grayling the different extraction approaches for environmental variables rn and sc the latter introducing subcatchment smoothing led to differences in the environmental predictor sets that were used in the respective habitat suitability models for some variables for example distance to source the extraction approach did not entail differences between environmental predictors spearman rho 1 p 0 001 the lowest match between environmental predictors extracted with the rn and sc approach was found for the variable dead channel rho 0 43 p 0 001 table s3 a correlation analysis revealed a strong negative relationship between the number of zeros in an environmental predictor and the agreement between both methods of extraction rho 0 95 p 0 001 reflecting that the sc extraction approach led to smoothing especially in patchily distributed highly localized environmental structures the predicted habitat suitabilities alternated at fine spatial scales especially in areas of medium and high habitat suitability fig 4 differences in predicted habitat suitability between the two models rn and sc did not vary systematically with gradients of environmental predictors fig 5 regarding variable importance geographic predictors were the most important predictor group contributing in total between 74 6 and 84 4 to the models the group of hydromorphological predictors generally contributed less however their contribution was slightly higher in the rn compared to the sc models table 1 from the geographic predictors distance to source was by far the most important predictor in all models contributing to 62 1 72 8 bankfull cross section width was the most important hydromorphological predictor and the only present in all models followed by flow variation and cross section width variability other predictors contributed less to the models table 1 the number of predictors used in the final models differed while the five geographic predictors were considered important across all models a slightly higher number of hydromorphological predictors 15 vs 11 and 12 vs 9 for the barbel and grayling models respectively were selected in the rn models compared to the sc models 3 1 regularization multiplier increasing the beta parameter value in the rn models led to a smoothing of predicted habitat suitabilities across small spatial scales fig s1 moreover increased beta parameter values were associated with an increase in mean and median habitat suitabilities response curves from the sensitivity analysis of the maxent models showed changes in predicted habitat suitability across the gradient of a given predictor fig 6 an increase in the beta parameter value led to smoother responses up to a level where a predictor no longer provided any useful information to the model fig 6 green line such flat response curves lead to predictors being neglected in the model building process resulting in models with very few remaining predictors table 2 exemplary for grayling river network model at a beta value of 10 it was mainly the predictors distance to source elevation and slope that remained informative to the models for the sc models smoothing was already performed during the variable extraction therefore the sc models had generally lower predictor values compared to the rn models e g max 17 vs 5 cascades per 100 m river reach fig 6 left generally and irrespective of the choice of the beta value 1 2 3 6 or 10 in the rn models differences between the rn models and the sc models with the default beta parameter value of 1 were statistically clear although minor in size wilcoxon signed rank tests all p 0 001 for both species a beta value of 1 and 2 in the rn model minimized the median differences between the rn and the sc model and the dispersion in model differences larger beta values in the rn models were associated with larger median differences between the rn and sc model in both species fig s2 3 2 consequences of the extent of the study catchment restricting the spatial extent of the models to the natural distributional area of a given fish species caused a decline in the auc from 0 93 to 0 69 barbel and 0 90 to 0 80 grayling across both model setups compared to the full extent models mean predicted habitat suitabilities changed only slightly for the barbel models from 0 32 sd 0 27 to 0 30 sd 0 25 and 0 28 sd 0 26 to 0 21 sd 0 22 for the sc and rn approach respectively for the grayling models mean habitat suitabilities changed from 0 29 sd 0 29 to 0 26 sd 0 28 and 0 24 sd 0 26 to 0 21 sd 0 24 for the sc and rn approach respectively wilcoxon signed rank tests indicated statistically clear differences between the full extent and restricted extent models for barbel sc v 6 932 p 0 001 rn v 6 231 p 0 001 and grayling sc v 3 523 p 0 001 rn v 3 377 p 0 001 but differences appeared small fig s3 both the rn and sc model based on a restricted extent selected more predictor variables compared to their equivalent model based on the entire catchment area table 3 in the restricted extent models geographic predictors contributed about 45 less to explain species distributions compared to the models that used the entire catchment while the importance of hydromorphological predictors increased for barbel the predictors flow variation depth variability and cross section depth showed the greatest gains for grayling cross section width variability and bankfull cross section width gained most importance in the models with a restricted extent 4 discussion the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of different spatial scales of environmental predictors i e their granularity and overall spatial extent in a maxent sdm for two river fish species high auc values indicated the successful modelling of the distribution of both considered species the general patterns of modelled distributions followed our expectations of high habitat suitabilities in rivers where the respective species are considered an indicator species fish stream type classification see fig 1 generally the sdms predicted spatially very heterogeneous patterns of habitat suitabilities even within a species core distributional area the observed patchiness of habitats is considered a natural feature of highly heterogeneous river systems that are typically dynamic in space and time e g vannote et al 1980 fausch et al 2002 thorp et al 2006 thus multiple conceptual models have been developed to understand how ecological processes and populations are affected by this heterogeneity and dynamic see winemiller et al 2010 for example fausch et al 2002 proposed an integrative view on rivers specifically to aid stream fish conservation efforts remarking that scientist too often focus on small scale single river reaches thereby ignoring the overall complexity and continuous as well as hierarchical nature of rivers they argue that effective research and management of stream fishes have to consider the stream network as a dynamic landscape providing fish habitats for moving fish and for different life stages consequently sdms such as those developed in this study can help to understand the underlying mechanisms of species distribution at different scales and hence aid river restoration or fish conservation measures for example sdms with coarse resolution might reveal relevant effects of stream temperature whereas finer resolution models given sufficient data at high spatial resolution might reveal the importance of small scale habitat structures detecting the heterogeneity of habitat patches is also important with regard to fish movement ecology and the functional connectivity of rivers for example when an unsuitable reach within an otherwise suitable river possibly forms a barrier for movement and migration fuller et al 2015 radinger et al 2017a thus small but highly suitable patches might provide essential stepping stone habitats and thereby contribute to the improvement of connectivity which is a major restoration goal of riverine ecosystems 4 1 differences between the model setups overall our results revealed high conformity between the rn and sc model setups as hypothesized differences between both models were particularly high in reaches of medium habitat suitability there is high agreement in unsuitable areas but a closer look at areas of medium and high suitability revealed details of the differences between both modelling approaches within the larger subcatchments of uniform habitat suitability the river network model resulted in fine scaled alternating habitat suitability patterns especially in rivers of medium habitat suitability increases in difference between models towards high habitat suitabilities specifically for grayling could be explained by small scale hydromorphological predictors which are smoothened in the sc but not the rn modelling approach incision depth and instream islands for example were important in the grayling but not the barbel models grayling is also known to be more stationary whereas barbel is more mobile and might therefore be less connected to specific small scale habitat structures the model setups yielded only minor differences in the auc of the models hence auc did not allow for a general inference which of the setups produced better results at the catchment scale maxent s analysis of predictor contribution showed a clear dominance of broad geographic predictors especially the distance to river source largely contributed to the explaining of the distributions of barbel and grayling these variables reflect the overall location of a given site within the longitudinal continuum of a river network which in turn is correlated with habitat attributes such as water temperature flow velocity oxygen content and substrate see river continuum concept rcc vannote et al 1980 these attributes could not explicitly be included as predictors in our models due to insufficient data the two fish species modelled in this study are eponymous for two fish zones along this longitudinal gradient the barbel zone in the upper potamal and the grayling in the lower rhitral zone huet 1949 aarts and nienhuis 2003 the geographic predictors that dominate in each model mirror these general zones well and so do the results with high habitat suitabilites in the according river sections the hydromorphological predictors follow then at a subordinate level in a hierarchical filtering process to form local species assemblages poff 1997 lake et al 2007 we did not identify any specific environmental predictors as responsible for differences between the rn and sc models one potential reason might be the dominance of geographic predictors that were of similar importance in both model setups local inconsistencies seemed to be related to the patchy patterns of some environmental predictors with locally high variable values for example in the rn models dead channels only existed in 2 8 of all river reaches but with numbers of up to 20 dead channels per 100 m these high values are less well represented in the sc models as they are smoothed to lower average values for an entire subcatchment this leads for example to a higher percentage of 14 1 of subcatchments having dead channels but with a lower count of maximum 5 0 dead channels per 100 m this might explain why hydromorphological predictors are better represented in the rn setup than in the sc setup that being said in case the specific numbers of certain channel features are of particular ecological relevance for a species the rn setup might be the better choice as it avoids predictor smoothing compared to the sc model on the other hand if important predictors hold many gaps or the sheer existence of a channel feature is essential then the sc setup might lead to better results it was beyond the scope of our study to explicitly examine whether it is the number of hydromorphological features or rather their existence that is most influential on the distribution patterns of the two modelled species using the highest spatial resolution possible does not necessarily lead to higher quality results also because fish are generally mobile and might utilize several habitats along the river course populations need a certain extent of suitable habitat to maintain their resilience a specific number of fragmented instream channel features in a single river reach might be less important to maintain viable populations compared to the overall characteristic of multiple adjacent reaches along the longitudinal continuum radinger et al 2015 that is especially true if we take into account that point occurrence data of generally mobile organisms such as most fishes might capture only a snapshot in space and time it must also be taken into account that fish are sampled along river reaches of variable length which might not necessarily agree with the spatial granularity of a species distribution model for river management both model setups cover complementary important information a spatial resolution of few hundred meters river reaches is able to identify individual habitat features that can be vital for a certain species and or life stage modelling approaches building on such high resolution data can show ecological deficits or impediments for the occurrence of the modelled species discovering such local features in a species distribution model can contribute to the prioritization of restoration sites a model on a coarser scale better accounts for the minimum spatial requirements of a fish population a suitable but short reach in an otherwise unsuitable river might not be sufficient for a species to sustain a fine scale rn model could be used to identify structural problems that lead to small scale habitat degradations that affect the bigger picture that is provided by the sc model 4 2 regularization multiplier our results revealed that increasing the beta parameter relaxes the constraints imposed by the environmental predictors on the model which can in turn facilitate the comparison of models based on different spatial units overall predicted habitat suitabilities increased with increasing beta making the model more generalizable at the cost of reduced accuracy as response curves became smoother fig s1 nevertheless auc scores hence the ability of the model to predict the test data with the training data were high and did not indicate overfitted models transferring and testing the models in a different catchment would then be a next step to assess model validity however this was beyond the scope of this study as hypothesized our results showed that an increase of the beta parameter value in the rn models leads to a higher conformity with the subcatchment models increasing the beta parameter value has a similar effect like the smoothing of predictors however it might also cause local habitat features being erased from the model building process which would make a model overly general and only considering superordinate predictors e g climate and hydrology consequently for future applications of the maxent sdm software we emphasize the importance of testing a set of multiple regularization multipliers beta values and selecting the most appropriate based on model evaluation e g using cross validation however choosing the optimal regularization parameter value is not trivial laborious tuning experiments morales et al 2017 radosavljevic et al 2014 merow et al 2013 are considered the only way to find the optimum a suite of tools that can support this process is enmtools warren et al 2010 4 3 restricting the extent of the study area omitting generally unsuitable parts of the river network by restricting the modelling background domain i e the area from which pseudo absences can be selected to a species core area of distribution e g fish zone led to a notably decrease in the auc score of the model this is not surprising since unsuitable areas are excluded that were otherwise predicted correctly as unsuitable by the models that means extending a study area by including unsuitable habitat outside its general distributional area or choosing an unreasonably large study area is likely to increase the auc making the model seemingly better than it is the dependence of the auc on the choice of the geographic extent of a study has been described before e g lobo et al 2008 hence comparing model accuracy between different species that naturally have different areas of occurrence it is prone to bias this also prevented us from directly comparing the auc of our full extent models with those of restricted extent restricting the extent of the study area also changed the environmental predictors contributions to the model as hypothesized local hydromorphological predictors gained importance in the restricted extent models compared to the models covering the full study area the geographic predictors especially distance to source decreased in their dominance because the longitudinal location within the river network was already restricted to areas of relative suitability following the hierarchical filtering concept poff 1997 hydromorphological predictors should then gain importance which was also indicated by our results 4 4 implications for conservation and management overall sdms can provide valuable information about the potential distribution of species thereby helping to prioritize conservation areas sánchez cordero et al 2005 designing protected areas for target species esselman and allan 2011 moilanen et al 2008 and or improving our understanding of global change induced distributional shifts e g radinger et al 2017b bond et al 2011 for river restoration projects sdms can provide valuable information about structural elements that are particularly important for a given species and thereby help to optimize and prioritize restoration measures and sites we argue that for these purposes models that incorporate hydromorphological predictors and those that are trained at ecologically relevant study extents are particularly useful as such models can inform about the small scale heterogeneity of habitats both model setups either based on actual river reaches or subcatchments provide important information that is complementary for management and conservation a spatial resolution of river reaches of few hundred meters is able to identify individual habitat features that can be vital for a certain species and or life stage hence modelling approaches building on such high resolution data allow showing ecological deficits or impediments for the occurrence of the modelled species discovering such local features in a species distribution model can contribute to the prioritization of restoration sites models on a coarser scale however might better account for the minimum spatial requirements of a fish population and allow

evaluated in bio and geo applications parameter and predictive uncertainty of soil respiration models by considering the difference between observations and model predictions i e residual error which is assumed neither to be independent nor to be described by a normal i e gaussian probability distribution with a mean of zero and constant variance in this paper we use 2 year observations of soil carbon flux from 2017 to 2018 hereafter referred to as long term simulation obtained with two open top chambers to estimate parameter and predictive uncertainty of a simple soil respiration model based on bayesian statistics in a cool temperate forest in western japan we also use a gaussian innovative residual error model in which a generalised likelihood uncertainty estimation that accounts for correlated heteroscedastic non normally distributed i e non gaussian residual error flexibly handles statistics varying in skewness and kurtosis results show that the effects of correlation and heteroscedasticity were eliminated adequately additionally the posterior distribution of the residuals had a pattern intermediate to those of gaussian and laplacian or double exponential distributions consequently the predicted soil respiration rate and range of uncertainty therein well matched the observational data furthermore we compare results of parameter and predictive inference of the soil respiration model from the long term simulation with those constrained of short term simulations i e 4 month subsets of the 2 year dataset to determine the extent to which the approach used affects the estimation of parameter and predictive uncertainty no significant difference in parameter estimates was found between the long term simulation versus any of the short term simulations whereas short term simulation analysis of the uncertainty at 50 i e between the lower 25 and upper 75 quartiles of the probability range indicated distinctive variations in model parameters in summer when more vigorous activity of trees and organisms promotes carbon cycling between the atmosphere and ecosystem overall we demonstrate that the bayesian inversion approach is useful as a means by which to evaluate effectively parameter and predictive uncertainty of a soil respiration model with precise representation of residual errors keywords data model fusion uncertainty generalised likelihood dream algorithm soil carbon flux bayesian statistics 1 introduction soil respiration is defined as the production of carbon dioxide co2 by plant roots and organisms along with chemical oxidation of carbon compounds in terrestrial soil lloyd and taylor 1994 luo and zhou 2006 a considerable amount of carbon is sequestrated in soil approximately 1550 gtc twice that of the atmosphere 760 gtc lal 2004 soil respiration accounts for 55 85 of the whole ecosystem respiration davidson et al 2006 knohl et al 2008 brændholt et al 2018 hence soil respiration is the dominant regulator of the terrestrial carbon cycle regarding climate change a serious unresolved concern is the extent of soil respiratory co2 release from terrestrial soils under future warming luo et al 2016 such biotic feedbacks would drive further warming due to the continuous release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere reichstein et al 2013 treharne et al 2018 in global carbon modelling studies evaluating total annual soil respiration is crucial luo and zhou 2006 richardson et al 2006 previous studies have represented soil respiration using a variety of model most of which are based on the positive correlation between soil respiration and either air or soil temperature schlesinger 1997 reich and schlesinger 1992 lloyd and taylor 1994 monson and baldocchi 2014 recently developed models have considered additional biotic and environmental or abiotic factors such as variation in soil moisture acosta et al 2018 gulledge and schimel 2000 richardson et al 2006 gross primary productivity gpp an indicator of total vegetation activity migliavacca et al 2015 and the decomposition properties of soluble soil carbon davidson et al 2012 richardson et al 2006 compared direct observations and estimations of soil respiration using simple representative soil respiration models that have been proposed ever model fit i e goodness of fit was assessed using a maximum likelihood fitting approach statistical synthesis that constrains the parameters of process based models in combination with observational data hereafter referred to as data model fusion have been widely used to explore the biotic and abiotic parameters regulating the terrestrial carbon cycle at different sites richardson 2012 hartig et al 2012 keenan et al 2012 luo et al 2016 typically model parameters remain constant over relatively long time scales i e annual to decadal richardson et al 2008 keenan et al 2013 in reality however with observational data difference in the temperature dependency of respiration over long term and short term i e weeks to seasonal periods occurs reichstein et al 2005 therefore it is important to investigate the extent to which model parameters are affected by a difference in temporal scales handled when using data model fusion in addition the difference between observations and model predictions i e residual errors should be carefully assessed when using data model fusion because residual error which is associated with observations model inputs and model structure makes it difficult to precisely estimate model parameters and soil respiration in many bio and geo applications residual error is assumed to be independent and identically distributed i i d with a normal or gaussian probability distribution a mean of zero and a constant variance ricciuto et al 2008 minet et al 2015 which is unrealistic when studying atmosphere surface co2 exchange in terrestrial ecosystems richardson et al 2006 savage et al 2008 furthermore richardson and hollinger 2005 indicated that flux observations are subject to temporal autocorrelation which causes non constant variance i e heteroscedasticity of residuals while residual errors are often assumed to follow a double exponential like distribution pattern that is leptokurtic compared to gaussian distributions such properties must be accounted for in models evaluating soil respiration schoups and vrugt 2010 developed a residual error model in which a generalized likelihood gl uncertainty estimation was used to account for the correlation non stationarity and non normality i e non gaussian of residual error and evaluated hydrologic model parameter and predictive inference of a conceptual rainfall runoff model in combination with a bayesian inversion framework a bayesian framework is attractive because it estimates the posterior probability density function pdf of the parameters i e parameter uncertainty variations in soil respiratory co2 and the associated uncertainty therein i e predictive uncertainty can then be inferred this technique has been thus widely used in the biogeochemical and atmosphere surface energy exchange studies hashimoto et al 2011 van oijen et al 2011 kim et al 2014 minet et al 2015 lu et al 2017 berryman et al 2018 while few studies have employed the gl approach with residuals varying in skewness and kurtosis schoups and vrugt 2010 elshall et al 2019 in the present study we use 2 years worth of soil respiratory co2 flux observations collected from two open top chambers in a cool temperate forest in western japan during the period 2017 2018 hereafter referred to as the long term simulation to constrain parameter and predictive uncertainty of a soil respiration model based on bayesian statistics furthermore we compare parameter and predictive inference model results between the long term and short term simulations when only 4 month data of the long term dataset are used to explore whether the difference in temporal scales of the approach used affects the estimation of parameter and predictive uncertainty in the analysis we use a state of art non gaussian residual error model with the gl uncertainty estimation of schoups and vrugt 2010 our goal is to assess whether the bayesian inversion approach would enable plausible evaluation of the soil respiration model parameter and predictive inference in combination with the residual error model 2 site information this study has been conducted in an undisturbed natural old growth forest near the summit of mt takanosu in higashi hiroshima western japan 34 33 n 132 44 e 922 m a s l in a cool temperate climate since 2016 according to data obtained by the automated meteorological data acquisition system amedas japan meteorological agency in a field 34 25 n 132 42 e 224 m a s l close to the mountainous area the annual average temperature and precipitation over the past three decades were 13 7 c and 1550 mm respectively https www jma go jp jma indexe html the forest was approximately 4 ha covering the northeastern slope of the mountainous area with 20 degree slope in average the dominant species were beech fagus crenata fir abies firma and hornbeam carpinus tschonoskii the dominant overstory trees in the stand were estimated to be aged over 200 years and their mean height and diameter exceeded 25 m and 1 m respectively 3 methods 3 1 model description the present analysis begins from the following framework representing the relationship between measurements and model estimates 1 y e ε where y is a vector of n data streams of soil co2 flux measurements e is a vector of the corresponding number of simulated output data from the soil respiration model for details see in 3 2 and ε is a vector of residual errors integrating the errors in flux measurements meteorological driving inputs and the model due to insufficient structural descriptions 3 2 soil respiration model in the analysis we modelled the soil respiration as a function of soil temperature t soil based on lloyd and taylor 1994 2 r soil r ref e x p e 0 1 t ref t 0 1 t soil t 0 where r soil g c m 2 d 1 is the soil respiration rate r ref g c m 2 d 1 is the reference respiration rate and e 0 k is the activation energy representing the sensitivity of ecosystem respiration to temperature the reference temperature tref and base temperature t0 were fixed at 288 15 k 15 c and 227 13 k 46 02 c respectively migliavacca et al 2015 we also used the following asymptotic model to account for the effects of soil moisture gulledge and schimel 2000 acosta et al 2018 3 r soil r r ef e x p e 0 1 t ref t 0 1 t soil t 0 s w c c s w c where swc is soil water content in by volume and c is the moisture response constant additionally migliavacca et al 2015 proposed several types of empirical ecosystem respiration reco models that consider the dependency of r ref on gpp using the functional form of a lloyd and taylor type reco model and r ref was given as follows 4 r ref r 0 h g p p where r0 is the theoretical ecosystem respiration at tref in the absence of other limiting factors and h is the influence of supply on r ref according to gpp migliavacca et al 2015 in this study r ref in eqs 2 and 3 was replaced with the r soil model from eq 4 as follows 5 r soil r 0 h g p p e x p e 0 1 t ref t 0 1 t soil t 0 6 r soil r 0 h g p p e x p e 0 1 t ref t 0 1 t soil t 0 s w c c s w c eqns 2 3 5 and 6 are referred to as model1 model2 model3 and model4 respectively 3 3 statistical residual error model in general residual errors ε are assumed to be i i d and thus can be characterised by a gaussian probability distribution with a mean of zero and constant variance schoups and vrugt 2010 however errors associated with soil respiratory co2 observations do not satisfy these assumptions savage et al 2008 and they can be represented as leptokurtic distributions i e nonnormal in addition these residual errors exhibit temporal correlations and non constant variance or heteroscedasticity schoups and vrugt 2010 proposed an alternative approach that could account for those features of ε using the following model 7 φ p b ε t σ t a t s e p 0 1 ξ β where ε t is a residual error at time t and σ t is the standard deviation at time t a t is an i i d random error with zero mean and unit standard deviation as described by a skew exponential power sep distribution ξ and β are parameters of skewness and kurtosis respectively φp b is an autoregressive polynomial with p autoregressive parameters ϕ i and the backshift operator b b i ε t ε t 1 and is determined as follows 8 φ p b 1 i 1 p ϕ i b i in this study we use a first order autoregressive model when p 1 to represent temporal autocorrelations between contiguous flux observations of soil co2 to present the non constant variance of residual errors we use the following formula 9 σ t σ 0 σ 1 r soil where σ 0 and σ 1 are model parameters eq 9 represents a linear increase in variance due mainly to the large deviation in daytime residual errors furthermore a t is described in the probability density form of sep as follows 10 p a t ξ β 2 σ ξ ξ ξ 1 ω β e x p c β a ξ t 2 1 β where a ξ t ξ s i g n μ ξ σ ξ a t μ ξ σ ξ a t in the process of deriving a t four variables μ ξ σ ξ ω β c β are used more details are provided in schoups and vrugt 2010 3 4 parameter inference based on bayesian rule and likelihood we constrain the set of carbon balance model parameters θ e and residual error model parameters θ ε using flux measurements of soil co2 based on bayesian statistics that treat all parameters as random variables gelman et al 2013 whereby θ represents θ θ e θ ε given a vector of observations y and the prior distribution p θ the posterior probability distribution p θ y including the uncertainty in θ is calculated using the bayes theorem 11 p θ y l θ y p θ where p θ represents the prior uncertainty in model parameters before y is available in general p θ is non informative in a bayesian context raj et al 2018 used both informative and non informative prior distributions with normally distributed parameters in their model simulations and obtained similar results with both approaches therefore in this study p θ was assumed to be uniform for each parameter l θ y is the conditional probability of y given θ referred to as likelihood function the log likelihood function l θ y is given by 12 l θ y n log 2 σ ξ ω β ξ ξ 1 i 1 n log σ t c β i 1 n a ξ t 2 1 β 3 5 mcmc sampling and model selection criteria we use markov chain monte carlo mcmc simulation to generate candidate samples from the posterior probability distribution p θ y of each parameter in the soil respiration model during processing we use an algorithm with a more efficient sampling framework based on the assumed proposal distribution differential evolution adaptive metropolis dream zs vrugt et al 2009 which runs multiple interacting chains simultaneously to explore the entire parameter space globally lu et al 2017 and automatically tunes the scale and orientation of the proposal distribution dream avoids entrapment in local minima and is ideally suited to non linear optimization problems in this study we set the number of mcmc steps to 1 000 000 and discarded the first 900 000 iterations as burn in in addition the number of chains was set to the number of model parameters plus one for each simulation convergence of mcmc sampling to the posterior distribution was examined using the scale reduction factor r ˆ of gelman and rubin 1992 hereafter referred to as gelman rubin factor we used r ˆ 1 1 for each parameter with lower values indicating a stationary parameter distribution for simulations using soil co2 flux observations as a constraint for estimation of model parameters we select the best model among the simulations with adequate r ˆ convergence over the whole simulation then we use the bayesian predictive information criterion bpic ando 2007 which is a statistical measure for evaluating the fit of predictive distributions developed using the averaging approach of the bayesian model based on maximizing the posterior mean of the expected log likelihood ando 2007 4 database 4 1 soil respiration rate r soil continuous meteorological observations have been performed at the experimental site since june 2016 to obtain input data for soil respiration models t soil and swc were measured using a thermistor temperature probe 109 campbell scientific usa and water content reflectometer cs650 campbell scientific usa which were both deployed 5 cm below the ground precipitation pr was measured using a portable rain gauge 7852m davis usa which was placed on the top of an unmanned lodge at the summit of the mountain co2 concentrations emitted from the underlying soil were observed at two points close to the meteorological operating system using a soil ground transmitter gmt20 vaisala finland deployed inside two automated open top chambers manufactured by technical staff at the institute of low temperature science hokkaido university soil respiratory co2 flux f s co 2 g co2 m 2 s 1 was calculated based on co2 concentration measurements as follows 13 f s c o 2 ρ v a δ c δ t 273 273 t s 1000 where ρ is co2 density 1 96 kg m 3 v and a are the volume and cross sectional area respectively of the chamber and δc is the incremental rate of co2 concentration m3 m 3 in a specific time duration δt in this study we set δt to 10 min 600 s meteorological observations were performed at 10 min intervals using a portable data logger cr200 campbell scientific usa measurements of co2 concentration were made three times per day every 4 h during the daytime 8 00 a m 12 00 p m and 16 00 p m and 3 of data for every measurement was recorded every 5 min in 10 min using an additional cr200 data logger 4 2 normalised canopy photosynthesis p g we measured seasonal changes of leaf photosynthesis in the dominant beech trees in the stand using a portable gas exchange system li 6400 li cor lincoln ne usa observations were conducted five times during the period may october 2018 may 16 jun 13 aug 7 sep 18 and oct 4 for every observation three branches with twigs and leaves were cut off from the canopy with one edge cut obliquely to promote water uptake by the branch which was soaked in water in a bucket for 1 h prior to the measurement at our laboratory before the actual measurements the sample leaf was exposed to several intense lights i e 1000 μmol m 2 s 1 for 30 min 1300 μmol m 2 s 1 for 10 min and 1500 μmol m 2 s 1 for 10 min using an internal led light source li 640b li cor to let the leaves adjust to different light intensities the following criteria for inclusion in the analysis were applied based on toda et al 2018 1 the sampled sunlit leaves were well developed 2 the in leaf chlorophyll contents which were measured using a chlorophyll meter spad 502plus konica minolta optics inc osaka japan were over 30 spad and 3 similar hydro thermal conditions in the leaf chamber were maintained i e leaf temperature of 25 c water vapor pressure deficit vpd 1 2 kpa and saturating co2 concentration of 400 μmol mol 1 in addition we considered whether the stomatal conductance of each leaf was stable a total of 15 sample leaves were used the photosynthesis measurements were conducted under a photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd ranging from 0 to 2000 μmol m 2 s 1 using three leaves for each measurement the values of the light saturated rate of gross canopy photosynthesis pmax g c m 2 d 1 and the quantum flux at which half saturation of the light response curve occurs km mol m 2 d 1 were estimated from the relationship between leaf photosynthesis and ppfd using non linear regression method and averaged the pmax and km values were 13 0 0 7 and 233 7 13 6 in may 11 8 1 1 and 185 7 15 2 in june 8 2 0 7 and 148 7 8 in august 6 3 0 9 and 145 7 34 8 in september and 8 1 1 1 and 185 3 37 in october respectively n b we used the parameter values obtained in june for early to mid july and those obtained in august for the mid to late july the pmax and km values estimated for each month in 2018 during the leaf photosynthesis measurements were assumed to be available for the corresponding months in 2017 using the pmax and km values annual variations in the modelled canopy photosynthesis pg were calculated as a function of incident photosynthetically active radiation par and leaf area index lai as follows 14 p g p max p a r 0 p a r 0 k m l a i max l a i where par0 was measured using a quantum sensor sq212 apogee instruments inc utah usa mounted on the top of the lodge at the summit of the mountain where the open space is favourable for radiative measurement par measurements were sampled every 10 s and recorded as 10 min average using a data logger cr1000 campbell scientific usa lai was evaluated from a suite of quantum sensors two par sensors were placed 1 m above the understory near the open top chambers in the stand to capture the representative transmitted radiation component part using the radiation components of par0 and part the fraction of par radiation transmitted through the canopy fpar was calculated as follows richardson et al 2013 toda and richardson 2018 15 f p a r p a r t p a r 0 where part is the mean of the two quantum sensor measurements using eq 15 plant area index pai that represents the aggregated area of leaf and woody plant materials such as stems twigs and fine branches can be given as 16 p a i l n f p a r k where k is the light extinction coefficient lai was evaluated using the pai measurements alone derived from the optical devices by subtracting the averaged pai during leafless period representing woody material from the actually measured pai throughout a year we estimated the averaged pai 2 13 m2 m 2 more details for calculating lai from the optical par measurements are described in toda and richardson 2018 finally the modelled pg time series was estimated by normalizing day to day lai using the maximum value of lai in a year for 2017 and 2018 respectively 4 3 simulation setup the meteorological variables t soil swc pr and lai as well as the modelled pg were processed on the daily basis as input data for the model run fig 1 regarding the soil co2 observations one of the two chambers had not worked since the end of may 2018 because the solar panel failed to supply the electric transmittance necessary to open the chamber lid during processing some daily data when daily precipitation was greater than 30 mm d 1 were eliminated in addition data in december 2018 were not obtained due to sensor malfunction therefore data for 293 days in 2017 and 290 days in 2018 were available for the bayesian simulations using these model inputs we first evaluate model parameter and predictive uncertainty of r soil using all available data for 2017 and 2018 hereafter referred to as a bayesian calibration for the long term simulation then we compare the results from the long term simulation to those obtained using 12 short term simulations hereafter referred to as s1 s12 in which 4 month blocks of data from the long term simulation dataset are used as an example the s1 s2 and s12 simulations use observational data from january to april from february to may and december to march respectively in both 2017 and 2018 data from the same month in both years are combined table 1 shows prior uncertainty range of soil respiration model and residual error model parameters constrained using observational data in the simulations in the present study the statistical estimations were conducted using the r freeware program r version 3 3 3 for statistical computing and graphics r core team 2017 5 results 5 1 model parameter and predictive uncertainty of soil respiration rate r soil the goodness of fit between the observations and predictions of r soil was compared among the four models the bayesian predictive information criterion bpic which are a measure for evaluating the accuracy of models were 594 1 for model1 594 5 for model2 551 6 for model3 and 551 7 for model4 respectively therefore model3 with the minimum bpic value was determined as the most accurate model fig 2 shows sample time series and posterior histograms for five parameters from the residual error model and four from the soil respiration model after applying the burn in procedure all parameters were adequately sampled between the lower and upper thresholds for each parameter fig 2 and the gelman rubin factor r ˆ of all parameters for model3 was close to r ˆ 1 table 2 as a result the posterior distribution of the parameter pdfs was well identified the absolute values of the correlations among the parameters were less than 0 8 table 3 meaning the individual parameters were to some extent determined independently the median value of σ 1 was around 0 132 the positive value of σ 1 indicates an increase in the variance of the residual error with the magnitude of r soil i e the dataset was heteroscedastic the median values of β and ξ were 0 455 and 0 812 respectively indicating that the histogram of the inferred a t was somewhat leptokurtic and less skewed fig 3 a the histogram of a t agreed well with the theoretically assumed distribution of a t fig 3a for negative or positive a t larger than a t 2 the histogram showed a gaussian distribution with β 0 and ξ 1 and was also consistent with a laplacian or double exponential distribution having long tails β 1 and ξ 1 for a t 2 furthermore the model successfully eliminated the temporal correlation between residuals r2 0 087 p 0 035 falling within the 95 confidence interval despite daily time lags fig 3b fig 4 shows annual variations in r soil predicted using the constrained model parameters the predicted value of r soil and its 95 confidence interval consistently matched the observed r soil the root mean square error rmse g c m 2 d 1 between the observed and predicted r soil when using the median values was 0 57 fig 4a a t was randomly distributed around a t 0 for all predicted r soil values indicating that the residual error parameters used to predict r soil were not affected by heteroscedasticity fig 4b 5 2 comparison of soil respiratory parameters inferred using long and short term simulations soil respiratory model parameters for the short term simulations showed high seasonal variations fig 5 r ref increased as the seasons progressed and peaked in s6 fig 5a significant differences were not detected among the annual estimates however the uncertainty at 50 i e between the lower 25 and upper 75 quartiles of the probability range of s6 ranged between 2 22 and 2 48 g c m 2 d 1 and the 95 confidential interval was significantly different between both s1 s5 and s8 s12 table 4 meanwhile the uncertainty at 50 of r ref for the long term dataset was 1 82 1 88 g c m 2 d 1 which was similar to the average of those of the short term simulations 1 83 1 98 g c m 2 d 1 by contrast e 0 decreased as the seasons progressed in the short term s2 s6 simulations fig 5b the minimum uncertainty at 50 of e 0 also occurred in s6 e0 335 5 373 5 k table 4 afterward e 0 increased and stabilised in s10 s11 e 0 448 5 480 k in s1 and s12 short term simulations e 0 indicated the different seasonality and its higher uncertainty compared to the s2 s11 simulations the e 0 values for the long term simulation was estimated to be 446 2 461 4 k the average e 0 during the s2 s11 simulations was 429 9 k table 4 the difference between e 0 for the long versus short term simulations δe 0 was 24 0 k when using median values which is quite reasonable compared to values estimated in warm temperate forests in europe reichstein et al 2005 moreover h was distributed around h 0 with low uncertainty for s2 s9 and higher uncertainty for s1 and s11 s12 the uncertainty of h at 50 for each of short term simulations was almost the same as that for the long term simulation 0 137 to 0 091 for the s2 s9 simulations and 0 115 to 0 097 for the long term simulation fig 5c meanwhile the rmse between the observed and predicted r soil was consistently lower for the short term simulations than for the long term simulation the averages were 0 47 and 0 51 for short and long term simulations respectively table 5 6 discussion and remarks in the present bayesian inversion analysis the model accounting for the effect of gpp on annual variations in r soil model3 was selected as the best among the four lloyd and taylor type models we found that for 2 year long term observations of r soil the selected model constrained all parameters adequately various types of errors associated with measurements model inputs and model structure were noted in the parameter inference the effects of which we did not treat individually rather we integrated the errors using a gl uncertainty estimation that accounted for autocorrelation heteroscedasticity and non normality of residual error for precise estimation of the posterior parameter distribution figs 2 4 the residual error showed a distribution pattern that was intermediate between gaussian and laplacian distributions fig 3a and the predicted r soil and its 95 confidence interval well matched the observational data due to the accurate parameter estimations fig 4 previous studies have indicated that residual errors follow a heteroskedastic laplacian distribution when using multi datasets of soil respiration savage et al 2008 or eddy covariance flux of co2 for several forest sites e g hollinger and richardson 2005 richardson and hollinger 2005 richardson et al 2006 2008 elshall et al 2019 a laplacian distribution is characterised by its heavier tails and more leptokurtic than a gaussian distribution indicating that large errors occur more often than they would under the gaussian distribution while small errors are much more common richardson and hollinger 2005 in contrast the use of gaussian error model showed a better performance in calibration compared to using a non gaussian error model when using eddy covariance flux of co2 for several grassland and forest sites e g minet et al 2015 lu et al 2017 these results suggest that the application of non gaussian residual error model in which a generalised likelihood gl function handles flexibly statistical properties of residuals i e varying skewness and kurtosis may be an essential modelling methodology to evaluate uncertainty of surface atmosphere co2 exchange over various terrestrial ecosystems because the error model has a large effect on the results of the parameter inference hartig et al 2012 we also compared parameter and predictive uncertainty between the long and short term simulations some short term simulations of s1 s11 and s12 showed different seasonal variations in soil respiratory parameters with its higher uncertainty compared to the other simulations s12 for r ref s1 and s12 for e0 and s1 and s11 s12 for h respectively this may have probably attributed to the small number of data which lowered accuracy of parameter and predictive inference used for each of the simulations due to malfunction of the observational system table 4 meanwhile the uncertainty at 50 of r ref and e 0 for s6 june to september was significantly larger and smaller respectively versus the other short term simulations which were composed of 4 month blocks of data from january to april and october to december fig 5 this indicates distinctive seasonal variations in model parameters where in summer increased organismal production promotes carbon cycling between the atmosphere and ecosystem among all simulations the seasonal variability in h which represents the dependency of soil respiration on gpp was lower than that of r ref and e 0 fig 5 however the results suggest that accurate estimation of model parameter and predictive inference is possible based on r ref e 0 and h combined we used a michelis menten model derived gpp time series as model input data which were obtained in the absence of any environmental stresses in combination with direct measurements of leaf photosynthesis on specific days of the month from may to october 2018 it is likely that gpp may have evaluated under stressful conditions which could reduce carbon uptake by plants due to water deficit and thermal damage in a given environment suggesting that errors in the model inputs may have influenced the assessment of the best fit model therefore some uncertainty remains in the present results use of gpp data derived from continuous measurements such as in situ tower based measurements of co2 flux would allow for more definitive conclusions to be drawn when using the data model fusion framework overall we demonstrate that the bayesian inversion approach is useful as a means by which to evaluate effectively parameter and predictive uncertainty of soil respiration model with precise representation of residual errors

24914,careful modelling of soil carbon sequestration is essential to evaluate future terrestrial feedback to the earth climate system through atmosphere surface carbon exchange few studies have evaluated in bio and geo applications parameter and predictive uncertainty of soil respiration models by considering the difference between observations and model predictions i e residual error which

carbon flux from 2017 to 2018 hereafter referred to as long term simulation obtained with two open top chambers to estimate parameter and predictive uncertainty of a simple soil respiration model based on bayesian statistics in a cool temperate forest in western japan we also use a gaussian innovative residual error model in which a generalised likelihood uncertainty estimation that accounts for correlated heteroscedastic non normally distributed i e non gaussian residual error flexibly handles statistics varying in skewness and kurtosis results show that the effects of correlation and heteroscedasticity were eliminated adequately additionally the posterior distribution of the residuals had a pattern intermediate to those of gaussian and laplacian or double exponential distributions

compounds in terrestrial soil lloyd and taylor 1994 luo and zhou 2006 a considerable amount of carbon is sequestrated in soil approximately 1550 gtc twice that of the atmosphere 760 gtc lal 2004 soil respiration accounts for 55 85 of the whole ecosystem respiration davidson et al 2006 knohl et al 2008 brændholt et al 2018 hence soil respiration is the dominant regulator of the terrestrial carbon cycle regarding climate change a serious unresolved concern is the extent of soil respiratory co2 release from terrestrial soils under future warming luo et al 2016 such biotic feedbacks would drive further warming due to the continuous release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere reichstein et al 2013 treharne et al 2018 in global carbon modelling studies evaluating total annual soil respiration is crucial luo and zhou 2006 richardson et al 2006 previous studies have represented soil respiration using a variety of model most of which are based on the positive correlation between soil respiration and either air or soil temperature schlesinger 1997 reich and schlesinger 1992 lloyd and taylor 1994 monson and baldocchi 2014 recently developed models have considered additional biotic and environmental or abiotic factors such as variation in soil moisture acosta et al 2018 gulledge and schimel 2000 richardson et al 2006 gross primary productivity gpp an indicator of total vegetation activity migliavacca et al 2015 and the decomposition properties of soluble soil carbon davidson et al 2012 richardson et al 2006 compared direct observations and estimations of soil respiration using simple representative soil respiration models that have been proposed ever model fit i e goodness of fit was assessed using a maximum likelihood fitting approach statistical synthesis that constrains the parameters of process based models in combination with observational data hereafter referred to as data model fusion have been widely used to explore the biotic and abiotic parameters regulating the terrestrial carbon cycle at different sites richardson 2012 hartig et al 2012 keenan et al 2012 luo et al 2016 typically model parameters remain constant over relatively long time scales i e annual to decadal richardson et al 2008 keenan et al 2013 in reality however with observational data difference in the temperature dependency of respiration over long term and short term i e weeks to seasonal periods occurs reichstein et al 2005 therefore it is important to investigate the extent to which model parameters are affected by a difference in temporal scales handled when using data model fusion in addition the difference between observations and model predictions i e residual errors should be carefully assessed when using data model fusion because residual error which is associated with observations model inputs and model structure makes it difficult to precisely estimate model parameters and soil respiration in many bio and geo applications residual error is assumed to be independent and identically distributed i i d with a normal or gaussian probability distribution a mean of zero and a constant variance ricciuto et al 2008 minet et al 2015 which is unrealistic when studying atmosphere surface co2 exchange in terrestrial ecosystems richardson et al 2006 savage et al 2008 furthermore richardson and hollinger 2005 indicated that flux observations are subject to temporal autocorrelation which causes non constant variance i e heteroscedasticity of residuals while residual errors are often assumed to follow a double exponential like distribution pattern that is leptokurtic compared to gaussian distributions such properties must be accounted for in models evaluating soil respiration schoups and vrugt 2010 developed a residual error model in which a generalized likelihood gl uncertainty estimation was used to account for the correlation non stationarity and non normality i e non gaussian of residual error and evaluated hydrologic model parameter and predictive inference of a conceptual rainfall runoff model in combination with a bayesian inversion framework a bayesian framework is attractive because it estimates the posterior probability density function pdf of the parameters i e parameter uncertainty variations in soil respiratory co2 and the associated uncertainty therein i e predictive uncertainty can then be inferred this technique has been thus widely used in the biogeochemical and atmosphere surface energy exchange studies hashimoto et al 2011 van oijen et al 2011 kim et al 2014 minet et al 2015 lu et al 2017 berryman et al 2018 while few studies have employed the gl approach with residuals varying in skewness and kurtosis schoups and vrugt 2010 elshall et al 2019 in the present study we use 2 years worth of soil respiratory co2 flux observations collected from two open top chambers in a cool temperate forest in western japan during the period 2017 2018 hereafter referred to as the long term simulation to constrain parameter and predictive uncertainty of a soil respiration model based on bayesian statistics furthermore we compare parameter and predictive inference model results between the long term and short term simulations when only 4 month data of the long term dataset are used to explore whether the difference in temporal scales of the approach used affects the estimation of parameter and predictive uncertainty in the analysis we use a state of art non gaussian residual error model with the gl uncertainty estimation of schoups and vrugt 2010 our goal is to assess whether the bayesian inversion approach would enable plausible evaluation of the soil respiration model parameter and predictive inference in combination with the residual error model 2 site information this study has been conducted in an undisturbed natural old growth forest near the summit of mt takanosu in higashi hiroshima western japan 34 33 n 132 44 e 922 m a s l in a cool temperate climate since 2016 according to data obtained by the automated meteorological data acquisition system amedas japan meteorological agency in a field 34 25 n 132 42 e 224 m a s l close to the mountainous area the annual average temperature and precipitation over the past three decades were 13 7 c and 1550 mm respectively https www jma go jp jma indexe html the forest was approximately 4 ha covering the northeastern slope of the mountainous area with 20 degree slope in average the dominant species were beech fagus crenata fir abies firma and hornbeam carpinus tschonoskii the dominant overstory trees in the stand were estimated to be aged over 200 years and their mean height and diameter exceeded 25 m and 1 m respectively 3 methods 3 1 model description the present analysis begins from the following framework representing the relationship between measurements and model estimates 1 y e ε where y is a vector of n data streams of soil co2 flux measurements e is a vector of the corresponding number of simulated output data from the soil respiration model for details see in 3 2 and ε is a vector of residual errors integrating the errors in flux measurements meteorological driving inputs and the model due to insufficient structural descriptions 3 2 soil respiration model in the analysis we modelled the soil respiration as a function of soil temperature t soil based on lloyd and taylor 1994 2 r soil r ref e x p e 0 1 t ref t 0 1 t soil t 0 where r soil g c m 2 d 1 is the soil respiration rate r ref g c m 2 d 1 is the reference respiration rate and e 0 k is the activation energy representing the sensitivity of ecosystem respiration to temperature the reference temperature tref and base temperature t0 were fixed at 288 15 k 15 c and 227 13 k 46 02 c respectively migliavacca et al 2015 we also used the following asymptotic model to account for the effects of soil moisture gulledge and schimel 2000 acosta et al 2018 3 r soil r r ef e x p e 0 1 t ref t 0 1 t soil t 0 s w c c s w c where swc is soil water content in by volume and c is the moisture response constant additionally migliavacca et al 2015 proposed several types of empirical ecosystem respiration reco models that consider the dependency of r ref on gpp using the functional form of a lloyd and taylor type reco model and r ref was given as follows 4 r ref r 0 h g p p where r0 is the theoretical ecosystem respiration at tref in the absence of other limiting factors and h is the influence of supply on r ref according to gpp migliavacca et al 2015 in this study r ref in eqs 2 and 3 was replaced with the r soil model from eq 4 as follows 5 r soil r 0 h g p p e x p e 0 1 t ref t 0 1 t soil t 0 6 r soil r 0 h g p p e x p e 0 1 t ref t 0 1 t soil t 0 s w c c s w c eqns 2 3 5 and 6 are referred to as model1 model2 model3 and model4 respectively 3 3 statistical residual error model in general residual errors ε are assumed to be i i d and thus can be characterised by a gaussian probability distribution with a mean of zero and constant variance schoups and vrugt 2010 however errors associated with soil respiratory co2 observations do not satisfy these assumptions savage et al 2008 and they can be represented as leptokurtic distributions i e nonnormal in addition these residual errors exhibit temporal correlations and non constant variance or heteroscedasticity schoups and vrugt 2010 proposed an alternative approach that could account for those features of ε using the following model 7 φ p b ε t σ t a t s e p 0 1 ξ β where ε t is a residual error at time t and σ t is the standard deviation at time t a t is an i i d random error with zero mean and unit standard deviation as described by a skew exponential power sep distribution ξ and β are parameters of skewness and kurtosis respectively φp b is an autoregressive polynomial with p autoregressive parameters ϕ i and the backshift operator b b i ε t ε t 1 and is determined as follows 8 φ p b 1 i 1 p ϕ i b i in this study we use a first order autoregressive model when p 1 to represent temporal autocorrelations between contiguous flux observations of soil co2 to present the non constant variance of residual errors we use the following formula 9 σ t σ 0 σ 1 r soil where σ 0 and σ 1 are model parameters eq 9 represents a linear increase in variance due mainly to the large deviation in daytime residual errors furthermore a t is described in the probability density form of sep as follows 10 p a t ξ β 2 σ ξ ξ ξ 1 ω β e x p c β a ξ t 2 1 β where a ξ t ξ s i g n μ ξ σ ξ a t μ ξ σ ξ a t in the process of deriving a t four variables μ ξ σ ξ ω β c β are used more details are provided in schoups and vrugt 2010 3 4 parameter inference based on bayesian rule and likelihood we constrain the set of carbon balance model parameters θ e and residual error model parameters θ ε using flux measurements of soil co2 based on bayesian statistics that treat all parameters as random variables gelman et al 2013 whereby θ represents θ θ e θ ε given a vector of observations y and the prior distribution p θ the posterior probability distribution p θ y including the uncertainty in θ is calculated using the bayes theorem 11 p θ y l θ y p θ where p θ represents the prior uncertainty in model parameters before y is available in general p θ is non informative in a bayesian context raj et al 2018 used both informative and non informative prior distributions with normally distributed parameters in their model simulations and obtained similar results with both approaches therefore in this study p θ was assumed to be uniform for each parameter l θ y is the conditional probability of y given θ referred to as likelihood function the log likelihood function l θ y is given by 12 l θ y n log 2 σ ξ ω β ξ ξ 1 i 1 n log σ t c β i 1 n a ξ t 2 1 β 3 5 mcmc sampling and model selection criteria we use markov chain monte carlo mcmc simulation to generate candidate samples from the posterior probability distribution p θ y of each parameter in the soil respiration model during processing we use an algorithm with a more efficient sampling framework based on the assumed proposal distribution differential evolution adaptive metropolis dream zs vrugt et al 2009 which runs multiple interacting chains simultaneously to explore the entire parameter space globally lu et al 2017 and automatically tunes the scale and orientation of the proposal distribution dream avoids entrapment in local minima and is ideally suited to non linear optimization problems in this study we set the number of mcmc steps to 1 000 000 and discarded the first 900 000 iterations as burn in in addition the number of chains was set to the number of model parameters plus one for each simulation convergence of mcmc sampling to the posterior distribution was examined using the scale reduction factor r ˆ of gelman and rubin 1992 hereafter referred to as gelman rubin factor we used r ˆ 1 1 for each parameter with lower values indicating a stationary parameter distribution for simulations using soil co2 flux observations as a constraint for estimation of model parameters we select the best model among the simulations with adequate r ˆ convergence over the whole simulation then we use the bayesian predictive information criterion bpic ando 2007 which is a statistical measure for evaluating the fit of predictive distributions developed using the averaging approach of the bayesian model based on maximizing the posterior mean of the expected log likelihood ando 2007 4 database 4 1 soil respiration rate r soil continuous meteorological observations have been performed at the experimental site since june 2016 to obtain input data for soil respiration models t soil and swc were measured using a thermistor temperature probe 109 campbell scientific usa and water content reflectometer cs650 campbell scientific usa which were both deployed 5 cm below the ground precipitation pr was measured using a portable rain gauge 7852m davis usa which was placed on the top of an unmanned lodge at the summit of the mountain co2 concentrations emitted from the underlying soil were observed at two points close to the meteorological operating system using a soil ground transmitter gmt20 vaisala finland deployed inside two automated open top chambers manufactured by technical staff at the institute of low temperature science hokkaido university soil respiratory co2 flux f s co 2 g co2 m 2 s 1 was calculated based on co2 concentration measurements as follows 13 f s c o 2 ρ v a δ c δ t 273 273 t s 1000 where ρ is co2 density 1 96 kg m 3 v and a are the volume and cross sectional area respectively of the chamber and δc is the incremental rate of co2 concentration m3 m 3 in a specific time duration δt in this study we set δt to 10 min 600 s meteorological observations were performed at 10 min intervals using a portable data logger cr200 campbell scientific usa measurements of co2 concentration were made three times per day every 4 h during the daytime 8 00 a m 12 00 p m and 16 00 p m and 3 of data for every measurement was recorded every 5 min in 10 min using an additional cr200 data logger 4 2 normalised canopy photosynthesis p g we measured seasonal changes of leaf photosynthesis in the dominant beech trees in the stand using a portable gas exchange system li 6400 li cor lincoln ne usa observations were conducted five times during the period may october 2018 may 16 jun 13 aug 7 sep 18 and oct 4 for every observation three branches with twigs and leaves were cut off from the canopy with one edge cut obliquely to promote water uptake by the branch which was soaked in water in a bucket for 1 h prior to the measurement at our laboratory before the actual measurements the sample leaf was exposed to several intense lights i e 1000 μmol m 2 s 1 for 30 min 1300 μmol m 2 s 1 for 10 min and 1500 μmol m 2 s 1 for 10 min using an internal led light source li 640b li cor to let the leaves adjust to different light intensities the following criteria for inclusion in the analysis were applied based on toda et al 2018 1 the sampled sunlit leaves were well developed 2 the in leaf chlorophyll contents which were measured using a chlorophyll meter spad 502plus konica minolta optics inc osaka japan were over 30 spad and 3 similar hydro thermal conditions in the leaf chamber were maintained i e leaf temperature of 25 c water vapor pressure deficit vpd 1 2 kpa and saturating co2 concentration of 400 μmol mol 1 in addition we considered whether the stomatal conductance of each leaf was stable a total of 15 sample leaves were used the photosynthesis measurements were conducted under a photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd ranging from 0 to 2000 μmol m 2 s 1 using three leaves for each measurement the values of the light saturated rate of gross canopy photosynthesis pmax g c m 2 d 1 and the quantum flux at which half saturation of the light response curve occurs km mol m 2 d 1 were estimated from the relationship between leaf photosynthesis and ppfd using non linear regression method and averaged the pmax and km values were 13 0 0 7 and 233 7 13 6 in may 11 8 1 1 and 185 7 15 2 in june 8 2 0 7 and 148 7 8 in august 6 3 0 9 and 145 7 34 8 in september and 8 1 1 1 and 185 3 37 in october respectively n b we used the parameter values obtained in june for early to mid july and those obtained in august for the mid to late july the pmax and km values estimated for each month in 2018 during the leaf photosynthesis measurements were assumed to be available for the corresponding months in 2017 using the pmax and km values annual variations in the modelled canopy photosynthesis pg were calculated as a function of incident photosynthetically active radiation par and leaf area index lai as follows 14 p g p max p a r 0 p a r 0 k m l a i max l a i where par0 was measured using a quantum sensor sq212 apogee instruments inc utah usa mounted on the top of the lodge at the summit of the mountain where the open space is favourable for radiative measurement par measurements were sampled every 10 s and recorded as 10 min average using a data logger cr1000 campbell scientific usa lai was evaluated from a suite of quantum sensors two par sensors were placed 1 m above the understory near the open top chambers in the stand to capture the representative transmitted radiation component part using the radiation components of par0 and part the fraction of par radiation transmitted through the canopy fpar was calculated as follows richardson et al 2013 toda and richardson 2018 15 f p a r p a r t p a r 0 where part is the mean of the two quantum sensor measurements using eq 15 plant area index pai that represents the aggregated area of leaf and woody plant materials such as stems twigs and fine branches can be given as 16 p a i l n f p a r k where k is the light extinction coefficient lai was evaluated using the pai measurements alone derived from the optical devices by subtracting the averaged pai during leafless period representing woody material from the actually measured pai throughout a year we estimated the averaged pai 2 13 m2 m 2 more details for calculating lai from the optical par measurements are described in toda and richardson 2018 finally the modelled pg time series was estimated by normalizing day to day lai using the maximum value of lai in a year for 2017 and 2018 respectively 4 3 simulation setup the meteorological variables t soil swc pr and lai as well as the modelled pg were processed on the daily basis as input data for the model run fig 1 regarding the soil co2 observations one of the two chambers had not worked since the end of may 2018 because the solar panel failed to supply the electric transmittance necessary to open the chamber lid during processing some daily data when daily precipitation was greater than 30 mm d 1 were eliminated in addition data in december 2018 were not obtained due to sensor malfunction therefore data for 293 days in 2017 and 290 days in 2018 were available for the bayesian simulations using these model inputs we first evaluate model parameter and predictive uncertainty of r soil using all available data for 2017 and 2018 hereafter referred to as a bayesian calibration for the long term simulation then we compare the results from the long term simulation to those obtained using 12 short term simulations hereafter referred to as s1 s12 in which 4 month blocks of data from the long term simulation dataset are used as an example the s1 s2 and s12 simulations use observational data from january to april from february to may and december to march respectively in both 2017 and 2018 data from the same month in both years are combined table 1 shows prior uncertainty range of soil respiration model and residual error model parameters constrained using observational data in the simulations in the present study the statistical estimations were conducted using the r freeware program r version 3 3 3 for statistical computing and graphics r core team 2017 5 results 5 1 model parameter and predictive uncertainty of soil respiration rate r soil the goodness of fit between the observations and predictions of r soil was compared among the four models the bayesian predictive information criterion bpic which are a measure for evaluating the accuracy of models were 594 1 for model1 594 5 for model2 551 6 for model3 and 551 7 for model4 respectively therefore model3 with the minimum bpic value was determined as the most accurate model fig 2 shows sample time series and posterior histograms for five parameters from the residual error model and four from the soil respiration model after applying the burn in procedure all parameters were adequately sampled between the lower and upper thresholds for each parameter fig 2 and the gelman rubin factor r ˆ of all parameters for model3 was close to r ˆ 1 table 2 as a result the posterior distribution of the parameter pdfs was well identified the absolute values of the correlations among the parameters were less than 0 8 table 3 meaning the individual parameters were to some extent determined independently the median value of σ 1 was around 0 132 the positive value of σ 1 indicates an increase in the variance of the residual error with the magnitude of r soil i e the dataset was heteroscedastic the median values of β and ξ were 0 455 and 0 812 respectively indicating that the histogram of the inferred a t was somewhat leptokurtic and less skewed fig 3 a the histogram of a t agreed well with the theoretically assumed distribution of a t fig 3a for negative or positive a t larger than a t 2 the histogram showed a gaussian distribution with β 0 and ξ 1 and was also consistent with a laplacian or double exponential distribution having long tails β 1 and ξ 1 for a t 2 furthermore the model successfully eliminated the temporal correlation between residuals r2 0 087 p 0 035 falling within the 95 confidence interval despite daily time lags fig 3b fig 4 shows annual variations in r soil predicted using the constrained model parameters the predicted value of r soil and its 95 confidence interval consistently matched the observed r soil the root mean square error rmse g c m 2 d 1 between the observed and predicted r soil when using the median values was 0 57 fig 4a a t was randomly distributed around a t 0 for all predicted r soil values indicating that the residual error parameters used to predict r soil were not affected by heteroscedasticity fig 4b 5 2 comparison of soil respiratory parameters inferred using long and short term simulations soil respiratory model parameters for the short term simulations showed high seasonal variations fig 5 r ref increased as the seasons progressed and peaked in s6 fig 5a significant differences were not detected among the annual estimates however the uncertainty at 50 i e between the lower 25 and upper 75 quartiles of the probability range of s6 ranged between 2 22 and 2 48 g c m 2 d 1 and the 95 confidential interval was significantly different between both s1 s5 and s8 s12 table 4 meanwhile the uncertainty at 50 of r ref for the long term dataset was 1 82 1 88 g c m 2 d 1 which was similar to the average of those of the short term simulations 1 83 1 98 g c m 2 d 1 by contrast e 0 decreased as the seasons progressed in the short term s2 s6 simulations fig 5b the minimum uncertainty at 50 of e 0 also occurred in s6 e0 335 5 373 5 k table 4 afterward e 0 increased and stabilised in s10 s11 e 0 448 5 480 k in s1 and s12 short term simulations e 0 indicated the different seasonality and its higher uncertainty compared to the s2 s11 simulations the e 0 values for the long term simulation was estimated to be 446 2 461 4 k the average e 0 during the s2 s11 simulations was 429 9 k table 4 the difference between e 0 for the long versus short term simulations δe 0 was 24 0 k when using median values which is quite reasonable compared to values estimated in warm temperate forests in europe reichstein et al 2005 moreover h was distributed around h 0 with low uncertainty for s2 s9 and higher uncertainty for s1 and s11 s12 the uncertainty of h at 50 for each of short term simulations was almost the same as that for the long term simulation 0 137 to 0 091 for the s2 s9 simulations and 0 115 to 0 097 for the long term simulation fig 5c meanwhile the rmse between the observed and predicted r soil was consistently lower for the short term simulations than for the long term simulation the averages were 0 47 and 0 51 for short and long term simulations respectively table 5 6 discussion and remarks in the present bayesian inversion analysis the model accounting for the effect of gpp on annual variations in r soil model3 was selected as the best among the four lloyd and taylor type models we found that for 2 year long term observations of r soil the selected model constrained all parameters adequately various types of errors associated with measurements model inputs and model structure were noted in the parameter inference the effects of which we did not treat individually rather we integrated the errors using a gl uncertainty estimation that accounted for autocorrelation heteroscedasticity and non normality of residual error for precise estimation of the posterior parameter distribution figs 2 4 the residual error showed a distribution pattern that was intermediate between gaussian and laplacian distributions fig 3a and the predicted r soil and its 95 confidence interval well matched the observational data due to the accurate parameter estimations fig 4 previous studies have indicated that residual errors follow a heteroskedastic laplacian distribution when using multi datasets of soil respiration savage et al 2008 or eddy covariance flux of co2 for several forest sites e g hollinger and richardson 2005 richardson and hollinger 2005 richardson et al 2006 2008 elshall et al 2019 a laplacian distribution is characterised by its heavier tails and more leptokurtic than a gaussian distribution indicating that large errors occur more often than they would under the gaussian distribution while small errors are much more common richardson and hollinger 2005 in contrast the use of gaussian error model showed a better performance in calibration compared to using a non gaussian error model when using eddy covariance flux of co2 for several grassland and forest sites e g minet et al 2015 lu et al 2017 these results suggest that the application of non gaussian residual error model in which a generalised likelihood gl function handles flexibly statistical properties of residuals i e varying skewness and kurtosis may be an essential modelling methodology to evaluate uncertainty of surface atmosphere co2 exchange over various terrestrial ecosystems because the error model has a large effect on the results of the parameter inference hartig et al 2012 we also compared parameter and predictive uncertainty between the long and short term simulations some short term simulations of s1 s11 and s12 showed different seasonal variations in soil respiratory parameters with its higher uncertainty compared to the other simulations s12 for r ref s1 and s12 for e0 and s1 and s11 s12 for h respectively this may have probably attributed to the small number of data which lowered accuracy of parameter and predictive inference used for each of the simulations due to malfunction of the observational system table 4 meanwhile the uncertainty at 50 of r ref and e 0 for s6 june to september was significantly larger and smaller respectively versus the other short term simulations which were composed of 4 month blocks of data from january to april and october to december fig 5 this indicates distinctive seasonal variations in model parameters where in summer increased organismal production promotes carbon cycling between the atmosphere and ecosystem among all simulations the seasonal variability in h which represents the dependency of soil respiration on gpp was lower than that of r ref and e 0 fig 5 however the results suggest that accurate estimation of model parameter and predictive inference is possible based on r ref e 0 and h combined we used a michelis menten model derived gpp time series as model input data which were obtained in the absence of any environmental stresses in combination with direct measurements of leaf photosynthesis on specific days of the month from may to october 2018 it is likely that gpp may have evaluated under stressful conditions which could reduce carbon uptake by plants due to water deficit and thermal damage in a given environment suggesting that errors in the model inputs may have influenced the assessment of the best fit model therefore some uncertainty remains in the present results use of gpp data derived from continuous measurements such as in situ tower based measurements of co2 flux would allow for more definitive conclusions to be drawn when using the data model fusion framework overall we demonstrate that the bayesian inversion approach is useful as a means by which to evaluate effectively parameter and predictive uncertainty of soil respiration model with precise representation of residual errors
