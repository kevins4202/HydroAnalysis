introduction problems involving scattering of water waves in a fluid by an obstacle are widely investigated by many researchers over the years due to its possible applications the scientists often used a technique namely linearized water wave theory where the amplitude of waves are assumed to be very small compared to other length scales in the problem recently interest has been extended to bodies which are immersed in two layer fluids having a different density one reason for this is the suggestion by friis et al 1991 that an underwater pipe bridge might be built across one of the norwegian fjords which typically consists of a layer of fresh water of finite depth on top of a very deep body of salt water the propagation of water waves in a two layer fluid in absence of any obstacle was described by stokes 1847 long back till now many researchers worked on study of water wave propagation in multilayered fluids with an interface see kassem 1982 1986 chakrabarti and mandal 1983 mandal and chakrabarti 1986 rhodes robinson 1994 kassem 1982 1986 considered the problems dealing with the generation of internal waves at the surface separating two fluids involves the consideration of different types of singularities in one of the two finite depth fluids neglecting surface tension at the interface chakrabarti and mandal 1983 mandal and chakrabarti 1986 rhodes robinson 1994 studied the effects of singularities in either of the layers in an infinite depth fluid by methods similar to those which are used for the corresponding one fluid problems in these investigations interests have been centered on the determination of the potentials for two dimensional wave sources or multipoles and axisymmetric multipoles linton and mciver 1995 developed the general theory for two dimensional motion in a two layer fluid in which the lower layer of heavier density extends infinitely downwards and the upper layer of lower density has a free surface they studied the problem of wave scattering by a horizontal circular cylinder in either the upper or lower layer by using a method based on multipole expansions das and mandal 2006 extended the problem of linton and mciver 1995 where the upper layer is considered to be bounded by a thin ice sheet in last few decades there is a considerable development in the field of offshore constructions a submerged structure such as breakwaters plays significant role in reducing the wave lodes acting on various marine facilities a significant reason for the construction of submerged breakwaters is that free exchange of water mass through the structures is usually necessary so that the water in the sheltered region can be kept circulating and therefore prevented from pollution scattering of surface waves by a thin vertical barrier submerged in a single layer fluid is considered by dean 1948 ursell 1950 evans 1970 and others for deep water wherein the barrier is either fully submerged and extends infinitely downwards or partially immersed or submerged in an infinitely deep water mciver 1985 exercised the scattering of waves by a pair of surface piercing vertical barriers using a method based on eigenfunction expansions and described a theory to determine the resonant frequencies at which the reflection and transmission coefficient vanish porter and evans 1995 employed method of solving water wave scattering by barriers in a finite depth water based on a galerkin approximation a theoretical study for water wave interaction with a floating body of arbitrary shape in a two layered fluid of finite depth was established by ten and kashiwagi ten and kahiwagi 2004 they proposed an efficient numerical method of evaluating the velocity potentials by boundary integral equation method the scattering of surface water waves by a semi infinite floating membrane due to abrupt change in bottom topography is analyzed using expansion formulae by karmakar and sahoo 2008 barriers considered in the literature described above are impermeable but in case of a permeable structure it has the ability of energy dissipation so that transmission of energy through the barrier are reduced which is of great interest in many ocean engineering applications studies related to water wave scattering by porous barriers have been carried out by a list of researchers a porous wavemaker theory to study the generation of water waves by the harmonic oscillation of a thin porous plate extended from the free surface to the channel bottom in water of finite depth have been introduced by chwang 1983 water wave diffraction by porous breakwaters have been studied by yu 1995 chwang chwang and chan 1998 gave a general review on the interaction between porous media and wave motion their studies focused on the effect of a porous structure on incoming wave trains and the movement of waves past a plate with regular gaps in it using the method of eigenfunction expansion in conjunction with least square approximations lee and chwang 2000 studied water wave scattering and radiation problems they have considered different configurations of the porous barrier sahoo et al sahoo et al 2000 extended the work of lee and chwang 2000 by studding oblique wave scattering by a porous barrier and analyzed the variations of reflection coefficients hydrodynamic pressure differences along the two sides of the barriers and surface elevations for different parameters manam and sahoo 2005 analyzed the scattering of oblique water wave by a fully extended porous barrier in a two layer fluid having a free surface and an interface they used a modified orthogonal relation to solve the problem using eigenfunction expansion method and derived the explicit forms of the reflection and transmission coefficients the scattering of surface wave by a thin permeable flexible barrier in a two layered finite depth fluid with free surface where the barrier is considered to be fixed at two ends have been studied by kumar et al kumar et al 2007 and behera et al behera et al 2013 a hydrodynamic model of perforated or slotted structures have been proposed by molin 2011 and different cases of application are presented two and three dimensional cylinders wave absorbers consisting in perforated plates plates and disks and water entry of perforated wedges behera et al behera et al 2015 investigated the phenomenon of the oblique wave scattering by a rectangular porous structure in two layer finite depth fluid the associated mathematical problem is solved by eigenfunction expansion method a variety of methods such as finite element method eigenfunction expansion method and boundary integral equation method have been used extensively to study water wave scattering by barriers these methods are so efficient that results of many experimental works are compared with theoretical works with success cho and kim 2008 studied the oblique wave interaction with porous plates of different configurations using matched eigenfunction expansion method and boundary element method they have correlated the theoretical results through experiments with horizontal inclined dual porous plates in these methods the inevitable singularities at the end points of the barrier have not been considered martin 1991 developed a method for determining the behavior of the solutions to a hypersingular integral equation near the end points of the interval of integration parsons and martin 1992 1994 have studied the problem of water wave scattering by a vertical plate and a curved plate submerged in a single fluid using hypersingular integral equation over the plate for difference potential this approach has several advantages for instance the radiation condition is automatically satisfied by the choice of green s function similarly the behavior of difference potential at each edge of the plate where there are square root zeros can be easily enforced moreover the method is applicable to curved plates as well as flat plates in fact apart from some simple quadratures the only approximation required is that of a bounded function defined on a finite interval this can be done by choosing an appropriate set of orthogonal polynomials namely chebyshev polynomials of the second kind and then using a collocation method on the governing integral equation using hypersingular integral equation approach the problem of wave scattering by a porous plate in a singe layered fluid was studied by gayen and mondal 2014 mandal et al 1995 considered two superposed fluids of infinite depth and a thin vertical barrier of infinite length submerged completely in the lower layer dhillon et al 2014 considered the problem of wave scattering by a vertical partially immersed barrier in a fluid consisting of a layer of finite depth bounded above by a free surface and below by an infinite layer of fluid of density greater than the upper layer sarkar et al 2014 developed a mathematical model to investigate the hydrodynamic behavior of a wave energy farm consisting of a large number of oscillating wave surge converters in arbitrary configuration with oblique wave incidence the application of green s integral theorem yields hypersingular integral equations which are then solved by using the chebyshev polynomials of the second kind in the present paper we consider the scattering of water waves by a permeable thin vertical submerged plate in the upper layer of two superposed fluids the upper layer being of finite depth and having a free surface while the lower layer extending finitely as well as infinitely downwards in such a two layer fluid wave can propagate with two wave modes when the density ratio of the fluid is very small one can interpret these different modes very easily for an arbitrary but stable density ratio there is a possibility that some of the energy may transferred from one mode to another due to an obstacle in the wave field by suitable application of green s integral theorem in two fluid regions the problem is formulated as a hypersingular integral equation for difference of potentials across the barrier a collocation method involving chebyshev polynomials of second kind is applied to solve the hypersingular integral equation this reduces the equation to a system of linear equations which can be solved by standard methods the solutions are used to get the reflection and transmission coefficients for incident waves of both the modes the energy conservation relations due to the presence of porous barrier are obtained in two dimensional context the numerical values for the proportion of energy reflected transmitted and dissipated for incident waves two different modes are computed and depicted graphically to demonstrate the effect of depth ratio and porosity of the thin plate the energy conservation relations in a single layer fluid are calculated and analyzed numerically to check the correctness of the numerical results presented here 2 formulation of the problem we consider irrotational motion in a two layered inviscid incompressible and homogeneous fluid of which the upper layer is of density ρ 1 and the lower layer is of density ρ 2 ρ 1 here a two dimensional co ordinate system is chosen in such a way that the y axis is taken vertically downwards with the plane y 0 as the undisturbed free surface and y h denotes the mean interface the upper layer is occupying the region 0 y h x and the lower layer occupying the region y h x for infinite depth water idw and h y h x for finite depth water fdw a thin vertical porous barrier described by x 0 a y b is completely submerge in the upper fluid see fig 1 assuming linear theory the time harmonic motions in the fluid are described by the velocity potentials ℜ ϕ x y e i ω

for incident wave of internal mode by interchange m to m in the expressions given in eqns 106 109 4 energy identities in the theoretical study of scattering of water waves energy identities or energy balance equations plays a very important role these equations relate the reflection as well as transmission coefficients associated with the scattering problem and validate the analytic as well as numerical results for a two layered fluid under consideration there exists two energy balance relations satisfied by the reflection and transmission coefficients corresponding to the incident waves from negative infinity are given by linton and mciver 1995 moreover in presence of porous barrier some incident energy may dissipated and so the energy conversion equations are given by 110 e i r e i t e i r e i t e i d 1 for i 1 2 where e 1 r r 1 2 e 1 r j r 1 2 and e 1 t t 1 2 e 1 t j t 1 2 are the reflected and transmitted energy respectively due to incidence wave of unit energy with surface wavenumber similarly e 2 r r 2 2 j e 2 r r 2 2 and e 2 t t 2 2 j e 2 t t 2 2 are the reflected and transmitted energy respectively due to incidence wave of unit energy with internal wavenumber corresponding to the incidence wave of surface and internal wave modes the dissipated energies are denoted by e 1 d and e 2 d respectively different expressions are given as follows case1 infinite

is to see how the energy in the incident waves is distributed among the transmitted reflected and dissipated energies this results provides an major criteria in deciding the effectiveness of the porous barrier the transmitted reflected and dissipated energies due to incident wave of unit energy are analyzed for different parameters as a function of k b it is clear that t 1 r 1 and t 2 r 2 and consequently e 1 t e 1 r and e 2 t e 2 r 5 1 1 to fix a suitable truncation size n rapid convergence of the results using present method depends on the truncated size n in table 1 the reflection coefficients in two layer infinite depth fluid are calculated for a b 0 1 h b 2 g 0 25 i s 0 25 in two layer finite depth fluid the reflection coefficients are calculated and shown in table 2 for a b 0 1 h b 1 1 h b 8 5 g 0 25 i s 0 25 it is observed from the table that a four figure accuracy can be achieved by considering n 10 in case of infinite depth fluid while five figure accuracy are obtained in two layered finite depth fluid for n 10 so we consider n 10 to calculate the theoretical curves of the hydrodynamic quantities a direct comparison have been done in table 3 by calculating numerical values of reflection and transmission coefficients in a single layered fluid using present method with those given by evans 1970 for a b 0 05 h b 2 g 0 s 1 the results obtained here are coincide upto four decimal places for a surface piercing rigid barrier in a finite depth fluid the reflection and transmission coefficients are calculated by using hypersingular integral equation approach at three different submergence depth namely b h 0 1 0 5 0 9 mathematically we have considered s 1 g 0 a h 0 001 h h 0 95 and m b 0 5 the obtained values are given in table 4 and compared with the results observed by porter and evans 1995 it can be seen that the reflection and transmission coefficients have the same value as that of porter and evans 1995 for four figure accuracy li et al li et al 2015 studied the water wave scattering by a vertical thin porous barrier in a finite depth fluid using multi term galerkin method the numerical values of the reflection and transmission coefficients are calculated and compared with those values obtained by eigenfunction expansion method for a surface piercing barrier table 5 of li et al 2015 in our study we have considered g 1 0 25 i m b 0 6 a h 0 001 h h 0 95 s 1 to calculate the reflection and transmission coefficients at three different submergence depth namely b h 0 1 0 5 0 9 it can be seen that a 3 4 figure accuracy can be achieved using n 10 while the matched eigenfunction expansion solutions need almost 600 truncated terms to achieve three figure accuracy at best 5 1 2 for two layer infinite depth fluid the effect of density ratio of the fluids on transmission coefficient of wavenumber k and κ are shown in fig 2 in fig 3 the proportion of incident energy of wavenumber k that is transmitted and reflected with wavenumbers k and κ are shown for a b 0 1 h b 2 g 0 25 i for different density ratios s 0 2 0 3 0 4 the proportion of energy dissipated are also drawn the reflected energy of wavenumber k increases with increasing s while the transmitted energies of modes k and κ are decreasing functions of k b for a particular porosity parameter energy dissipation decreases with increasing s it is observed that the change in fluid density ratio has negligible effect on the reflection and transmission of incident waves the results for the scattering of a normally incident wave by a permeable plate submerged beneath the free surface at a depth a b 0 1 0 3 0 5 are shown in figs 4 5 in fig 4 the transmission coefficients t 1 and t 1 are plotted for three different submergence depth of the plate the graphs showing that pick of t 1 increases while t 1 decreases with increasing value of a b the curves of e 1 r e 1 t e 1 r and e 1 d are drawn against dimensionless wavenumber k b it is observed that e 1 r and e 1 d increases at first with increasing k b until a maximum reached and then decreases as k b increases similarly e 1 t decreases at first and then increases with k b if we compare the values of e 1 t and e 1 t it can observed that the value of transmitted energy corresponding to the free surface mode is larger than the value of transmitted energy corresponding to the interface mode this is plausible because large values of wave number corresponds to short wave which are confined near the free surface are mostly transmitted over the barrier with same wave number figs 6 7 show curves of t 1 t 1 e 1 r e 1 t e 1 r and e 1 d plotted against k b corresponding to different value of the porosity parameters of the thin permeable plate in fig 6 the transmission coefficients versus k b are plotted for different values of porosity parameter it is observed that with an increase in k b initially the transmission coefficient of surface mode decreases and then increases uniformly for larger values of k b the transmission coefficient of internal mode decreases as the value of g increases for incident wave of wavenumber k reflected energy with wave mode k decreases as the porosity of the barrier increase for a particular value of k b this result can be comprehended with the physical intuition that when g increases which will allow more fluid and energy to pass through the barrier and thus the reflection coefficients decrease the graphs of e 1 t shows that the transmitted energy decreases with increasing g when the value of k b is either very small or very large and for some intermediate value of k b the curves increases with increasing k b this behavior is quite natural in presence of porous barrier see lee and chwang 2000 the transmitted energy of mode κ i e e 1 r decreases with increase in porosity parameter g the dissipated energy e 1 d for incidence wave energy with wavenumber k increases with increase in g in fig 8 reflected energies of wavenumber κ transmitted energies of wavenumbers κ and k corresponding to an incident wave of wavenumber κ are shown against k b for various values of density ratio of the fluids it is observed that as density ratio increases the reflected energy of wavenumber κ i e e 2 r and the transmitted energy of wavenumber k i e e 2 t will decrease for a fixed value of k b however the transmitted energy of wavenumber κ i e e 2 t will increase with increasing density ratio as the density ratio increases the amplitude of dissipated energy i e e 2 d due to incident wave of wavenumber κ are increasing up to a certain value of k b and then decrease rapidly the proportion of incident energy of wavenumber κ reflected transmitted and dissipated by the porous plate are shown in fig 9 at different submergence depth of top end it is observed that the amplitudes of e 2 r e 2 t and e 2 d curves decreases with increasing depth for fixed value of dimensionless wavenumber k b however the amplitudes of e 2 t curves increases with increasing depth in this figure it can be seen that as the barrier approaches the surface it becomes more effective than a totally submerged barrier fig 10 depicted here are the reflected energies of wavenumber κ transmitted energies of wavenumber κ and k and dissipated energies due to incident wave of wavenumber κ versus k b for different values of the porosity parameter g the graphs showing the fact that as the porosity of the plate increase energy reflection and transmission of wavenumber κ and k decreases energy dissipation by the plate increase with increasing g 5 1 3 for two layer finite depth fluid the effects of submergence depth of the plate below the free surface and porosity of the plate in a two layer finite depth fluid are shown in figs 11 and 12 the graphs behave almost same as in case of infinite depth fluid for numerical calculations 10 non propagating modes were taken into account in fig 11 the reflected and dissipated energies are plotted as a function of non dimensional wavenumber k b for different values of a b 0 1 0 3 0 5 for h b 8 5 h b 2 g 0 25 0 25 i and s 0 25 it is observed that the maximum value of energy reflection as well as dissipation decreases with increase in submergence depth so the results in this case are similar for wave scattering by a submerged vertical porous plate in an infinite depth fluid as in fig 3 in fig 12 the reflected and dissipated energies are plotted for different values of porous effect parameter g 0 25 0 5 0 75 it is observed that the reflected energy decreases with an increase in the absolute value of the porous effect parameter g energy dissipation due to increase in the absolute value of g is increasing upto a certain value of k b and then decreasing function of k b as anticipated the results in this case show similar trends to infinite depth fluid due to configuration similarity 5 2 dynamic forces 5 2 1 for two layer infinite depth fluid the magnitude of the horizontal wave force acting on the vertical porous plate is denoted as c f is obtained using the formula see behera and sahoo 2014 121 c f i ρ ω a b f y d y ρ ω k 0 g a b ϕ x x 0 d y where f y ϕ 0 y ϕ 0 y and the value of ρ is appropriately chosen depending on the physical nature of the problem the non dimensional form of the horizontal force coefficient on the vertical porous plate is given by 122 k f c f ρ 2 g h 2 fig 13 a shows the variation in horizontal force coefficient k f versus k b for different values of the porosity parameter g for incident wave of mode k it is observed that the force acting on the thin porous barrier diminishes with increase in the absolute value of the porosity parameter g which is due to the dissipation of wave energy by the porous barrier as observed in fig 7 5 2 2 for two layer finite depth fluid in this case the non dimensional form of the horizontal force coefficient on the vertical porous plate is given by 123 k f c f ρ 2 g h h the horizontal force coefficient due to the wave force acting on the vertical porous plate in two layer finite depth fluid are depicted against k b for various values of the porosity parameter g and shown in fig 13 b the general pattern of the curves is similar to that of the infinite depth fluid as in fig 13 a both the fig 13 a b the horizontal force increases with increase in k b and attains maximum for certain moderate value of k b further it is seen that for higher values of k b i e in the short wave regime the wave force coefficient k f decreases as k b increases 5 3 approximation for single layer fluid it is possible to derive the results in a single layer fluid by making s 1 in eqn 9 the reflection and transmission coefficients due to the presence of a thin vertical porous barrier in a single layer infinite depth fluid are obtained from 29 and we find that 124 t 1 1 k a b e k y f y d y 125 r 1 k a b e k y f y d y similarly the reflection and transmission coefficients in a single layer fluid of depth h are obtained as 126 t 1 1 2 m cosh m h 2 m h sinh 2 m h a b f y cosh m h y d y 127 r 1 2 m cosh m h 2 m h sinh 2 m h a b f y cosh m h y d y where m satisfies the dispersion equation u sinh u h k cosh u h 0 these are well known results obtained by gayen and mondal 2014 in fig 14 a we plot the data for r 1 as computed by the method of evans 1970 and the present method for the submergence ratio a b 0 05 with s 1 g 0 the data are represented by a solid line and respectively the figure reveal the excellent agreement of evans s results with those obtained by the current work thus we have been successful to provide a straightforward and efficient method to study the effects of a fixed vertical porous barrier on progressive waves in a two layered fluid fig 14 b showing the proportion of incident energy reflected by an impermeable plate in a single layer fluid numerically we let s 1 g 0 amount of energy reflected by the barrier tells the importance of the submergence depth as the value of a b increases the maximum hight of the reflected energy decreases for all wavelength this the obvious since most of the wave transmitted through the gap between the free surface and top of the plate these results ensure the correctness of the present method in fig 15 the reflection coefficient r 1 corresponding to normally incident wave in a singe layered finite depth fluid are plotted at three different values of h b 8 5 2 83 1 7 the graph shows that the agreement between our results with those in gayen and mondal 2014 is highly satisfactory in presence of such type of porous plate the dissipated energies are plotted as a function of k b and the observations are also comprehend with theoretical results 6 conclusion the problem of water wave scattering by a permeable thin vertical plate submerged in upper layer of two superposed fluids is studied the upper fluid is of uniform finite depth bounded by a free surface and a plane interface the depth of the lower fluid is either infinite or finite for such a problem wave can propagate with two wave modes namely surface mode and interface mode along the free surface and the interface respectively green s integral theorem is applied to formulate the problem in terms of hypersingular integral equation for the unknown difference potential across the barrier these difference potentials are approximated by a finite series of chebyshev polynomials for incident wave of both the modes reflection and transmission coefficients are calculated in term of integrals involving difference potentials the proportion of energy reflected and transmitted for an incidence wave are calculated due to the presence of permeable plate the total energy reflected and transmitted is always less than unity the amount of energy dissipated by the plate are also calculated corresponding to the incidence wave of both the wavenumbers the numerical results show that the energy conservation corresponding to different modes depend highly on the position and porosity of the barrier also it is observed that for incidence wave of a particular wavenumber most of the energy transmitted with the same wavenumber the change in density ratio of the fluids have negligible effect on the scattering wave field in presence of the permeable plate the effectiveness of the plate is maximum when it touches the free surface for a fixed value of k b amplitude of the energy reflection of surface mode is lager than that of the energy reflection of internal mode for incidence wave of both the wavenumbers the solutions obtained here telling the fact that in a two layered infinite depth fluid a surface piercing barrier is more effective than a completely submerged plate in terms of energy reflection also a permeable thin plate can be use as a breakwater in a two layered fluid acknowledgments the authors thank the reviewers for their comments and suggestions to revise the paper in the present form this work is partially supported by a

introduction problems involving scattering of water waves in a fluid by an obstacle are widely investigated by many researchers over the years due to its possible applications the scientists often used a technique namely linearized water wave theory where the amplitude of waves are assumed to be very small compared to other length scales in the problem recently interest has been extended to bodies which are immersed in two layer fluids having a different density one reason for this is the suggestion by friis et al 1991 that an underwater pipe bridge might be built across one of the norwegian fjords which typically consists of a layer of fresh water of finite depth on top of a very deep body of salt water the propagation of water waves in a two layer fluid in absence of any obstacle was described by stokes 1847 long back till now many researchers worked on study of water wave propagation in multilayered fluids with an interface see kassem 1982 1986 chakrabarti and mandal 1983 mandal and chakrabarti 1986 rhodes robinson 1994 kassem 1982 1986 considered the problems dealing with the generation of internal waves at the surface separating two fluids involves the consideration of different types of singularities in one of the two finite depth fluids neglecting surface tension at the interface chakrabarti and mandal 1983 mandal and chakrabarti 1986 rhodes robinson 1994 studied the effects of singularities in either of the layers in an infinite depth fluid by methods similar to those which are used for the corresponding one fluid problems in these investigations interests have been centered on the determination of the potentials for two dimensional wave sources or multipoles and axisymmetric multipoles linton and mciver 1995 developed the general theory for two dimensional motion in a two layer fluid in which the lower layer of heavier density extends infinitely downwards and the upper layer of lower density has a free surface they studied the problem of wave scattering by a horizontal circular cylinder in either the upper or lower layer by using a method based on multipole expansions das and mandal 2006 extended the problem of linton and mciver 1995 where the upper layer is considered to be bounded by a thin ice sheet in last few decades there is a considerable development in the field of offshore constructions a submerged structure such as breakwaters plays significant role in reducing the wave lodes acting on various marine facilities a significant reason for the construction of submerged breakwaters is that free exchange of water mass through the structures is usually necessary so that the water in the sheltered region can be kept circulating and therefore prevented from pollution scattering of surface waves by a thin vertical barrier submerged in a single layer fluid is considered by dean 1948 ursell 1950 evans 1970 and others for deep water wherein the barrier is either fully submerged and extends infinitely downwards or partially immersed or submerged in an infinitely deep water mciver 1985 exercised the scattering of waves by a pair of surface piercing vertical barriers using a method based on eigenfunction expansions and described a theory to determine the resonant frequencies at which the reflection and transmission coefficient vanish porter and evans 1995 employed method of solving water wave scattering by barriers in a finite depth water based on a galerkin approximation a theoretical study for water wave interaction with a floating body of arbitrary shape in a two layered fluid of finite depth was established by ten and kashiwagi ten and kahiwagi 2004 they proposed an efficient numerical method of evaluating the velocity potentials by boundary integral equation method the scattering of surface water waves by a semi infinite floating membrane due to abrupt change in bottom topography is analyzed using expansion formulae by karmakar and sahoo 2008 barriers considered in the literature described above are impermeable but in case of a permeable structure it has the ability of energy dissipation so that transmission of energy through the barrier are reduced which is of great interest in many ocean engineering applications studies related to water wave scattering by porous barriers have been carried out by a list of researchers a porous wavemaker theory to study the generation of water waves by the harmonic oscillation of a thin porous plate extended from the free surface to the channel bottom in water of finite depth have been introduced by chwang 1983 water wave diffraction by porous breakwaters have been studied by yu 1995 chwang chwang and chan 1998 gave a general review on the interaction between porous media and wave motion their studies focused on the effect of a porous structure on incoming wave trains and the movement of waves past a plate with regular gaps in it using the method of eigenfunction expansion in conjunction with least square approximations lee and chwang 2000 studied water wave scattering and radiation problems they have considered different configurations of the porous barrier sahoo et al sahoo et al 2000 extended the work of lee and chwang 2000 by studding oblique wave scattering by a porous barrier and analyzed the variations of reflection coefficients hydrodynamic pressure differences along the two sides of the barriers and surface elevations for different parameters manam and sahoo 2005 analyzed the scattering of oblique water wave by a fully extended porous barrier in a two layer fluid having a free surface and an interface they used a modified orthogonal relation to solve the problem using eigenfunction expansion method and derived the explicit forms of the reflection and transmission coefficients the scattering of surface wave by a thin permeable flexible barrier in a two layered finite depth fluid with free surface where the barrier is considered to be fixed at two ends have been studied by kumar et al kumar et al 2007 and behera et al behera et al 2013 a hydrodynamic model of perforated or slotted structures have been proposed by molin 2011 and different cases of application are presented two and three dimensional cylinders wave absorbers consisting in perforated plates plates and disks and water entry of perforated wedges behera et al behera et al 2015 investigated the phenomenon of the oblique wave scattering by a rectangular porous structure in two layer finite depth fluid the associated mathematical problem is solved by eigenfunction expansion method a variety of methods such as finite element method eigenfunction expansion method and boundary integral equation method have been used extensively to study water wave scattering by barriers these methods are so efficient that results of many experimental works are compared with theoretical works with success cho and kim 2008 studied the oblique wave interaction with porous plates of different configurations using matched eigenfunction expansion method and boundary element method they have correlated the theoretical results through experiments with horizontal inclined dual porous plates in these methods the inevitable singularities at the end points of the barrier have not been considered martin 1991 developed a method for determining the behavior of the solutions to a hypersingular integral equation near the end points of the interval of integration parsons and martin 1992 1994 have studied the problem of water wave scattering by a vertical plate and a curved plate submerged in a single fluid using hypersingular integral equation over the plate for difference potential this approach has several advantages for instance the radiation condition is automatically satisfied by the choice of green s function similarly the behavior of difference potential at each edge of the plate where there are square root zeros can be easily enforced moreover the method is applicable to curved plates as well as flat plates in fact apart from some simple quadratures the only approximation required is that of a bounded function defined on a finite interval this can be done by choosing an appropriate set of orthogonal polynomials namely chebyshev polynomials of the second kind and then using a collocation method on the governing integral equation using hypersingular integral equation approach the problem of wave scattering by a porous plate in a singe layered fluid was studied by gayen and mondal 2014 mandal et al 1995 considered two superposed fluids of infinite depth and a thin vertical barrier of infinite length submerged completely in the lower layer dhillon et al 2014 considered the problem of wave scattering by a vertical partially immersed barrier in a fluid consisting of a layer of finite depth bounded above by a free surface and below by an infinite layer of fluid of density greater than the upper layer sarkar et al 2014 developed a mathematical model to investigate the hydrodynamic behavior of a wave energy farm consisting of a large number of oscillating wave surge converters in arbitrary configuration with oblique wave incidence the application of green s integral theorem yields hypersingular integral equations which are then solved by using the chebyshev polynomials of the second kind in the present paper we consider the scattering of water waves by a permeable thin vertical submerged plate in the upper layer of two superposed fluids the upper layer being of finite depth and having a free surface while the lower layer extending finitely as well as infinitely downwards in such a two layer fluid wave can propagate with two wave modes when the density ratio of the fluid is very small one can interpret these different modes very easily for an arbitrary but stable density ratio there is a possibility that some of the energy may transferred from one mode to another due to an obstacle in the wave field by suitable application of green s integral theorem in two fluid regions the problem is formulated as a hypersingular integral equation for difference of potentials across the barrier a collocation method involving chebyshev polynomials of second kind is applied to solve the hypersingular integral equation this reduces the equation to a system of linear equations which can be solved by standard methods the solutions are used to get the reflection and transmission coefficients for incident waves of both the modes the energy conservation relations due to the presence of porous barrier are obtained in two dimensional context the numerical values for the proportion of energy reflected transmitted and dissipated for incident waves two different modes are computed and depicted graphically to demonstrate the effect of depth ratio and porosity of the thin plate the energy conservation relations in a single layer fluid are calculated and analyzed numerically to check the correctness of the numerical results presented here 2 formulation of the problem we consider irrotational motion in a two layered inviscid incompressible and homogeneous fluid of which the upper layer is of density ρ 1 and the lower layer is of density ρ 2 ρ 1 here a two dimensional co ordinate system is chosen in such a way that the y axis is taken vertically downwards with the plane y 0 as the undisturbed free surface and y h denotes the

m b 0 6 a h 0 001 h h 0 95 s 1 to calculate the reflection and transmission coefficients at three different submergence depth namely b h 0 1 0 5 0 9 it can be seen that a 3 4 figure accuracy can be achieved using n 10 while the matched eigenfunction expansion solutions need almost 600 truncated terms to achieve three figure accuracy at best 5 1 2 for two layer infinite depth fluid the effect of

with increasing s while the transmitted energies of modes k and κ are decreasing functions of k b for a particular porosity parameter energy dissipation decreases with increasing s it is observed that the change in fluid density ratio has negligible effect on the reflection and transmission of incident waves the results for the scattering of a normally incident wave by a permeable plate submerged beneath the free surface at a depth a b 0 1 0 3 0 5 are shown in figs 4 5 in fig 4 the transmission coefficients t 1 and t 1 are plotted for three different submergence depth of the plate the graphs showing that pick of t 1 increases while t 1 decreases with increasing value of a b the curves of e 1 r e 1 t e 1 r and e 1 d are drawn against dimensionless wavenumber k b it is observed that e 1 r and e 1 d increases at first with increasing k b until a maximum reached and then decreases as k b increases similarly e 1 t decreases at first and then increases with k b if we compare the values of e 1 t and e 1 t it can observed that the value of transmitted energy corresponding to the free surface mode is larger than the value of transmitted energy corresponding to the interface mode this is plausible because large values of wave number corresponds to short wave which are confined near the free surface are mostly transmitted over the barrier with same wave number figs 6 7 show curves of t 1 t 1 e 1 r e 1 t e 1 r and e 1 d plotted against k b corresponding to different value of the porosity parameters of the thin permeable plate in fig 6 the transmission coefficients versus k b are plotted for different values of porosity parameter it is observed that with an increase in k b initially the transmission coefficient of surface mode decreases and then increases uniformly for larger values of k b the transmission coefficient of internal mode decreases as the value of g increases for incident wave of wavenumber k reflected energy with wave mode k decreases as the porosity of the barrier increase for a particular value of k b this result can be comprehended with the physical intuition that when g increases which will allow more fluid and energy to pass through the barrier and thus the reflection coefficients decrease the graphs of e 1 t shows that the transmitted energy decreases with increasing g when the value of k b is either very small or very large and for some intermediate value of k b the curves increases with increasing k b this behavior is quite natural in presence of porous barrier see lee and chwang 2000 the transmitted energy of mode κ i e e 1 r decreases with increase in porosity parameter g the dissipated energy e 1 d for incidence wave energy with wavenumber k increases with increase in g in fig 8 reflected energies of wavenumber κ transmitted energies of wavenumbers κ and k corresponding to an incident wave of wavenumber κ are shown against k b for various values of density ratio of the fluids it is observed that as density ratio increases the reflected energy of wavenumber κ i e e 2 r and the transmitted energy of wavenumber k i e e 2 t will decrease for a fixed value of k b however the transmitted energy of wavenumber κ i e e 2 t will increase with increasing density ratio as the density ratio increases the amplitude of dissipated energy i e e 2 d due to incident wave of wavenumber κ are increasing up to a certain value of k b and then decrease rapidly the proportion of incident energy of wavenumber κ reflected transmitted and dissipated by the porous plate are shown in fig 9 at different submergence depth of top end it is observed that the amplitudes of e 2 r e 2 t and e 2 d curves decreases with increasing depth for fixed value of dimensionless wavenumber k b however the amplitudes of e 2 t curves increases with increasing depth in this figure it can be seen that as the barrier approaches the surface it becomes more effective than a totally submerged barrier fig 10 depicted here are the reflected energies of wavenumber κ transmitted energies of wavenumber κ and k and dissipated energies due to incident wave of wavenumber κ versus k b for different values of the porosity parameter g the graphs showing the fact that as the porosity of the plate increase energy reflection and transmission of wavenumber κ and k decreases energy dissipation by the plate increase with increasing g 5 1 3 for two layer finite depth fluid the effects of submergence depth of the plate below the free surface and porosity of the plate in a two layer finite depth fluid are shown in figs 11 and 12 the graphs behave almost same as in case of infinite depth fluid for numerical calculations 10 non propagating modes were taken into account in fig 11 the reflected and dissipated energies are plotted as a function of non dimensional wavenumber k b for different values of a b 0 1 0 3 0 5 for h b 8 5 h b 2 g 0 25 0 25 i and s 0 25 it is observed that the maximum value of energy reflection as well as dissipation decreases with increase in submergence depth so the results in this case are similar for wave scattering by a submerged vertical porous plate in an infinite depth fluid as in fig 3 in fig 12 the reflected and dissipated energies are plotted for different values of porous effect parameter g 0 25 0 5 0 75 it is observed that the reflected energy decreases with an increase in the absolute value of the porous effect parameter g energy dissipation due to increase in the absolute value of g is increasing upto a certain value of k b and then decreasing function of k b as anticipated the results in this case show similar trends to infinite depth fluid due to configuration similarity 5 2 dynamic forces 5 2 1 for two layer infinite depth fluid the magnitude of the horizontal wave force acting on the vertical porous plate is denoted as c f is obtained using the formula see behera and sahoo 2014 121 c f i ρ ω a b f y d y ρ ω k 0 g a b ϕ x x 0 d y where f y ϕ 0 y ϕ 0 y and the value of ρ is appropriately chosen depending on the physical nature of the problem the non dimensional form of the horizontal force coefficient on the vertical porous plate is given by 122 k f c f ρ 2 g h 2 fig 13 a shows the variation in horizontal force coefficient k f versus k b for different values of the porosity parameter g for incident wave of mode k it is observed that the force acting on the thin porous barrier diminishes with increase in the absolute value of the porosity parameter g which is due to the dissipation of wave energy by the porous barrier as observed in fig 7 5 2 2 for two layer finite depth fluid in this case the non dimensional form of the horizontal force coefficient on the vertical porous plate is given by 123 k f c f ρ 2 g h h the horizontal force coefficient due to the wave force acting on the vertical porous plate in two layer finite depth fluid are depicted against k b for various values of the porosity parameter g and shown in fig 13 b the general pattern of the curves is similar to that of the infinite depth fluid as in fig 13 a both the fig 13 a b the horizontal force increases with increase in k b and attains maximum for certain moderate value of k b further it is seen that for higher values of k b i e in the short wave regime the wave force coefficient k f decreases as k b increases 5 3 approximation for single layer fluid it is possible to derive the results in a single layer fluid by making s 1 in eqn 9 the reflection and transmission coefficients due to the presence of a thin vertical porous barrier in a single layer infinite depth fluid are obtained from 29 and we find that 124 t 1 1 k a b e k y f y d y 125 r 1 k a b e k y f y d y similarly the reflection and transmission coefficients in a single layer fluid of depth h are obtained as 126 t 1 1 2 m cosh m h 2 m h sinh 2 m h a b f y cosh m h y d y 127 r 1 2 m cosh m h 2 m h sinh 2 m h a b f y cosh m h y d y where m satisfies the dispersion equation u sinh u h k cosh u h 0 these are well known results obtained by gayen and mondal 2014 in fig 14 a we plot the data for r 1 as computed by the method of evans 1970 and the present method for the submergence ratio a b 0 05 with s 1 g 0 the data are represented by a solid line and respectively the figure reveal the excellent agreement of evans s results with those obtained by the current work thus we have been successful to provide a straightforward and efficient method to study the effects of a fixed vertical porous barrier on progressive waves in a two layered fluid fig 14 b showing the proportion of incident energy reflected by an impermeable plate in a single layer fluid numerically we let s 1 g 0 amount of energy reflected by the barrier tells the importance of the submergence depth as the value of a b increases the maximum hight of the reflected energy decreases for all wavelength this the obvious since most of the wave transmitted through the gap between the free surface and top of the plate these results ensure the correctness of the present method in fig 15 the reflection coefficient r 1 corresponding to normally incident wave in a singe layered finite depth fluid are plotted at three different values of h b 8 5 2 83 1 7 the graph shows that the agreement between our results with those in gayen and mondal 2014 is highly satisfactory in presence of such type of porous plate the dissipated energies are plotted as a function of k b and the observations are also comprehend with theoretical results 6 conclusion the problem of water wave scattering by a permeable thin vertical plate submerged in upper layer of two superposed fluids is studied the upper fluid is of uniform finite depth bounded by a free surface and a plane interface the depth of the lower fluid is either infinite or finite for such a problem wave can propagate with two wave modes namely surface mode and interface mode along the free surface and the interface respectively green s integral theorem is applied to formulate the problem in terms of hypersingular integral equation for the unknown difference potential across the barrier these difference potentials are approximated by a finite series of chebyshev polynomials for incident wave of both the modes reflection and transmission coefficients are calculated in term of integrals involving difference potentials the proportion of energy reflected and transmitted for an incidence wave are calculated due to the presence of permeable plate the total energy reflected and transmitted is always less than unity the amount of energy dissipated by the plate are also calculated corresponding to the incidence wave of both the wavenumbers the numerical results show that the energy conservation corresponding to different modes depend highly on the position and porosity of the barrier also it is observed that for incidence wave of a particular wavenumber most of the energy transmitted with the same wavenumber the change in density ratio of the fluids have negligible effect on the scattering wave field in presence of the permeable plate the effectiveness of the plate is maximum when it touches the free surface for a fixed value of k b amplitude of the energy reflection of surface mode is lager than that of the energy reflection of internal mode for incidence wave of both the wavenumbers the solutions obtained here telling the fact that in a two layered infinite depth fluid a surface piercing barrier is more effective than a completely submerged plate in terms of energy reflection also a permeable thin plate can be use as a breakwater in a two layered fluid acknowledgments the authors thank the reviewers for their comments and suggestions to revise the paper in the present form this work is partially supported by a

23451,accidents involving vessels and or offshore structures henceforth referred to as marine structures may pose high financial environmental and fatality risk to effectively manage these risks a methodical approach is required to model accident load and the stochastic behaviour of the marine structure that are arising from storm effects this paper introduces a proactive framework that identifies and considers all the initial relevant risks compared to the conventional approaches that rely on precursor data for accident modelling the developed methodology utilizes the critical stochastic variables directly from the hydrodynamic analysis of the floating structure for this purpose a novel numerical model is proposed to replicate a storm based on endurance wave analysis ewa method this approach reduces the computational cost time and load of the simulations the critical stochastic variables are subsequently used in bayesian network bn to develop the risk model the ewa and bn based integrated methodology assists in better understanding of accident causation and associated risk in changing operational conditions the application of the methodology is demonstrated

environment may pose various major risks in terms of environmental pollution and loss of assets for companies in the majority of cases such as exploration of oil and gas reserves and marine transportation this industry also engages with human life where accidents may cause human casualties therefore a great deal of research on the improvement of marine safety is carried out to mitigate the associated risks it is also necessary to take into account the process of risk escalation in a more realistic way rather than relying only on either precursor data or expert judgments this requires a comprehensive approach when it comes to accident modelling and risk analysis of marine floating systems however due to irregularities in the sea environment the nonlinear dynamics of floating system should be taken into consideration when developing a reliable measure of safety catastrophic hurricanes such as ivan katrina and rita in the gulf of mexico highlighted the importance of considering the impact from extreme environmental loads on all types of offshore structures a large number of marine accidents such as extreme responses of vessels encountering rough sea waves have occurred due to harsh environment for instance the mediterranean sea migrant shipwreck and the demas victory a dubai based supply ship that sank off the coast in rough seas townsend 2015 these accidents resulted in at least 150 casualities reflecting the detrimental consequences of such disasters on human life review of recent maritime disasters confirms that there is a lack of a framework that enables making the optimum decision in case floating structures are about to capsize montewka et al 2014 the critical question is how the safety of the crew on board can be improved during a marine accident and how they should manage the situation to survive that is if the operating crew were to be supported with a risk assessment tool that uses the responses of the vessel in different conditions for predicting survivability they would be able to decide whether to ask for rescue or immediately evacuate the vessel before the accident occurs most of the existing risk assessment models are based on historical data obtained from previous marine accidents and thus they can be considered reactive instead of proactive montewka et al 2014 for example papanikolaou and eliopoulou 2008 and konovessis and vassalos 2008 conducted a risk evaluation study based on regulations and worldwide accident experiences from 1994 to 2004 respectively to maximize marine transportation safety with the similar objective a number of studies have been conducted by previous researchers for improving the level of safety in floating structures guarin et al 2009 mermiris et al 2008 papanikolaou et al 2010 2012 trucco et al 2008 recently montewka et al 2014 introduced a systematic framework to estimate the risk for maritime transportation systems with regard to risk escalation based on proactive approaches however their method did not consider the associated risks that arose due to harsh environment such as extreme wave loads there is also no robust tool available to investigate the effect of floating systems responses on human actions on boards during storm conditions this motivation will then be reason to investigate the causality of possible accident scenarios in marine harsh environment by the means of advanced probabilistic model for this purpose it is essential to integrate the recent approaches of non linear dynamic analysis of floating structures with advanced probabilistic models to develop a strong risk assessment tool for improving the safety of marine operations in a harsh environment for the sake of risk aseessment and decision making application of several methods were found in the literature among which maximum likelihood estimation mle and bayesian statistics are recommended for reliability analysis sørensen 2004 to perform a risk based decision making bayesian network bn are increasingly used due to their advantages over other methods such as fault tree analysis fta as discussed by khakzad et al 2011 friis hansen 2000 straub 2004 tavner et al 2007 there are three main reasons that bayesian approaches have been adopted by previous researches firstly this probabilistic model is a promising tool in risk and reliability engineering that allows the comprehensive reflection of available knowledge about the process arzaghi et al 2017 abaei et al 2017 groth et al 2010 khakzad et al 2011 montewka et al 2014 musharraf et al 2014 trucco et al 2008 secondly in comparison to other tools such as analytic hierarchy process ahp bn performs better in solving decision making problems when extended to an influence diagram daniel 2009 friis hansen 2000 thirdly in a bayesian approach it is also possible to convert continuous random variables into a discrete space enabling the inference of more complicated stochastic relationships amongst many parameters friis hansen 2000 that is each variable involved in the problem can be analyzed explicitly rather than in a binary space true or false to develop a risk assessment and decision making framework an optimum method is required for generating the data that represents the stochastic behaviour of the structure in storm condition conventional dynamic analysis of marine structure is a time consuming approach as it needs a longer simulation time to generate data for conducting statistical analysis agarwal and manuel 2009 as an example chen and moan 2004 carried out a study with twenty different 3 h time domain simulations to extract the time series of the structure responses it is therefore necessary to rely on a method that reduces the simulation time for more efficent analysis recently endurance time analysis eta method was developed by riahi et al 2009 and later improved by riahi and estekanchi 2010 to reduce the computational cost of simulation times engineering demand parameters edps such as stress in structural members were investigated through the time domain records zeinoddini et al 2012 results of the studies carried out by estekanchi et al 2007 2011 and riahi and estekanchi 2010 demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of this method over conventional methods in the dynamic evaluation of structures during natural disasters such as earthquakes therefore considering bn as a probabilistic model and eta as an efficient tool for dynamic analysis of the structure an integration of theses method should be provided for effective risk assessment based on this this paper aims at developing a robust methodology to improve safety during marine operations the study will focus on developing a hydrodynamic model to simulate a real condition of the vessel while encountering a storm therefore other events such as loss of communication or loss of engine are not considered in the proposed framework since the dynamic behaviour of the structure is the key point of a marine accident this methodology utilizes the stochastic nature of the critical response variables of a floating unit the critical response variables are integrated in the bn to model the structure s failure the developed bn is then extended to an influence diagram id for risk assessment purposes to illustrate the effectiveness of the methodology a floating storage unit fsu is considered the remainder of this paper is divided into the following sections section 2 explains the concept of critical response variables in evolving operational conditions section 3 an introduction to bn and id is presented section 4 discusses the developed methodology and its elements section 5 demonstrates the application of the methodology in a real case study and section 6 concludes the paper providing the main findings and recommendations for possible future studies 2 response of the critical variables using endurance wave analysis ewa is a simulation based approach that evaluates the hydrodynamic performance of offshore structures when encountering a wave profile with stepwise increases in the wave height in ewa method different sea states are provided in a single time domain by introducing an intensifying constraint new wave icnw function accordingly this approach can be adopted for simulating the increasing trend of storms levels over time which go well beyond the design sea state accounting for the random nature of sea waves fig 1 illustrates the three different levels of icnw profile with different sea states that are adopted for the hydrodynamic simulations of the floating structure at the beginning the structure is subjected to a time history of a wave load corresponding to a certain significant wave height hs and peak spectral period tp derived from the first and lowest level of sea state associated with its sea spectrum s1 w since the amplitude of the excitation is quite low the structure remains stable while experiencing this loading case 1 in the second stage the significant wave height is increased linearly for the same time duration as case 1 at some point during this stage of storm the structure will exceed its survival limit causing an intolerable situation for the crew on board case 2 in the last stage the excitation becomes severe such that the floating structure is anticipated to capsize case 3 ewa will help to evaluate the performance of the structure for any desired level of storm conditions and useful reasonable edps for future risk assessment and decision making processes 2 1 intensifying constrained new wave model icnwm to model the time history of a storm different sea spectra with m separate time series of stepwise icnw functions will be considered with constant duration time td the kth step profile η r k t represents the sea state k 1 k m which is itself constructed based on the wave energy density spectrum s k ω at a specific site the kth step covers a time period of k 1 t d t k t d by increasing stepwise the level of wave spectrum through different steps with a linear trend as k increases from 1 to n the intensifying storm profile will be generated the first generation of icnw in which the growth function is linear can be expressed as follows diznab et al 2014 zeinoddini et al 2012 1 η i c n w t η r 1 t ρ 1 t α 1 η r 1 t c ρ 1 t λ 1 2 η r 1 t c 0 t

n 1 t d t n t d s n ω where η i c n w is the surface elevation of icnw η r i t is the wave profile representing ith storm level t d is the constant period of time that storm will generate to observe extreme wave heights k represents the kth wave profile α k is the crest elevation defined as α k β h max k h m a x k which is the most probable maximum wave height in the sea state k can be expressed by h max k 0 707 h s k ln n w sorensen 2006 where n w is the number of wave cycles during the storm period t d the value of β coefficient that refers to maximum wave height in each sea spectrum when using jonswap spectrum has been considered as β 0 58 zeinoddini et al 2012 time dependent parameters ρ k t and ρ k t are the unit new wave and its slope autocorrelation function respectively λ k 2 is obtained from the second spectral moment and variance of the wave energy spectrum λ k 2 m 2 k σ k 2 η r k t is an irregular sea wave for each wave profile by considering the characteristics of the sea waves at a specific site the minimum required duration time of each storm level t d should be defined to develop the storm profile in this study a duration of 100 s is adopted to ensure a wave profile with all possible wave heights is developed during the storm 3 application of bayesian network in accident modelling bn is a graphical model for reasoning under uncertainty that uses causal relationships represented by directed edges among components of a system represented by chance nodes bn estimates the joint probability distribution of a set of random variables based on the conditional independencies and the chain rule as stated in eq 2 an extensive review of bn and probabilistic knowledge elicitation including its applications in risk and reliability analysis is provided by barber 2012 scutari 2014 and benson 2015 2 p x 1 x 2 x n π i 1 n p x i p a x i where p a x i is the parent set of variable x i as an example the joint probability distribution of the random variables x 1 x 4 shown in fig 2 is estimated by p x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 p x 1 p x 2 p x 3 x 1 x 2 p x 4 x 3 x 2 in case new information becomes available for one or more chance nodes bn is able to update the joint probability based on the bayes theorem 3 p x e p x e x p x e friis hansen 2000 provides a more detailed explanation of bn concepts and its inference algorithms the application of bn in the field of risk and reliability is explored by many researchers a few recent examples include abbassi et al 2016 bhandari et al 2016 yeo et al 2016 as an extension to bn an influence diagram id is proposed for the ease of probabilistic decision making the id connects decision and utility nodes to the network see fig 2 decision nodes hold a number of decision alternatives considered by the user the parents of a decision node provide the information required for making the decision node therefore the edge pointing to a decision node is an information arc instead of a probabilistic dependence friis hansen 2000 consisting of numeric values rather than probabilities utility nodes demonstrate the decision maker s preference over each configuration of a decision alternative for instance if there exist n states for node x 4 and m alternatives for the decision node the utility table requires n m numeric values the expected utility of decision alternative d i is then estimated using eq 4 the alternative with maximum expected utility will be the optimum decision 4 e u d i x 4 p x 4 d i u d i x 4 these utility values are determined based on experts knowledge or utility functions jensen and nielsen 2007 provide extensive information about influence diagrams to name a few nielsen and sørensen 2010 used id to develop a decision making tool for optimizing the operation and maintenance o m costs of offshore wind turbines eleye datubo et al 2006 illustrated the applicability of bn and id in decision making problems through a marine vessel evacuation in an accident and a collision scenario of an offshore structure they asserted that id could assist in integration of a large number of interacting issues and their effects on the decision they also reported that by providing practical solutions for optimization tasks ids can be used as robust marine decision support tools 4 the proposed methodology the methodology proposed here is a robust risk assessment tool with the aim of improving safety during the operation of a marine floating structure this tool will assist the operators in taking the optimum action with respect to the survival condition of the structure while encountering evolving conditions such as storm the outcome of the proposed methodology will assist the vessel operators to mitigate the risk of loss of human life this methodology consists of three different steps as presented in fig 3 these steps are discussed in the following sections 4 1 hydrodynamic modelling step 1 to conduct a comprehensive risk and reliability assessment of marine floating structures in severe environmental conditions it is necessary to analyze the stochastic behaviour of the structure in various sea states in this way for statistical extrapolation a large number of time domain simulations is essential to evaluate extreme loads affecting the system the first phase of this methodology focuses on hydrodynamic modelling of the floating structure subjected to a storm this will generate essential data for investigating the performance of structure stochastically and will be used as the basis for developing the risk assessment tool for this purpose ewa method is employed for developing icnw function for two reasons 1 to minimize the duration of the hydrodynamic time domain simulation by presenting a unique wave train function and 2 to reduce the extent of edp data necessary for risk assessment and future decision making therefore the dynamic behaviour of the system can be evaluated stochastically with only one simulation time which is computationally more efficient the results of this step are then adopted for estimating the edp for each storm level and further used as the input for the second and third part of the methodology the fundamentals of ewa method are discussed in section 2 clarifying the hydrodynamic theories used in this paper 4 2 risk model and decision analysis steps 2 and 3 the second and third step of the study is devoted to the risk model development and conducting probabilistic analysis of the edps and long term prediction of storm conditions the simulation data obtained during the hydrodynamic analysis will be employed to estimate the probability of failure a floating structure a statistical analysis is performed to define a suitable probability density function for each edp maximum likelihood estimation mle method is then applied to estimate the distribution parameters such as shape and scale factor for each case to investigate the effect of different levels of storm on edps a probabilistic network is developed using bn approach in this study to conduct the probability analysis using bn genie software is employed in order to improve the safety of crew on a floating structure that may experience extreme environmental loads it is necessary to consider the most critical scenarios in which the structure may have intolerable conditions for humans to stay on board or it may even capsize moreover it is crucial to evaluate the safety structure both in intact and flooded condition for various angles of incident wave analyzing the effect of edp variations on the decision making process in order to reflect these concerns this methodology aims to determine 1 which level of storm is the most critical condition during the operation 2 what is the optimum decision alternative that should be taken by the operators during the storm condition for this purpose three alternatives are assigned for decision making including a halting the operation and staying on board b requesting help from a rescue helicopter or a vessel c evacuating the floating structure urgently the bn will be able to evaluate extreme response of the structure encountering the storm from different angles of attack in both intact and flooded condition the developed bn enhanced for decision making process is represented in fig 4 node hs represents the long term probability of each sea state corresponding to ith sea spectrum s i ω while node hstorm incorporates the probability of different levels of storm defined by icnw profile nodes fr1 fr2 frn and ir1 ir2 irn represent the probability of edps exceeding their critical limits survival and capsizing criteria nodes fd1 fd2 fdn and id1 id2 idn incorporate the different decision alternatives that operators may take for mitigating the risk of fatality nodes fu1 fu2 fun and iu1 iu2 iun include the assigned utilities based on the preference of operators over the decision alternatives and possible responses of the structure 5 case study a floating storage unit fsu in the north sea under storm 5 1 scenario development to demonstrate the application of developed methodology a case study is adopted for evacuation of sevan 1000 floating storage unit fsu encountering a storm this structure is designed to operate in the mariner field in the north sea hanssen 2013 the structure is a storage unit incorporating a main hull with overall length of 85 m and draft of 30 m previously the hydrodynamic characteristic of this unit has been investigated through conventional methods focusing on its performance in operational and survival condition anundsen 2008 hanssen 2013 in the present paper however sevan hull is selected for risk assessment and modelling failure due to extreme environmental loads in this study the structure will be subjected to a simulated storm causing it to become susceptible to capsizing the method will identify the most efficient action that the operators may take for saving the crew s safely 5 2 developing icnw storm profile in order to develop the icnw storm wave profile eleven sea state thresholds are considered each of which has a specific long term probability of occurrence a three parameter weibull distribution is adopted for the selected north sea site to model the long term probability of significant wave heights as recommended by karadeniz et al 1983 siddiqui and ahmad 2000 and karimirad and moan 2013 the sea states used in implementing the icnw profile as well as the discretized probabilities of each sea state are presented in table 1 the operational and survival limits for fsu operation based on the suggestions by anundsen 2008 are summarized in table 2 the term operation here is an indication of the voyaging i e general motion of the vessel by using the icnw profile and considering these operational safety limits risk escalation processes will be employed to evaluate the performance of the structure under different levels of storm to model the random and irregular nature of sea wave elevations jonswap spectrum is used moreover to show the advantage of this method in reducing the simulation time the superimposed conventional random sea elevation rse is compared with icnw as presented in fig 5 as illustrated in fig 6 the rse profile needs more simulation time to observe the extreme wave heights it is usual to conduct 3 h simulations for each sea state to observe desired extreme wave heights as recommended by chen and moan 2004 ren et al 2015 veritas 2007 that is for each sea state eleven 3 h simulations are needed to obtain a realistic representation of storm however to generate icnw profile for this site only 1100 s of simulation time is required to capture an extreme storm condition in one individual simulation as an example sea states five and eleven are illustrated individually in fig 5 to emphasize the sharp differences between these two approaches and how the time domain in icnw reaches its highest level in a much shorter time in the figure the corresponding wave spectra for these sea states are shown above the surface elevation profile providing a qualitative representation of eq 1 described in section 2 1 5 3 hydrodynamic analysis two different scenarios are considered to evaluate the hydrodynamic characteristics of the floating structure in the extreme environment first scenario is the intact condition where the floating object is in its upright condition and encounters icnw from different angles of incidents second scenario is the flooded condition in which a constant heel angle is applied to the structure due to a damaged compartment the simulations are then carried out to investigate the performance of the fsu dnv 2001 recommends a ballast compartment with damage penetration zone of 1 5 m constant heel angle of nine degree appeared in the fsu to simulate the flooded condition to explore the dynamic behaviour of the fsu in detail nine different angles of incident waves from zero to 360 with 45 increments are selected in this study orcaflex software is employed to conduct the hydrodynamic analysis for each angle of attack icnw wave profile is inputtted manually in the software to conduct the simulation process the obtained time domain edp data such as roll response is exported to the matlab software for determination of the probability distributions for each simulation the minimum and maximum value of roll motion responses are monitored to recognize the most extreme cases in which the results exceed operational and survival limits to understand the variation of fsu performance in different scenarios and storm angles of attack the results are illustrated in a polar plotted in fig 7 as shown in the figure the maximum roll angle of the intact structure for most of the angle of incident waves will be about 12 which does not significantly exceed the safety limits 9 however in a flooded fsu both maximum and minimum roll angles exceed the survival limit resulting in an unsafe condition for the crew on board it is clear from the figure that 45 270 and 180 are the critical angles of attack for a flooded structure for this reason in the developed bn represented in fig 6 these three angles are considered for flooded condition and correspondingly only one angle is assigned for intact condition the probabilistic analysis of hydrodynamic response required for conducting risk analysis and decision making are explained in more detail in the following section 5 4 define probability distribution of stochastic variables as a requirement of any risk assessment and probabilistic decision making process it is essential to determine the performance of the fsu subjected to icnw storm profile in probabilistic terms the results from this part of the study are used for implementing the bn and completing the conditional probability tables cpt in the network firstly extreme values of storm wave height h storm for each different step in the icnw profile should be estimated based on the description of eq 1 in section 2 1 the kth specific step is dependent on the characteristics of the kth sea state consequently storm wave heights are dependent on the significant wave height hs outlining the associated sea state spectrum s k ω based on this concept the cpt for node h storm is completed for each level of storm for this purpose each step in icnw profile is fitted to generalized extreme value gev distribution using mle method ensuring that the possible extreme values are captured the obtained probability density functions pdf for significant wave heights and the pdfs of extreme wave amplitudes during storm are presented in fig 8 and the data is summarized in table 3 probability distribution of the structure s roll angle is computed using the time domain simulation data obtained in section 5 1 1 and considering the most critical scenarios in the performance of fsu is highlighted in fig 7 it is necessary to find the most suitable pdf that accurately represents the stochastic data moreover when a rare accident problem such as extreme roll angle in this study is of interest special attention is needed to predict the response of the structure which also has a small probability of occurrence in previous studies h chen 2003 diznab et al 2014 recommend that gev distribution is the most suitable function for predicting the long term characteristic of a marine structure s response under extreme loads however for this study gev failed to provide an accurate prediction of the pdf according to stochastic time domain data the reason is that t location scale distribution shows better agreement for heavier tail functions to model more realistically phenomenon such as the stochastic process of the present study in order to find the optimum case a number of distribution functions were explored and mle method was applied to find the distribution parameters such as shape and scale of each case a comparison between gev and t location scale distribution is shown in fig 9 it is clear that gev has failed to model the occurrence probability of roll particularly for extreme responses roll angle 20 caused by the storm while t location scale distribution performs better at modelling those responses similarly the response data for 180 and 45 of incident wave angle is fitted to t location scale distribution from which the obtained pdfs are presented in fig 10 respectively table 4 also summarizes the t location scale parameters estimated by mle to fit simulation data of flooded condition in order to investigate the effect of damage on the performance of the structure a comparison of extreme roll responses between flooded and intact condition for the most critical scenario 45 as illustrated in fig 7 is conducted and represented in fig 10 as shown in this figure the range of roll angle in intact condition is considerably smaller than the variations in flooded condition the range of rolling motion in the intact condition is less than 15 however in a flooded condition it is anticipated to be more than 20 that is the possibility of encountering much larger roll angles in the extreme condition will increase drastically for a flooded structure 5 5 probabilistic model and decision making scenario estimated probability density function of roll angle are fed to the bn nodes such as node fr45 to fill the utility and decision nodes such as fu45 and fd45 it is necessary to define the criteria that identifies the level of risk in each storm condition and possible extreme roll response of the fsu according to the survival limit presented in table 2 this criterion is a roll angle of nine degree θ 1 9 0 if the fsu s roll angle is lower than this the best action is to halt the operation however if the roll angle exceeds this limit then the system is not tolerable for the crew on board therefore they should either request help or evacuate the unit to make this clear to find the best action as the level of storm becomes more severe another criterion needs to be defined according to iacs 2012 the range of stability ros in damage condition for floating unit is described as 5 r o s θ m θ s m a x 7 0 1 5 θ s 10 0 where θm is the maximum angle of positive stability maximum angle of positive stability in intact condition for this floating unit is θ m 50 0 and θs is the static angle of inclination after damage which is nine degrees in this study see 5 1 1 therefore the second criterion is assigned as θ 2 θ m if the fsu roll angle exceeds θm in any scenario then the vessel is about to capsize therefore humans on board should evacuate the vessel urgently rather than asking for help considering these aspect three alternatives are defined for decision nodes a halt the operation and stay if θ θ 1 b request help to be picked up by helicopter or vessel if θ 1 θ θ m c evacuate the floating system urgently as the structure is about to capsize if θ θ m to compute the expected utility these criteria were taken into consideration to assign for utility nodes the values are selected based on the decision alternatives and possible losses according to the random behaviour of the vessel in storm condition the cost associated with each decision alternative is estimated based on data available about the technical characteristics of the structure as well as the price and cost details of operational actions such as request for help from onshore počuča 2006 the operational cost of such structures is mainly divided into six categories including fuel and consumables crew salary lubes and stores maintenance cost insurance and administration kay et al 2011 however in the case of decision making about survivability of the structure other costs such as the rescue cost and the loss of capital due to evacuation need to be considered in the present study the cost profile is carefully derived from the accidents and operational databases and consultations with the experts in the field kay et al 2011 stopford 2009 zei 2006 this resulted in assigning 1 k 10 k and 105 k for the cost of halting the operation requesting help and evacuating the facility respectively since this study is focused on human safety on board any fatalities result in financial loss of 109 k according to the total cost associated with value of life recommended by kip viscusi 2005 this value is applied to justify an investment of a protection measure to avert the loss of a life and the material loss up to that order to prevent a life lost therefore due to saving human life as a priority compared to other associated cost the value of human loss is considered to be a notably larger value this will demonstrate that in the final estimation of maximum expected utility a higher level of human safety will be achieved consequently the expected value of each decision alternative is computed based on the occurrence probability of extreme roll response and utility values assigned see eq 4 and fig 6 a comparison of the estimated expected values of all decision alternatives for different incident storm angle of attack are presented in fig 11 as illustrated in the graphs if the floating unit is in intact condition it can tolerate all ranges of the storm condition therefore there will be no concern about staying on board on the other hand in the case that the structure is flooded the safety of the crew is dependent on the wave angle of attack the results show if the storm attacks the structure with angles of 45 and 270 the captain should request help as the storm intensity is around a significant wave height of 5 15 m accordingly when the storm increases its level to hs 8 15 m the crew should evacuate the vessel urgently the situation is more flexible for the case that a flooded structure encounters the storm from the angle of 270 the crew can stay on board while they observe significant wave heights of 8 15 m nevertheless they should request help to survive the severe condition when the storm passes the wave height of hs 14 15 m the crew should evacuate the vessel to save their lives 6 conclusion a methodology is proposed here to assist in efficient and robust decisions to improve safety of the marine structures in evolving operational conditions the methodology is comprised of three main steps firstly the hydrodynamic analysis is conducted upon replicating storm through an intensifying wave train function this approach has the advantage of reducing computation cost of simulations second the appropriate probability distributions of each level of storm and its stochastic parameters are estimated and the performance of floating structure is assessed through a bayesian approach the developed bn is then extended into an id which assists in quick and robust decision making the application and effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through simulating an fsu in storm condition with different angles of attack the results of the analysis indicate that the most critical incident wave angles are 45 180 and 270 degrees in a non flooded condition the structure will be safe in the storm however it is necessary to halt the operation for a flooded fsu evacuation is the optimum decision alternative if the wave heights exceed hs 8 15 m for the incident wave angles of 45 and 180 and hs 14 15 m for 270 these observations highlight the proposed methodology be used as an effective tool for quick and robust decisions it incorporates the uncertainty associated with the dynamic behaviour of a floating structure and also the stochastic nature of operational and marine structure response variables this methodology could be integrated with the e navigational tool to ensure safety at sea 
23451,accidents involving vessels and or offshore structures henceforth referred to as marine structures may pose high financial environmental and fatality risk to effectively manage these risks a methodical approach is required to model accident load and the stochastic behaviour of the marine structure that are arising from storm effects this paper introduces a proactive framework that identifies and considers all the initial relevant risks compared to the conventional approaches that rely on precursor data for accident modelling the developed methodology utilizes the critical stochastic variables directly from the hydrodynamic analysis of the floating structure for this purpose a novel numerical model is proposed to replicate a storm based on endurance wave analysis ewa method this approach reduces the computational cost time and load of the simulations the critical stochastic variables are subsequently used in bayesian network bn to develop the risk model the ewa and bn based integrated methodology assists in better understanding of accident causation and associated risk in changing operational conditions the application of the methodology is demonstrated

conditional probability table pdf probability density function gev generalized extreme value mle maximum likelihood estimation θ roll angle 1 introduction failure in operations conducted in the marine environment may pose various major risks in terms of environmental pollution and loss of assets for companies in the majority of cases such as exploration of oil and gas reserves and marine transportation this industry also engages with human life where accidents may cause human casualties therefore a great deal of research on the improvement of marine safety is carried out to mitigate the associated risks it is also necessary to take into account the process of risk escalation in a more realistic way rather than relying only on either precursor data or expert judgments this requires a comprehensive approach when it comes to accident modelling and risk analysis of marine floating systems however due to irregularities in the sea environment the nonlinear dynamics of floating system should be taken into consideration when developing a reliable measure of safety catastrophic hurricanes such as ivan katrina and rita in the gulf of mexico highlighted the importance of considering the impact from extreme environmental loads on all types of offshore structures a large number of marine accidents such as extreme responses of vessels encountering rough sea waves have occurred due to harsh environment for instance the mediterranean sea migrant shipwreck and the demas victory a dubai based supply ship that sank off the coast in rough seas townsend 2015 these accidents resulted in at least 150 casualities reflecting the detrimental consequences of such disasters on human life review of recent maritime disasters confirms that there is a lack of a framework that enables making the optimum decision in case floating structures are about to capsize montewka et al 2014 the critical question is how the safety of the crew on board can be improved during a marine accident and how they should manage the situation to survive that is if the operating crew were to be supported with a risk assessment tool that uses the responses of the vessel in different conditions for predicting survivability they would be able to decide whether to ask for rescue or immediately evacuate the vessel before the accident occurs most of the existing risk assessment models are based on historical data obtained from previous marine accidents and thus they can be considered reactive instead of proactive montewka et al 2014 for example papanikolaou and eliopoulou 2008 and konovessis and vassalos 2008 conducted a risk evaluation study based on regulations and worldwide accident experiences from 1994 to 2004 respectively to maximize marine transportation safety with the similar objective a number of studies have been conducted by previous researchers for improving the level of safety in floating structures guarin et al 2009 mermiris et al 2008 papanikolaou et al 2010 2012 trucco et al 2008 recently montewka et al 2014 introduced a systematic framework to estimate the risk for maritime transportation systems with regard to risk escalation based on proactive approaches however their method did not consider the associated risks that arose due to harsh environment such as extreme wave loads there is also no robust tool available to investigate the effect of floating systems responses on human actions on boards during storm conditions this motivation will then be reason to investigate the causality of possible accident scenarios in marine harsh environment by the means of advanced probabilistic model for this purpose it is essential to integrate the recent approaches of non linear dynamic analysis of floating structures with advanced probabilistic models to develop a strong risk assessment tool for improving the safety of marine operations in a harsh environment for the sake of risk aseessment and decision making application of several methods were found in the literature among which maximum likelihood estimation mle and bayesian statistics are recommended for reliability analysis sørensen 2004 to perform a risk based decision making bayesian network bn are increasingly used due to their advantages over other methods such as fault tree analysis fta as discussed by khakzad et al 2011 friis hansen 2000 straub 2004 tavner et al 2007 there are three main reasons that bayesian approaches have been adopted by previous researches firstly this probabilistic model is a promising tool in risk and reliability engineering that allows the comprehensive reflection of available knowledge about the process arzaghi et al 2017 abaei et al 2017 groth et al 2010 khakzad et al 2011 montewka et al 2014 musharraf et al 2014 trucco et al 2008 secondly in comparison to other tools such as analytic hierarchy process ahp bn performs better in solving decision making problems when extended to an influence diagram daniel 2009 friis hansen 2000 thirdly in a bayesian approach it is also possible to convert continuous random variables into a discrete space enabling the inference of more complicated stochastic relationships amongst many parameters friis hansen 2000 that is each variable involved in the problem can be analyzed explicitly rather than in a binary space true or false to develop a risk assessment and decision making framework an optimum method is required for generating the data that represents the stochastic behaviour of the structure in storm condition conventional dynamic analysis of marine structure is a time consuming approach as it needs a longer simulation time to generate data for conducting statistical analysis agarwal and manuel 2009 as an example chen and moan 2004 carried out a study with twenty different 3 h time domain simulations to extract the time series of the structure responses it is therefore necessary to rely on a method that reduces the simulation time for more efficent analysis recently endurance time analysis eta method was developed by riahi et al 2009 and later improved by riahi and estekanchi 2010 to reduce the computational cost of simulation times engineering demand parameters edps such as stress in structural members were investigated through the time domain records zeinoddini et al 2012 results of the studies carried out by estekanchi et al 2007 2011 and riahi and estekanchi 2010 demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of this method over conventional methods in the dynamic evaluation of structures during natural disasters such as earthquakes therefore considering bn as a probabilistic model and eta as an efficient tool for dynamic analysis of the structure an integration of theses method should be provided for effective risk assessment based on this this paper aims at developing a robust methodology to improve safety during marine operations the study will focus on developing a hydrodynamic model to simulate a real condition of the vessel while encountering a storm therefore other events such as loss of communication or loss of engine are not considered in the proposed framework since the dynamic behaviour of the structure is the key point of a marine accident this methodology utilizes the stochastic nature of the critical response variables of a floating unit the critical response variables are integrated in the bn to model the structure s failure the developed bn is then extended to an influence diagram id for risk assessment purposes to illustrate the effectiveness of the methodology a floating storage unit fsu is considered the remainder of this paper is divided into the following sections section 2 explains the concept of critical response variables in evolving operational conditions section 3 an introduction to bn and id is presented section 4 discusses the developed methodology and its elements section 5 demonstrates the application of the methodology in a real case study and section 6 concludes the paper providing the main findings and recommendations for possible future studies 2 response of the critical variables using endurance wave analysis ewa is a simulation based approach that evaluates the hydrodynamic performance of offshore structures when encountering a wave profile with stepwise increases in the wave height in ewa method different sea states are provided in a single time domain by introducing an intensifying constraint new wave icnw function accordingly this approach can be adopted for simulating the increasing trend of storms levels over time which go well beyond the design sea state accounting for the random nature of sea waves fig 1 illustrates the three different levels of icnw profile with different sea states that are adopted for the hydrodynamic simulations of the floating structure at the beginning the structure is subjected to a time history of a wave load corresponding to a certain significant wave height hs and peak spectral period tp derived from the first and lowest level of sea state associated with its sea spectrum s1 w since the amplitude of the excitation is quite low the structure remains stable while experiencing this loading case 1 in the second stage the significant wave height is increased linearly for the same time duration as case 1 at some point during this stage of storm the structure will exceed its survival limit causing an intolerable situation for the crew on board case 2 in the last stage the excitation becomes severe such that the floating structure is anticipated to capsize case 3 ewa will help to evaluate the performance of the structure for any desired level of storm conditions and useful reasonable edps for future risk assessment and decision making processes 2 1 intensifying constrained new wave model icnwm to model the time history of a storm different sea spectra with m separate time series of stepwise icnw functions will be considered with constant duration time td the kth step profile η r k t represents the sea state k 1 k m which is itself constructed based on the wave energy density spectrum s k ω at a specific site the kth step covers a time period of k 1 t d t k t d by increasing stepwise the level of wave spectrum through different steps with a linear trend as k increases from 1 to n the intensifying storm profile will be generated the first generation of icnw in which the growth function is linear can be expressed as follows diznab et al 2014 zeinoddini et al 2012 1 η i c n w t η r 1 t ρ 1 t α 1 η r 1 t c ρ 1 t λ 1 2 η r 1 t c 0 t t d s 1 ω η r 2 t ρ 2 t α 2 η r 2 t c ρ 2 t λ 2 2 η r 2 t c t d t 2 t d s 2 ω η r k t ρ k t α k η r k t c ρ k t λ k 2 η r 1 t c k 1 t d t k t d s k ω η r n t ρ n t α n η r n t c ρ n t λ n 2 η r 1 t c n 1 t d t n t d s n ω where η i c n w is the surface elevation of icnw η r i t is the wave profile representing ith storm level t d is the constant period of time that storm will generate to observe extreme wave heights k represents the kth wave profile α k is the crest elevation defined as α k β h max k h m a x k which is the most probable maximum wave height in the sea state k can be expressed by h max k 0 707 h s k ln n w sorensen 2006 where n w is the number of wave cycles during the storm period t d the value of β coefficient that refers to maximum wave height in each sea spectrum when using jonswap spectrum has been considered as β 0 58 zeinoddini et al 2012 time dependent parameters ρ k t and ρ k t are the unit new wave and its slope autocorrelation function respectively λ k 2 is obtained from the second spectral moment and variance of the wave energy spectrum λ k 2 m 2 k σ k 2 η r k t is an irregular sea wave for each wave profile by considering the characteristics of the sea waves at a specific site the minimum required duration time of each storm level t d should be defined to develop the storm profile in this study a duration of 100 s is adopted to ensure a wave profile with all possible wave heights is developed during the storm 3 application of bayesian network in accident modelling bn is a graphical model for reasoning under uncertainty that uses causal relationships represented by directed edges among components of a system represented by chance nodes bn estimates the joint probability distribution of a set of random variables based on the conditional independencies and the chain rule as stated in eq 2 an extensive review of bn and probabilistic knowledge elicitation including its applications in risk and reliability analysis is provided by barber 2012 scutari 2014 and benson 2015 2 p x 1 x 2 x n π i 1 n p x i p a x i where p a x i is the parent set of variable x i as an example the joint probability distribution of the random variables x 1 x 4 shown in fig 2 is estimated by p x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 p x 1 p x 2 p x 3 x 1 x 2 p x 4 x 3 x 2 in case new information becomes available for one or more chance nodes bn is able to update the joint probability based on the bayes theorem 3 p x e p x e x p x e friis hansen 2000 provides a more detailed explanation of bn concepts and its inference algorithms the application of bn in the field of risk and reliability is explored by many researchers a few recent examples include abbassi et al 2016 bhandari et al 2016 yeo et al 2016 as an extension to bn an influence diagram id is proposed for the ease of probabilistic decision making the id connects decision and utility nodes to the network see fig 2 decision nodes hold a number of decision alternatives considered by the user the parents of a decision node provide the information required for making the decision node therefore the edge pointing to a decision node is an information arc instead of a probabilistic dependence friis hansen 2000 consisting of numeric values rather than probabilities utility nodes demonstrate the decision maker s preference over each configuration of a decision alternative for instance if there exist n states for node x 4 and m alternatives for the decision node the utility table requires n m numeric values the expected utility of decision alternative d i is then estimated using eq 4 the alternative with maximum expected utility will be the optimum decision 4 e u d i x 4 p x 4 d i u d i x 4 these utility values are determined based on experts knowledge or utility functions jensen and nielsen 2007 provide extensive information about influence diagrams to name a few nielsen and sørensen 2010 used id to develop a decision making tool for optimizing the operation and maintenance o m costs of offshore wind turbines eleye datubo et al 2006 illustrated the applicability of bn and id in decision making problems through a marine vessel evacuation in an accident and a collision scenario of an offshore structure they asserted that id could assist in integration of a large number of interacting issues and their effects on the decision they also reported that by providing practical solutions for optimization tasks ids can be used as robust marine decision support tools 4 the proposed methodology the methodology proposed here is a robust risk assessment tool with the aim of improving safety during the operation of a marine floating structure this tool will assist the operators in taking the optimum action with respect to the survival condition of the structure while encountering evolving conditions such as storm the outcome of the proposed methodology will assist the vessel operators to mitigate the risk of loss of human life this methodology consists of three different steps as presented in fig 3 these steps are discussed in the following sections 4 1 hydrodynamic modelling step 1 to conduct a comprehensive risk and reliability assessment of marine floating structures in severe environmental conditions it is necessary to analyze the stochastic behaviour of the structure in various sea states in this way for statistical extrapolation a large number of time domain simulations is essential to evaluate extreme loads affecting the system the first phase of this methodology focuses on hydrodynamic modelling of the floating structure subjected to a storm this will generate essential data for investigating the performance of structure stochastically and will be used as the basis for developing the risk assessment tool for this purpose ewa method is employed for developing icnw function for two reasons 1 to minimize the duration of the hydrodynamic time domain simulation by presenting a unique wave train function and 2 to reduce the extent of edp data necessary for risk assessment and future decision making therefore the dynamic behaviour of the system can be evaluated stochastically with only one simulation time which is computationally more efficient the results of this step are then adopted for estimating the edp for each storm level and further used as the input for the second and third part of the methodology the fundamentals of ewa method are discussed in section 2 clarifying the hydrodynamic theories used in this paper 4 2 risk model and decision analysis steps 2 and 3 the second and third step of the study is devoted to the risk model development and conducting probabilistic analysis of the edps and long term prediction of storm conditions the simulation data obtained during the hydrodynamic analysis will be employed to estimate the probability of failure a floating structure a statistical analysis is performed to define a suitable probability density function for each edp maximum likelihood estimation mle method is then applied to estimate the distribution parameters such as shape and scale factor for each case to investigate the effect of different levels of storm on edps a probabilistic network is developed using bn approach in this study to conduct the probability analysis using bn genie software is employed in order to improve the safety of crew on a floating structure that may experience extreme environmental loads it is necessary to consider the most critical scenarios in which the structure may have intolerable conditions for humans to stay on board or it may even capsize moreover it is crucial to evaluate the safety structure both in intact and flooded condition for various angles of incident wave analyzing the effect of edp variations on the decision making process in order to reflect these concerns this methodology aims to determine 1 which level of storm is the most critical condition during the operation 2 what is the optimum decision alternative that should be taken by the operators during the storm condition for this purpose three alternatives are assigned for decision making including a halting the operation and staying on board b requesting help from a rescue helicopter or a vessel c evacuating the floating structure urgently the bn will be able to evaluate extreme response of the structure encountering the storm from different angles of attack in both intact and flooded condition the developed bn enhanced for decision making process is represented in fig 4 node hs represents the long term probability of each sea state corresponding to ith sea spectrum s i ω while node hstorm incorporates the probability of different levels of storm defined by icnw profile nodes fr1 fr2 frn and ir1 ir2 irn represent the probability of edps exceeding their critical limits survival and capsizing criteria nodes fd1 fd2 fdn and id1 id2 idn incorporate the different decision alternatives that operators may take for mitigating the risk of fatality nodes fu1 fu2 fun and iu1 iu2 iun include the assigned utilities based on the preference of operators over the decision alternatives and possible responses of the structure 5 case study a floating storage unit fsu in the north sea under storm 5 1 scenario development to demonstrate the application of developed methodology a case study is adopted for evacuation of sevan 1000 floating storage unit fsu encountering a storm this structure is designed to operate in the mariner field in the north sea hanssen 2013 the structure is a storage unit incorporating a main hull with overall length of 85 m and draft of 30 m previously the hydrodynamic characteristic of this unit has been investigated through conventional methods focusing on its performance in operational and survival condition anundsen 2008 hanssen 2013 in the present paper however sevan hull is selected for risk assessment and modelling failure due to extreme environmental loads in this study the structure will be subjected to a simulated storm causing it to become susceptible to capsizing the method will identify the most efficient action that the operators may take for saving the crew s safely 5 2 developing icnw storm profile in order to develop the icnw storm wave profile eleven sea state thresholds are considered each of which has a specific long term probability of occurrence a three parameter weibull distribution is adopted for the selected north sea site to model the long term probability of significant wave heights as recommended by karadeniz et al 1983 siddiqui and ahmad 2000 and karimirad and moan 2013 the sea states used in implementing the icnw profile as well as the discretized probabilities of each sea state are presented in table 1 the operational and survival limits for fsu operation based on the suggestions by anundsen 2008 are summarized in table 2 the term operation here is an indication of the voyaging i e general motion of the vessel by using the icnw profile and considering these operational safety limits risk escalation processes will be employed to evaluate the performance of the structure under different levels of storm to model the random and irregular nature of sea wave elevations jonswap spectrum is used moreover to show the advantage of this method in reducing the simulation time the superimposed conventional random sea elevation rse is compared with icnw as presented in fig 5 as illustrated in fig 6 the rse profile needs more simulation time to observe the extreme wave heights it is usual to conduct 3 h simulations for each sea state to observe desired extreme wave heights as recommended by chen and moan 2004 ren et al 2015 veritas 2007 that is for each sea state eleven 3 h simulations are needed to obtain a realistic representation of storm however to generate icnw profile for this site only 1100 s of simulation time is required to capture an extreme storm condition in one individual simulation as an example sea states five and eleven are illustrated individually in fig 5 to emphasize the sharp differences between these two approaches and how the time domain in icnw reaches its highest level in a much shorter time in the figure the corresponding wave spectra for these sea states are shown above the surface elevation profile providing a qualitative representation of eq 1 described in section 2 1 5 3 hydrodynamic analysis two different scenarios are considered to evaluate the hydrodynamic characteristics of the floating structure in the extreme environment first scenario is the intact condition where the floating object is in its upright condition and encounters icnw from different angles of incidents second scenario is the flooded condition in which a constant heel angle is applied to the structure due to a damaged compartment the simulations are then carried out to investigate the performance of the fsu dnv 2001 recommends a ballast compartment with damage penetration zone of 1 5 m constant heel angle of nine degree appeared in the fsu to simulate the flooded condition to explore the dynamic behaviour of the fsu in detail nine different angles of incident waves from zero to 360 with 45 increments are selected in this study orcaflex software is employed to conduct the hydrodynamic analysis for each angle of attack icnw wave profile is inputtted manually in the software to conduct the simulation process the obtained time domain edp data such as roll response is exported to the matlab software for determination of the probability distributions for each simulation the minimum and maximum value of roll motion responses are monitored to recognize the most extreme cases in which the results exceed operational and survival limits to understand the variation of fsu performance in different scenarios and storm angles of attack the results are illustrated in a polar plotted in fig 7 as shown in the figure the maximum roll angle of the intact structure for most of the angle of incident waves will be about 12 which does not significantly exceed the safety limits 9 however in a flooded fsu both maximum and minimum roll angles exceed the survival limit resulting in an unsafe condition for the crew on board it is clear from the figure that 45 270 and 180 are the critical angles of attack for a flooded structure for this reason in the developed bn represented in fig 6 these three angles are considered for flooded condition and correspondingly only one angle is assigned for intact condition the probabilistic analysis of hydrodynamic response required for conducting risk analysis and decision making are explained in more detail in the following section 5 4 define probability distribution of stochastic variables as a requirement of any risk assessment and probabilistic decision making process it is essential to determine the performance of the fsu subjected to icnw storm profile in probabilistic terms the results from this part of the study are used for implementing the bn and completing the conditional probability tables cpt in the network firstly extreme values of storm wave height h storm for each different step in the icnw profile should be estimated based on the description of eq 1 in section 2 1 the kth specific step is dependent on the characteristics of the kth sea state consequently storm wave heights are dependent on the significant wave height hs outlining the associated sea state spectrum s k ω based on this concept the cpt for node h storm is completed for each level of storm for this purpose each step in icnw profile is fitted to generalized extreme value gev distribution using mle method ensuring that the possible extreme values are captured the obtained probability density functions pdf for significant wave heights and the pdfs of extreme wave amplitudes during storm are presented in fig 8 and the data is summarized in table 3 probability distribution of the structure s roll angle is computed using the time domain simulation data obtained in section 5 1 1 and considering the most critical scenarios in the performance of fsu is highlighted in fig 7 it is necessary to find the most suitable pdf that accurately represents the stochastic data moreover when a rare accident problem such as extreme roll angle in this study is of interest special attention is needed to predict the response of the structure which also has a small probability of occurrence in previous studies h chen 2003 diznab et al 2014 recommend that gev distribution is the most suitable function for predicting the long term characteristic of a marine structure s response under extreme loads however for this study gev failed to provide an accurate prediction of the pdf according to stochastic time domain data the reason is that t location scale distribution shows better agreement for heavier tail functions to model more realistically phenomenon such as the stochastic process of the present study in order to find the optimum case a number of distribution functions were explored and mle method was applied to find the distribution parameters such as shape and scale of each case a comparison between gev and t location scale distribution is shown in fig 9 it is clear that gev has failed to model the occurrence probability of roll particularly for extreme responses roll angle 20 caused by the storm while t location scale distribution performs better at modelling those responses similarly the response data for 180 and 45 of incident wave angle is fitted to t location scale distribution from which the obtained pdfs are presented in fig 10 respectively table 4 also summarizes the t location scale parameters estimated by mle to fit simulation data of flooded condition in order to investigate the effect of damage on the performance of the structure a comparison of extreme roll responses between flooded and intact condition for the most critical scenario 45 as illustrated in fig 7 is conducted and represented in fig 10 as shown in this figure the range of roll angle in intact condition is considerably smaller than the variations in flooded condition the range of rolling motion in the intact condition is less than 15 however in a flooded condition it is anticipated to be more than 20 that is the possibility of encountering much larger roll angles in the extreme condition will increase drastically for a flooded structure 5 5 probabilistic model and decision making scenario estimated probability density function of roll angle are fed to the bn nodes such as node fr45 to fill the utility and decision nodes such as fu45 and fd45 it is necessary to define the criteria that identifies the level of risk in each storm condition and possible extreme roll response of the fsu according to the survival limit presented in table 2 this criterion is a roll angle of nine degree θ 1 9 0 if the fsu s roll angle is lower than this the best action is to halt the operation however if the roll angle exceeds this limit then the system is not tolerable for the crew on board therefore they should either request help or evacuate the unit to make this clear to find the best action as the level of storm becomes more severe another criterion needs to be defined according to iacs 2012 the range of stability ros in damage condition for floating unit is described as 5 r o s θ m θ s m a x 7 0 1 5 θ s 10 0 where θm is the maximum angle of positive stability maximum angle of positive stability in intact condition for this floating unit is θ m 50 0 and θs is the static angle of inclination after damage which is nine degrees in this study see 5 1 1 therefore the second criterion is assigned as θ 2 θ m if the fsu roll angle exceeds θm in any scenario then the vessel is about to capsize therefore humans on board should evacuate the vessel urgently rather than asking for help considering these aspect three alternatives are defined for decision nodes a halt the operation and stay if θ θ 1 b request help to be picked up by helicopter or vessel if θ 1 θ θ m c evacuate the floating system urgently as the structure is about to capsize if θ θ m to compute the expected utility these criteria were taken into consideration to assign for utility nodes the values are selected based on the decision alternatives and possible losses according to the random behaviour of the vessel in storm condition the cost associated with each decision alternative is estimated based on data available about the technical characteristics of the structure as well as the price and cost details of operational actions such as request for help from onshore počuča 2006 the operational cost of such structures is mainly divided into six categories including fuel and consumables crew salary lubes and stores maintenance cost insurance and administration kay et al 2011 however in the case of decision making about survivability of the structure other costs such as the rescue cost and the loss of capital due to evacuation need to be considered in the present study the cost profile is carefully derived from the accidents and operational databases and consultations with the experts in the field kay et al 2011 stopford 2009 zei 2006 this resulted in assigning 1 k 10 k and 105 k for the cost of halting the operation requesting help and evacuating the facility respectively since this study is focused on human safety on board any fatalities result in financial loss of 109 k according to the total cost associated with value of life recommended by kip viscusi 2005 this value is applied to justify an investment of a protection measure to avert the loss of a life and the material loss up to that order to prevent a life lost therefore due to saving human life as a priority compared to other associated cost the value of human loss is considered to be a notably larger value this will demonstrate that in the final estimation of maximum expected utility a higher level of human safety will be achieved consequently the expected value of each decision alternative is computed based on the occurrence probability of extreme roll response and utility values assigned see eq 4 and fig 6 a comparison of the estimated expected values of all decision alternatives for different incident storm angle of attack are presented in fig 11 as illustrated in the graphs if the floating unit is in intact condition it can tolerate all ranges of the storm condition therefore there will be no concern about staying on board on the other hand in the case that the structure is flooded the safety of the crew is dependent on the wave angle of attack the results show if the storm attacks the structure with angles of 45 and 270 the captain should request help as the storm intensity is around a significant wave height of 5 15 m accordingly when the storm increases its level to hs 8 15 m the crew should evacuate the vessel urgently the situation is more flexible for the case that a flooded structure encounters the storm from the angle of 270 the crew can stay on board while they observe significant wave heights of 8 15 m nevertheless they should request help to survive the severe condition when the storm passes the wave height of hs 14 15 m the crew should evacuate the vessel to save their lives 6 conclusion a methodology is proposed here to assist in efficient and robust decisions to improve safety of the marine structures in evolving operational conditions the methodology is comprised of three main steps firstly the hydrodynamic analysis is conducted upon replicating storm through an intensifying wave train function this approach has the advantage of reducing computation cost of simulations second the appropriate probability distributions of each level of storm and its stochastic parameters are estimated and the performance of floating structure is assessed through a bayesian approach the developed bn is then extended into an id which assists in quick and robust decision making the application and effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through simulating an fsu in storm condition with different angles of attack the results of the analysis indicate that the most critical incident wave angles are 45 180 and 270 degrees in a non flooded condition the structure will be safe in the storm however it is necessary to halt the operation for a flooded fsu evacuation is the optimum decision alternative if the wave heights exceed hs 8 15 m for the incident wave angles of 45 and 180 and hs 14 15 m for 270 these observations highlight the proposed methodology be used as an effective tool for quick and robust decisions it incorporates the uncertainty associated with the dynamic behaviour of a floating structure and also the stochastic nature of operational and marine structure response variables this methodology could be integrated with the e navigational tool to ensure safety at sea 
23452,during the past decades the impact of shipping noise on marine ecology has always attracted more and more interest of the global researchers some empirical ship source level models have been proposed whether these models can be used to model the underwater radiated noise urn of merchant ships transiting near china remains to be examined the urn of 57 merchant ships was measured with an opportunistic bottom mounted acoustic observatory in the east china sea at least one day in each month from jan 2015 to nov 2016 the propagation losses pls of transiting ships were modeled using normal modes combining with the realistic geoacoustic parameters the corresponding uncertainties were also analyzed and the bottom type and the source depth were the major factors based on pl computations the spectral source levels ssls of 57 ships were obtained by comparing with the estimations using empirical models the discrepancies indicated that the median estimation errors using randi 3 model and ross s model were 0 7 1 db and 6 8 3 2 db respectively furthermore the trends with speed and length at different frequency ranges were also compared with ross s model these results might be helpful to develop a more precise model for the further research keywords merchant ship radiated noise the east china sea urn model source level 1 introduction it is well known that noise levels in the sea began to increase steadily with the onset of industrialization in the mid nineteenth century and this trend may be continued in recent times but lack of enough scientific evidence it is an important research task to evaluate the human and natural contributions to marine ambient noise and describe the long term trends in ambient noise levels especially from human activities nrc 2003 vessel noise from a range of different ship types substantially elevated ambient noise levels across the entire recording from 0 025 to 160 khz at ranges between 60 and 1000 m hermannsen et al 2014 ross analyzed the noise levels measured in the mid 20th century and suggested that the low frequency noise was increasing rapidly at an average rate of about 0 5 db per year ross 2005 he also postulated this trend would not be sustained and this rate was later proved to be 0 2 db yr chapman and price 2011 most recently andrew howe and mercer s measurement in the northeast pacific showed a level or slightly decreasing trend in low frequency noise andrew et al 2011 to make it clear whether the low frequency trends still exist in other regions miksis olds and nichols examined the rate and magnitude of change in low frequency sound 5 115 hz over the past decade in the south atlantic and equatorial pacific oceans the observations showed that sound levels over the past 5 6 yr in the above regions had decreased miksis olds and nichols 2016 by far the major component of the low frequency 500 hz ambient noise field is the noise generated by ship traffic breeding et al 1996 even very distant shipping noise can dominate and become the main background disturbance for the active sonar or passive sonar for the above reasons extensive concern has been made on the studying of ambient noise by so far many empirical models have been proposed the comparisons of different models urick 1983 ross 1976 wales and heitmeyer 2002 hamson and wagstaff 1983 breeding et al 1996 wittekind 2014 audoly and rizzuto 2015 are summarized in table 1 among the above models the two earliest models were proposed by ross 1976 and urick 1983 respectively in which the ssls of merchant ships or naval vessels can be expressed as a function of ship length draught and speed wales and heitmeyer 2002 proposed the mean spectrum model describing the source spectra between 30 hz and 1200 hz of 54 ships in the mediterranean sea and the eastern atlantic ocean the randi 2 model hamson and wagstaff 1983 and randi 3 model breeding et al 1996 are based on a reference ship ssl thus the individual ssl can be calculated as a function of its speed and length at present the randi 3 model has been used in modeling the ambient noise from traffic and providing the reference for assessing the impact on marine ecology from shipping noise gordon et al 2003 simard et al 2016 hom et al 2016 but it should be noted that the randi 3 model is only introduced in the nrl report and lack of peer reviews which needs to be further verified compared with the measured data different from the above models both the wittekind s model wittekind 2014 and the aquo project s model audoly and rizzuto 2015 audoly et al 2017 consider the radiated noise should be decomposed into three components in the aquo project s model the parameters can be obtained by the numerical process of minimizing target function which requires at least two different speeds in addition to the above models in recent years with expanded use of controllable pitch propeller cpp a new model 3p three parameter model was proposed by traverso et al 2015 2017 based on ross model and lurton model lurton 2010 to build urn models the reliable data must be obtained as input at first a series of radiated noise measurement standards have been proposed by some organizations such as asa ansi asa 2009 dnv 2010 ices 1995 and iso iso 17208 1 2016 of which the most widely used standard is the ansi asa s12 64 2009 in 1975 the u s navy initiated a new program for accurate narrow band measurements of merchant ship noise jointly sponsored by naval research laboratory nrl and naval ocean research and development activity in 1980 the radiated noise of m v harriette was measured by arveson and vendittis 2000 sponsored by nrl which was considered as one of the most accurate measurements until now the shipping noise of the main channels and waters around the world has been measured the measured sites are concentrated on the busy channels such as the mediterranean the north atlantic oceans near europe u s a canada the north indian oceans etc in the past ten years with the development of polar scientific research the measurement of shipping noise in the arctic ocean was also conducted roth et al 2013 scrimger and heitmeyer 1991 estimated the ssls of 50 ships approaching or departing from the mediterranean port of genoa italy in the frequency band 70 hz 700 hz by measuring the ssls of 593 container ships at the santa barbara channel mckenna et al 2013 studied the relationship of ssls with ship type operating parameters and oceanographic conditions in recent years sponsored by several large cooperation projects including silenv ship innovative solutions to reduce noise and vibrations silenv 2012 aquo achieve quieter oceans audoly and rizzuto 2015 sonic suppression of underwater noise induced by cavitation brooker and humphrey 2016 and mepc marine environment protection fund robinson et al 2011 the scientific research teams studied the radiated noise of the vessels at the north atlantic oceans brooker measured the radiated noise of a small research vessel with three hydrophone arrays deployed at shallow water sponsored by sonic project brooker and humphrey 2016 furthermore some recent works were published simard analyzed and modeled 255 sources levels of merchant ships from an acoustic observatory along st lawrence seaway simard et al 2016 jansen and de jong measured the shipping noise around the port of rotterdam and obtained the acoustic monopole source levels of 23 ships besides they compared the source levels of different ship types jansen and de jong 2017 to model the shipping noise the expensive measurements and reliable noise data are essential the measurement not only must be carried out adhering to the measurement standards as much as possible but also has the sufficient funding support for the long term plan however as suggested by arveson and vendittis 2000 at some level of detail more precise measurements and theoretical analysis will become too expensive and further progress in fleet noise predictions must revert to semi empirical approaches based on statistical data from a large number of ships which still appears to be the only low cost approach for predicting shipping noise levels so in the future from our viewpoints the opportunistic approach with low cost and acquiring more shipping noise data at each sea trial will become the efficient method other than cooperating approach measuring the noise of target vessel one by one in this paper the measurements were carried out by the opportunistic approach furthermore to study the impact on marine ecology from shipping noise long term measurement is essential however there are few literature to introduce the corresponding measurement at waters near china as concluded above there are many kinds of urn models published in literature however whether these models can be used to model the urn of ships transiting in waters near china or not almost no one gives corresponding scientific evidence what s more these regularities of ssls dependent on speed length remain to be examined especially at low frequencies in this study we measured the underwater noise radiated by merchant ships with an opportunistic bottom mounted acoustic observatory collecting data continuously at least one day in each month from jan 2015 to nov 2016 this paper is organized as follows in sec 2 we briefly introduce the measurement methodology present the typical measured background noise of each month and then introduce some following criteria respected in our measurements including the definition of data time window in sec 3 we present the processing methodology and propagation loss calculation with the normal modes and the finite element method fem and analyzed their uncertainties in sec 4 we introduce the methodology of randi 3 model and ross s model and compare ssls of 57 merchant ships with estimation results by these models the corresponding estimated errors and some features including the dependence of ssls on speed and length at frequencies above or below 100 hz are obtained finally a summary and a discussion of the results are presented in sec 5 2 description of measurement the measurements were undertaken by shanghai jiao tong university sjtu over a 2 year period 2015 2016 as recommended by the ansi s12 64 2009 standard ansi asa 2009 the three hydrophones should be placed at the depths corresponding to the target depression angles of 15 30 and 45 however for the east china sea most areas belong to shallow waters to fulfill the enough water depth the acoustic observatory must be chosen at more than 100 nmi apart from shanghai port which makes the cost too much to bear for the long term measurement as illustrated in fig 1 the shipping lane is the key leading to shanghai port as we all know shanghai port is one of the busiest ports in the world there are many kinds of ships transiting by this shipping lane every day so our acoustic observatory was chosen to be deployed in the busy shipping lane between two islands fig 1 the acoustic observatory is marked as star symbol in fig 1 as illustrated in fig 1 the acoustic observatory was fastened with a rope the other end of which was tied to a buoy set up with an automatic identification system ais system the interior of bottom mounted hydrophone is added with a processor and memory and the exterior of it is charged with a battery to fulfill the long time data collection task underwater as shown in fig 1 the response of the hydrophone is 176 db reμv pa and its sampling frequency is commonly set as 256 khz each data file records 1 min radiated noise data the photography of bottom mounted acoustic observatory deployed in situ is shown in fig 2 a and fig 2 b in addition an ais station was set up on the coasts of shengsi island to record the information on the operating conditions of each ship transit accurately shown in fig 2 c the ais data was subsequently used to define the closest point of approach cpa distance and the data analyzing window during data post processing our measurements were started in jan 2015 and continued until nov 2016 as illustrated in fig 3 the opportunistic transiting ships can be categorized as merchant ship tanker fishing vessel and others among these ship types the largest component is merchant ship including container ship and bulk cargo ship accounting for 64 44 the classes of measured ships and the corresponding ais codes can be consulted in gaggero et al 2015 in this paper analyzing the radiated noise of merchant ships is our primary task as illustrated in figs 4 and 5 the length and speed of merchant ships are mainly distributed from 60 m to 220 m and 6 kn to 14 kn respectively some photographs of merchant ships are shown in fig 6 characteristic descriptions of some transiting merchant ships are shown in table 2 during the measurements the signal to noise ratio snr depends on the background noise which is always present as recommended in iso and ansi standards the effect of background will be ignored if the difference between the radiated noise and the background noise level is greater than 10 db the data is considered unusable if the difference is less than 3 db and the correction will be made if the difference is between 3 db and 10 db in principle the measurement of background noise should be made at the beginning and at the end of each run as the background noise is not sufficiently stationary sometimes the background noise measured at the beginning or at the end of each run cannot represent the real level during the trial due to other passing vessels disturbance by analyzing the recorded data and combining with recorded ais we picked out the noise data segments with no present ships within a radius of 5 km as the representative background noise and the measured background noise in third band averaged spectrum levels of each month is shown in fig 7 the result was obtained by averaged over three data segments each with 5 min measured from 8 a m to 4 p m in each sea trial as illustrated in fig 7 the spectrum levels at 1 khz in winter are larger than that in summer as the wind generated noise in winter is higher than that in summer at this sea area as mentioned in simard et al 2016 the ssl should be estimated when the following criteria were respected a no other ship was present within a radius of 5 km while the focal ship was within the data processing window centered at cpa b the ship speed over ground sog was faster than 1 kn c the dcpa exceeded 100 m among these criteria the first criterion is made for the opportunistic acoustic observatory especially at busy traffic area to make the ssl of the focal ship estimated more accurately without noise contamination from other ships based on these criteria we picked the effective radiated noise data of 57 merchant ships from large amount of noise data generated by transiting ships fig 8 shows the transiting ship tracks near our acoustic observatory within 24 h we can see that the spatial positions of transiting vessels are always changing over the time during the trials and each longitude latitude coordinate point is drawn according to the recorded ais data the non alignments between the cpa time given by ais and the hydrophone clocks will result in errors however from the physical mechanism the cpa see fig 9 a must be present at the center of the bathtub pattern see fig 9 b due to lloyd s mirror effects or in the passing characteristic pattern in time domain see fig 9 c so we can determine the cpa present moment at data recording time according to the bathtub pattern after processing the data the first step is to determine the distance of cpa by finding the minimum among the distances between receiving point and each discrete position of transiting ship then the dwl can be obtained as follows 1 d w l 2 d c p a tan 30 m where d cpa is the horizontal distance between ship and hydrophone corresponding to cpa as the speed can be given by ais the data window period t can be evaluated as follows 2 t d w l v s where v is the speed of transiting ship m s here the second step is to determine the corresponding start moment t start and end moment t end from data recording time as follows 3 t s t a r t t c p a t 2 s t e n d t c p a t 2 s where t cpa is the moment corresponding to the cpa which has one to one relationship with the center of the bathtub pattern therefore according to the start moment and end moment we can define the data window period besides we can judge whether other ships are present during the measurement roughly from the striations of spectrogram 3 processing methodology and propagation loss model as illustrated in fig 10 in order to obtain the power spectral density and 1 3 octaves spectrum the recorded signal is processed as recommended in coward 2013 it should be noted that the spectrum is evaluated following the welch procedure a modified periodogram method widely used now the sls of the transiting ships are estimated from the received level rl at a distant range r which is compensated for the pl according to the equation as follows 4 s l f r l f r p l f r where f is the frequency hz and r is the slant range along the propagation path m there are two ways to compute the pl modeling activities and simple law the modeling activities require the input of environmental parameters including bathymetry of the test site source depth and sound speed profile the experimental area can be characterized as a flat bottom with 24 m depth roughly the sea floor is composed of a layer of clayey silt with 35 cm thickness and a half infinite layer of fine sand li 1990 as shown schematically in fig 11 the geoacoustic parameters jensen et al 2000 hamilton 1980 are described in table 3 and the ocean empirical sound speeds at this area are shown in table 4 chen 1992 here we also give a sound speed profile measured on jun 7 as illustrated in fig 11 b and the descriptions in chen 1992 the sound speed type of experimental area presents weak gradient variation along the depth for the sound speed profile we considered adopting the measured data in jun jul and aug first and empirical values afterwards among these parameters the closest distance d cpa part as shown in table 2 depends on ais data of each transiting ship the depth of equivalent point source d s is set as two thirds the draught of vessel audoly and rizzuto 2015 to illustrate the modeling process of pl here we consider a numerical example the selected transiting ship was xing dong 8 with mmsi 412701140 measured on jun 23 2015 the ship s draught and the closest distance are 5 9 m and 295 3 m respectively thus the equivalent source depth is 3 93 m approximately the environmental parameters are taken from tables 3 and 4 the receiving point is at the location with the range of 295 3 m and the depth of 23 8 m for ranges greater than several water depths the acoustic pressure field can be expressed as a finite sum of normal modes we have here suppressed the time dependence exp jωt the acoustic pressure at range r and depth z produced by a point source at depth z s can be expressed as jensen et al 2000 5 p r z j e j π 4 ρ z s 8 π r i 1 z m z s z m z e j k r m r k r m where the function z m z is an eigenfunction and k rm is an eigenvalue ρ is the density of sea water for ranges within several water depths the acoustic pressure field can be calculated with 2d axisymmetric fem to model the sound propagation in semi infinite medium the 2d axisymmetric fe model with perfect matched layer pml was built for calculating the pl of each ship here we give the comparison of pl computations by kraken c and comsol shown in fig 12 a the pl in water column is presented in function of the range 100 m 500 m and depth as shown in fig 12 b from fig 12 a we can see the pl computations with both methods are completely matched which suggests that both methods can be used to calculate the pl with elastic sea floor for ranges greater than several depths considering the numerical efficiency and low frequency cutoff phenomenon we choose to use normal modes above 100 hz and 2d axisymmetric fem below 100 hz cautiously the third octave sl can be calculated from the narrow band spectrum level with bandwidth 1 hz approximately as follows 6 s l 1 3oct f c 10 lg f min f max 10 sl f 0 10 df db re μ pa 2 m 2 the limit of integration is defined by lower frequency f min upper frequency f max and central frequency f c sl f 0 is the narrow band spectrum density from the third octave band levels it is possible to define a band averaged spectral level by dividing by the amplitude of the frequency band of each 1 3 octave band this quantity is defined by 7 s l f 10 lg 10 s l 1 3 oct f c 10 δ f c s l 1 3 oct f c 10 lg 0 23 f c db re μp a 2 m 2 hz using kraken c and comsol together with the ais data we obtained the pls of 57 ships as shown in fig 13 a it is worth noting that the calculated pl generally increases with the cpa distance at the same frequencies besides the calculated pls at low frequencies below about 100 hz are higher than that at frequencies above 100 hz the calculated pl tends to be a stable level with increasing frequency the main reason may be that the level in a wider frequency band are averaged at higher frequencies in 1 3 octave band and the pl at low frequencies shows more reflection characteristics from the sea surface and bottom fig 13 b shows that the pl computations below 80 hz are much closer to 20log r than the results above 80 hz if using spherical spreading law in 24 m shallow water huge errors will be brought especially at frequencies above 80 hz furthermore we analyzed the dependence of the calculated pl on cpa distance which was averaged from 50 hz to 1 khz in third octave as shown in fig 14 it is noted that the pl computations for the 57 transiting ships are obtained according to the realistic draught from the individual ais information and corresponding sound speed profile thus the pl comparison about cpa distance in fig 14 ignores the above two factors in fig 14 the pl has a strong correlation with the horizontal receiving distance at all frequencies the corresponding standard errors se and pearson s r are shown in table 5 the pearson s r is from 0 83 to 0 97 at frequencies from 50 hz to 1 khz and its absolute value increases with frequency which indicates that the pl has a stronger correlation with cpa distance at higher frequencies besides the band averaged pl from 50 hz to 1 khz has the strongest correlation with horizontal distance in table 5 we also list the formula at different frequencies and the nonzero intercept indicates that the pl computations are dependent on not only the horizontal distance but also other factors including the source depth sea depth geoacoustic parameters and sound speed profile the slope is from 14 4 to 19 9 with a band averaged value 16 7 there are several factors contributing to the uncertainties of the individual pl estimation first of all the bias of the closest distance estimated by ais data with a 10 m change in range could be an indispensable factor coward 2013 secondly the unavoidable estimation error of equivalent source depth could bring some uncertainties with a 1 m change coward 2013 additionally the bottom type 2 is utilized to compare with the bottom type 1 in this model due to the fact that one bottom type is not reasonable to be specific the parameters of bottom type 2 are the same as type 1 shown in table 3 except the density compressional wave speed and shear wave speed for the sediment which are set to 1 5 g cm3 1500 m s and 50 m s respectively for the subbottom the density and compressional wave speed are set to 1 9 g cm3 and 1650 m s respectively thirdly the ssp actually varies with time therefore the difference between assumed constant ssp and real ssp should be discussed on the influence of the individual pl estimation finally it is noted that the receiver depth has an uncertainty of about 1 m all the factors above are listed in table 6 the underlined values are higher than 4 db it is demonstrated that the bottom type is the largest factor influencing the pl among all uncertainties the uncertainties for the bottom type at frequencies below 315 hz are larger than that at frequencies above 315 hz on the whole for the source depth except 630 hz 6 1 db and 1 khz 4 3 db all uncertainties are within 2 5 db finally the remaining factors including the range with 10 m change constant ssp vs real ssp and the receiving depth with 1 m change have little influence on the pl at all frequencies within 2 0 db 4 statistical analyses and assessment 4 1 description of randi 3 model and ross s model in randi 3 model breeding et al 1996 the ship source levels are computed by defining an average ship as one with a speed of 12 kn and a length of 300 ft thus the ship source levels are computed as follows 8 l s f v l s l s o f 60 lg v 12 20 lg l s 300 d f d l 3 0 where v and l s are ship speed kn and length ft respectively l s o is the spectrum basis in db re 1μpa2m2 hz 1 m df and dl are correction values for the ship category 9 d f 8 1 0 00 f 28 40 22 3 9 77 lg f 28 4 f 191 6 0 f 191 6 d l l s 1 15 3643 and for f 500 h z 10 l s o f 10 lg 10 1 06 lg f 14 34 10 3 32 lg f 21 425 for f 500 h z 11 l s o f 173 2 18 0 lg f as indicated in eq 8 the ship sl can be divided into four components the average ship s source level components about speed or length and the remainder term among them the average ship s source level is the most important which not only gives the basic skeleton from ssls of measured merchant ships but also contains the dependent information about frequency it is conceivable that the average ship s source level will be different if the group constitutions including length speed and ship type are quite different if the number of samples is sufficiently large the average ship s source level tends to be stable ross s models are based on equations accounting for ship speed and displacement ross 1976 since the displacement obtained from ais information is sometimes not accurate enough here we listed the speed dependent model as follows 12 s l f 190 53 lg v 10 20 lg f f 100 hz 4 2 source level and statistical analyses here we adopt the representation of ssls in 1 3 octaves spectrum the main reasons for that choice are indicated in audoly and rizzuto 2015 a it includes both wide band and narrow band information b its measurement is relatively reliable c the level is independent from frequency band used for averaging provided bandwidth f is sufficiently large considering the cutoff phenomenon in 24 m depth water and guaranteeing enough snr for the measured data we choose the analyzing frequencies in third octave starting from 50 hz based on the pl computations see in sec 3 the ssls of 57 merchant ships were obtained and shown in fig 15 it is noted that the length and speed of ships are 72 m 200 m and 6 kn 13 8 kn respectively from the boxplot we can see the interquartile ranges are 6 68 at 250 hz to 12 86 at 63 hz with a mean value 9 24 from the median there are two remarkable characteristics 1 a prominent hump with the median 150 2 db is present at 63 hz 2 the ssls of 57 merchant ships at 500 hz 630 hz and 800 hz are lifted deviating from the whole decay slope about 6 db oct extensive experimental results see the m v overseas harriette measured results in arveson and vendittis 2000 the radiated noise of british cruiser cardiff and passenger ship astrid measured in wwii in ross 1976 have shown that the prominent hump between 40 and 100 hz is a typical feature in noise spectra more importantly the hump shifts to the lower frequencies with the speed increasing and the corresponding levels are also lifted ross 1976 the second characteristic can be more intuitively seen from spectrogram fig 16 shows the presence of tones at 563 hz and 631 hz a at 681 hz and 800 hz b resulted in higher noise levels this phenomenon was also observed by mckenna et al 2013 as pointed out by them the cause of these tones is unknown but may relate to propeller damage which increase radiated noise and potentially decrease efficiency of the propulsion system furthermore due to the propeller cavitation of some ships the ssls are lifted at frequencies above 300 hz approximately audoly and rizzuto 2015 the estimation results of 57 merchant ships using randi 3 and ross s model and their corresponding estimation errors are shown in fig 17 randi 3 model and fig 18 ross s model as illustrated in figs 17 and 18 the ssl estimations with randi 3 are much closer to the measured results than ross s model in general the main reason may be that randi 3 model is developed based on newer samples and drawn lessons from the ross s model which makes the randi 3 model more suitable to model the ssls of modern merchant ships although the dependences on ship speed and length might be different with frequency the ross s model indicated that these dependences can be obtained by analyzing the broadband sl above 100 hz ross 1976 we adopted this methodology and divided the frequency range into two segment 50 hz 100 hz and 100 hz 1 khz the ssls within the two ranges were averaged on frequency furthermore in order to find the dependences on speed or length the number of independent variables must be restrict to one to be specific we chose 24 ssls of the measured ships with length from 94 m to 100 m disregarding the effect from the difference of length and divided them into 6 groups according to the speed sequence from 6 5 kn to 12 3 kn the ssls in each group were power averaged the purpose of this disposal is to eliminate the measuring errors of speed and smooth the difference of ssl from the frequency because the speed shown in ais is the speed over ground sog but the ssl of a ship is more likely correlated with speed through the water the effect of surface currents was estimated to be 0 4 0 5kn against the ship sailing direction simard et al 2016 the speed dependence of 6 groups of ships within two frequency ranges is shown in fig 19 a the average levels for 6 groups of ships vary by 3 5 db from the trend curve in the same way to obtain the length dependence we must guarantee the speed is an invariant from figs 4 and 5 we can see the speed distribution is not as intensive as length distribution at certain interval although the number of ships with speed between 9 kn and 10 kn reaches to 15 the interval of corresponding lengths is relative narrow which will make huge errors in fitting curve when the 15 ships results are chosen thus in order to eliminate the measuring errors of speed and smooth the difference of ssl from the frequency we divided the 57 ssls of merchant ships into 7 groups according to the length sequence from 72 m to 200 m the reason of this disposal is that length has no correlation with speed and the speed distribution is relative scattered the length dependence of 7 groups of ships within two frequency ranges is shown in fig 19 b the average levels for 7 groups of ships vary by 4 5 db from the trend curve the mean decaying trend of ssl towards higher frequencies dependent on speed and length from fitting curves are presented in table 7 as indicated in table 7 the decay slope dependent on speed at 50 hz 100 hz is 37 8 and lower than the value 49 2 at 100 hz 1 khz the decay slope dependent on speed at 100 hz 1 khz is very close to the value 50 of ross model ross 1976 in one expression the other expression is 60 furthermore the decay slopes dependent on length within both frequency ranges are about 18 which are also close to the value 20 of ross s model table 7 also gives the corresponding error analysis 5 summary and discussion the measurement of radiated noise generated by merchant ships is a long term strenuous work considering high cost of ship rent the acoustic observatory was adopted in the opportunistic bottom mounted form and deployed at the busy shipping lane to shanghai port the measurement was started from jan 2015 and ended in nov 2016 an ensemble of 57 merchant ships ssls was measured in the east china sea over a 2 year period the measurements were carried out in shallow water 24 m the pl of each passing ship was modeled using normal mode and finite element models averaged in third octave bands the pl increases with about 17 3 db times the logarithm of the ratio of the horizontal receiving distance to a reference distance of 1 m among all the uncertainties the bottom type is the largest factor influencing the pl which is followed by the source depth other factors including the range with 10 m change constant ssp vs real ssp and receiving depth with 1 m change have little influence on the pl within 2 0 db based on pl computations we obtained the ssls of 57 ships by comparing the extensive measured results with the estimated results of empirical models we found some features as below 1 a prominent hump with the median ssl of 150 2 db is presented at 63 hz 2 there are some tones present in the spectrogram which makes the ssls of 57 merchant ships at frequencies of 500 hz 630 hz and 800 hz be lifted deviating from the mean decaying trend of ssl towards higher frequencies 3 the ssl estimations using randi 3 model are much closer to the measured results than ross s model in general and the median estimation errors using randi 3 model and ross s model are 0 7 1 db and 6 8 3 2 db respectively 4 the observed dependences of the ssl on ship speed and length are close to the trends suggested in ross s model in the 100 hz to 1 khz frequency band in the 50 hz 100 hz band the sll appear to increase with 38 2 times the logarithm of the ship speed v which is lower that the 50lgv trend in ross s model acknowledgements the efforts summarized here

23452,during the past decades the impact of shipping noise on marine ecology has always attracted more and more interest of the global researchers some empirical ship source level models have been proposed whether these models can be used to model the underwater radiated noise urn of merchant ships transiting near china remains to be examined the urn of 57 merchant ships was measured with an opportunistic bottom mounted acoustic observatory in the east china sea at least one day in each month from jan 2015 to nov 2016 the propagation losses pls of transiting ships were modeled using normal modes combining with the realistic geoacoustic parameters the corresponding uncertainties were also analyzed and the bottom type and the source depth were the major factors based on pl computations the spectral source levels ssls of 57 ships were obtained by comparing with the estimations using empirical models the discrepancies indicated that the median estimation errors using randi 3 model and ross s model were 0 7 1 db and 6 8 3 2 db respectively furthermore the trends with speed and length at different frequency ranges were also compared with ross s model these results might be helpful to develop a more precise model for the further research keywords merchant ship radiated noise the east china sea urn model source level 1 introduction it is well known that noise levels in the sea began to increase steadily with the onset of industrialization in the mid nineteenth century and this trend may be continued in recent times but lack of enough scientific evidence it is an important research task to evaluate the human and natural contributions to marine ambient noise and describe the long term trends in ambient noise levels especially from human activities nrc 2003 vessel noise from a range of different ship types substantially elevated ambient noise levels across the entire recording from 0 025 to 160 khz at ranges between 60 and 1000 m hermannsen et al 2014 ross analyzed the noise levels measured in the mid 20th century and suggested that the low frequency noise was increasing rapidly at an average rate of about 0 5 db per year ross 2005 he also postulated this trend would not be sustained and this rate was later proved to be 0 2 db yr chapman and price 2011 most recently andrew howe and mercer s measurement in the northeast pacific showed a level or slightly decreasing trend in low frequency noise andrew et al 2011 to make it clear whether the low frequency trends still exist in other regions miksis olds and nichols examined the rate and magnitude of change in low frequency sound 5 115 hz over the past decade in the south atlantic and equatorial pacific oceans the observations showed that sound levels over the past 5 6 yr in the above regions had decreased miksis olds and nichols 2016 by far the major component of the low frequency 500 hz ambient noise field is the noise generated by ship traffic breeding et al 1996 even very distant shipping noise can dominate and become the main background disturbance for the active sonar or passive sonar for the above reasons extensive concern has been made on the studying of ambient noise by so far many empirical models have been proposed the comparisons of different models urick 1983 ross 1976 wales and heitmeyer 2002 hamson and wagstaff 1983 breeding et al 1996 wittekind 2014 audoly and rizzuto 2015 are summarized in table 1 among the above models the two earliest models were proposed by ross 1976 and urick 1983 respectively in which the ssls of merchant ships or naval vessels can be expressed as a function of ship length draught and speed wales and heitmeyer 2002 proposed the mean spectrum model describing the source spectra between 30 hz and 1200 hz of 54 ships in the mediterranean sea and the eastern atlantic ocean the randi 2 model hamson and wagstaff 1983 and randi 3 model breeding et al 1996 are based on a reference ship ssl thus the individual ssl can be calculated as a function of its speed and length at present the randi 3 model has been used in modeling the ambient noise from traffic and providing the reference for assessing the impact on marine ecology from shipping noise gordon et al 2003 simard et al 2016 hom et al 2016 but it should be noted that the randi 3 model is only introduced in the nrl report and lack of peer reviews which needs to be further verified compared with the measured data different from the above models both the wittekind s model wittekind 2014 and the aquo project s model audoly and rizzuto 2015 audoly et al 2017 consider the radiated noise should be decomposed into three components in the aquo project s model the parameters can be obtained by the numerical process of minimizing target function which requires at least two different speeds in addition to the above models in recent years with expanded use of controllable pitch propeller cpp a new model 3p three parameter model was proposed by traverso et al 2015 2017 based on ross model and lurton model lurton 2010 to build urn models the reliable data must be obtained as input at first a series of radiated noise measurement standards have been proposed by some organizations such as asa ansi asa 2009 dnv 2010 ices 1995 and iso iso 17208 1 2016 of which the most widely used standard is the ansi asa s12 64 2009 in 1975 the u s navy initiated a new program for accurate narrow band measurements of merchant ship noise jointly sponsored by naval research laboratory nrl and naval ocean research and development activity in 1980 the radiated noise of m v harriette was measured by arveson and vendittis 2000 sponsored by nrl which was considered as one of the most accurate measurements until now the shipping noise of the main channels and waters around the world has been measured the measured sites are concentrated on the busy channels such as the mediterranean the north atlantic oceans near europe u s a canada the north indian oceans etc in the past ten years with the development of polar scientific research the measurement of shipping noise in the arctic ocean was also conducted roth et al 2013 scrimger and heitmeyer 1991 estimated the ssls of 50 ships approaching or departing from the mediterranean port of genoa italy in the frequency band 70 hz 700 hz by measuring the ssls of 593 container ships at the santa barbara channel mckenna et al 2013 studied the relationship of ssls with ship type operating parameters and oceanographic conditions in recent years sponsored by several large cooperation projects including silenv ship innovative solutions to reduce noise and vibrations silenv 2012 aquo achieve quieter oceans audoly and rizzuto 2015 sonic suppression of underwater noise induced by cavitation brooker and humphrey 2016 and mepc marine environment protection fund robinson et al 2011 the scientific research teams studied the radiated noise of the vessels at the north atlantic oceans brooker measured the radiated noise of a small research vessel with three hydrophone arrays deployed at shallow water sponsored by sonic project brooker and humphrey 2016 furthermore some recent works were published simard analyzed and modeled 255 sources levels of merchant ships from an acoustic observatory along st lawrence seaway simard et al 2016 jansen and de jong measured the shipping noise around the port of rotterdam and obtained the acoustic monopole source levels of 23 ships besides they compared the source levels of different ship types jansen and de jong 2017 to model the shipping noise the expensive measurements and reliable noise data are essential the measurement not only must be carried out adhering to the measurement standards as much as possible but also has the sufficient funding support for the long term plan however as suggested by arveson and vendittis 2000 at some level of detail more precise measurements and theoretical analysis will become too expensive and further progress in fleet noise predictions must revert to semi empirical approaches based on statistical data from a large number of ships which still appears to be the only low cost approach for predicting shipping noise levels so in the future from our viewpoints the opportunistic approach with low cost and acquiring more shipping noise data at each sea trial will become the efficient method other than cooperating approach measuring the noise of target vessel one by one in this paper the measurements were carried out by the opportunistic approach furthermore to study the impact on marine ecology from shipping noise long term measurement is essential however there are few literature to introduce the corresponding measurement at waters near china as concluded above there are many kinds of urn models published in literature however whether these models can be used to model the urn of ships transiting in waters near china or not almost no one gives corresponding scientific evidence what s more these regularities of ssls dependent on speed length remain to be examined especially at low frequencies in this study we measured the underwater noise radiated by merchant ships with an opportunistic bottom mounted acoustic observatory collecting data continuously at least one day in each month from jan 2015 to nov 2016 this paper is organized as follows in sec 2 we briefly introduce the measurement methodology present the typical measured background noise of each month and then introduce some following criteria respected in our measurements including the definition of data time window in sec 3 we present the processing methodology and propagation loss calculation with the normal modes and the finite element method fem and analyzed their uncertainties in sec 4 we introduce the methodology of randi 3 model and ross s model and compare ssls of 57 merchant ships with estimation results by these models the corresponding estimated errors and some features including the dependence of ssls on speed and length at frequencies above or below 100 hz are obtained finally a summary and a discussion of the results are presented in sec 5 2 description of measurement the measurements were undertaken by shanghai jiao tong university sjtu over a 2 year period 2015 2016 as recommended by the ansi s12 64 2009 standard ansi asa 2009 the three hydrophones should be placed at the depths corresponding to the target depression angles of 15 30 and 45 however for the east china sea most areas belong to shallow waters to fulfill the enough water depth the acoustic observatory must be chosen at more than 100 nmi apart from shanghai port which makes the cost too much to bear for the long term measurement as illustrated in fig 1 the shipping lane is the key leading to shanghai port as we all know shanghai port is one of the busiest ports in the world there are many kinds of ships transiting by this shipping lane every day so our acoustic observatory was chosen to be deployed in the busy shipping lane between two islands fig 1 the acoustic observatory is marked as star symbol in fig 1 as illustrated in fig 1 the acoustic observatory was fastened with a rope the other end of which was tied to a buoy set up with an automatic identification system ais system the interior of bottom mounted hydrophone is added with a processor and memory and the exterior of it is charged with a battery to fulfill the long time data collection task underwater as shown in fig 1 the response of the hydrophone is 176 db reμv pa and its sampling frequency is commonly set as 256 khz each data file records 1 min radiated noise data the photography of bottom mounted acoustic observatory deployed in situ is shown in fig 2 a and fig 2 b in addition an ais station was set up on the coasts of shengsi island to record the information on the operating conditions of each ship transit accurately shown in fig 2 c the ais data was subsequently used to define the closest point of approach cpa distance and the data analyzing window during data post processing our measurements were started in jan 2015 and continued until nov 2016 as illustrated in fig 3 the opportunistic transiting ships can be categorized as merchant ship tanker fishing vessel and others among these ship types the largest component is merchant ship including container ship and bulk cargo ship accounting for 64 44 the classes of measured ships and the corresponding ais codes can be consulted in gaggero et al 2015 in this paper analyzing the radiated noise of merchant ships is our primary task as illustrated in figs 4 and 5 the length and speed of merchant ships are mainly distributed from 60 m to 220 m and 6 kn to 14 kn respectively some photographs of merchant ships are shown in fig 6 characteristic descriptions of some transiting merchant ships are shown in table 2 during the measurements the signal to noise ratio snr depends on the background noise which is always present as recommended in iso and ansi standards the effect of background will be ignored if the difference between the radiated noise and the background noise level is greater than 10 db the data is considered unusable if the difference is less than 3 db and the correction will be made if the difference is between 3 db and 10 db in principle the measurement of background noise should be made at the beginning and at the end of each run as the background noise is not sufficiently stationary sometimes the background noise measured at the beginning or at the end of each run cannot represent the real level during the trial due to other passing vessels disturbance by analyzing the recorded data and combining with recorded ais we picked out the noise data segments with no present ships within a radius of 5 km as the representative background noise and the measured background noise in third band averaged spectrum levels of each month is shown in fig 7 the result was obtained by averaged over three data segments each with 5 min measured from 8 a m to 4 p m in each sea trial as illustrated in fig 7 the spectrum levels at 1 khz in winter are larger than that in summer as the wind generated noise in winter is higher than that in summer at this sea area as mentioned in simard et al 2016 the ssl should be estimated when the following criteria were respected a no other ship was present within a radius of 5 km while the focal ship was within the data processing window centered at cpa b the ship speed over ground sog was faster than 1 kn c the dcpa exceeded 100 m among these criteria the first criterion is made for the opportunistic acoustic observatory especially at busy traffic area to make the ssl of the focal ship estimated more accurately without noise contamination from other ships based on these criteria we picked the effective radiated noise data of 57 merchant ships from large amount of noise data generated by transiting ships fig 8 shows the transiting ship tracks near our acoustic observatory within 24 h we can see that the spatial positions of transiting vessels are always changing over the time during the trials and each longitude latitude coordinate point is drawn according to the recorded ais data the non alignments between the cpa time given by ais and the hydrophone clocks will result in errors however from the physical mechanism the cpa see fig 9 a must be present at the center of the bathtub pattern see fig 9 b due to lloyd s mirror effects or in the passing characteristic pattern in time domain see fig 9 c so we can determine the cpa present moment at data recording time according to the bathtub pattern after processing the data the first step is to determine the distance of cpa by finding the minimum among the distances between receiving point and each discrete position of transiting ship then the dwl can be obtained as follows 1 d w l 2 d c p a tan 30 m where d cpa is the horizontal distance between ship and hydrophone corresponding to cpa as the speed can be given by ais the data window period t can be evaluated as follows 2 t d w l v s where v is the speed of transiting ship m s here the second step is to determine the corresponding start moment t start and end moment t end from data recording time as follows 3 t s t a r t t c p a t 2 s t e n d t c p a t 2 s where t cpa is the moment corresponding to the cpa which has one to one relationship with the center of the bathtub pattern therefore according to the start moment and end moment we can define the data window period besides we can judge whether other ships are present during the measurement roughly from the striations of spectrogram 3 processing methodology and propagation loss model as illustrated in fig 10 in order to obtain the power spectral density and 1 3 octaves spectrum the recorded signal is processed as recommended in coward 2013 it should be noted that the spectrum is evaluated following the welch procedure a modified periodogram method widely used now the sls of the transiting ships are estimated from the received level rl at a distant range r which is compensated for the pl according to the equation as follows 4 s l f r l f r p l f r where f is the frequency hz and r is the slant range along the propagation path m there are two ways to compute the pl modeling activities and simple law the modeling activities require the input of environmental parameters including bathymetry of the test site source depth and sound speed profile the experimental area can be characterized as a flat bottom with 24 m depth roughly the sea floor is composed of a layer of clayey silt with 35 cm thickness and a half infinite layer of fine sand li 1990 as shown schematically in fig 11 the geoacoustic parameters jensen et al 2000 hamilton 1980 are described in table 3 and the ocean empirical sound speeds at this area are shown in table 4 chen 1992 here we also give a sound speed profile measured on jun 7 as illustrated in fig 11 b and the descriptions in chen 1992 the sound speed type of experimental area presents weak gradient variation along the depth for the sound speed profile we considered adopting the measured data in jun jul and aug first and empirical values afterwards among these parameters the closest distance d cpa part as shown in table 2 depends on ais data of each transiting ship the depth of equivalent point source d s is set as two thirds the draught of vessel audoly and rizzuto 2015 to illustrate the modeling process of pl here we consider a numerical example the selected transiting ship was xing dong 8 with mmsi 412701140 measured on jun 23 2015 the ship s draught and the closest distance are 5 9 m and 295 3 m respectively thus the equivalent source depth is 3 93 m approximately the environmental parameters are taken from tables 3 and 4 the receiving point is at the location with the range of 295 3 m and the depth of 23 8 m for ranges greater than several water depths the acoustic pressure field can be expressed as a finite sum of normal modes we have here suppressed the time dependence exp jωt the acoustic pressure at range r and depth z produced by a point source at depth z s can be expressed as jensen et al 2000 5 p r z j e j π 4 ρ z s 8 π r i 1 z m z s z m z e j k r m r k r m where the function z m z is an eigenfunction and k rm is an eigenvalue ρ is the density of sea water for ranges within several water depths the acoustic pressure field can be calculated with 2d axisymmetric fem to model the sound propagation in semi infinite medium the 2d axisymmetric fe model with perfect matched layer pml was built for calculating the pl of each ship here we give the comparison of pl computations by kraken c and comsol shown in fig 12 a the pl in water column is presented in function of the range 100 m 500 m and depth as shown in fig 12 b from fig 12 a we can see the pl computations with both methods are completely matched which suggests that both methods can be used to calculate the pl with elastic sea floor for ranges greater than several depths considering the numerical efficiency and low frequency cutoff phenomenon we choose to use normal modes above 100 hz and 2d axisymmetric fem below 100 hz cautiously the third octave sl can be calculated from the narrow band spectrum level with bandwidth 1 hz approximately as follows 6 s l 1 3oct f c 10 lg f min f max 10 sl f 0 10 df db re μ pa 2 m 2 the limit of integration is defined by lower frequency f min upper frequency f max and central frequency f c sl f 0 is the narrow band spectrum density from the third octave band levels it is possible to define a band averaged spectral level by dividing by the amplitude of the frequency band of each 1 3 octave band this quantity is defined by 7 s l f 10 lg 10 s l 1 3 oct f c 10 δ f c s l 1 3 oct f c 10 lg 0 23 f c db re μp a 2 m 2 hz using kraken c and comsol together with the ais data we obtained the pls of 57 ships as shown in fig 13 a it is worth noting that the calculated pl generally increases with the cpa distance at the same frequencies besides the calculated pls at low frequencies below about 100 hz are higher than that at frequencies above 100 hz the calculated pl tends to be a stable level with increasing frequency the main reason may be that the level in a wider frequency band are averaged at higher frequencies in 1 3 octave band and the pl at low frequencies shows more reflection characteristics from the sea surface and bottom fig 13 b shows that the pl computations below 80 hz are much closer to 20log r than the results above 80 hz if using spherical spreading law in 24 m shallow water huge errors will be brought especially at frequencies above 80 hz furthermore we analyzed the dependence of the calculated pl on cpa distance which was averaged from 50 hz to 1 khz in third octave as shown in fig 14 it is noted that the pl computations for the 57 transiting ships are obtained according to the realistic draught from the individual ais information and corresponding sound speed profile thus the pl comparison about cpa distance in fig 14 ignores the above two factors in fig 14 the pl has a strong correlation with the horizontal receiving distance at all frequencies the corresponding standard errors se and pearson s r are shown in table 5 the pearson s r is from 0 83 to 0 97 at frequencies from 50 hz to 1 khz and its absolute value increases with frequency which indicates that the pl has a stronger correlation with cpa distance at higher frequencies besides the band averaged pl from 50 hz to 1 khz has the strongest correlation with horizontal distance in table 5 we also list the formula at different frequencies and the nonzero intercept indicates that the pl computations are dependent on not only the horizontal distance but also other factors including the source depth sea depth geoacoustic parameters and sound speed profile the slope is from 14 4 to 19 9 with a band averaged value 16 7 there are several factors contributing to the uncertainties of the individual pl estimation first of all the bias of the closest distance estimated by ais data with a 10 m change in range could be an indispensable factor coward 2013 secondly the unavoidable estimation error of equivalent source depth could bring some uncertainties with a 1 m change coward 2013 additionally the bottom type 2 is utilized to compare with the bottom type 1 in this model due to the fact that one bottom type is not reasonable to be specific the parameters of bottom type 2 are the same as type 1 shown in table 3 except the density compressional wave speed and shear wave speed for the sediment which are set to 1 5 g cm3 1500 m s and 50 m s respectively for the subbottom the density and compressional wave speed are set to 1 9 g cm3 and 1650 m s respectively thirdly the ssp actually varies with time therefore the difference between assumed constant ssp and real ssp should be discussed on the influence of the individual pl estimation finally it is noted that the receiver depth has an uncertainty of about 1 m all the factors above are listed in table 6 the underlined values are higher than 4 db it is demonstrated that the bottom type is the largest factor influencing the pl among all uncertainties the uncertainties for the bottom type at frequencies below 315 hz are larger than that at frequencies above 315 hz on the whole for the source depth except 630 hz 6 1 db and 1 khz 4 3 db all uncertainties are within 2 5 db finally the remaining factors including the range with 10 m change constant ssp vs real ssp and the receiving depth with 1 m change have little influence on the pl at all frequencies within 2 0 db 4 statistical analyses and assessment 4 1 description of randi 3 model and ross s model in randi 3 model breeding et al 1996 the ship source levels are computed by defining an average ship as one with a speed of 12 kn and a length of 300 ft thus the ship source levels are computed as follows 8 l s f v l s l s o f 60 lg v 12 20 lg l s 300 d f d l 3 0 where v and l s are ship speed kn and length ft respectively l s o is the spectrum basis in db re 1μpa2m2 hz 1 m df and dl are correction values for the ship category 9 d f 8 1 0 00 f 28 40 22 3 9 77 lg f 28 4 f 191 6 0 f 191 6 d l l s 1 15 3643 and for f 500 h z 10 l s o f 10 lg 10 1 06 lg f 14 34 10 3 32 lg f 21 425 for f 500 h z 11 l s o f 173 2 18 0 lg f as indicated in eq 8 the ship sl can be divided into four components the average ship s source level components about speed or length and the remainder term among them the average ship s source level is the most important which not only gives the basic skeleton from ssls of measured merchant ships but also contains the dependent information about frequency it is conceivable that the average ship s source level will be different if the group constitutions including length speed and ship type are quite different if the number of samples is sufficiently large the average ship s source level tends to be stable ross s models are based on equations accounting for ship speed and displacement ross 1976 since the displacement obtained from ais information is sometimes not accurate enough here we listed the speed dependent model as follows 12 s l f 190 53 lg v 10 20 lg f f 100 hz 4 2 source level and statistical analyses here we adopt the representation of ssls in 1 3 octaves spectrum the main reasons for that choice are indicated in audoly and rizzuto 2015 a it includes both wide band and narrow band information b its measurement is relatively reliable c the level is independent from frequency band used for averaging provided bandwidth f is sufficiently large considering the cutoff phenomenon in 24 m depth water and guaranteeing enough snr for the measured data we choose the analyzing frequencies in third octave starting from 50 hz based on the pl computations see in sec 3 the ssls of 57 merchant ships were obtained and shown in fig 15 it is noted that the length and speed of ships are 72 m 200 m and 6 kn 13 8 kn respectively from the boxplot we can see the interquartile ranges are 6 68 at 250 hz to 12 86 at 63 hz with a mean value 9 24 from the median there are two remarkable characteristics 1 a prominent hump with the median 150 2 db is present at 63 hz 2 the ssls of 57 merchant ships at 500 hz 630 hz and 800 hz are lifted deviating from the whole decay slope about 6 db oct extensive experimental results see the m v overseas harriette measured results in arveson and vendittis 2000 the radiated noise of british cruiser cardiff and passenger ship astrid measured in wwii in ross 1976 have shown that the prominent hump between 40 and 100 hz is a typical feature in noise spectra more importantly the hump shifts to the lower frequencies with the speed increasing and the corresponding levels are also lifted ross 1976 the second characteristic can be more intuitively seen from spectrogram fig 16 shows the presence of tones at 563 hz and 631 hz a at 681 hz and 800 hz b resulted in higher noise levels this phenomenon was also observed by mckenna et al 2013 as pointed out by them the cause of these tones is unknown but may relate to propeller damage which increase radiated noise and potentially decrease efficiency of the propulsion system furthermore due to the propeller cavitation of some ships the ssls are lifted at frequencies above 300 hz approximately audoly and rizzuto 2015 the estimation results of 57 merchant ships using randi 3 and ross s model and their corresponding estimation errors are shown in fig 17 randi 3 model and fig 18 ross s model as illustrated in figs 17 and 18 the ssl estimations with randi 3 are much closer to the measured results than ross s model in general the main reason may be that randi 3 model is developed based on newer samples and drawn lessons from the ross s model which makes the randi 3 model more suitable to model the ssls of modern merchant ships although the dependences on ship speed and length might be different with frequency the ross s model indicated that these dependences can be obtained by analyzing the broadband sl above 100 hz ross 1976 we adopted this methodology and divided the frequency range into two segment 50 hz 100 hz and 100 hz 1 khz the ssls within the two ranges were averaged on frequency furthermore in order to find the dependences on speed or length the number of independent variables must be restrict to one to be specific we chose 24 ssls of the measured ships with length from 94 m to 100 m disregarding the effect from the difference of length and divided them into 6 groups according to the speed sequence from 6 5 kn to 12 3 kn the ssls in each group were power averaged the purpose of this disposal is to eliminate the measuring errors of speed and smooth the difference of ssl from the frequency because the speed shown in ais is the speed over ground sog but the ssl of a ship is more likely correlated with speed through the water the effect of surface currents was estimated to be 0 4 0 5kn against the ship sailing direction simard et al 2016 the speed dependence of 6 groups of ships within two frequency ranges is shown in fig 19 a the average levels for 6 groups of ships vary by 3 5 db from the trend curve in the same way to obtain the length dependence we must guarantee the speed is an invariant from figs 4 and 5 we can see the speed distribution is not as intensive as length distribution at certain interval although the number of ships with speed between 9 kn and 10 kn reaches to 15 the interval of corresponding lengths is relative narrow which will make huge errors in fitting curve when the 15 ships results are chosen thus in order to eliminate the measuring errors of speed and smooth the difference of ssl from the frequency we divided the 57 ssls of merchant ships into 7 groups according to the length sequence from 72 m to 200 m the reason of this disposal is that length has no correlation with speed and the speed distribution is relative scattered the length dependence of 7 groups of ships within two frequency ranges is shown in fig 19 b the average levels for 7 groups of ships vary by 4 5 db from the trend curve the mean decaying trend of ssl towards higher frequencies dependent on speed and length from fitting curves are presented in table 7 as indicated in table 7 the decay slope dependent on speed at 50 hz 100 hz is 37 8 and lower than the value 49 2 at 100 hz 1 khz the decay slope dependent on speed at 100 hz 1 khz is very close to the value 50 of ross model ross 1976 in one expression the other expression is 60 furthermore the decay slopes dependent on length within both frequency ranges are about 18 which are also close to the value 20 of ross s model table 7 also gives the corresponding error analysis 5 summary and discussion the measurement of radiated noise generated by merchant ships is a long term strenuous work considering high cost of ship rent the acoustic observatory was adopted in the opportunistic bottom mounted form and deployed at the busy shipping lane to shanghai port the measurement was started from jan 2015 and ended in nov 2016 an ensemble of 57 merchant ships ssls was measured in the east china sea over a 2 year period the measurements were carried out in shallow water 24 m the pl of each passing ship was modeled using normal mode and finite element models averaged in third octave bands the pl increases with about 17 3 db times the logarithm of the ratio of the horizontal receiving distance to a reference distance of 1 m among all the uncertainties the bottom type is the largest factor influencing the pl which is followed by the source depth other factors including the range with 10 m change constant ssp vs real ssp and receiving depth with 1 m change have little influence on the pl within 2 0 db based on pl computations we obtained the ssls of 57 ships by comparing the extensive measured results with the estimated results of empirical models we found some features as below 1 a prominent hump with the median ssl of 150 2 db is presented at 63 hz 2 there are some tones present in the spectrogram which makes the ssls of 57 merchant ships at frequencies of 500 hz 630 hz and 800 hz be lifted deviating from the mean decaying trend of ssl towards higher frequencies 3 the ssl estimations using randi 3 model are much closer to the measured results than ross s model in general and the median estimation errors using randi 3 model and ross s model are 0 7 1 db and 6 8 3 2 db respectively 4 the observed dependences of the ssl on ship speed and length are close to the trends suggested in ross s model in the 100 hz to 1 khz frequency band in the 50 hz 100 hz band the sll appear to increase with 38 2 times the logarithm of the ship speed v which is lower that the 50lgv trend in ross s model acknowledgements the efforts summarized here

23453,numerical investigation of vortex shedding control and its suppression due to flow past a circular cylinder has been carried out starting from the reynolds number 20 and upto the appearance of first instability in the wake a technique local waviness is used in the confining walls for the effective control of shedding the local waviness with crest near the cylinder wake eliminates vortex shedding with reduced drag deepakkumar et al 2017 effect of amplitude of local waviness on vortex shedding characteristics are systematically carried out and presented in this article it is found that local waviness with amplitude a 0 15d is an optimum value for effective vortex shedding suppression with reduced drag on the cylinder at re 200 as the amplitude of waviness increases the wake size is reduced significantly as compared with plain wall confined cylinder the presence of crest closer to the cylinder in the downstream generates a favorable pressure gradient and prevents flow separation at reynolds number 20 the pressure drag is controlled significantly by the trough region in the waviness whereas the crest region affects both pressure and frictional drag also the appearance of first instability in the flow is identified for different amplitude of waviness keywords vortex shedding suppression passive control local waviness in the confining walls amplitude effect drag reduction 1 introduction vortex shedding due to cross flow past a circular cylinder is a common phenomenon in many engineering applications flow over civil structure submarines offshore structures pipelines in the sea bed bridge piers heat exchanger tubes are such examples the rigidity of the structure on such situation depends on the flow reynolds number especially at higher reynolds number it may fail due to flow induced vibration collapse of tacoma narrow bridge 1940 is a well known example there are some remedial techniques to completely eliminate the formation of vortex or to minimize the frequency and suppression of vortex shedding it is well known that the active and passive controls are two commonly used techniques where the passive technique of vortex shedding control requires no external power generally when the cylinder is confined by a rigid wall the shedding can be suppressed with some penalty in increase of drag on the cylinder strykowski and sreenivasan 1990 mittal and raghuvanshi 2001 and dipankar et al 2006 have used a secondary small control cylinder in the downstream to suppress vortex shedding formation from primary main cylinder they have identified that the suppression is achieved by the control cylinder which diverts a small amount of fluid into the wake of main cylinder on the other hand shair et al 1963 chen et al 1995 sahin et al 2004 shaligram et al 2006 chen et al 2013 and singha and sinhamahapatra 2010 have used rigid plain wall confinement and effectively controlled the shedding however reported increased drag on the cylinder further sahin et al 2004 have studied the effect of β on flow past circular cylinder and observed that for the values of β 0 5 the vortex shedding characteristics were alike to that of the unbounded domain β 0 hence it is observed that in the case of wall confinement confinement height h is a limiting factor on vortex shedding suppression on the other hand from the work of wu et al 2004 it was observed that the higher blockage ratio results in earlier separation and minifies the separation angle measured from front stagnation point due to the local acceleration of flow around the cylinder however karman vortex street was found to be narrowed due to confinement and further increase in β β 0 5 leads to re stabilized steady flow the work of anagnostopoulos and iliadis 1996 and stansby and slaouti 1993 reported increased drag and strouhal number due to confinement some of these effects are also observed from the work of kanaris et al 2011 thus wall confinement leads to a stronger stream wise alignment of vortices and results in coherent and sustained vortices in the downstream further the interaction of vortices formed behind the cylinder and those originated near the confining walls leads to an inversion of von karman vortices camarri and giannetti 2010 have also observed that the inversion of wake vortices does affect the nature of the instability this inversion of vortices is reported by singha and sinhamahapatra 2010 which is due to the interaction between the vortices from the channel wall and cylinder wake in addition they have studied the vortex shedding characteristics for various channel heights and observed that the drag and strouhal number increase with decreasing channel height whereas lift decreases significantly price et al 2002 have experimentally studied the flow visualization around a circular cylinder near the confining rigid plain wall by varying gap between the cylinder and the plain wall they have categorized the gap into four different ranges based on the formation of vortex shedding from both the cylinder and the plain wall sahin et al 2004 have studied the β effect on vortex shedding characteristics and observed that at blockage ratios β 0 5 the vortex shedding over the cylinder was quite similar to that of the unbounded case they also found that the vortex street is shorter due to shear in the free stream increasing value of β leads to re stabilized steady flow this effect is also observed from the work of kanaris et al 2011 they have also observed that even though the primary vortex core is absent in the far downstream of the confined cylinder a stronger stream wise alignment of vortices is identified due to the wall confinement that result in coherency of hairpin vortices sustained for larger distance experimental investigations on steady and unsteady confined flow past circular cylinder with aspect ratio α 30 and blockage ratio β 1 3 was conducted by rehimi et al 2008 and the results were compared with unconfined flow von karman instability which occurs at re 47 for unconfined flow was delayed due to the confinement and found to occur at re 108 the delay in vortex shedding due to wall confinement was also observed and reported in the numerical study due to shaligram et al 2006 semin et al 2009 have studied the effect of confinement for flow parallel and perpendicular to the cylinder axes they have observed that for perpendicular flow the value of drag coefficient approaches the corresponding two dimensional flow only when β is very less than 1 the work from chen et al 1995 concludes that the physical structure nature of vortex formation and shedding of the flow does not change when blockage ratio is fairly small the available literature thus clearly shows the effect of wall confinement on vortex shedding characteristics especially confinement of the cylinder with high blockage ratio leads to vortex shedding suppression with the increased drag on the cylinder in order to reduce the drag deepakkumar et al 2016 2017a have used local waviness in the confining walls and achieved 15 43 drag reduction as compared with plain wall confined cylinder β 1 2 at reynolds number 200 the waviness located near the wake region using in phase configuration effectively suppresses the shedding has already been reported by deepakkumar et al 2016 but the drag on the cylinder was slightly increased as compared with plain wall confined cylinder later the authors extend the work consist of waviness using out phase configuration deepakkumar et al 2017a from the past literature it is noticed that wall proximity effect on vortex shedding characteristics will play a significant role in the wake region and especially the wavy wall proximity has high significance in the present work the effect of wavy wall proximity and the amplitude of the waviness effect on wake characteristics have been systematically studied in a two dimensional laminar flow regime also it is focused on identifying the suppression of vortex shedding with reduced drag on the cylinder 2 problem statement and solution methodology 2 1 problem statement the computational domain consists of circular cylinder confined between walls with local waviness as shown in fig 1 the length of the waviness considered is λ 2d d is the diameter of the cylinder the height of the domain is h 2d the amplitude of waviness a is taken as a simulation parameter which is discussed in section 4 3 attention is given to the proper placement of the inlet and outlet boundaries the inlet boundary is placed at 6d away from the cylinder to avoid numerical error propagation and to ensure the fully developed flow near the cylinder on the other hand to minimize the upstream effect of the exit boundary condition the outlet boundary is placed at 40d away from the cylinder center the detailed discussion on the effect of various locations of waviness on vortex shedding characteristics can be referred from deepakkumar et al 2016 2017a based on the work deepakkumar et al 2016 2017a the optimized location of waviness fig 1 is chosen in the present study for further investigation flow past circular cylinder at re 200 with no slip plain wall confinement β ½ ensures shedding sahin et al 2004 therefore in the present study to identify amplitude effect and corresponding critical reynolds number of first instability simulations are extended to a higher reynolds number for the confinement β ½ the reynolds number is defined as re ρ u max d μ 2 2 governing equations and boundary conditions 2 2 1 governing equations the equations governing the incompressible fluid flow in the present computational domain are described by the continuity and momentum equations in dimensionless form as follows continuity equation 1 u x v y 0 x momentum equation 2 u t u u x v u y p x 1 re 2 u x 2 2 u y 2 y momentum equation 3 v t u v x v v y p y 1 re 2 v x 2 2 v y 2 2 2 2 boundary conditions inlet as the present work is focused on wake characteristics due to flow past circular cylinder confined by rigid walls with local waviness near the cylinder the resulting flow characteristics are expected to be regulated due to local waviness only and not due to the flow development in upstream which approaches the cylinder therefore a parabolic velocity profile eqn 4 is imposed at the inlet of the computational domain by compiling a udf in fluent 4 u u max 1 y 2 h 2 2 v 0 exit at the exit as the computational downstream domain length is very long a fully developed flow i e the gradient along the flow direction is assumed to be zero 5 u x v x p x 0 surface of the cylinder lower and upper confining walls the cylinder surface and the confining walls are rigid solid boundaries thus no slip boundary condition is taken at these boundaries 6 u 0 v 0 2 3 numerical solution methodology block structured grid method is used for discretizing the entire computational domain with 12 blocks including o grid block o grid method is adopted for generating the grid around the cylinder as shown in fig 2 in order to avoid skewing of the grid very fine grid size is adopted in the wavy region a non uniform mesh with starting grid size of 0 001d and successive ratio of 1 1 is generated near to the solid boundaries this grid size ensures accurately capturing of flow characteristics near the cylinder the flow field variables are obtained by using the well established cfd code ansys fluent 15 0 the study is conducted in the unsteady region with 5 000 time steps which ensures numerical steadiness in the flow domain time step size 0 002 is chosen based on courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition the courant number is defined as u δ t δ x v δ t δ y the time step of the simulations has been chosen in such a way that the courant number is always less than 1 the numerical scheme coupled algorithm is taken for coupling pressure and velocity and the momentum and pressure based continuity equations are solved together second order implicit method is chosen for transient formulation the convergence criterion for residuals for continuity x velocity and y velocity components are taken as 1 10 6 3 significance of wavy wall confinement the previous work from deepakkumar et al 2017a demonstrates the effect of location of waviness in the confining walls on vortex shedding characteristics and its suppression the two possible ways of placing waviness with a crest in the downstream confining walls such as in phase configuration ipc and out phase configuration opc as shown in fig 3 can effectively suppress the vortex shedding at re 200 the locations for both ipc and opc are identified which completely suppress the shedding especially the waviness using out phase configuration completely suppresses the vortex shedding with reduced drag as compared with the waviness using in phase configuration and plain wall confined cylinder the amplitude of waviness and confinement ratio are a 0 15d and β 1 2 respectively the presence of waviness with crest near the cylinder wake reduces the flow cross section which leads to pressure build up in the wake region this increase in pressure in the wake region confines the growth of vortex size and thereby eliminates shedding of vortex from the cylinder surface the streamline plots for the plain wall confined and wall with waviness confined cylinder are shown in fig 4 a and b respectively the flow direction approaching the cylinder the gaps between the cylinder and the confining walls and the location of the crest region are the three major parameters that control the shedding characteristics the more details can be referred from deepakkumar et al 2017a 4 results and discussion the waviness with an amplitude of a 0 15d and the corresponding optimized configuration that suppresses the vortex shedding is discussed in section 3 amplitude a is expected to be one of the significant parameter that influences in two ways viz firstly in suppression or control of shedding characteristics and secondly in minimizing the drop in pressure in this section results in both steady and unsteady regions are systematically discussed for various amplitudes a 0 05d 0 1d 0 15d and 0 2d 4 1 grid independence and validation the numerical methodology of the present work of the wall confined cylinder has been validated with the results of sahin et al 2004 for the confinement of β 1 2 fig 5 shows the effect of reynolds number on the mean drag coefficient the results from the present study are compared with those available in the literature and the maximum and minimum deviation between the results are 1 82 and 0 06 at re 10 and re 40 respectively in order to ensure that the numerical results are independent with grid size and to obtain the optimum grid size with least expense of computational resources and improved solution accuracy a thorough grid independent test has been carried out for various reynolds numbers ranging from 20 to 200 instead of averaged quantity such as drag nodal point quantity base pressure coefficient is preferred deepakkumar et al 2017a to observe any minute variation in the value due to change in grid size and the results are shown in fig 6 the maximum variation in base pressure coefficient with respect to grid size is observed to be less than 4 however the maximum variation in averaged drag value is less than 0 2 the variation between the averaged quantity and the nodal point quantity with respect to various grid sizes has been reported also by deepakkumar et al 2017b 4 2 effect of amplitude at re 200 the fluctuations in drag lift and the base pressure coefficient for amplitude 0 05d and plain wall confined cylinder a 0 as shown in fig 7 a c shows the flow unsteadiness due to vortex shedding from cylinder this is also ensured by monitoring y component of velocity at different locations in the cylinder wake region fig 8 it is interesting to notice that the drag decreases with increasing amplitude up to a 0 15d fig 7a whereas at a 0 2d the drag increases the increase in amplitude leads to decrease in local confinement of the cylinder resulting in reduced drag the increased drag at a 0 2d is due to the crest region of local waviness which creates high blockage in the flow passage this can be easily observed from the base pressure coefficient fig 7c which shifts to negative for a 0 2d due to negative static pressure at the rear stagnation point there is no fluctuation in the lift for cases a 0 1d a 0 15d and a 0 2d due to the suppression of vortex shedding fig 6b the effect of local confinement is observed by monitoring x velocity at various y locations between the cylinder and the trough region at x d 0 fig 9 shows the x velocity variation with respect to time for different amplitude of waviness it is interesting to notice that the significance of solid wall boundary beyond a 0 15d is less for the velocity near to the cylinder boundary at y 0 6d fig 9a the time averaged x velocity is plotted with respect to various y locations for different amplitude of waviness fig 10 where a 0 represents plain wall confined cylinder the maximum velocity is observed near the boundary of cylinder surface at y 0 7d for all amplitudes of waviness thereafter the value decreases this increase in velocity is due to decreasing flow passage between the cylinder and the confining solid wall on the other hand formation of boundary layer near the confining cylinder leads to gradual decrease in velocity near the wall the presence of vortex shedding is observed for the amplitude a 0 05d further increase in amplitude a 0 1d 0 15d and 0 2d completely suppresses the vortex shedding the corresponding flow pattern is represented by streamlines which is shown in fig 11 the wavy crest in immediate downstream of the cylinder restricts the growth of vortex therefore the size of standing vortex decreases with increasing wave amplitude this kind of vortex size control also demonstrated by deepakkumar and jayavel 2017 but due to the interaction of circular and elliptical bodies the simulations are further extended for identifying the first instability in the wake of the cylinder with respect to different amplitude of waviness the total simulation time for all cases is taken as 75 s 15 000 time step with time step size of 0 005 the lift signal is monitored the symmetric vortex formation behind the cylinder generates zero lift with increasing reynolds number the appearance of small fluctuation in the lift ensures the instability the first instability in the wake is identified at reynolds number 141 195 262 and 339 respectively for the wave amplitude of 0 05d 0 1d 0 15d and 0 2d 4 3 effect of amplitude in the reynolds number range 20 and 125 the critical reynolds number for first instability of the flow past a cylinder with the confinement of β 1 2 is observed at re 125 23 sahin et al 2004 hence in order to identify effects of waviness amplitude on the wake characteristics in laminar steady regime simulations were conducted in the range 20 re 125 at low re the changes in amplitude has significant influence on drag fig 12a and less influence on recirculation length on the other hand as the reynolds number increases the amplitude of waviness is highly significant on recirculation length fig 12b it is interesting to notice that the drag coefficient decreases with increasing amplitude except a 0 2d for all reynolds numbers in order to better understand the two components of drag coefficients are monitored fig 13 shows the variation of pressure and friction drags with respect to reynolds number the increased drag for a 0 2d as compared to a 0 15d is due to increase in pressure drag for re 40 an increase in pressure drag as well as frictional drag for re 80 the increased crest height leads to higher frictional resistance over the cylinder surface therefore drag increases also it is observed that the trough region in the waviness controls the pressure drag whereas crest region controls the pressure drag as well as frictional drag the streamlines for various amplitudes and reynolds numbers are shown in fig 14 in general vortex size increases with increase in reynolds number for all amplitudes whereas the size decreases with increase in amplitude of waviness for all reynolds numbers for all reynolds numbers considered the vortex size is less for a 0 2d as compared to all other cases it is also noticed that there is no formation of vortex for all amplitudes of waviness at reynolds number 20 this is due to high confinement of the cylinder in addition to that the immediate crest in the local waviness in the confining walls generates a favorable pressure gradient and prevents flow separation 5 conclusion vortex shedding suppression and its control in a two dimensional flow over a circular cylinder are demonstrated using the technique local waviness in the confining walls it is found that the vortex shedding gets suppressed with reduced drag on the cylinder the effect of wave amplitude has been studied for different amplitudes a 0 05d 0 1d 0 15d and 0 2d the amplitude a 0 15d is identified as optimum based on the minimum drag and suppression of shedding for the confinement β ½ at reynolds number 200 simulations are also carried out in the steady flow region where significant reduction in vortex size is observed with increasing wave amplitude the trough region in the waviness controls the pressure drag whereas crest region controls the pressure drag as well as frictional drag further it will be more useful to study the confinement effect of local waviness by decreasing β values for the possibilities of vortex shedding suppression

1995 concludes that the physical structure nature of vortex formation and shedding of the flow does not change when blockage ratio is fairly small the available literature thus clearly shows the effect of wall confinement on vortex shedding characteristics especially confinement of the cylinder with high blockage ratio leads to vortex shedding suppression with the increased drag on the

past literature it is noticed that wall proximity effect on vortex shedding characteristics will play a significant role in the wake region and especially the wavy wall proximity has high significance in the present work the effect of wavy wall proximity and the amplitude of the waviness effect on wake characteristics have been systematically studied in a two dimensional laminar flow regime also it

from deepakkumar et al 2016 2017a based on the work deepakkumar et al 2016 2017a the optimized location of waviness fig 1 is chosen in the present study for further investigation flow past circular cylinder at re 200 with no slip plain wall confinement β ½ ensures shedding sahin et al 2004 therefore in the present study to identify amplitude effect and corresponding critical reynolds number of first instability simulations are extended to a higher reynolds number for the confinement β ½ the reynolds number is defined as re ρ u max d μ 2 2 governing equations and boundary conditions 2 2 1 governing equations the equations governing the incompressible fluid flow in the present computational domain are described by the continuity and momentum equations in dimensionless form as follows continuity equation 1 u x v y 0 x momentum equation 2 u t u u x v u y p x 1 re 2 u x 2 2 u y 2 y momentum equation 3 v t u v x v v y p y 1 re 2 v x 2 2 v y 2 2 2 2 boundary conditions inlet as the present work is focused on wake characteristics due to flow past circular cylinder confined by rigid walls with local waviness near the cylinder the resulting flow characteristics are expected to be regulated due to local waviness only and not due to the flow development in upstream which approaches the cylinder therefore a parabolic velocity profile eqn 4 is imposed at the inlet of the computational domain by compiling a udf in fluent 4 u u max 1 y 2 h 2 2 v 0 exit at the exit as the computational downstream domain length is very long a fully developed flow i e the gradient along the flow direction is assumed to be zero 5 u x v x p x 0 surface of the cylinder lower and upper confining walls the cylinder surface and the confining walls are rigid solid boundaries thus no slip boundary condition is taken at these boundaries 6 u 0 v 0 2 3 numerical solution methodology block structured grid method is used for discretizing the entire computational domain with 12 blocks including o grid block o grid method is adopted for generating the grid around the cylinder as shown in fig 2 in order to avoid skewing of the grid very fine grid size is adopted in the wavy region a non uniform mesh with starting grid size of 0 001d and successive ratio of 1 1 is generated near to the solid boundaries this grid size ensures accurately capturing of flow characteristics near the cylinder the flow field variables are obtained by using the well established cfd code ansys fluent 15 0 the study is conducted in the unsteady region with 5 000 time steps which ensures numerical steadiness in the flow domain time step size 0 002 is chosen based on courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition the courant number is defined as u δ t δ x v δ t δ y the time step of the simulations has been chosen in such a way that the courant number is always less than 1 the numerical scheme coupled algorithm is taken for coupling pressure and velocity and the momentum and pressure based continuity equations are solved together second order implicit method is chosen for transient formulation the convergence criterion for residuals for continuity x velocity and y velocity components are taken as 1 10 6 3 significance of wavy wall confinement the previous work from deepakkumar et al 2017a demonstrates the effect of location of waviness in the confining walls on vortex shedding characteristics and its suppression the two possible ways of placing waviness with a crest in the downstream confining walls such as in phase configuration ipc and out phase configuration opc as shown in fig 3 can effectively suppress the vortex shedding at re 200 the locations for both ipc and opc are identified which completely suppress the shedding especially the waviness using out phase configuration completely suppresses the vortex shedding with reduced drag as compared with the waviness using in phase configuration and plain wall confined cylinder the amplitude of waviness and confinement ratio are a 0 15d and β 1 2 respectively the presence of waviness with crest near the cylinder wake reduces the flow cross section which leads to pressure build up in the wake region this increase in pressure in the wake region confines the growth of vortex size and thereby eliminates shedding of vortex from the cylinder surface the streamline plots for the plain wall confined and wall with waviness confined cylinder are shown in fig 4 a and b respectively the flow direction approaching the cylinder the gaps between the cylinder and the confining walls and the location of the crest region are the three major parameters that control the shedding characteristics the more details can be referred from deepakkumar et al 2017a 4 results and discussion the waviness with an amplitude of a 0 15d and the corresponding optimized configuration that suppresses the vortex shedding is discussed in section 3 amplitude a is expected to be one of the significant parameter that influences in two ways viz firstly in suppression or control of shedding characteristics and secondly in minimizing the drop in pressure in this section results in both steady and unsteady regions are systematically discussed for various amplitudes a 0 05d 0 1d 0 15d and 0 2d 4 1 grid independence and validation the numerical methodology of the present work of the wall confined cylinder has been validated with the results of sahin et al 2004 for the confinement of β 1 2 fig 5 shows the effect of reynolds number on the mean drag coefficient the results from the present study are compared with those available in the literature and the maximum and minimum deviation between the results are 1 82 and 0 06 at re 10 and re 40 respectively in order to ensure that the numerical results are independent with grid size and to obtain the optimum grid size with least expense of computational resources and improved solution accuracy a thorough grid independent test has been carried out for various reynolds numbers ranging from 20 to 200 instead of averaged quantity such as drag nodal point quantity base pressure coefficient is preferred deepakkumar et al 2017a to observe any minute variation in the value due to change in grid size and the results are shown in fig 6 the maximum variation in base pressure coefficient with respect to grid size is observed to be less than 4 however the maximum variation in averaged drag value is less than 0 2 the variation between the averaged quantity and the nodal point quantity with respect to various grid sizes has been reported also by deepakkumar et al 2017b 4 2 effect of amplitude at re 200 the fluctuations in drag lift and the base pressure coefficient for amplitude 0 05d and plain wall confined cylinder a 0 as shown in fig 7 a c shows the flow unsteadiness due to vortex shedding from cylinder this is also ensured by monitoring y component of velocity at different locations in the cylinder wake region fig 8 it is interesting to notice that the drag decreases with increasing amplitude up to a 0 15d fig 7a whereas at a 0 2d the drag increases the increase in amplitude leads to decrease in local confinement of the cylinder resulting in reduced drag the increased drag at a 0 2d is due to the crest region of local waviness which creates high blockage in the flow passage this can be easily observed from the base pressure coefficient fig 7c which shifts to negative for a 0 2d due to negative static pressure at the rear stagnation point there is no fluctuation in the lift for cases a 0 1d a 0 15d and a 0 2d due to the suppression of vortex shedding fig 6b the effect of local confinement is observed by monitoring x velocity at various y locations between the cylinder and the trough region at x d 0 fig 9 shows the x velocity variation with respect to time for different amplitude of waviness it is interesting to notice that the significance of solid wall boundary beyond a 0 15d is less for the velocity near to the cylinder boundary at y 0 6d fig 9a the time averaged x velocity is plotted with respect to various y locations for different amplitude of waviness fig 10 where a 0 represents plain wall confined cylinder the maximum velocity is observed near the boundary of cylinder surface at y 0 7d for all amplitudes of waviness thereafter the value decreases this increase in velocity is due to decreasing flow passage between the cylinder and the confining solid wall on the other hand formation of boundary layer near the confining cylinder leads to gradual decrease in velocity near the wall the presence of vortex shedding is observed for the amplitude a 0 05d further increase in amplitude a 0 1d 0 15d and 0 2d completely suppresses the vortex shedding the corresponding flow pattern is represented by streamlines which is shown in fig 11 the wavy crest in immediate downstream of the cylinder restricts the growth of vortex therefore the size of standing vortex decreases with increasing wave amplitude this kind of vortex size control also demonstrated by deepakkumar and jayavel 2017 but due to the interaction of circular and elliptical bodies the simulations are further extended for identifying the first instability in the wake of the cylinder with respect to different amplitude of waviness the total simulation time for all cases is taken as 75 s 15 000 time step with time step size of 0 005 the lift signal is monitored the symmetric vortex formation behind the cylinder generates zero lift with increasing reynolds number the appearance of small fluctuation in the lift ensures the instability the first instability in the wake is identified at reynolds number 141 195 262 and 339 respectively for the wave amplitude of 0 05d 0 1d 0 15d and 0 2d 4 3 effect of amplitude in the reynolds number range 20 and 125 the critical reynolds number for first instability of the flow past a cylinder with the confinement of β 1 2 is observed at re 125 23 sahin et al 2004 hence in order to identify effects of waviness amplitude on the wake characteristics in laminar steady regime simulations were conducted in the range 20 re 125 at low re the changes in amplitude has significant influence on drag fig 12a and less influence on recirculation length on the other hand as the reynolds number increases the amplitude of waviness is highly significant on recirculation length fig 12b it is interesting to notice that the drag coefficient decreases with increasing amplitude except a 0 2d for all reynolds numbers in order to better understand the two components of drag coefficients are monitored fig 13 shows the variation of pressure and friction drags with respect to reynolds number the increased drag for a 0 2d as compared to a 0 15d is due to increase in pressure drag for re 40 an increase in pressure drag as well as frictional drag for re 80 the increased crest height leads to higher frictional resistance over the cylinder surface therefore drag increases also it is observed that the trough region in the waviness controls the pressure drag whereas crest region controls the pressure drag as well as frictional drag the streamlines for various amplitudes and reynolds numbers are shown in fig 14 in general vortex size increases with increase in reynolds number for all amplitudes whereas the size decreases with increase in amplitude of waviness for all reynolds numbers for all reynolds numbers considered the vortex size is less for a 0 2d as compared to all other cases it is also noticed that there is no formation of vortex for all amplitudes of waviness at reynolds number 20 this is due to high confinement of the cylinder in addition to that the immediate crest in the local waviness in the confining walls generates a favorable pressure gradient and prevents flow separation 5 conclusion vortex shedding suppression and its control in a two dimensional flow over a circular cylinder are demonstrated using the technique local waviness in the confining walls it is found that the vortex shedding gets suppressed with reduced drag on the cylinder the effect of wave amplitude has been studied for different amplitudes a 0 05d 0 1d 0 15d and 0 2d the amplitude a 0 15d is identified as optimum based on the minimum drag and suppression of shedding for the confinement β ½ at reynolds number 200 simulations are also carried out in the steady flow region where significant reduction in vortex size is observed with increasing wave amplitude the trough region in the waviness controls the pressure drag whereas crest region controls the pressure drag as well as frictional drag further it will be more useful to study the confinement effect of local waviness by decreasing β values for the possibilities of vortex shedding suppression

controller optimized by the genetic algorithm ensures that the vehicle sails along the expected path also the system shows strong robustness keywords underwater vehicle path tracking fuzzy control genetic algorithm 1 introduction the environment in the ocean is complex with predictable factors such as submarine topography and also with many unpredictable factors such as currents and waves marine creatures etc these factors are likely to affect the working of underwater robots xuezhi 2010 prabhakar and buckham 2005 especially for tasks with accuracy requirements therefore studying on the control system for underwater robots is critical for the efficient work of robots under water healey and lienard 1993 and the motion control technique is important for realizing the required motion and achieving a stable driving condition of the underwater vehicles which is essential for underwater tasks with accuracy requirements mamdani and assilian 1975 at present the commonly used methods for navigation control of underwater vehicles mainly include pid control adaptive control synovial control fuzzy control and neural network control at home and abroad shaocheng 2005 as an important control method fuzzy control has the most prominent advantage that is not only dependent on the precise mathematical model of the control system but also can effectively control the nonlinear system it has strong robustness and anti interference ability the disadvantage is that it is difficult to ensure that the control system has good stability and sensitivity debitetto 1994 and genetic algorithm has fast and random search capabilities in this paper based on the characteristics of fuzzy control and the advantages of genetic algorithm a novel fuzzy controller is designed for the path tracking control of underwater machines the motion control i e path tracking method for a self made prototype of underwater vehicle sea dog is developed with a fuzzy controller that is optimized by genetic algorithm which is tested by both simulation and experiment 2 design of the path tracking controller based on the fuzzy theory sea dog is different from ordinary rov which uses a three tier frame design huhman and neri 2012 lygouras et al 1998 two features are as follows 1 its center of gravity coincides with the origin of the motion coordinate system 2 taking into account the simplification of modeling the up and down the front and back and the upper and lower of the vehicle as approximately symmetrical in order to facilitate the description of the motion of the vehicle the coordinate origin o of the coordinate system can be taken at any point on the vehicle the axis x is consistent with the main symmetry axis of the vehicle the axis y is consistent with the auxiliary axis of symmetry of the vehicle the axis z points to the bottom of underwater robot the coordinate system selection is shown in fig 1 the path tracking control for the underwater vehicle sea dog is a mixed path tracking control which considers the movement in both the horizontal plane and the vertical plane jing zheng and xu 2007 in the control process when the coordinates of the target location and the current location are given the expected heading and pitch angles at the expected velocity of the vehicle are obtained according to the path solver in which the calculation method on special error is adopted then the fuzzy controller eliminates the error between the practical and the expected heading angle velocity and pitch receptively thereby indirectly makes the vehicle approach the expected path the fuzzy controller section forms an accurate control system for the tracking of the curved path in space by the fuzzy algorithm the corresponding ration speed of the propeller can be obtained to adjust the motion of the vehicle the diagram of the control system is shown in fig 2 fig 3 shows the diagram horizontal path tracking of the vehicle here we take the horizontal path tracking as an example as shown in fig 2 the red curve is the expected path of the vehicle o is the starting point a is the current position of the vehicle and b is the target position the coordinates of point a and b are set as x a y a and x b y b respectively as a result the expected sailing direction in segment ab is 1 ψ d tan 1 y y d x x d the distance of the vehicle form the expected path i e tracking error d a d can be expressed as 2 d a o sin arctan y b x b arctan y a x a the traveling distance l is defined as the distance between the vehicle position a and the line that is perpendicular to the line ob through the target point b as the target reference line represents an interface the positive direction of l is defined as the direction from o to b l is used to determine whether the vehicle enters the next segment and is related to the position of point b zhuang 2000 l can be obtained by the follow equation 3 l s a b c o s arctan x b x a ψ d during horizontal path tracking we divide the given curved path into several segments as shown in fig 3 point b is the target point for the vehicle in the current segment according to the current position of vehicle the controller determines the segment that the vehicle is currently in and consequently determines the target point for the vehicle in the current segment in this way the vehicle quickly enters the control state of path tracking yi and heng 2002 liu 2009 xing 2010 the detailed solution is as follows starting from the previous segment according to eqs 1 3 the distance l in fig 3 is determined to check whether it is less than 0 that is to say whether the target point has been passed if it has been passed l for the next target point is checked when l is larger than 0 the segment is determined as the current segment for the vehicle the fuzzy controller of horizontal path tracking is a two dimensional fuzzy controller the inputs are the heading angle deviation and heading angle deviation rate the corresponding subordinate function is shown in fig 4 there are 49 fuzzy rules for heading angle adjustment according to the practical experience which are shown in table 1 the weighted average method is adopt for defuzzification 3 the fuzzy controller optimized by genetic algorithm the performance of the fuzzy logic controller depends on whether a high performance subordinate function and reasonable fuzzy rules are used the subordinate function is basically determined by the trial and error method in practice which is cumbersome and lack of adaptability maji et al 2016 the control rules and subordinate functions of the fuzzy controller are affected by some subjective factors which have a great influence on the performance of the fuzzy controller zhang et al 2004 the genetic algorithm is introduced in the design of the fuzzy controller which optimize the subordinate function and fuzzy control rules simultaneously genetic algorithm is a global search algorithm which is no requirement for the field of the matter first of all it is need to determine the solution space of the problem based on the description of the optimization problem so that the optimization model can be established and the objective function can be determined based on the model at the same time the coding method of chromosome need to be determined and the search space of genetic algorithm will be obtained finally to determine the individual fitness evaluation method and design of genetic operators and determine the relevant operating parameters chen 1999 xiying et al 2014 in this study the float encoding is used and each chromosome corresponds to a fuzzy controller xiaoqin 2003 we use the two floating point numbers in the specification interval 1 1 to constitute the triangular subordinate function the first number indicates the position of the fixed point x and the second number is the half of the width of the bottom l taking the horizontal path tracing as an example the subordinate function for each linguistic variable is bilaterally symmetrical as shown in fig 5 for each subordinate function a total of six parameters need to be adjusted with the adding the code from the rule set taking the heading angle controller as an example its fuzzy control rule is encoded as 49 bits and the input of subordinate functions for heading angle deviation and deviation rate needs 12 bits float encoding therefore a total encoding length of 61 bits is needed the detailed code is shown in table 2 the crossover probability and the mutation probability are important factors in the genetic algorithm therefore in order to consider both accuracy and efficiency a reasonable adoption of the two probability is essential here a new adaptable scheme is proposed in the selection of crossover probability and mutation probability 4 p c 0 55 0 2 f max f a v g f c f c f a v g f max f a v g f c 0 75 o t h e r 5 p m 0 55 f max f m f max f a v g f m f a v g 0 05 f m f a v g where f max is the maximum fitness of the current population f a v g is the average fitness of the current population f c is individual fitness for cross operation f m is the individual fitness for mutation operation in the improved scheme the selection of two probabilities are divided into two conditions according to the degree of individual fitness when the individual fitness is greater than the average fitness of the population the crossover probability and the mutation probability are chosen to be relatively small and f max f a v g reflects the dispersion of the fitness of population when f max f a v g is large the fitness of population is more dispersed and the crossover probability is increased compared to the original basis and the mutation probability decreases by this way the convergence rate of the algorithm is accelerated similarly if f max f a v g is relatively small the fitness of population is more concentrated the mutation probability increases and the crossover probability decreases which increases the diversity of the population through this setting the influence of the dispersion of the population fitness on the selection of the two probabilities is fully taken into account on the contrary when the individual fitness is less than the average fitness of population choosing large crossover and mutation probabilities can improve the quality of the genetic algorithm 4 simulation verification genetic algorithm is a global optimization algorithm montazeri gh et al 2006 deb et al 2000 wang et al 2005 tiwari et al 2013 radmehr et al 2015 the original fuzzy controller is optimized by the genetic algorithm with the adoption of the rule of synchronous search fuzzy control and the subordinate function at first the optimized fuzzy controller is determined by the genetic algorithm then the simulation of tracking control on sinusoidal path is carried out by simulink which simulates the disturbance of the continuous time varying current results are compared with the simulation using conventional fuzzy controller the flow chart of the simulation is shown in fig 6 after 28 generations the optimal solution is obtained with the optimal individual vertex coding 0 123 0 419 0 225 0 632 and the half of width at the bottom is encoded as 0 152 0 428 0 906 0 0 285 0 564 0 928 the corresponding optimal fuzzy control table of the heading angle is shown in table 3 by genetic algorithm the optimal fuzzy controller of the pitch angle the heading angle and the vehicle speed are obtained in sequence and simulation on the path tracking of the self made underwater vehicle sea dog is carried out the sine curve for a given horizontal plane is defined as unit m 6 y d 10 sin x d 20 π z d 3 5 3 sin x d 20 π considering the change of the velocity of the continuous time varying current with the depth is more obvious we ignore the change in velocity at the same level assuming that the velocity of the current varies linearly with depth unit kn zeng et al 2015 7 μ c u r 0 3 3 65 z 0 z 6 5 the flow direction is along x axis and z is the depth in water the initial position of sea dog is set as x y z 0 0 0 35 m with the initial euler angle φ θ ψ 0 0 0 and the initial velocity u v w 0 0 0 k n the expected velocity u 0 4 k n then the vehicle is simulated in three dimensional space for non fixed depth of movement the effects of controllers on the path tracking in the xy and xz plane are shown in fig 7 and fig 8 respectively both the controllers with and without genetic algorithm can realize the path tracking for the vehicle under continuous time varying current interference however the error using the controller with genetic algorithm is obviously smaller than that using the conventional fuzzy controller the using of genetic algorithm improves the tracking accuracy as shown in fig 8 and table 4 the fuzzy controller optimized by genetic algorithm has a stronger suppression on the disturbance by the continuous time varying current see fig 9 fig 10 shows the error of the navigation velocity with the velocity control using fuzzy controller based on the genetic algorithm optimization there is an overshoot of 7 while without algorithm optimization not only is there an overshoot of 13 but also delayed response about 2 s it can be seen that the optimized fuzzy controller dose a better job on the tracking of the velocity for the vehicle fig 11 indicates the error of the heading angle we can see that in case of large current interference there is less fluctuation with the fuzzy controller based on genetic algorithm optimization and the stability of the heading angle using the conventional fuzzy controller is not as good as that of the fuzzy controller even when the current is small fig 11 shows the tilt angle error of the vehicle in case of large current when using fuzzy controller based on genetic algorithm the error is also much less which quickly achieves the stable state see fig 12 current is one of the most important factors affecting the movement of underwater vehicles petitt et al 2004 yandell et al 2003 the consequent of the fuzzy controller based on genetic algorithm optimization and the conventional fuzzy controller in case of current disturbances should be compared in fig 13 the former has a standard error of path tracking of 0 258 m and the latter has a standard error of 0 372 m for path tracking the contrast of errors in the current size changes is particularly obvious it can be seen from the simulation that the fuzzy controller based on genetic algorithm optimization has realized the path tracking control for sea dog with the precision and stability improved evidently it is found that the combination genetic algorithm and increases sensitivity and accuracy which eliminates the trial and error process and increases sensitivity and accuracy as long as we construct a appropriate mathematical model for the control object we can use the genetic algorithm to develop a satisfactory fuzzy controller 5 experimental study on the underwater vehicle sea dog the path tracking experiment is applied using a self made underwater vehicle paths with straight and curved line are used in the path tracking experiment due to the limited size of the pool the sea dog was tested at low velocity as shown in fig 14 comparison are made with results using the fuzzy controller with and without the genetic algorithm guo and yuan 2009 wen et al 2013 donovan 2012 results of the straight line tracking is shown in fig 15 in the straight line tracking experiment the heading angle of the vehicle is set to have a large disparity compared to the target heading angle which mainly examines the ability of the self adjust of the controller two reference points are set in the expected path which divide the straight path into three segments the reference points are 0 5 0 and 1 0 respectively in the first step the vehicle moves towards the reference point 0 5 0 and reaches the point as a target point thereafter the controller will automatically shift the target point to the next reference point 1 0 it is shown in the straight line path tracking experiment that when the initial deflection of the heading angle is large the vehicle adjusts the heading angle to the expected value more quickly with the optimized fuzzy controller compared to the one with conventional fuzzy controller although there is a small overshoot for the first time the vehicle achieves the expected path the vehicle can be gently adjusted to maintain the final moving direction that is consistent with the straight line path furthermore the practical path realized by the optimized fuzzy controller is more stable than the one by the conventional fuzzy controller as shown in fig 16 results of the path tracking experiment with curved line is shown in fig 16 in the test three reference points are chosen in the straight line part of the expected path and nine reference points in the arc part from the experimental results it can be seen that the optimized controller can ensure that the vehicle is approaching the segments in the straight line part quickly and tracking smoothly when the initial deviation of the heading angle is small the expected path becomes curved after the reference point 0 8 0 6 and the vehicle is still able to track the curve with a better capability of self adjusting from the path tracking experiment with both straight and curved lines we can see that by setting the first reference points in the expected path the vehicle can approach the path using both the control algorithms with and without optimization while with the help of the optimized controller the vehicle approaches the expected path by eliminating the tracking error and at the same time maintains a small heading angle deviation after which the heading angle is adjusted smoothly to realize the path tracking the fuzzy controller with genetic algorithm optimization also shows a good self adjusting performance when there is a large turn between different segments in the expected path the controller eliminates the tracking error and direct the vehicle to reach the reference point target in the planed path with a small deviation of the heading angle the vehicle can maintain a stable path tracking state with a gentle turn between the segments 6 conclusion we present the design of a fuzzy controller with genetic algorithm for the path tracking problem of underwater vehicles simulation using simulink is carried out to check the improvements on the path tracking with the optimized fuzzy controller which is also confirmed by the experiment with a self made underwater vehicle sea dog the main results of this paper are as follows 1 the simulation shows that the optimized controller has better anti interference and precision performance than the conventional controller 2 the experiment shows that the path tracking is stable and flexible using the optimized fuzzy controller it can be seen from the experimental results that the optimized controller can ensure that the vehicle is approaching quickly to the expected path and more smoothly tracking the straight line path after the expected path becomes a curve segment the vehicle also tracks the segment better this work needs to be further carried out follow up should be designed to better track the desired path curve method that is the shortest path or the required minimum control energy a pool experiment was carried out followed by a deep water path tracing experiment under current

determine whether the vehicle enters the next segment and is related to the position of point b zhuang 2000 l can be obtained by the follow equation 3 l s a b c o s arctan x b x a ψ d during horizontal path tracking we divide the given curved path into several segments as shown in fig 3 point b is the target point for the vehicle in the current segment according to the current position of vehicle the controller determines the segment that the vehicle is currently in and consequently determines the target point for the vehicle in the current segment in this way the vehicle quickly enters the control state of path tracking yi and heng 2002 liu 2009 xing 2010 the detailed solution is as follows starting from the previous segment according to eqs 1 3 the distance l in fig 3 is determined to check whether it is less than 0 that is to say whether the target point has been passed if it has been passed l for the next target point is checked when l is larger than 0 the segment is determined as the current segment for the vehicle the fuzzy controller of horizontal path tracking is a two dimensional fuzzy controller the inputs are the heading angle deviation and heading angle deviation rate the corresponding subordinate function is shown in fig 4 there are 49 fuzzy rules for heading angle adjustment according to the practical experience which are shown in table 1 the weighted average method is adopt for defuzzification 3 the fuzzy controller optimized by genetic algorithm the performance of the fuzzy logic controller depends on whether a high performance subordinate function and reasonable fuzzy rules are used the subordinate function is basically determined by the trial and error method in practice which is cumbersome and lack of adaptability maji et al 2016 the control rules and subordinate functions of the fuzzy controller are affected by some subjective factors which have a great influence on the performance of the fuzzy controller zhang et al 2004 the genetic algorithm is introduced in the design of the fuzzy controller which optimize the subordinate function and fuzzy control rules simultaneously genetic algorithm is a global search algorithm which is no requirement for the field of the matter first of all it is need to determine the solution space of the problem based on the description of the optimization problem so that the optimization model can be established and the objective function can be determined based on the model at the same time the coding method of chromosome need to be determined and the search space of genetic algorithm will be obtained finally to determine the individual fitness evaluation method and design of genetic operators and determine the relevant operating parameters chen 1999 xiying et al 2014 in this study the float encoding is used and each chromosome corresponds to a fuzzy controller xiaoqin 2003 we use the two floating point numbers in the specification interval 1 1 to constitute the triangular subordinate function the first number indicates the position of the fixed point x and the second number is the half of the width of the bottom l taking the horizontal path tracing as an example the subordinate function for each linguistic variable is bilaterally symmetrical as shown in fig 5 for each subordinate function a total of six parameters need to be adjusted with the adding the code from the rule set taking the heading angle controller as an example its fuzzy control rule is encoded as 49 bits and the input of subordinate functions for heading angle deviation and deviation rate needs 12 bits float encoding therefore a total encoding length of 61 bits is needed the detailed code is shown in table 2 the crossover probability and the mutation probability are important factors in the genetic algorithm therefore in order to consider both accuracy and efficiency a reasonable adoption of the two probability is essential here a new adaptable scheme is proposed in the selection of crossover probability and mutation probability 4 p c 0 55 0 2 f max f a v g f c f c f a v g f max f a v g f c 0 75 o t h e r 5 p m 0 55 f max f m f max f a v g f m f a v g 0 05 f m f a v g where f max is the maximum fitness of the current population f a v g is the average fitness of the current population f c is individual fitness for cross operation f m is the individual fitness for mutation operation in the improved scheme the selection of two probabilities are divided into two conditions according to the degree of individual fitness when the individual fitness is greater than the average fitness of the population the crossover probability and the mutation probability are chosen to be relatively small and f max f a v g reflects the dispersion of the fitness of population when f max f a v g is large the fitness of population is more dispersed and the crossover probability is increased compared to the original basis and the mutation probability decreases by this way the convergence rate of the algorithm is accelerated similarly if f max f a v g is relatively small the fitness of population is more concentrated the mutation probability increases and the crossover probability decreases which increases the diversity of the population through this setting the influence of the dispersion of the population fitness on the selection of the two probabilities is fully taken into account on the contrary when the individual fitness is less than the average fitness of population choosing large crossover and mutation probabilities can improve the quality of the genetic algorithm 4 simulation verification genetic algorithm is a global optimization algorithm montazeri gh et al 2006 deb et al 2000 wang et al 2005 tiwari et al 2013 radmehr et al 2015 the original fuzzy controller is optimized by the genetic algorithm with the adoption of the rule of synchronous search fuzzy control and the subordinate function at first the optimized fuzzy controller is determined by the genetic algorithm then the simulation of tracking control on sinusoidal path is carried out by simulink which simulates the disturbance of the continuous time varying current results are compared with the simulation using conventional fuzzy controller the flow chart of the simulation is shown in fig 6 after 28 generations the optimal solution is obtained with the optimal individual vertex coding 0 123 0 419 0 225 0 632 and the half of width at the bottom is encoded as 0 152 0 428 0 906 0 0 285 0 564 0 928 the corresponding optimal fuzzy control table of the heading angle is shown in table 3 by genetic algorithm the optimal fuzzy controller of the pitch angle the heading angle and the vehicle speed are obtained in sequence and simulation on the path tracking of the self made underwater vehicle sea dog is carried out the sine curve for a given horizontal plane is defined as unit m 6 y d 10 sin x d 20 π z d 3 5 3 sin x d 20 π considering the change of the velocity of the continuous time varying current with the depth is more obvious we ignore the change in velocity at the same level assuming that the velocity of the current varies linearly with depth unit kn zeng et al 2015 7 μ c u r 0 3 3 65 z 0 z 6 5 the flow direction is along x axis and z is the depth in water the initial position of sea dog is set as x y z 0 0 0 35 m with the initial euler angle φ θ ψ 0 0 0 and the initial velocity u v w 0 0 0 k n the expected velocity u 0 4 k n then the vehicle is simulated in three dimensional space for non fixed depth of movement the effects of controllers on the path tracking in the xy and xz plane are shown in fig 7 and fig 8 respectively both the controllers with and without genetic algorithm can realize the path tracking for the vehicle under continuous time varying current interference however the error using the controller with genetic algorithm is obviously smaller than that using the conventional fuzzy controller the using of genetic algorithm improves the tracking accuracy as shown in fig 8 and table 4 the fuzzy controller optimized by genetic algorithm has a stronger suppression on the disturbance by the continuous time varying current see fig 9 fig 10 shows the error of the navigation velocity with the velocity control using fuzzy controller based on the genetic algorithm optimization there is an overshoot of 7 while without algorithm optimization not only is there an overshoot of 13 but also delayed response about 2 s it can be seen that the optimized fuzzy controller dose a better job on the tracking of the velocity for the vehicle fig 11 indicates the error of the heading angle we can see that in case of large current interference there is less fluctuation with the fuzzy controller based on genetic algorithm optimization and the stability of the heading angle using the conventional fuzzy controller is not as good as that of the fuzzy controller even when the current is small fig 11 shows the tilt angle error of the vehicle in case of large current when using fuzzy controller based on genetic algorithm the error is also much less which quickly achieves the stable state see fig 12 current is one of the most important factors affecting the movement of underwater vehicles petitt et al 2004 yandell et al 2003 the consequent of the fuzzy controller based on genetic algorithm optimization and the conventional fuzzy controller in case of current disturbances should be compared in fig 13 the former has a standard error of path tracking of 0 258 m and the latter has a standard error of 0 372 m for path tracking the contrast of errors in the current size changes is particularly obvious it can be seen from the simulation that the fuzzy controller based on genetic algorithm optimization has realized the path tracking control for sea dog with the precision and stability improved evidently it is found that the combination genetic algorithm and increases sensitivity and accuracy which eliminates the trial and error process and increases sensitivity and accuracy as long as we construct a appropriate mathematical model for the control object we can use the genetic algorithm to develop a satisfactory fuzzy controller 5 experimental study on the underwater vehicle sea dog the path tracking experiment is applied using a self made underwater vehicle paths with straight and curved line are used in the path tracking experiment due to the limited size of the pool the sea dog was tested at low velocity as shown in fig 14 comparison are made with results using the fuzzy controller with and without the genetic algorithm guo and yuan 2009 wen et al 2013 donovan 2012 results of the straight line tracking is shown in fig 15 in the straight line tracking experiment the heading angle of the vehicle is set to have a large disparity compared to the target heading angle which mainly examines the ability of the self adjust of the controller two reference points are set in the expected path which divide the straight path into three segments the reference points are 0 5 0 and 1 0 respectively in the first step the vehicle moves towards the reference point 0 5 0 and reaches the point as a target point thereafter the controller will automatically shift the target point to the next reference point 1 0 it is shown in the straight line path tracking experiment that when the initial deflection of the heading angle is large the vehicle adjusts the heading angle to the expected value more quickly with the optimized fuzzy controller compared to the one with conventional fuzzy controller although there is a small overshoot for the first time the vehicle achieves the expected path the vehicle can be gently adjusted to maintain the final moving direction that is consistent with the straight line path furthermore the practical path realized by the optimized fuzzy controller is more stable than the one by the conventional fuzzy controller as shown in fig 16 results of the path tracking experiment with curved line is shown in fig 16 in the test three reference points are chosen in the straight line part of the expected path and nine reference points in the arc part from the experimental results it can be seen that the optimized controller can ensure that the vehicle is approaching the segments in the straight line part quickly and tracking smoothly when the initial deviation of the heading angle is small the expected path becomes curved after the reference point 0 8 0 6 and the vehicle is still able to track the curve with a better capability of self adjusting from the path tracking experiment with both straight and curved lines we can see that by setting the first reference points in the expected path the vehicle can approach the path using both the control algorithms with and without optimization while with the help of the optimized controller the vehicle approaches the expected path by eliminating the tracking error and at the same time maintains a small heading angle deviation after which the heading angle is adjusted smoothly to realize the path tracking the fuzzy controller with genetic algorithm optimization also shows a good self adjusting performance when there is a large turn between different segments in the expected path the controller eliminates the tracking error and direct the vehicle to reach the reference point target in the planed path with a small deviation of the heading angle the vehicle can maintain a stable path tracking state with a gentle turn between the segments 6 conclusion we present the design of a fuzzy controller with genetic algorithm for the path tracking problem of underwater vehicles simulation using simulink is carried out to check the improvements on the path tracking with the optimized fuzzy controller which is also confirmed by the experiment with a self made underwater vehicle sea dog the main results of this paper are as follows 1 the simulation shows that the optimized controller has better anti interference and precision performance than the conventional controller 2 the experiment shows that the path tracking is stable and flexible using the optimized fuzzy controller it can be seen from the experimental results that the optimized controller can ensure that the vehicle is approaching quickly to the expected path and more smoothly tracking the straight line path after the expected path becomes a curve segment the vehicle also tracks the segment better this work needs to be further carried out follow up should be designed to better track the desired path curve method that is the shortest path or the required minimum control energy a pool experiment was carried out followed by a deep water path tracing experiment under current
