21275,a new step by step dynamic response analysis method is proposed for fixed offshore structures in the time domain with high order accuracy the basic principle of the proposed method is to normalise an arbitrary loading into the form of complex exponents with arbitrary order derivatives permitting the high order taylor expansion of dynamic response components acceleration velocity and displacement in theory the proposed method is more accurate than other proposed methods especially for structures subjected to short term high energy loading with data collected using a limited sampling frequency the response obtained has higher order accuracy than that obtained with the widely used newmark β method which only has second order accuracy because of the assumption of acceleration linearisation four examples are used to demonstrate the correctness and accuracy of the proposed method the first numerical example uses a single degree of freedom sdof system to demonstrate the calculated results obtained using different orders of taylor expansion with the proposed method the comparison with the analytical result and the result obtained with the newmark β method shows that the proposed method is less sensitive to the sampling frequency and that even the accuracy of the third order taylor expansion based method is higher than that of the newmark β method in the second example the third order taylor expansion based method is used to calculate the dynamic response of a three degree of freedom 3dof system under earthquake excitation sampled at a fixed frequency to show that the proposed method can determine the structural dynamic response under an arbitrary form of loading better accuracy than the newmark β method in the third example a numerical monopile offshore wind turbine owt is used for verifying the feasibility of the proposed method in calculating the dynamic response of fixed offshore structures finally measurements of a cantilever beam with similar properties of monopile owt under harmonic excitations and random excitations are used to demonstrate the proposed method and illustrate its potential values for application to dynamic response analysis of fixed offshore structures keywords dynamic response fixed offshore structures high order accuracy taylor expansion complex exponential decomposition newmark β method 1 introduction to ensure the safe operation of fixed offshore structures during their service life such as fixed offshore platforms and monopile offshore wind turbines owts the structural design is developed from the simple strength design stage to the reliability design stage the process of structural dynamic design is no longer a simple process of calculation of structural dynamic characteristics but rather has gradually developed into the process of dynamic response analysis of an entire structure traditional structural dynamic response analysis methods are mainly divided into frequency and time domain methods wei et al 2018 frequency domain methods are fast and simple to solve but they are limited in application to linear time invariant systems that is to systems in which the geometric and physical parameters of structures are linear and do not change with time and for which the external loading is linear although some weakly nonlinear system can be solved in the frequency domain for most dynamic analysis problems in nonlinear systems the frequency domain methods are still not applicable and only step by step time domain methods can be used liu et al 2017 with the development of computer technology and numerical calculation methods time domain methods have become indispensable for structural design and analysis most time domain methods such as the newmark β method jin and gou 2018 the wilson θ method yang and wang 2008 and the central difference method yankovskii 2017 describe problems of structural dynamic response analysis in terms of second order differential equations and use step by step integration to obtain the solution however these methods are all linear methods that can only achieve second order accuracy in ensuring unconditional stability wang et al 2017 a method that can achieve higher order accuracy can provide more accurate results and is more conducive to long term prediction of structural response which is very important for structural dynamic design and analysis fung 1997 to obtain a high order solution of the equation of motion borri and borrasso 1993 introduced a discontinuous galerkin function and obtained a series of high order algorithms although the series of high order algorithms proved to be unconditionally stable cusps cannot be avoided in the spectral radii diagram and the results of response in the mid frequency range will have more algorithmic damping based on the newmark β method austin 1993 used the romberg extrapolation method to perform calculations in each time step and the results were evaluated several times over different lengths of steps to improve the accuracy of the results although the numerical results obtained show that application of the newmark method using the romberg extrapolation achieve high accuracy minor time steps are needed to maintain numerical stability the taylor expansion method is easy to implement and has been widely used in various fields taylor expansion splits a complex function into simple polynomials which does not simplify the process of solving the original complex function but does permit selection of an appropriate expansion order to satisfy the calculation accuracy requirements and reduce the complexity of the calculation chen et al 2015 at present the taylor expansion has been widely applied in structural analysis duan et al 2020 farahani and bahai 2004 proposed a first order inverse strategy for relocation of natural frequencies by performing a sensitivity analysis of structural eigenvalues with respect to material or geometric parameters and then calculated the parameter variation to achieve a desired frequency shift using the taylor expansion method to extend the proposed first order method to the second order these formulas have been proven to be very general and applicable to all finite element structures wang and yuan 2017 applied taylor expansion to eliminate virtual nodes outside the physical domain and overcome the problems encountered in high order frequency analysis a comparison of the results and the exact solutions showed that using the taylor expansion method to solve the boundary conditions produced a universal and accurate solution that was unaffected by the boundary conditions li et al 2017 used the taylor expansion method to extend the first order partial derivatives of eigenvalues to the second order and then model problems of structural eigenvalues with interval parameters as quadratic programming series with box constraints qb overcoming the problem of the first order method not being applicable to structural eigenvalues with interval parameters however when using taylor expansion to solve the second order differential equation of motion it is difficult to obtain the high order derivatives of the external loading because of its unknown form and this problem limits the applicability of taylor expansion in dynamic response analysis therefore if an arbitrary external loading can be decomposed as a set of functions that have high order derivation taylor expansion can be introduced to solve the equation of motion traditional decomposition methods are mainly divided into fourier based and empirical methods fourier based methods such as fourier decomposition and wavelet decomposition zhang and cheng 2016 are based on the assumption of periodicity when dealing with complex excitations the decomposed results often cannot achieve the required precision empirical methods have been widely used for the decomposition of complex nonlinear signals as empirical mode decomposition huang et al 1998 and ensemble empirical mode decomposition wu and huang 2009 however empirical methods cannot obtain the expression of functions tai et al 2019 prony s method uses complex exponential functions to represent signals which makes it possible to avoid the assumption of periodicity prony 1795 however when using the traditional prony method the calculation of the polynomials is an ill conditioned problem and round off errors exist for the linear prediction parameters consequently the prony method is sensitive to noise and is difficult to be applied in engineering practice in 2013 hu et al 2013 introduced a low order state space model based on prony s method called prony ss to transform the high order differential equation into a first order differential equation and overcome the ill conditioned problem of the traditional prony method liu et al 2020a this approach achieves a high accuracy decomposition and expression of complex signals in arbitrary form as a sum of complex exponential functions the prony ss method has been widely used in offshore structures and has shown good performance liu et al 2018 2019b tian et al 2020 based on a normalised expression of arbitrary loading a new dynamic response analysis method for fixed offshore structures is proposed in this paper the proposed method can achieve solutions with higher order accuracy than methods based on traditional second order differential equations essentially the novelty of the proposed method is to obtain the derivative of the external loading and employ taylor expansion in the dynamic response analysis four examples are presented in this paper to illustrate this proposed method first a single degree of freedom sdof system is used for comparison of analytical results results obtained with the newmark β method and results obtained with third fourth and fifth order taylor expansions second a three degree of freedom 3dof system under earthquake excitation and a numerical monopile owt under wave forces are used to demonstrate the correctness of the structural dynamic response obtained using the proposed method under arbitrary loadings finally data from an experiment involving a cantilever beam under harmonic excitations and random excitations are used to demonstrate a practical application of the proposed method 2 preliminaries 2 1 taylor expansion the taylor expansion has been widely used because of its simplicity the value u i 1 at t t i 1 can be represented by its previous value u i at t t i as 1 u i 1 n 0 n t e d n u i d t n δ t n n where n t e represents the order of expansion when n t e 3 and 5 the third and fifth order taylor s expansions can be expressed as 2 u i 1 3 u i d u i d t δ t 1 2 d 2 u i d t 2 δ t 2 1 3 d 3 u i d t 3 δ t 3 3 u i 1 5 u i d u i d t δ t 1 2 d 2 u i d t 2 δ t 2 1 3 d 3 u i d t 3 δ t 3 1 4 d 4 u i d t 4 δ t 4 1 5 d 5 u i d t 5 δ t 5 where u i 1 3 and u i 1 5 are the third and fifth order taylor expansions respectively of u i at t t i 1 2 2 newmark β method the newmark β method is a numerical integration method in the time domain for dynamic response analysis huang et al 2019 in each time step based on the initial values of the forward step integration is used to determine the values at the next step at each time step δ t the acceleration u is assumed to change linearly as follows 4 u i 1 u i u i 1 u i δ t where δ t is the time step after obtaining the acceleration the velocity and displacement at each time step can be calculated as 5 u i 1 u i 0 δ t u τ d τ 6 u i 1 u i 0 δ t u τ d τ where u and u represent the displacement and velocity respectively in the newmark β method eqs 5 and 6 are expressed as 7 u i 1 u i u i δ t 1 2 β u i δ t 2 β u i 1 δ t 2 8 u i 1 u i 1 α u i δ t α u i 1 δ t where β and α are the increment factors of acceleration and velocity by selecting appropriate parameters each step can be approximated to accomplish a step by step analysis however the stability and accuracy of the newmark β method are closely related to the choice of parameters if the parameters are not selected properly the results may be inaccurate and unstable 3 dynamic response analysis based on taylor expansion taylor expansion which uses the information at one point to describe the value of its neighbouring points has been widely used in mathematics and physics because of its simplicity if taylor expansion can be used to calculate structural dynamic response the traditional time domain numerical methods can be simplified and a higher order accuracy can be achieved however two main problems arise in applying taylor expansion to this type of problem the first is how to calculate the high order derivatives of dynamic response components acceleration velocity and displacement the second is how to express an arbitrary external loading in a uniform and derivable form 3 1 taylor expansion of the equation of motion in dynamic response analysis of a multi degree of freedom mdof system under external loads the system is usually discretised into an n dof finite element model and can be expressed as 9 m x t c x t k x t f t where x t x t and x t are the acceleration velocity and displacement of the system respectively f t is the external loading and m c and k are the matrices of mass damping and stiffness respectively a step by step method can be used to obtain the solutions to eq 9 by introducing ϕ k x k t i k 0 1 2 n and the value of acceleration x t i 1 can be expressed by the value of acceleration x t i using taylor expansion as follows 10 x t i 1 ϕ 2 ϕ 3 δ t ϕ 4 2 δ t 2 ϕ n 2 n δ t n r 2 t i similarly the values of velocity and displacement can be expressed as 11 x t i 1 ϕ 1 ϕ 2 δ t ϕ 3 2 δ t 2 ϕ n 1 n δ t n r 1 t i 12 x t i 1 ϕ 0 ϕ 1 δ t ϕ 2 2 δ t 2 ϕ n n δ t n r 0 t i where r t i represents the remainder term through eqs 10 12 the equation of motion is expressed in a taylor expansion form of a step by step iterative solution the accuracy of eq 9 can be adjusted as needed by controlling the order of the taylor expansion 3 2 normalised expression of exciting loadings unlike the traditional newmark β method in which the velocity and displacement are calculated based on acceleration linearisation the method proposed in this paper performs high order taylor expansion on acceleration velocity and displacement respectively and the results are theoretically of higher accuracy using eqs 10 11 and 12 the components of motion at t t i 1 can be expressed by the values of responses at t t i the main problem is then how to calculate the high order derivative of the response at t t i the n th derivative of the system s equation of motion at t t i can be expressed as 13 m ϕ n 2 c ϕ n 1 k ϕ n f n t i from eq 13 we can see that the key challenge to obtaining the high order derivative of the response is to obtain the arbitrary order derivative of the external loading f n t i because the external loading in actual engineering problems is often truncated to a finite length and does not meet the periodicity assumption and because some noise signals may even be attenuated it is difficult to satisfy the assumptions required to perform a discrete fourier transform therefore the prony series is introduced in the proposed method to fit the external loading so that a finite length and non periodic loading f t can be decomposed into a superposition of several complex exponential signals as follows liu et al 2020b 14 f t p 1 n p γ p e λ p t p 1 n p a p e j ϑ p e ξ p j 2 π f p t where n p is the number of terms a p is the amplitude ϑ p is the initial phase ξ p is the damping factor f p is the frequency in hz and j 1 let the time interval be δ t then t i i δ t and f i f t i where i 0 1 n 1 and n is the number of points for a discrete loading 15 f t i p 1 n p γ p e λ p i δ t in eq 15 the exponential functions e λ p i δ t form a basis on the open interval 0 t t the prony series eq 15 can be regarded as the general solution of a p th order differential equation with coefficients b p 16 p 0 n p b p f i p 0 the characteristic polynomial of eq 16 is 17 p 0 n p b p z p 0 where z p e λ p i δ t the root of eq 17 is the complex exponent λ p in the complex exponent series of eq 14 3 3 estimation of complex exponent series the most commonly used method for decomposing an arbitrary loading into a complex exponential series is the prony method prony 1795 however the solution of polynomial equations in the prony method often leads to ill conditioned problems and will make the results sensitive to noise which limits its application in engineering practice therefore a low order state space model is introduced as liu et al 2019a 18 x 1 f 0 x 2 f 1 x n p f n p 1 and assuming b n p 1 eq 16 can be converted into a first order matrix differential equation as 19 x t ϝ x t where 20 x t d x t d t 21 ϝ 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 b 0 b 1 b 2 b 3 b n p 2 b n p 1 r n p n p and 22 x t x 1 x 2 x n p r n p then the eigenvalue analysis is performed on matrix ϝ and then a hankel matrix is introduced as follows 23 h i f i f i 1 f i η 1 f i 1 f i 2 f i η f i ξ 1 f i ξ f i η ξ 2 r ξ η then letting i 0 and i 1 a realisation of system of the matrix is achieved as 24 a s 1 1 2 u 1 t h 1 v 1 s 1 1 2 finally the λ p can be calculated by using the eigenvalues of a as λ p l n z p δ t and corresponding γ p can also be obtained 3 4 time domain response estimation after all of the γ p and λ p are estimated the external loading can be expressed by eq 14 and its n th derivative can be expressed as 25 f n t i p 1 n p λ p n γ p e λ p i δ t substituting eq 25 into eq 13 the derivative of arbitrary order of motion at t t i can be calculated as 26 ϕ n 2 m 1 p 1 n p λ p n γ p e λ p i δ t c ϕ n 1 k ϕ n 27 ϕ n 1 m 1 p 1 n p λ p n 1 γ p e λ p i δ t c ϕ n k ϕ n 1 28 ϕ 3 m 1 p 1 n p λ p γ p e λ p i δ t c ϕ 2 k ϕ 1 where ϕ 2 x t i and ϕ 1 x t i are corresponding to the values of acceleration and velocity at t t i the equation of motion can then be estimated based on the initial conditions 4 example 1 an sdof system subjected to harmonic excitation in the first example an sdof system under harmonic excitation is used to demonstrate its performance the results obtained are compared with the analytical results and those obtained with the traditional newmark β method the equation of motion of an sdof system can be written in the form of eq 9 as 29 m x t c x t k x t f t where m 2 c 4 and k 10 in this example the harmonic loading f t is simulated using a cosine function with an amplitude of 10 a frequency of 2 hz and a phase of π 6 shown as a blue line in fig 1 a when the proposed method is used the first step is to fit the external loading using eq 14 by decomposition the parameters of λ p can be calculated as λ 1 2 0 0000 12 5664 i substituting λ p into eq 14 the corresponding γ p can be estimated as γ 1 2 4 3301 2 5000 i based on the estimated γ p and λ p the external loading can be reconstructed and is shown as a red line in fig 1 a fig 1 b shows the absolute values of the relative errors between the original input and the reconstructed input comparing the blue line and the red line it can be seen that the reconstructed signal is consistent with the sampled input which indicates that the estimated γ p and λ p represent the original loading 4 1 response estimation by the proposed method in the time domain method the response is calculated for each time step and the values at the next time step are estimated based on the values at the previous time step we first compare the results for acceleration from newmark β method and the taylor expansion based methods within one time step in performing a comparative analysis within one time step we can consider two cases one in which the initial values are the same and another in which they are different we choose to compare the first point to the second point and the second point to the third point which corresponds to the consideration of the two cases to make the comparison more obvious the time interval δ t is set to be 0 1 s fig 2 a shows the results for acceleration of the system for the first time step because the initial conditions are same the results for all methods begin from the same starting point the red line shows the analytical results and the blue line shows the results obtained by the newmark β method because of the assumption of linear acceleration in the newmark β method there are errors in the calculation results however using the taylor expansion based methods as the order increases the error decreases and the results gradually approach the analytical results fig 2 b illustrates the results for the second time step because of the calculation error in the previous step the error associate with the newmark β method increases further and the taylor expansion based methods yield more accurate results because of the sensitivity to the choice of time interval when using the newmark β method in analysing the dynamic response of the sdof the time interval δ t was set to 0 05 s fig 3 illustrate the accelerations velocities and displacements by the traditional newmark β method and the taylor expansion based methods the red line shows the analytical results which can be used to compare the accuracy of the methods fig 3 shows that the dynamic responses obtained using the taylor expansion based methods are in good agreement with the analytical results which verifies the correctness of the proposed method at the same time it can be seen that even when the time interval is 0 05 s the results obtained by newmark β method still have a large error in comparison to the analytical results which is most obvious in fig 3 c in addition in fig 3 c we can see that the accuracy of the taylor expansion based methods can be improved by increasing the expansion order 4 2 investigation on the relative error with analytical results to assess the differences between the results obtained with the newmark β method and those obtained with the taylor expansion based methods fig 4 compares the absolute values of the relative errors between the newmark β results the third fourth fifth order taylor expansion based results and the analytical results when δ t 0 05 s it can be seen that even the error between the response obtained by the third order taylor expansion based method and the analytical result is smaller than that for the newmark β method for the same time interval as the order of the taylor expansion increases the relative error between the calculated results and the analytical results becomes smaller to compare the calculated results for different time intervals the newmark β method and the third order and fifth order taylor expansion methods were used with time intervals from 0 01 s to 0 1 s a correlation coefficient is introduced to compare the calculated results with the analytical results the correlation coefficient is defined as 30 ϱ x c a l x a n a c o v x c a l x a n a d x c a l d x a n a c o v x c a l x a n a σ x c a l σ x a n a where x a n a is the analytical result for displacement and x c a l represents the calculated results for displacement by the newmark β method the third and fifth order taylor expansion based methods respectively it can be seen in fig 5 that for the same time interval the methods based on taylor expansion are closer to the analytical results and that the higher the order of the taylor expansion is the more accurate the results obtained are at the same time even when the time interval is 0 001 s the results of the taylor expansion based methods approach the analytical results while the results of the newmark β method exhibit some differences from with the analytical results in actual measurement a fixed sampling frequency is often used when collecting signals and because of the equipment and other restrictions the sampling frequency usually cannot be set to such a high value therefore compared with the newmark β method the taylor expansion based methods have higher accuracy and better potential value in engineering applications 5 example 2 a 3dof system under earthquake excitation as shown in the first example the taylor expansion based methods can be extended to the third order fourth order and even higher orders and as the order of the taylor expansion increases the algorithm achieves higher accuracy in the second example only the third order taylor expansion based method is used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method in determining the dynamic response of a modf system under arbitrary loading a 3dof system is used and the matrices of mass stiffness and damping of this 3 dof system are given as clough and penzien 1993 31 m 1 0 0 0 1 5 0 0 0 2 32 k 600 1 1 0 1 3 2 0 2 5 33 c 2 094 0 990 0 0 990 4 626 1 980 0 1 980 7 157 to simulate an arbitrary loading we use the ei centro earthquake acceleration signal shown in fig 6 the selected signal is in the z direction with a sampling frequency 50 hz to simplify the calculation process the acceleration signal a e i for 5 s from 3 s to 8 s was used to study the feasibility of representing arbitrary loadings in the form of complex exponential functions to simulate the earthquake excitation m 1 a e i was used as the external loading of the system shown as the blue line in fig 7 a with the model order set to 2000 the red line illustrates the reconstructed loading and fig 7 b illustrates the relative error between the reconstructed loading and the original loading the magnitude of the relative error reaches 10 4 which demonstrates that the sum of complex exponential functions can represent the original loading however in the calculation the choice of the model order is not arbitrary and often requires multiple trials to determine in general the higher the model order is the higher the accuracy of the decomposition is without a loss of generality the initial conditions of the system for each degree of freedom were considered to be random for a time interval δ t 0 02 s the calculated displacement and velocity of the 3dof system are shown in figs 8 a and b respectively the green and red lines represent the calculated results obtained by the newmark β method and the third order taylor based method respectively it can be seen that there are some differences between the two sets of results to check the correctness of the two methods the lsim function in matlab was used to obtain the standard results shown by the blue lines in figs 8 a and b the results show that the responses obtained by the taylor expansion based method are in good agreement with the results obtained by lsim while the responses obtained by the newmark β method have some errors fig 9 shows the relative errors between the methods and the lsim function it can be seen that for a real signal with a certain sampling frequency even the third order taylor expansion based method achieves higher accuracy than the newmark β method 6 example 3 application to a monopile owt to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method for fixed offshore structure applications a 4 0 mw monopile owt is used in this example the total height of the structure is 110 m with 90 m above water and 20 m below water the diameters of the pile foundation and the top of the tower are 6 1 m and 3 7 m respectively the commercial finite element software ansys is used to establish a three dimensional finite element model of the monopile owt beam 188 element was selected for modelling the structure with a total of 66 elements and 396 degrees of freedom the finite element model of the monopile owt is illustrated in fig 10 when calculating the dynamic response of the owt it is first necessary to simulate the wave force acting on the structure the simulated waves are generated by the jonswap spectrum with a wave height of 5 m and wave period of 9 s first the generated wave are used to calculate the velocity and acceleration of wave points at each location and each time and with the added mass coefficient c m 1 0 and the drag coefficient c d 1 2 the morison formula is used to calculate the wave force acting on the structure then the wave force acted on each element below the water surface are integrated and equivalent to the nodes at both ends of each element so that the horizontal wave force and wave bending moment acted on each node can be calculated the calculated total wave force with 300 s in the time and frequency domains are shown in fig 11 and the third order taylor expansion based method is used to calculate the dynamic responses of the structure in the process of dynamic response analysis the external wave force should be decomposed first with the modal order set to 920 the decomposed complex exponential parameters of the wave force are used for calculating the structural dynamic response fig 12 shows the displacement response of the 73rd and 247th dof of the model which correspond to the x direction of the top of the foundation and the top of the tower respectively it can be seen that the calculated results of the proposed method and the predictions from the ansys software are consistent in the time domain which also verifies the feasibility of the proposed method for the calculation of dynamic responses of offshore structures 7 experimental data a cantilever beam in the third example a cantilever beam model with similar properties to the monopile offshore wind turbine zhou et al 2019 is used to verify the correctness of the proposed method the cantilever beam is a steel structure with an elastic modulus of 2 1 1 0 11 n m 2 and a density of 7850 kg m 3 the length of the beam is 1 89 m and the cross section of the beam is a rectangular 40 mm 20 mm in the analysis the beam was simplified to 12 elements and only 36 dofs of translational and rotational directions were considered fig 13 shows the layout of sensors on the beam in the experiment 10 acceleration sensors were installed and two displacement sensors were installed at the fifth and twelfth nodes to measure the responses of the cantilever beam the matrices of mass and stiffness were calculated by the finite element method the rayleigh damping model was used to estimate the damping matrix of the structure and the stochastic subspace identification ssi method was used to calculate the relevant parameters initial conditions such as initial displacements and initial velocities as well as external loadings can cause structural vibration to verify the correctness of the proposed method without lose of generality the initial conditions and external loadings are considered simultaneously the external loading acting on the ninth node of the beam was generated by the hydraulic shaker a steel frame was fixed to the shaker and a height adjustable support arm was used to transmit different types of external loadings to the beam a tension pressure sensor was installed on the support arm to collect information on the loadings the structural responses under sinusoidal excitation and random excitation were considered 7 1 case 1 dynamic response subject to sinusoidal excitation in this case the input loading was simulated by a sinusoidal signal first the ssi method was used to identify the modal parameters of the acceleration signals the first three orders of the frequencies were 5 2910 hz 26 5411 hz and 73 9950 hz substituting the identified modal parameters into the rayleigh damping model the corresponding parameters can be obtained where α 0 1446 and β 2 5907 1 0 5 through the relationship c α m β k the damping matrix of the cantilever beam model can be obtained a horizontal loading was applied at the twelfth node of the beam to deviate the beam from the equilibrium position and a horizontal initial displacement was generated the initial displacement at node 12 was measured by the displacement sensor to be 18 53 mm for a sampling frequency of 500 hz the recorded external loading acting on the ninth node and the measured displacements at fifth node and twelfth node are shown in figs 14 a b and c respectively the test is divided into two stages i e the pre test stage from 0 to 7 420 s and the formal test stage from 7 420 s to the end during the pre test stage the shaking table will automatically select best parameters for the formal test and then the preset accelerations will be imposed for the formal test the data from 7 420 s to 13 420 s were selected for analysis when using the taylor expansion based method to solve the dynamic response of the structure under external excitation the complex exponential decomposition of the external loading should be performed first for a real loading the modal order of the complex exponential decomposition is unknown so it is necessary to select an appropriate order to achieve high precision decomposition of the external loading by increasing the modal order the reconstructed loading after decomposition is shown by the red line in fig 15 it can be seen that the external loading is consistent with the reconstructed loading which also means that the reconstructed loading can represent the measured loading and can be used for subsequent dynamic response analysis by substituting the calculated parameters of the complex exponential functions and the initial displacements of each dof into the taylor expansion based method the dynamic response of the cantilever beam can be calculated figs 16 a and b show comparisons between the calculated displacements at fifth and twelfth nodes and the corresponding measured displacements it can be seen that the calculated results are nearly consistent with the measured values 7 2 case 2 dynamic response subject to random excitation real structures are often subjected to complex loadings in this second case random loadings were generated by the hydraulic shaker and the dynamic response of the cantilever beam under the initial conditions and random loadings was considered to simulate random loadings the jonswap spectrum with significant wave height of 6 m and spectral peak frequency of 5 3 hz was used to generate random accelerations and then the accelerations were input into the shaking table to generate random loadings during the working of the shaking table it will adaptively adjust itself according to the input spectrum and repeat output vibration and fig 17 shows the recorded random loading in the time and frequency domains the displacements in the y direction at the fifth and twelfth nodes are illustrated in fig 18 the time period from 7 920 s to 12 s was selected for the dynamic response analysis at the beginning of the vibration test the initial displacement in the y direction at node 12 was 21 1 mm the modal parameter identification of the acceleration signal under this condition was performed by the ssi method the first three orders frequencies of the beam were 5 2845 hz 26 5400 hz and 79 9943 hz the modal parameters identified were substituted into the rayleigh damping model and the corresponding parameter values were calculated as α 0 1087 and β 1 9434 1 0 5 then the damping matrix of the cantilever beam model was obtained from c α m β k complex exponential decomposition of the selected external loading was performed and the parameters λ p and γ p of the complex exponential functions were employed in the dynamic response analysis the calculated displacements at fifth and twelfth nodes are shown by the red lines in fig 19 the measured displacements are shown as the blue lines it can be seen that the two sets of results match well this comparison further verifies the correctness of the taylor expansion based methods 8 conclusions a new high order time domain dynamic response analysis method based on the normalised expression of external loadings is proposed for fixed offshore structures the proposed method uses complex exponential functions to fit an external loading so that the high order derivatives of the external loading can be obtained taylor expansion can be used to analyse the dynamic response of the structure the proposed method is a step by step method in the time domain but high order accuracy of the equation of motion can be obtained using the taylor expansion method in addition because of the utilisation of the low order state space model in the decomposition a high precision decomposition of the external loading can be achieved the conclusion can be drawn that the sum of complex exponential functions can represent the external loading well and that an arbitrary order derivative of the external loading can be obtained fig 7 for example shows the decomposed result for the ei centro earthquake excitation in the sdof numerical case the third fourth and fifth order taylor expansion based methods were used and the results were compared with the analytical results and the results obtained by the newmark β method it can be seen that as the order increases the accuracy of the proposed method increases and even the accuracy of the third order taylor expansion based method is higher than that of the newmark β method as shown in figs 4 and 5 it also can be seen that the sensitivity of the proposed method to the sampling frequency is lower than the newmark β method the numerical case of the 3dof system shows that even the third order taylor expansion based method has higher accuracy than the traditional method for a given sampling frequency finally the results from a numerical monopile owt and an experiment on a cantilever beam under harmonic and random excitations demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to effectively analyse structural dynamic responses however it should be noted that the results obtained by the proposed method are heavily dependent on the accuracy of the decomposition results if the parameters in the complex exponential functions are not sufficiently precise the results of the dynamic response analysis will exhibit large errors therefore when applying the taylor expansion based method to real engineering problems it is usually necessary to choose a high order to ensure the accuracy of the results possible methods for addressing this problem include continuing to decompose the remaining signals and interpolating external loadings so that the order of the decomposition can be increased credit authorship contribution statement shujian gao methodology formal analysis writing original draft writing review editing

21275,a new step by step dynamic response analysis method is proposed for fixed offshore structures in the time domain with high order accuracy the basic principle of the proposed method is to normalise an arbitrary loading into the form of complex exponents with arbitrary order derivatives permitting the high order taylor expansion of dynamic response components acceleration velocity and displacement in theory the proposed method is more accurate than other proposed methods especially for structures subjected to short term high energy loading with data collected using a limited sampling frequency the response obtained has higher order accuracy than that obtained with the widely used newmark β method which only has second order accuracy because of the assumption of acceleration linearisation four examples are used to demonstrate the correctness and accuracy of the proposed method the first numerical example uses a single degree of freedom sdof system to demonstrate the calculated results obtained using different orders of taylor expansion with the proposed method the comparison with the analytical result and the result obtained with the newmark β method shows that the proposed method is less sensitive to the sampling frequency and that even the accuracy of the third order taylor expansion based method is higher than that of the newmark β method in the second example the third order taylor expansion based method is used to calculate the dynamic response of a three degree of freedom 3dof system under earthquake excitation sampled at a fixed frequency to show that the proposed method can determine the structural dynamic response under an arbitrary form of loading better accuracy than the newmark β method in the third example a numerical monopile offshore wind turbine owt is used for verifying the feasibility of the proposed method in calculating the dynamic response of fixed offshore structures finally measurements of a cantilever beam with similar properties of monopile owt under harmonic excitations and random excitations are used to demonstrate the proposed method and illustrate its potential values for application to dynamic response analysis of fixed offshore structures keywords dynamic response fixed offshore structures high order accuracy taylor expansion complex exponential decomposition newmark β method 1 introduction to ensure the safe operation of fixed offshore structures during their service life such as fixed offshore platforms and monopile offshore wind turbines owts the structural design is developed from the simple strength design stage to the reliability design stage the process of structural dynamic design is no longer a simple process of calculation of structural dynamic characteristics but rather has gradually developed into the process of dynamic response analysis of an entire structure traditional structural dynamic response analysis methods are mainly divided into frequency and time domain methods wei et al 2018 frequency domain methods are fast and simple to solve but they are limited in application to linear time invariant systems that is to systems in which the geometric and physical parameters of structures are linear and do not change with time and for which the external loading is linear although some weakly nonlinear system can be solved in the frequency domain for most dynamic analysis problems in nonlinear systems the frequency domain methods are still not applicable and only step by step time domain methods can be used liu et al 2017 with the development of computer technology and numerical calculation methods time domain methods have become indispensable for structural design and analysis most time domain methods such as the newmark β method jin and gou 2018 the wilson θ method yang and wang 2008 and the central difference method yankovskii 2017 describe problems of structural dynamic response analysis in terms of second order differential equations and use step by step integration to obtain the solution however these methods are all linear methods that can only achieve second order accuracy in ensuring unconditional stability wang et al 2017 a method that can achieve higher order accuracy can provide more accurate results and is more conducive to long term prediction of structural response which is very important for structural dynamic design and analysis fung 1997 to obtain a high order solution of the equation of motion borri and borrasso 1993 introduced a discontinuous galerkin function and obtained a series of high order algorithms although the series of high order algorithms proved to be unconditionally stable cusps cannot be avoided in the spectral radii diagram and the results of response in the mid frequency range will have more algorithmic damping based on the newmark β method austin 1993 used the romberg extrapolation method to perform calculations in each time step and the results were evaluated several times over different lengths of steps to improve the accuracy of the results although the numerical results obtained show that application of the newmark method using the romberg extrapolation achieve high accuracy minor time steps are needed to maintain numerical stability the taylor expansion method is easy to implement and has been widely used in various fields taylor expansion splits a complex function into simple polynomials which does not simplify the process of solving the original complex function but does permit selection of an appropriate expansion order to satisfy the calculation accuracy requirements and reduce the complexity of the calculation chen et al 2015 at present the taylor expansion has been widely applied in structural analysis duan et al 2020 farahani and bahai 2004 proposed a first order inverse strategy for relocation of natural frequencies by performing a sensitivity analysis of structural eigenvalues with respect to material or geometric parameters and then calculated the parameter variation to achieve a desired frequency shift using the taylor expansion method to extend the proposed first order method to the second order these formulas have been proven to be very general and applicable to all finite element structures wang and yuan 2017 applied taylor expansion to eliminate virtual nodes outside the physical domain and overcome the problems encountered in high order frequency analysis a comparison of the results and the exact solutions showed that using the taylor expansion method to solve the boundary conditions produced a universal and accurate solution that was unaffected by the boundary conditions li et al 2017 used the taylor expansion method to extend the first order partial derivatives of eigenvalues to the second order and then model problems of structural eigenvalues with interval parameters as quadratic programming series with box constraints qb overcoming the problem of the first order method not being applicable to structural eigenvalues with interval parameters however when using taylor expansion to solve the second order differential equation of motion it is difficult to obtain the high order derivatives of the external loading because of its unknown form and this problem limits the applicability of taylor expansion in dynamic response analysis therefore if an arbitrary external loading can be decomposed as a set of functions that have high order derivation taylor expansion can be introduced to solve the equation of motion traditional decomposition methods are mainly divided into fourier based and empirical methods fourier based methods such as fourier decomposition and wavelet decomposition zhang and cheng 2016 are based on the assumption of periodicity when dealing with complex excitations the decomposed results often cannot achieve the required precision empirical methods have been widely used for the decomposition of complex nonlinear signals as empirical mode decomposition huang et al 1998 and ensemble empirical mode decomposition wu and huang 2009 however empirical methods cannot obtain the expression of functions tai et al 2019 prony s method uses complex exponential functions to represent signals which makes it possible to avoid the assumption of periodicity prony 1795 however when using the traditional prony method the calculation of the polynomials is an ill conditioned problem and round off errors exist for the linear prediction parameters consequently the prony method is sensitive to noise and is difficult to be applied in engineering practice in 2013 hu et al 2013 introduced a low order state space model based on prony s method called prony ss to transform the high order differential equation into a first order differential equation and overcome the ill conditioned problem of the traditional prony method liu et al 2020a this approach achieves a high accuracy decomposition and expression of complex signals in arbitrary form as a sum of complex exponential functions the prony ss method has been widely used in offshore structures and has shown good performance liu et al 2018 2019b tian et al 2020 based on a normalised expression of arbitrary loading a new dynamic response analysis method for fixed offshore structures is proposed in this paper the proposed method can achieve solutions with higher order accuracy than methods based on traditional second order differential equations essentially the novelty of the proposed method is to obtain the derivative of the external loading and employ taylor expansion in the dynamic response analysis four examples are presented in this paper to illustrate this proposed method first a single degree of freedom sdof system is used for comparison of analytical results results obtained with the newmark β method and results obtained with third fourth and fifth order taylor expansions second a three degree of freedom 3dof system under earthquake excitation and a numerical monopile owt under wave forces are used to demonstrate the correctness of the structural dynamic response obtained using the proposed method under arbitrary loadings finally data from an experiment involving a cantilever beam under harmonic excitations and random excitations are used to demonstrate a practical application of the proposed method 2 preliminaries 2 1 taylor expansion the taylor expansion has been widely used because of its simplicity the value u i 1 at t t i 1 can be represented by its previous value u i at t t i as 1 u i 1 n 0 n t e d n u i d t n δ t n n where n t e represents the order of expansion when n t e 3 and 5 the third and fifth order taylor s expansions can be expressed as 2 u i 1 3 u i d u i d t δ t 1 2 d 2 u i d t 2 δ t 2 1 3 d 3 u i d t 3 δ t 3 3 u i 1 5 u i d u i d t δ t 1 2 d 2 u i d t 2 δ t 2 1 3 d 3 u i d t 3 δ t 3 1 4 d 4 u i d t 4 δ t 4 1 5 d 5 u i d t 5 δ t 5 where u i 1 3 and u i 1 5 are the third and fifth order taylor expansions respectively of u i at t t i 1 2 2 newmark β method the newmark β method is a numerical integration method in the time domain for dynamic response analysis huang et al 2019 in each time step based on the initial values of the forward step integration is used to determine the values at the next step at each time step δ t the acceleration u is assumed to change linearly as follows 4 u i 1 u i u i 1 u i δ t where δ t is the time step after obtaining the acceleration the velocity and displacement at each time step can be calculated as 5 u i 1 u i 0 δ t u τ d τ 6 u i 1 u i 0 δ t u τ d τ where u and u represent the displacement and velocity respectively in the newmark β method eqs 5 and 6 are expressed as 7 u i 1 u i u i δ t 1 2 β u i δ t 2 β u i 1 δ t 2 8 u i 1 u i 1 α u i δ t α u i 1 δ t where β and α are the increment factors of acceleration and velocity by selecting appropriate parameters each step can be approximated to accomplish a step by step analysis however the stability and accuracy of the newmark β method are closely related to the choice of parameters if the parameters are not selected properly the results may be inaccurate and unstable 3 dynamic response analysis based on taylor expansion taylor expansion which uses the information at one point to describe the value of its neighbouring points has been widely used in mathematics and physics because of its simplicity if taylor expansion can be used to calculate structural dynamic response the traditional time domain numerical methods can be simplified and a higher order accuracy can be achieved however two main problems arise in applying taylor expansion to this type of problem the first is how to calculate the high order derivatives of dynamic response components acceleration velocity and displacement the second is how to express an arbitrary external loading in a uniform and derivable form 3 1 taylor expansion of the equation of motion in dynamic response analysis of a multi degree of freedom mdof system under external loads the system is usually discretised into an n dof finite element model and can be expressed as 9 m x t c x t k x t f t where x t x t and x t are the acceleration velocity and displacement of the system respectively f t is the external loading and m c and k are the matrices of mass damping and stiffness respectively a step by step method can be used to obtain the solutions to eq 9 by introducing ϕ k x k t i k 0 1 2 n and the value of acceleration x t i 1 can be expressed by the value of acceleration x t i using taylor expansion as follows 10 x t i 1 ϕ 2 ϕ 3 δ t ϕ 4 2 δ t 2 ϕ n 2 n δ t n r 2 t i similarly the values of velocity and displacement can be expressed as 11 x t i 1 ϕ 1 ϕ 2 δ t ϕ 3 2 δ t 2 ϕ n 1 n δ t n r 1 t i 12 x t i 1 ϕ 0 ϕ 1 δ t ϕ 2 2 δ t 2 ϕ n n δ t n r 0 t i where r t i represents the remainder term through eqs 10 12 the equation of motion is expressed in a taylor expansion form of a step by step iterative solution the accuracy of eq 9 can be adjusted as needed by controlling the order of the taylor expansion 3 2 normalised expression of exciting loadings unlike the traditional newmark β method in which the velocity and displacement are calculated based on acceleration linearisation the method proposed in this paper performs high order taylor expansion on acceleration velocity and displacement respectively and the results are theoretically of higher accuracy using eqs 10 11 and 12 the components of motion at t t i 1 can be expressed by the values of responses at t t i the main problem is then how to calculate the high order derivative of the response at t t i the n th derivative of the system s equation of motion at t t i can be expressed as 13 m ϕ n 2 c ϕ n 1 k ϕ n f n t i from eq 13 we can see that the key challenge to obtaining the high order derivative of the response is to obtain the arbitrary order derivative of the external loading f n t i because the external loading in actual engineering problems is often truncated to a finite length and does not meet the periodicity assumption and because some noise signals may even be attenuated it is difficult to satisfy the assumptions required to perform a discrete fourier transform therefore the prony series is introduced in the proposed method to fit the external loading so that a finite length and non periodic loading f t can be decomposed into a superposition of several complex exponential signals as follows liu et al 2020b 14 f t p 1 n p γ p e λ p t p 1 n p a p e j ϑ p e ξ p j 2 π f p t where n p is the number of terms a p is the amplitude ϑ p is the initial phase ξ p is the damping factor f p is the frequency in hz and j 1 let the time interval be δ t then t i i δ t and f i f t i where i 0 1 n 1 and n is the number of points for a discrete loading 15 f t i p 1 n p γ p e λ p i δ t in eq 15 the exponential functions e λ p i δ t form a basis on the open interval 0 t t the prony series eq 15 can be regarded as the general solution of a p th order differential equation with coefficients b p 16 p 0 n p b p f i p 0 the characteristic polynomial of eq 16 is 17 p 0 n p b p z p 0 where z p e λ p i δ t the root of eq 17 is the complex exponent λ p in the complex exponent series of eq 14 3 3 estimation of complex exponent series the most commonly used method for decomposing an arbitrary loading into a complex exponential series is the prony method prony 1795 however the solution of polynomial equations in the prony method often leads to ill conditioned problems and will make the results sensitive to noise which limits its application in engineering practice therefore a low order state space model is introduced as liu et al 2019a 18 x 1 f 0 x 2 f 1 x n p f n p 1 and assuming b n p 1 eq 16 can be converted into a first order matrix differential equation as 19 x t ϝ x t where 20 x t d x t d t 21 ϝ 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 b 0 b 1 b 2 b 3 b n p 2 b n p 1 r n p n p and 22 x t x 1 x 2 x n p r n p then the eigenvalue analysis is performed on matrix ϝ and then a hankel matrix is introduced as follows 23 h i f i f i 1 f i η 1 f i 1 f i 2 f i η f i ξ 1 f i ξ f i η ξ 2 r ξ η then letting i 0 and i 1 a realisation of system of the matrix is achieved as 24 a s 1 1 2 u 1 t h 1 v 1 s 1 1 2 finally the λ p can be calculated by using the eigenvalues of a as λ p l n z p δ t and corresponding γ p can also be obtained 3 4 time domain response estimation after all of the γ p and λ p are estimated the external loading can be expressed by eq 14 and its n th derivative can be expressed as 25 f n t i p 1 n p λ p n γ p e λ p i δ t substituting eq 25 into eq 13 the derivative of arbitrary order of motion at t t i can be calculated as 26 ϕ n 2 m 1 p 1 n p λ p n γ p e λ p i δ t c ϕ n 1 k ϕ n 27 ϕ n 1 m 1 p 1 n p λ p n 1 γ p e λ p i δ t c ϕ n k ϕ n 1 28 ϕ 3 m 1 p 1 n p λ p γ p e λ p i δ t c ϕ 2 k ϕ 1 where ϕ 2 x t i and ϕ 1 x t i are corresponding to the values of acceleration and velocity at t t i the equation of motion can then be estimated based on the initial conditions 4 example 1 an sdof system subjected to harmonic excitation in the first example an sdof system under harmonic excitation is used to demonstrate its performance the results obtained are compared with the analytical results and those obtained with the traditional newmark β method the equation of motion of an sdof system can be written in the form of eq 9 as 29 m x t c x t k x t f t where m 2 c 4 and k 10 in this example the harmonic loading f t is simulated using a cosine function with an amplitude of 10 a frequency of 2 hz and a phase of π 6 shown as a blue line in fig 1 a when the proposed method is used the first step is to fit the external loading using eq 14 by decomposition the parameters of λ p can be calculated as λ 1 2 0 0000 12 5664 i substituting λ p into eq 14 the corresponding γ p can be estimated as γ 1 2 4 3301 2 5000 i based on the estimated γ p and λ p the external loading can be reconstructed and is shown as a red line in fig 1 a fig 1 b shows the absolute values of the relative errors between the original input and the reconstructed input comparing the blue line and the red line it can be seen that the reconstructed signal is consistent with the sampled input which indicates that the estimated γ p and λ p represent the original loading 4 1 response estimation by the proposed method in the time domain method the response is calculated for each time step and the values at the next time step are estimated based on the values at the previous time step we first compare the results for acceleration from newmark β method and the taylor expansion based methods within one time step in performing a comparative analysis within one time step we can consider two cases one in which the initial values are the same and another in which they are different we choose to compare the first point to the second point and the second point to the third point which corresponds to the consideration of the two cases to make the comparison more obvious the time interval δ t is set to be 0 1 s fig 2 a shows the results for acceleration of the system for the first time step because the initial conditions are same the results for all methods begin from the same starting point the red line shows the analytical results and the blue line shows the results obtained by the newmark β method because of the assumption of linear acceleration in the newmark β method there are errors in the calculation results however using the taylor expansion based methods as the order increases the error decreases and the results gradually approach the analytical results fig 2 b illustrates the results for the second time step because of the calculation error in the previous step the error associate with the newmark β method increases further and the taylor expansion based methods yield more accurate results because of the sensitivity to the choice of time interval when using the newmark β method in analysing the dynamic response of the sdof the time interval δ t was set to 0 05 s fig 3 illustrate the accelerations velocities and displacements by the traditional newmark β method and the taylor expansion based methods the red line shows the analytical results which can be used to compare the accuracy of the methods fig 3 shows that the dynamic responses obtained using the taylor expansion based methods are in good agreement with the analytical results which verifies the correctness of the proposed method at the same time it can be seen that even when the time interval is 0 05 s the results obtained by newmark β method still have a large error in comparison to the analytical results which is most obvious in fig 3 c in addition in fig 3 c we can see that the accuracy of the taylor expansion based methods can be improved by increasing the expansion order 4 2 investigation on the relative error with analytical results to assess the differences between the results obtained with the newmark β method and those obtained with the taylor expansion based methods fig 4 compares the absolute values of the relative errors between the newmark β results the third fourth fifth order taylor expansion based results and the analytical results when δ t 0 05 s it can be seen that even the error between the response obtained by the third order taylor expansion based method and the analytical result is smaller than that for the newmark β method for the same time interval as the order of the taylor expansion increases the relative error between the calculated results and the analytical results becomes smaller to compare the calculated results for different time intervals the newmark β method and the third order and fifth order taylor expansion methods were used with time intervals from 0 01 s to 0 1 s a correlation coefficient is introduced to compare the calculated results with the analytical results the correlation coefficient is defined as 30 ϱ x c a l x a n a c o v x c a l x a n a d x c a l d x a n a c o v x c a l x a n a σ x c a l σ x a n a where x a n a is the analytical result for displacement and x c a l represents the calculated results for displacement by the newmark β method the third and fifth order taylor expansion based methods respectively it can be seen in fig 5 that for the same time interval the methods based on taylor expansion are closer to the analytical results and that the higher the order of the taylor expansion is the more accurate the results obtained are at the same time even when the time interval is 0 001 s the results of the taylor expansion based methods approach the analytical results while the results of the newmark β method exhibit some differences from with the analytical results in actual measurement a fixed sampling frequency is often used when collecting signals and because of the equipment and other restrictions the sampling frequency usually cannot be set to such a high value therefore compared with the newmark β method the taylor expansion based methods have higher accuracy and better potential value in engineering applications 5 example 2 a 3dof system under earthquake excitation as shown in the first example the taylor expansion based methods can be extended to the third order fourth order and even higher orders and as the order of the taylor expansion increases the algorithm achieves higher accuracy in the second example only the third order taylor expansion based method is used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method in determining the dynamic response of a modf system under arbitrary loading a 3dof system is used and the matrices of mass stiffness and damping of this 3 dof system are given as clough and penzien 1993 31 m 1 0 0 0 1 5 0 0 0 2 32 k 600 1 1 0 1 3 2 0 2 5 33 c 2 094 0 990 0 0 990 4 626 1 980 0 1 980 7 157 to simulate an arbitrary loading we use the ei centro earthquake acceleration signal shown in fig 6 the selected signal is in the z direction with a sampling frequency 50 hz to simplify the calculation process the acceleration signal a e i for 5 s from 3 s to 8 s was used to study the feasibility of representing arbitrary loadings in the form of complex exponential functions to simulate the earthquake excitation m 1 a e i was used as the external loading of the system shown as the blue line in fig 7 a with the model order set to 2000 the red line illustrates the reconstructed loading and fig 7 b illustrates the relative error between the reconstructed loading and the original loading the magnitude of the relative error reaches 10 4 which demonstrates that the sum of complex exponential functions can represent the original loading however in the calculation the choice of the model order is not arbitrary and often requires multiple trials to determine in general the higher the model order is the higher the accuracy of the decomposition is without a loss of generality the initial conditions of the system for each degree of freedom were considered to be random for a time interval δ t 0 02 s the calculated displacement and velocity of the 3dof system are shown in figs 8 a and b respectively the green and red lines represent the calculated results obtained by the newmark β method and the third order taylor based method respectively it can be seen that there are some differences between the two sets of results to check the correctness of the two methods the lsim function in matlab was used to obtain the standard results shown by the blue lines in figs 8 a and b the results show that the responses obtained by the taylor expansion based method are in good agreement with the results obtained by lsim while the responses obtained by the newmark β method have some errors fig 9 shows the relative errors between the methods and the lsim function it can be seen that for a real signal with a certain sampling frequency even the third order taylor expansion based method achieves higher accuracy than the newmark β method 6 example 3 application to a monopile owt to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method for fixed offshore structure applications a 4 0 mw monopile owt is used in this example the total height of the structure is 110 m with 90 m above water and 20 m below water the diameters of the pile foundation and the top of the tower are 6 1 m and 3 7 m respectively the commercial finite element software ansys is used to establish a three dimensional finite element model of the monopile owt beam 188 element was selected for modelling the structure with a total of 66 elements and 396 degrees of freedom the finite element model of the monopile owt is illustrated in fig 10 when calculating the dynamic response of the owt it is first necessary to simulate the wave force acting on the structure the simulated waves are generated by the jonswap spectrum with a wave height of 5 m and wave period of 9 s first the generated wave are used to calculate the velocity and acceleration of wave points at each location and each time and with the added mass coefficient c m 1 0 and the drag coefficient c d 1 2 the morison formula is used to calculate the wave force acting on the structure then the wave force acted on each element below the water surface are integrated and equivalent to the nodes at both ends of each element so that the horizontal wave force and wave bending moment acted on each node can be calculated the calculated total wave force with 300 s in the time and frequency domains are shown in fig 11 and the third order taylor expansion based method is used to calculate the dynamic responses of the structure in the process of dynamic response analysis the external wave force should be decomposed first with the modal order set to 920 the decomposed complex exponential parameters of the wave force are used for calculating the structural dynamic response fig 12 shows the displacement response of the 73rd and 247th dof of the model which correspond to the x direction of the top of the foundation and the top of the tower respectively it can be seen that the calculated results of the proposed method and the predictions from the ansys software are consistent in the time domain which also verifies the feasibility of the proposed method for the calculation of dynamic responses of offshore structures 7 experimental data a cantilever beam in the third example a cantilever beam model with similar properties to the monopile offshore wind turbine zhou et al 2019 is used to verify the correctness of the proposed method the cantilever beam is a steel structure with an elastic modulus of 2 1 1 0 11 n m 2 and a density of 7850 kg m 3 the length of the beam is 1 89 m and the cross section of the beam is a rectangular 40 mm 20 mm in the analysis the beam was simplified to 12 elements and only 36 dofs of translational and rotational directions were considered fig 13 shows the layout of sensors on the beam in the experiment 10 acceleration sensors were installed and two displacement sensors were installed at the fifth and twelfth nodes to measure the responses of the cantilever beam the matrices of mass and stiffness were calculated by the finite element method the rayleigh damping model was used to estimate the damping matrix of the structure and the stochastic subspace identification ssi method was used to calculate the relevant parameters initial conditions such as initial displacements and initial velocities as well as external loadings can cause structural vibration to verify the correctness of the proposed method without lose of generality the initial conditions and external loadings are considered simultaneously the external loading acting on the ninth node of the beam was generated by the hydraulic shaker a steel frame was fixed to the shaker and a height adjustable support arm was used to transmit different types of external loadings to the beam a tension pressure sensor was installed on the support arm to collect information on the loadings the structural responses under sinusoidal excitation and random excitation were considered 7 1 case 1 dynamic response subject to sinusoidal excitation in this case the input loading was simulated by a sinusoidal signal first the ssi method was used to identify the modal parameters of the acceleration signals the first three orders of the frequencies were 5 2910 hz 26 5411 hz and 73 9950 hz substituting the identified modal parameters into the rayleigh damping model the corresponding parameters can be obtained where α 0 1446 and β 2 5907 1 0 5 through the relationship c α m β k the damping matrix of the cantilever beam model can be obtained a horizontal loading was applied at the twelfth node of the beam to deviate the beam from the equilibrium position and a horizontal initial displacement was generated the initial displacement at node 12 was measured by the displacement sensor to be 18 53 mm for a sampling frequency of 500 hz the recorded external loading acting on the ninth node and the measured displacements at fifth node and twelfth node are shown in figs 14 a b and c respectively the test is divided into two stages i e the pre test stage from 0 to 7 420 s and the formal test stage from 7 420 s to the end during the pre test stage the shaking table will automatically select best parameters for the formal test and then the preset accelerations will be imposed for the formal test the data from 7 420 s to 13 420 s were selected for analysis when using the taylor expansion based method to solve the dynamic response of the structure under external excitation the complex exponential decomposition of the external loading should be performed first for a real loading the modal order of the complex exponential decomposition is unknown so it is necessary to select an appropriate order to achieve high precision decomposition of the external loading by increasing the modal order the reconstructed loading after decomposition is shown by the red line in fig 15 it can be seen that the external loading is consistent with the reconstructed loading which also means that the reconstructed loading can represent the measured loading and can be used for subsequent dynamic response analysis by substituting the calculated parameters of the complex exponential functions and the initial displacements of each dof into the taylor expansion based method the dynamic response of the cantilever beam can be calculated figs 16 a and b show comparisons between the calculated displacements at fifth and twelfth nodes and the corresponding measured displacements it can be seen that the calculated results are nearly consistent with the measured values 7 2 case 2 dynamic response subject to random excitation real structures are often subjected to complex loadings in this second case random loadings were generated by the hydraulic shaker and the dynamic response of the cantilever beam under the initial conditions and random loadings was considered to simulate random loadings the jonswap spectrum with significant wave height of 6 m and spectral peak frequency of 5 3 hz was used to generate random accelerations and then the accelerations were input into the shaking table to generate random loadings during the working of the shaking table it will adaptively adjust itself according to the input spectrum and repeat output vibration and fig 17 shows the recorded random loading in the time and frequency domains the displacements in the y direction at the fifth and twelfth nodes are illustrated in fig 18 the time period from 7 920 s to 12 s was selected for the dynamic response analysis at the beginning of the vibration test the initial displacement in the y direction at node 12 was 21 1 mm the modal parameter identification of the acceleration signal under this condition was performed by the ssi method the first three orders frequencies of the beam were 5 2845 hz 26 5400 hz and 79 9943 hz the modal parameters identified were substituted into the rayleigh damping model and the corresponding parameter values were calculated as α 0 1087 and β 1 9434 1 0 5 then the damping matrix of the cantilever beam model was obtained from c α m β k complex exponential decomposition of the selected external loading was performed and the parameters λ p and γ p of the complex exponential functions were employed in the dynamic response analysis the calculated displacements at fifth and twelfth nodes are shown by the red lines in fig 19 the measured displacements are shown as the blue lines it can be seen that the two sets of results match well this comparison further verifies the correctness of the taylor expansion based methods 8 conclusions a new high order time domain dynamic response analysis method based on the normalised expression of external loadings is proposed for fixed offshore structures the proposed method uses complex exponential functions to fit an external loading so that the high order derivatives of the external loading can be obtained taylor expansion can be used to analyse the dynamic response of the structure the proposed method is a step by step method in the time domain but high order accuracy of the equation of motion can be obtained using the taylor expansion method in addition because of the utilisation of the low order state space model in the decomposition a high precision decomposition of the external loading can be achieved the conclusion can be drawn that the sum of complex exponential functions can represent the external loading well and that an arbitrary order derivative of the external loading can be obtained fig 7 for example shows the decomposed result for the ei centro earthquake excitation in the sdof numerical case the third fourth and fifth order taylor expansion based methods were used and the results were compared with the analytical results and the results obtained by the newmark β method it can be seen that as the order increases the accuracy of the proposed method increases and even the accuracy of the third order taylor expansion based method is higher than that of the newmark β method as shown in figs 4 and 5 it also can be seen that the sensitivity of the proposed method to the sampling frequency is lower than the newmark β method the numerical case of the 3dof system shows that even the third order taylor expansion based method has higher accuracy than the traditional method for a given sampling frequency finally the results from a numerical monopile owt and an experiment on a cantilever beam under harmonic and random excitations demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to effectively analyse structural dynamic responses however it should be noted that the results obtained by the proposed method are heavily dependent on the accuracy of the decomposition results if the parameters in the complex exponential functions are not sufficiently precise the results of the dynamic response analysis will exhibit large errors therefore when applying the taylor expansion based method to real engineering problems it is usually necessary to choose a high order to ensure the accuracy of the results possible methods for addressing this problem include continuing to decompose the remaining signals and interpolating external loadings so that the order of the decomposition can be increased credit authorship contribution statement shujian gao methodology formal analysis writing original draft writing review editing

21276,this paper investigates the dynamic load characteristics of a near surface open propeller in regular head waves based on a model experiment in a circulating water channel with the aid of captured free surface profiles the influences of periodical variation of submergence depth and inflow velocity on the dynamic load characteristics are systematically investigated and the thrust hysteresis in periodical emergence condition is quantitatively evaluated as conclusions a critical instantaneous submergence depth is identified for this propeller in regular waves at a certain advance ratio above this value the dynamic load characteristics are not dominated by the propeller surface interactions for a periodically emerged propeller the influence of the periodical variation of inflow velocity on the dynamic load characteristics is more significant as either submergence depth or wave height increases with increasing wave period the wave caused load fluctuation amplitude increases in a more obvious manner in periodical emergence condition but decreases less obviously in full submergence condition regarding the thrust hysteresis it takes approximately 5 revolutions for this propeller in full submergence to regain full thrust lastly the thrust fluctuation and loss due to slipstream inclination is considered responsible for thrust hysteresis which happens as the previously emerged propeller heads into full submergence keywords dynamic load characteristics critical instantaneous submergence depth thrust hysteresis near surface open propeller regular head waves 1 introduction propeller thrust fluctuation is a serious problem constantly encountered by any vessels or dynamic position dp systems in rough seas for vessels thrust fluctuation occurs due to large amplitude pitching and heaving that give the propellers a highly unstable working environment with thrust fluctuation often comes abrupt thrust loss and consequently serious speed loss of the ship for dp systems damages on propeller shaft bearings and interior gears constantly happen due to thrust and torque fluctuation because the propellers constantly operate at high loadings to maintain certain position and heading leading to a high risk of ventilation therefore more knowledge is required on the underlying physics of the dynamic load characteristics of near surface propeller in waves in order to optimize operational strategies and reduce damages dynamic load characteristics of near surface propeller are basically the results of propeller surface interactions we have seen many studies concerning dynamic load characteristics and ventilation of near surface propellers in calm water over the years the early ones including kempf 1934 shiba 1953 and fleischer 1973 are all based on experimental methods earlier in this century koushan 2004 discussed multiple environmental and interaction effects on the thrust loss of thrusters such as out of water effect wagner effect wagner 1925 ventilation effect and thruster thruster interactions in addition koushan 2007 conducted model experiments to study the thrust loss of an open and a ducted propeller due to ventilation at bollard condition in part of the working conditions the two propellers were towed while experiencing forced sinusoidal heave motion ventilation was found as the primary cause of load fluctuations for a thruster undergoing forced heave motions kozlowska et al 2009 observed different ventilation inception mechanisms and analyzed the effect of advance ratio revolution rate submergence depth and time on ventilation inception and thrust loss the authors also found good agreement between experimental values of thrust loss and calculated values based on empirical equations another paper by kozlowska et al 2011 investigated near surface propeller thrust and torque fluctuation during non ventilating and ventilating phases based on numerical and experimental approaches califano et al 2011a focused on the thrust loss of a fully ventilated propeller at high loadings the cause of the deviation between the simulated and measured data was analyzed from the angle of surface tension time step under relaxation factors and so on another paper by califano et al 2011b identified different ventilation regimes through a series of open propeller model experiments at variant submergence depths by measuring dynamic loads and by capturing images of ventilation phenomena using an under water high speed camera the three different ventilation regimes identified are one free surface vortex at a deeper submergence featuring discontinuous thrust losses two tip vortex at a lower submergence featuring uniform thrust loss within a complete revolution and three intermediate in which both regimes free surface vortex and tip vortex act in alternation tokgoz et al 2014 investigated the flow around a near surface propeller at different submergence depths using a body force model that could successfully simulate the effect of free surface on the propeller adjacent flow characteristics paik et al 2008 studied the adjacent flow field characteristics of a near surface open propeller at variant submergence depths and loading conditions as the propeller approaches the free surface the acceleration of inflow velocity decreases so does the axial momentum from the propeller blade tip to the slipstream region paik 2017 numerically studied the hydrodynamic performance and the flow field of a propeller operating beneath the free surface various advance ratios and submergence depths were chosen for simulations considering both the ventilation effect and the out of water effect on the hydrodynamic performance of a near surface propeller in calm water kozlowska et al 2020 used a time domain model to calculate thrust loss and torque loss the calculation results were compared against experiments and cfd simulations and found to be have better agreement with cfd results than with experimental results as for the near surface open propeller in waves the two papers by nakamura and naito 1975 1979 were the first systematical experimental studies experiments were arranged with forced pitch and heave oscillation under variant wave frequencies and advance ratios the authors identified two components of propeller load fluctuations in waves namely the orbital velocity variation and submergence variation faltinsen et al 1981 investigated the ventilation effect on time average thrust and torque of propellers in waves and minsaas et al 1983 discussed the effect of periodic variations in propeller immersion on propulsive performance in head seas one of the most important findings of these two papers is the mathematical modelling of the time averaged propeller thrust loss as a function of the ratio between submergence depth and propeller radius several contributing factors of the thrust loss were considered in the modelling namely the loss of effective disk area the propeller wave making and the wagner effect wagner 1925 i e for an airfoil accelerating instantaneously from rest to a certain speed the build up of steady state lift is however a gradual process cao 1988 conducted experiments on the hydrodynamic performance of an open propeller with variant submergence depths in regular waves it was found that the difference between the time averaged hydrodynamic performance of propeller in calm water and waves is not obvious at a sufficiently large submergence depth but rather obvious if the submergence decreases politis 1999 performed open propeller tests in both regular and irregular waves with different submergence depths advance ratios and wave parameters it was found for a propeller deeply submerged in regular waves load variation is 180 out of phase with the water surface elevation for a propeller in irregular waves at low submergence load variation is dominated by ventilation while the averaged thrust can be described as a function of submergence to diameter ratio and significant wave height koushan et al 2009 conducted an experiment concerning the effect of regular waves and ventilation on the time averaged and dynamic load of an open propeller the author ascribes the dynamic load behaviors to the water surface elevation because the maximum and minimum thrust are identified respectively at wave crest and wave trough guo et al 2012 experimentally studied the time averaged and time dependent thrust and torque of a propeller in regular waves at variant submergence depths and advance speeds the authors noticed that the load variation period is coincident with wave period due to the existence of waves more recently several numerical studies have been published for example bondarenko and kashiwagi 2011 examined a mathematical model that connects the spectrum of incident waves and the variance of torque fluctuation of racing propeller and validated this model through a comparison with cfd results of propeller torque fluctuation at racing condition in irregular waves using a propeller body force model tokgoz et al 2017 et al investigated the dynamic loads of an mau series five bladed propeller and the kvlcc2 propeller in regular head waves the simulated thrust and torque time series were compared with the experimental ones by nakamura and naito 1979 and good agreement was found for conditions at lower loadings zhao et al 2017 did a comparison study on propeller dynamic loads at two different advance speeds using numerical and experimental methods it was concluded that the propeller propulsive efficiency in waves is not necessarily lower than in calm water based on both quasi steady and fully unsteady approaches saettone et al 2020 predicted the propeller hydrodynamic performance in the presence of waves under both open water and behind hull conditions the authors found good agreement between the two approaches in the prediction of unsteady propeller forces cavitation volume and hull pressure pulses which proves the validity of the quasi steady approach in computing propeller performance in waves the previous studies have yielded great achievements and given us abundant inspiration however investigations are inadequate regarding the physical mechanism of the dynamic load characteristics of propeller in waves only several previous studies e g nakamura and naito 1979 minsaas et al 1983 koushan et al 2009 tokgoz et al 2017 guo et al 2012 and zhao et al 2017 have given attention to the time dependent characteristics of thrust and torque in waves furthermore in order to gain more knowledge of the thrust hysteresis on a periodically emerging propeller in regular waves quantitative analysis should be conducted using experimental methods the thrust hysteresis or hysteresis effect is an important consideration factor for thrust estimation with ventilated propeller referring to the delay in thrust development during periodical emergence which is considered to be related to the wagner effect when an emerged propeller blade with typical design and typical pitch ratio heads into full submergence as inferred by koushan 2004 it takes approximately four revolutions to regain full thrust to our knowledge hysteresis effect was investigated by faltinsen et al 1981 and minsaas et al 1983 discussed by koushan 2004 and califano 2010 and considered by kozlowska et al 2009 in the calculations of thrust loss based on empirical equations however regarding an open propeller in regular waves no quantitative experimental evaluation of hysteresis effect have yet been conducted to sum up in this paper we present an experimental investigation conducted in a circulating water channel cwc primarily on the dynamic load characteristics as well as the thrust hysteresis of a near surface open propeller model in regular head waves the main works of this paper are summarized into four parts 1 first we investigated the time averaged propeller hydrodynamic performance in calm water at variant submergence depths and advance speeds then based on calm water results we predicted the propeller s time dependent thrust and torque in regular waves using a quasi steady method in order to provide a comparison with measured data in regular waves 2 for each test condition in waves we discussed the different influences of periodical variation of submergence depth and inflow velocity on the dynamic load characteristics with the help of free surface profiles captured by high resolution camera for a systematical research test conditions comprise variant submergence depths wave heights and wave periods 3 based on the discussions in 2 we identified a critical instantaneous submergence depth for this propeller model at a certain advance ratio above this instantaneous submergence depth the dynamic load is almost independent of the periodical variation of submergence depth but rather dominated by the periodical variation of inflow velocity 4 regarding the thrust hysteresis in regular waves we roughly estimated the number of revolutions in full submergence for the propeller to regain full thrust also we noticed a rather intense ventilation phenomenon with the captured free surface profiles which can also contribute to the hysteresis aside from the wagner effect 2 description of the experiment 2 1 propeller model a four bladed right handed mau series propeller is used for the experiment table 1 shows its main particulars 2 2 non dimensional coefficients and reference frame thrust coefficient and torque coefficient are defined as

in regular head waves the instantaneous advance speed v ains is roughly defined as 3 v a i n s v a v h where v h is the horizontal velocity of water particles at the propeller disk center 4 v h a ω sin k x ω t exp k z where a is wave amplitude ω is wave frequency k ω 2 g is wave number where g is gravitational acceleration z is the z coordinate of the propeller disk center as the z coordinate of

above the values of around 180 shiba 1953 in this experiment we is approximately 65 a cartesian reference frame o xyz is established in fig 1 the origin o is located at the intersection among the static water surface the vertical axis z and the left end of cwc test section figs 2 and 5 show sketches of cwc test section the x axis points towards the stern which is parallel with the propeller axis the y axis points towards the starboard direction z axis to the vertical direction 2 3 test conditions test conditions are summarized as table 2 where t represents regular wave period the wave steepness of each regular wave test condition is expressed in the form of ak as shown in table 3 which reveals the linearity of the generated waves 2 4 wave quality evaluation this experiment was conducted in the circulating water channel cwc laboratory of shanghai jiao tong university the cwc test section is 8 0 m long and 3 0 m wide the constant water depth is 1 6 m before the propeller loading experiment to evaluate the generated wave quality we measured the water surface elevation under two representative wave heights h 5 2 7 8 cm corresponding to whr 0 4 0 6 t 1 0408s and constant inflow velocity v a 0 312 m s corresponding to j 0 2 two monitoring points were chosen for this measurement fig 2 shows the general arrangement of wave quality evaluation the cwc test section is equipped with a flap type wave maker at the left end and a flow transparent type wave absorber at the right end as shown in fig 3 the open boat device is placed in the exact same location as in the propeller loading experiment in order to simulate the actual flow field environment we positioned one wave height meter whm 2 in the center of cwc test section x 4 m y 0 m the same position as the propeller model disk center in the propeller loading experiment the other wave height meter whm 1 is positioned 0 8 m upstream of whm 2 x 3 2 m y 0 m fig 4 a and b show the measured water surface elevation of the two wave conditions it can be observed that the measured wave height and wave period remain stable over time and there is hardly any discernible wave surface deformation for a quantified evaluation of the generated wave quality the following two tables tables 4 and 5 present the measured wave height h crest crest periods t crest crest and trough trough periods t trough trough in each wave cycle and averaged in 10 wave cycles at the propeller disk center for the two wave conditions and the relative error against the desired values note that the relative error corresponding to the average means the relative error of the averaged value against the desired value regarding the generated wave height for the two wave conditions the generated wave height has a slight difference than the desired value which is less than 5 for almost all wave cycles and around 2 2 1 and 1 9 for the averaged value in 10 wave cycles there does exist one oddly large wave height in the 6th wave cycle as shown in table 3 9 6 higher than the desired wave height but we consider this an occasional outlier also it can be observed that the wave amplitude varies with time but this variation is less than 2 the desired wave height in most wave cycles regarding the generated wave period for the two conditions the difference between the generated and desired value is even smaller than the difference in wave height for each wave cycle the relative error is no larger than 2 for the averaged value in 10 wave cycles the relative error is less than 0 5 to sum up we deem the generated waves are of satisfactory quality regarding both the accuracy of wave height and period 2 5 arrangement of propeller loading experiment fig 5 shows the general arrangement of the propeller loading experiment a dynamometer and an electric motor which are linked with each other are placed inside the open boat device and then linked to the propeller axis the propeller model is mounted on the propeller axis and located in the center of the cwc test section x 4 m y 0 m two wave height meters which are positioned symmetrically about the propeller axis are 2 m away from each other in y axis direction y 1 1 m y 2 1 m and 0 4 m upstream of the propeller model x 1 x 2 3 6 m the submergence depth of propeller model is adjusted by rotating the height regulator on top of the open boat device and the desired advance ratio is achieved by adjusting the set value of inflow velocity a high resolution video camera is located right near the side window of the cwc working section to capture the free surface profiles through the whole experiment the measured data in both calm water and regular wave test conditions are obtained over a time range of 30s the 30s time window ensures at least 20 wave cycles for regular wave test cases around 21 wave cycles for the largest wave period t 1 3768s and around 28 for the smallest wave period t 1 0408s and 360 propeller revolutions for calm water cases given that n 12r s the measured data i e the time series of thrust torque and water surface elevation are transmitted through the data line to the controlling computer aside the cwc test section sampling frequency of experiment data equals 100 hz fig 6 shows a photo taken by the video camera in the propeller loading experiment 3 uncertainty analysis ua 3 1 general ua methodology for propeller open water test the present uncertainty analysis is based on the ittc procedures and guidelines 7 5 02 03 02 2 ittc 2014 the measurement of uncertainty is indicated by the 95 confidence uncertainty u rss which is estimated with a root sum square rss as follows 14 u rss p r 2 b r 2 where p r b r represent the precision limit and bias limit respectively r j k t k q to estimate the bias limits b r we must first determine the bias limit b x of all individual variables x in this case x v a n d ρ t and q then calculate b r using the error propagation equation below 15 b r x θ x 2 b x 2 where θ x r x refers to the sensitivity coefficient of each b x the bias limits of n d ρ t and q were obtained following the procedure introduced in the ittc procedures and guidelines 7 5 02 03 02 2 the bias of inflow velocity v a in cwc b va referring to the discrepancy between the measured and the desired flow velocity which results from the flow velocity non uniformity in the cwc working section was determined using the method introduced herein first a pitot tube was installed at the center of the cwc working section i e 4 0 0 where the propeller disk center was located and the flow velocity fully developed then the pitot tube was moved along the y axis and z axis within the periphery of propeller radius to measure the local flow velocity v ameas i at n different locations on the propeller disk plane hence the bias limit b vameas due to flow velocity non uniformity can be calculated with the equation below 16 b v a meas 2 s e e 2 i 1 n v s e t v a m e a s i 2 n 2 in addition considering the error of the measurement with the pitot tube b vapito the total bias limit b va is written as 17 b v a b v a m e a s 2 b v a p i t o 2 the bias of submergence depth b l 0 0015 m referring to the error from measuring the submergence depth of the propeller axis with a ruler fixated on the open boat device b l consists of the reading error on the fixated ruler 0 001 m and an unquantifiable error between the propeller axis center at sdr 0 and the actual static water level the b l of 0 0015 m will cause a bias of 0 0115 on sdr b l d 0 0015m 0 13 m 0 0115 and on the critical instantaneous submergence depth which will be discussed in section 4 3 precision limits for multiple tests was obtained by multiple test measurements of thrust and torque which is given by the equation below 18 p r 2 s r m where s r represents the standard deviation of the measured values and m 12 is the number of repeats we selected the test condition of j 0 2 and sdr 0 5 in calm water for multiple test procedure 3 2 bias from error of propeller submergence depth an approximated formula proposed by minsaas et al 1983 is used to determine the mathematical relationship between submergence depth l and k t k q of near surface propeller in calm water as written in eq 19 this equation is an approximated expression of near surface propeller thrust loss as a function of submergence radius ratio according to kozlowska 2009 and califano 2010 this equation considers three contributing factors to thrust loss namely the loss of propeller effective disk area the wagner effect and the wave making by the propeller the thrust loss due to ventilation however is not considered 19 β k t n k t 1 0 675 1 0 769 l r p 1 258 l r p 1 3 where r p 0 065 m is propeller model radius β being the ratio between k tn k t at a certain l lower than 1 3 r j 0 2 and k t 0 2728 k t without considering the free surface at j 0 2 the mathematical relationship between k qn k q at a certain l lower than 1 3r p j 0 2 and l can be roughly determined by eq 20 20 k q n β m k q where m is a constant between 0 8 and 0 85 minsaas et al 1983 m 0 82 in this paper k q 0 0344 k q without considering the free surface at j 0 2 the contribution of errors in l to the bias of measured value of k t and k q can be derived 21 b k t n θ l k t b l k t n l b l b k q n θ l k q b l k q n l b l 3 3 results of ua table 6 shows all biases and sensitive coefficients according to table 7 the percentage of u rss to the average value of k t is higher than that of k q the contribution of precision limit p r of both k t and k q to u rss is less than 1 of the total uncertainty however the contribution of total bias limit of k t and k q to u rss is over 99 for j the bias of inflow velocity is the dominant bias while the contribution of bias of n and d is almost negligible also for k t k q although the primary bias is the thrust torque bias b t b q the bias of submergence depth b l is also quite important therefore for near surface propeller experiment ua must consider the bias of submergence depth 4 results and discussions 4 1 time averaged hydrodynamic performance in calm water before the regular wave propeller loading experiment we did some measurements of the time averaged k t and 10k q in calm water in order to validate our experimental results against calculated values based on eq 19 and results from naito and nakamura 1979 and to offer benchmark data for the quasi steady prediction method of propeller performance in regular waves section 4 2 1 tests were conducted at six sdrs 0 167 0 333 0 5 0 75 1 0 and 1 5 in the range of j 0 0 8 fig 7 presents the time averaged k t and 10k q as a function of sdr at variant j fig 7 shows the three k t and 10k q curves at sdr 0 75 1 0 and 1 5 are showing an approximately linear variation trend with j with the exact values of k t and 10k q being very close for the three submergences this indicates a minor free surface effect on the propeller s hydrodynamic performance once sdr surpasses 0 75 hence it can be concluded that if sdr surpasses 0 75 the propeller surface interactions no longer obviously influence the time averaged hydrodynamic performance of this propeller in calm water regardless of j this conclusion can also be reached according to the calm water k t and 10k q curves presented by naito and nakamura 1979 at sdr 0 765 in that the calm water k t and 10k q curves also show an approximately linear variation trend within the range of j 0 1 0 also for sdr 0 167 0 333 and 0 5 the k t and 10k q curves are of an approximately linear variation trend in the range of j 0 3 0 8 but experience an obvious decrease in the range of j 0 0 3 this is because the higher intensity of ventilation at higher loadings results in a more serious thrust loss as can be observed in fig 8 at j 0 left the miniature air bubbles that are driven downstream are of higher density and larger quantity than at j 0 3 right indicating that more air is drawn into the propeller disk hence a higher intensity of ventilation regarding sdr 0 5 differences from our results can be observed in naito and nakamura s k t and 10k q curves which show a linear trend in the range of j 0 4 0 8 but experience an abrupt decrease as j decreases from 0 4 to 0 1 and then increase to some extent as j decreases further to 0 forming an obvious hump at j 0 1 this indicates a more serious free surface effect on this propeller than on our propeller but the reason cannot be precisely identified it is speculated that the difference of the propellers used e g the difference of geometric parameters blade section shapes could possibly be the reason fig 9 compares the experimental results of time averaged k t solid line with the calculated values dotted line based on eq 19 in a range of j 0 0 5 calculated values are higher than measured ones in general especially for high loading region j 0 2 where ventilation is more inclined to occur one reason for this discrepancy is that eq 19 does not consider the ventilation effect on thrust loss as stated in the section 3 2 4 2 dynamic load characteristics in regular waves 4 2 1 a quasi steady method for calculating time dependent thrust torque in waves based on fig 7 we can perform a preliminary estimate of time dependent k t and 10k q of propeller in regular waves using a quasi steady estimate method first proposed by naito and nakamura 1979 this method consists of three steps 1 establish the mathematical relationship among k t 10k q sdr and j in calm water according to fig 7 a and b we can obtain the expression of k t and 10k q as a two variable function by polynomial regression in the form of eq 22 22 k t i j n a i j s d r i j j 10 k q i j n b i j s d r i j j where n is the highest power of the regression polynomial a ij and b ij being regression coefficients 2 divide one regular wave length by several equal distance points 100 points in this case then based on the given sdr j wave amplitude a and period t respectively calculate j ins and sdr ins using eqs 5 and 8 at each point 3 substitute the calculated j ins and sdr ins into eq 22 and we can obtain an estimated value of k t and 10k q at any point fig 10 shows an example of calculated time dependent k t in comparison with corresponding measured results basically the measured and calculated k t curves have similar variation trends while the discrepancy of the exact values can be rather obvious the dominant reason for this difference is that the horizontal inflow velocity at the propeller disk center does not accurately reflect the actual velocity field of non uniform and unsteady oblique inflow to be more specific for a propeller in regular waves it works in a spatially non uniform and periodically time varying oblique flow environment due to the wave orbital velocity except at wave crest and wave trough where the non uniform inflow velocity is axial as a result the dynamic loads of the entire propeller and a single blade are affected by the time varying oblique inflow and the instantaneous load distribution on the propeller disk will be non uniform due to the non uniform inflow another reason is that the breaking of wave profile due to free surface deformation and ventilation is not considered but considering this quasi steady method gives reliable rough prediction of thrust fluctuation trends in spite of acceptable inaccuracy of the exact values we will use it as a comparison with experimental results in section 4 2 2 4 2 2 time dependent kt and 10kq in variant propeller working environments fig 11 shows the dynamic load characteristics at variant sdr 0 167 0 333 0 5 0 75 and 1 0 here s some explanations for fig 11 and all following time dependent k t and 10k q graphs the yellow dotted curves of j ins cal refer to the calculated j ins using eq 5 the sdr ins exp green solid curves left side refers to the sdr ins according to the measured wave profiles the sdr ins cal green solid curves right side however is obtained using eq 8 according to the theoretical regular wave profiles all measured data have been filtered using a low pass filter to preserve the 1st and 2nd wave harmonics according to fig 11 a at the lowest submergence depth sdr 0 167 the dynamic load presents an approximately sinusoidal variation trend in accordance with that of sdr ins this implies that the dynamic load characteristics are dominated by only the periodical variation of submergence depth specifically when the propeller is at wave trough the minimum value of k t and 10k q appears due to a maximum loss of propeller disk area fig 12 a right side at the wave crest the maximum value of k t and 10k q appears where the propeller has the maximum theoretical sdr ins of 0 567 in this case the propeller surface interaction is obvious throughout the whole wave period even at the wave crest as shown in fig 12 a left side a cone shaped free surface vortex is formed near the blade tip implying that the propeller may be surface piercing at the wave crest and that ventilation through this vortex is imminent for sdr 0 333 0 5 and 0 75 as shown in fig 11 b d left side second order wave harmonic components appear on the time dependent k t and 10k q curves near the wave crest where the effect of the periodical variation of inflow velocity is dominant as one would observe as the propeller is approaching the wave crest from partial emergence despite the increasing sdr ins the previously fast growing k t and 10k q cease to increase abruptly at a certain point due to the increasing j ins forming the first local maximum values first red circle in fig 11 d left side after hitting the first local maximum k t and 10k q gradually drop to a local minimum at the wave crest blue circle in fig 11 d left side as j ins gradually hits its maximum and then gradually grow with decreasing j ins until hitting the second local maximum second red circle in fig 11 d left side after this point k t and 10k q drop abruptly with the decreasing sdr ins despite the decreasing j ins that normally causes an increase of them according to this observation in the space between the x coordinates of the first and the second maximum values of k t and 10k q roughly the space between the black solid arrows the dynamic load characteristics are basically in tune with the periodical variation of inflow velocity and almost regardless of that of sdr ins this space will be referred to as velocity influence zone hereinafter we can also observe from fig 11 b d that as sdr increases the periodical variation of inflow velocity imposes more obvious effect on the dynamic load characteristics within a wave period specifically as sdr increases from 0 333 to 0 5 and then 0 75 the magnitude of the gradual drop of k t and 10k q the difference between the first local maximum value and the subsequent local minimum value increases from 15 to approximately 30 and then 50 of the total fluctuation amplitude additionally the area of velocity influence zone increases because with increasing sdr the propeller spends more time being sufficiently deeply submerged within a wave period at this point we start wondering whether there exists a critical value of instantaneous submergence depth that defines the word sufficiently i e that forms the border of the velocity influence zone this will be discussed in section 4 3 despite the growing influence of the periodical variation of inflow velocity the minimum values of k t and 10k q within a wave period still appear at wave trough where the propeller is still surface piercing even for sdr 0 75 fig 12 b d right side we can conclude in these cases the dynamic load characteristics are influenced by both the periodical variation of inflow velocity in the velocity influence zone and by the periodical variation of submergence depth outside the velocity influence zone at sdr 1 0 basically the propeller is fully submerged during a wave period with very limited propeller surface interactions even at wave trough fig 12 e right side according to fig 11 e left side the dynamic load returns to a sinusoidal variation pattern but dominated by the variation trend of j ins rather than by that of sdr ins specifically in contrary to the case of sdr 0 167 the maximum and minimum value of k t and 10k q within a wave period appears respectively at wave trough where j ins hits its minimum and wave crest where j ins hits its maximum we can conclude that in this case the periodical variation of inflow velocity has the dominant effect on the dynamic load characteristics using fast fourier transform fft we have obtained the frequency spectrums of measured k t and 10k q for variant sdr as shown in fig 13 the frequency range is 0 50 hz sampling frequency 100 hz wave frequency is denoted as f w1 0 96 hz corresponding to t 1 0408s obviously the k t and 10k q frequency spectrums are similar regarding both the wave related and propeller related harmonics but with differences in respective amplitudes one can observe the wave frequency and some higher order wave harmonics shaft frequency n 12 hz and blade frequency 4n 48 hz most likely due to the propeller emerging and ventilation as well as the electric noises at 32 hz and 40 hz the differences among the frequencies and respective amplitudes at variant sdrs manifest mostly in the wave related harmonics which is also true for the frequency spectrums at variant whrs and t therefore to offer a clearer view of the higher order wave harmonics fig 14 shows the same frequency spectrums in the range of 0 10 hz for sdr 0 167 green solid lines and 1 0 black dashed lines only 1st wave harmonics are observable while the higher order wave harmonics barely exist this is consistent with fig 11 a and e in which the k t and 10k q time series are showing approximately sinusoidal variation trends also for sdr 0 333 yellow dashed lines 0 5 red dashed lines and 0 75 blue dashed lines second order wave harmonics are observable whose amplitude increases with increasing sdr this is consistent with the observation made with fig 11 b d i e as sdr increases from 0 333 to 0 75 the periodical variation of inflow velocity imposes more obvious effect on the dynamic load characteristics within a wave period regarding the dominant frequency for sdr 0 167 0 333 0 5 and 1 0 it is the wave frequency f w1 0 96 hz that is the dominant frequency the wave frequency amplitude decreases as sdr increases which indicates that the importance of the periodical variation of submergence depth is decreasing on determining the thrust fluctuation behaviors for sdr 0 75 the dominant frequency is twice the wave frequency 2f w1 1 92 hz which indicates that the periodical variation of inflow velocity is playing the dominant role in determining the thrust fluctuation behaviors within the whole wave cycle fig 15 illustrates the dynamic load characteristics at variant whr first of all a conclusion by naito and nakamura 1979 is confirmed i e the wave caused fluctuation amplitude of thrust and torque increases with increasing wave height actually in the present conditions with increasing wave height the increase of k t and 10k q fluctuation amplitude is due to the decrease of sdr ins at the wave trough which results in an increasing loss of effective propeller disk area fig 16 a d right side and consequently a lower k t and 10k q second with the increase of whr the magnitude of the gradual drop of k t and 10k q increases so does the area of the velocity influence zone this implies the periodical variation of inflow velocity has a more obvious influence on the dynamic load characteristics near the wave crest which can be explained in two aspects one with larger wave height comes a larger sdr ins near the wave crest implying that the propeller spends more time rotating in the velocity influence zone and that the propeller surface interaction is almost eliminated at the wave crest fig 16 a d left side two according to eqs 3 5 a larger wave height means a larger variation of j ins within one wave period hence a higher j ins near the wave crest which results in a larger drop magnitude of k t and 10k q fig 17 shows the frequency spectrums of measured k t and 10k q for variant whr in the frequency range 0 10 hz obviously for these cases wave frequency f w1 0 96 hz is the dominant frequency whose amplitude increases steadily with increasing whr this is consistent with the observation fig 15 that the wave caused fluctuation amplitude of k t and 10k q increases with the increasing wave height in addition with the increase of whr the amplitude of the second order wave harmonics are on a steady increase this is consistent with fig 15 which shows that as whr increases there will be a larger velocity influence zone and a lower local minimum of k t and 10k q indicating the periodical variation of inflow velocity exerts a more obvious influence on the dynamic load characteristics near the wave crest with figs 18 21 we discuss the dynamic load characteristics at variant wave periods t in two conditions 1 periodical emergence sdr 0 5 2 full submergence sdr 1 0 first regarding the periodical emergence condition in fig 18 the fluctuation amplitude of k t and 10k q at t 1 3768s is larger than at t 1 0408s which manifests mainly near the wave crest where k t and 10k q is larger at t 1 3768s this is because a larger t results in a smaller j ins near the wave crest according to eq 5 consequently a larger k t and 10k q at the wave trough the minimum k t and 10k q is still slightly higher at t 1 3768s than at t 1 0408s even though j ins is larger at t 1 3768s the possible reason is that at the wave trough the propeller surface interaction is more intense at a smaller j ins at t 1 0408s causing more thrust loss in fig 19 one can observe more drastic water splashing more bubbles drifting downstream and more obvious free surface elevation for t 1 0408s left than for t 1 3768s right second compared to periodical emergence case the effect of t on propeller load in full submergence case will show some differences in two aspects one in full submergence the effect of t on the time dependent thrust and torque will dwindle due to the smaller periodical variation of j ins at a deeper submergence two in full submergence the dynamic load variation is in complete accordance with the variation of j ins thus a larger wave period which means a smaller variation of j ins results in a smaller fluctuation amplitude of k t and 10k q fig 20 confirms this description at the wave crest the minimum k t and 10k q for t 1 3768s is slightly larger than that for t 1 0408s due to the smaller j ins at t 1 3768s as for the maximum k t and 10k q at the wave trough there is no discernible difference between the two wave periods even though j ins is slightly larger at t 1 3768s so that k t and 10k q should be slightly lower similar to the periodical emergence case this might be due to the slightly more obvious propeller surface interaction at the wave trough for t 1 0408s causing a slight amount of thrust loss as shown in fig 21 although no ventilation can be observed for either case the downstream free surface elevation due to propeller generated waves can be more obviously observed at t 1 0408s left side within the red dotted rectangle which could cause slight thrust loss due to propeller wave making fig 22 shows the frequency spectrums of measured k t and 10k q for variant t in the frequency range 0 10 hz first for both wave periods at sdr 0 5 and 1 0 the dominant frequency is the wave frequency f w1 0 96 hz f w2 0 73 hz also one may observe an obviously higher amplitude of f w2 than that of f w1 for sdr 0 5 red and blue solid lines and a slightly lower amplitude of f w2 than f w1 for sdr 1 0 red and blue dashed lines which is consistent with the observations made with figs 18 and 20 regarding the difference in thrust fluctuation amplitude between the two wave periods i e with increasing wave period the wave caused fluctuation amplitude of time dependent thrust and torque increases in a more obvious manner for sdr 0 5 but decreases less obviously for sdr 1 0 regarding the second order wave harmonics at sdr 0 5 2f w1 1 92 hz has an obviously larger amplitude than 2f w2 1 45 hz this manifests a more significant effect of the periodical variation of inflow velocity on the dynamic loads for t 1 0408s due to a larger variation of j ins at sdr 1 0 however no second order wave harmonics can be observed for both wave periods this is because the dynamic load behaviors are dominated by only the periodical variation of inflow velocity as shown in fig 20 in general the effect of wave period on the dynamic load characteristics can be concluded as follows with increasing wave period the wave induced fluctuation amplitude of time dependent thrust and torque increases in a more obvious manner for a propeller undergoing periodical emergence but decreases less obviously for a propeller undergoing full submergence 4 3 critical instantaneous submergence depth in fig 11 b d 15 and 18 one may observe that the borders of the velocity influence zone all correspond to an sdr ins of approximately 0 6 and this value remains roughly constant regardless of propeller working environment this confirms our speculation that there may exist a critical value of instantaneous submergence depth above this value the propeller is so sufficiently deeply submerged that its dynamic load characteristics is almost regardless of the periodical variation of submergence depth reaching up to this critical instantaneous submergence depth from partial emergence in our opinion indicates the propeller surface interactions become a secondary influence factor on the dynamic load characteristics although ventilation phenomenon will continue thereafter in a short time period which can also be responsible for the hysteresis of thrust build up aside from the wagner effect this will be further discussed in a separate section of 4 4 we herein offer some explanations on the underlying physics of the roughly constant critical instantaneous submergence depth for all cases first the first critical instantaneous submergence depth referring to the one that appears as the propeller enters the velocity influence zone is formed at the instant where the propeller surface interactions though still existing after the propeller has entered the velocity influence zone are not strong enough to remain as the dominant effect on the propeller dynamic load behaviours hence the strength of the propeller surface interactions the instantaneous ventilation intensity which is basically influenced by only sdr ins and j ins is the determinant of the first critical instantaneous submergence depth according to figs 15 and 18 for the cases with variant whr or t the j ins corresponding to the first critical instantaneous submergence depth is very similar approximately 0 25 indicating that the first critical instantaneous submergence depth should be similar to ensure a similar instantaneous ventilation intensity as for the three cases with variant sdrs although the j ins corresponding to the first critical instantaneous submergence depth varies from around 0 3 to 0 17 as sdr increases from 0 333 to 0 75 as can be observed in fig 11 a c photos taken in the calm water test cases indicate that the difference is minor between the ventilation intensity at j 0 2 and 0 3 at sdr 0 5 fig 23 hence the first critical instantaneous submergence depth of these three cases should also be similar so that the instantaneous ventilation intensity is similar second the second critical instantaneous submergence depth referring to the one appearing as the propeller is leaving the velocity influence zone is formed due to an impact i e a direct contact between the propeller tip and the free surface see fig 25 right side therefore it is reasonably nearly constant for all cases involved and slightly larger than 0 5 due to propeller suction also although a different j ins may slightly influence the propeller suction strength this influence is minor since the j ins that corresponds to the second critical instantaneous submergence depth varies in a small range of 0 2 0 3 even as sdr varies from 0 75 to 0 333 combining fig 11 a and e we can conclude that if sdr ins never surpasses or falls below 0 6 in a wave period the dynamic load behaviours of this propeller are basically dominated by the periodical variation of submergence depth or the periodical variation of inflow velocity now a critical sdr ins of around 0 6 has been identified for this propeller at j 0 2 via observation however according to koushan s experiment results koushan 2009 figs 15 and 16 of the k t and 10k q time series at sdr 0 8 0 6 whr 1 25 and j 0 4 one may observe that the first and the second local maximum values of k t and 10k q both correspond to an instantaneous submergence depth of around sdr ins 0 75 i e the critical instantaneous submergence depth is roughly at sdr ins 0 75 compared to our study this indicates a stronger propeller surface interaction within a wave cycle i e a higher ventilation intensity as the propeller enters the velocity influence zone and a stronger propeller suction as the propeller leaves the velocity influence zone due to lack of relevant information the reason for this difference between koushan s and our study is unknown and cannot be accurately analyzed although we suppose that it may be the difference of the propeller models used geometric parameters shape of blade section etc it is also worth stating the difference in j in our study j 0 2 in koushan 2009 j 0 4 should not be the reason because an obviously increased j would weaken the propeller surface interactions ventilation intensity and propeller suction intensity and hence result in a lower critical instantaneous submergence depth it must also be pointed out that the critical instantaneous submergence depth identified at j 0 2 might not apply to very high advance ratios such as j 0 6 due to an obviously different ventilation intensity and propeller suction intensity therefore measurements at higher advance ratios should be performed to evaluate the effect of advance ratio on the critical instantaneous submergence depth 4 4 thrust hysteresis evaluation in regular waves thrust hysteresis occurs for a propeller blade entering full submergence from partial emergence in this section focusing on the whole propeller rather than a single blade we perform a rough estimate of the number of revolutions in full submergence for this propeller model to regain full thrust based on the time dependent k t and 10k q curves shown in fig 11 b d and fig 15 b d as described in section 4 2 2 for sdr 0 333 0 5 and 0 75 two local maximum values of k t and 10k q are formed at the borders of the velocity influence zone the gradual development of thrust as the propeller travels through the velocity influence zone manifests in the fact that the first local maximum values of k t and 10k q are always lower than the second and that the values between the first critical instantaneous submergence depth and the wave crest are lower than those between the wave crest and the second critical instantaneous submergence depth considering the full submergence as equivalent to the velocity influence zone our method to roughly evaluate the extent of thrust regain is if the absolute difference between the two local maximum values of k t averaged over 4 wave periods hereinafter referred to as the average difference stops increasing with increasing number of revolutions in full submergence also averaged over 4 periods we deem that the thrust regain is complete this method is applied because the sdr ins around 0 6 and j ins corresponding to these two local maximum values of k t are very similar we can assume that the hysteresis alone causes the difference between these two local maximum values fig 24 shows the evaluation results the average rpt represents the averaged propeller revolutions in full submergence i e the velocity influence zone per wave period t which is obtained first by dividing the time span of the velocity influence zone in each of the 4 wave periods by the propeller rotational rate obtaining the propeller revolution in the velocity influence zone in each wave period and then by averaging the results over the 4 wave periods according to fig 24 a as sdr increases from 0 333 to 0 5 and 0 75 the average rpt red solid lines sees a linear increase from around 3 to around 7 5 as can be confirmed by the frequency spectrums presented by fig 14 which shows that the amplitude of 2nd order wave harmonics increases as sdr increases from 0 333 to 0 75 indicating a larger velocity influence zone and thus more revolutions the propeller goes through while the average difference blue dotted lines ceases to increase at around 0 036 as the average rpt reaches around 5 and then decreases a little to 0 035 after the average rpt reaches around 7 5 on a smaller scale in fig 24 b as whr increases from 0 6 to 1 0 the average rpt also sees an approximately linear increase from around 4 4 to 5 35 as can be confirmed by fig 17 which shows that the amplitude of 2nd order wave harmonics increases steadily as whr increases from 0 6 to 1 0 at the same time the average difference first experiences a faster increase from 0 031 to 0 037 as the average rpt reaches nearly 4 9 and then increases slowly to 0 0375 as the average rpt reaches nearly 5 35 from the above observations we can roughly conclude for this propeller model in this experiment condition that it takes approximately 5 revolutions in full submergence to regain full thrust which is larger than the value inferred by koushan 2004 4 revolutions from the perspective of this experiment the reason for the overestimation besides that our conclusion is based on a rough estimate is that the previously emerging propeller keeps ventilating as sdr ins reaches or slightly surpasses the border of the velocity influence zone fig 25 left side which is consistent with koushan s 2009 observation that once a propeller in waves starts ventilating in regular waves it will keep ventilating even as submergence depth increases this ventilation can cause a certain amount of thrust loss that in practice delays the thrust regain process hence an overestimation compared to koushan s 2004 inference which considers only the wagner effect according to fig 25 serious ventilation can be clearly observed when the propeller is entering the velocity influence zone left but almost unobservable when leaving the velocity influence zone right the more intense ventilation despite the similar sdr ins around 0 6 and j ins at this two positions to our knowledge results from the upward inclination of propeller slipstream when the propeller is entering the velocity influence zone which enhances the propeller surface interactions specifically an upward inclined inflow velocity results in an upward inclination of propeller slipstream as confirmed by various studies concerning propeller in oblique flow such as dubbioso et al 2013 which is the case for the propeller entering the velocity influence zone in this case the enhanced interactions between the tip vortex system and the free surface result in air entrainment through the tip vortex system causing ventilation on the propeller blades high frequency thrust fluctuation and consequent thrust loss this ventilation mechanism is similar to the one confirmed by califano et al 2011b who identifies the tip vortex as the dominating ventilation system for a propeller with sdr 0 75 to better analyze the high frequency thrust fluctuation from this ventilation using a higher sampling frequency 500 hz to more accurately capture the transients we have re measured the following two test conditions sdr 0 5 0 75 whr 0 8 t 1 0408s j 0 2 fig 26 shows the frequency spectrum of the measured k t under the condition of sdr 0 5 whr 0 8 t 1 0408s j 0 2 one can observe the 1st to 5th harmonics of the wave frequency the 1st shaft frequency 12 hz 4th blade frequency 48 hz and other higher order propeller related harmonics an obvious 32 hz frequency component is also observed because it is neither related to the propeller frequencies nor the wave frequencies it is considered as electric noise and will be eliminated according to koushan 2004 and koushan 2007 for near surface propellers high amplitude thrust fluctuation at blade frequency in this case 48 hz happens due to ventilation or even partial emergence this means that we can identify the ventilation effect on the dynamic loads by analyzing the amplitude of blade frequency thrust fluctuations given this in the data processing we used a low pass filter with a cut off frequency of 55 hz to preserve the blade frequency components with a notch filter between 31 and 33 hz to get rid of the electric noise at 32 hz in addition in order to obtain the absolute thrust fluctuation amplitude the raw data was also filtered with a 3 5 hz low pass filter to preserve only the obvious wave related harmonics for the two test conditions the measured k t time series after filtering both kinds the absolute fluctuation amplitude of k t along with sdr ins based on measured water elevation are shown in figs 27 and 28 from figs 27 and 28 one can observe rather high amplitudes of blade frequency thrust fluctuation mostly in the region of sdr ins 0 6 in which the propeller is basically partially emerging also there is an abrupt increase of thrust fluctuation amplitude at sdr ins 0 6 green arrows this is due to the sudden impact between the blade tip and water surface as the propeller leaves the velocity influence zone see fig 25 right side more importantly even after the propeller enters the velocity influence zone sdr ins 0 6 the propeller is basically fully submerged the blade frequency thrust fluctuation continues to be of relatively high amplitude until sdr ins 0 7 surrounded by red dashed rectangular due to the ventilation even after the propeller enters the velocity influence zone this phenomenon serves as proof that the ventilation after the propeller enters the velocity influence zone causes blade frequency thrust fluctuation given the well established fact that ventilation and consequent thrust fluctuation causes thrust loss we have reason to believe that this ventilation and thrust fluctuation cause certain amount of thrust loss that in practice delays the thrust build up however an accurate and quantitative evaluation of the extent of thrust loss from this ventilation related blade frequency thrust fluctuation is not the main research objective of this paper we can conclude that for a propeller in regular waves undergoing periodical emergence the wagner effect may not be the only reason for the thrust hysteresis the thrust loss and fluctuation should be also considered due to upward slipstream inclination and the consequently enhanced interactions between the tip vortex system and the free surface which happens as the previously emerging propeller heads into full submergence 5 concluding remarks this paper offers an in detail and in depth investigation on the dynamic load characteristics and thrust hysteresis of an open water propeller operating in regular head waves through a series of model experiment conducted in a circulating water channel that involves variant submergence depths wave heights and wave periods conclusions are as follows 1 in regular waves a critical instantaneous submergence depth of around l d 0 6 is identified for this propeller model at j 0 2 once the instantaneous submergence depth surpasses this value the dynamic load characteristics are not dominated by the propeller surface interaction but instead dominated by the periodical variation of inflow velocity also if the instantaneous submergence depth never surpasses or falls below the critical value within a wave period the dynamic load characteristics are basically dominated by the periodical variation of submergence depth or by the periodical variation of inflow velocity 2 for a propeller undergoing periodical emergence with the increase of submergence depth or wave height the periodical variation of inflow velocity has more obvious effect on the dynamic load in the velocity influence zone but the minimum thrust always appears at wave trough due to surface piercing with the increase of wave period the absolute fluctuation amplitude of dynamic load increases in a more obvious manner than full submergence for a propeller in full submergence where the instantaneous submergence depth is always above the critical value with the increase of wave period the absolute fluctuation amplitude of dynamic load decreases instead but in a less obvious manner due to a smaller variation of inflow velocity at a deeper submergence 3 regarding the thrust hysteresis for a propeller undergoing periodical emergence in regular waves according to a rough estimate based on measured data it takes approximately 5 revolutions for this propeller model in full submergence to regain full thrust furthermore wagner effect may not be the only reason for the thrust hysteresis in waves there is also thrust fluctuation and loss due to slipstream upward inclination and the consequently enhanced interactions between the tip vortex system and the free surface which happens as the previously emerging propeller enters full submergence for further improvement of the present study more systematic measurements should be performed at a higher advance ratio j e g 0 6 where ventilation can be very limited in order to evaluate the effect of advance

21276,this paper investigates the dynamic load characteristics of a near surface open propeller in regular head waves based on a model experiment in a circulating water channel with the aid of captured free surface profiles the influences of periodical variation of submergence depth and inflow velocity on the dynamic load characteristics are systematically investigated and the thrust hysteresis in periodical emergence condition is quantitatively evaluated as conclusions a critical instantaneous submergence depth is identified for this propeller in regular waves at a certain advance ratio above this value the dynamic load characteristics are not dominated by the propeller surface interactions for a periodically emerged propeller the influence of the periodical variation of inflow velocity on the dynamic load characteristics is more significant as either submergence depth or wave height increases with increasing wave period the wave caused load fluctuation amplitude increases in a more obvious manner in periodical emergence condition but decreases less obviously in full submergence condition regarding the thrust hysteresis it takes approximately 5 revolutions for this propeller in full submergence to regain full thrust lastly the thrust fluctuation and loss due to slipstream inclination is considered responsible for thrust hysteresis which happens as the previously emerged propeller heads into full submergence keywords dynamic load characteristics critical instantaneous submergence depth thrust hysteresis near surface open propeller regular head waves 1 introduction propeller thrust fluctuation is a serious problem constantly encountered by any vessels or dynamic position dp systems in rough seas for vessels thrust fluctuation occurs due to large amplitude pitching and heaving that give the propellers a highly unstable working environment with thrust fluctuation often comes abrupt thrust loss and consequently serious speed loss of the ship for dp systems damages on propeller shaft bearings and interior gears constantly happen due to thrust and torque fluctuation because the propellers constantly operate at high loadings to maintain certain position and heading leading to a high risk of ventilation therefore more knowledge is required on the underlying physics of the dynamic load characteristics of near surface propeller in waves in order to optimize operational strategies and reduce damages dynamic load characteristics of near surface propeller are basically the results of propeller surface interactions we have seen many studies concerning dynamic load characteristics and ventilation of near surface propellers in calm water over the years the early ones including kempf 1934 shiba 1953 and fleischer 1973 are all based on experimental methods earlier in this century koushan 2004 discussed multiple environmental and interaction effects on the thrust loss of thrusters such as out of water effect wagner effect wagner 1925 ventilation effect and thruster thruster interactions in addition koushan 2007 conducted model experiments to study the thrust loss of an open and a ducted propeller due to ventilation at bollard condition in part of the working conditions the two propellers were towed while experiencing forced sinusoidal heave motion ventilation was found as the primary cause of load fluctuations for a thruster undergoing forced heave motions kozlowska et al 2009 observed different ventilation inception mechanisms and analyzed the effect of advance ratio revolution rate submergence depth and time on ventilation inception and thrust loss the authors also found good agreement between experimental values of thrust loss and calculated values based on empirical equations another paper by kozlowska et al 2011 investigated near surface propeller thrust and torque fluctuation during non ventilating and ventilating phases based on numerical and experimental approaches califano et al 2011a focused on the thrust loss of a fully ventilated propeller at high loadings the cause of the deviation between the simulated and measured data was analyzed from the angle of surface tension time step under relaxation factors and so on another paper by califano et al 2011b identified different ventilation regimes through a series of open propeller model experiments at variant submergence depths by measuring dynamic loads and by capturing images of ventilation phenomena using an under water high speed camera the three different ventilation regimes identified are one free surface vortex at a deeper submergence featuring discontinuous thrust losses two tip vortex at a lower submergence featuring uniform thrust loss within a complete revolution and three intermediate in which both regimes free surface vortex and tip vortex act in alternation tokgoz et al 2014 investigated the flow around a near surface propeller at different submergence depths using a body force model that could successfully simulate the effect of free surface on the propeller adjacent flow characteristics paik et al 2008 studied the adjacent flow field characteristics of a near surface open propeller at variant submergence depths and loading conditions as the propeller approaches the free surface the acceleration of inflow velocity decreases so does the axial momentum from the propeller blade tip to the slipstream region paik 2017 numerically studied the hydrodynamic performance and the flow field of a propeller operating beneath the free surface various advance ratios and submergence depths were chosen for simulations considering both the ventilation effect and the out of water effect on the hydrodynamic performance of a near surface propeller in calm water kozlowska et al 2020 used a time domain model to calculate thrust loss and torque loss the calculation results were compared against experiments and cfd simulations and found to be have better agreement with cfd results than with experimental results as for the near surface open propeller in waves the two papers by nakamura and naito 1975 1979 were the first systematical experimental studies experiments were arranged with forced pitch and heave oscillation under variant wave frequencies and advance ratios the authors identified two components of propeller load fluctuations in waves namely the orbital velocity variation and submergence variation faltinsen et al 1981 investigated the ventilation effect on time average thrust and torque of propellers in waves and minsaas et al 1983 discussed the effect of periodic variations in propeller immersion on propulsive performance in head seas one of the most important findings of these two papers is the mathematical modelling of the time averaged propeller thrust loss as a function of the ratio between submergence depth and propeller radius several contributing factors of the thrust loss were considered in the modelling namely the loss of effective disk area the propeller wave making and the wagner effect wagner 1925 i e for an airfoil accelerating instantaneously from rest to a certain speed the build up of steady state lift is however a gradual process cao 1988 conducted experiments on the hydrodynamic performance of an open propeller with variant submergence depths in regular waves it was found that the difference between the time averaged hydrodynamic performance of propeller in calm water and waves is not obvious at a sufficiently large submergence depth but rather obvious if the submergence decreases politis 1999 performed open propeller tests in both regular and irregular waves with different submergence depths advance ratios and wave parameters it was found for a propeller deeply submerged in regular waves load variation is 180 out of phase with the water surface elevation for a propeller in irregular waves at low submergence load variation is dominated by ventilation while the averaged thrust can be described as a function of submergence to diameter ratio and significant wave height koushan et al 2009 conducted an experiment concerning the effect of regular waves and ventilation on the time averaged and dynamic load of an open propeller the author ascribes the dynamic load behaviors to the water surface elevation because the maximum and minimum thrust are identified respectively at wave crest and wave trough guo et al 2012 experimentally studied the time averaged and time dependent thrust and torque of a propeller in regular waves at variant submergence depths and advance speeds the authors noticed that the load variation period is coincident with wave period due to the existence of waves more recently several numerical studies have been published for example bondarenko and kashiwagi 2011 examined a mathematical model that connects the spectrum of incident waves and the variance of torque fluctuation of racing propeller and validated this model through a comparison with cfd results of propeller torque fluctuation at racing condition in irregular waves using a propeller body force model tokgoz et al 2017 et al investigated the dynamic loads of an mau series five bladed propeller and the kvlcc2 propeller in regular head waves the simulated thrust and torque time series were compared with the experimental ones by nakamura and naito 1979 and good agreement was found for conditions at lower loadings zhao et al 2017 did a comparison study on propeller dynamic loads at two different advance speeds using numerical and experimental methods it was concluded that the propeller propulsive efficiency in waves is not necessarily lower than in calm water based on both quasi steady and fully unsteady approaches saettone et al 2020 predicted the propeller hydrodynamic performance in the presence of waves under both open water and behind hull conditions the authors found good agreement between the two approaches in the prediction of unsteady propeller forces cavitation volume and hull pressure pulses which proves the validity of the quasi steady approach in computing propeller performance in waves the previous studies have yielded great achievements and given us abundant inspiration however investigations are inadequate regarding the physical mechanism of the dynamic load characteristics of propeller in waves only several previous studies e g nakamura and naito 1979 minsaas et al 1983 koushan et al 2009 tokgoz et al 2017 guo et al 2012 and zhao et al 2017 have given attention to the time dependent characteristics of thrust and torque in waves furthermore in order to gain more knowledge of the thrust hysteresis on a periodically emerging propeller in regular waves quantitative analysis should be conducted using experimental methods the thrust hysteresis or hysteresis effect is an important consideration factor for thrust estimation with ventilated propeller referring to the delay in thrust development during periodical emergence which is considered to be related to the wagner effect when an emerged propeller blade with typical design and typical pitch ratio heads into full submergence as inferred by koushan 2004 it takes approximately four revolutions to regain full thrust to our knowledge hysteresis effect was investigated by faltinsen et al 1981 and minsaas et al 1983 discussed by koushan 2004 and califano 2010 and considered by kozlowska et al 2009 in the calculations of thrust loss based on empirical equations however regarding an open propeller in regular waves no quantitative experimental evaluation of hysteresis effect have yet been conducted to sum up in this paper we present an experimental investigation conducted in a circulating water channel cwc primarily on the dynamic load characteristics as well as the thrust hysteresis of a near surface open propeller model in regular head waves the main works of this paper are summarized into four parts 1 first we investigated the time averaged propeller hydrodynamic performance in calm water at variant submergence depths and advance speeds then based on calm water results we predicted the propeller s time dependent thrust and torque in regular waves using a quasi steady method in order to provide a comparison with measured data in regular waves 2 for each test condition in waves we discussed the different influences of periodical variation of submergence depth and inflow velocity on the dynamic load characteristics with the help of free surface profiles captured by high resolution camera for a systematical research test conditions comprise variant submergence depths wave heights and wave periods 3 based on the discussions in 2 we identified a critical instantaneous submergence depth for this propeller model at a certain advance ratio above this instantaneous submergence depth the dynamic load is almost independent of the periodical variation of submergence depth but rather dominated by the periodical variation of inflow velocity 4 regarding the thrust hysteresis in regular waves we roughly estimated the number of revolutions in full submergence for the propeller to regain full thrust also we noticed a rather intense ventilation phenomenon with the captured free surface profiles which can also contribute to the hysteresis aside from the wagner effect 2 description of the experiment 2 1 propeller model a four bladed right handed mau series propeller is used for the experiment table 1 shows its main particulars 2 2 non dimensional coefficients and reference frame thrust coefficient and torque coefficient are defined as

above the values of around 180 shiba 1953 in this experiment we is approximately 65 a cartesian reference frame o xyz is established in fig 1 the origin o is located at the intersection among the static water surface the vertical axis z and the left end of cwc test section figs 2 and 5 show sketches of cwc test section the x axis points towards the stern which is parallel with the propeller axis the y axis points towards the starboard direction z axis to the vertical direction 2 3 test conditions test conditions are summarized as table 2 where t represents regular wave period the wave steepness of each regular wave test condition is expressed in the form of ak as shown in table 3 which reveals the linearity of the generated waves 2 4 wave quality evaluation this experiment was conducted in the circulating water channel cwc laboratory of shanghai jiao tong university the cwc test section is 8 0 m long and 3 0 m wide the constant water depth is 1 6 m before the propeller loading experiment to evaluate the generated wave quality we measured the water surface elevation under two representative wave heights h 5 2 7 8 cm corresponding to whr 0 4 0 6 t 1 0408s and constant inflow velocity v a 0 312 m s corresponding to j 0 2 two monitoring points were chosen for this measurement fig 2 shows the general arrangement of wave quality evaluation the cwc test section is equipped with a flap type wave maker at the left end and a flow transparent type wave absorber at the right end as shown in fig 3 the open boat device is placed in the exact same location as in the propeller loading experiment in order to simulate the actual flow field environment we positioned one wave height meter whm 2 in the center of cwc test section x 4 m y 0 m the same position as the propeller model disk center in the propeller loading experiment the other wave height meter whm 1 is positioned 0 8 m upstream of whm 2 x 3 2 m y 0 m fig 4 a and b show the measured water surface elevation of the two wave conditions it can be observed that the measured wave height and wave period remain stable over time and there is hardly any discernible wave surface deformation for a quantified evaluation of the generated wave quality the following two tables tables 4 and 5 present the measured wave height h crest crest periods t crest crest and trough trough periods t trough trough in each wave cycle and averaged in 10 wave cycles at the propeller disk center for the two wave conditions and the relative error against the desired values note that the relative error corresponding to the average means the relative error of the averaged value against the desired value regarding the generated wave height for the two wave conditions the generated wave height has a slight difference than the desired value which is less than 5 for almost all wave cycles and around 2 2 1 and 1 9 for the averaged value in 10 wave cycles there does exist one oddly large wave height in the 6th wave cycle as shown in table 3 9 6 higher than the desired wave height but we consider this an occasional outlier also it can be observed that the wave amplitude varies with time but this variation is less than 2 the desired wave height in most wave cycles regarding the generated wave period for the two conditions the difference between the generated and desired value is even smaller than the difference in wave height for each wave cycle the relative error is no larger than 2 for the averaged value in 10 wave cycles the relative error is less than 0 5 to sum up we deem the generated waves are of satisfactory quality regarding both the accuracy of wave height and period 2 5 arrangement of propeller loading experiment fig 5 shows the general arrangement of the propeller loading experiment a dynamometer and an electric motor which are linked with each other are placed inside the open boat device and then linked to the propeller axis the propeller model is mounted on the propeller axis and located in the center of the cwc test section x 4 m y 0 m two wave height meters which are positioned symmetrically about the propeller axis are 2 m away from each other in y axis direction y 1 1 m y 2 1 m and 0 4 m upstream of the propeller model x 1 x 2 3 6 m the submergence depth of propeller model is adjusted by rotating the height regulator on top of the open boat device and the desired advance ratio is achieved by adjusting the set value of inflow velocity a high resolution video camera is located right near the side window of the cwc working section to capture the free surface profiles through the whole experiment the measured data in both calm water and regular wave test conditions are obtained over a time range of 30s the 30s time window ensures at least 20 wave cycles for regular wave test cases around 21 wave cycles for the largest wave period t 1 3768s and around 28 for the smallest wave period t 1 0408s and 360 propeller revolutions for calm water cases given that n 12r s the measured data i e the time series of thrust torque and water surface elevation are transmitted through the data line to the controlling computer aside the cwc test section sampling frequency of experiment data equals 100 hz fig 6 shows a photo taken by the video camera in the propeller loading experiment 3 uncertainty analysis ua 3 1 general ua methodology for propeller open water test the present uncertainty analysis is based on the ittc procedures and guidelines 7 5 02 03 02 2 ittc 2014 the measurement of uncertainty is indicated by the 95 confidence uncertainty u rss which is estimated with a root sum square rss as follows 14 u rss p r 2 b r 2 where p r b r represent the precision limit and bias limit respectively r j k t k q to estimate the bias limits b r we must first determine the bias limit b x of all individual variables x in this case x v a n d ρ t and q then calculate b r using the error propagation equation below 15 b r x θ x 2 b x 2 where θ x r x refers to the sensitivity coefficient of each b x the bias limits of n d ρ t and q were obtained following the procedure introduced in the ittc procedures and guidelines 7 5 02 03 02 2 the bias of inflow velocity v a in cwc b va referring to the discrepancy between the measured and the desired flow velocity which results from the flow velocity non uniformity in the cwc working section was determined using the method introduced herein first a pitot tube was installed at the center of the cwc working section i e 4 0 0 where the propeller disk center was located and the flow velocity fully developed then the pitot tube was moved along the y axis and z axis within the periphery of propeller radius to measure the local flow velocity v ameas i at n different locations on the propeller disk plane hence the bias limit b vameas due to flow velocity non uniformity can be calculated with the equation below 16 b v a meas 2 s e e 2 i 1 n v s e t v a m e a s i 2 n 2 in addition considering the error of the measurement with the pitot tube b vapito the total bias limit b va is written as 17 b v a b v a m e a s 2 b v a p i t o 2 the bias of submergence depth b l 0 0015 m referring to the error from measuring the submergence depth of the propeller axis with a ruler fixated on the open boat device b l consists of the reading error on the fixated ruler 0 001 m and an unquantifiable error between the propeller axis center at sdr 0 and the actual static water level the b l of 0 0015 m will cause a bias of 0 0115 on sdr b l d 0 0015m 0 13 m 0 0115 and on the critical instantaneous submergence depth which will be discussed in section 4 3 precision limits for multiple tests was obtained by multiple test measurements of thrust and torque which is given by the equation below 18 p r 2 s r m where s r represents the standard deviation of the measured values and m 12 is the number of repeats we selected the test condition of j 0 2 and sdr 0 5 in calm water for multiple test procedure 3 2 bias from error of propeller submergence depth an approximated formula proposed by minsaas et al 1983 is used to determine the mathematical relationship between submergence depth l and k t k q of near surface propeller in calm water as written in eq 19 this equation is an approximated expression of near surface propeller thrust loss as a function of submergence radius ratio according to kozlowska 2009 and califano 2010 this equation considers three contributing factors to thrust loss namely the loss of propeller effective disk area the wagner effect and the wave making by the propeller the thrust loss due to ventilation however is not considered 19 β k t n k t 1 0 675 1 0 769 l r p 1 258 l r p 1 3 where r p 0 065 m is propeller model radius β being the ratio between k tn k t at a certain l lower than 1 3 r j 0 2 and k t 0 2728 k t without considering the free surface at j 0 2 the mathematical relationship between k qn k q at a certain l lower than 1 3r p j 0 2 and l can be roughly determined by eq 20 20 k q n β m k q where m is a constant between 0 8 and 0 85 minsaas et al 1983 m 0 82 in this paper k q 0 0344 k q without considering the free surface

all biases and sensitive coefficients according to table 7 the percentage of u rss to the average value of k t is higher than that of k q the contribution of precision limit p r of both k t and k q to u rss is less than 1 of the total uncertainty however the contribution of total bias limit of k t and k q to u rss is over 99 for j the bias of inflow velocity is the dominant bias while the contribution of bias of n and d is almost negligible also for k t k q although the primary bias is the thrust torque bias b t b q the bias of submergence depth b l is also quite important therefore for near surface propeller experiment ua must consider the bias of submergence depth 4 results and discussions 4 1 time averaged hydrodynamic performance in calm water before the regular wave propeller loading experiment we did some measurements of the time averaged k t and 10k q in calm water in order to validate our experimental results against calculated values based on eq 19 and results from naito and nakamura 1979 and to offer benchmark data for the quasi steady prediction method of propeller performance in regular waves section 4 2 1 tests were conducted at six sdrs 0 167 0 333 0 5 0 75 1 0 and 1 5 in the range of j 0 0 8 fig 7 presents the time averaged k t and 10k q as a function of sdr at variant j fig 7 shows the three k t and 10k q curves at sdr 0 75 1 0 and 1 5 are showing an approximately linear variation trend with j with the exact values of k t and 10k q being very close for the three submergences this indicates a minor free surface effect on the propeller s hydrodynamic performance once sdr surpasses 0 75 hence it can be concluded that if sdr surpasses 0 75 the propeller surface interactions no longer obviously influence the time averaged hydrodynamic performance of this propeller in calm water regardless of j this conclusion can also be reached according to the calm water k t and 10k q curves presented by naito and nakamura 1979 at sdr 0 765 in that the calm water k t and 10k q curves also show an approximately linear variation trend within the range of j 0 1 0 also for sdr 0 167 0 333 and 0 5 the k t and 10k q curves are of an approximately linear variation trend in the range of j 0 3 0 8 but experience an obvious decrease in the range of j 0 0 3 this is because the higher intensity of ventilation at higher loadings results in a more serious thrust loss as can be observed in fig 8 at j 0 left the miniature air bubbles that are driven downstream are of higher density and larger quantity than at j 0 3 right indicating that more air is drawn into the propeller disk hence a higher intensity of ventilation regarding sdr 0 5 differences from our results can be observed in naito and nakamura s k t and 10k q curves which show a linear trend in the range of j 0 4 0 8 but experience an abrupt decrease as j decreases from 0 4 to 0 1 and then increase to some extent as j decreases further to 0 forming an obvious hump at j 0 1 this indicates a more serious free surface effect on this propeller than on our propeller but the reason cannot be precisely identified it is speculated that the difference of the propellers used e g the difference of geometric parameters blade section shapes could possibly be the reason fig 9 compares the experimental results of time averaged k t solid line with the calculated values dotted line based on eq 19 in a range of j 0 0 5 calculated values are higher than measured ones in general especially for high loading region j 0 2 where ventilation is more inclined to occur one reason for this discrepancy is that eq 19 does not consider the ventilation effect on thrust loss as stated in the section 3 2 4 2 dynamic load characteristics in regular waves 4 2 1 a quasi steady method for calculating time dependent thrust torque in waves based on fig 7 we can perform a preliminary estimate of time dependent k t and 10k q of propeller in regular waves using a quasi steady estimate method first proposed by naito and nakamura 1979 this method consists of three steps 1 establish the mathematical relationship among k t 10k q sdr and j in calm water according to fig 7 a and b we can obtain the expression of k t and 10k q as a two variable function by polynomial regression in the form of eq 22 22 k t i j n a i j s d r i j j 10 k q i j n b i j s d r i j j where n is the highest power of the regression polynomial a ij and b ij being regression coefficients 2 divide one regular wave length by several equal distance points 100 points in this case then based on the given sdr j wave amplitude a and period t respectively calculate j ins and sdr ins using eqs 5 and 8 at each point 3 substitute the calculated j ins and sdr ins into eq 22 and we can obtain an estimated value of k t and 10k q at any point fig 10 shows an example of calculated time dependent k t in comparison with corresponding measured results basically the measured and calculated k t curves have similar variation trends while the discrepancy of the exact values can be rather obvious the dominant reason for this difference is that the horizontal inflow velocity at the propeller disk center does not accurately reflect the actual velocity field of non uniform and unsteady oblique inflow to be more specific for a propeller in regular waves it works in a spatially non uniform and periodically time varying oblique flow environment due to the wave orbital velocity except at wave crest and wave trough where the non uniform inflow velocity is axial as a result the dynamic loads of the entire propeller and a single blade are affected by the time varying oblique inflow and the instantaneous load distribution on the propeller disk will be non uniform due to the non uniform inflow another reason is that the breaking of wave profile due to free surface deformation and ventilation is not considered but considering this quasi steady method gives reliable rough prediction of thrust fluctuation trends in spite of acceptable inaccuracy of the exact values we will use it as a comparison with experimental results in section 4 2 2 4 2 2 time dependent kt and 10kq in variant propeller working environments fig 11 shows the dynamic load characteristics at variant sdr 0 167 0 333 0 5 0 75 and 1 0 here s some explanations for fig 11 and all following time dependent k t and 10k q graphs the yellow dotted curves of j ins cal refer to the calculated j ins using eq 5 the sdr ins exp green solid curves left side refers to the sdr ins according to the measured wave profiles the sdr ins cal green solid curves right side however is obtained using eq 8 according to the theoretical regular wave profiles all measured data have been filtered using a low pass filter to preserve the 1st and 2nd wave harmonics according to fig 11 a at the lowest submergence depth sdr 0 167 the dynamic load presents an approximately sinusoidal variation trend in accordance with that of sdr ins this implies that the dynamic load characteristics are dominated by only the periodical variation of submergence depth specifically when the propeller is at wave trough the minimum value of k t and 10k q appears due to a maximum loss of propeller disk area fig 12 a right side at the wave crest the maximum value of k t and 10k q appears where the propeller has the maximum theoretical sdr ins of 0 567 in this case the propeller surface interaction is obvious throughout the whole wave period even at the wave crest as shown in fig 12 a left side a cone shaped free surface vortex is formed near the blade tip implying that the propeller may be surface piercing at the wave crest and that ventilation through this vortex is imminent for sdr 0 333 0 5 and 0 75 as shown in fig 11 b d left side second order wave harmonic components appear on the time dependent k t and 10k q curves near the wave crest where the effect of the periodical variation of inflow velocity is dominant as one would observe as the propeller is approaching the wave crest from partial emergence despite the increasing sdr ins the previously fast growing k t and 10k q cease to increase abruptly at a certain point due to the increasing j ins forming the first local maximum values first red circle in fig 11 d left side after hitting the first local maximum k t and 10k q gradually drop to a local minimum at the wave crest blue circle in fig 11 d left side as j ins gradually hits its maximum and then gradually grow with decreasing j ins until hitting the second local maximum second red circle in fig 11 d left side after this point k t and 10k q drop abruptly with the decreasing sdr ins despite the decreasing j ins that normally causes an increase of them according to this observation in the space between the x coordinates of the first and the second maximum values of k t and 10k q roughly the space between the black solid arrows the dynamic load characteristics are basically in tune with the periodical variation of inflow velocity and almost regardless of that of sdr ins this space will be referred to as velocity influence zone hereinafter we can also observe from fig 11 b d that as sdr increases the periodical variation of inflow velocity imposes more obvious effect on the dynamic load characteristics within a wave period specifically as sdr increases from 0 333 to 0 5 and then 0 75 the magnitude of the gradual drop of k t and 10k q the difference between the first local maximum value and the subsequent local minimum value increases from 15 to approximately 30 and then 50 of the total fluctuation amplitude additionally the area of velocity influence zone increases because with increasing sdr the propeller spends more time being sufficiently deeply submerged within a wave period at this point we start wondering whether there exists a critical value of instantaneous submergence depth that defines the word sufficiently i e that forms the border of the velocity influence zone this will be discussed in section 4 3 despite the growing influence of the periodical variation of inflow velocity the minimum values of k t and 10k q within a wave period still appear at wave trough where the propeller is still surface piercing even for sdr 0 75 fig 12 b d right side we can conclude in these cases the dynamic load characteristics are influenced by both the periodical variation of inflow velocity in the velocity influence zone and by the periodical variation of submergence depth outside the velocity influence zone at sdr 1 0 basically the propeller is fully submerged during a wave period with very limited propeller surface interactions even at wave trough fig 12 e right side according to fig 11 e left side the dynamic load returns to a sinusoidal variation pattern but dominated by the variation trend of j ins rather than by that of sdr ins specifically in contrary to the case of sdr 0 167 the maximum and minimum value of k t and 10k q within a wave period appears respectively at wave trough where j ins hits its minimum and wave crest where j ins hits its maximum we can conclude that in this case the periodical variation of inflow velocity has the dominant effect on the dynamic load characteristics using fast fourier transform fft we have obtained the frequency spectrums of measured k t and 10k q for variant sdr as shown in fig 13 the frequency range is 0 50 hz sampling frequency 100 hz wave frequency is denoted as f w1 0 96 hz corresponding to t 1 0408s obviously the k t and 10k q frequency spectrums are similar regarding both the wave related and propeller related harmonics but with differences in respective amplitudes one can observe the wave frequency and some higher order wave harmonics shaft frequency n 12 hz and blade frequency 4n 48 hz most likely due to the propeller emerging and ventilation as well as the electric noises at 32 hz and 40 hz the differences among the frequencies and respective amplitudes at variant sdrs manifest mostly in the wave related harmonics which is also true for the frequency spectrums at variant whrs and t therefore to offer a clearer view of the higher order wave harmonics fig 14 shows the same frequency spectrums in the range of 0 10 hz for sdr 0 167 green solid lines and 1 0 black dashed lines only 1st wave harmonics are observable while the higher order wave harmonics barely exist this is consistent with fig 11 a and e in which the k t and 10k q time series are showing approximately sinusoidal variation trends also for sdr 0 333 yellow dashed lines 0 5 red dashed lines and 0 75 blue dashed lines second order wave harmonics are observable whose amplitude increases with increasing sdr this is consistent with the observation made with fig 11 b d i e as sdr increases from 0 333 to 0 75 the periodical variation of inflow velocity imposes more obvious effect on the dynamic load characteristics within a wave period regarding the dominant frequency for sdr 0 167 0 333 0 5 and 1 0 it is the wave frequency f w1 0 96 hz that is the dominant frequency the wave frequency amplitude decreases as sdr increases which indicates that the importance of the periodical variation of submergence depth is decreasing on determining the thrust fluctuation behaviors for sdr 0 75 the dominant frequency is twice the wave frequency 2f w1 1 92 hz which indicates that the periodical variation of inflow velocity is playing the dominant role in determining the thrust fluctuation behaviors within the whole wave cycle fig 15 illustrates the dynamic load characteristics at variant whr first of all a conclusion by naito and nakamura 1979 is confirmed i e the wave caused fluctuation amplitude of thrust and torque increases with increasing wave height actually in the present conditions with increasing wave height the increase of k t and 10k q fluctuation amplitude is due to the decrease of sdr ins at the wave trough which results in an increasing loss of effective propeller disk area fig 16 a d right side and consequently a lower k t and 10k q second with the increase of whr the magnitude of the gradual drop of k t and 10k q increases so does the area of the velocity influence zone this implies the periodical variation of inflow velocity has a more obvious influence on the dynamic load characteristics near the wave crest which can be explained in two aspects one with larger wave height comes a larger sdr ins near the wave crest implying that the propeller spends more time rotating in the velocity influence zone and that the propeller surface interaction is almost eliminated at the wave crest fig 16 a d left side two according to eqs 3 5 a larger wave height means a larger variation of j ins within one wave period hence a higher j ins near the wave crest which results in a larger drop magnitude of k t and 10k q fig 17 shows the frequency spectrums of measured k t and 10k q for variant whr in the frequency range 0 10 hz obviously for these cases wave frequency f w1 0 96 hz is the dominant frequency whose amplitude increases steadily with increasing whr this is consistent with the observation fig 15 that the wave caused fluctuation amplitude of k t and 10k q increases with the increasing wave height in addition with the increase of whr the amplitude of the second order wave harmonics are on a steady increase this is consistent with fig 15 which shows that as whr increases there will be a larger velocity influence zone and a lower local minimum of k t and 10k q indicating the periodical variation of inflow velocity exerts a more obvious influence on the dynamic load characteristics near the wave crest with figs 18 21 we discuss the dynamic load characteristics at variant wave periods t in two conditions 1 periodical emergence sdr 0 5 2 full submergence sdr 1 0 first regarding the periodical emergence condition in fig 18 the fluctuation amplitude of k t and 10k q at t 1 3768s is larger than at t 1 0408s which manifests mainly near the wave crest where k t and 10k q is larger at t 1 3768s this is because a larger t results in a smaller j ins near the wave crest according to eq 5 consequently a larger k t and 10k q at the wave trough the minimum k t and 10k q is still slightly higher at t 1 3768s than at t 1 0408s even though j ins is larger at t 1 3768s the possible reason is that at the wave trough the propeller surface interaction is more intense at a smaller j ins at t 1 0408s causing more thrust loss in fig 19 one can observe more drastic water splashing more bubbles drifting downstream and more obvious free surface elevation for t 1 0408s left than for t 1 3768s right second compared to periodical emergence case the effect of t on propeller load in full submergence case will show some differences in two aspects one in full submergence the effect of t on the time dependent thrust and torque will dwindle due to the smaller periodical variation of j ins at a deeper submergence two in full submergence the dynamic load variation is in complete accordance with the variation of j ins thus a larger wave period which means a smaller variation of j ins results in a smaller fluctuation amplitude of k t and 10k q fig 20 confirms this description at the wave crest the minimum k t and 10k q for t 1 3768s is slightly larger than that for t 1 0408s due to the smaller j ins at t 1 3768s as for the maximum k t and 10k q at the wave trough there is no discernible difference between the two wave periods even though j ins is slightly larger at t 1 3768s so that k t and 10k q should be slightly lower similar to the periodical emergence case this might be due to the slightly more obvious propeller surface interaction at the wave trough for t 1 0408s causing a slight amount of thrust loss as shown in fig 21 although no ventilation can be observed for either case the downstream free surface elevation due to propeller generated waves can be more obviously observed at t 1 0408s left side within the red dotted rectangle which could cause slight thrust loss due to propeller wave making fig 22 shows the frequency spectrums of measured k t and 10k q for variant t in the frequency range 0 10 hz first for both wave periods at sdr 0 5 and 1 0 the dominant frequency is the wave frequency f w1 0 96 hz f w2 0 73 hz also one may observe an obviously higher amplitude of f w2 than that of f w1 for sdr 0 5 red and blue solid lines and a slightly lower amplitude of f w2 than f w1 for sdr 1 0 red and blue dashed lines which is consistent with the observations made with figs 18 and 20 regarding the difference in thrust fluctuation amplitude between the two wave periods i e with increasing wave period the wave caused fluctuation amplitude of time dependent thrust and torque increases in a more obvious manner for sdr 0 5 but decreases less obviously for sdr 1 0 regarding the second order wave harmonics at sdr 0 5 2f w1 1 92 hz has an obviously larger amplitude than 2f w2 1 45 hz this manifests a more significant effect of the periodical variation of inflow velocity on the dynamic loads for t 1 0408s due to a larger variation of j ins at sdr 1 0 however no second order wave harmonics can be observed for both wave periods this is because the dynamic load behaviors are dominated by only the periodical variation of inflow velocity as shown in fig 20 in general the effect of wave period on the dynamic load characteristics can be concluded as follows with increasing wave period the wave induced fluctuation amplitude of time dependent thrust and torque increases in a more obvious manner for a propeller undergoing periodical emergence but decreases less obviously for a propeller undergoing full submergence 4 3 critical instantaneous submergence depth in fig 11 b d 15 and 18 one may observe that the borders of the velocity influence zone all correspond to an sdr ins of approximately 0 6 and this value remains roughly constant regardless of propeller working environment this confirms our speculation that there may exist a critical value of instantaneous submergence depth above this value the propeller is so sufficiently deeply submerged that its dynamic load characteristics is almost regardless of the periodical variation of submergence depth reaching up to this critical instantaneous submergence depth from partial emergence in our opinion indicates the propeller surface interactions become a secondary influence factor on the dynamic load characteristics although ventilation phenomenon will continue thereafter in a short time period which can also be responsible for the hysteresis of thrust build up aside from the wagner effect this will be further discussed in a separate section of 4 4 we herein offer some explanations on the underlying physics of the roughly constant critical instantaneous submergence depth for all cases first the first critical instantaneous submergence depth referring to the one that appears as the propeller enters the velocity influence zone is formed at the instant where the propeller surface interactions though still existing after the propeller has entered the velocity influence zone are not strong enough to remain as the dominant effect on the propeller dynamic load behaviours hence the strength of the propeller surface interactions the instantaneous ventilation intensity which is basically influenced by only sdr ins and j ins is the determinant of the first critical instantaneous submergence depth according to figs 15 and 18 for the cases with variant whr or t the j ins corresponding to the first critical instantaneous submergence depth is very similar approximately 0 25 indicating that the first critical instantaneous submergence depth should be similar to ensure a similar instantaneous ventilation intensity as for the three cases with variant sdrs although the j ins corresponding to the first critical instantaneous submergence depth varies from around 0 3 to 0 17 as sdr increases from 0 333 to 0 75 as can be observed in fig 11 a c photos taken in the calm water test cases indicate that the difference is minor between the ventilation intensity at j 0 2 and 0 3 at sdr 0 5 fig 23 hence the first critical instantaneous submergence depth of these three cases should also be similar so that the instantaneous ventilation intensity is similar second the second critical instantaneous submergence depth referring to the one appearing as the propeller is leaving the velocity influence zone is formed due to an impact i e a direct contact between the propeller tip and the free surface see fig 25 right side therefore it is reasonably nearly constant for all cases involved and slightly larger than 0 5 due to propeller suction also although a different j ins may slightly influence the propeller suction strength this influence is minor since the j ins that corresponds to the second critical instantaneous submergence depth varies in a small range of 0 2 0 3 even as sdr varies from 0 75 to 0 333 combining fig 11 a and e we can conclude that if sdr ins never surpasses or falls below 0 6 in a wave period the dynamic load behaviours of this propeller are basically dominated by the periodical variation of submergence depth or the periodical variation of inflow velocity now a critical sdr ins of around 0 6 has been identified for this propeller at j 0 2 via observation however according to koushan s experiment results koushan 2009 figs 15 and 16 of the k t and 10k q time series at sdr 0 8 0 6 whr 1 25 and j 0 4 one may observe that the first and the second local maximum values of k t and 10k q both correspond to an instantaneous submergence depth of around sdr ins 0 75 i e the critical instantaneous submergence depth is roughly at sdr ins 0 75 compared to our study this indicates a stronger propeller surface interaction within a wave cycle i e a higher ventilation intensity as the propeller enters the velocity influence zone and a stronger propeller suction as the propeller leaves the velocity influence zone due to lack of relevant information the reason for this difference between koushan s and our study is unknown and cannot be accurately analyzed although we suppose that it may be the difference of the propeller models used geometric parameters shape of blade section etc it is also worth stating the difference in j in our study j 0 2 in koushan 2009 j 0 4 should not be the reason because an obviously increased j would weaken the propeller surface interactions ventilation intensity and propeller suction intensity and hence result in a lower critical instantaneous submergence depth it must also be pointed out that the critical instantaneous submergence depth identified at j 0 2 might not apply to very high advance ratios such as j 0 6 due to an obviously different ventilation intensity and propeller suction intensity therefore measurements at higher advance ratios should be performed to evaluate the effect of advance ratio on the critical instantaneous submergence depth 4 4 thrust hysteresis evaluation in regular waves thrust hysteresis occurs for a propeller blade entering full submergence from partial emergence in this section focusing on the whole propeller rather than a single blade we perform a rough estimate of the number of revolutions in full submergence for this propeller model to regain full thrust based on the time dependent k t and 10k q curves shown in fig 11 b d and fig 15 b d as described in section 4 2 2 for sdr 0 333 0 5 and 0 75 two local maximum values of k t and 10k q are formed at the borders of the velocity influence zone the gradual development of thrust as the propeller travels through the velocity influence zone manifests in the fact that the first local maximum values of k t and 10k q are always lower than the second and that the values between the first critical instantaneous submergence depth and the wave crest are lower than those between the wave crest and the second critical instantaneous submergence depth considering the full submergence as equivalent to the velocity influence zone our method to roughly evaluate the extent of thrust regain is if the absolute difference between the two local maximum values of k t averaged over 4 wave periods hereinafter referred to as the average difference stops increasing with increasing number of revolutions in full submergence also averaged over 4 periods we deem that the thrust regain is complete this method is applied because the sdr ins around 0 6 and j ins corresponding to these two local maximum values of k t are very similar we can assume that the hysteresis alone causes the difference between these two local maximum values fig 24 shows the evaluation results the average rpt represents the averaged propeller revolutions in full submergence i e the velocity influence zone per wave period t which is obtained first by dividing the time span of the velocity influence zone in each of the 4 wave periods by the propeller rotational rate obtaining the propeller revolution in the velocity influence zone in each wave period and then by averaging the results over the 4 wave periods according to fig 24 a as sdr increases from 0 333 to 0 5 and 0 75 the average rpt red solid lines sees a linear increase from around 3 to around 7 5 as can be confirmed by the frequency spectrums presented by fig 14 which shows that the amplitude of 2nd order wave harmonics increases as sdr increases from 0 333 to 0 75 indicating a larger velocity influence zone and thus more revolutions the propeller goes through while the average difference blue dotted lines ceases to increase at around 0 036 as the average rpt reaches around 5 and then decreases a little to 0 035 after the average rpt reaches around 7 5 on a smaller scale in fig 24 b as whr increases from 0 6 to 1 0 the average rpt also sees an approximately linear increase from around 4 4 to 5 35 as can be confirmed by fig 17 which shows that the amplitude of 2nd order wave harmonics increases steadily as whr increases from 0 6 to 1 0 at the same time the average difference first experiences a faster increase from 0 031 to 0 037 as the average rpt reaches nearly 4 9 and then increases slowly to 0 0375 as the average rpt reaches nearly 5 35 from the above observations we can roughly conclude for this propeller model in this experiment condition that it takes approximately 5 revolutions in full submergence to regain full thrust which is larger than the value inferred by koushan 2004 4 revolutions from the perspective of this experiment the reason for the overestimation besides that our conclusion is based on a rough estimate is that the previously emerging propeller keeps ventilating as sdr ins reaches or slightly surpasses the border of the velocity influence zone fig 25 left side which is consistent with koushan s 2009 observation that once a propeller in waves starts ventilating in regular waves it will keep ventilating even as submergence depth increases this ventilation can cause a certain amount of thrust loss that in practice delays the thrust regain process hence an overestimation compared to koushan s 2004 inference which considers only the wagner effect according to fig 25 serious ventilation can be clearly observed when the propeller is entering the velocity influence zone left but almost unobservable when leaving the velocity influence zone right the more intense ventilation despite the similar sdr ins around 0 6 and j ins at this two positions to our knowledge results from the upward inclination of propeller slipstream when the propeller is entering the velocity influence zone which enhances the propeller surface interactions specifically an upward inclined inflow velocity results in an upward inclination of propeller slipstream as confirmed by various studies concerning propeller in oblique flow such as dubbioso et al 2013 which is the case for the propeller entering the velocity influence zone in this case the enhanced interactions between the tip vortex system and the free surface result in air entrainment through the tip vortex system causing ventilation on the propeller blades high frequency thrust fluctuation and consequent thrust loss this ventilation mechanism is similar to the one confirmed by califano et al 2011b who identifies the tip vortex as the dominating ventilation system for a propeller with sdr 0 75 to better analyze the high frequency thrust fluctuation from this ventilation using a higher sampling frequency 500 hz to more accurately capture the transients we have re measured the following two test conditions sdr 0 5 0 75 whr 0 8 t 1 0408s j 0 2 fig 26 shows the frequency spectrum of the measured k t under the condition of sdr 0 5 whr 0 8 t 1 0408s j 0 2 one can observe the 1st to 5th harmonics of the wave frequency the 1st shaft frequency 12 hz 4th blade frequency 48 hz and other higher order propeller related harmonics an obvious 32 hz frequency component is also observed because it is neither related to the propeller frequencies nor the wave frequencies it is considered as electric noise and will be eliminated according to koushan 2004 and koushan 2007 for near surface propellers high amplitude thrust fluctuation at blade frequency in this case 48 hz happens due to ventilation or even partial emergence this means that we can identify the ventilation effect on the dynamic loads by analyzing the amplitude of blade frequency thrust fluctuations given this in the data processing we used a low pass filter with a cut off frequency of 55 hz to preserve the blade frequency components with a notch filter between 31 and 33 hz to get rid of the electric noise at 32 hz in addition in order to obtain the absolute thrust fluctuation amplitude the raw data was also filtered with a 3 5 hz low pass filter to preserve only the obvious wave related harmonics for the two test conditions the measured k t time series after filtering both kinds the absolute fluctuation amplitude of k t along with sdr ins based on measured water elevation are shown in figs 27 and 28 from figs 27 and 28 one can observe rather high amplitudes of blade frequency thrust fluctuation mostly in the region of sdr ins 0 6 in which the propeller is basically partially emerging also there is an abrupt increase of thrust fluctuation amplitude at sdr ins 0 6 green arrows this is due to the sudden impact between the blade tip and water surface as the propeller leaves the velocity influence zone see fig 25 right side more importantly even after the propeller enters the velocity influence zone sdr ins 0 6 the propeller is basically fully submerged the blade frequency thrust fluctuation continues to be of relatively high amplitude until sdr ins 0 7 surrounded by red dashed rectangular due to the ventilation even after the propeller enters the velocity influence zone this phenomenon serves as proof that the ventilation after the propeller enters the velocity influence zone causes blade frequency thrust fluctuation given the well established fact that ventilation and consequent thrust fluctuation causes thrust loss we have reason to believe that this ventilation and thrust fluctuation cause certain amount of thrust loss that in practice delays the thrust build up however an accurate and quantitative evaluation of the extent of thrust loss from this ventilation related blade frequency thrust fluctuation is not the main research objective of this paper we can conclude that for a propeller in regular waves undergoing periodical emergence the wagner effect may not be the only reason for the thrust hysteresis the thrust loss and fluctuation should be also considered due to upward slipstream inclination and the consequently enhanced interactions between the tip vortex system and the free surface which happens as the previously emerging propeller heads into full submergence 5 concluding remarks this paper offers an in detail and in depth investigation on the dynamic load characteristics and thrust hysteresis of an open water propeller operating in regular head waves through a series of model experiment conducted in a circulating water channel that involves variant submergence depths wave heights and wave periods conclusions are as follows 1 in regular waves a critical instantaneous submergence depth of around l d 0 6 is identified for this propeller model at j 0 2 once the instantaneous submergence depth surpasses this value the dynamic load characteristics are not dominated by the propeller surface interaction but instead dominated by the periodical variation of inflow velocity also if the instantaneous submergence depth never surpasses or falls below the critical value within a wave period the dynamic load characteristics are basically dominated by the periodical variation of submergence depth or by the periodical variation of inflow velocity 2 for a propeller undergoing periodical emergence with the increase of submergence depth or wave height the periodical variation of inflow velocity has more obvious effect on the dynamic load in the velocity influence zone but the minimum thrust always appears at wave trough due to surface piercing with the increase of wave period the absolute fluctuation amplitude of dynamic load increases in a more obvious manner than full submergence for a propeller in full submergence where the instantaneous submergence depth is always above the critical value with the increase of wave period the absolute fluctuation amplitude of dynamic load decreases instead but in a less obvious manner due to a smaller variation of inflow velocity at a deeper submergence 3 regarding the thrust hysteresis for a propeller undergoing periodical emergence in regular waves according to a rough estimate based on measured data it takes approximately 5 revolutions for this propeller model in full submergence to regain full thrust furthermore wagner effect may not be the only reason for the thrust hysteresis in waves there is also thrust fluctuation and loss due to slipstream upward inclination and the consequently enhanced interactions between the tip vortex system and the free surface which happens as the previously emerging propeller enters full submergence for further improvement of the present study more systematic measurements should be performed at a higher advance ratio j e g 0 6 where ventilation can be very limited in order to evaluate the effect of advance

21277,testing of a 1 6 scale model of an h darrieus cross flow hydrokinetic turbine u s department of energy s reference model 2 river current turbine was conducted in the large towing tank facility at the united states naval academy tests were conducted in current only conditions at a range of diameter based reynolds numbers and at several turbine depths reynolds number independence was observed at or above r e d 1 5 1 0 6 with an associated maximum power coefficient c p of 0 36 at a tip speed ratio t s r of 3 2 turbine performance was shown to be fairly insensitive to turbine tip depth additionally tests were conducted with incident waves in addition to current which were scaled to be large enough to create a shear in velocity across the entire span of the turbine blade the presence of waves degraded power production slightly when compared to the current only case when viewed as a function of turbine angular position the waves were found to amplify or diminish the cyclic signatures in the power measurement depending on the phase difference between the blade angle and wave phase angle as cross flow turbines are proposed to be surface mounted this result suggests that active control strategies may be beneficial in improving power quality keywords h darrieus rm2 river current turbine waves 1 introduction as the imperative to combat global climate change grows increasingly urgent the search for alternative sources of energy even from sources that are not yet economically competitive niebuhr et al 2019 is receiving increased attention brought along by the revolution in wind power over the last several decades hydrokinetic power is also being examined more closely as a source of clean sustainable energy from tides currents and rivers including both axial and cross flow configurations also known as horizontal and vertical axis turbines respectively to spur technological development in this area the u s department of energy s usdoe wind and water power technologies office has created the reference model project rmp to advance the state of marine hydrokinetic technology the rmp includes three hydrokinetic and three wave energy convertor reference models to serve as benchmarks for further study in an effort to better understand the performance and costs of hydrokinetic technology as well as identify important technical obstacles and cost drivers that require additional focus anon 2014 this study focuses on the usdoe reference model 2 rm2 a dual rotor three bladed h darrieus cross flow turbine designed for use in riverine environments barone et al 2011 in the initial experimental results of rm2 hill et al 2014 a site in the lower mississippi river near baton rouge la was given as an example of where such a turbine might be installed in the u s more broadly river current turbines have been installed across the globe since 1978 khan et al 2008 for a comprehensive review of river current energy conversion systems many of which feature h darrieus turbines similar to rm2 khan et al 2008 niebuhr et al 2019 are recommended rm2 shown in fig 1 is designed to be surface mounted floating on two 27 5 m long pontoons that are cable moored and connected via three 19 m long cross bridges the frame proposed to hold the two cross flow rotors extends 9 5 m into the water from the top of the pontoons this design would take advantage of the ability of cross flow turbines to keep power conversion and control components above the water where they are dry and accessible for maintenance each counter rotating rotor is proposed to be 6 5 m in diameter the riverine environment is a particularly challenging environment for hydrokinetic energy extraction in that rivers can have wide variations in flow velocity and depth and can require many years to obtain meaningful statistics describing the hydrodynamic environment jacobson 2012 neary 2011 this uncertainty makes it necessary to study the performance of rm2 and cross flow turbines more broadly under a range of flow conditions among the potential phenomena that will be encountered in situ is wind driven waves a surface condition that results in unsteady velocity shear beneath the free surface it was observed that waves generated by river traffic and wind on the illinois and mississippi rivers reached maximum heights of 0 1 ft 0 03 m to 1 08 ft 0 33 m and calculated maximum significant wave heights for 2 year winds were 1 6 ft 0 49 m for the illinois river and 1 3 ft 0 40 m for the mississippi river bhowmik et al 1982 at these significant wave heights the associated velocity shear would extend along the entire span on the turbine blades the impact of surface waves on cross flow turbine fatigue loading and power quality is not well understood at this time exploration of this potential impact is especially important for floating turbines with rotors operating near the free surface where wave influence is greatest 1 1 performance parameters the tip speed ratio t s r a ratio of the turbine blade tangential speed compared to the mean flow speed is defined as 1 t s r r ω u t o w where r is the turbine radius ω is the rotation speed and u t o w is the mean flow speed i e the speed of the carriage in towing tank tests turbine performance is primarily quantified by the power coefficient c p defined as 2 c p q ω 1 2 ρ u t o w 3 2 r s where q is the torque ρ is the fluid density s is the span i e height of the turbine blades and r is the radius of the turbine d 2 with the frontal area of the turbine being equal to 2 r s the turbine solidity σ or ratio of the total blade planform area to the lateral area of the cylinder swept out by the turbine is a particularly important geometric parameter for cross flow turbines it is defined as 3 σ n c π d where n is the number or blades and c is the blade chord turbine performance is primarily a function of the hydrodynamic characteristics of the blade namely the lift f l and drag f d forces which are related to the angle of attack α and the chord based reynolds number r e c lift and drag are generally presented as non dimensional coefficients c l and c d respectively given as 4 c l f l 1 2 ρ u r e l 2 c s 5 c d f d 1 2 ρ u r e l 2 c s where u r e l is the relative flow speed which incorporates both the mean flow velocity and the tangential velocity of the turbine blade defined as 6 u r e l u t o w 2 r ω 2 as discussed in detail in a later section it is generally accepted that dynamic similarity between a laboratory scale model turbine and the full scale device is achieved through reynolds number equivalence the reynolds number for cross flow turbines is most often defined as r e d u t o w d ν where ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid however as reynolds number equivalence is rarely achievable in a laboratory setting reynolds number independence defined as the minimum reynolds number above which turbine performance is unchanging is generally considered sufficient to permit the comparison of scale models to full scale prototypes neary et al 2012 hill et al 2014 bachant and wosnik 2014 2016 bachant et al 2016 furthermore when considering the impact of scaling on turbine performance it has been shown that the chord based reynolds number defined as r e c u r e l c ν is also a useful parameter as it most accurately represents the state of the flow where reynolds number effects have the most impact on turbine performance 1 2 previous research according to möllerström et al 2019 modern cross flow wind turbines those that produce torque from lift rather than drag are based on an original design by french engineer georges darrieus in the 1920s from france development spread widely with research in canada accelerating during the 1960s and the united states beginning in the 1970s much of current non proprietary experimental work is built upon wind turbine research conducted at sandia national laboratories in the u s which focused on darrieus φ turbine configurations e g blackwell et al 1976 reuter and worstell 1978 sheldahl et al 1980 around this time cross flow turbines were adapted for marine and riverine energy conversion by a number of organizations governmental and commercial employing a variety of different turbine formats all over the world khan et al 2008 also around this time researchers at nihon university in japan published several studies describing h darrieus turbines in marine applications in one study a large three bladed turbine with a diameter and height of 1 6 m was tested in the kurushima straits in southern japan kiho et al 1996 the turbine featured cambered naca 63 3 018 foils with a chord length of 0 3 m classifying it as high solidity σ 0 18 the turbine was tested in flow speeds from 0 8 m s to 1 5 m s and was shown to be reynolds number independent at r e d 1 2 1 6 1 0 6 r e c 6 6 8 9 1 0 5 maximum turbine efficiency of 56 was observed at a t s r of 2 1 in a later study shiono et al 2000 an experiment was conducted in two water channels on a smaller model turbine d 0 3 m s 0 2 m with solidity values varying from 0 108 to 0 537 solidity was changed from experiment to experiment by using blades with differing chord lengths flow speeds were varied from 0 6 to 1 4 m s resulting in r e d ranging from 1 6 t o 3 8 1 0 5 it was shown that two bladed designs are the most efficient at steady operation due to the minimization of flow disturbances experienced by the downstream blade however designs with three or more blades were recommended due to the high starting torque required for two bladed designs they also confirmed that turbine power scales with flow speed cubed and that the generated torque increases with solidity for the range of solidity values tested the observation that increasing blade number decreases turbine efficiency was also observed by kahn iqbal and quaicoe khan et al 2009 in their study three model turbines each with different numbers of blades were tested in a towing tank as the scaling parameters were different for each turbine the effect of solidity on performance could not be isolated it was observed however that turbines with more blades were more likely to be self starting and that the non productive parts of the turbine such as the support arms require design consideration to maximize performance bachant and wosnik 2013 2014 2016 designed a three bladed h darrieus turbine unh rvat for the purpose of investigating reynolds number effects and near wake characteristics i e within 1 d downstream a focus of this research effort was sufficient documentation and measurements so the results of the studies could be used as test cases for numerical model validation the turbine measured 1 m in diameter and height and featured a naca 0020 foil with a 0 14 m chord giving it a solidity of 0 13 in bachant and wosnik 2013 experimental results at r e d 1 0 6 r e c t s r u t o w c ν 2 1 1 0 5 showed a maximum c p of 0 26 corresponding to a t s r of 1 9 mean flow and turbulence measurements were taken in the near wake using acoustic doppler velocimetry with the turbine operating at maximum power production results indicated that the wake was highly three dimensional with the region of high turbulence intensity spread more widely over the center region of the turbine when compared to previous 2 d lower reynolds number studies with the effect increasing with decreasing t s r it was hypothesized that this was the result of more significant blade stall occurring over a larger swept angle for this higher reynolds number case in bachant and wosnik 2014 t s r sweeps were conducted for a wide range of reynolds numbers r e d 0 3 1 3 1 0 6 r e c 0 8 3 4 1 0 5 using the same turbine shown in more detail in bachant and wosnik 2016 and wake velocity measurements are compared to 2 d rans simulations it is shown the turbine becomes reynolds number independent in terms of power coefficient and mean streamwise velocity at r e d 1 0 6 r e c 2 1 0 5 a very small dependence was noted for turbulence intensity and reynolds stresses at these parameters numerical simulations were shown to over predict performance and predict much stronger reynolds number effects than was observed in the experimental results in bachant and wosnik 2016 a detailed wake turbulence analysis indicated that the streamwise momentum and mean kinetic energy achieved reynolds number independence at a similar value as the performance characteristics and it was recommend that scale models reach r e d 1 0 6 to properly model full scale devices two studies have been conducted on scale models of rm2 to date neary et al 2012 and hill et al 2014 tested a 1 15 scale model of rm2 with counter rotating dual rotors in a large open channel facility the experimental conditions produced reynolds numbers based on chord of r e c u c ν 6 1 1 0 4 peak performance occurred at a tip speed ratio of 2 2 yielding a power coefficient of c p 0 05 the small scale turbine and low r e c resulted in significantly reduced lift characteristics of the hydrofoils which lead to small values of c p as compared to tests on larger scale models further reductions in performance may have been due to the chordwise mounting location of the blades which resulted in a small change in pitch angle bachant et al 2016 wake measurements obtained with acoustic doppler velocimeters showed the largest velocity deficit four diameters downstream of the turbine with wake interactions of the dual rotors strongly evident between 3 and 6 diameters downstream of the turbine bachant et al 2016 presented performance characteristics of a 1 6 scale model of rm2 for a range of reynolds numbers based on diameter r e d 0 3 1 3 1 0 6 a peak power coefficient of 0 37 was observed at a tip speed ratio of 3 1 performance characteristics indicated strong reynolds number dependence for less than r e d 1 0 6 and weak dependence for greater than r e d 1 0 6 which corresponded to an average blade chord reynolds number of r e c u t o w c ν 2 1 0 5 similar to bachant and wosnik 2013 and bachant and wosnik 2016 mean flow turbulence intensity and reynolds stress measurements in the near wake within one turbine diameter were also obtained in the study results showed that the wake has less reynolds number dependence than the turbine performance parameters a result similar to that found in bachant and wosnik 2016 few studies have included consideration of cross flow turbine performance in the presence of waves bachant 2011 and bachant and wosnik 2011 investigated the impact of waves on a gorlov helical turbine and showed a general improvement in power performance particularly at higher tsr values with an 11 increase in maximum power coefficient under certain wave conditions though it was not clear why performance improved it was recommended that waves which are a low frequency input to the turbine torque should be taken into consideration when modeling turbines and designing control systems zhang et al 2014 simulated the impact of unsteady hydrodynamic forces on turbine performance using linear waves superimposed on the current and verified the results with an experiment conducted in a circulating water tunnel the hydrokinetic device was a three bladed h type darrieus turbine with c 0 08 m s 1 0 m and a naca 0018 foil section simulations were performed for a current speed of 1 m s a wave period of 10 s a wave height of 1 m and the turbine located 4 m beneath the water surface current only simulations compared favorably with experiments the phase averaged power coefficient for the wave case showed significant variations with c p 0 5 0 25 for peak power conditions in the cycle the high variability in power is due to the fact the turbine has several rotations within one wave period therefore the blades experience increased flow speed while encountering a wave crest and decreased flow speed for a wave trough the study also reports a control scheme to reduce the torque variation and improve power quality under current wave conditions the goal of this study is to better understand the effects of surface waves on cross flow turbines specifically the impact of wave motion on the quantity and quality of power they produce the impact of proximity to the free surface is explored due proposed installation of the turbines on floating pontoons additionally scale independence of the model and model blockage are investigated to further probe the limits of applying model results to full scale turbines 2 materials and methods the present study was conducted in the large towing tank facility in the hydromechanics laboratory of the united states naval academy the towing tank measures 116 m long 7 9 m wide and 4 9 m deep the tank features a dual flap servo controlled wave maker that is capable of producing waves with a maximum amplitude of 0 6 m and a frequency range of 0 25 1 25 hz at the opposite end of the towing tank is a wave absorbing beach which minimizes wave reflection the turbine is a 1 6 scale model of rm2 which is a three bladed h darrieus turbine shown in fig 2 it was designed and commissioned by bachant et al 2016 who include additional specifications details of its manufacture a link to a cad model and associated performance data the pertinent dimensions are reproduced in table 1 for both the proposed full scale turbine and the 1 6 scale model all experimental and data acquisition equipment were mounted to the towing tank carriage the experimental setup is pictured in fig 3 torque was measured using a futek fsh01991 torque sensor with a 200 n m limit mounted in line with the turbine shaft shaft rotation speed and blade position were measured using a bei sensors hs35 incremental optical encoder this sensor was also mounted in line with the turbine shaft and provided a high resolution measurement of turbine rotational speed the encoder counts 3600 pulses per revolution or 10 pulses per degree providing a resolution of 0 1 additionally a single pulse was recorded at a fixed angular position on the drive shaft for absolute position reference surface elevation was measured with a senix tspc 21s 232 optical wave height sensor placed in the same lateral plane as the shaft of the turbine approximately one diameter from the turbine centerline on the starboard side a baldor bsm80n 350af motor and controller were used to control the rotational speed of the turbine and in turn the tip speed ratio measurements included carriage velocity turbine rotation speed torque blade position and surface elevation rm2 as proposed anon 2014 includes a rotor frame into which the turbine rotors are mounted previous studies e g bachant et al 2016 also included this frame measuring the drag force on the frame alone and taring it from the measured results in an effort to isolate the turbine from the support equipment we elected to mount the turbine in a cantilevered configuration as shown in fig 3 as the anticipated shaft vortex shedding frequency predicted by the critical strouhal number s t 2 2 d s h a f t ω u t o w was close to the anticipated blade passage frequency for portions of the t s r range spiral wrap was added to the turbine shaft as shown in fig 2b the torque was measured with the spiral wrap included but with the blades and struts removed at a range of shaft rotation speeds this tare torque was added to the measured torque for all data presented in this study it was intended to measure thrust but due to the size of the turbine and associated loads applied in the cantilevered configuration the turbine had to be rigidly fixed to the towing carriage to preclude significant vibration thus also precluding thrust measurement for all experiments the carriage was towed at a range of speeds between 1 4 and 1 7 m s and data collection lasted for 20 to 30 s per run data collection from all instruments was synchronized and sampled at 1 khz 2 1 wave scaling for axial flow hydrokinetic turbines the unsteady velocities associated with surface waves result in periodic fluctuations of turbine power and thrust that are on the same order of magnitude as the mean power and thrust values e g lust et al 2013 this has significant implications for power quality and fatigue loading how surface waves affect the performance of cross flow turbines particularly h darrieus turbines like rm2 however is not yet well understood as rm2 was designed to be surface mounted as shown in fig 1 it would potentially be impacted to a much greater degree than axial flow turbines which were designed to be installed well beneath the free surface further from the influence of surface waves bir et al 2011 at a hypothetical site with a depth of 10 m a relatively small wave with a significant wave height h of 0 3 m and wavelength λ of 11 5 m corresponding to a period t of 2 7 s would induce a velocity shear in both the horizontal and vertical velocity components of at least 10 cm s along the entire span of the blades the model waves selected for the present study were sized to create such a velocity shear at the given tip depth of 0 35d the wave parameters are detailed in table 2 and the maximum velocity profiles for the streamwise velocity u and the vertical velocity w are shown in fig 4 normalized by the towing carriage speed u t o w the vertical range of the figures is equal to the span vertical height of the turbine and corresponds to the given depth they represent the velocity profiles experienced by the turbine in situ all waves included in table 2 are classified as deep water waves i e h λ 0 5 dean and dalrymple 1991 where h is the depth of the tow tank 4 9 m waves 1 and 2 feature the same wavelength but have different significant wave heights waves 2 and 3 have the same wave height but have different wavelengths because wave energy per unit width 7 e w 1 8 ρ g h 2 λ is a function of both wave height and wavelength all three waves have different energies this was done in an attempt to discern which wave parameter has the more significant impact on performance since the model waves are deep water waves the magnitude of the velocity shear across the span of the turbine is essentially equal in the streamwise and vertical directions as indicated by the similarities between profiles in figs 4a and 4b 2 2 uncertainty analysis an uncertainty analysis was performed using the taylor series method in accordance with iso bipm guidance for uncertainty of measurement gum as described by ratcliffe and ratcliffe 2014 the type b elemental uncertainties included in the analysis were length measurement resolution uncertainty for the radius and span and analog to digital conversion uncertainty for the 16 bit data acquisition system and calibration linearity uncertainty for the carriage speed shaft rotation speed and torque zero offset uncertainty was addressed by measuring the voltage for each of the sampled signals for 10 s with the carriage and the turbine still the average value of the voltage for each signal was then calculated this was taken to be the zero offset voltage for each signal the zero offset voltages were then subtracted from the measured voltage values for each signal this process was repeated for every run the type a elemental uncertainty for carriage and shaft speed were taken to be the standard deviation of the signal unlike axial flow turbines which produce uniform torque over an entire rotation for uniform inflow the torque produced by a cross flow turbine varies considerably over a single rotation i e torque ripple thus the type a uncertainty for the torque signal was calculated as follows first the mean value for each rotation of the turbine was calculated and the standard deviation s of these mean values was calculated the elemental type a uncertainty u a due to random error was then calculated as 8 u a t 1 α 2 n 1 s 2 where t is the student s t statistic for a two tailed distribution quoted at significance level of α with n 1 degrees of freedom where n is the number of rotations in the time history generally 10 or more depending on conditions type a and type b elemental uncertainties were combined for each of the measured parameters and converted to expanded uncertainties u using a k factor of 2 indicating 95 confidence expanded uncertainties for each of the measured values were propagated for each of the calculated quantities these are indicated by the error bars shown on the figures for example at r e d 1 6 1 0 6 t s r 3 3 and c p 0 32 the calculated uncertainty for c p was 3 of the mean value a similar approach to uncertainty analysis was conducted in bachant et al 2016 and bachant and wosnik 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance characteristics steady flow conditions performance characteristics of the model turbine were evaluated over a range of tip speed ratios for a range of reynolds numbers the turbine depth was also varied to investigate the influence of proximity to the free surface on turbine performance results are compared to a similar study using the same turbine at a different facility bachant et al 2016 the presentation of the performance characteristics includes discussion of model scale independence and accounting for model blockage 3 1 1 model scale independence ideally the evaluation of a model turbine under laboratory conditions would achieve complete similitude with the prototype it is meant to represent under anticipated in situ conditions geometric and dynamic similitude are generally achieved by creating a geometrically scaled model turbine and selecting the experimental parameters necessary to achieve kinematic similarity in terms of the tip speed ratio however dynamic similitude requires reynolds number equivalence between the model and prototype which as mentioned previously few experimental facilities can achieve instead reynolds number independence is generally accepted to be sufficient to relate model results to predicted prototype performance neary et al 2012 hill et al 2014 bachant and wosnik 2014 2016 bachant et al 2016 in order to identify the minimum reynolds number required to achieve independence c p was determined for a range of t s r values at increasing values of r e d the reynolds number was increased by increasing the towing carriage speed and adjusting the turbine rotation speed in order to maintain the desired range of t s r values the results are shown in fig 5 for all values of r e d as t s r is increased c p increases to a peak around t s r 3 2 though with increasing r e d the broadening plateau makes a particular peak difficult to discern further increasing t s r results in decreasing c p values due to increasing drag on the blades as r e d increases peak c p increases up to approximately 0 36 at a t s r 3 2 at or slightly above r e d 1 5 1 0 6 above this r e d the peak c p value remains relatively constant indicating reynolds number independence for c p has been achieved this point is highlighted in the insert in fig 5 with the peak c p value plotted as a function of r e d shown with error bars again indicating uncertainty quoted at 95 confidence these results are in good agreement with a previous study of this specific turbine model bachant et al 2016 in terms of peak c p within experimental uncertainty at approximately the same t s r value however in the previous study a strong reynolds number dependence was reported up to r e d 1 1 0 6 whereas the present results suggest that strong reynolds number dependence occurs up to r e d 1 5 1 0 6 with reynolds number independence above this value a higher r e d for scale independence is expected for the present experiment with lower blockage than bachant et al 2016 as predicted by bachant and wosnik 2016 reynolds number independence could be slightly higher for free flows bachant and wosnik addressed the challenges of scaling and reynolds number independence specifically for an h darrieus turbine in two papers bachant and wosnik 2014 2016 they summarize the modes of dependence in two parts first considering a static airfoil the ratio of lift to drag at a particular angle of attack less than the stall angle increases with increasing chord based reynolds number r e c due primarily to the migration of the point along the suction side of the foil at which laminar to turbulent boundary layer transition occurs as this point moves from near the trailing edge to the leading edge more of the foil surface is in the turbulent regime and is thus more likely to remain attached of course the foil of a cross flow turbine is not static as the angle of attack and relative velocity change with turbine angular position thus the second part of their discussion describes the dynamic stall experienced by the turbine particularly at low t s r values the impact of which is noted to be relatively insensitive to r e they recommend a more precise parameter for evaluating independence r e c which provides a more accurate description of the flow dynamics at the point they most impact the performance of the turbine in bachant et al 2016 it was shown that the approximate r e c which marked the transition from strong to weak dependence was approximately 2 1 0 5 roughly corresponding to the turbulent transition point for a flat plate considering that much of the source of reynolds number dependence arises from the behavior of the static foil it is illustrative to consider how r e c the lift coefficient c l and the drag coefficient c d change with turbine angular position the nominal r e c was calculated for one blade based on the average chord length c and the relative velocity as a function of turbine angular position θ using the methodology described in islam et al 2008 and is shown in fig 6a over a single rotation of the turbine r e c is shown to vary considerably fig 6b shows the angle of attack shown as the absolute value for a symmetric foil as a function of the angular position under these conditions α is estimated to remain at or below 18 primarily in the un stalled range fig 6c shows c l solid lines and c d dashed lines for a naca 0021 foil over the expected range of α for a five of r e c values these data were taken from sheldahl and klimas 1981 and indicate that in the reynolds number regime experienced by the turbine under these conditions there is still some significant reynolds number dependence 3 1 2 influence of blockage another issue that arises when testing scale models is how to account for the modified inflow and wake due to flow facility blockage blockage is characterized by the blockage ratio β defined as the frontal area of the turbine i e d s divided by the cross sectional area of the towing tank correcting for blockage is especially important when comparing results from different facilities and predicting turbine performance in free flow conditions to compare results and investigate the influence of blockage results from bachant et al 2016 were plotted on the same set of axes as results from the present study at the same reynolds number r e d 1 1 1 0 6 fig 7 data from bachant et al are shown as filled markers and data from the present study are shown as unfilled markers in bachant et al 2016 the data were not blockage corrected since the results were intended as a test case for computational models it should be noted that this case is right at the threshold of reynolds number independence the performance results do not agree within the bounds of measurement uncertainty the results of the present study are well below that of bachant et al for the same turbine at the same r e d it is also noted that the range of t s r values is significantly smaller in the present study as compared to the previous this is due to the fact that the motor used to control the turbine rotation speed was undersized for t s r values significantly away from peak power production although reasonably consistent the present data shows more variability from one data point to the next compared with the previous study the variability may be partly attributed to the cantilevered mounting design induced vibration particularly at higher reynolds numbers though unobserved at the time of the experiment may have introduced cross axis loading of the torque sensor a key difference between the experimental setups was the blockage in the present study the blockage ratio is 2 2 compared with 9 7 in the previous study bachant et al 2016 a value it should be noted that is still generally assessed as being relatively unblocked additionally higher blockage is often considered acceptable in order to increase the reynolds number several recent papers have been published on the development of effective blockage correction methods kinsey and dumas 2017 jeong et al 2018 ross and polagye 2020 kinsey and dumas investigated channel blockage correction methods for both axial flow and cross flow turbines using unsteady rans simulations at high reynolds number the blockage correction method they describe was developed by barnsley and wellicome 1990 and adapted for marine hydrokinetic turbines by bahaj et al 2007 ross and polagye 2020 conducted an experimental assessment of blockage correction methodologies for both axial and cross flow turbines for cross flow turbines the method that resulted in the closest agreement between blockage corrected and the unblocked performance was developed by houlsby et al 2008 results indicated that the correction was more effective for cross flow than for axial flow turbines and more effective for thrust coefficient than power coefficient using the methodology recommended by ross and polagye a blockage correction was applied to both sets of data the results are shown in fig 7 as inverted triangles as thrust data was not available for the present study the thrust coefficient values for the blocked case were interpolated from the data provided by bachant et al 2016 and used to correct the data from the present study a sensitivity analysis was conducted by increasing and decreasing thrust coefficient values by 10 the error bars shown on the blockage corrected data indicate the sensitivity to the thrust coefficient which was quite small while the agreement for c p between the two studies is quite good within 3 for t s r values at or above peak performance once the blockage correction is applied the results do not agree for the lower values of t s r the performance curve from the present study is slightly narrower and shifted to the right this indicates that while the blockage correction works well for c p it is not able to capture all the complicated flow physics that occurs with a change in t s r interestingly there is very little correction of the bachant et al data for low t s r due to the insensitivity of stall to r e which occurs at low t s r it is also important to note that even at 2 2 blockage the data from the present study are still corrected perceptibly this is illustrated in fig 8 which shows the ratio of uncorrected to corrected values of t s r c t and c p for blockage ratios from 1 to 50 a range covered in kinsey and dumas 2017 jeong et al 2018 and ross and polagye 2020 this analysis was conducted at a representative value at peak c p using the same blockage correction method it shows that the percent increase in c p due to blockage is approximately equal to the blockage ratio itself moreover this illustrates a significant challenge of testing turbines in laboratory conditions namely the trade off between models large enough to achieve r e independence but not so large as to be influenced significantly by blockage 3 1 3 influence of turbine depth turbine performance as a function of blade tip depth was also examined the blade tip depth z t i p is defined as the distance from the free surface to the upper tip of the turbine blades the results are shown in fig 9 for three tip depths from z 0 21 m z t i p d 0 19 to 0 76 m z t i p d 0 70 normalized by the turbine diameter there appears to be little difference between the performance at the deepest and shallowest tip depths as both appear within the same bound of uncertainty observations at the intermediate depth z t i p d 0 35 do appear to show a very slight improvement particularly at higher tip speed ratios turbine blockage may cause acceleration near the free surface increasing the flow speed on the section of the blade near the surface for the z t i p d 0 35 this may be negated for the z t i p d 0 19 case due to other free surface effects overall it seems that there is very little influence of the free surface on turbine performance at these depths particularly near the point of peak power these results indicate that it may not be detrimental to place a turbine near the free surface a positive result for floating turbine systems similar to rm2 bachant and wosnik 2014 characterized the wake behind a cross flow turbine similar to rm2 and found that vertical mean flow is an important transport mechanism in near wake dynamics considering these results turbine proximity to the free surface may prove to be a key parameter when considering wake recovery in turbine arrays 3 2 performance characteristics unsteady flow conditions the influence of surface waves on turbine performance is now investigated results are presented for three deep water wave forms with wave parameters listed in table 2 the ever changing inflow that a turbine blade experiences during one rotation is now further complicated by a horizontal and vertical velocity shear across the span of the blade fig 4 at a wave encounter frequency that is different than the turbine rotation frequency the result is a very complex unsteady flow field 3 2 1 temporal average the effects of unsteady flow conditions due to surface waves on the temporal average power coefficient is compared to steady flow conditions in fig 10 all results presented in the figure have a diameter based reynolds number of r e d 1 6 1 0 6 there appears to be a slight decrease in the power coefficient in the presence of waves compared to the current only case with the peak power coefficient reduced by at most 7 in the case of current and waves the presence of surface waves produced a complicated flow field for the turbine as discussed below and highlighted in fig 10 the rotational rate of the turbine was noticeably inconsistent as each blade passed through a wave crest higher velocity and a wave trough lower velocity the lower velocity conditions combined with segments of the turbine rotation with a high angle of attack to the relative flow potentially increased the incidence of dynamic stall discussed in laneville and vittecoq 1986 as compared to the steady case thus reducing the performance additionally the continual change of turbine rotation rate may have resulted in increased structural vibrations further degrading turbine performance even with these adverse conditions few data points fall outside the bound of measurement uncertainty suggesting that the turbine is largely insensitive to the waves selected for this study at least when quantified by the temporal average bachant and wosnik 2011 experimentally investigated the influence of waves on the performance characteristics of a gorlov type cross flow turbine both power and drag coefficients showed a small increase for the wave cases as compared to the steady flow case additionally the turbine stalled at higher tip speed ratios in waves than in steady flow this again highlights the complicated flow conditions with surface waves the helical shaped gorlov turbine blades may be less susceptible to performance degradation from velocity shear as compared to the straight darrieus h type turbine blades 3 2 2 turbine angular position phase average plotting the power coefficient as a function of the turbine angular position θ t shown in fig 11 provides a more interesting perspective on the impact of waves on turbine performance for reference θ t 0 is when the reference blade chord is parallel to the incoming flow i e the 3 o clock position when viewed from above with incoming flow from the 12 o clock position the second blade is oriented parallel to the flow when θ t 12 0 and the third when θ t 24 0 under current only conditions plotted as gray symbols on figs 11a c and e the relative velocity experienced by a single blade varies significantly with turbine angular position as shown in fig 6a each complete rotation of the turbine features three torque peaks one for each of the three turbine blades during the portion of the rotation when one blade is most productive the other two blades are potentially less productive or can even produce torque in the opposite direction depending on the conditions small asymmetries between peaks are evident likely artifacts of assembly or manufacturing there is also a larger range of measured values at the peaks and troughs of the power coefficient curve quantified as the standard deviation and shown in figs 11b d and f the current only case has been included for comparison to the current and wave case and has been phase shifted in figs 11a c and e only so as not to obscure the current and wave case results the current and wave case is shown in each of figs 11a c e as colored symbols which correspond to the wave phase angle θ w at the turbine shaft at the time of observation dark blue and dark red symbols indicating the wave crest θ w 0 36 0 and green symbols indicating the wave trough θ w 18 0 the wave phase angle was determined by fitting a sine wave to the surface elevation measurements using a nonlinear least squares fit algorithm the fit function has the form η h 2 cos ω e t θ w where η is the free surface elevation and ω e is the encounter frequency of the wave the encounter frequency is defined as ω e ω 0 ω 0 2 u t o w g for a turbine advancing directly into oncoming waves here ω 0 is the wave angular frequency without the influence of a current equal to 2 π t where t is the wave period data for both the current only and the current and wave cases were divided into 1 bins by turbine angle at the time of observation the mean power coefficient value for each of these bins was calculated with approximately 20 data points per bin and are represented by the black symbols the peak bin averaged power coefficient appears to be slightly reduced in the presence of waves compared to the current only case this is in agreement with the results shown in fig 10 close inspection shows that particularly at the peaks of the power coefficient curves the range of power coefficient values is larger in the current and wave case than it is for the current only case it is also notable that the observations above the bin average curve are colored dark blue and dark red associated with wave crest passage and maximum streamwise velocity and observations below the bin average curve are colored light blue green and yellow associated with wave trough passage and minimum streamwise velocity for figs 11a and c to quantify the difference between the current only and the wave and current cases the bin standard deviation was plotted as a function of turbine angular position and is shown in fig 11b d and f again the gray symbols represent the current only case the black symbols represent the current and wave case for each respective wave the bin standard deviations for the current only s c and current and wave s c w cases were normalized by the overall mean of the bin standard deviations for the current only case 9 s c 1 n i 1 n s c i where n is the number of bins and s c i is the standard deviation for an individual bin this is intended to provide a relative comparison between the current only and current and wave cases in the case of wave 1 versus wave 2 both waves having the same period t 1 5 s and wave 2 having a height 50 taller than wave 1 h 0 15 m versus 0 10 m the results shown in figs 11b and d are as one might expect the effect of the wave is that the standard deviation near the peak of the power coefficient curve increases denoting a wider range of measurements with the power related to the cube of the relative velocity shown in eq 2 small flow field variations can have significant impacts it should also be noted that wave 2 which is larger and therefore more energetic has a slightly larger impact in terms of power variation however comparing wave 2 and 3 both having the same height h 0 15 m but with wave 3 having a slightly shorter period t 1 2 s compared with wave 2 t 1 5 s the difference is dramatic fig 11f shows almost no difference between the bin standard deviation of the current only and current and wave cases this difference is investigated further in fig 12 fig 12 is a magnification of the area enclosed by the gray dashed line rectangles shown in figs 11a c and e in fig 12a and b the data are comparatively ordered meaning that when the advancing blade encounters a wave crest the result is a larger than average power output likewise when the advancing blade encounters a wave trough the result is a smaller than average power output thought of another way there appears to be a degree of constructive synchronization between the encounter frequency of the wave and the rotation frequency of the turbine on the other hand the data in fig 12c show significantly less order when the advancing blade encounters a wave crest the result is not necessarily an above average power output indicating that the adverse effects on one or both of the other blades must be larger in the case of wave 3 than with waves 1 or 2 the result is a markedly narrower band of power coefficient observations and thus a smaller bin standard deviation though not shown this was true for all other observations under these wave conditions further study will be required to understand the relationship between the wave encounter frequency and the turbine rotation frequency but this result highlights the potential for control schemes that could minimize wave impact and maximize power forbush et al 2017 4 conclusions a 1 6 scale model of the u s department of energy s reference model 2 riverine hydrokinetic turbine was tested in the large towing tank facility at the u s naval academy turbine performance was evaluated over a range of tip speed ratios and diameter based reynolds numbers these results were compared to previous observations made of the same model turbine the impact of tip depth on turbine performance was also examined under current only conditions finally the impact of surface waves on turbine performance was investigated in current only conditions c p was calculated for a range of t s r values from 2 5 to 4 5 at diameter based reynolds numbers from 1 1 to 1 8 1 0 6 r e c 1 8 3 0 1 0 5 reynolds number independence as indicated by a consistent c p was observed at or above r e d 1 5 1 0 6 with c p 0 36 at t s r 3 2 these performance results agree with previous observations made by bachant et al 2016 within the bounds of measurement uncertainty although the dependence threshold for the present study is slightly higher than was observed in the previous study the difference is thought to be due in part to blockage which was 2 2 for the present study and 9 7 for bachant et al when corrected for blockage using the methodology developed by houlsby et al 2008 the results for the two facilities on the same model at the same approximate reynolds number are shown to be in reasonable agreement moreover it is estimated that even at this relatively large geometric scale a portion of the blade may still be in the slightly reynolds number dependent regime as the turbine is intended to be surface mounted performance in terms of power coefficient over a range of tip speed ratios was assessed at three different depths z t i p d equal to 0 19 0 35 and 0 70 although there was some statistically significant variation between depths at higher tip speed ratios near the point of peak performance there was little notable difference suggesting the turbine to be fairly insensitive to free surface effects at least within the range of depths tested turbine performance was also examined in the presence of three model waves all scaled to provide velocity shear over the entire span of the blade at the installed depth of the three waves two waves had the same wavelengths but different significant wave heights and two waves had the same significant wave heights but different wavelengths this was done in an effort to discern how the individual wave parameters affect performance the presence of waves appeared to degrade the temporal average power coefficient of the turbine slightly outside the bound of uncertainty but in all cases less than 7 this suggests that at least for the conditions of the present experiment the turbine is fairly insensitive to waves this is only a preliminary finding however and further more comprehensive testing will be required to properly illuminate the relationship between turbines and the range of waves they may potentially encounter when plotted as a function of turbine angular position the coefficient of power is shown to be highly periodic with a peak for each turbine blade results were compared between the current only and current and wave cases the slight degradation of the current and wave case as compared to the current only case is clearly shown in the case of current and waves there is more variation in the power produced near the point of peak power production compared to the current only case and this variation was shown to increase with wave height and therefore energy for one set of waves however the results for another wave with a different wave period showed almost no change at all between the two cases indicating that there is likely significant opportunity for active control measures to reduce the impact of waves on turbine power and likely also fatigue loading credit authorship contribution statement ethan e lust validation data curation visualization writing review editing supervision

21277,testing of a 1 6 scale model of an h darrieus cross flow hydrokinetic turbine u s department of energy s reference model 2 river current turbine was conducted in the large towing tank facility at the united states naval academy tests were conducted in current only conditions at a range of diameter based reynolds numbers and at several turbine depths reynolds number independence was observed at or above r e d 1 5 1 0 6 with an associated maximum power coefficient c p of 0 36 at a tip speed ratio t s r of 3 2 turbine performance was shown to be fairly insensitive to turbine tip depth additionally tests were conducted with incident waves in addition to current which were scaled to be large enough to create a shear in velocity across the entire span of the turbine blade the presence of waves degraded power production slightly when compared to the current only case when viewed as a function of turbine angular position the waves were found to amplify or diminish the cyclic signatures in the power measurement depending on the phase difference between the blade angle and wave phase angle as cross flow turbines are proposed to be surface mounted this result suggests that active control strategies may be beneficial in improving power quality keywords h darrieus rm2 river current turbine waves 1 introduction as the imperative to combat global climate change grows increasingly urgent the search for alternative sources of energy even from sources that are not yet economically competitive niebuhr et al 2019 is receiving increased attention brought along by the revolution in wind power over the last several decades hydrokinetic power is also being examined more closely as a source of clean sustainable energy from tides currents and rivers including both axial and cross flow configurations also known as horizontal and vertical axis turbines respectively to spur technological development in this area the u s department of energy s usdoe wind and water power technologies office has created the reference model project rmp to advance the state of marine hydrokinetic technology the rmp includes three hydrokinetic and three wave energy convertor reference models to serve as benchmarks for further study in an effort to better understand the performance and costs of hydrokinetic technology as well as identify important technical obstacles and cost drivers that require additional focus anon 2014 this study focuses on the usdoe reference model 2 rm2 a dual rotor three bladed h darrieus cross flow turbine designed for use in riverine environments barone et al 2011 in the initial experimental results of rm2 hill et al 2014 a site in the lower mississippi river near baton rouge la was given as an example of where such a turbine might be installed in the u s more broadly river current turbines have been installed across the globe since 1978 khan et al 2008 for a comprehensive review of river current energy conversion systems many of which feature h darrieus turbines similar to rm2 khan et al 2008 niebuhr et al 2019 are recommended rm2 shown in fig 1 is designed to be surface mounted floating on two 27 5 m long pontoons that are cable moored and connected via three 19 m long cross bridges the frame proposed to hold the two cross flow rotors extends 9 5 m into the water from the top of the pontoons this design would take advantage of the ability of cross flow turbines to keep power conversion and control components above the water where they are dry and accessible for maintenance each counter rotating rotor is proposed to be 6 5 m in diameter the riverine environment is a particularly challenging environment for hydrokinetic energy extraction in that rivers can have wide variations in flow velocity and depth and can require many years to obtain meaningful statistics describing the hydrodynamic environment jacobson 2012 neary 2011 this uncertainty makes it necessary to study the performance of rm2 and cross flow turbines more broadly under a range of flow conditions among the potential phenomena that will be encountered in situ is wind driven waves a surface condition that results in unsteady velocity shear beneath the free surface it was observed that waves generated by river traffic and wind on the illinois and mississippi rivers reached maximum heights of 0 1 ft 0 03 m to 1 08 ft 0 33 m and calculated maximum significant wave heights for 2 year winds were 1 6 ft 0 49 m for the illinois river and 1 3 ft 0 40 m for the mississippi river bhowmik et al 1982 at these significant wave heights the associated velocity shear would extend along the entire span on the turbine blades the impact of surface waves on cross flow turbine fatigue loading and power quality is not well understood at this time exploration of this potential impact is especially important for floating turbines with rotors operating near the free surface where wave influence is greatest 1 1 performance parameters the tip speed ratio t s r a ratio of the turbine blade tangential speed compared to the mean flow speed is defined as 1 t s r r ω u t o w where r is the turbine radius ω is the rotation speed and u t o w is the mean flow speed i e the speed of the carriage in towing tank tests turbine performance is primarily quantified by the power coefficient c p defined as 2 c p q ω 1 2 ρ u t o w 3 2 r s where q is the torque ρ is the fluid density s is the span i e height of the turbine blades and r is the radius of the turbine d 2 with the frontal area of the turbine being equal to 2 r s the turbine solidity σ or ratio of the total blade planform area to the lateral area of the cylinder swept out by the turbine is a particularly important geometric parameter for cross flow turbines it is defined as 3 σ n c π d where n is the number or blades and c is the blade chord turbine performance is primarily a function of the hydrodynamic characteristics of the blade namely the lift f l and drag f d forces which are related to the angle of attack α and the chord based reynolds number r e c lift and drag are generally presented as non dimensional coefficients c l and c d respectively given as 4 c l f l 1 2 ρ u r e l 2 c s 5 c d f d 1 2 ρ u r e l 2 c s where u r e l is the relative flow speed which incorporates both the mean flow velocity and the tangential velocity of the turbine blade defined as 6 u r e l u t o w 2 r ω 2 as discussed in detail in a later section it is generally accepted that dynamic similarity between a laboratory scale model turbine and the full scale device is achieved through reynolds number equivalence the reynolds number for cross flow turbines is most often defined as r e d u t o w d ν where ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid however as reynolds number equivalence is rarely achievable in a laboratory setting reynolds number independence defined as the minimum reynolds number above which turbine performance is unchanging is generally considered sufficient to permit the comparison of scale models to full scale prototypes neary et al 2012 hill et al 2014 bachant and wosnik 2014 2016 bachant et al 2016 furthermore when considering the impact of scaling on turbine performance it has been shown that the chord based reynolds number defined as r e c u r e l c ν is also a useful parameter as it most accurately represents the state of the flow where reynolds number effects have the most impact on turbine performance 1 2 previous research according to möllerström et al 2019 modern cross flow wind turbines those that produce torque from lift rather than drag are based on an original design by french engineer georges darrieus in the 1920s from france development spread widely with research in canada accelerating during the 1960s and the united states beginning in the 1970s much of current non proprietary experimental work is built upon wind turbine research conducted at sandia national laboratories in the u s which focused on darrieus φ turbine configurations e g blackwell et al 1976 reuter and worstell 1978 sheldahl et al 1980 around this time cross flow turbines were adapted for marine and riverine energy conversion by a number of organizations governmental and commercial employing a variety of different turbine formats all over the world khan et al 2008 also around this time researchers at nihon university in japan published several studies describing h darrieus turbines in marine applications in one study a large three bladed turbine with a diameter and height of 1 6 m was tested in the kurushima straits in southern japan kiho et al 1996 the turbine featured cambered naca 63 3 018 foils with a chord length of 0 3 m classifying it as high solidity σ 0 18 the turbine was tested in flow speeds from 0 8 m s to 1 5 m s and was shown to be reynolds number independent at r e d 1 2 1 6 1 0 6 r e c 6 6 8 9 1 0 5 maximum turbine efficiency of 56 was observed at a t s r of 2 1 in a later study shiono et al 2000 an experiment was conducted in two water channels on a smaller model turbine d 0 3 m s 0 2 m with solidity values varying from 0 108 to 0 537 solidity was changed from experiment to experiment by using blades with differing chord lengths flow speeds were varied from 0 6 to 1 4 m s resulting in r e d ranging from 1 6 t o 3 8 1 0 5 it was shown that two bladed designs are the most efficient at steady operation due to the minimization of flow disturbances experienced by the downstream blade however designs with three or more blades were recommended due to the high starting torque required for two bladed designs they also confirmed that turbine power scales with flow speed cubed and that the generated torque increases with solidity for the range of solidity values tested the observation that increasing blade number decreases turbine efficiency was also observed by kahn iqbal and quaicoe khan et al 2009 in their study three model turbines each with different numbers of blades were tested in a towing tank as the scaling parameters were different for each turbine the effect of solidity on performance could not be isolated it was observed however that turbines with more blades were more likely to be self starting and that the non productive parts of the turbine such as the support arms require design consideration to maximize performance bachant and wosnik 2013 2014 2016 designed a three bladed h darrieus turbine unh rvat for the purpose of investigating reynolds number effects and near wake characteristics i e within 1 d downstream a focus of this research effort was sufficient documentation and measurements so the results of the studies could be used as test cases for numerical model validation the turbine measured 1 m in diameter and height and featured a naca 0020 foil with a 0 14 m chord giving it a solidity of 0 13 in bachant and wosnik 2013 experimental results at r e d 1 0 6 r e c t s r u t o w c ν 2 1 1 0 5 showed a maximum c p of 0 26 corresponding to a t s r of 1 9 mean flow and turbulence measurements were taken in the near wake using acoustic doppler velocimetry with the turbine operating at maximum power production results indicated that the wake was highly three dimensional with the region of high turbulence intensity spread more widely over the center region of the turbine when compared to previous 2 d lower reynolds number studies with the effect increasing with decreasing t s r it was hypothesized that this was the result of more significant blade stall occurring over a larger swept angle for this higher reynolds number case in bachant and wosnik 2014 t s r sweeps were conducted for a wide range of reynolds numbers r e d 0 3 1 3 1 0 6 r e c 0 8 3 4 1 0 5 using the same turbine shown in more detail in bachant and wosnik 2016 and wake velocity measurements are compared to 2 d rans simulations it is shown the turbine becomes reynolds number independent in terms of power coefficient and mean streamwise velocity at r e d 1 0 6 r e c 2 1 0 5 a very small dependence was noted for turbulence intensity and reynolds stresses at these parameters numerical simulations were shown to over predict performance and predict much stronger reynolds number effects than was observed in the experimental results in bachant and wosnik 2016 a detailed wake turbulence analysis indicated that the streamwise momentum and mean kinetic energy achieved reynolds number independence at a similar value as the performance characteristics and it was recommend that scale models reach r e d 1 0 6 to properly model full scale devices two studies have been conducted on scale models of rm2 to date neary et al 2012 and hill et al 2014 tested a 1 15 scale model of rm2 with counter rotating dual rotors in a large open channel facility the experimental conditions produced reynolds numbers based on chord of r e c u c ν 6 1 1 0 4 peak performance occurred at a tip speed ratio of 2 2 yielding a power coefficient of c p 0 05 the small scale turbine and low r e c resulted in significantly reduced lift characteristics of the hydrofoils which lead to small values of c p as compared to tests on larger scale models further reductions in performance may have been due to the chordwise mounting location of the blades which resulted in a small change in pitch angle bachant et al 2016 wake measurements obtained with acoustic doppler velocimeters showed the largest velocity deficit four diameters downstream of the turbine with wake interactions of the dual rotors strongly evident between 3 and 6 diameters downstream of the turbine bachant et al 2016 presented performance characteristics of a 1 6 scale model of rm2 for a range of reynolds numbers based on diameter r e d 0 3 1 3 1 0 6 a peak power coefficient of 0 37 was observed at a tip speed ratio of 3 1 performance characteristics indicated strong reynolds number dependence for less than r e d 1 0 6 and weak dependence for greater than r e d 1 0 6 which corresponded to an average blade chord reynolds number of r e c u t o w c ν 2 1 0 5 similar to bachant and wosnik 2013 and bachant and wosnik 2016 mean flow turbulence intensity and reynolds stress measurements in the near wake within one turbine diameter were also obtained in the study results showed that the wake has less reynolds number dependence than the turbine performance parameters a result similar to that found in bachant and wosnik 2016 few studies have included consideration of cross flow turbine performance in the presence of waves bachant 2011 and bachant and wosnik 2011 investigated the impact of waves on a gorlov helical turbine and showed a general improvement in power performance particularly at higher tsr values with an 11 increase in maximum power coefficient under certain wave conditions though it was not clear why performance improved it was recommended that waves which are a low frequency input to the turbine torque should be taken into consideration when modeling turbines and designing control systems zhang et al 2014 simulated the impact of unsteady hydrodynamic forces on turbine performance using linear waves superimposed on the current and verified the results with an experiment conducted in a circulating water tunnel the hydrokinetic device was a three bladed h type darrieus turbine with c 0 08 m s 1 0 m and a naca 0018 foil section simulations were performed for a current speed of 1 m s a wave period of 10 s a wave height of 1 m and the turbine located 4 m beneath the water surface current only simulations compared favorably with experiments the phase averaged power coefficient for the wave case showed significant variations with c p 0 5 0 25 for peak power conditions in the cycle the high variability in power is due to the fact the turbine has several rotations within one wave period therefore the blades experience increased flow speed while encountering a wave crest and decreased flow speed for a wave trough the study also reports a control scheme to reduce the torque variation and improve power quality under current wave conditions the goal of this study is to better understand the effects of surface waves on cross flow turbines specifically the impact of wave motion on the quantity and quality of power they produce the impact of proximity to the free surface is explored due proposed installation of the turbines on floating pontoons additionally scale independence of the model and model blockage are investigated to further probe the limits of applying model results to full scale turbines 2 materials and methods the present study was conducted in the large towing tank facility in the hydromechanics laboratory of the united states naval academy the towing tank measures 116 m long 7 9 m wide and 4 9 m deep the tank features a dual flap servo controlled wave maker that is capable of producing waves with a maximum amplitude of 0 6 m and a frequency range of 0 25 1 25 hz at the opposite end of the towing tank is a wave absorbing beach which minimizes wave reflection the turbine is a 1 6 scale model of rm2 which is a three bladed h darrieus turbine shown in fig 2 it was designed and commissioned by bachant et al 2016 who include additional specifications details of its manufacture a link to a cad model and associated performance data the pertinent dimensions are reproduced in table 1 for both the proposed full scale turbine and the 1 6 scale model all experimental and data acquisition equipment were mounted to the towing tank carriage the experimental setup is pictured in fig 3 torque was measured using a futek fsh01991 torque sensor with a 200 n m limit mounted in line with the turbine shaft shaft rotation speed and blade position were measured using a bei sensors hs35 incremental optical encoder this sensor was also mounted in line with the turbine shaft and provided a high resolution measurement of turbine rotational speed the encoder counts 3600 pulses per revolution or 10 pulses per degree providing a resolution of 0 1 additionally a single pulse was recorded at a fixed angular position on the drive shaft for absolute position reference surface elevation was measured with a senix tspc 21s 232 optical wave height sensor placed in the same lateral plane as the shaft of the turbine approximately one diameter from the turbine centerline on the starboard side a baldor bsm80n 350af motor and controller were used to control the rotational speed of the turbine and in turn the tip speed ratio measurements included carriage velocity turbine rotation speed torque blade position and surface elevation rm2 as proposed anon 2014 includes a rotor frame into which the turbine rotors are mounted previous studies e g bachant et al 2016 also included this frame measuring the drag force on the frame alone and taring it from the measured results in an effort to isolate the turbine from the support equipment we elected to mount the turbine in a cantilevered configuration as shown in fig 3 as the anticipated shaft vortex shedding frequency predicted by the critical strouhal number s t 2 2 d s h a f t ω u t o w was close to the anticipated blade passage frequency for portions of the t s r range spiral wrap was added to the turbine shaft as shown in fig 2b the torque was measured with the spiral wrap included but with the blades and struts removed at a range of shaft rotation speeds this tare torque was added to the measured torque for all data presented in this study it was intended to measure thrust but due to the size of the turbine and associated loads applied in the cantilevered configuration the turbine had to be rigidly fixed to the towing carriage to preclude significant vibration thus also precluding thrust measurement for all experiments the carriage was towed at a range of speeds between 1 4 and 1 7 m s and data collection lasted for 20 to 30 s per run data collection from all instruments was synchronized and sampled at 1 khz 2 1 wave scaling for axial flow hydrokinetic turbines the unsteady velocities associated with surface waves result in periodic fluctuations of turbine power and thrust that are on the same order of magnitude as the mean power and thrust values e g lust et al 2013 this has significant implications for power quality and fatigue loading how surface waves affect the performance of cross flow turbines particularly h darrieus turbines like rm2 however is not yet well understood as rm2 was designed to be surface mounted as shown in fig 1 it would potentially be impacted to a much greater degree than axial flow turbines which were designed to be installed well beneath the free surface further from the influence of surface waves bir et al 2011 at a hypothetical site with a depth of 10 m a relatively small wave with a significant wave height h of 0 3 m and wavelength λ of 11 5 m corresponding to a period t of 2 7 s would induce a velocity shear in both the horizontal and vertical velocity components of at least 10 cm s along the entire span of the blades the model waves selected for the present study were sized to create such a velocity shear at the given tip depth of 0 35d the wave parameters are detailed in table 2 and the maximum velocity profiles for the streamwise velocity u and the vertical velocity w are shown in fig 4 normalized by the towing carriage speed u t o w the vertical range of the figures is equal to the span vertical height of the turbine and corresponds to the given depth they represent the velocity profiles experienced by the turbine in situ all waves included in table 2 are classified as deep water waves i e h λ 0 5 dean and dalrymple 1991 where h is the depth of the tow tank 4 9 m waves 1 and 2 feature the same wavelength but have different significant wave heights waves 2 and 3 have the same wave height but have different wavelengths because wave energy per unit width 7 e w 1 8 ρ g h 2 λ is a function of both wave height and wavelength all three waves have different energies this was done in an attempt to discern which wave parameter has the more significant impact on performance since the model waves are deep water waves the magnitude of the velocity shear across the span of the turbine is essentially equal in the streamwise and vertical directions as indicated by the similarities between profiles in figs 4a and 4b 2 2 uncertainty analysis an uncertainty analysis was performed using the taylor series method in accordance with iso bipm guidance for uncertainty of measurement gum as described by ratcliffe and ratcliffe 2014 the type b elemental uncertainties included in the analysis were length measurement resolution uncertainty for the radius and span and analog to digital conversion uncertainty for the 16 bit data acquisition system and calibration linearity uncertainty for the carriage speed shaft rotation speed and torque zero offset uncertainty was addressed by measuring the voltage for each of the sampled signals for 10 s with the carriage and the turbine still the average value of the voltage for each signal was then calculated this was taken to be the zero offset voltage for each signal the zero offset voltages were then subtracted from the measured voltage values for each signal this process was repeated for every run the type a elemental uncertainty for carriage and shaft speed were taken to be the standard deviation of the signal unlike axial flow turbines which produce uniform torque over an entire rotation for uniform inflow the torque produced by a cross flow turbine varies considerably over a single rotation i e torque ripple thus the type a uncertainty for the torque signal was calculated as follows first the mean value for each rotation of the turbine was calculated and the standard deviation s of these mean values was calculated the elemental type a uncertainty u a due to random error was then calculated as 8 u a t 1 α 2 n 1 s 2 where t is the student s t statistic for a two tailed distribution quoted at significance level of α with n 1 degrees of freedom where n is the number of rotations in the time history generally 10 or more depending on conditions type a and type b elemental uncertainties were combined for each of the measured parameters and converted to expanded uncertainties u using a k factor of 2 indicating 95 confidence expanded uncertainties for each of the measured values were propagated for each of the calculated quantities these are indicated by the error bars shown on the figures for example at r e d 1 6 1 0 6 t s r 3 3 and c p 0 32 the calculated uncertainty for c p was 3 of the mean value a similar approach to uncertainty analysis was conducted in bachant et al 2016 and bachant and wosnik 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance characteristics steady flow conditions performance characteristics of the model turbine were evaluated over a range of tip speed ratios for a range of reynolds numbers the turbine depth was also varied to investigate the influence of proximity to the free surface on turbine performance results are compared to a similar study using the same turbine at a different facility bachant et al 2016 the presentation of the performance characteristics includes discussion of model scale independence and accounting for model blockage 3 1 1 model scale independence ideally the evaluation of a model turbine under laboratory conditions would achieve complete similitude with the prototype it is meant to represent under anticipated in situ conditions geometric and dynamic similitude are generally achieved by creating a geometrically scaled model turbine and selecting the experimental parameters necessary to achieve kinematic similarity in terms of the tip speed ratio however dynamic similitude requires reynolds number equivalence between the model and prototype which as mentioned previously few experimental facilities can achieve instead reynolds number independence is generally accepted to be sufficient to relate model results to predicted prototype performance neary et al 2012 hill et al 2014 bachant and wosnik 2014 2016 bachant et al 2016 in order to identify the minimum reynolds number required to achieve independence c p was determined for a range of t s r values at increasing values of r e d the reynolds number was increased by increasing the towing carriage speed and adjusting the turbine rotation speed in order to maintain the desired range of t s r values the results are shown in fig 5 for all values of r e d as t s r is increased c p increases to a peak around t s r 3 2 though with increasing r e d the broadening plateau makes a particular peak difficult to discern further increasing t s r results in decreasing c p values due to increasing drag on the blades as r e d increases peak c p increases up to approximately 0 36 at a t s r 3 2 at or slightly above r e d 1 5 1 0 6 above this r e d the peak c p value remains relatively constant indicating reynolds number independence for c p has been achieved this point is highlighted in the insert in fig 5 with the peak c p value plotted as a function of r e d shown with error bars again indicating uncertainty quoted at 95 confidence these results are in good agreement with a previous study of this specific turbine model bachant et al 2016 in terms of peak c p within experimental uncertainty at approximately the same t s r value however in the previous study a strong reynolds number dependence was reported up to r e d 1 1 0 6 whereas the present results suggest that strong reynolds number dependence occurs up to r e d 1 5 1 0 6 with reynolds number independence above this value a higher r e d for scale independence is expected for the present experiment with lower blockage than bachant et al 2016 as predicted by bachant and wosnik 2016 reynolds number independence could be slightly higher for free flows bachant and wosnik addressed the challenges of scaling and reynolds number independence specifically for an h darrieus turbine in two papers bachant and wosnik 2014 2016 they summarize the modes of dependence in two parts first considering a static airfoil the ratio of lift to drag at a particular angle of attack less than the stall angle increases with increasing chord based reynolds number r e c due primarily to the migration of the point along the suction side of the foil at which laminar to turbulent boundary layer transition occurs as this point moves from near the trailing edge to the leading edge more of the foil surface is in the turbulent regime and is thus more likely to remain attached of course the foil of a cross flow turbine is not static as the angle of attack and relative velocity change with turbine angular position thus the second part of their discussion describes the dynamic stall experienced by the turbine particularly at low t s r values the impact of which is noted to be relatively insensitive to r e they recommend a more precise parameter for evaluating independence r e c which provides a more accurate description of the flow dynamics at the point they most impact the performance of the turbine in bachant et al 2016 it was shown that the approximate r e c which marked the transition from strong to weak dependence was approximately 2 1 0 5 roughly corresponding to the turbulent transition point for a flat plate considering that much of the source of reynolds number dependence arises from the behavior of the static foil it is illustrative to consider how r e c the lift coefficient c l and the drag coefficient c d change with turbine angular position the nominal r e c was calculated for one blade based on the average chord length c and the relative velocity as a function of turbine angular position θ using the methodology described in islam et al 2008 and is shown in fig 6a over a single rotation of the turbine r e c is shown to vary considerably fig 6b shows the angle of attack shown as the absolute value for a symmetric foil as a function of the angular position under these conditions α is estimated to remain at or below 18 primarily in the un stalled range fig 6c shows c l solid lines and c d dashed lines for a naca 0021 foil over the expected range of α for a five of r e c values these data were taken from sheldahl and klimas 1981 and indicate that in the reynolds number regime experienced by the turbine under these conditions there is still some significant reynolds number dependence 3 1 2 influence of blockage another issue that arises when testing scale models is how to account for the modified inflow and wake due to flow facility blockage blockage is characterized by the blockage ratio β defined as the frontal area of the turbine i e d s divided by the cross sectional area of the towing tank correcting for blockage is especially important when comparing results from different facilities and predicting turbine performance in free flow conditions to compare results and investigate the influence of blockage results from bachant et al 2016 were plotted on the same set of axes as results from the present study at the same reynolds number r e d 1 1 1 0 6 fig 7 data from bachant et al are shown as filled markers and data from the present study are shown as unfilled markers in bachant et al 2016 the data were not blockage corrected since the results were intended as a test case for computational models it should be noted that this case is right at the threshold of reynolds number independence the performance results do not agree within the bounds of measurement uncertainty the results of the present study are well below that of bachant et al for the same turbine at the same r e d it is also noted that the range of t s r values is significantly smaller in the present study as compared to the previous this is due to the fact that the motor used to control the turbine rotation speed was undersized for t s r values significantly away from peak power production although reasonably consistent the present data shows more variability from one data point to the next compared with the previous study the variability may be partly attributed to the cantilevered mounting design induced vibration particularly at higher reynolds numbers though unobserved at the time of the experiment may have introduced cross axis loading of the torque sensor a key difference between the experimental setups was the blockage in the present study the blockage ratio is 2 2 compared with 9 7 in the previous study bachant et al 2016 a value it should be noted that is still generally assessed as being relatively unblocked additionally higher blockage is often considered acceptable in order to increase the reynolds number several recent papers have been published on the development of effective blockage correction methods kinsey and dumas 2017 jeong et al 2018 ross and polagye 2020 kinsey and dumas investigated channel blockage correction methods for both axial flow and cross flow turbines using unsteady rans simulations at high reynolds number the blockage correction method they describe was developed by barnsley and wellicome 1990 and adapted for marine hydrokinetic turbines by bahaj et al 2007 ross and polagye 2020 conducted an experimental assessment of blockage correction methodologies for both axial and cross flow turbines for cross flow turbines the method that resulted in the closest agreement between blockage corrected and the unblocked performance was developed by houlsby et al 2008 results indicated that the correction was more effective for cross flow than for axial flow turbines and more effective for thrust coefficient than power coefficient using the methodology recommended by ross and polagye a blockage correction was applied to both sets of data the results are shown in fig 7 as inverted triangles as thrust data was not available for the present study the thrust coefficient values for the blocked case were interpolated from the data provided by bachant et al 2016 and used to correct the data from the present study a sensitivity analysis was conducted by increasing and decreasing thrust coefficient values by 10 the error bars shown on the blockage corrected data indicate the sensitivity to the thrust coefficient which was quite small while the agreement for c p between the two studies is quite good within 3 for t s r values at or above peak performance once the blockage correction is applied the results do not agree for the lower values of t s r the performance curve from the present study is slightly narrower and shifted to the right this indicates that while the blockage correction works well for c p it is not able to capture all the complicated flow physics that occurs with a change in t s r interestingly there is very little correction of the bachant et al data for low t s r due to the insensitivity of stall to r e which occurs at low t s r it is also important to note that even at 2 2 blockage the data from the present study are still corrected perceptibly this is illustrated in fig 8 which shows the ratio of uncorrected to corrected values of t s r c t and c p for blockage ratios from 1 to 50 a range covered in kinsey and dumas 2017 jeong et al 2018 and ross and polagye 2020 this analysis was conducted at a representative value at peak c p using the same blockage correction method it shows that the percent increase in c p due to blockage is approximately equal to the blockage ratio itself moreover this illustrates a significant challenge of testing turbines in laboratory conditions namely the trade off between models large enough to achieve r e independence but not so large as to be influenced significantly by blockage 3 1 3 influence of turbine depth turbine performance as a function of blade tip depth was also examined the blade tip depth z t i p is defined as the distance from the free surface to the upper tip of the turbine blades the results are shown in fig 9 for three tip depths from z 0 21 m z t i p d 0 19 to 0 76 m z t i p d 0 70 normalized by the turbine diameter there appears to be little difference between the performance at the deepest and shallowest tip depths as both appear within the same bound of uncertainty observations at the intermediate depth z t i p d 0 35 do appear to show a very slight improvement particularly at higher tip speed ratios turbine blockage may cause acceleration near the free surface increasing the flow speed on the section of the blade near the surface for the z t i p d 0 35 this may be negated for the z t i p d 0 19 case due to other free surface effects overall it seems that there is very little influence of the free surface on turbine performance at these depths particularly near the point of peak power these results indicate that it may not be detrimental to place a turbine near the free surface a positive result for floating turbine systems similar to rm2 bachant and wosnik 2014 characterized the wake behind a cross flow turbine similar to rm2 and found that vertical mean flow is an important transport mechanism in near wake dynamics considering these results turbine proximity to the free surface may prove to be a key parameter when considering wake recovery in turbine arrays 3 2 performance characteristics unsteady flow conditions the influence of surface waves on turbine performance is now investigated results are presented for three deep water wave forms with wave parameters listed in table 2 the ever changing inflow that a turbine blade experiences during one rotation is now further complicated by a horizontal and vertical velocity shear across the span of the blade fig 4 at a wave encounter frequency that is different than the turbine rotation frequency the result is a very complex unsteady flow field 3 2 1 temporal average the effects of unsteady flow conditions due to surface waves on the temporal average power coefficient is compared to steady flow conditions in fig 10 all results presented in the figure have a diameter based reynolds number of r e d 1 6 1 0 6 there appears to be a slight decrease in the power coefficient in the presence of waves compared to the current only case with the peak power coefficient reduced by at most 7 in the case of current and waves the presence of surface waves produced a complicated flow field for the turbine as discussed below and highlighted in fig 10 the rotational rate of the turbine was noticeably inconsistent as each blade passed through a wave crest higher velocity and a wave trough lower velocity the lower velocity conditions combined with segments of the turbine rotation with a high angle of attack to the relative flow potentially increased the incidence of dynamic stall discussed in laneville and vittecoq 1986 as compared to the steady case thus reducing the performance additionally the continual change of turbine rotation rate may have resulted in increased structural vibrations further degrading turbine performance even with these adverse conditions few data points fall outside the bound of measurement uncertainty suggesting that the turbine is largely insensitive to the waves selected for this study at least when quantified by the temporal average bachant and wosnik 2011 experimentally investigated the influence of waves on the performance characteristics of a gorlov type cross flow turbine both power and drag coefficients showed a small increase for the wave cases as compared to the steady flow case additionally the turbine stalled at higher tip speed ratios in waves than in steady flow this again highlights the complicated flow conditions with surface waves the helical shaped gorlov turbine blades may be less susceptible to performance degradation from velocity shear as compared to the straight darrieus h type turbine blades 3 2 2 turbine angular position phase average plotting the power coefficient as a function of the turbine angular position θ t shown in fig 11 provides a more interesting perspective on the impact of waves on turbine performance for reference θ t 0 is when the reference blade chord is parallel to the incoming flow i e the 3 o clock position when viewed from above with incoming flow from the 12 o clock position the second blade is oriented parallel to the flow when θ t 12 0 and the third when θ t 24 0 under current only conditions plotted as gray symbols on figs 11a c and e the relative velocity experienced by a single blade varies significantly with turbine angular position as shown in fig 6a each complete rotation of the turbine features three torque peaks one for each of the three turbine blades during the portion of the rotation when one blade is most productive the other two blades are potentially less productive or can even produce torque in the opposite direction depending on the conditions small asymmetries between peaks are evident likely artifacts of assembly or manufacturing there is also a larger range of measured values at the peaks and troughs of the power coefficient curve quantified as the standard deviation and shown in figs 11b d and f the current only case has been included for comparison to the current and wave case and has been phase shifted in figs 11a c and e only so as not to obscure the current and wave case results the current and wave case is shown in each of figs 11a c e as colored symbols which correspond to the wave phase angle θ w at the turbine shaft at the time of observation dark blue and dark red symbols indicating the wave crest θ w 0 36 0 and green symbols indicating the wave trough θ w 18 0 the wave phase angle was determined by fitting a sine wave to the surface elevation measurements using a nonlinear least squares fit algorithm the fit function has the form η h 2 cos ω e t θ w where η is the free surface elevation and ω e is the encounter frequency of the wave the encounter frequency is defined as ω e ω 0 ω 0 2 u t o w g for a turbine advancing directly into oncoming waves here ω 0 is the wave angular frequency without the influence of a current equal to 2 π t where t is the wave period data for both the current only and the current and wave cases were divided into 1 bins by turbine angle at the time of observation the mean power coefficient value for each of these bins was calculated with approximately 20 data points per bin and are represented by the black symbols the peak bin averaged power coefficient appears to be slightly reduced in the presence of waves compared to the current only case this is in agreement with the results shown in fig 10 close inspection shows that particularly at the peaks of the power coefficient curves the range of power coefficient values is larger in the current and wave case than it is for the current only case it is also notable that the observations above the bin average curve are colored dark blue and dark red associated with wave crest passage and maximum streamwise velocity and observations below the bin average curve are colored light blue green and yellow associated with wave trough passage and minimum streamwise velocity for figs 11a and c to quantify the difference between the current only and the wave and current cases the bin standard deviation was plotted as a function of turbine angular position and is shown in fig 11b d and f again the gray symbols represent the current only case the black symbols represent the current and wave case for each respective wave the bin standard deviations for the current only s c and current and wave s c w cases were normalized by the overall mean of the bin standard deviations for the current only case 9 s c 1 n i 1 n s c i where n is the number of bins and s c i is the standard deviation for an individual bin this is intended to provide a relative comparison between the current only and current and wave cases in the case of wave 1 versus wave 2 both waves having the same period t 1 5 s and wave 2 having a height 50 taller than wave 1 h 0 15 m versus 0 10 m the results shown in figs 11b and d are as one might expect the effect of the wave is that the standard deviation near the peak of the power coefficient curve increases denoting a wider range of measurements with the power related to the cube of the relative velocity shown in eq 2 small flow field variations can have significant impacts it should also be noted that wave 2 which is larger and therefore more energetic has a slightly larger impact in terms of power variation however comparing wave 2 and 3 both having the same height h 0 15 m but with wave 3 having a slightly shorter period t 1 2 s compared with wave 2 t 1 5 s the difference is dramatic fig 11f shows almost no difference between the bin standard deviation of the current only and current and wave cases this difference is investigated further in fig 12 fig 12 is a magnification of the area enclosed by the gray dashed line rectangles shown in figs 11a c and e in fig 12a and b the data are comparatively ordered meaning that when the advancing blade encounters a wave crest the result is a larger than average power output likewise when the advancing blade encounters a wave trough the result is a smaller than average power output thought of another way there appears to be a degree of constructive synchronization between the encounter frequency of the wave and the rotation frequency of the turbine on the other hand the data in fig 12c show significantly less order when the advancing blade encounters a wave crest the result is not necessarily an above average power output indicating that the adverse effects on one or both of the other blades must be larger in the case of wave 3 than with waves 1 or 2 the result is a markedly narrower band of power coefficient observations and thus a smaller bin standard deviation though not shown this was true for all other observations under these wave conditions further study will be required to understand the relationship between the wave encounter frequency and the turbine rotation frequency but this result highlights the potential for control schemes that could minimize wave impact and maximize power forbush et al 2017 4 conclusions a 1 6 scale model of the u s department of energy s reference model 2 riverine hydrokinetic turbine was tested in the large towing tank facility at the u s naval academy turbine performance was evaluated over a range of tip speed ratios and diameter based reynolds numbers these results were compared to previous observations made of the same model turbine the impact of tip depth on turbine performance was also examined under current only conditions finally the impact of surface waves on turbine performance was investigated in current only conditions c p was calculated for a range of t s r values from 2 5 to 4 5 at diameter based reynolds numbers from 1 1 to 1 8 1 0 6 r e c 1 8 3 0 1 0 5 reynolds number independence as indicated by a consistent c p was observed at or above r e d 1 5 1 0 6 with c p 0 36 at t s r 3 2 these performance results agree with previous observations made by bachant et al 2016 within the bounds of measurement uncertainty although the dependence threshold for the present study is slightly higher than was observed in the previous study the difference is thought to be due in part to blockage which was 2 2 for the present study and 9 7 for bachant et al when corrected for blockage using the methodology developed by houlsby et al 2008 the results for the two facilities on the same model at the same approximate reynolds number are shown to be in reasonable agreement moreover it is estimated that even at this relatively large geometric scale a portion of the blade may still be in the slightly reynolds number dependent regime as the turbine is intended to be surface mounted performance in terms of power coefficient over a range of tip speed ratios was assessed at three different depths z t i p d equal to 0 19 0 35 and 0 70 although there was some statistically significant variation between depths at higher tip speed ratios near the point of peak performance there was little notable difference suggesting the turbine to be fairly insensitive to free surface effects at least within the range of depths tested turbine performance was also examined in the presence of three model waves all scaled to provide velocity shear over the entire span of the blade at the installed depth of the three waves two waves had the same wavelengths but different significant wave heights and two waves had the same significant wave heights but different wavelengths this was done in an effort to discern how the individual wave parameters affect performance the presence of waves appeared to degrade the temporal average power coefficient of the turbine slightly outside the bound of uncertainty but in all cases less than 7 this suggests that at least for the conditions of the present experiment the turbine is fairly insensitive to waves this is only a preliminary finding however and further more comprehensive testing will be required to properly illuminate the relationship between turbines and the range of waves they may potentially encounter when plotted as a function of turbine angular position the coefficient of power is shown to be highly periodic with a peak for each turbine blade results were compared between the current only and current and wave cases the slight degradation of the current and wave case as compared to the current only case is clearly shown in the case of current and waves there is more variation in the power produced near the point of peak power production compared to the current only case and this variation was shown to increase with wave height and therefore energy for one set of waves however the results for another wave with a different wave period showed almost no change at all between the two cases indicating that there is likely significant opportunity for active control measures to reduce the impact of waves on turbine power and likely also fatigue loading credit authorship contribution statement ethan e lust validation data curation visualization writing review editing supervision

21278,in this paper added mass and drag coefficients for typical subsea manifolds installation conditions are determined through experimental model tests the forced oscillation test results show that the equipment has large drag coefficients in the low keulegan carpenter kc region which leads to higher damping the results also show that the added mass increases with higher kc number values and is appreciably larger than those found in the literature for flat plates even when extrapolated to a prism with the experimentally obtained hydrodynamic coefficients a series of analytical and numerical

including x trees manifolds templates etc e g albuquerque et al 2013 it is typically accomplished using construction vessels equipped with large cranes capable of lifting the payload overboarding it above the sea surface and lowering it through the wave zone to the seabed as depicted in fig 1 once the equipment is submerged it is subjected to hydrodynamic loads from the ocean environment combined with vessel motions in response to incident waves transmitted through the crane to the installation cable in deepwater fields the increase of cable length to lower the equipment to the seabed imposes additional challenges as most offshore cranes are equipped with steel wire rope the additional weight can limit the effective payload also as the length of the cable increases the system axial stiffness decreases which leads to higher natural periods and possibly higher dynamic loads due to resonance these factors may result in restrictive metocean conditions for safe operations leading to increased waiting time for adequate sea states and rendering higher costs for subsea installation equipment operations to calculate the system dynamic response the hydrodynamic loads acting on the equipment must be estimated this estimation is based on morison s formulation which has two empirical coefficients the added mass coefficient c a which represents hydrodynamic inertia forces and the drag coefficient c d which represents hydrodynamic resistance forces most of the time those coefficients are estimated based on literature values typically given for simple geometries and steady flow conditions however during equipment lowering the vessel response to incident waves impose a vertical oscillatory motion on the top of the crane cable which is transmitted to the equipment as such the subsea equipment also moves in an oscillatory manner and c a c d estimates based on steady flow may be off the mark e g sarpkaya 2010 hydrodynamic inertia or added mass affects the natural period of the system large inertia values lead to higher natural periods that can come close to typical wave periods and peak vessel response in this case this resonance can result in severe dynamic loads on the other hand drag forces dampen the system response mitigating resonance and lessening peak dynamic loads as such a more precise estimation of c a and c d coefficients may lead to reduced dynamic responses and consequently less restricted operations and lower costs obtaining those coefficients has been extensively studied in the literature øritsland et al 1989 conducted forced oscillation tests for simple structures such as plates and frames in various kc flow regimes molin and nielsen 2004 combined potential flow formulation and a quadratic discharge equation to estimate added mass and drag forces on porous plates subjected to oscillatory flows yang et al 2020 used methods based on potential theory to estimate hydrodynamic forces on cylinder shaped columns for low reynolds and kc numbers for complex geometries fernandes and mineiro 2007 used potential theory to estimate the added mass of a subsea manifold with good agreement with experimental results stahl et al 2011 used cfd methods to estimate hydrodynamic forces on bops during their installation for low kc numbers lopez at al 2017 revisited those cfd methods for bop hydrodynamic forces estimation due to the complex geometry of most subsea equipment and scarce data on correspondent c a and c d values in highly oscillatory flows forced oscillation model tests are proposed as a solution for obtaining more precise estimates for those coefficients these tests require that the geometric characteristics of the modeled equipment are accurately reproduced in that regard 3d printing technology can be used to build cheaper faster and more detailed models to quantify the potential gain of the proposed approach a comparison is carried out between the dynamic response considering typical c a and c d estimates steady flow and those obtained from the forced oscillation tests presented in this work two approaches were used for the analysis an analytical formulation based on dnv gl as 2017 section 5 3 7 and a numerical model constructed in orcaflex 2 lifting operation analysis 2 1 morison hydrodynamic forces morison et al 1950 proposed a formulation to estimate hydrodynamic forces acting on cylinders subjected to fluid flow according to dnv gl as 2017 section 2 4 1 2 it may also be utilized to estimate hydrodynamic forces acting on submerged equipment with dimensions smaller than 2π 5kw where kw is the hydrodynamic wave number which can be approximated by ω2 g for deepwater waves assuming the surrounding fluid medium seawater is still and the object is in motion the force is given by eq 1 below 1 f h t ρ c a v r r 1 2 ρ c d a p r r where f h is the resulting hydrodynamic force ρ is the mass density of the surrounding fluid seawater c a is the added mass coefficient v r is a reference volume of the object assumed as the volume of a circumscribed cylinder for flat plates or as the volume of a parallelepiped enveloping the equipment for model test results table a 2 of dnv rp n103 2017 shows v r values for various simple geometries r is the object motion c d is the drag coefficient and a p is the object projected area normal to ṙ the coefficients c a and c d are determined empirically the term ρc a v r of eq 1 is called the added mass this portion of the hydrodynamic force represents the fluid mass surrounding the body in motion that moves with it the surrounding fluid is accelerated when the body accelerates and there is a positive variation in its kinetic energy due to the dynamic coupling between both sarpkaya 2010 this mass is also noted as a 33 because for a rigid body 6 6 inertia matrix it would be added to the i 3 and j 3 component keulegan and carpenter 1958 have shown that when using morison formulation on objects subjected to oscillatory motion respective to the surrounding fluid c a and c d vary in function of an adimensional parameter called the keulegan carpenter number kc given by eq 2 2 kc u 0 t l o b j where u 0 is the velocity amplitude of motion t is the motion period and l obj is a characteristic dimension of the object thus steady flow or motion conditions can be approached by very large values of t and kc c a can also be expressed in terms of the inertia coefficient c m by the following equation 3 c a c m 1 when the surrounding fluid is moving the body velocity and acceleration in eq 1 are replaced by the relative velocity and acceleration with the addition of froude krylov force corresponding to the term 1 in the right hand side of eq 3 for the fluid acceleration e g newman 1977 2 2 analytical approach to equipment suspended by cable ideally let us consider a piece of submerged subsea equipment hoisted by a near vertical straight rope connected to the vessel crane the rope dynamics can be represented by axial vibrations of a flexible continuous bar with concentrated mass damping and applied loads at its bottom end representing forces on the subsea equipment subjected to imposed oscillatory motion at its top representing vessel motion fig 2 shows an illustration of the idealized system static forces such as weight and buoyancy are neglected because the formulation goal is to obtain the system dynamic response they can be linearly added to the dynamic solution afterward if cable total force is needed and are considered in the dynamic amplification factor criterion shown in eqs 32 and 33 for assessing cable slack occurrence the axial motion of the cable in this system can be described by eq 4 4 m 2 w t 2 1 2 ρ c d f π d w t w t ea 2 w z 2 0 where m is the mass per unit length of the cable ρ is the mass density of the surrounding fluid seawater c df is the drag coefficient related to axial drag forces in the cable d is the cable diameter ea is its axial stiffness and w is the cable axial displacement along its length eq 4 is a nonlinear partial differential equation that represents a flexible continuous bar subjected to axial excitation second order relative to both independent variables t and z so it requires two initial conditions and two boundary conditions to be solved as shown below 5 w z 0 η a 6 w z 0 i ω η a 7 w 0 t η a e i ω t 8 m a 33 2 w t 2 1 2 ρ c d z a p w t w t ea w z 0 a t w l t where η a is the motion amplitude at the top of the cable ω is the frequency in rad s of the same motion m is the equipment mass a 33 is its added mass given by the first term of eq 1 in the vertical direction c dz is the drag coefficient for the equipment in the same direction and a p is the equipment projected area the initial conditions represent the application of harmonic motion η a e iωt at the top of the bar which is initially at static equilibrium the boundary condition depicted in eq 7 is the imposed motion at the top of the cable while eq 8 represents the summation of vertical forces acting on the equipment at the bottom end of the cable z l excluding static forces equipment weight buoyancy and static cable elastic force both eqs 4 and 9 have a nonlinear drag force term proportional to w t w t to reach an analytical solution both equations are linearized by linear equivalent damping coefficients obtained by considering the same energy dissipation in one harmonic cycle e g faltinsen 1998 the linearized equations are shown below 9 m 2 w t 2 σ w t ea 2 w z 2 0 10 m a 33 2 w t 2 σ w t ea w z 0 where 11 σ 4 3 π ρ c d f π d ω η a 12 σ 4

solutions the wave number k is a function of the cable drag damping coefficient σ and the parameter h depends on the lifted object mass including added mass and drag damping coefficient as the linearization of the equipment damping coefficient depends on the response η l and usually σ the equipment c dz and a 33 parameters are expected to have a large influence on the system response from eqs 17 and 20 transfer functions can be defined to allow for spectral response assessment in function of an incident wave spectrum for irregular sea conditions these transfer functions are obtained by dividing the appropriate response by the motion amplitude at the top of the cable as shown in eqs 21 and 22 below 21 h l ω η l η a 22 h f ω f d l η a where h l is the equipment motion transfer function and h f is the equipment force transfer function for the real scenario of a crane vessel moving in response to irregular incident waves the response spectra can be calculated by 23 s l ω h l ω h a ω 2 s ω 24 s f ω h f ω h a ω 2 s ω where h a is the vessel motion rao for vertical displacement at crane tip in function form 2 3 numerical modeling another approach to simulate the dynamic response of the system including vessel cable and equipment is to discretize the system in smaller components and use numerical methods to solve the resulting equation system the main advantage of such an approach is the direct consideration of non linearities especially in the drag force terms in this paper the software used for numerical simulation is orcaflex from orcina ltd 3 determination of c dz and a 33 by tests forced oscillation tests may be performed to obtain c dz and a 33 coefficients for subsea equipment the test comprises building a scaled model and assembling it in an actuator mounted on a test tank with the equipment submerged and sufficiently far from the free surface and tank boundaries the actuator applies a forced oscillatory motion to the model registering time series of its motion and the resultant loads measured by a load cell denoting z t as the measured motion time series and f t as the measured load time series both series are correlated after appropriate filtering by eq 25 25 f t a z b z z where a and b are coefficients adjusted by the least squares method the added mass coefficient c a can then be calculated as 26 c a a m ρ v r the drag coefficient c d can also be calculated by 27 c d 2 b ρ a p both c a and c d values are expected to vary with different kc numbers so multiple tests are performed corresponding to different kc this non dimensional parameter is represented by the following equation 28 kc z m a x t l e q where ż max is the maximum velocity of the imposed motion the added mass a 33 can then be calculated by 29 a 33 ρ v r c a the drag coefficient c dz is assumed equal to the obtained coefficient c d from the test the index z is utilized to indicate that this coefficient applies to motion in the vertical direction 3 1 modeled equipment the modeled equipment for this study resembles the subsea manifolds designed for deepwater fields in southeastern brazil table 1 shows the main dimensions and weight of the models and their full scale counterparts 3 2 test setup three scaled models of manifolds were built in 1 35 scale and tested the design of the models focused on preserving the main aspects of the geometry the inertial characteristics and the hydrostatic properties of their full scale counterparts as the equipment structures are composed of sharp edges and metallic profiles hydrodynamic flow around it is likely to have well defined separation points as such boundary layer effects dependent on reynolds number which is not preserved between the full scale design and the models are expected to be less important the models were built with a mix of metallic components and 3d printed parts to achieve maximum geometric similarity and have sufficient robustness to be handled during testing fig 3 shows the tested as built models to execute the forced oscillation tests a special apparatus was designed and installed on the test basin it consists of a structure connecting the model to the loadcell to measure the loads during the tests and a carriage to apply the required motion as shown in fig 4 additionally an optical tracking system was used to measure the carriage motions the model was reassembled in a different orientation each time to obtain results in other directions although for the present study only vertical direction coefficients are considered as lateral loads acting in the submerged equipment during deepwater lowering are typically considered static and can be treated separately the attached bar influence on the near flow field was checked with simplified cfd computational fluid dynamics modeling as presented in fig 5 the simulations were performed for a steady state flow regime so only drag related results are checked not added mass however it is reasonably assumed that such a slender object moving parallel to the flow direction has a negligible influence on inertia effects when compared to the bluff body shaped model the drag force obtained without the bar is 3 90 n corresponding to a drag coefficient cd of 0 703 with the attached bar the obtained force and cd were 3 88 n and 0 699 respectively less than 1 difference between both configurations 3 3 test matrix to evaluate the coefficients for a realistic operational condition several kc number values were reproduced the test oscillation frequency was chosen by froude scaling in time so that an oscillation frequency of 0 1 hz 10 s period in full scale is represented which is a very common occurrence in the field as such all forced oscillation tests were carried out with the same motion frequency 0 59 hz this corresponds to a sarpkaya beta frequency parameter as given by eq 30 of approximately 5 104 30 β l e q 2 ν t as the kc number is a function of the motion displacement amplitude and the equipment reference dimension each model was tested with different motion amplitudes to match the desired kc values as shown in table 2 each test case was repeated three times to check the repeatability of the results 3 4 spectral analysis and filtering all acquired data was post processed to remove noise eventually caused both by the actuator or by inherent sources in the acquisition system for this purpose a low pass 8th order butterworth filter was applied spectral analysis was used to verify the optimal cut frequency to apply to the filter the morison force decomposition spectral density for one of the test cases fig 6 shows that the inertial component is concentrated on the motion frequency 0 59 hz but the drag component presents a small peak on another frequency 1 77 hz due to the nonlinear component ṙ ṙ of morison s equation thus a cut frequency of 2 0 hz was used in the butterworth filter the range of small kc numbers in table 2 warrants that inertia force is to be much greater than drag force as shown in fig 6 figs 7 and 8 show examples of time series and spectral analysis of the measured force before and after the post processing this method allows the estimation of the hydrodynamic coefficients with more accuracy small fluctuations can be noted near the crests and troughs of the force signal as shown in fig 7 the programmed forced oscillation motion leads to very small velocity values near the trough and crest of the displacement signal the forced oscillating apparatus has a motor connected to a rack pinion gear assembly so that at very small velocities it requires very small rotations of the motor and consequently a very small step for the pinion rack gear at this operating condition some vibration due to the discrete steps determined by the rack pinion geometry is expected and the most probable source of the observed fluctuations 3 5 hydrodynamic coefficients calculation method an optimization process was chosen as it allows the estimation of morison s equation coefficients using the inputs of the measured total forces and the measured velocities and accelerations this method is particularly useful in matching a non linear function in this case the merit parameter used to find the coefficients was the quadratic difference between the estimated force and the measured force fig 9 shows an example of the applied method 4 results and discussion 4 1 test results after post processing all data and estimating the hydrodynamic coefficients it is possible to plot an overview of the estimated coefficients c m and c dz on all tested conditions for all models using c m kc and c dz kc scatter plots as can be seen in figs 10 and 11 a very low deviation between repetitions is observed showing the strong consistency of the applied method the results show an increase in the inertia force expressed by the c m coefficient with increasing kc values manifold a shows consistently larger c m values across the tested kc range followed by manifold c and then manifold b drag forces show a sharp increase in low kc values 1 5 for higher kc c dz tends to a constant limit value manifold b resulted in larger drag for kc 1 while manifold c showed larger drag for lower kc values manifold a has a lower c dz overall all manifolds resulted in significantly larger drag forces than those predicted by flat plate drag coefficients for steady flow as presented in dnv gl as 2017 appendix b 4 2 analytical assessment of test results during a typical installation the main hoist cable is paid out slowly so that its deployed length increases while the equipment is lowered towards the seabed the dynamic response of the system depends on the length of cable l deployed as shown in eq 4 through 20 thus the variation of such response must be assessed throughout the entire water depth the analytical formulation developed provides a way to quickly assess system response at various equipment positions across the water depth so that those prone to resonance occurrence may be identified as the cable length increases its total stiffness decreases and the frequency of peak response also decreases when the natural frequency of the system coincides with the peak response of the crane vessel vertical motion rao at the hoist location and the corresponding sea state peak period frequency large dynamic response amplification of equipment motion and force is expected at resonance the magnitude of this dynamic amplification is usually limited by the system damping which is mainly caused by the hydrodynamic drag force in the equipment to illustrate this consider the parameters shown in table 3 corresponding to manifold b being installed in 2400 m of water depth by a crane vessel which is estimated to have 1 m of single amplitude maximum heave response at the crane tip the equipment motion response amplitude can be calculated by eq 17 given the parameters from table 3 and a suitable set of equipment hydrodynamic coefficients c a and c dz kc shown in eq 28 can also be calculated by eq 31 provided that the motion is harmonic 31 kc 2 π η l l e q where l eq is the smaller horizontal dimension of the object eq 31 means that larger kc values correspond to larger oscillation amplitudes of the subsea unit as shown by øritsland et al 1989 equipment c a and c dz obtained in tests are a function of kc table 4 shows the coefficient values considered in the following analysis taken from the test results shown previously the øritsland s 1989 test was done for simpler flat plates instead of the actual complex geometry of subsea equipment shown in fig 3 the additional top structure above the porous flat plate in fig 3 including the trapped water effect warrants that the added mass and drag coefficients of figs 10 and 11 are greater than those of simpler flat plates used in dnv and øritsland tests as for the drag coefficients of a flat plate for oscillatory motions in low kc number he 2003 and jang et al 2019 also reported values in the range of 5 10 which is similar to øritsland et al 1989 considering the installation depth of 2400 m 12 equipment positions along the water column are analyzed to identify the critical depth for dynamic response typical installation vessels have peak heave response to incident waves with peak period t p between 10 and 12 s thus cable lengths that have a peak response period in this range are considered critical for resonance occurrence fig 12 summarizes the equipment motion and dynamic force amplitude response obtained with the analytical formulation for each cable length considered in 3d plot form it consists of three axes period s cable length m and response either η l m or f dl kn the main curves show the equipment motion and dynamic force amplitude as a function of period and cable length the curves on the bottom plane composed by the period s and cable length m axes correspond to the response peaks on the main curves denoting the period for the maximum response for each cable length the curves on the left plane composed by the cable length and response axes also correspond to the response peaks showing the maximum equipment motion or dynamic force amplitude as a function of cable length see fig 12 the increase in the equipment drag coefficient c dz leads to smaller response peak values near resonance periods all tests resulted in higher drag coefficients than both references dnv gl as 2017 and øritsland et al 1989 dnv gl as 2017 appendix b drag coefficients valid for steady flow conditions lead to a significant underestimation of damping in the cable equipment system which leads to a highly over conservative response both a 33 and c dz values influence the period at which the response peaks occur the increase in added mass or damping leads to higher resonance periods as c dz decreases with increasing kc values while a 33 increases with increasing kc values mixed influences for the peak response periods are expected only the steady state condition coefficients dnv gl as 2017 appendix a and b yielded lower peak response periods due to its lower a 33 and c dz values peak response values for equipment motion amplitude remain somewhat constant with cable length increase on the other hand peak response values for dynamic force amplitude show significant variation with cable length for shorter cable lengths peak dynamic force response is higher because the higher frequency response leads to higher equipment acceleration values and consequently higher inertia force at longer cable lengths 1600 m and higher a second natural frequency appears in the response leading to even higher dynamic force amplitude values this higher frequency component is narrow banded limited to periods below 2 s so it is not expected to contribute significantly to the response once actual incident waves and vessel motion are considered peak response periods for equipment motion amplitude become higher as the equipment is lowered as more mass is added to the system and the cable axial stiffness decreases for longer cable lengths 1600 m a small secondary peak can be observed in the response corresponding to the second natural frequency for dynamic force amplitude response this secondary peak yields higher force values than the primary response peak which is reflected in the cable length vs period plot of the graph for all sets of coefficients from test results maximum kc values were less than 1 00 so test results for kc values between 0 50 and 1 00 are more representative of the analyzed scenario considering a peak vessel response period of 10 12 s for vertical motion at the crane tip a cable length around 1000 1200 m results in peak equipment motion for all analyzed hydrodynamic coefficients sets except for those from dnv gl as 2017 which corresponds to a steady flow scenario and show peak response around 1200 1600 m due to its lower c a and c dz values peak dynamic force ignoring second natural frequency peaks in the same response period range occurs for cable lengths around 1200 1600 m peak force decreases with lower kc numbers which corresponds to higher c dz and lower a 33 values dnv gl as 2017 flat plate coefficients again resulted in a largely overestimated peak dynamic force especially when the second natural frequency peak is disregarded øritsland et al 1989 flat plate test results marintek resulted in reduced dynamic force in comparison to dnv gl as 2017 but actual manifold tests showed an even lower response probably due to higher c dz results lower kc numbers also tend to shift the peak to the left of the graph towards lower periods probably due to smaller a 33 values 4 3 numerical simulation of a real scenario the analytical assessment shown previously although useful for making rough estimates of the dynamic response of the system has limitations in its premises especially related to the linearization of the drag forces on the cable and equipment numerical models of the vessel cable equipment system allow the proper consideration of nonlinearities such as the drag force material properties for fiber ropes nonlinear waves lifting sling arrangements snap loading etc to assess the benefits of using model tests to estimate hydrodynamic coefficients for equipment installation a numerical model was built in commercial program orcaflex orcina lta 2018 this model uses line elements to represent all cables and a 6dof buoy element to represent the equipment the model is simulated in the time domain with time steps of 0 1 s a crane vessel with proper rao functions was considered to calculate the motion applied to the top of the cable fig 13 shows a screenshot of the built model a comparison with the analytical response shown in fig 12 is carried out to validate the model the equipment is initially positioned at 800 1200 and 1600 m of water depth and harmonic motion with 1 m of single amplitude and period between 3 and 18 s in 0 5 s increments is applied at the hoist line top the time domain simulation is then run for 60 s after a ramp time of 60 s to smooth out any transient response to obtain the steady state system response equipment single amplitude vertical displacement and cable dynamic force are obtained directly from the response time series fig 14 shows a comparison between the analytical and numerical responses markers denote the numerical responses obtained while continuous lines are the analytical solutions as shown in fig 12 the results show good agreement between the analytical solution and the numerical model the motion periods analyzed in the numerical model do not include the high frequency response corresponding around 1 s period but usually response in this frequency range can be ignored as typical sea states and vessel motion responses have little significant energy in such short periods to assess the impact of assuming the hydrodynamic coefficients obtained in the tests on real operational analysis irregular seas analysis is carried out for all coefficient sets and water depths ranging from 200 to 2400 m jonswap wave spectrum hasselman 1973 is assumed for the irregular sea states with significant wave heights h s ranging from 1 0 to 2 5 m and peak periods t p from 4 to 15 s each simulation is run for 1800 s according to dnv gl as 2017 reccomendations all responses were assumed to be rayleigh distributed papoulis and pillai 2002 and the most probable maximum mpm values were considered assuming a 3 h sea state realization and a 1 risk factor also recommended by dnv gl as 2017 except risk factor which is chosen deliberately as an example case mpm value estimation by the rayleigh distribution depends only on the response standard deviation and number of events considered an 1800 s response time series contains approximately 180 heave cycles enough to obtain a sufficient estimation of the response standard deviation according to the dnv gl as 2017 the following criterion must be fulfilled to avoid snap loads in slings and or the hoist line 32 f h y d 0 9 f s t a t m i n where f hyd is the mpm hydrodynamic force acting on the equipment and fstat min is the static force in the bottom end of the hoist line equal to the submerged weight of the equipment as such a dynamic amplification factor daf can be defined to normalize this criterion as shown in eq 33 below 33 daf f s t a t m i n f h y d f s t a t m i n to fulfill the criterion daf should be equal to or less than 1 9 fig 15 shows the obtained daf along the water depth for each set of c a and c dz coefficients analyzed averaged between all values of h s and t p analyzed it can be observed that the average daf has its maximum value at 600 m or lower and around 1200 of water depth in dnv and test kc 0 50 cases while øritsland et al 1989 marintek and test kc 1 50 cases show maximum values around 800 of water depth this is because these cases have higher equipment added mass values which lead to higher resonance periods while those other cases have lower added mass and consequently lower resonance periods as the hoist line axial stiffness decreases with depth lower natural periods correspond to resonance at shallower depths while higher natural periods show resonance at deeper positions overall the dnv coefficients set shows higher average dafs throughout the water depth mainly due to its lower c dz value which also explains the high daf values for even shallower depths less than 600 m as higher frequency responses are not completely damped as in the higher c dz cases considering the results shown in fig 15 two water depths are chosen for more in depth analysis 800 and 1200 m fig 16 shows contour plots representing obtained kc numbers for each simulation in function of h s and t p kc number is usually defined for regular single frequency motions as shown in eq 31 for irregular seas analysis kc will be assumed based on the mpm equipment displacement amplitude obtained for two reasons the first is conservatism because higher kc usually yields higher dynamic response due to the lower drag coefficient c dz so assuming mpm displacement will conservatively yield higher corresponding kc the second reason is that usually peak dynamic force occurrences in a response time series are associated with peaks in equipment displacement so that the desired mpm dynamic force value occurs at the same time as the mpm equipment displacement or at least a close value the background color plots represent the mpm most probable maximum daf values dnv gl as 2017 hydrodynamic parameters resulted in lower dynamic forces than øritsland et al 1989 and the high kc test results for 800 m of water depth this is mainly because of the significant difference in added mass as evidenced before as shown in fig 12 the peak response for dnv gl as 2017 parameters for 10 12 s of period occurs with longer cable lengths which explains the milder response at 800 m it also shows that the peak dynamic force for this parameter set is near a period of 8 s as the vessel peak vertical movement is near 12 s the reduced mpm dynamic force is explained however for 1200 m of water depth the inverse is true dnv gl as 2017 hydrodynamic parameters yield the worst results mainly due to reduced damping because of the low c dz øritsland et al 1989 hydrodynamic parameters results are very close to the obtained test results for kc equal to 1 5 which is the same value assumed in that report the model test however resulted in a near 35 larger drag coefficient which explains the milder response in all water depths however fig 16 shows that for most sea states kc is equal to or lower than 1 25 especially with h s up to 2 0 m a common occurrence for these kc values drag coefficients are higher and the added masses are smaller resulting in lower dynamic forces to make a comparison between dnv gl as 2017 øritsland et al 1989 and the model test results operational windows are constructed from the simulation results the daf for each sea state in the model test cases was extracted from the simulation that yields the kc number nearest to that set in the respective model test thus the actual result considered is a combination of the results from all analyzed models with the appropriate hydrodynamic parameters set considering this criterion the safe operating conditions for all analyzed hydrodynamic coefficients sets are shown in fig 17 green regions are the sea states which resulted in safe operational conditions while red regions correspond to those that yielded unsafe results the benefits of considering the model test based coefficient set are quite evident especially when compared with dnv gl as 2017 estimates operational windows in this case include more sea states leading to less standby weather downtime reducing operational cost øritsland et al 1989 results are similar to tests with kc equal to 1 50 but as shown in fig 16 in most conditions kc is lower than 1 50 which leads to lower added mass and higher drag reducing dynamic forces and resulting in better operational windows 5 conclusions the goal of this paper is to propose the use of model test based added mass and drag coefficients c a and c d for estimating the dynamics of subsea equipment manifolds installation system these hydrodynamic parameters for the real complex geometry are significantly higher than the traditionally used values for simpler flat plates in the typical operational range of kc numbers therefore they have a significant impact on the simulated dynamic response of such equipment during conventional installation which in turn contributes to improve safety and reduce costs the forced oscillation model tests were conducted with three different types of manifolds for a practical range of kc numbers the scaled models constructed from shop parts and 3d printing reproduced adequately the geometric details of the original equipment the produced hydrodynamic coefficients were systematically analyzed and compared with those from simpler approaches using flat plate results a typical subsea unit lowering system was numerically modeled by using a commercial program and the simulations were repeated for various sea states analytical and numerical analyses showed that the obtained test results indeed led to increased operational windows fulfilling the stated goals credit authorship contribution statement rafael guimarães pestana conceptualization

21278,in this paper added mass and drag coefficients for typical subsea manifolds installation conditions are determined through experimental model tests the forced oscillation test results show that the equipment has large drag coefficients in the low keulegan carpenter kc region which leads to higher damping the results also show that the added mass increases with higher kc number values and is appreciably larger than those found in the literature for flat plates even when extrapolated to a prism with the experimentally obtained hydrodynamic coefficients a series of analytical and numerical simulations are conducted for a typical installation operation for various sea states the results show that the operational windows for subsea equipment installation are expanded when compared to the

including x trees manifolds templates etc e g albuquerque et al 2013 it is typically accomplished using construction vessels equipped with large cranes capable of lifting the payload overboarding it above the sea surface and lowering it through the wave zone to the seabed as depicted in fig 1 once the equipment is submerged it is subjected to hydrodynamic loads from the ocean environment combined with vessel motions in response to incident waves transmitted through the crane to the installation cable in deepwater fields the increase of cable length to lower the equipment to the seabed imposes additional challenges as most offshore cranes are equipped with steel wire rope the additional weight can limit the effective payload also as the length of the cable increases the system axial stiffness decreases which leads to higher natural periods and possibly higher dynamic loads due to resonance these factors may result in restrictive metocean conditions for safe operations leading to increased waiting time for adequate sea states and rendering higher costs for subsea installation equipment operations to calculate the system dynamic response the hydrodynamic loads acting on the equipment must be estimated this estimation is based on morison s formulation which has two empirical coefficients the added mass coefficient c a which represents hydrodynamic inertia forces and the drag coefficient c d which represents hydrodynamic resistance forces most of the time those coefficients are estimated based on literature values typically given for simple geometries and steady flow conditions however during equipment lowering the vessel response to incident waves impose a vertical oscillatory motion on the top of the crane cable which is transmitted to the equipment as such the subsea equipment also moves in an oscillatory manner and c a c d estimates based on steady flow may be off the mark e g sarpkaya 2010 hydrodynamic inertia or added mass affects the natural period of the system large inertia values lead to higher natural periods that can come close to typical wave periods and peak vessel response in this case this resonance can result in severe dynamic loads on the other hand drag forces dampen the system response mitigating resonance and lessening peak dynamic loads as such a more precise estimation of c a and c d coefficients may lead to reduced dynamic responses and consequently less restricted operations and lower costs obtaining those coefficients has been extensively studied in the literature øritsland et al 1989 conducted forced oscillation tests for simple structures such as plates and frames in various kc flow regimes molin and nielsen 2004 combined potential flow formulation and a quadratic discharge equation to estimate added mass and drag forces on porous plates subjected to oscillatory flows yang et al 2020 used methods based on potential theory to estimate hydrodynamic forces on cylinder shaped columns for low reynolds and kc numbers for complex geometries fernandes and mineiro 2007 used potential theory to estimate the added mass of a subsea manifold with good agreement with experimental results stahl et al 2011 used cfd methods to estimate hydrodynamic forces on bops during their installation for low kc numbers lopez at al 2017 revisited those cfd methods for bop hydrodynamic forces estimation due to the complex geometry of most subsea equipment and scarce data on correspondent c a and c d values in highly oscillatory flows forced oscillation model tests are proposed as a solution for obtaining more precise estimates for those coefficients these tests require that the geometric characteristics of the modeled equipment are accurately reproduced in that regard 3d printing technology can be used to build cheaper faster and more detailed models to quantify the potential gain of the proposed approach a comparison is carried out between the dynamic response considering typical c a and c d estimates steady flow and those obtained from the forced oscillation tests presented in this work two approaches were used for the analysis an analytical formulation based on dnv gl as 2017 section 5 3 7 and a numerical model constructed in orcaflex 2 lifting operation analysis 2 1 morison hydrodynamic forces morison et al 1950 proposed a formulation to estimate hydrodynamic forces acting on cylinders subjected to fluid flow according to dnv gl as 2017 section 2 4 1 2 it may also be utilized to estimate hydrodynamic forces acting on submerged equipment with dimensions smaller than 2π 5kw where kw is the hydrodynamic wave number which can be approximated by ω2 g for deepwater waves assuming the surrounding fluid medium seawater is still and the object is in motion the force is given by eq 1 below 1 f h t ρ c a v r r 1 2 ρ c d a p r r where f h is the resulting hydrodynamic force ρ is the mass density of the surrounding fluid seawater c a is the added mass coefficient v r is a reference volume of the object assumed as the volume of a circumscribed cylinder for flat plates or as the volume of a parallelepiped enveloping the equipment for model test results table a 2 of dnv rp n103 2017 shows v r values for various simple geometries r is the object motion c d is the drag coefficient and a p is the object projected area normal to ṙ the coefficients c a and c d are determined empirically the term ρc a v r of eq 1 is called the added mass this portion of the hydrodynamic force represents the fluid mass surrounding the body in motion that moves with it the surrounding fluid is accelerated when the body accelerates and there is a positive variation in its kinetic energy due to the dynamic coupling between both sarpkaya 2010 this mass is also noted as a 33 because for a rigid body 6 6 inertia matrix it would be added to the i 3 and j 3 component keulegan and carpenter 1958 have shown that when using morison formulation on objects subjected to oscillatory motion respective to the surrounding fluid c a and c d vary in function of an adimensional parameter called the keulegan carpenter number kc given by eq 2 2 kc u 0 t l o b j where u 0 is the velocity amplitude of motion t is the motion period and l obj is a characteristic dimension of the object thus steady flow or motion conditions can be approached by very large values of t and kc c a can also be expressed in terms of the inertia coefficient c m by the following equation 3 c a c m 1 when the surrounding fluid is moving the body velocity and acceleration in eq 1 are replaced by the relative velocity and acceleration with the addition of froude krylov force corresponding to the term 1 in the right hand side of eq 3 for the fluid acceleration e g newman 1977 2 2 analytical approach to equipment suspended by cable ideally let us consider a piece of submerged subsea equipment hoisted by a near vertical straight rope connected to the vessel crane the rope dynamics can be represented by axial vibrations of a flexible continuous bar with concentrated mass damping and applied loads at its bottom end representing forces on the subsea equipment subjected to imposed oscillatory motion at its top representing vessel motion fig 2 shows an illustration of the idealized system static forces such as weight and buoyancy are neglected because the formulation goal is to obtain the system dynamic response they can be linearly added to the dynamic solution afterward if cable total force is needed and are considered in the dynamic amplification factor criterion shown in eqs 32 and 33 for assessing cable slack occurrence the axial motion of the cable in this system can be described by eq 4 4 m 2 w t 2 1 2 ρ c d f π d w t w t ea 2 w z 2 0 where m is the mass per unit length of the cable ρ is the mass density of the surrounding fluid seawater c df is the drag coefficient related to axial drag forces in the cable d is the cable diameter ea is its axial stiffness and w is the cable axial displacement along its length eq 4 is a nonlinear partial differential equation that represents a flexible continuous bar subjected to axial excitation second order relative to both independent variables t and z so it requires two initial conditions and two boundary conditions to be solved as shown below 5 w z 0 η a 6 w z 0 i ω η a 7 w 0 t η a e i ω t 8 m a 33 2 w t 2 1 2 ρ c d z a p w t w t ea w z 0 a t w l t where η a is the motion amplitude at the top of the cable ω is the frequency in rad s of the same motion m is the equipment mass a 33 is its added mass given by the first term of eq 1 in the vertical direction c dz is the drag coefficient for the equipment in the same direction and a p is the equipment projected area the initial conditions represent the application of harmonic motion η a e iωt at the top of the bar which is initially at static equilibrium the boundary condition depicted in eq 7 is the imposed motion at the top of the cable while eq 8 represents the summation of vertical forces acting on the equipment at the bottom end of the cable z l excluding static forces equipment weight buoyancy and static cable elastic force both eqs 4 and 9 have a nonlinear drag force term proportional to w t w t to reach an analytical solution both equations are linearized by linear equivalent damping coefficients obtained by considering the same energy

solutions the wave number k is a function of the cable drag damping coefficient σ and the parameter h depends on the lifted object mass including added mass and drag damping coefficient as the linearization of the equipment damping coefficient depends on the response η l and usually σ the equipment c dz and a 33 parameters are expected to have a large influence on the system response from eqs 17 and 20 transfer functions can be defined to allow for spectral response assessment in function of an incident wave spectrum for irregular sea conditions these transfer functions are obtained by dividing the appropriate response by the motion amplitude at the top of the cable as shown in eqs 21 and 22 below 21 h l ω η l η a 22 h f ω f d l η a where h l is the equipment motion transfer function and h f is the equipment force transfer function for the real scenario of a crane vessel moving in response to irregular incident waves the response spectra can be calculated by 23 s l ω h l ω h a ω 2 s ω 24 s f ω h f ω h a ω 2 s ω where h a is the vessel motion rao for vertical displacement at crane tip in function form 2 3 numerical modeling another approach to simulate the dynamic response of the system including vessel cable and equipment is to discretize the system in smaller components and use numerical methods to solve the resulting equation system the main advantage of such an approach is the direct consideration of non linearities especially in the drag force terms in this paper the software used for numerical simulation is orcaflex from orcina ltd 3 determination of c dz and a 33 by tests forced oscillation tests may be performed to obtain c dz and a 33 coefficients for subsea equipment the test comprises building a scaled model and assembling it in an actuator mounted on a test tank with the equipment submerged and sufficiently far from the free surface and tank boundaries the actuator applies a forced oscillatory motion to the model registering time series of its motion and the resultant loads measured by a load cell denoting z t as the measured motion time series and f t as the measured load time series both series are correlated after appropriate filtering by eq 25 25 f t a z b z z where a and b are coefficients adjusted by the least squares method the added mass coefficient c a can then be calculated as 26 c a a m ρ v r the drag coefficient c d can also be calculated by 27 c d 2 b ρ a p both c a and c d values are expected to vary with different kc numbers so multiple tests are performed corresponding to different kc this non dimensional parameter is represented by the following equation 28 kc z m a x t l e q where ż max is the maximum velocity of the imposed motion the added mass a 33 can then be calculated by 29 a 33 ρ v r c a the drag coefficient c dz is assumed equal to the obtained coefficient c d from the test the index z is utilized to indicate that this coefficient applies to motion in the vertical direction 3 1 modeled equipment the modeled equipment for this study resembles the subsea manifolds designed for deepwater fields in southeastern brazil table 1 shows the main dimensions and weight of the models and their full scale counterparts 3 2 test setup three scaled models of manifolds were built in 1 35 scale and tested the design of the models focused on preserving the main aspects of the geometry the inertial characteristics and the hydrostatic properties of their full scale counterparts as the equipment structures are composed of sharp edges and metallic profiles hydrodynamic flow around it is likely to have well defined separation points as such boundary layer effects dependent on reynolds number which is not preserved between the full scale design and the models are expected to be less important the models were built with a mix of metallic components and 3d printed parts to achieve maximum geometric similarity and have sufficient robustness to be handled during testing fig 3 shows the tested as built models to execute the forced oscillation tests a special apparatus was designed and installed on the test basin it consists of a structure connecting the model to the loadcell to measure the loads during the tests and a carriage to apply the required motion as shown in fig 4 additionally an optical tracking system was used to measure the carriage motions the model was reassembled in a different orientation each time to obtain results in other directions although for the present study only vertical direction coefficients are considered as lateral loads acting in the submerged equipment during deepwater lowering are typically considered static and can be treated separately the attached bar influence on the near flow field was checked with simplified cfd computational fluid dynamics modeling as presented in fig 5 the simulations were performed for a steady state flow regime so only drag related results are checked not added mass however it is reasonably assumed that such a slender object moving parallel to the flow direction has a negligible influence on inertia effects when compared to the bluff body shaped model the drag force obtained without the bar is 3 90 n corresponding to a drag coefficient cd of 0 703 with the attached bar the obtained force and cd were 3 88 n and 0 699 respectively less than 1 difference between both configurations 3 3 test matrix to evaluate the coefficients for a realistic operational condition several kc number values were reproduced the test oscillation frequency was chosen by froude scaling in time so that an oscillation frequency of 0 1 hz 10 s period in full scale is represented which is a very common occurrence in the field as such all forced oscillation tests were carried out with the same motion frequency 0 59 hz this corresponds to a sarpkaya beta frequency parameter as given by eq 30 of approximately 5 104 30 β l e q 2 ν t as the kc number is a function of the motion displacement amplitude and the equipment reference dimension each model was tested with different motion amplitudes to match the desired kc values as shown in table 2 each test case was repeated three times to check the repeatability of the results 3 4 spectral analysis and filtering all acquired data was post processed to remove noise eventually caused both by the actuator or by inherent sources in the acquisition system for this purpose a low pass 8th order butterworth filter was applied spectral analysis was used to verify the optimal cut frequency to apply to the filter the morison force decomposition spectral density for one of the test cases fig 6 shows that the inertial component is concentrated on the motion frequency 0 59 hz but the drag component presents a small peak on another frequency 1 77 hz due to the nonlinear component ṙ ṙ of morison s equation thus a cut frequency of 2 0 hz was used in the butterworth filter the range of small kc numbers in table 2 warrants that inertia force is to be much greater than drag force as shown in fig 6 figs 7 and 8 show examples of time series and spectral analysis of the measured force before and after the post processing this method allows the estimation of the hydrodynamic coefficients with more accuracy small fluctuations can be noted near the crests and troughs of the force signal as shown in fig 7 the programmed forced oscillation motion leads to very small velocity values near the trough and crest of the displacement signal the forced oscillating apparatus has a motor connected to a rack pinion gear assembly so that at very small velocities it requires very small rotations of the motor and consequently a very small step for the pinion rack gear at this operating condition some vibration due to the discrete steps determined by the rack pinion geometry is expected and the most probable source of the observed fluctuations 3 5 hydrodynamic coefficients calculation method an optimization process was chosen as it allows the estimation of morison s equation coefficients using the inputs of the measured total forces and the measured velocities and accelerations this method is particularly useful in matching a non linear function in this case the merit parameter used to find the coefficients was the quadratic difference between the estimated force and the measured force fig 9 shows an example of the applied method 4 results and discussion 4 1 test results after post processing all data and estimating the hydrodynamic coefficients it is possible to plot an overview of the estimated coefficients c m and c dz on all tested conditions for all models using c m kc and c dz kc scatter plots as can be seen in figs 10 and 11 a very low deviation between repetitions is observed showing the strong consistency of the applied method the results show an increase in the inertia force expressed by the c m coefficient with increasing kc values manifold a shows consistently larger c m values across the tested kc range followed by manifold c and then manifold b drag forces show a sharp increase in low kc values 1 5 for higher kc c dz tends to a constant limit value manifold b resulted in larger drag for kc 1 while manifold c showed larger drag for lower kc values manifold a has a lower c dz overall all manifolds resulted in significantly larger drag forces than those predicted by flat plate drag coefficients for steady flow as presented in dnv gl as 2017 appendix b 4 2 analytical assessment of test results during a typical installation the main hoist cable is paid out slowly so that its deployed length increases while the equipment is lowered towards the seabed the dynamic response of the system depends on the length of cable l deployed as shown in eq 4 through 20 thus the variation of such response must be assessed throughout the entire water depth the analytical formulation developed provides a way to quickly assess system response at various equipment positions across the water depth so that those prone to resonance occurrence may be identified as the cable length increases its total stiffness decreases and the frequency of peak response also decreases when the natural frequency of the system coincides with the peak response of the crane vessel vertical motion rao at the hoist location and the corresponding sea state peak period frequency large dynamic response amplification of equipment motion and force is expected at resonance the magnitude of this dynamic amplification is usually limited by the system damping which is mainly caused by the hydrodynamic drag force in the equipment to illustrate this consider the parameters shown in table 3 corresponding to manifold b being installed in 2400 m of water depth by a crane vessel which is estimated to have 1 m of single amplitude maximum heave response at the crane tip the equipment motion response amplitude can be calculated by eq 17 given the parameters from table 3 and a suitable set of equipment hydrodynamic coefficients c a and c dz kc shown in eq 28 can also be calculated by eq 31 provided that the motion is harmonic 31 kc 2 π η l l e q where l eq is the smaller horizontal dimension of the object eq 31 means that larger kc values correspond to larger oscillation amplitudes of the subsea unit as shown by øritsland et al 1989 equipment c a and c dz obtained in tests are a function of kc table 4 shows the coefficient values considered in the following analysis taken from the test results shown previously the øritsland s 1989 test was done for simpler flat plates instead of the actual complex geometry of subsea equipment shown in fig 3 the additional top structure above the porous flat plate in fig 3 including the trapped water effect warrants that the added mass and drag coefficients of figs 10 and 11 are greater than those of simpler flat plates used in dnv and øritsland tests as for the drag coefficients of a flat plate for oscillatory motions in low kc number he 2003 and jang et al 2019 also reported values in the range of 5 10 which is similar to øritsland et al 1989 considering the installation depth of 2400 m 12 equipment positions along the water column are analyzed to identify the critical depth for dynamic response typical installation vessels have peak heave response to incident waves with peak period t p between 10 and 12 s thus cable lengths that have a peak response period in this range are considered critical for resonance occurrence fig 12 summarizes the equipment motion and dynamic force amplitude response obtained with the analytical formulation for each cable length considered in 3d plot form it consists of three axes period s cable length m and response either η l m or f dl kn the main curves show the equipment motion and dynamic force amplitude as a function of period and cable length the curves on the bottom plane composed by the period s and cable length m axes correspond to the response peaks on the main curves denoting the period for the maximum response for each cable length the curves on the left plane composed by the cable length and response axes also correspond to the response peaks showing the maximum equipment motion or dynamic force amplitude as a function of cable length see fig 12 the increase in the equipment drag coefficient c dz leads to smaller response peak values near resonance periods all tests resulted in higher drag coefficients than both references dnv gl as 2017 and øritsland et al 1989 dnv gl as 2017 appendix b drag coefficients valid for steady flow conditions lead to a significant underestimation of damping in the cable equipment system which leads to a highly over conservative response both a 33 and c dz values influence the period at which the response peaks occur the increase in added mass or damping leads to higher resonance periods as c dz decreases with increasing kc values while a 33 increases with increasing kc values mixed influences for the peak response periods are expected only the steady state condition coefficients dnv gl as 2017 appendix a and b yielded lower peak response periods due to its lower a 33 and c dz values peak response values for equipment motion amplitude remain somewhat constant with cable length increase on the other hand peak response values for dynamic force amplitude show significant variation with cable length for shorter cable lengths peak dynamic force response is higher because the higher frequency response leads to higher equipment acceleration values and consequently higher inertia force at longer cable lengths 1600 m and higher a second natural frequency appears in the response leading to even higher dynamic force amplitude values this higher frequency component is narrow banded limited to periods below 2 s so it is not expected to contribute significantly to the response once actual incident waves and vessel motion are considered peak response periods for equipment motion amplitude become higher as the equipment is lowered as more mass is added to the system and the cable axial stiffness decreases for longer cable lengths 1600 m a small secondary peak can be observed in the response corresponding to the second natural frequency for dynamic force amplitude response this secondary peak yields higher force values than the primary response peak which is reflected in the cable length vs period plot of the graph for all sets of coefficients from test results maximum kc values were less than 1 00 so test results for kc values between 0 50 and 1 00 are more representative of the analyzed scenario considering a peak vessel response period of 10 12 s for vertical motion at the crane tip a cable length around 1000 1200 m results in peak equipment motion for all analyzed hydrodynamic coefficients sets except for those from dnv gl as 2017 which corresponds to a steady flow scenario and show peak response around 1200 1600 m due to its lower c a and c dz values peak dynamic force ignoring second natural frequency peaks in the same response period range occurs for cable lengths around 1200 1600 m peak force decreases with lower kc numbers which corresponds to higher c dz and lower a 33 values dnv gl as 2017 flat plate coefficients again resulted in a largely overestimated peak dynamic force especially when the second natural frequency peak is disregarded øritsland et al 1989 flat plate test results marintek resulted in reduced dynamic force in comparison to dnv gl as 2017 but actual manifold tests showed an even lower response probably due to higher c dz results lower kc numbers also tend to shift the peak to the left of the graph towards lower periods probably due to smaller a 33 values 4 3 numerical simulation of a real scenario the analytical assessment shown previously although useful for making rough estimates of the dynamic response of the system has limitations in its premises especially related to the linearization of the drag forces on the cable and equipment numerical models of the vessel cable equipment system allow the proper consideration of nonlinearities such as the drag force material properties for fiber ropes nonlinear waves lifting sling arrangements snap loading etc to assess the benefits of using model tests to estimate hydrodynamic coefficients for equipment installation a numerical model was built in commercial program orcaflex orcina lta 2018 this model uses line elements to represent all cables and a 6dof buoy element to represent the equipment the model is simulated in the time domain with time steps of 0 1 s a crane vessel with proper rao functions was considered to calculate the motion applied to the top of the cable fig 13 shows a screenshot of the built model a comparison with the analytical response shown in fig 12 is carried out to validate the model the equipment is initially positioned at 800 1200 and 1600 m of water depth and harmonic motion with 1 m of single amplitude and period between 3 and 18 s in 0 5 s increments is applied at the hoist line top the time domain simulation is then run for 60 s after a ramp time of 60 s to smooth out any transient response to obtain the steady state system response equipment single amplitude vertical displacement and cable dynamic force are obtained directly from the response time series fig 14 shows a comparison between the analytical and numerical responses markers denote the numerical responses obtained while continuous lines are the analytical solutions as shown in fig 12 the results show good agreement between the analytical solution and the numerical model the motion periods analyzed in the numerical model do not include the high frequency response corresponding around 1 s period but usually response in this frequency range can be ignored as typical sea states and vessel motion responses have little significant energy in such short periods to assess the impact of assuming the hydrodynamic coefficients obtained in the tests on real operational analysis irregular seas analysis is carried out for all coefficient sets and water depths ranging from 200 to 2400 m jonswap wave spectrum hasselman 1973 is assumed for the irregular sea states with significant wave heights h s ranging from 1 0 to 2 5 m and peak periods t p from 4 to 15 s each simulation is run for 1800 s according to dnv gl as 2017 reccomendations all responses were assumed to be rayleigh distributed papoulis and pillai 2002 and the most probable maximum mpm values were considered assuming a 3 h sea state realization and a 1 risk factor also recommended by dnv gl as 2017 except risk factor which is chosen deliberately as an example case mpm value estimation by the rayleigh distribution depends only on the response standard deviation and number of events considered an 1800 s response time series contains approximately 180 heave cycles enough to obtain a sufficient estimation of the response standard deviation according to the dnv gl as 2017 the following criterion must be fulfilled to avoid snap loads in slings and or the hoist line 32 f h y d 0 9 f s t a t m i n where f hyd is the mpm hydrodynamic force acting on the equipment and fstat min is the static force in the bottom end of the hoist line equal to the submerged weight of the equipment as such a dynamic amplification factor daf can be defined to normalize this criterion as shown in eq 33 below 33 daf f s t a t m i n f h y d f s t a t m i n to fulfill the criterion daf should be equal to or less than 1 9 fig 15 shows the obtained daf along the water depth for each set of c a and c dz coefficients analyzed averaged between all values of h s and t p analyzed it can be observed that the average daf has its maximum value at 600 m or lower and around 1200 of water depth in dnv and test kc 0 50 cases while øritsland et al 1989 marintek and test kc 1 50 cases show maximum values around 800 of water depth this is because these cases have higher equipment added mass values which lead to higher resonance periods while those other cases have lower added mass and consequently lower resonance periods as the hoist line axial stiffness decreases with depth lower natural periods correspond to resonance at shallower depths while higher natural periods show resonance at deeper positions overall the dnv coefficients set shows higher average dafs throughout the water depth mainly due to its lower c dz value which also explains the high daf values for even shallower depths less than 600 m as higher frequency responses are not completely damped as in the higher c dz cases considering the results shown in fig 15 two water depths are chosen for more in depth analysis 800 and 1200 m fig 16 shows contour plots representing obtained kc numbers for each simulation in function of h s and t p kc number is usually defined for regular single frequency motions as shown in eq 31 for irregular seas analysis kc will be assumed based on the mpm equipment displacement amplitude obtained for two reasons the first is conservatism because higher kc usually yields higher dynamic response due to the lower drag coefficient c dz so assuming mpm displacement will conservatively yield higher corresponding kc the second reason is that usually peak dynamic force occurrences in a response time series are associated with peaks in equipment displacement so that the desired mpm dynamic force value occurs at the same time as the mpm equipment displacement or at least a close value the background color plots represent the mpm most probable maximum daf values dnv gl as 2017 hydrodynamic parameters resulted in lower dynamic forces than øritsland et al 1989 and the high kc test results for 800 m of water depth this is mainly because of the significant difference in added mass as evidenced before as shown in fig 12 the peak response for dnv gl as 2017 parameters for 10 12 s of period occurs with longer cable lengths which explains the milder response at 800 m it also shows that the peak dynamic force for this parameter set is near a period of 8 s as the vessel peak vertical movement is near 12 s the reduced mpm dynamic force is explained however for 1200 m of water depth the inverse is true dnv gl as 2017 hydrodynamic parameters yield the worst results mainly due to reduced damping because of the low c dz øritsland et al 1989 hydrodynamic parameters results are very close to the obtained test results for kc equal to 1 5 which is the same value assumed in that report the model test however resulted in a near 35 larger drag coefficient which explains the milder response in all water depths however fig 16 shows that for most sea states kc is equal to or lower than 1 25 especially with h s up to 2 0 m a common occurrence for these kc values drag coefficients are higher and the added masses are smaller resulting in lower dynamic forces to make a comparison between dnv gl as 2017 øritsland et al 1989 and the model test results operational windows are constructed from the simulation results the daf for each sea state in the model test cases was extracted from the simulation that yields the kc number nearest to that set in the respective model test thus the actual result considered is a combination of the results from all analyzed models with the appropriate hydrodynamic parameters set considering this criterion the safe operating conditions for all analyzed hydrodynamic coefficients sets are shown in fig 17 green regions are the sea states which resulted in safe operational conditions while red regions correspond to those that yielded unsafe results the benefits of considering the model test based coefficient set are quite evident especially when compared with dnv gl as 2017 estimates operational windows in this case include more sea states leading to less standby weather downtime reducing operational cost øritsland et al 1989 results are similar to tests with kc equal to 1 50 but as shown in fig 16 in most conditions kc is lower than 1 50 which leads to lower added mass and higher drag reducing dynamic forces and resulting in better operational windows 5 conclusions the goal of this paper is to propose the use of model test based added mass and drag coefficients c a and c d for estimating the dynamics of subsea equipment manifolds installation system these hydrodynamic parameters for the real complex geometry are significantly higher than the traditionally used values for simpler flat plates in the typical operational range of kc numbers therefore they have a significant impact on the simulated dynamic response of such equipment during conventional installation which in turn contributes to improve safety and reduce costs the forced oscillation model tests were conducted with three different types of manifolds for a practical range of kc numbers the scaled models constructed from shop parts and 3d printing reproduced adequately the geometric details of the original equipment the produced hydrodynamic coefficients were systematically analyzed and compared with those from simpler approaches using flat plate results a typical subsea unit lowering system was numerically modeled by using a commercial program and the simulations were repeated for various sea states analytical and numerical analyses showed that the obtained test results indeed led to increased operational windows fulfilling the stated goals credit authorship contribution statement rafael guimarães pestana conceptualization

21279,to provide data for the numerical modelling effort on the impact of seabed nodule harvesting on the marine environment and infrastructure an experimental study of the interaction between a simple lab scale nodule harvester and sediment sand is carried out the lab scale harvester is simplified by a moving inclined plate and the seabed sediment is modelled by a tank containing water and bentonite suspension or sand as sediment substitute the forces acting on the plate by the sediment are measured and the dispersion of sediment particles in the water tank is visualized experiment results show that for a high enough mass fraction the bentonite suspension displays a yield stress behavior and indeed a gel like structure suspension may result sand being non cohesive in nature gives a much greater acting force on the plate than bentonite sediment gel like structure clay suspension gives a much greater force than fluidified suspension once dispersed into water sand particles quickly settle while clay particles take a longer time to settle and form an emulsion layer on top of the sediment the experiment results serve both as a means to calibrate and validate the numerical modelling as well as to gain physical insights into the seabed structure interaction keywords seabed nodule harvesting bentonite suspension sediment dispersion 1 introduction deepsea seabed nodule harvesting has been a subject of interest both in research and development and as a business model for a promising emerging industry that could be potentially worth many billions of dollars these nodules lying on or burying in a shallow layer of the seabed in certain regions of the ocean contain a rich proportion of manganese petterson and tawake 2019 mukhopadhyay et al 2019 however environmental concern and cost have been the key issues delaying harvesting at an industrial scale nodule harvesting from the seabed involves the interaction between the nodule harvester and seabed sediment this process creates sedimentary plumes which may spread a considerable distance from the harvesting site and take a considerable time to re settle oebius and shriever 2001 tran duc et al 2017 2018 2019 the interactions between a structure and the sediment bed under shallow water have been studied both experimentally baker 1979 and numerically gazi and afzal 2019 2020 afzal et al 2020 gazi et al 2019 in these studies the effects of current and waves on the hydrodynamic forces are considerable however in a deep sea scenario where current and waves effects are truly negligible in comparison with the hydrodynamic forces induced by the mass movement of the seabed sediment we can focus on the sediment dispersion together with the interactions between the physical harvesting equipment and the environment in order to fully understand these aspects in this paper an experimental study of the interactions between a modelled lab scale nodule harvester and sediment is presented in the experiment a lab scale simplified version of the harvester an inclined plate is moving through a bed of sediment in a water tank as a representative of the seabed environment the experiment results serve both as a mean to calibrate and validate the numerical model via force measurements and sediment dispersion visualization bertevas et al 2019 as well as gaining physical insights into the seabed structure interaction in 2015 a field survey of the clarion clipperton fracture zone ccfz region by ocean minerals singapore oms a joint venture between keppel and lockheed martin uk a few seabed core samples were brought back their rheological properties have been measured and found to be similar to bentonite clay suspension of a similar concentration henceforth bentonite suspensions are used as a model for seabed sediment in this experimental study the rheological properties of bentonite suspensions have been well studied choo and bai 2015 luckham and rossi 1999 lin et al 2016 while the flow the drag and the relaxation of bentonite suspensions have been characterized in some details abu jdayil 2011 benslimane et al 2016 chafe and de bruyn 2005 it has been found that bentonite suspensions exhibit thixotropy shear thinning and yield stress the viscosity and shear stress increased with increasing bentonite concentration and storage time choo and bai 2015 rising temperature increases the inter particle attractive forces clay particles are platelets in nature which in turn leads to enhanced particle particle interactions affecting the yield stress and the suspension viscosity luckham and rossi 1999 lin et al 2016 when a sphere moving slowly through a 6 wt bentonite suspension the drag force increases weakly with the speed of the sphere for a freshly re mixed sample and it may not be able to move at the same force for a suspension which has sufficient time to gel chafe and de bruyn 2005 in addition there are some experimental results with carbopol gel for a flow of a yield stress fluid around an inclined plate ouattara et al 2018 2019 all those mentioned references provide the basis for the understanding of our experimental results 2 experiment set up an acrylic tank with dimension 200 cm length x 50 cm width x 80 cm height is used to contain a clay mixture of bentonite suspension and water fig 1 as a model of seabed environment the sodium bentonite used in this experiment is available from innoco oil pte ltd it has a density of 2600 kg m3 and 9 10 ph two mass fractions of bentonite in bentonite suspension are studied 1 68 and 3 36 or approximately 0 65 and 1 30 in volume fractions the suspensions are well mixed a plate of 50 cm length x 15 cm width is placed at 23 75 cm height from the tank bottom to the plate centre point and at 45 degree inclined orientation the plate is moved by a motor at a set speed from one end of the tank to the other on parallel rigid poles through lubricated bearings the speed of the plate quickly accelerates from zero to the set speed and is maintained at that constant speed until it is quickly reduced to zero at the end of the run the plate is then rested for 10 s before moving in the reverse direction to the start of the run the forces acting on the plate by the clay mixture are measured using two load cells giving two force components f x the horizontal force and f y the vertical force fig 2 the stiffness of the rods is high so that bending and flexing can be assumed negligible here in the next step water is added into the tank to create a lab scale simplified model of the seabed environment this will be referred to as sediment in a water tank or water column hereafter water is filled up to 40 cm height from the tank bottom and the mass fractions of bentonite to the total mass of water and bentonite are 1 and 2 respectively for the two cases with corresponding volume fractions of 0 38 and 0 77 the experiment is carried out again to measure the forces acting on the plate and to visualize the sediment dispersion captured by a camera for later examination in addition the interaction between a moving plate and a sand bed is also carried out to provide a comparison case in this the bentonite sediment is replaced by fine river sand imported from australia with a maximum sand particle diameter of 0 6 mm sand specific gravity of 2 5 and bulk density of approximately 1500 kg m3 an amount of 310 kg of sand is deposited in a 200 cm length x 50 cm width x 80 cm height acrylic tank water is filled up to 40 cm height from the tank bottom to avoid jamming and piling up at the two ends at the end of a run the sand level at the two ends is reduced in the middle of the tank sand is spread evenly at a height of about 23 75 cm from the bottom and this length is about 100 cm fig 3 when the inclined plate angle changes from 45 degree to 30 degree and to 60 degree the height of the sand level from the bottom of the tank changes from 23 75 cm to 25 30 cm and to 22 55 cm respectively hence the thickness of the sand layer that the plate penetrates is about the same 5 3 cm for these three test cases the forces acting on the plate by the sand bed are measured with force sensors the dispersion of sand is also captured by a camera for flow visualization in the experiment the residual forces acting on the plate are initialized to zero on the data acquisition system so that the force measurements only represent the dynamic forces acting on the plate after the reverse run the plate is allowed to rest for 52 s and the next cycle is again started fifteen such cycles are repeated to complete one experimental run the resting time between the two runs is about two days resting time greatly slows down the flow in the tank in order to reduce the effect of the flow turbulence on the next experimental run the resting time is also designed to show the time dependent flow behavior of the clay suspension its thixotropy 3 experiment results and discussion the experiment results may be affected by many factors such as the accuracy of load cells force measurement arrangement errors and the resting time between two experiment runs the load cell accuracy is 0 25 of the rated output to minimize the measurement errors due to the experiment set up the forces are carefully calibrated before any run and after any change in the experimental set up the consistency repeatability of the measurements is also checked two experimental runs with 3 36 mass fraction bentonite suspension on the tank are performed right after the bentonite suspension was well mixed the time between the two runs is two days fig 4 shows that the force measurements in these two runs are consistent figs 5 and 6 show the case of a 1 68 bentonite in suspension and 1 bentonite in the water column and b 3 36 bentonite in suspension and 2 bentonite in the water column visually the bentonite suspension at 1 68 mass fraction is milky while the bentonite suspension at 3 36 mass fraction is muddy and gel like in appearance this observation is consistent with previously reported studies showing that the concentration of bentonite affects the rheological properties and a high enough bentonite concentration causes the formation of a continuous gel like structure instead of individual flocs abu jdayil 2011 luckham and rossi 1999 when water is added into the tank sediment in the water column to simulate the seabed environment for case a the bentonite suspension cannot maintain its clear shape structure because the clay particles dispersed into water after about two days in the tank there are three layers of materials the top layer is water with dispersed clay particles the middle layer is an emulsion like mixture of water and clay particles the bottom layer is a clay suspension and for case b the bentonite suspension maintains its shape structure in the tank there are two distinct layers the top layer is clear water and the bottom layer is the bentonite suspension for case a the measured forces are quite close to those for the case when the tank only contains water f x m a x f y m a x 2 n with 45 degree plate inclination f x and f y in this case are quite symmetric about the time axis and their absolute maximum values are about the same meanwhile for case b the forces are higher than those when the tank only contains water f x m a x 3 5 n f y m a x 2n f x and f y for this case are asymmetric about the time axis and the absolute maximum values for f x are higher than those for f y the force measurements in case a are consistent for fifteen repeated cycles meanwhile for case b they are changing over the fifteen repeated cycles for case b 3 36 bentonite in suspension 2 bentonite in the seabed water column the bentonite sediment forms a gel like structure and shows a time dependent thixotropic flow behavior the forces f x and f y are a result of the stresses resulting from the material deformation and the dynamic forces of the material flow the increase of f x in case b is likely due to the yield stress and the largest effective viscosity of the sediment bed and f x and f y are no longer symmetric about the time axis probably due to the change of the flow and stress fields induced by a change of the sediment bed rheology in short bentonite concentration needs to be high enough for the bentonite suspension to show the properties and behavior of yield stress fluid and to form a gel like structure suspension 3 36 bentonite mass fraction is sufficient for the resulting sediment to show gel like properties this finding is particularly relevant for computation simulations in choosing the proper bentonite mass fraction and selecting a more reasonable constitutive model for the sediment for case b the plate movement disrupts the gel like structure of the suspension fluidizes it and reduces its viscosity chafe and de bruyn 2005 the forces are highest in their first cycle when the suspension is in its gel like structure form and exhibits a yield stress and then reduced steeply in the second cycle when the gel like structure gets largely destroyed the forces reduce more gradually in subsequent cycles and then asymptotically to a stable value when the gel like structure is fully destroyed and extra resistance is induced by a vanishing yield stress when the plate moves in the clay sediment water column its movement destroys the gel like structure of the sediment and disperses the clay particles into the water fig 7 the force measurements are highest in the first cycle then reduced steeply in the second cycle and gradually in subsequent cycles from the 5th cycles however as the amount of clay particles dispersed into the water increases the forces start to slightly increase fig 6 the runs are repeated three times with a resting time of two days fig 9 shows the force readings for three different runs after the 1st cycle the gel like structure is destroyed leading to a reducing and stabilizing of the force values in the next cycles after 15 repeated cycles this gel like structure may be considered as totally destroyed and the bentonite suspension fully fluidized when the bentonite suspension is left resting for more than two days its gel like structure is recovered and the suspension properties return to their original values chafe and de bruyn 2005 when the plate moves in the clay sediment water column because the dispersed clay particles there are two layers in the tank after the first run the top layer is milky in appearance represents water with dispersed clay particles the bottom layer is the remaining bentonite suspension whose gel like structure has not been destroyed by the moving plate after more than two days in the tank there are three layers the top layer is water with some dispersed clay particles the middle layer is emulsion like a mixture of water and clay particles and the bottom layer is the clay suspension as before because the gel like structure of the material in the tank has not been recovered fig 8 the force measurements in the second and third run are close to each other but different to those in the first run the force values do not change much between the second the third and subsequent cycles fig 9 this observation indicates that once the gel like structure of clay sediment is destroyed it would not be reformed and once the clay particles are dispersed into the water these particles would be in the water for a long time therefore if the harvester disturbed the clay sediment on the seabed the dispersed clay particles would remain in the water and spread further in the surrounding environment a comparison of the measured forces for two different plate moving speeds v 1 0 1 m s and v 2 0 13 m s is shown in fig 10 when the bentonite suspension or the clay sediment is just well mixed the force values are higher with higher plate speed we expect the horizontal force for a plate moving in a newtonian fluid to scale with the square of the speed giving the force ratio at two different speeds to be about v 2 v 1 2 0 13 0 10 2 1 69 in this experiment the measured maximum horizontal force ratios for a plate moving in water 1 56 well mixed bentonite suspension 1 60 and mixed clay sediment 1 60 are in broad agreement with the newtonian fluid theory case 1 2 and 5 in table 1 when the bentonite suspension or the clay sediment is rested for two days the force values for the first cycle are quite close to each other for two different plate moving speeds the measured maximum horizontal forces ratios for the first cycle are 0 93 for rested bentonite suspension and 1 20 for rested clay sediment case 3 and 4 in table 1 for the first cycle of these runs the bentonite suspension or clay sediment is in gel like structure state these measured forces are the forces required to overcome the yield stress at zero velocity jossic and magnin 2001 and can vary significantly depending on how long the material has been previously left at rest coussot 2014 in short the measured force ratios are different between well mixed and rested bentonite suspension or clay sediment the state of the sediment fluidity or gel like structure affects this ratio in chafe and de bruyn 2005 the authors measured the drag force on a sphere moving slowly through a 6 well mixed bentonite suspension for 15 cycles they found that the drag force increases with each cycle due to the material s properties change possibly due to thixotropy we do not observe this in this experiment with 3 36 well mixed bentonite suspension the horizontal force changes very little over 15 cycles after being well mixed the gel like structure slowly recovers over time through the electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged face and the positively charged edge of the bentonite platelets and through face to face and edge to edge interactions through long range electrostatic double layer repulsion choo and bai 2015 the bentonite concentration affects the length of time required for the gel like structure to obtain maximum strength abu jdayil 2011 with 6 bentonite concentration the gel like structure reforms fast enough to have the drag force increase with each cycle while the gel like structure takes longer time to reform with 3 36 bentonite suspension so that the measured horizontal force hardly changes over fifteen cycles fig 4 in the experiment with a sand bed each experimental run consists of only one cycle and each case is repeated three times the measured force values are averaged with time for each cycle and over three experimental runs fig 11 shows the force acting on the 45 degree inclined plate moving in the sand bed the force acting on the plate is many times larger than that for the clay sediment when the plate speed is 0 10 m s and 0 13 m s the averaged total force acting on the plate moving in the sand bed is 283 n and 434 n respectively fig 11 while the average total force acting on the plate moving in the clay sediment is only 3 12 n and 3 86 n respectively fig 10 the dry sand s bulk density is 1500 kg m3 much larger than bentonite suspension density which is slightly larger than water the wetted sand also has a much higher viscosity than the 2 bentonite clay sediment in the water tank the higher density and viscosity of sand leads to higher force on the moving plate than in the case of clay suspensions there are three angles are considered here fig 12 by increasing the plate speed the force is also increased fig 13 shows the averaged total force value under different plate speeds and angles the force for a 45 degree inclined plate is higher than that for a 30 degree inclined plate and the force for a 60 degree inclined plate is higher than that for a 45 degree inclined plate the results demonstrate that the interaction force between the moving plate and the seabed not only depends on the plate moving speeds and the plate inclined angles but also on the seabed material sand or clay sediment their material properties and their states gel like structure or fluidity which depends on the resting time a seabed composed of fine sand may lead to a greater force than a seabed of clay sediment clay sediment in gel like suspension is expected to give a greater force than a fluidized suspension therefore in designing seabed nodule harvester the kind of seabed material and its properties will play a significant role visual observation when the plate moves in a clay sediment and in a sand bed also shows different behaviors sand particles settle down quickly after two days while clay particles settle down at a slower speed and form emulsion layer on top of the sediment bed after two days there are still dispersed clay particles in the water fig 8 these dispersed sediment particles are expected to be carried away by a convected flow process much further downstream than the dispersed sand particles 4 conclusions an experimental study on the interaction between a moving plate and a clay sediment bed and a sand bed in a water tank has been carried out experiment results show that for a high enough mass fraction the bentonite suspension used as a modelled sediment displays a yield stress behavior and indeed a gel like structure suspension sand being non cohesive in nature gives a much greater acting force on the plate than bentonite sediment gel like structure clay suspension gives a much greater force than fluidized suspension once dispersed into water sand particles quickly settle while clay particles take a longer time to settle and form an emulsion layer on top of the sediment the interaction force between the moving plate and seabed depends not only on the plate speeds the plate inclined angles but also on the seabed material and its properties and its state gel like or fluidized our experiment data have been used to validate a smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph two phase mixture model bertevas et al 2019 and

set up an acrylic tank with dimension 200 cm length x 50 cm width x 80 cm height is used to contain a clay mixture of bentonite suspension and water fig 1 as a model of seabed environment the sodium bentonite used in this experiment is available from innoco oil pte ltd it has a density of 2600 kg m3 and 9 10 ph two mass fractions of bentonite in bentonite suspension are studied 1 68 and 3 36 or approximately 0 65 and 1 30 in volume fractions the suspensions are well mixed a plate of 50 cm length x 15 cm width is placed at 23 75 cm height from the tank bottom to the plate centre point and at 45 degree inclined orientation the plate is moved by a motor at a set speed from one end of the tank to the other on parallel rigid poles through lubricated bearings the speed of the plate quickly accelerates from zero to the set speed and is maintained at that constant speed until it is quickly reduced to zero at the end of the run the plate is then rested for 10 s before moving in the reverse direction to the start of the run the forces acting on the plate by the clay mixture are measured using two load cells giving two force components f x the horizontal force and f y the vertical force fig 2 the stiffness of the rods is high so that bending and flexing can be assumed negligible here in the next step water is added into the tank to create a lab scale simplified model of the seabed environment this will be referred to as sediment in a water tank or water column hereafter water is filled up to 40 cm height from the tank bottom and the mass fractions of bentonite to the total mass of water and bentonite are 1 and 2 respectively for the two cases with corresponding volume fractions of 0 38 and 0 77 the experiment is carried out again to measure the forces acting on the plate and to visualize the sediment dispersion captured by a camera for later examination in addition the interaction between a moving plate and a sand bed is also carried out to provide a comparison case in this the bentonite sediment is replaced by fine river sand imported from australia with a maximum sand particle diameter of 0 6 mm sand specific gravity of 2 5 and bulk density of approximately 1500 kg m3 an amount of 310 kg of sand is deposited in a 200 cm length x 50 cm width x 80 cm height acrylic tank water is filled up to 40 cm height from the tank bottom to avoid jamming and piling up at the two ends at the end of a run the sand level at the two ends is reduced in the middle of the tank sand is spread evenly at a height of about 23 75 cm from the bottom and this length is about 100 cm fig 3 when the inclined plate angle changes from 45 degree to 30 degree and to 60 degree the height of the sand level from the bottom of the tank changes from 23 75 cm to 25 30 cm and to 22 55 cm respectively hence the thickness of the sand layer that the plate penetrates is about the same 5 3 cm for these three test cases the forces acting on the plate by the sand bed are measured with force sensors the dispersion of sand is also captured by a camera for flow visualization in the experiment the residual forces acting on the plate are initialized to zero on the data acquisition system so that the force measurements only represent the dynamic forces acting on the plate after the reverse run the plate is allowed to rest for 52 s and the next cycle is again started fifteen such cycles are repeated to complete one experimental run the resting time between the two runs is about two days resting time greatly slows down the flow in the tank in order to reduce the effect of the flow turbulence on the next experimental run the resting time is also designed to show the time dependent flow behavior of the clay suspension its thixotropy 3 experiment results and discussion the experiment results may be affected by many factors such as the accuracy of load cells force measurement arrangement errors and the resting time between two experiment runs the load cell accuracy is 0 25 of the rated output to minimize the measurement errors due to the experiment set up the forces are carefully calibrated before any run and after any change in the experimental set up the consistency repeatability of the measurements is also checked two experimental runs with 3 36 mass fraction bentonite suspension on the tank are performed right after the bentonite suspension was well mixed the time between the two runs is two days fig 4 shows that the force measurements in these two runs are consistent figs 5 and 6 show the case of a 1 68 bentonite in suspension and 1 bentonite in the water column and b 3 36 bentonite in suspension and 2 bentonite in the water column visually the bentonite suspension at 1 68 mass fraction is milky while the bentonite suspension at 3 36 mass fraction is muddy and gel like in appearance this observation is consistent with previously reported studies showing that the concentration of bentonite affects the rheological properties and a high enough bentonite concentration causes the formation of a continuous gel like structure instead of individual flocs abu jdayil 2011 luckham and rossi 1999 when water is added into the tank sediment in the water column to simulate the seabed environment for case a the bentonite suspension cannot maintain its clear shape structure because the clay particles dispersed into water after about two days in the tank there are three layers of materials the top layer is water with dispersed clay particles the middle layer is an emulsion like mixture of water and clay particles the bottom layer is a clay suspension and for case b the bentonite suspension maintains its shape structure in the tank there are two distinct layers the top layer is clear water and the bottom layer is the bentonite suspension for case a the measured forces are quite close to those for the case when the tank only contains water f x m a x f y m a x 2 n with 45 degree plate inclination f x and f y in this case are quite symmetric about the time axis and their absolute maximum values are about the same meanwhile for case b the forces are higher than those when the tank only contains water f x m a x 3 5 n f y m a x 2n f x and f y for this case are asymmetric about the time axis and the absolute maximum values for f x are higher than those for f y the force measurements in case a are consistent for fifteen repeated cycles meanwhile for case b they are changing over the fifteen repeated cycles for case b 3 36 bentonite in suspension 2 bentonite in the seabed water column the bentonite sediment forms a gel like structure and shows a time dependent thixotropic flow behavior the forces f x and f y are a result of the stresses resulting from the material deformation and the dynamic forces of the material flow the increase of f x in case b is likely due to the yield stress and the largest effective viscosity of the sediment bed and f x and f y are no longer symmetric about the time axis probably due to the change of the flow and stress fields induced by a change of the sediment bed rheology in short bentonite concentration needs to be high enough for the bentonite suspension to show the properties and behavior of yield stress fluid and to form a gel like structure suspension 3 36 bentonite mass fraction is sufficient for the resulting sediment to show gel like properties this finding is particularly relevant for computation simulations in choosing the proper bentonite mass fraction and selecting a more reasonable constitutive model for the sediment for case b the plate movement disrupts the gel like structure of the suspension fluidizes it and reduces its viscosity chafe and de bruyn 2005 the forces are highest in their first cycle when the suspension is in its gel like structure form and exhibits a yield stress and then reduced steeply in the second cycle when the gel like structure gets largely destroyed the forces reduce more gradually in subsequent cycles and then asymptotically to a stable value when the gel like structure is fully destroyed and extra resistance is induced by a vanishing yield stress when the plate moves in the clay sediment water column its movement destroys the gel like structure of the sediment and disperses the clay particles into the water fig 7 the force measurements are highest in the first cycle then reduced steeply in the second cycle and gradually in subsequent cycles from the 5th cycles however as the amount of clay particles dispersed into the water increases the forces start to slightly increase fig 6 the runs are repeated three times with a resting time of two days fig 9 shows the force readings for three different runs after the 1st cycle the gel like structure is destroyed leading to a reducing and stabilizing of the force values in the next cycles after 15 repeated cycles this gel like structure may be considered as totally destroyed and the bentonite suspension fully fluidized when the bentonite suspension is left resting for more than two days its gel like structure is recovered and the suspension properties return to their original values chafe and de bruyn 2005 when the plate moves in the clay sediment water column because the dispersed clay particles there are two layers in the tank after the first run the top layer is milky in appearance represents water with dispersed clay particles the bottom layer is the remaining bentonite suspension whose gel like structure has not been destroyed by the moving plate after more than two days in the tank there are three layers the top layer is water with some dispersed clay particles the middle layer is emulsion like a mixture of water and clay particles and the bottom layer is the clay suspension as before because the gel like structure of the material in the tank has not been recovered fig 8 the force measurements in the second and third run are close to each other but different to those in the first run the force values do not change much between the second the third and subsequent cycles fig 9 this observation indicates that once the gel like structure of clay sediment is destroyed it would not be reformed and once the clay particles are dispersed into the water these particles would be in the water for a long time therefore if the harvester disturbed the clay sediment on the seabed the dispersed clay particles would remain in the water and spread further in the surrounding environment a comparison of the measured forces for two different plate moving speeds v 1 0 1 m s and v 2 0 13 m s is shown in fig 10 when the bentonite suspension or the clay sediment is just well mixed the force values are higher with higher plate speed we expect the horizontal force for a plate moving in a newtonian fluid to scale with the square of the speed giving the force ratio at two different speeds to be about v 2 v 1 2 0 13 0 10 2 1 69 in this experiment the measured maximum horizontal force ratios for a plate moving in water 1 56 well mixed bentonite suspension 1 60 and mixed clay sediment 1 60 are in broad agreement with the newtonian fluid theory case 1 2 and 5 in table 1 when the bentonite suspension or the clay sediment is rested for two days the force values for the first cycle are quite close to each other for two different plate moving speeds the measured maximum horizontal forces ratios for the first cycle are 0 93 for rested bentonite suspension and 1 20 for rested clay sediment case 3 and 4 in table 1 for the first cycle of these runs the bentonite suspension or clay sediment is in gel like structure state these measured forces are the forces required to overcome the yield stress at zero velocity jossic and magnin 2001 and can vary significantly depending on how long the material has been previously left at rest coussot 2014 in short the measured force ratios are different between well mixed and rested bentonite suspension or clay sediment the state of the sediment fluidity or gel like structure affects this ratio in chafe and de bruyn 2005 the authors measured the drag force on a sphere moving slowly through a 6 well mixed bentonite suspension for 15 cycles they found that the drag force increases with each cycle due to the material s properties change possibly due to thixotropy we do not observe this in this experiment with 3 36 well mixed bentonite suspension the horizontal force changes very little over 15 cycles after being well mixed the gel like structure slowly recovers over time through the electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged face and the positively charged edge of the bentonite platelets and through face to face and edge to edge interactions through long range electrostatic double layer repulsion choo and bai 2015 the bentonite concentration affects the length of time required for the gel like structure to obtain maximum strength abu jdayil 2011 with 6 bentonite concentration the gel like structure reforms fast enough to have the drag force increase with each cycle while the gel like structure takes longer time to reform with 3 36 bentonite suspension so that the measured horizontal force hardly changes over fifteen cycles fig 4 in the experiment with a sand bed each experimental run consists of only one cycle and each case is repeated three times the measured force values are averaged with time for each cycle and over three experimental runs fig 11 shows the force acting on the 45 degree inclined plate moving in the sand bed the force acting on the plate is many times larger than that for the clay sediment when the plate speed is 0 10 m s and 0 13 m s the averaged total force acting on the plate moving in the sand bed is 283 n and 434 n respectively fig 11 while the average total force acting on the plate moving in the clay sediment is only 3 12 n and 3 86 n respectively fig 10 the dry sand s bulk density is 1500 kg m3 much larger than bentonite suspension density which is slightly larger than water the wetted sand also has a much higher viscosity than the 2 bentonite clay sediment in the water tank the higher density and viscosity of sand leads to higher force on the moving plate than in the case of clay suspensions there are three angles are considered here fig 12 by increasing the plate speed the force is also increased fig 13 shows the averaged total force value under different plate speeds and angles the force for a 45 degree inclined plate is higher than that for a 30 degree inclined plate and the force for a 60 degree inclined plate is higher than that for a 45 degree inclined plate the results demonstrate that the interaction force between the moving plate and the seabed not only depends on the plate moving speeds and the plate inclined angles but also on the seabed material sand or clay sediment their material properties and their states gel like structure or fluidity which depends on the resting time a seabed composed of fine sand may lead to a greater force than a seabed of clay sediment clay sediment in gel like suspension is expected to give a greater force than a fluidized suspension therefore in designing seabed nodule harvester the kind of seabed material and its properties will play a significant role visual observation when the plate moves in a clay sediment and in a sand bed also shows different behaviors sand particles settle down quickly after two days while clay particles settle down at a slower speed and form emulsion layer on top of the sediment bed after two days there are still dispersed clay particles in the water fig 8 these dispersed sediment particles are expected to be carried away by a convected flow process much further downstream than the dispersed sand particles 4 conclusions an experimental study on the interaction between a moving plate and a clay sediment bed and a sand bed in a water tank has been carried out experiment results show that for a high enough mass fraction the bentonite suspension used as a modelled sediment displays a yield stress behavior and indeed a gel like structure suspension sand being non cohesive in nature gives a much greater acting force on the plate than bentonite sediment gel like structure clay suspension gives a much greater force than fluidized suspension once dispersed into water sand particles quickly settle while clay particles take a longer time to settle and form an emulsion layer on top of the sediment the interaction force between the moving plate and seabed depends not only on the plate speeds the plate inclined angles but also on the seabed material and its properties and its state gel like or fluidized our experiment data have been used to validate a smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph two phase mixture model bertevas et al 2019 and
