7230,diffuse agricultural pollution is widely recognized as a significant threat to the quality of water resources metaldehyde is a soluble synthetic aldehyde pesticide used globally in agriculture which has caused recent concern due to high observed levels exceeding the european and uk standards for pesticides in drinking water value of 0 1 µg l in surface waters utilized for potable water supply this paper describes the development of a new travel time based physically distributed metaldehyde prediction model which aims to describe the short term fluctuations of metaldehyde concentrations in surface waters caused by rainfall runoff events this will enable water infrastructure operators to consider informed control decisions in order to improve the quality of abstracted surface water the methodology is developed and trailed within a case study catchment in the uk the new approach integrates spatially and temporally disaggregated surface runoff generation routing and build up wash off concepts using a simple structure in a gis environment to build a metaldehyde concentration prediction model the use of 1 km2 resolution radar rainfall data and identification of high risk areas in the catchment provide an approach which considers the spatio temporal variations of pollutant generation and transport in the catchment the model is calibrated and validated using available catchment flow and a new metaldehyde concentration dataset acquired using automatic samplers over four rainfall events an average coefficient of determination and model efficiency of 0 75 and 0 46 respectively have been obtained for the rainfall events used to validate the model this shows the capability of the model for the intended purpose of predicting the arrival of peak metaldehyde concentrations at surface water abstraction sites and informing abstraction decisions keywords metaldehyde diffuse pollution modelling rainfall runoff surface water quality water resources 1 introduction diffuse pollution is a significant threat to the quality of surface water systems with agricultural runoff commonly recognised as posing the greatest risk grayson et al 2008 observed levels of diffuse agricultural pollutants in surface water have increased as pesticide application rates have intensified detection methods have improved and new products emerge onto the market loucks et al 2005 the characteristic behavior of some of these pollutants e g pesticides such as metaldehyde mean that existing drinking water treatment processes are inadequate to reduce levels to within drinking water regulation limits and thus have recently become a recognized problem to water infrastructure operators lu et al 2017 d arcy et al 1998 recommends that efforts to tackle diffuse pollution problems are best taken at catchment scale as promoted by the water framework directive to help avoid the need for energy and cost intensive engineered treatment solutions however the complex nature of the processes involved in diffuse pollutant generation and transport in rainfall runoff along with high temporal and spatial variations in pesticide application and rainfall runoff events pose challenges for the development and establishment of accurate and reliable modelling and mitigation strategies ouyang et al 2017 current understanding of short term pollutant dynamics in catchments caused by rainfall runoff processes is limited due to the scarce availability of water quality data at suitable temporal resolutions bach et al 2001 the aims of this work are to 1 develop a new model to describe the fluctuation of a diffuse agricultural pollutant metaldehyde in surface waters caused by rainfall driven runoff 2 validate the model against new high resolution datasets of metaldehyde concentration within the catchment following rainfall and surface runoff events it is anticipated that the new model can be used to forecast metaldehyde concentrations in surface waters and inform short term water abstraction decisions such that high levels of metaldehyde can be avoided metaldehyde is an organic compound with the formula ch3cho 4 and has low sorption coefficient of active ingredient to organic carbon koc value that ranges between 34 and 240 l kg 1 kay and grayson 2014 it is a soluble molluscicide that is used heavily in a range of agricultural products to control slugs and snails li et al 2010 and has a relatively long half life in soil that ranges between 3 17 and 223 days in recent years high levels of metaldehyde exceeding the european and uk standards for pesticides in drinking water value of 0 1 µg l have been observed in surface waters during the application season nfu 2013 peak concentrations in surface waters are observed particularly following rainfall events kay and grayson 2014 water quality assessments carried out by the uk water industry on more than 2300 raw water abstraction sites in england and wales have identified that 110 abstraction sites are at risk of metaldehyde pollution water uk 2013 metaldehyde is not effectively removed using conventional drinking water treatment options such as granular activated carbon and ozone due to its high inherent stability resulting from a unique molecular structure webber 2014 and is hence a particular concern for water infrastructure operators diffuse pollutants such as metaldehyde present on farmlands can enter river systems via a number of pathways including surface runoff drains and groundwater flow the dominant pathway for any particular pollutant is mainly dependent on its properties weather conditions soil type land slope and network of drains in the area bach et al 2001 however a number of studies have showed that surface runoff is the dominant pathway for most diffuse agricultural pollutants huber et al 2000 heathwaite et al 2005 huber et al 1998 bach et al 2001 migration of pollutants through erosion is considered significant only for highly adsorbing substances with koc values greater than 1000 l kg 1 kenaga 1980 hence metaldehyde tends not to be adsorbed by suspended solids and sediments due to its low koc value this suggests that the transport of metaldehyde through surface runoff in dissolved form is more significant than transport via soil erosion hence the amount and rate of surface runoff generated from specific farmlands in the catchment where metaldehyde is applied combined with surface runoff travel time along flow paths are likely to be critically important in determining metaldehyde concentrations and dynamics in surface waters several studies have emphasized the significant impacts of rainfall induced surface runoff in mobilizing pesticides into streams e g vryzas et al 2009 taghavi et al 2011 du preez et al 2005 ng and clegg 1997 however studies quantifying peak pollutant loads in surface runoff and potential exposure to downstream receivers resulting from individual rainfall events are lacking due to the need for high resolution water quality datasets which are rarely available most available water quality data are in daily or coarser time resolutions that fail to capture short term fluctuations in diffuse pollution concentrations caused by individual rainfall driven runoff events lack of high resolution validation data has also limited the development of stormwater quality models that are capable of predicting pollutant concentrations in surface runoff at small time intervals and hence be utilised in abstraction management systems the use of automatic water samplers has been identified as a step forward towards addressing this problem berenzen et al 2005 rabiet et al 2010 in this study automatic samplers were used to collect hourly surface water samples following rainfall events within a uk catchment known to be vulnerable to high metaldehyde concentrations this enabled the validation of a new operationally suitable stormwater quality prediction model within the catchment the new model aims to enable the prediction of short term fluctuations in metaldehyde concentrations arriving at a surface water abstraction site which is used for drinking water supply whilst a complete understanding of the transport and fate of pesticide in catchments requires consideration of numerous processes such as groundwater transport and reaction degradation processes the nature of the organic compound metaldehyde as well as the focus on forecasting short term fluctuations in response to rainfall events lead us to propose a modelling approach based on the aggregation of overland surface flow travel times over the catchment allowing a simpler and more practical model structure than a model incorporating numerous longer term processes such as groundwater transport or erosion the model is therefore based on the identification and routing of spatially distributed metaldehyde loads in surface runoff using build up wash off and surface runoff travel time techniques the approach proposed here provides an improvement to existing stormwater quality models by using high resolution radar rainfall data and identifying application risk areas in the catchment which enables the consideration of spatio temporal variations of pollutant generation and transport in the catchment a raster based data structure is employed in the model and thus various spatially distributed catchment characteristics such as elevation soil type land use and rainfall are described in the model using grids the use of the developed model in water supply catchments can help to quantify potential exposures to peak metaldehyde concentrations at surface water abstraction sites with the aim of enabling better surface water abstraction management given the inadequacy of existing water treatment processes in removing metaldehyde smarter abstraction management informed by predicted arrival of peak pollutant levels at abstraction sites proposed in this study provides a cost effective and sustainable solution to tackle problems caused by diffuse pollutants 2 methodology this section describes the study catchment as well as the development of a new process based metaldehyde transport model to forecast short term fluxes of metaldehyde in surface waters in response to individual rainfall events the catchment is divided into five square metre grid cells and surface runoff generation routing and pollutant wash off is calculated within each cell in response to time series rainfall data collected using radar the model is calibrated and validated using monitored flow data as well as new high resolution datasets of metaldehyde concentrations collected following rainfall events using automatic samplers 2 1 study area the study area river leam catchment is located in the sub basin of river severn in central england and drains an area of 300 km2 fig 1 elevation within the catchment ranges from 46 m to 232 m above sea level with mean annual rainfall of 649 mm a uk environment agency flow gauging station is situated at the outlet of the catchment to monitor abstraction license restrictions the normal flow depth of the river leam at the gauging station ranges between 0 24 m and 1 16 m with an average flow of 1 55 m3 s the most dominant land cover type within the catchment is arable farmland consisting of horticultural plants and cereals managed grassland is the second most common land use type with few urban suburban and rural developments in the catchment hence agriculture is an important land use in the catchment and is likely to have a significant influence on river water quality the predominant soil types in the catchment are clayey and loamy soils which make up approximately 65 5 of the total area clay soils are vulnerable to compaction and they remain wet for longer periods and have slow natural drainage leading to sheet runoff as opposed to channel erosion the remainder of the catchment consists of freely draining slightly acid loamy soils or loamy and clayey soils which are not seasonally wet but suffer from impeded drainage the largest use of surface water in the catchment is for public water supply a surface water abstraction site located at the outlet of the study catchment is used by a water utility operator to pump water to impounding reservoirs for water supply purposes fig 1 the main water quality issues in the catchment are nutrients and pesticides from diffuse sources metaldehyde is typically applied in the catchment on arable farmlands that grow winter crops such as winter wheat potatoes and oilseed rape which usually cover about one third of the catchment area rotated on a seasonal basis favorable conditions for slugs during the usually wet autumn and winter seasons mean that metaldehyde applications are typically made during september to december period routine monitoring conducted by the local water infrastructure operator shows that high levels of metaldehyde are present in the river during the application season fig 2 the analyses in the current study focus on data collected in the catchment during the metaldehyde application season over the period of 2014 2017 2 2 development of metaldehyde prediction model the model presented in this paper is comprised of three components surface runoff generation surface runoff routing and pollutant build up wash off surface runoff is calculated based on overland flow generated from each 5 m2 grid cell in the catchment during monitored rainfall events the travel time based surface runoff routing method estimates storm runoff transport from catchment grid cells to the outlet of the catchment based on geographic information system gis tools the spatially distributed time variant direct runoff travel time technique employed in the model accounts for spatial and temporal variability of runoff generation and flow routing through overland flows and stream networks melesse and graham 2004 du et al 2009 following rainfall events at a 1 hr resolution the pollutant model estimates metaldehyde build up through pesticide applications on identified metaldehyde high risk areas and its wash off to water courses during surface runoff processes the travel time based surface runoff routing and build up wash off models are integrated to enable rainfall event based prediction of metaldehyde concentrations at the catchment outlet 2 2 1 runoff generation the differential form of the soil conservation service scs curve number cn method mancini and rosso 1989 is used to compute spatially distributed excess rainfall in each grid cell within the study catchment the scs cn surface runoff volume prediction method was originally developed by the united states department of agriculture usda soil conservation service hjelmfelt 1991 detailed procedures of the method were originally documented in the national engineering handbook sect 4 hydrology neh 4 in 1956 and subsequently revised in 1964 1971 1985 1993 and 2004 li et al 2015 it is a widely used well established technique owing to its computational simplicity and use of accessible catchment data the differential form of the scs cn method to calculate cumulative excess rainfall depth i t mm at timestep t from each grid cell is given by 1 i t p t 0 2 s 2 p t 0 8 s when p t 0 2 s where p t mm is the cumulative depth of rainfall at timestep t calculated as 2 p t i 1 t p i δ t where pi is the rainfall intensity at the timestep i mm s δt is time step length s s is the maximum soil retention potential mm given by s 25400 cn 254 where cn is curve number ranging between 1 100 when p t 0 2 s rainfall is completely absorbed by soils with no overland flow generation and hence resulting in zero runoff depth initial cn values for each study year were first determined based on hydrologic soil group hsg land use and hydrologic conditions data mishra and singh 1999 in addition to the soil type which mainly identifies the soil water retention capacity antecedent moisture condition plays an important role in runoff generation crespo et al 2011 in the scs cn method the effect of soil moisture on runoff generation is incorporated by adjusting cn values based on antecedent moisture condition amc categories no exclusive relations or formulas are available to calculate soil moisture from antecedent rainfalls of certain preceding days but in general the term antecedent for soil moisture calculation purpose is taken to vary from preceding 5 30 days usda 1986 amc categories in this study were determined for each rainfall event based on cumulative rainfall volumes of the preceding 5 days the three amc categories are amc i for dry amc ii for normal and amc iii for wet conditions initially assigned cn values are adjusted for each rainfall event based on their amc categories to account for the effect of soil moisture on runoff generation fig 3 shows cn values based on normal antecedent moisture condition amc ii for the 2014 application season the spatially distributed cn values combined with the use of radar rainfall data see section 2 3 2 enable the computation of spatially distributed runoff depths the surface runoff rate q t mm s from each grid cell at time step t can be calculated using 3 q t i t i t 1 δ t 2 2 2 runoff routing in natural conditions over land and channel travel times vary based on availability of runoff and rainfall variation in time this is accounted in the model by employing a time variant travel time computation technique to determine flow pathways a gis flow direction tool was used to determine the steepest decent from every cell in the catchment digital elevation model dem this created unique connections between cells that defined flow paths to the catchment outlet and identifed storm runoff flow networks in the catchment a threshold number was set to identify cells with high flow contributing areas that form concentrated flow and these were used to delineate channel networks in the catchment du et al 2009 the delineated channel network density and extents were compared with stream networks from topographic maps to adjust threshold number of cells any cell with less upstream flow contributing cells than the threshold was considered as overland flow cell and others with more flow contributing upstream cells were classified as channel cells travel time computation techniques were then employed to determine travel time for each overland and channel flow cells based on available runoff in the cells and other hydraulic parameters cumulative travel times through each pathway computed from topographic data were used to route excess rainfall from each grid cell along flow paths to determine surface runoff hydrographs at the outlet of the catchment first kinematic wave theories suggested by wong 1995 2003 were used to derive travel time expressions for each grid cell depending on its classification i e overland flow cell or channel cell for an overland flow grid cell with negligible flow backwater effect the wave celerity c travelling down the grid cell was derived using kinematic wave equation given by eagleson 1970 4 c dx dt α β y β 1 where α and β are parameters used in q α y β to relate discharge per unit width q to flow depth y and x is distance along the direction of flow re writing eq 4 in terms of discharge per unit width q gives 5 c dx dt α 1 β β q 1 1 β for small period of time it can be assumed that overland grid cells receive constant and uniform excess rainfall intensity i and constant upstream inflow q u thus the unit discharge at the downstream end of the grid cell over that period can be calculated as 6 q q u ix assuming α is independent of x substituting eq 6 in eq 5 and solving the derivatives in eq 5 for t gives an expression for time of concentration for overland grid cells as 7 t c 1 α 1 β q u il 1 β q u 1 β i where t c the time of concentration and l is the length of the grid cell in the direction of flow in general overland flow concentration time for small grid cell areas such as used in this study are shorter than duration of excess rainfalls and eq 7 can thus be used to calculate travel time the time of concentration formula can be written as 8 t c li 1 β α 1 β λ 1 1 β λ 1 β where λ relates upstream inflow and influx from excess rainfall as follows 9 λ q u il values of friction parameters α and β can be obtained using manning s equation as α s n and β 5 3 respectively thus the expression for overland flow time of concentration from eq 8 can be written as 10 t c 7 nl s 0 5 0 6 i 0 4 λ 1 0 6 λ 0 6 where the units of parameters in eqs 9 and 10 above are given as minutes for t c m m for s m2 s for q u mm h for i and m for l manning s n values vary depending on the types of surface and can be selected from values recommended by engman 1986 the equivalent of eq 8 for channel flow grid cells with negligible backwater effect a constant upstream inflow and a uniform lateral inflow is given as 11 t tc l c α c q l β c 1 1 β c λ c 1 1 β c λ c 1 β c where t tc is time of concentration l c is the length of the channel cell in flow direction q l is the uniform lateral inflow α c and β c are parameters relating the discharge q in the channel to the flow area a and λ c relates the upstream inflow q u to the lateral inflow q l as follows 12 q α c a β c 13 λ c q u q l l c replacing α c s n and β c 5 3 friction parameter values determined from manning s equation and uniform lateral inflow q l il c in eq 11 above gives the channel flow time of concentration as 14 t tc 7 nl c s 0 5 0 6 il c 0 4 λ 1 0 6 λ 0 6 where the units of parameters in eqs 13 and 14 above are given as minutes for t tc m m for s m3 s for q u mm h for i and m for l c to account for uncertainties introduced during estimation of travel time calibration parameters k o and k c are included in eqs 15 and 16 as shown below to determine travel time in overland t c and channel flow t tc respectively 15 t c 7 k o nl s 0 5 0 6 i 0 4 λ 1 0 6 λ 0 6 16 t tc 7 k c nl c s 0 5 0 6 il c 0 4 λ 1 0 6 λ 0 6 the value of k o and k c parameters are determined by calibration finally travel times calculated for each grid cells using eqs 15 and 16 above are summed along flow paths at each model timestep to determine cumulative travel time of surface runoff from each grid cell to the catchment outlet 2 2 3 pollutant model the pollutant model estimates metaldehyde build up on high risk areas during dry days and wash off to water courses during surface runoff following rainfall events metaldehyde risk areas in the catchment have been identified based on available land use data which provides information on the likelihood of metaldehyde being applied to the land based on crop type during each growing season land growing winter crops such as winter wheat potatoes and oilseed rape where metaldehyde is commonly applied are identified as high risk areas data on land use derived from satellite imagery was acquired from the centre for ecology and hydrology for each growing season used in the analysis 2014 2017 fig 4 shows the identified high risk areas for the 2014 season metaldehyde application doses on these high risk areas and frequency of applications over pesticide application periods determine the accumulation of metaldehyde in the active zone at soil surfaces müller et al 2003 moreover the time interval between metaldehyde application and a rainfall event directly affects the amount of metaldehyde transported to water bodies through surface runoff these processes are represented using build up and wash off components in the model pollutant build up metaldehyde build up on high risk areas occur through application of pesticides that contain metaldehyde as an active ingredient wet conditions during winter provide an ideal environment for slugs to thrive and most metaldehyde applications are made during this period to protect winter crops typical single slug pellet application based on guidelines from manufacturers is 5 kg ha this is equivalent to 75 g hectare 0 19 g per 5 m2 grid size used in this study of metaldehyde based on a commonly used 1 5 slug pellet the statutory legal requirement in the uk on metaldehyde application states that total application in a calendar year should not exceed a maximum of 700 g ha routine monitoring data collected by the local water infrastructure operator shows that almost all high levels of metaldehyde in the river have occurred during the september to december application season fig 2 thus it can be assumed that most of the 700 g ha statuary annual legal limit of metaldehyde is applied during the september to december application period based on this assumption and the typical single metaldehyde application value of 75 g ha a total of not more than nine applications are expected during the winter crop growing season on any particular high risk farmland this combined with the relatively long half life of metaldehyde in soil suggest that metaldehyde presence on farmlands during this period is likely to be consistently high castle et al 2017 in this study it was initially assumed that metaldehyde was applied on all high risk areas 5 days before rainfall events which was later adjusted using a calibration parameter pollutant wash off metaldehyde wash off is dependent on a number of rainfall catchment and substance characteristics in this study pesticide loss equation based on the simplified formula for indirect loadings caused by runoff sfil berenzen et al 2005 reus et al 1999 is used to calculate percentage loss of metaldehyde at each timestep from high risk areas through runoff 17 l t q t p t fe t n ln 2 dt 50 soil 100 1 k d where l t percentage of application dose that

coefficient of active ingredient to organic carbon oc mass fraction of soil organic carbon content in percent runoff rate qt at each model timestep and total precipitation depth pt for each high risk cell are obtained from eqs 2 and 3 and from rainfall data the use of parameter koc in equation 17 above has some limitations as it generally refers to sorption coefficient of pesticides into soil organic matrix and doesn t take into account adsorptions to clay particles which is present in the study area however metaldehydes low koc value and solubility mean that this limitation is likely to have an insignificant impact on model outputs as peak metaldehyde concentrations are likely to be mainly due to metaldehyde transport in dissolved form the amount of metaldehyde available at soil surfaces during a rainfall event which is determined by applications and the number of days between applications and a rainfall event has significant impact on the overall wash off load that dissolves in surface runoff however lack of data on the specific timing of metaldehyde application makes this difficult to determine consequently build up and wash off rate parameters are difficult to be inferred from direct measurements in the catchment and are known to commonly introduce uncertainties in pollutant prediction models wijesiri et al 2016 to account for these uncertainties in the estimation of metaldehyde build up and wash off an additional parameter k which depends on initial metaldehyde concentrations c o in the river at the outlet of the catchment prior to rainfall events was used in the model the metaldehyde concentration trend in the river prior to a rainfall event provides a general indication of the level of metaldehyde application in the catchment during a particular pesticide application period ryberg and gilliom 2015 consequently it is therefore used in this study to adjust computations of metaldehyde load in surface runoff based on measured metaldehyde presence in the catchment hence metaldehyde load in surface runoff from each high risk cell at each timestep is determined by 18 m t kl t b where m t metaldehyde load in surface runoff at timestep t g k c o k b c o is metaldehyde concentration in the river prior to each rainfall event µg l k b is a calibration parameter l µg b metaldehyde build up on soil surface through applications taken as 0 19 g per 5 square meter based on typical application of 5 kg ha using 1 5 slug pellet 2 2 4 model integration for a given rainfall event over the catchment rate of surface runoff generation and travel times are computed using eqs 3 15 and 16 sections 2 2 1 and 2 2 2 at each model timestep the calculated travel time from each high risk cell is then used to route metaldehyde load to the outlet of the catchment time series of surface runoff and metaldehyde load in surface runoff can then be used to determine metaldehyde concentrations in runoff water arriving at the outlet of the catchment metaldehyde transport in ground water is not included in the modelling structure and thus a measured metaldehyde concentration in the river prior to a rainfall event is used to indicate base flow concentration metaldehyde concentrations in base flow co during the storm runoff period is assumed to be constant whereas a constant slope method is used to increase the amount of base flow qb over the runoff period blume et al 2007 these are then combined with time series of simulated concentrations in runoff and quantity of runoff water to determine total metaldehyde concentrations in the river accurate estimation of the arrival time of peak metaldehyde concentration at the abstraction site is important in terms of enabling smarter surface water abstraction management to avoid peak metaldehyde concentrations thus time to peak δt prediction error of peak flow δpf and concentration δpc are used to evaluate the model performance along with other commonly used criteria as shown in section 3 1 and 3 2 farmland in the study catchment that have high likelihood of metaldehyde being applied metaldehyde high risk areas are spread out in the catchment with some parts of the catchment containing more high risk areas than others the metaldehyde concentration at the catchment outlet over a specific time period is heavily dependent on the density of high risk areas within the relevant travel time isochrones fig 5 shows surface runoff travel time from 2015 high risk areas computed based on a constant and uniform rainfall intensity of 1 mm hr applied for 1 h over the whole catchment the sum of histograms in fig 5 is found to be 74 7 km2 which is in good agreement with the sum of the total high risk areas in the catchment 74 5 km2 high rates of runoff generation from high risk areas increases metaldehyde levels in the river whereas high rate of runoff generation from low risk areas have a dilution effect and can lower concentration of metaldehyde in the river thus metaldehyde concentration at the outlet of the catchment significantly depends on spatial variability of a rainfall event in relation to the distribution of high risk areas 2 3 model input calibration and verification data 2 3 1 land use soil type and dem land use soil type and dem of the catchment were pre processed to derive various spatial input datasets to the model direct model inputs derived from these data are land slope flow direction flow accumulation length of flow pathways manning s coefficients n curve numbers cn and high risk areas a vector layer of land use which was derived from satellite imagery was obtained from the centre for ecology and hydrology uk for each study year the land use map classifies crop types and grassland at field level and was used to assign metaldehyde high risk areas section 2 2 3 as well as manning s roughness coefficient n values for each grid cells based on values published in the literature montes 1998 brater and king 1976 manning s roughness values assigned for overland surfaces varied between 0 06 and 0 15 whereas roughness values assigned for channel surfaces based on the nature of the channels varied between 0 035 and 0 04 the spatially distributed manning s coefficient values and high risk areas were changed for each study year based on changes in land use in the catchment the soil map for the study catchment was obtained from the uk national soil resources institute nsri database nsri 2009 for the calculation of curve numbers see section 2 2 1 soils in the catchment were categorized into four hydrologic soil groups a d based on the soil s runoff generating potential usda 1986 hydrologic soil group a generally has the lowest runoff potential and group d has the highest potential hydrologic parameters for the calculation of runoff such as slope flow direction flow accumulation drainage basin and stream network delineation were derived in arcgis using os terrain 5 digital elevation model which was obtained from ordnance survey uk 2 3 2 rainfall radar rainfall data was acquired from the uk met office s nimrod system with spatial and temporal resolution of 1 km2 and 5 min respectively met office 2003 the radar rainfall data was resampled to a 5 m2 grid and aggregated to one hour resolution to match with the model grid and time resolution this was used as input data for the calculation of runoff generation and pollutant wash off see sections 2 2 1 and 2 2 3 initially four rainfall events in the catchment were selected to calibrate and validate the travel time based surface runoff model developed in this study summary statistics and temporally averaged spatial variation of each rainfall event are provided in table 1 and fig 6 below the temporal variations of each rainfall event are presented in fig 8 significant rainfall events with a range of rainfall intensity and durations were selected to represent rainfall conditions that are likely to cause metaldehyde spikes at the outlet of the catchment historical radar rainfall data was used to compute antecedent soil moisture conditions for each grid cell and this were used to adjust grid cell curve number values following the validation of the runoff model radar rainfall data observed during the four metaldehyde data collection events were used to drive the metaldehyde prediction model simulations summary statistics and temporally averaged spatial variation of each rainfall event used for calibration and validation of the metaldehyde prediction model are provided in table 2 and fig 7 below the temporal variations of each rainfall event are presented in fig 9 2 3 3 flow historical hourly flow data from a flow gauging station situated at the outlet of the catchment was obtained from the uk environment agency the flow hydrographs for each rainfall events were separated into base flow and direct runoff using straight line method reddy 2006 a straight line is drawn from the point where the sharp rise in hydrograph occurs to the end of recession limb which is used to separate the hydrograph into two distinct components a fast intermittent runoff response and a slow continuous base flow response of the catchment the fast response runoff hydrographs resulting from the selected rainfall events table 1 were used to calibrate and validate the surface runoff model 2 3 4 water sampling and metaldehyde data water samples were collected from river leam using auto samplers installed at surface water abstraction site used for drinking water supply the use of auto samplers enabled the continuous collection of hourly water samples during storm runoff events which successfully captured the short term fluctuations of metaldehyde concentrations at the abstraction site the auto samplers were manually triggered before the arrival of forecasted rainfall events which were judged likely to cause metaldehyde peaks due to surface runoff for each event sampling was carried out for a period of 3 5 days which enabled the acquisition of water samples during the full surface runoff period following the rainfall events the data collection campaign was carried out over a period of three metaldehyde application seasons between september 2014 and february 2017 collected water samples were analysed in laboratory to determine metaldehyde concentrations details on the metaldehyde detection method used are provided by li et al 2010 3 results and discussion this section presents the calibration and verification results of surface runoff and metaldehyde concentration prediction models for the rainfall events presented in tables 1 and 2 comparison of simulated model results with measured flow data at the catchment outlet and metaldehyde concentration data from four water quality sampling events are discussed using various error statistics 3 1 surface runoff model the performance of metaldehyde prediction model is dependent on surface runoff travel times from high risk areas to the outlet of the catchment thus the surface runoff model which consists of surface runoff generation and runoff routing components needs to be calibrated and validated before it is integrated to the pollutant build up wash off model flow data recorded by a gauging station located at the outlet of the catchment is acquired from environment agency and is used to calibrate and validate the travel time computation technique used in the surface runoff model runoff generation and transport from the entire catchment is considered for the calibration and verification of the surface runoff computation approach observed flow data from rainfall event a1 was used to calibrate parameters k o and k c eqs 15 and 16 used in the computation of travel times in over land and channel flow cells respectively simulation of the runoff prediction model was carried out using eleven different combinations of k o and k c values table 3 the performance of the surface runoff model was evaluated using the prediction error of peak flow rate δpf prediction error of time to peak δt and volume conservation index vci which was calculated using equation 19 in addition the overall model prediction efficiency over the entire hydrograph was evaluated using model efficiency coefficient e as shown in eq 20 19 vci t 1 t q m t t 1 t q o t 20 e 1 t 1 t q m t q o t 2 t 1 t q o t q o 2 where q m t is predicted flow at discrete times t m3 s q o t is observed flow at discrete times t m3 s and q o is mean of observed flow values over the entire period m3 s the runoff model prediction results and error statistics for rainfall event a1 which was used for model calibration are summarized in table 3 the volume conservation index vci for rainfall event a1 is found to be 0 87 the results indicated that k c 1 and k o 0 8 provide the optimum solution considering all the four evaluation criteria the calibrated parameter value of kc 1 shows that the manning s roughness coefficient values assigned to channels based on values from literature and other parameters used to compute channel travel time required no adjustment overall the calibration results showed that model performance in predicting surface runoff is more sensitive to the computation of channel travel time than overland travel time these calibrated parameter values were used to make surface runoff model simulations for the three remaining rainfall events table 4 summarizes the results of model simulation and error statistics for the three rainfall events used for surface runoff model validation it was observed that model simulations of all three rainfall events have efficiencies greater than 0 80 and prediction error of peak flow rate less than 10 in addition volume conservation index of more than 80 and time to peak error of less than 6 h have been observed for all rainfall events with an average efficiency of 0 87 for the rainfall events used for validation the overall performance of the calibrated travel time based surface runoff model can be considered reasonable the surface runoff model performed better for rainfall events with higher amc as compared to rainfall events with low amc comparison of observed and simulated surface runoff hydrographs for all four rainfall events are shown in fig 8 fig 8 also shows the spatially averaged rainfall over the catchment in general the levels of error statistics observed are practically acceptable and predicted surface runoff hydrographs agree well with the simulated hydrographs consequently the calibrated travel time approach can be used for estimation of metaldehyde transport from high risk areas in the catchment 3 2 metaldehyde prediction model the rainfall event based operation of the automatic samplers to collect hourly water samples enabled the capture of high resolution metaldehyde concentrations arriving at the outlet of the catchment following rainfall events results of the analysis of metaldehyde concentrations from the collected water quality samples for each event are presented in fig 9 the analysis shows that relatively short lived metaldehyde peaks with event durations ranging from 12 48 h occur following rainfall events fig 9 the size and nature of these short lived metaldehyde spikes are highly variable between events for example recorded metaldehyde concentrations rise by approximately 500 during event b2 but only by 150 during event b3 however averaged rainfall is of the same order of magnitude for both events the datasets therefore emphasise that runoff generation from high risk areas has a significant impact on metaldehyde concentrations in the catchment surface waters and that pollutant dynamics is highly sensitive to temporal and spatial distributions of rainfall and land use moreover soil type on the land where metaldehyde is applied combined with chemical characteristics of metaldehyde such as solubility and sorption coefficient play an important role in the process of mobilizing metaldehyde into water courses the metaldehyde concentration prediction model represents metaldehyde transport in surface runoff from high risk areas in the catchment by coupling the travel time technique calibrated in section 3 1 with build up wash off component this enabled forecasting of metaldehyde concentration levels following rainfall events at the outlet of the catchment where the surface water abstraction site is located metaldehyde concentration data collected over data collection event b1 was used to calibrate the value of parameter k b which was used to account for uncertainties associated with the estimation of metaldehyde build up and wash off rate different values of parameter k b ranging from 1 to 3 5 were set in the metaldehyde prediction model to simulate metaldehyde concentrations during data collection event b1 the model performance was evaluated using four criteria i e prediction error of time to peak concentration δtc prediction error of peak metaldehyde concentration δpc coefficient of determination r of observed and simulated metaldehyde concentrations and model prediction efficiency e however due to the assumption of uniform application of metaldehyde on all high risk areas section 2 2 3 changes in parameter kb result in an overall proportional increase or decrease of predicted metaldehyde concentrations across the prediction period hence calibration has no impact on the proportion of the variances between predicted and observed concentrations as a result coefficient of determination r values between predicted and observed concentrations are found to be insensitive to changes in parameter kb the metaldehyde prediction model results for data collection event b1 and associated error statistics are summarized in table 5 the results indicated that optimum solution is attained with k b 1 6 considering the remaining criteria for data collection event b1 an initial measured river concentration co value of 0 067 µg l is used for the calibration event b1 measured co values for each event used for metaldehyde model validation events are presented in table 6 3 2 1 verification metaldehyde model simulations were carried out for other three metaldehyde data collection events using calibrated parameter values table 6 summarizes model simulation results and error statistics for all three data collection events it was observed that simulations for all three events have correlation coefficients of 0 70 or more prediction error of peak metaldehyde concentration less than 5 and time to peak concentration error of 6 or less hours observed and predicted metaldehyde concentrations along with spatially averaged rainfall data are shown in fig 9 for all four data collection events in general metaldehyde concentrations are predicted well for all events with practically acceptable levels of errors in terms of both concentration levels and prediction of peak arrival times the results showed the capability of the model developed in this study for the intended practical purpose of predicting the arrival of peak metaldehyde concentrations and informing surface water abstractions discrepancies in the prediction of the peak arrival time are likely to be caused mainly by uncertainties associated with estimation of channel travel time antecedent conditions and the assumption of uniform metaldehyde application throughout the high risk areas in the catchment some of these errors may be reduced in future via the use of more calibration data and a more detailed consideration of metaldehyde applications informed by data from farmers i e real time application data 4 conclusions diffuse agricultural pollution is known to be a significant concern to the quality of surface water with implications for drinking water supply smarter management of water resources including forecasting and prediction of pollutant spikes is a possible means to avoid contamination of drinking water supplies and reduce the cost of water treatment this requires a detailed understanding of pollutant processes in the catchment in response to rainfall events the occurrence sources transport and fate of organic compounds in the environment involve a variety of processes that determine how the compounds are initially distributed move and react consequently assessing fate and transport of contaminants in the environment is a complex issue this study focuses on predicting the arrival of peak metaldehyde concentrations in surface runoff at abstraction sites with a view to inform surface water abstraction decisions hence a model has been developed to describe short term dynamics and transport primarily driven by rainfall driven runoff rather than longer term reactions degradation or groundwater processes runoff generation and routing is spatially and temporally variable and hence surface water quality responses are dependent on the spatial distribution of pesticide within the catchment a function of land use and the dynamics of individual rainfall events to date the quantification and understanding of the pollutant dynamics that drive short term fluctuations has been hindered by a paucity of high resolution water quality sampling data the physically based distributed metaldehyde prediction approach developed in this study combines surface runoff and build up wash off concepts in a gis environment enabling the full consideration of spatially and temporally variable rainfall and land use patterns model parameters and input data are extracted from radar rainfall data soil type land use and dems to address the paucity of current data we attempt to utilize automatic samplers which were triggered during rainfall events to capture the impact of forecasted rainfall events on the concentrations in surface waters the variation in the metaldehyde concentration response between the rainfall events demonstrates the importance of a full consideration of spatio temporal rainfall and metaldehyde application data in terms of practical application it is noted that the accurate forecasting of arrival time of peaks is of more value than forecasting of the peak concentration value as this enables surface water abstraction decision makings such as suspending abstractions temporarily in order to avoid the entrance of high metaldehyde levels into water supply systems given the inability of existing treatment techniques to remove high metaldehyde levels from water and the absence of direct metaldehyde detection methods the model developed in this study provides a cost effective and sustainable solution when applied to the trial catchment the model was able to predict peak concentrations to within 6 h in all tested cases given the availability of water storage infrastructure in the catchment this would enable the operator to suspend abstraction for this period to allow likely periods of high concentration to pass given the effective utilisation of storage such a suspension would not have a significant negative impact on water resources especially if abstraction was increased at other times to compensate the increasing availability of catchment scale spatial datasets combined with the relatively simple gis based application of the model makes it suitable for use in various catchments where prediction of metaldehyde exposures are required moreover in the presence of reliable spatially distributed datasets the developed approach can potentially be extended to predict exposures to other pollutants of interest at catchment scale as well as inform catchment management options future work will investigate the quantification of modelling input and parameter uncertainty on both predicted concentration levels and peak arrival times acknowledgements

7230,diffuse agricultural pollution is widely recognized as a significant threat to the quality of water resources metaldehyde is a soluble synthetic aldehyde pesticide used globally in agriculture which has caused recent concern due to high observed levels exceeding the european and uk standards for pesticides in drinking water value of 0 1 µg l in surface waters utilized for potable water supply this paper describes the development of a new travel time based physically distributed metaldehyde prediction model which aims to describe the short term fluctuations of metaldehyde concentrations in surface waters caused by rainfall runoff events this will enable water infrastructure operators to consider informed control decisions in order to improve the quality of abstracted surface water the methodology is developed and trailed within a case study catchment in the uk the new approach integrates spatially and temporally disaggregated surface runoff generation routing and build up wash off concepts using a simple structure in a gis environment to build a metaldehyde concentration prediction model the use of 1 km2 resolution radar rainfall data and identification of high risk areas in the catchment provide an approach which considers the spatio temporal variations of pollutant generation and transport in the catchment the model is calibrated and validated using available catchment flow and a new metaldehyde concentration dataset acquired using automatic samplers over four rainfall events an average coefficient of determination and model efficiency of 0 75 and 0 46 respectively have been obtained for the rainfall events used to validate the model this shows the capability of the model for the intended purpose of predicting the arrival of peak metaldehyde concentrations at surface water abstraction sites and informing abstraction decisions keywords metaldehyde diffuse pollution modelling rainfall runoff surface water quality water resources 1 introduction diffuse pollution is a significant threat to the quality of surface water systems with agricultural runoff commonly recognised as posing the greatest risk grayson et al 2008 observed levels of diffuse agricultural pollutants in surface water have increased as pesticide application rates have intensified detection methods have improved and new products emerge onto the market loucks et al 2005 the characteristic behavior of some of these pollutants e g pesticides such as metaldehyde mean that existing drinking water treatment processes are inadequate to reduce levels to within drinking water regulation limits and thus have recently become a recognized problem to water infrastructure operators lu et al 2017 d arcy et al 1998 recommends that efforts to tackle diffuse pollution problems are best taken at catchment scale as promoted by the water framework directive to help avoid the need for energy and cost intensive engineered treatment solutions however the complex nature of the processes involved in diffuse pollutant generation and transport in rainfall runoff along with high temporal and spatial variations in pesticide application and rainfall runoff events pose challenges for the development and establishment of accurate and reliable modelling and mitigation strategies ouyang et al 2017 current understanding of short term pollutant dynamics in catchments caused by rainfall runoff processes is limited due to the scarce availability of water quality data at suitable temporal resolutions bach et al 2001 the aims of this work are to 1 develop a new model to describe the fluctuation of a diffuse agricultural pollutant metaldehyde in surface waters caused by rainfall driven runoff 2 validate the model against new high resolution datasets of metaldehyde concentration within the catchment following rainfall and surface runoff events it is anticipated that the new model can be used to forecast metaldehyde concentrations in surface waters and inform short term water abstraction decisions such that high levels of metaldehyde can be avoided metaldehyde is an organic compound with the formula ch3cho 4 and has low sorption coefficient of active ingredient to organic carbon koc value that ranges between 34 and 240 l kg 1 kay and grayson 2014 it is a soluble molluscicide that is used heavily in a range of agricultural products to control slugs and snails li et al 2010 and has a relatively long half life in soil that ranges between 3 17 and 223 days in recent years high levels of metaldehyde exceeding the european and uk standards for pesticides in drinking water value of 0 1 µg l have been observed in surface waters during the application season nfu 2013 peak concentrations in surface waters are observed particularly following rainfall events kay and grayson 2014 water quality assessments carried out by the uk water industry on more than 2300 raw water abstraction sites in england and wales have identified that 110 abstraction sites are at risk of metaldehyde pollution water uk 2013 metaldehyde is not effectively removed using conventional drinking water treatment options such as granular activated carbon and ozone due to its high inherent stability resulting from a unique molecular structure webber 2014 and is hence a particular concern for water infrastructure operators diffuse pollutants such as metaldehyde present on farmlands can enter river systems via a number of pathways including surface runoff drains and groundwater flow the dominant pathway for any particular pollutant is mainly dependent on its properties weather conditions soil type land slope and network of drains in the area bach et al 2001 however a number of studies have showed that surface runoff is the dominant pathway for most diffuse agricultural pollutants huber et al 2000 heathwaite et al 2005 huber et al 1998 bach et al 2001 migration of pollutants through erosion is considered significant only for highly adsorbing substances with koc values greater than 1000 l kg 1 kenaga 1980 hence metaldehyde tends not to be adsorbed by suspended solids and sediments due to its low koc value this suggests that the transport of metaldehyde through surface runoff in dissolved form is more significant than transport via soil erosion hence the amount and rate of surface runoff generated from specific farmlands in the catchment where metaldehyde is applied combined with surface runoff travel time along flow paths are likely to be critically important in determining metaldehyde concentrations and dynamics in surface waters several studies have emphasized the significant impacts of rainfall induced surface runoff in mobilizing pesticides into streams e g vryzas et al 2009 taghavi et al 2011 du preez et al 2005 ng and clegg 1997 however studies quantifying peak pollutant loads in surface runoff and potential exposure to downstream receivers resulting from individual rainfall events are lacking due to the need for high resolution water quality datasets which are rarely available most available water quality data are in daily or coarser time resolutions that fail to capture short term fluctuations in diffuse pollution concentrations caused by individual rainfall driven runoff events lack of high resolution validation data has also limited the development of stormwater quality models that are capable of predicting pollutant concentrations in surface runoff at small time intervals and hence be utilised in abstraction management systems the use of automatic water samplers has been identified as a step forward towards addressing this problem berenzen et al 2005 rabiet et al 2010 in this study automatic samplers were used to collect hourly surface water samples following rainfall events within a uk catchment known to be vulnerable to high metaldehyde concentrations this enabled the validation of a new operationally suitable stormwater quality prediction model within the catchment the new model aims to enable the prediction of short term fluctuations in metaldehyde concentrations arriving at a surface water abstraction site which is used for drinking water supply whilst a complete understanding of the transport and fate of pesticide in catchments requires consideration of numerous processes such as groundwater transport and reaction degradation processes the nature of the organic compound metaldehyde as well as the focus on forecasting short term fluctuations in response to rainfall events lead us to propose a modelling approach based on the aggregation of overland surface flow travel times over the catchment allowing a simpler and more practical model structure than a model incorporating numerous longer term processes such as groundwater transport or erosion the model is therefore based on the identification and routing of spatially distributed metaldehyde loads in surface runoff using build up wash off and surface runoff travel time techniques the approach proposed here provides an improvement to existing stormwater quality models by using high resolution radar rainfall data and identifying application risk areas in the catchment which enables the consideration of spatio temporal variations of pollutant generation and transport in the catchment a raster based data structure is employed in the model and thus various spatially distributed catchment characteristics such as elevation soil type land use and rainfall are described in the model using grids the use of the developed model in water supply catchments can help to quantify potential exposures to peak metaldehyde concentrations at surface water abstraction sites with the aim of enabling better surface water abstraction management given the inadequacy of existing water treatment processes in removing metaldehyde smarter abstraction management informed by predicted arrival of peak pollutant levels at abstraction sites proposed in this study provides a cost effective and sustainable solution to tackle problems caused by diffuse pollutants 2 methodology this section describes the study catchment as well as the development of a new process based metaldehyde transport model to forecast short term fluxes of metaldehyde in surface waters in response to individual rainfall events the catchment is divided into five square metre grid cells and surface runoff generation routing and pollutant wash off is calculated within each cell in response to time series rainfall data collected using radar the model is calibrated and validated using monitored flow data as well as new high resolution datasets of metaldehyde concentrations collected following rainfall events using automatic samplers 2 1 study area the study area river leam catchment is located in the sub basin of river severn in central england and drains an area of 300 km2 fig 1 elevation within the catchment ranges from 46 m to 232 m above sea level with mean annual rainfall of 649 mm a uk environment agency flow gauging station is situated at the outlet of the catchment to monitor abstraction license restrictions the normal flow depth of the river leam at the gauging station ranges between 0 24 m and 1 16 m with an average flow of 1 55 m3 s the most dominant land cover type within the catchment is arable farmland consisting of horticultural plants and cereals managed grassland is the second most common land use type with few urban suburban and rural developments in the catchment hence agriculture is an important land use in the catchment and is likely to have a significant influence on river water quality the predominant soil types in the catchment are clayey and loamy soils which make up approximately 65 5 of the total area clay soils are vulnerable to compaction and they remain wet for longer periods and have slow natural drainage leading to sheet runoff as opposed to channel erosion the remainder of the catchment consists of freely draining slightly acid loamy soils or loamy and clayey soils which are not seasonally wet but suffer from impeded drainage the largest use of surface water in the catchment is for public water supply a surface water abstraction site located at the outlet of the study catchment is used by a water utility operator to pump water to impounding reservoirs for water supply purposes fig 1 the main water quality issues in the catchment are nutrients and pesticides from diffuse sources metaldehyde is typically applied in the catchment on arable farmlands that grow winter crops such as winter wheat potatoes and oilseed rape which usually cover about one third of the catchment area rotated on a seasonal basis favorable conditions for slugs during the usually wet autumn and winter seasons mean that metaldehyde applications are typically made during september to december period routine monitoring conducted by the local water infrastructure operator shows that high levels of metaldehyde are present in the river during the application season fig 2 the analyses in the current study focus on data collected in the catchment during the metaldehyde application season over the period of 2014 2017 2 2 development of metaldehyde prediction model the model presented in this paper is comprised of three components surface runoff generation surface runoff routing and pollutant build up wash off surface runoff is calculated based on overland flow generated from each 5 m2 grid cell in the catchment during monitored rainfall events the travel time based surface runoff routing method estimates storm runoff transport from catchment grid cells to the outlet of the catchment based on geographic information system gis tools the spatially distributed time variant direct runoff travel time technique employed in the model accounts for spatial and temporal variability of runoff generation and flow routing through overland flows and stream networks melesse and graham 2004 du et al 2009 following rainfall events at a 1 hr resolution the pollutant model estimates metaldehyde build up through pesticide applications on identified metaldehyde high risk areas and its wash off to water courses during surface runoff processes the travel time based surface runoff routing and build up wash off models are integrated to enable rainfall event based prediction of metaldehyde concentrations at the catchment outlet 2 2 1 runoff generation the differential form of the soil conservation service scs curve number cn method mancini and rosso 1989 is used to compute spatially distributed excess rainfall in each grid cell within the study catchment the scs cn surface runoff volume prediction method was originally developed by the united states department of agriculture usda soil conservation service hjelmfelt 1991 detailed procedures of the method were originally documented in the national engineering handbook sect 4 hydrology neh 4 in 1956 and subsequently revised in 1964 1971 1985 1993 and 2004 li et al 2015 it is a widely used well established technique owing to its computational simplicity and use of accessible catchment data the differential form of the scs cn method to calculate cumulative excess rainfall depth i t mm at timestep t from each grid cell is given by 1 i t p t 0 2 s 2 p t 0 8 s when p t 0 2 s where p t mm is the cumulative depth of rainfall at timestep t calculated as 2 p t i 1 t p i δ t where pi is the rainfall intensity at the timestep i mm s δt is time step length s s is the maximum soil retention potential mm given by s 25400 cn 254 where cn is curve number ranging between 1 100 when p t 0 2 s rainfall is completely absorbed by soils with no overland flow generation and hence resulting in zero runoff depth initial cn values for each study year were first determined based on hydrologic soil group hsg land use and hydrologic conditions data mishra and singh 1999 in addition to the soil type which mainly identifies the soil water retention capacity antecedent moisture condition plays an important role in runoff generation crespo et al 2011 in the scs cn method the effect of soil moisture on runoff generation is incorporated by adjusting cn values based on antecedent moisture condition amc categories no exclusive relations or formulas are available to calculate soil moisture from antecedent rainfalls of certain preceding days but in general the term antecedent for soil moisture calculation purpose is taken to vary from preceding 5 30 days usda 1986 amc categories in this study were determined for each rainfall event based on cumulative rainfall volumes of the preceding 5 days the three amc categories are amc i for dry amc ii for normal and amc iii for wet conditions initially assigned cn values are adjusted for each rainfall event based on their amc categories to account for the effect of soil moisture on runoff generation fig 3 shows cn values based on normal antecedent moisture condition amc ii for the 2014 application season the spatially distributed cn values combined with the use of radar rainfall data see section 2 3 2 enable the computation of spatially distributed runoff depths the surface runoff rate q t mm s from each grid cell at time step t can be calculated using 3 q t i t i t 1 δ t 2 2 2 runoff routing in natural conditions over land and channel travel times vary based on availability of runoff and rainfall variation in time this is accounted in the model by employing a time variant travel time computation technique to determine flow pathways a gis flow direction tool was used to determine the steepest decent from every cell in the catchment digital elevation model dem this created unique connections between cells that defined flow paths to the catchment outlet and identifed storm runoff flow networks in the catchment a threshold number was set to identify cells with high flow contributing areas that form concentrated flow and these were used to delineate channel networks in the catchment du et al 2009 the delineated channel network density and extents were compared with stream networks from topographic maps to adjust threshold number of cells any cell with less upstream flow contributing cells than the threshold was considered as overland flow cell and others with more flow contributing upstream cells were classified as channel cells travel time computation techniques were then employed to determine travel time for each overland and channel flow cells based on available runoff in the cells and other hydraulic parameters cumulative travel times through each pathway computed from topographic data were used to route excess rainfall from each grid cell along flow paths to determine surface runoff hydrographs at the outlet of the catchment first kinematic wave theories suggested by wong 1995 2003 were used to derive travel time expressions for each grid cell depending on its classification i e overland flow cell or channel cell for an overland flow grid cell with negligible flow backwater effect the wave celerity c travelling down the grid cell was derived using kinematic wave equation given by eagleson 1970 4 c dx dt α β y β 1 where α and β are parameters used in q α y β to relate discharge per unit width q to flow depth y and x is distance along the direction of flow re writing eq 4 in terms of discharge per unit width q gives 5 c dx dt α 1 β β q 1 1 β for small period of time it can be assumed that overland grid cells receive constant and uniform excess rainfall intensity i and constant upstream inflow q u thus the unit discharge at the downstream end of the grid cell over that period can be calculated as 6 q q u ix assuming α is independent of x substituting eq 6 in eq 5 and solving the derivatives in eq 5 for t gives an expression for time of concentration for overland grid cells as 7 t c 1 α 1 β q u il 1 β q u 1 β i where t c the time of concentration and l is the length of the grid cell in the direction of flow in general overland flow concentration time for small grid cell areas such as used in this study are shorter than duration of excess rainfalls and eq 7 can thus be used to calculate travel time the time of concentration formula can be written as 8 t c li 1 β α 1 β λ 1 1 β λ 1 β where λ relates upstream inflow and influx from excess rainfall as follows 9 λ q u il values of friction parameters α and β can be obtained using manning s equation as α s n and β 5 3 respectively thus the expression for overland flow time of concentration from eq 8 can be written as 10 t c 7 nl s 0 5 0 6 i 0 4 λ 1 0 6 λ 0 6 where the units of parameters in eqs 9 and 10 above are given as minutes for t c m m for s m2 s for q u mm h for i and m for l manning s n values vary depending on the types of surface and can be selected from values recommended by engman 1986 the equivalent of eq 8 for channel flow grid cells with negligible backwater effect a constant upstream inflow and a uniform lateral inflow is given as 11 t tc l c α c q l β c 1 1 β c λ c 1 1 β c λ c 1 β c where t tc is time of concentration l c is the length of the channel cell in flow direction q l is the uniform lateral inflow α c and β c are parameters relating the discharge q in the channel to the flow area a and λ c relates the upstream inflow q u to the lateral inflow q l as follows 12 q α c a β c 13 λ c q u q l l c replacing α c s n and β c 5 3 friction parameter values determined from manning s equation and uniform lateral inflow q l il c in eq 11 above gives the channel flow time of concentration as 14 t tc 7 nl c s 0 5 0 6 il c 0 4 λ 1 0 6 λ 0 6 where the units of parameters in eqs 13 and 14 above are given as minutes for t tc m m for s m3 s for q u mm h for i and m for l c to account for uncertainties introduced during estimation of travel time calibration parameters k o and k c are included in eqs 15 and 16 as shown below to determine travel time in overland t c and channel flow t tc respectively 15 t c 7 k o nl s 0 5 0 6 i 0 4 λ 1 0 6 λ 0 6 16 t tc 7 k c nl c s 0 5 0 6 il c 0 4 λ 1 0 6 λ 0 6 the value of k o and k c parameters are determined by calibration finally travel times calculated for each grid cells using eqs 15 and 16 above are summed along flow paths at each model timestep to determine cumulative travel time of surface runoff from each grid cell to the catchment outlet 2 2 3 pollutant model the pollutant model estimates metaldehyde build up on high risk areas during dry days and wash off to water courses during surface runoff following rainfall events metaldehyde risk areas in the catchment have been identified based on available land use data which provides information on the likelihood of metaldehyde being applied to the land based on crop type during each growing season land growing winter crops such as winter wheat potatoes and oilseed rape where metaldehyde is commonly applied are identified as high risk areas data on land use derived from satellite imagery was acquired from the centre for ecology and hydrology for each growing season used in the analysis 2014 2017 fig 4 shows the identified high risk areas for the 2014 season metaldehyde application doses on these high risk areas and frequency of applications over pesticide application periods determine the accumulation of metaldehyde in the active zone at soil surfaces müller et al 2003 moreover the time interval between metaldehyde application and a rainfall event directly affects the amount of metaldehyde transported to water bodies through surface runoff these processes are represented using build up and wash off components in the model pollutant build up metaldehyde build up on high risk areas occur through application of pesticides that contain metaldehyde as an active ingredient wet conditions during winter provide an ideal environment for slugs to thrive and most metaldehyde applications are made during this period to protect winter crops typical single slug pellet application based on guidelines from manufacturers is 5 kg ha this is equivalent to 75 g hectare 0 19 g per 5 m2 grid size used in this study of metaldehyde based on a commonly used 1 5 slug pellet the statutory legal requirement in the uk on metaldehyde application states that total application in a calendar year should not exceed a maximum of 700 g ha routine monitoring data collected by the local water infrastructure operator shows that almost all high levels of metaldehyde in the river have occurred during the september to december application season fig 2 thus it can be assumed that most of the 700 g ha statuary annual legal limit of metaldehyde is applied during the september to december application period based on this assumption and the typical single metaldehyde application value of 75 g ha a total of not more than nine applications are expected during the winter crop growing season on any particular high risk farmland this combined with the relatively long half life of metaldehyde in soil suggest that metaldehyde presence on farmlands during this period is likely to be consistently high castle et al 2017 in this study it was initially assumed that metaldehyde was applied on all high risk areas 5 days before rainfall events which was later adjusted using a calibration parameter pollutant wash off metaldehyde wash off is dependent on a number of rainfall catchment and substance characteristics in this study pesticide loss equation based on the simplified formula for indirect loadings caused by runoff sfil berenzen et al 2005 reus et al 1999 is used to calculate percentage loss of metaldehyde at each timestep from high risk areas through runoff 17 l t q t p t fe t n ln 2 dt 50 soil 100 1 k d where l t percentage of application dose that

coefficient of active ingredient to organic carbon oc mass fraction of soil organic carbon content in percent runoff rate qt at each model timestep and total precipitation depth pt for each high risk cell are obtained from eqs 2 and 3 and from rainfall data the use of parameter koc in equation 17 above has some limitations as it generally refers to sorption coefficient of pesticides into soil organic matrix and doesn t take into account adsorptions to clay particles which is present in the study area however metaldehydes low koc value and solubility mean that this limitation is likely to have an insignificant impact on model outputs as peak metaldehyde concentrations are likely to be mainly due to metaldehyde transport in dissolved form the amount of metaldehyde available at soil surfaces during a rainfall event which is determined by applications and the number of days between applications and a rainfall event has significant impact on the overall wash off load that dissolves in surface runoff however lack of data on the specific timing of metaldehyde application makes this difficult to determine consequently build up and wash off rate parameters are difficult to be inferred from direct measurements in the catchment and are known to commonly introduce uncertainties in pollutant prediction models wijesiri et al 2016 to account for these uncertainties in the estimation of metaldehyde build up and wash off an additional parameter k which depends on initial metaldehyde concentrations c o in the river at the outlet of the catchment prior to rainfall events was used in the model the metaldehyde concentration trend in the river prior to a rainfall event provides a general indication of the level of metaldehyde application in the catchment during a particular pesticide application period ryberg and gilliom 2015 consequently it is therefore used in this study to adjust computations of metaldehyde load in surface runoff based on measured metaldehyde presence in the catchment hence metaldehyde load in surface runoff from each high risk cell at each timestep is determined by 18 m t kl t b where m t metaldehyde load in surface runoff at timestep t g k c o k b c o is metaldehyde concentration in the river prior to each rainfall event µg l k b is a calibration parameter l µg b metaldehyde build up on soil surface through applications taken as 0 19 g per 5 square meter based on typical application of 5 kg ha using 1 5 slug pellet 2 2 4 model integration for a given rainfall event over the catchment rate of surface runoff generation and travel times are computed using eqs 3 15 and 16 sections 2 2 1 and 2 2 2 at each model timestep the calculated travel time from each high risk cell is then used to route metaldehyde load to the outlet of the catchment time series of surface runoff and metaldehyde load in surface runoff can then be used to determine metaldehyde concentrations in runoff water arriving at the outlet of the catchment metaldehyde transport in ground water is not included in the modelling structure and thus a measured metaldehyde concentration in the river prior to a rainfall event is used to indicate base flow concentration metaldehyde concentrations in base flow co during the storm runoff period is assumed to be constant whereas a constant slope method is used to increase the amount of base flow qb over the runoff period blume et al 2007 these are then combined with time series of simulated concentrations in runoff and quantity of runoff water to determine total metaldehyde concentrations in the river accurate estimation of the arrival time of peak metaldehyde concentration at the abstraction site is important in terms of enabling smarter surface water abstraction management to avoid peak metaldehyde concentrations thus time to peak δt prediction error of peak flow δpf and concentration δpc are used to evaluate the model performance along with other commonly used criteria as shown in section 3 1 and 3 2 farmland in the study catchment that have high likelihood of metaldehyde being applied metaldehyde high risk areas are spread out in the catchment with some parts of the catchment containing more high risk areas than others the metaldehyde concentration at the catchment outlet over a specific time period is heavily dependent on the density of high risk areas within the relevant travel time isochrones fig 5 shows surface runoff travel time from 2015 high risk areas computed based on a constant and uniform rainfall intensity of 1 mm hr applied for 1 h over the whole catchment the sum of histograms in fig 5 is found to be 74 7 km2 which is in good agreement with the sum of the total high risk areas in the catchment 74 5 km2 high rates of runoff generation from high risk areas increases metaldehyde levels in the river whereas high rate of runoff generation from low risk areas have a dilution effect and can lower concentration of metaldehyde in the river thus metaldehyde concentration at the outlet of the catchment significantly depends on spatial variability of a rainfall event in relation to the distribution of high risk areas 2 3 model input calibration and verification data 2 3 1 land use soil type and dem land use soil type and dem of the catchment were pre processed to derive various spatial input datasets to the model direct model inputs derived from these data are land slope flow direction flow accumulation length of flow pathways manning s coefficients n curve numbers cn and high risk areas a vector layer of land use which was derived from satellite imagery was obtained from the centre for ecology and hydrology uk for each study year the land use map classifies crop types and grassland at field level and was used to assign metaldehyde high risk areas section 2 2 3 as well as manning s roughness coefficient n values for each grid cells based on values published in the literature montes 1998 brater and king 1976 manning s roughness values assigned for overland surfaces varied between 0 06 and 0 15 whereas roughness values assigned for channel surfaces based on the nature of the channels varied between 0 035 and 0 04 the spatially distributed manning s coefficient values and high risk areas were changed for each study year based on changes in land use in the catchment the soil map for the study catchment was obtained from the uk national soil resources institute nsri database nsri 2009 for the calculation of curve numbers see section 2 2 1 soils in the catchment were categorized into four hydrologic soil groups a d based on the soil s runoff generating potential usda 1986 hydrologic soil group a generally has the lowest runoff potential and group d has the highest potential hydrologic parameters for the calculation of runoff such as slope flow direction flow accumulation drainage basin and stream network delineation were derived in arcgis using os terrain 5 digital elevation model which was obtained from ordnance survey uk 2 3 2 rainfall radar rainfall data was acquired from the uk met office s nimrod system with spatial and temporal resolution of 1 km2 and 5 min respectively met office 2003 the radar rainfall data was resampled to a 5 m2 grid and aggregated to one hour resolution to match with the model grid and time resolution this was used as input data for the calculation of runoff generation and pollutant wash off see sections 2 2 1 and 2 2 3 initially four rainfall events in the catchment were selected to calibrate and validate the travel time based surface runoff model developed in this study summary statistics and temporally averaged spatial variation of each rainfall event are provided in table 1 and fig 6 below the temporal variations of each rainfall event are presented in fig 8 significant rainfall events with a range of rainfall intensity and durations were selected to represent rainfall conditions that are likely to cause metaldehyde spikes at the outlet of the catchment historical radar rainfall data was used to compute antecedent soil moisture conditions for each grid cell and this were used to adjust grid cell curve number values following the validation of the runoff model radar rainfall data observed during the four metaldehyde data collection events were used to drive the metaldehyde prediction model simulations summary statistics and temporally averaged spatial variation of each rainfall event used for calibration and validation of the metaldehyde prediction model are provided in table 2 and fig 7 below the temporal variations of each rainfall event are presented in fig 9 2 3 3 flow historical hourly flow data from a flow gauging station situated at the outlet of the catchment was obtained from the uk environment agency the flow hydrographs for each rainfall events were separated into base flow and direct runoff using straight line method reddy 2006 a straight line is drawn from the point where the sharp rise in hydrograph occurs to the end of recession limb which is used to separate the hydrograph into two distinct components a fast intermittent runoff response and a slow continuous base flow response of the catchment the fast response runoff hydrographs resulting from the selected rainfall events table 1 were used to calibrate and validate the surface runoff model 2 3 4 water sampling and metaldehyde data water samples were collected from river leam using auto samplers installed at surface water abstraction site used for drinking water supply the use of auto samplers enabled the continuous collection of hourly water samples during storm runoff events which successfully captured the short term fluctuations of metaldehyde concentrations at the abstraction site the auto samplers were manually triggered before the arrival of forecasted rainfall events which were judged likely to cause metaldehyde peaks due to surface runoff for each event sampling was carried out for a period of 3 5 days which enabled the acquisition of water samples during the full surface runoff period following the rainfall events the data collection campaign was carried out over a period of three metaldehyde application seasons between september 2014 and february 2017 collected water samples were analysed in laboratory to determine metaldehyde concentrations details on the metaldehyde detection method used are provided by li et al 2010 3 results and discussion this section presents the calibration and verification results of surface runoff and metaldehyde concentration prediction models for the rainfall events presented in tables 1 and 2 comparison of simulated model results with measured flow data at the catchment outlet and metaldehyde concentration data from four water quality sampling events are discussed using various error statistics 3 1 surface runoff model the performance of metaldehyde prediction model is dependent on surface runoff travel times from high risk areas to the outlet of the catchment thus the surface runoff model which consists of surface runoff generation and runoff routing components needs to be calibrated and validated before it is integrated to the pollutant build up wash off model flow data recorded by a gauging station located at the outlet of the catchment is acquired from environment agency and is used to calibrate and validate the travel time computation technique used in the surface runoff model runoff generation and transport from the entire catchment is considered for the calibration and verification of the surface runoff computation approach observed flow data from rainfall event a1 was used to calibrate parameters k o and k c eqs 15 and 16 used in the computation of travel times in over land and channel flow cells respectively simulation of the runoff prediction model was carried out using eleven different combinations of k o and k c values table 3 the performance of the surface runoff model was evaluated using the prediction error of peak flow rate δpf prediction error of time to peak δt and volume conservation index vci which was calculated using equation 19 in addition the overall model prediction efficiency over the entire hydrograph was evaluated using model efficiency coefficient e as shown in eq 20 19 vci t 1 t q m t t 1 t q o t 20 e 1 t 1 t q m t q o t 2 t 1 t q o t q o 2 where q m t is predicted flow at discrete times t m3 s q o t is observed flow at discrete times t m3 s and q o is mean of observed flow values over the entire period m3 s the runoff model prediction results and error statistics for rainfall event a1 which was used for model calibration are summarized in table 3 the volume conservation index vci for rainfall event a1 is found to be 0 87 the results indicated that k c 1 and k o 0 8 provide the optimum solution considering all the four evaluation criteria the calibrated parameter value of kc 1 shows that the manning s roughness coefficient values assigned to channels based on values from literature and other parameters used to compute channel travel time required no adjustment overall the calibration results showed that model performance in predicting surface runoff is more sensitive to the computation of channel travel time than overland travel time these calibrated parameter values were used to make surface runoff model simulations for the three remaining rainfall events table 4 summarizes the results of model simulation and error statistics for the three rainfall events used for surface runoff model validation it was observed that model simulations of all three rainfall events have efficiencies greater than 0 80 and prediction error of peak flow rate less than 10 in addition volume conservation index of more than 80 and time to peak error of less than 6 h have been observed for all rainfall events with an average efficiency of 0 87 for the rainfall events used for validation the overall performance of the calibrated travel time based surface runoff model can be considered reasonable the surface runoff model performed better for rainfall events with higher amc as compared to rainfall events with low amc comparison of observed and simulated surface runoff hydrographs for all four rainfall events are shown in fig 8 fig 8 also shows the spatially averaged rainfall over the catchment in general the levels of error statistics observed are practically acceptable and predicted surface runoff hydrographs agree well with the simulated hydrographs consequently the calibrated travel time approach can be used for estimation of metaldehyde transport from high risk areas in the catchment 3 2 metaldehyde prediction model the rainfall event based operation of the automatic samplers to collect hourly water samples enabled the capture of high resolution metaldehyde concentrations arriving at the outlet of the catchment following rainfall events results of the analysis of metaldehyde concentrations from the collected water quality samples for each event are presented in fig 9 the analysis shows that relatively short lived metaldehyde peaks with event durations ranging from 12 48 h occur following rainfall events fig 9 the size and nature of these short lived metaldehyde spikes are highly variable between events for example recorded metaldehyde concentrations rise by approximately 500 during event b2 but only by 150 during event b3 however averaged rainfall is of the same order of magnitude for both events the datasets therefore emphasise that runoff generation from high risk areas has a significant impact on metaldehyde concentrations in the catchment surface waters and that pollutant dynamics is highly sensitive to temporal and spatial distributions of rainfall and land use moreover soil type on the land where metaldehyde is applied combined with chemical characteristics of metaldehyde such as solubility and sorption coefficient play an important role in the process of mobilizing metaldehyde into water courses the metaldehyde concentration prediction model represents metaldehyde transport in surface runoff from high risk areas in the catchment by coupling the travel time technique calibrated in section 3 1 with build up wash off component this enabled forecasting of metaldehyde concentration levels following rainfall events at the outlet of the catchment where the surface water abstraction site is located metaldehyde concentration data collected over data collection event b1 was used to calibrate the value of parameter k b which was used to account for uncertainties associated with the estimation of metaldehyde build up and wash off rate different values of parameter k b ranging from 1 to 3 5 were set in the metaldehyde prediction model to simulate metaldehyde concentrations during data collection event b1 the model performance was evaluated using four criteria i e prediction error of time to peak concentration δtc prediction error of peak metaldehyde concentration δpc coefficient of determination r of observed and simulated metaldehyde concentrations and model prediction efficiency e however due to the assumption of uniform application of metaldehyde on all high risk areas section 2 2 3 changes in parameter kb result in an overall proportional increase or decrease of predicted metaldehyde concentrations across the prediction period hence calibration has no impact on the proportion of the variances between predicted and observed concentrations as a result coefficient of determination r values between predicted and observed concentrations are found to be insensitive to changes in parameter kb the metaldehyde prediction model results for data collection event b1 and associated error statistics are summarized in table 5 the results indicated that optimum solution is attained with k b 1 6 considering the remaining criteria for data collection event b1 an initial measured river concentration co value of 0 067 µg l is used for the calibration event b1 measured co values for each event used for metaldehyde model validation events are presented in table 6 3 2 1 verification metaldehyde model simulations were carried out for other three metaldehyde data collection events using calibrated parameter values table 6 summarizes model simulation results and error statistics for all three data collection events it was observed that simulations for all three events have correlation coefficients of 0 70 or more prediction error of peak metaldehyde concentration less than 5 and time to peak concentration error of 6 or less hours observed and predicted metaldehyde concentrations along with spatially averaged rainfall data are shown in fig 9 for all four data collection events in general metaldehyde concentrations are predicted well for all events with practically acceptable levels of errors in terms of both concentration levels and prediction of peak arrival times the results showed the capability of the model developed in this study for the intended practical purpose of predicting the arrival of peak metaldehyde concentrations and informing surface water abstractions discrepancies in the prediction of the peak arrival time are likely to be caused mainly by uncertainties associated with estimation of channel travel time antecedent conditions and the assumption of uniform metaldehyde application throughout the high risk areas in the catchment some of these errors may be reduced in future via the use of more calibration data and a more detailed consideration of metaldehyde applications informed by data from farmers i e real time application data 4 conclusions diffuse agricultural pollution is known to be a significant concern to the quality of surface water with implications for drinking water supply smarter management of water resources including forecasting and prediction of pollutant spikes is a possible means to avoid contamination of drinking water supplies and reduce the cost of water treatment this requires a detailed understanding of pollutant processes in the catchment in response to rainfall events the occurrence sources transport and fate of organic compounds in the environment involve a variety of processes that determine how the compounds are initially distributed move and react consequently assessing fate and transport of contaminants in the environment is a complex issue this study focuses on predicting the arrival of peak metaldehyde concentrations in surface runoff at abstraction sites with a view to inform surface water abstraction decisions hence a model has been developed to describe short term dynamics and transport primarily driven by rainfall driven runoff rather than longer term reactions degradation or groundwater processes runoff generation and routing is spatially and temporally variable and hence surface water quality responses are dependent on the spatial distribution of pesticide within the catchment a function of land use and the dynamics of individual rainfall events to date the quantification and understanding of the pollutant dynamics that drive short term fluctuations has been hindered by a paucity of high resolution water quality sampling data the physically based distributed metaldehyde prediction approach developed in this study combines surface runoff and build up wash off concepts in a gis environment enabling the full consideration of spatially and temporally variable rainfall and land use patterns model parameters and input data are extracted from radar rainfall data soil type land use and dems to address the paucity of current data we attempt to utilize automatic samplers which were triggered during rainfall events to capture the impact of forecasted rainfall events on the concentrations in surface waters the variation in the metaldehyde concentration response between the rainfall events demonstrates the importance of a full consideration of spatio temporal rainfall and metaldehyde application data in terms of practical application it is noted that the accurate forecasting of arrival time of peaks is of more value than forecasting of the peak concentration value as this enables surface water abstraction decision makings such as suspending abstractions temporarily in order to avoid the entrance of high metaldehyde levels into water supply systems given the inability of existing treatment techniques to remove high metaldehyde levels from water and the absence of direct metaldehyde detection methods the model developed in this study provides a cost effective and sustainable solution when applied to the trial catchment the model was able to predict peak concentrations to within 6 h in all tested cases given the availability of water storage infrastructure in the catchment this would enable the operator to suspend abstraction for this period to allow likely periods of high concentration to pass given the effective utilisation of storage such a suspension would not have a significant negative impact on water resources especially if abstraction was increased at other times to compensate the increasing availability of catchment scale spatial datasets combined with the relatively simple gis based application of the model makes it suitable for use in various catchments where prediction of metaldehyde exposures are required moreover in the presence of reliable spatially distributed datasets the developed approach can potentially be extended to predict exposures to other pollutants of interest at catchment scale as well as inform catchment management options future work will investigate the quantification of modelling input and parameter uncertainty on both predicted concentration levels and peak arrival times acknowledgements

7231,the feasibility of simulating the hydrological response of a grass swale to runoff inflows was examined using the hydrological model mike she and the available input data from 12 irrigation events mimicking runoff from block rainfalls the test swale channel had a trapezoidal cross section bottom slope of 1 5 length of 30 m and was built in loamy fine sand the irrigation events consisted in releasing two equal constant inflows to the swale a concentrated longitudinal flow at the upstream end and a distributed lateral inflow along the swale side slope adjacent to the contributing drainage area the total inflows approximated runoff from two events with return periods of 2 months and 3 years respectively for durations of 30 min irrigation experiments were done for two states of the initial soil moisture dry or wet antecedent moisture conditions amc mike she has been extensively used on catchments of various sizes but rarely for small stormwater management facilities and their detailed topography investigated in this study the latter application required high spatial and temporal resolutions with computational cells of 0 2 0 2 m and time steps as short as 0 6 s to avoid computational instabilities for dominant hydrological processes the following computational options in mike she were chosen soil infiltration the van genuchten equation unsaturated zone flow the one dimensional richards equation and overland flow the diffusive wave approximation of the st venant equations for study purposes the model was calibrated for single events representing one of four combinations of low and high inflows and dry and wet amc and then applied to the remaining 11 events this was complemented by calibration for two events representing high inflow on wet amc and low inflow in dry amc the goodness of fit was statistically assessed for observed and simulated peak flows hydrograph volumes nash sutcliffe model efficiencies nse and soil water content swc in swale soil layers the best fit nse 0 8 was obtained for high inflows and wet amc i e when the primary swale function is flow conveyance the least fit was noted for low inflows and dry amc when the primary swale function is flow attenuation furthermore this observation indicates the overall importance of correct modelling of the soil infiltration the effects of spatial variation of swc on the swale discharge hydrograph could not be confirmed from simulation results but high topographical accuracy was beneficial for reproducing well the locations of the observed water ponding no significant increases in simulated swc at 0 3 m or greater depths were noted which agreed with field observations overall the results indicated that mike she was effective in process oriented small scale modelling of grass swale flow hydrographs keywords grass swale distributed modelling mike she soil water content stormwater management 1 introduction the aging urban drainage infrastructure and anticipated upscaling of design rainfalls by climate change pose risks to urban populations and their environment in search for risk mitigation measures the decentralisation of stormwater drainage has been promoted together with practices helping restore natural hydrological functions of urban catchments such functions include storage infiltration and evapotranspiration of stormwater and can be substantially achieved by implementing urban green infrastructure gi however the incorporation of gi measures into urban drainage challenges stormwater management because of an increased heterogeneity of drainage processes and uncertain drainage capacities and operability e g dietz and clausen 2008 this observation may help explain why local authorities are often hesitant to incorporate gi and low impact development lid measures in urban drainage systems among the gi measures relatively simple infiltration and conveyance structures such as traditional grass drainage swales represent low cost low maintenance measures that can reduce the hydraulic and pollution loads to downstream drainage sections and receiving waters li et al 1998 zimmerman et al 2010 where space is available grass swales are widely used as replacements of the conventional curb and gutter drainage dietz 2007 ahiablame et al 2012 and serve to convey and attenuate stormwater runoff and improve its quality the reduction of peak flow rates and runoff volumes is mainly achieved by infiltration of stormwater into the soils of the swale channel and by extending the time of concentration which results in delayed discharges into downstream drainage facilities such benefits of swale operation vary with the rainstorm intensity during intermediate and severe rainstorms swales primarily act as runoff conveyance channels with minor flow reductions davis et al 2012 that vary depending on the antecedent moisture conditions amc and the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat of the swale soil pitt et al 2008 for implementing grass swales in the current drainage practice mathematical models of swale flows are needed for designing such facilities and assessing their vulnerabilities in a changing climate even though some existing urban runoff models can be and have been applied in swale design their applications may be subject to limitations arising from the fact that those models were principally built for other purposes elliott and trowsdale 2007 consequently other models dedicated to understanding swale operation also appeared in the literature deletic 2001 developed the 1 d physically based model trava for runoff and sediment transport in grass swales the model was further verified by deletic and fletcher 2006 and produced acceptably accurate predictions of swale outflows but less satisfactory predictions of transport of total suspended solids tss the conceptual model music was applied for low impact development lid planning and simulations of flow and tss transport in swales wong et al 2006 deletic and fletcher 2004 however more recent attempts by imteaz et al 2013 to reproduce experimental observations in swales with the music were unsuccessful raising the issue of general applicability of this model most recently garcía serrana et al 2017 published a swale calculator minnesota dry swale calculator developed to simulate infiltration and flows on the side slopes and in the swale channel for varying soil moisture contents besides the above research oriented models the feasibility of applying the leading hydrological modelling packages including hspf bicknell et al 1997 mike she dhi 2017 mike urban dhi 2016 and the swmm rossman 2010 to modelling swales has been also investigated helmers and eisenhauer 2006 applied uncalibrated mike she to analyse the effects of spatial variability of hydraulic properties of a vegetative filter on outflow hydrographs generated by irrigation experiments they used 26 samples of saturated hydraulic conductivity ranging from 0 36 to 13 30 cm h over an area of 13x15 m selected the model spatial resolution of 0 76 m and compared the results to simulations with spatially uniform hydraulic soil properties but found no significant differences they noted that the simulation of higher inflow rates produced better agreements for overland flow ol travel times to the outlets zölch et al 2017 applied mike she to analyse scenarios of gi implementation on the scale of an urban block 3 5 ha which was represented in 1 m spatial resolution ackerman and stein 2008 used the continuous simulation model hspf the hydrologic simulation program fortran to study the sensitivity of swale drainage to model parameters over a range of storms and concluded that the swale effectiveness in improving stormwater quality increased with increasing infiltration rates of the underlying soils flanagan et al 2017 used swmm to simulate the treatment performance of a road vegetative filter swale system over a period of several years they identified the saturated hydraulic conductivity of swale soils as the most sensitive model parameter whose correct estimation reduced uncertainties in modelling results niazi et al 2017 reviewed swmm performance concerning calibration and verification water quality simulations and gi lid design they concluded that the model is well suited for large and medium scale applications but may require coupling to other algorithms or models for simulating gi lid implementation scenarios at small scales a recent field study of the hydrology of grass swales focusing on generation of swale inflow and outflow hydrographs by irrigation and measurements of swale soil water content swc rujner et al 2018 offered an opportunity and data for examining the intricacies of applying mike she to simulation of flows in grass swale channels such a study is described herein and was undertaken with the following objectives i demonstrate whether swale inflow and outflow hydrographs and the associated swc changes observed in field irrigation experiments can be reproduced with the mike she model ii calibrate mike she for different calibration event characteristics and high temporal and spatial resolutions and iii identify the implications of mike she calibration verification simulations for model parameter selection and the predictive performance 2 methods 2 1 study site and field data 2 1 1 physical characteristics of the test site the study site was a 30 m grass swale section located in the residential suburb of the city of luleå northern sweden 65 35 03 n 22 09 17 e draining a two lane road the swale has a trapezoidal cross section with the bottom width varying from 0 2 to 0 7 m the channel depths from 0 6 to 0 8 m and relatively steep side slopes 1 2 to 1 2 5 topographical information was collected at 486 elevation points with a rtk gps device and served to estimate the bottom slope as 1 5 the test swale topography is displayed in fig 1 the swale design excludes special arrangement of soil layers or the use of soil amendments or an underdrain the soil horizons consisted of ca 0 1 m turf layer with organic material and loamy sandy soil of which soil texture varied noticeably within the test section average grain size distribution of the top layer soils clay 0 3 3 1 silt 6 6 32 4 and sand 60 8 93 1 a 0 1 0 5 m layer of homogeneous loamy sand and an underlying bed of sand and boulders followed double ring

irrigation twelve irrigation runs with inflows of 1 06 or 2 65 l s were performed to mimic runoff corresponding to that generated by block rainfalls with the return periods of 2 month and 3 years as estimated from the swedish national idf curves dahlström 2010 and the rational method two equal irrigation water inflows were introduced into the swale a concentrated longitudinal inflow at the upstream end and a laterally distributed inflow over 24 m through 220 openings of a labyrinth weir on the swale side slope opposite the roadway each irrigation event with a low variability of the flow rate see fig 2 lasted 0 5 h beside the inflow and outflow the swc were measured continuously at 15 points a five swc probes were located on the swale bottom inserted at a 45 angle up to a depth of 0 21 m b four probes on each irrigated and non irrigated side slopes inserted vertically and c the remaining two were buried horizontally at swale channel depths of 0 3 and 0 6 m approximately 1 5 m upstream of the outlet see fig 3 the experimental runs were initiated when the soil moisture reached a preselected state which was affected by the antecedent rain events or the earlier irrigation runs the ranges of the corresponding measured soil water contents swcav are summarized in table 1 for different locations in the swale as well as for two depths below the swale bottom in the subsequent description of the experimental and simulation conditions low soil moisture and high soil moisture are designated by symbols sm and sm respectively in each run measurements were recorded for a total duration of 1 5 h inflow and outflow hydrograph data were used to calculate swale channel water balance for individual events table 2 summarizes the following experimental data the inflow rate qin total inflow volume vin total outflow volume vout relative volume reduction δvrel vin vout vin relative peak flow reduction δqpk rel qin qout qin and the centroid lag time between the inflow and outflow hydrograph tlag flow depths were recorded manually using a yardstick at ten points along the swale centreline located 1 4 7 and 28 m downstream from the inflow point recordings were performed starting 5 min after the irrigation began and thereafter repeated in intervals of approximately 5 min 2 2 mike she mike she is a comprehensive hydrological model capable of simulating the main terrestrial water cycle and hydrological processes refsgaard and storm 1990 sahoo et al 2006 it was selected for this study because it couples the overland flow ol processes with the unsaturated zone uz flows by explicit simulation and generates high resolution time series including the soil water content as a raster based model its advantages include the capability to operate in various spatial and temporal scales and account for different spatial and temporal variabilities of the catchment characteristics with respect to the study objectives in our study the mike she version 2017 application focused on simulating two components of the swale water balance overland flow and infiltration into the uz but any feedback from the saturated zone sz was neglected the model was set up and calibrated using the parameter values initial conditions and input data from field measurements saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat initial soil water content swcini saturated water content θsat as well as qin qout and topography rujner et al 2018 and supplementing such information by model default and literature values 2 2 1 model set up and simulation settings mike she was set up to represent the studied grass swale and to simulate the overland flow and processes in the unsaturated zone the basic conceptual and computational settings of the model are listed in table 3 for both the ol and uz modules to calculate ol the diffusive wave approximation of the saint venant equations was used whereas the one dimensional richards equation richards 1931 was solved for soil water movement in the uz dhi 2017 while the actual computational time steps were typically as short as 0 6 s to satisfy the courant condition dhi 2017 the computed data were outputted in time intervals of 15 s matching the time resolution of field measurements the numerical solver type for ol was selected as an explicit scheme instead of the implicit iteration which in mike she generates more accurate results and is often used to calculate surface water flows during flooding beside numerical accuracy provided by the explicit ol solver adaptive time steps ensured numerical stability during high inflows over relatively steep side slopes at the expense of slightly increased computational times of simulations the model domain area covering the tested swale is 307 2 m2 with a grid cell size of 0 04 m2 which was considered reasonable with respect to the computational times required during the manual parameter estimation essential inputs for the mike she model set up can be arranged in the following categories hydro meteorological inputs rainfall here replaced by near surface irrigation inflow reference evapotranspiration land use vegetation the leaf area index lai root depth ol manning m equals the reciprocal value of manning n used hereafter detention storage uz soil profile definitions initial water content although the simulation period is short reference evapotranspiration was applied 2 5 mm day eriksson 1981 because the implementation of the richards equation in mike she requires the definition of a sink term standard values for lai and root depth were adopted for developed grass layers 2 2 1 1 inputs relevant for overland flow swale channel elevation points were used to generate a 0 1 0 1 m grid digital elevation model dem in arcgis a higher resolution for the topography than in the model domain was used to allow the application of the multi cell method in mike she dhi 2017 which mitigates the loss of topographic detail relevant to detention storage and ol manning n and detention storage were considered as calibration parameters subject to adjustments and were set spatially uniform in the whole modelling domain 2 2 1 2 accounting for near surface irrigation in the model the mike she model structure does not directly allow for a near surface irrigation or an external inflow into the domain in a specific location in order to reproduce the experimental inflow conditions in the model the irrigated grid cells were assigned the inflow rate time series which corresponded to their actual locations in the field fig 3 depicted as arrows furthermore the cells upstream of the inflow cells were assigned a negligible hydraulic conductivity practically preventing any infiltration with ksat as low as 1 10 20 m s this arrangement allowed for controlled inflow and in order to ensure that the directly introduced inflows into the cells were routed towards the swale bottom the model topography was modified upstream of the inflow points by means of steep slopes for each of the near surface irrigation events a spatial time series file was generated 12 files in total 2 2 1 3 initial soil water content the soil water content measured at 15 points was an important input to the model typically such measurements are considered valid for a 1 litre soil volume surrounding the sensor however to introduce some spatial variability of the initial swc into the model seven sub sections were defined five within the swale bottom and two on each of the irrigated and non irrigated side slopes fig 3 these subsections were then assigned the swcini values from the corresponding measurement probes initial swc for each simulation represented the conditions measured in the field 2 2 1 4 soil profile definitions soils were represented uniformly along the swale modelled except for the inflow areas and defined in layers with uniform properties those layers were further subdivided into computational layers a model cross section is presented in fig 4 showing the vertical discretization state variables that affect vertical flow processes were calculated by the van genuchten formula van genuchten 1980 for fitting the soil water retention curve in combination with the van genuchten mualem formula mualem 1976 for the relative hydraulic conductivity the measured average ksat was used for the first top soil layer the measured maximum swc was assumed to correspond to the saturated swc θsat and applied uniformly to the entire swale the residual water content θr adopted here from rawls et al 1982 as θr 0 035 for loamy sand was treated the same way the van genuchten parameters for the soil water retention curve nr αr and for the relative hydraulic conductivity nc αc and the shape factor were subject to calibration 2 3 calibration parameters overland flow and infiltration into the unsaturated zone are the dominant processes in grass swales and the corresponding model parameters had to be calibrated consequently manning n and depression storage were calibrated for overland flow and for the unsaturated zone the van genuchten and van genuchten mualem parameters were calibrated the model defaults or literature values were selected as starting values in the calibration process see table 4 the swale model comprised three major soil layers whose layer specific soil parameters could be adjusted soil parameters of the first layer were the most relevant calibration parameters whereas the parameters of the lowest soil layer could be safely ignored table 5 2 4 manual calibration procedure four of the twelve events monitored in field experiments were selected for discrete event model calibrations these four events were characterized by different inflow and soil moisture conditions low inflow rates q and low soil moisture sm event 11 08 1 sm low inflow rate and high soil moisture sm event 11 08 2 sm high inflow rate q and low soil moisture event 30 08 1 sm and high inflow rate and high soil moisture event 26 08 2 sm the reason for selecting these specific events was the fact that their initial swc values were close to the average initial swc of the sets of three runs targeting the same values of initial swc and inflows manual parameter calibration was conducted by changing one parameter at a time within the preselected individual intervals while keeping the other parameters constant and subsequently running the model visual comparisons of the outlet hydrographs qout obs and qout sim formed the basis for deciding whether to continue or stop this iterative process when assessing such an agreement the emphasis was placed on similarities of the rising limbs peak flows and the falling limb shapes after acceptable agreement was noted the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 was calculated and when it reached or exceeded the value of 0 95 the calibration process was stopped the manual calibration procedure followed a certain sequence for parameter adjustments to fit the simulated hydrograph fig 5 1 increasing αr1 and reducing nr1 to reach a reasonable hydraulic soil configuration 2 increasing αc1 reducing nc1 to achieve an increase in ol generation and after that the detention storage and manning n were adjusted to change the shape of the rising and falling limbs and the timing of the hydrograph the same procedure was applied to the second soil layer but with negligible effects on the simulated hydrographs the resulting final four parameter sets ps were denoted with ps q sm ps q sm ps q sm ps q sm 2 4 1 two event calibration in search for a parameter set that would deliver acceptable model performance for a range of events a further manual calibration was undertaken against a pair of swale outflows produced by one q sm event 11 08 1 and one q sm event 26 08 2 for this purpose the means of the previously derived parameter sets q sm and q sm were used as the initial values in the calibration process 2 5 evaluation of the predictive power of the calibrated model after the calibration of mike she for each of the four individual calibration events and the combination of two events was finalised the calibrated model was evaluated against the remaining eleven and ten events in the dataset respectively by comparing the measured and simulated vout qout and the average soil water content in the top 0 21 m layer of the uz 2 5 1 statistical evaluation to assess the performance of the individual calibration parameter sets common statistical measures were used as listed below where subscripts obs and sim referred to

for the swc was evaluated only by the rmse the calibrated parameter sets were analysed using the above criteria and the results for individual sets were mutually compared performance statistics were also applied to each inflow swcini condition in order to identify for which condition the calibration produced satisfactory results those combinations were grouped and plotted by the following categories 1 performance criteria nvr npfr nse and 2 the inflow swcini conditions q sm q sm q sm q sm 3 results the material presented in this section is divided into the following subsections i manual model calibration ii comparison of the observed and simulated swale discharge hydrographs iii predictive performance of the five calibration parameter sets and iv agreement between the observed and simulated soil water contents and flow depths 3 1 manual model calibration four single event calibrations and one two event calibration were performed to calibrate mike she against the outflow hydrographs of swale irrigation events which resulted in five individual calibrated parameter sets with the main calibration parameters limited to two independent parameters of the van genuchten soil water retention curve of the two top soil layers αr and nr two independent parameters of the van genuchten mualem formula for the relative hydraulic conductivity of the two top soil layers αc and nc and manning n and depression storage values for single event calibrations an initial fitting of the vg retention curve by αr1 nr1 was done to achieve a reasonable field capacity subsequently αc1 nc1 had to be adjusted to reduce the relative hydraulic conductivity to allow early excess flow and ol as the initial parameter setting allowed complete abstraction of inflow after that manning n was increased to delay the outflow hydrograph and adjustments of the detention storage further increased the flow retardation and the flattening of the individual hydrograph limbs in general the parameters were adjusted in a way that the soil permeability was reduced in all ps for sm and sm αc1 had to be increased from 0 007 to at least 0 089 and nc1 reduced from 3 85 to 1 28 it was noted that primarily nc and secondarily αc had a strong influence on the magnitude of the resulting flow rate and manning n and detention storage exerted a strong influence on the timing and duration of simulated discharges for q manning n had to be increased in order to delay outflow and to produce the typical plateau of the hydrographs visible in the measured data depression storage had to be increased significantly for low initial swc in order to achieve meaningful results the calibration process indicated that the soil parameters of the second soil layer located at 0 3 to 0 55 m below the ground surface αr2 nr2 αc2 nr2 shape factor had negligible influence on the resulting hydrograph shape 3 2 comparison of the observed and simulated swale outflow hydrographs the final calibrated parameter sets for each of the four single event calibrations and the two event calibration were used to simulate the remaining eleven or ten evaluation events respectively the observed and simulated hydrographs of the calibration events are displayed in fig 6 and indicate an excellent agreement as also confirmed by high nse values see table 6 the adjustments of calibration parameters allowed for an accurate alignment of the rising limbs and the hydrograph peak minor deviations occurred in the case of falling limbs and short duration disturbances of measured flows observed in fig 6d the plot of simulated hydrographs of the evaluation events fig 7 indicates variations in the goodness of fit of the simulated to observed hydrographs with main deviations in the simulated flow volumes and hydrograph lag times it can be observed that the ps derived for low soil moisture underestimated the outflow from evaluation events with high soil moisture and vice versa thus the effects of changes in the initial swc as measured in the experiments especially for events with low initial swc were not reproduced well such deviations were partially mitigated in the case of higher inflow rates as seen in fig 7d peak flows were reproduced fairly well for various inflow conditions but this may be partly caused by the shape of hydrographs produced by block rainfall as seen in fig 8 the two event calibration achieved relative high agreements between observations and simulations 3 3 predictive performance of the calibration parameter sets the calibration procedure indicated that the soil parameters that influence the hydraulic conductivity were critical parameters for generating surface runoff the quantitative assessment of the performance criteria including the volumetric residual and nse for the calibration events as well as for all the evaluation events is summarized in table 6 in general the smallest differences between the simulated and observed values and the lowest rmses were found for ps q sm and ps q sm the rmses between these two ps as well as between ps q sm and ps q sm show similar patterns indicating a weak predictive performance for q and sm events generally the model predictive efficiency is lower for ps derived for low initial soil moisture compared to those for high initial soil moisture the worst model performance was noted for ps q sm and q sm events and for ps q sm and ps q sm for the 03 09 1 event however lower relative deviations from observations occurred with high flow rates fig 9 shows box plots of the normalized peak flow residuals normalized volumetric residual as well as rmse and nse for each of the five ps applied to the evaluation events for all ps peak flows were reproduced with minor residuals while there was a large spread of the volumetric residuals with an indication that ps q sm and ps q sm parameter sets based on calibrations for low initial soil moisture tended to underestimate volumes and ps q sm and ps q sm overestimated volumes as also seen in the hydrograph plots event 03 09 1 with low initial soil moisture conditions below the average was the source of outliers in the data sets concerning the box plot means ps q sm and ps q sm achieved slightly better results than the rest the smallest residuals and the best model predictive performance were noted for the ps q sm indicating that the model calibrated against that specific event is most robust independently of any specific parameter set fig 10 a c summarizes the performance of the model in reproducing various inflow conditions it shows that independent of the parameter sets specific setting predictions are the worst for low inflow rates q and low initial soil moisture sm 3 4 agreement between the observed and simulated soil water contents and flow depths soil water content measurements at the study site in the top 0 21 m soil layer of the swale bottom indicated only minor water movement rujner et al 2018 which agrees well with the simulation results for the uz while in the first computational layer 0 0 0 05 m the maximum saturation was reached quickly below 0 125 m no significant increase in the water content occurred within the 1 5 h simulation period however the measured swc representing a 0 21 m soil layer showed immediate and large changes which only applied to swc changes in the modelled uz for the first two computational layers see fig 11 thus to achieve an agreement between the field measurements and simulated values the depth weighted average swc of the computational layers 1 8 which is equivalent to 0 0 20 m of soil depth was calculated compared to the observed values and the rmse was calculated the different parameter sets also affect uz water movement after the inflow stopped while the swc for ps q sm ps q sm and ps q sm remained stagnant the swc for the ps q sm kept increasing table 7 lists the rmse values between the simulated and measured swc at five probe locations obs1 5 the greatest residuals were found for simulations with low initial soil moisture the smallest for high initial soil moisture ps q sm simulates swc with the least residuals when focusing just on the uz layer averages the deviation of the simulated swc from the measured one can be partly explained by the assumption of a single maximum swc for the entire swale model whereas in the field the maximum observed swc values varied among probes the simulated overland flow depth in the swale centreline in general does not agree well with the values measured in the field fig 12 shows an example of such data from five locations for event 11 08 1 and ps q sm respectively 4 discussion as given by the nature of swale irrigation experimental data mike she was tested with respect to simulating the filling of soil storage and flow routing in a grass swale channel for block type inflow hydrographs the swale outflow was reproduced by the single event calibrated model applied with high spatial and temporal resolutions mostly with high agreement between the observed and simulated hydrographs nse 0 8 in general better agreement was achieved in runs with wet antecedent conditions and high inflow rates but none of the applied calibration parameter sets produced satisfactory swale outflows for dry antecedent conditions indicating limited model sensitivity to changes in swale swc because of the relatively high hydraulic loading of the swale the role of the unsaturated zone was of minor importance and limited to controlling the supply of infiltration saturation excess to the overland flow after the swale inflow started relatively fast soil saturation and the attainment of ks infiltration rates was well reproduced in model simulations with some storage in the upper uz a systematic manual calibration of mike she was favoured over the automatic calibration built into the model autocal for such reasons as a relatively simple grass swale structure limited volumes of hydrologic data and calibration parameters and the opportunity of achieving a better understanding of results by following the manual calibration process furthermore the calibration efforts focussed mainly on the parameters controlling the initial runoff infiltration parameters of the retention curve and relative hydraulic conductivity of the top soil layer and the hydraulic roughness flow velocity of the overland flow described by manning n and depression storage most of the calibration effort was spent on finding satisfactory agreements of the rising and falling hydrograph limbs of the observed and simulated hydrographs the capture of spatial heterogeneity in modelling is typically limited by the density of field measurements and further simplifications in the model will lead to a loss of information beven 2012 helmers and eisenhauer 2006 noted significant effects of topographical discretization on simulated discharges from a vegetative filter and recommended to use a detailed spatial representation of the filter the simulation results presented herein with cell size 0 2 0 2 m followed that recommendation with good results manifested by good reproduction of the locations of ponding in the swale the vertical resolution of the soil profile into three soil layers was less relevant when dealing with high inflows but served as a useful reference for soil moisture measurements the timing of the swale hydrograph was primarily affected by manning n and depression storage in the initial testing the effects of spatially variable n were negligible and consequently constant values of n and depression storage were adopted in calibrations the calibrated values of n depended on inflow rates and the initial wetness and were in the range of 0 11 0 26 which was comparable to that reported by deletic and fletcher 2006 helmers and eisenhauer 2006 and rossman 2009 data for grass swales and filter strips 0 05 0 24 the calibrated depression storage values depended on the initial wetness with somewhat elevated values obtained for dry initial conditions 3 1 10 mm and very low values obtained for wet initial conditions null null 5 mm while the former values are comparable to those reported e g by krebs et al 2014 and palla and gnecco 2015 3 1 5 mm the latter values are rather low low depression storage was in agreement with the observed early generation of runoff in the swale the applied multi cell method considered a higher resolution of the topography 0 1 0 1 m instead of 0 2 0 2 m to adjust overland flow among cells and account for channel bottom irregularities and flow attenuation by water ponding which would have been ignored in the coarser grid the initial soil water content varied both horizontally in seven subsections and vertically in three depths uniform ksat and θsat together with the distributed initial swc resulted in soil saturation in swale sections after various inflow durations and was followed by various durations of water ponding however these sequences had no influence on the generation of swale outflow the model was barely sensitive to spatial variations of swc with respect to peak flows and flow volumes which resulted in higher volumetric residuals for events with low initial swc when examining the average nse of evaluation events the parameter sets adjusted for wet conditions yielded slightly higher values than those for dry conditions supporting the notion that hydraulic processes prevail at this stage and that calibration simulation for soils with higher hydraulic conductivities or initial dryness is more challenging therefore in this study the unsaturated zone more or less served as a storage layer attenuating the incoming runoff the above discussion implies that in mike she simulations the routing of known quantities of inflow is well reproducible but the underlying calibration process produced just a minor gain in advancing the understanding of the roles of the antecedent soil moisture and unsaturated zone in water retention and redistribution and the discharge hydrograph mike she performed well in coupling main hydrological processes in high temporal and spatial resolutions however to take full advantage of this distributed model in examining the swale hydrology multi event testing with actual rainfall of varying intensities is recommended furthermore accurate swc data and flow depth measurements could be considered in calibration which might improve the representation of such processes as ol and uz flow therefore the study presented herein can be considered as an initial step for simulating small scale lids with a process oriented approach 5 conclusions the feasibility of using mike she for simulating the hydrological response of a grass swale to irrigation inflows was tested on a set of data from 12 swale irrigation experiments within the limitations of the specific data set used and the small size of the tested runoff catchment the following conclusions may be drawn simulations with mike she confirm that a grass swale exposed to significant inflows functions mainly as a conveyance channel with small attenuation of flow volumes and peaks the model reproduced the outlet hydrographs with good agreements nse 0 8 between the observed and simulated hydrographs relatively high inflows to the swale revealed minor importance of the unsaturated zone in swale flow formation as shown by generation of overland flows by reducing infiltration with relative hydraulic conductivity and soil retention curve parameters four calibrations against single events and one for two events indicated that the soil parameters influencing the swc dependent hydraulic conductivity were the critical parameters for generation of surface runoff model calibrations for events with low amc reduced the predictive efficiency of the model for other events with higher amc and calibrations against the events with high amc resulted in a better agreement between the observed and simulated swale hydrographs the highest nash sutcliffe model efficiencies were found for the calibration parameter sets reflecting high inflow and amc values modelling detailed swale topography was helpful for predicting locations of water ponding along the swale bottom the model output was little sensitive to spatial variations of the soil water content which resulted in larger residuals in simulated runoff peak flows and volumes especially for dry amc this suggests that simulations for soils with higher hydraulic conductivities or very low initial soil moistures are more challenging the study findings for modelling grass swale flows indicate a good potential of distributed hydrological models like mike she to be applied in process oriented simulations of swales and similar small scale lids

7231,the feasibility of simulating the hydrological response of a grass swale to runoff inflows was examined using the hydrological model mike she and the available input data from 12 irrigation events mimicking runoff from block rainfalls the test swale channel had a trapezoidal cross section bottom slope of 1 5 length of 30 m and was built in loamy fine sand the irrigation events consisted in releasing two equal constant inflows to the swale a concentrated longitudinal flow at the upstream end and a distributed lateral inflow along the swale side slope adjacent to the contributing drainage area the total inflows approximated runoff from two events with return periods of 2 months and 3 years respectively for durations of 30 min irrigation experiments were done for two states of the initial soil moisture dry or wet antecedent moisture conditions amc mike she has been extensively used on catchments of various sizes but rarely for small stormwater management facilities and their detailed topography investigated in this study the latter application required high spatial and temporal resolutions with computational cells of 0 2 0 2 m and time steps as short as 0 6 s to avoid computational instabilities for dominant hydrological processes the following computational options in mike she were chosen soil infiltration the van genuchten equation unsaturated zone flow the one dimensional richards equation and overland flow the diffusive wave approximation of the st venant equations for study purposes the model was calibrated for single events representing one of four combinations of low and high inflows and dry and wet amc and then applied to the remaining 11 events this was complemented by calibration for two events representing high inflow on wet amc and low inflow in dry amc the goodness of fit was statistically assessed for observed and simulated peak flows hydrograph volumes nash sutcliffe model efficiencies nse and soil water content swc in swale soil layers the best fit nse 0 8 was obtained for high inflows and wet amc i e when the primary swale function is flow conveyance the least fit was noted for low inflows and dry amc when the primary swale function is flow attenuation furthermore this observation indicates the overall importance of correct modelling of the soil infiltration the effects of spatial variation of swc on the swale discharge hydrograph could not be confirmed from simulation results but high topographical accuracy was beneficial for reproducing well the locations of the observed water ponding no significant increases in simulated swc at 0 3 m or greater depths were noted which agreed with field observations overall the results indicated that mike she was effective in process oriented small scale modelling of grass swale flow hydrographs keywords grass swale distributed modelling mike she soil water content stormwater management 1 introduction the aging urban drainage infrastructure and anticipated upscaling of design rainfalls by climate change pose risks to urban populations and their environment in search for risk mitigation measures the decentralisation of stormwater drainage has been promoted together with practices helping restore natural hydrological functions of urban catchments such functions include storage infiltration and evapotranspiration of stormwater and can be substantially achieved by implementing urban green infrastructure gi however the incorporation of gi measures into urban drainage challenges stormwater management because of an increased heterogeneity of drainage processes and uncertain drainage capacities and operability e g dietz and clausen 2008 this observation may help explain why local authorities are often hesitant to incorporate gi and low impact development lid measures in urban drainage systems among the gi measures relatively simple infiltration and conveyance structures such as traditional grass drainage swales represent low cost low maintenance measures that can reduce the hydraulic and pollution loads to downstream drainage sections and receiving waters li et al 1998 zimmerman et al 2010 where space is available grass swales are widely used as replacements of the conventional curb and gutter drainage dietz 2007 ahiablame et al 2012 and serve to convey and attenuate stormwater runoff and improve its quality the reduction of peak flow rates and runoff volumes is mainly achieved by infiltration of stormwater into the soils of the swale channel and by extending the time of concentration which results in delayed discharges into downstream drainage facilities such benefits of swale operation vary with the rainstorm intensity during intermediate and severe rainstorms swales primarily act as runoff conveyance channels with minor flow reductions davis et al 2012 that vary depending on the antecedent moisture conditions amc and the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat of the swale soil pitt et al 2008 for implementing grass swales in the current drainage practice mathematical models of swale flows are needed for designing such facilities and assessing their vulnerabilities in a changing climate even though some existing urban runoff models can be and have been applied in swale design their applications may be subject to limitations arising from the fact that those models were principally built for other purposes elliott and trowsdale 2007 consequently other models dedicated to understanding swale operation also appeared in the literature deletic 2001 developed the 1 d physically based model trava for runoff and sediment transport in grass swales the model was further verified by deletic and fletcher 2006 and produced acceptably accurate predictions of swale outflows but less satisfactory predictions of transport of total suspended solids tss the conceptual model music was applied for low impact development lid planning and simulations of flow and tss transport in swales wong et al 2006 deletic and fletcher 2004 however more recent attempts by imteaz et al 2013 to reproduce experimental observations in swales with the music were unsuccessful raising the issue of general applicability of this model most recently garcía serrana et al 2017 published a swale calculator minnesota dry swale calculator developed to simulate infiltration and flows on the side slopes and in the swale channel for varying soil moisture contents besides the above research oriented models the feasibility of applying the leading hydrological modelling packages including hspf bicknell et al 1997 mike she dhi 2017 mike urban dhi 2016 and the swmm rossman 2010 to modelling swales has been also investigated helmers and eisenhauer 2006 applied uncalibrated mike she to analyse the effects of spatial variability of hydraulic properties of a vegetative filter on outflow hydrographs generated by irrigation experiments they used 26 samples of saturated hydraulic conductivity ranging from 0 36 to 13 30 cm h over an area of 13x15 m selected the model spatial resolution of 0 76 m and compared the results to simulations with spatially uniform hydraulic soil properties but found no significant differences they noted that the simulation of higher inflow rates produced better agreements for overland flow ol travel times to the outlets zölch et al 2017 applied mike she to analyse scenarios of gi implementation on the scale of an urban block 3 5 ha which was represented in 1 m spatial resolution ackerman and stein 2008 used the continuous simulation model hspf the hydrologic simulation program fortran to study the sensitivity of swale drainage to model parameters over a range of storms and concluded that the swale effectiveness in improving stormwater quality increased with increasing infiltration rates of the underlying soils flanagan et al 2017 used swmm to simulate the treatment performance of a road vegetative filter swale system over a period of several years they identified the saturated hydraulic conductivity of swale soils as the most sensitive model parameter whose correct estimation reduced uncertainties in modelling results niazi et al 2017 reviewed swmm performance concerning calibration and verification water quality simulations and gi lid design they concluded that the model is well suited for large and medium scale applications but may require coupling to other algorithms or models for simulating gi lid implementation scenarios at small scales a recent field study of the hydrology of grass swales focusing on generation of swale inflow and outflow hydrographs by irrigation and measurements of swale soil water content swc rujner et al 2018 offered an opportunity and data for examining the intricacies of applying mike she to simulation of flows in grass swale channels such a study is described herein and was undertaken with the following objectives i demonstrate whether swale inflow and outflow hydrographs and the associated swc changes observed in field irrigation experiments can be reproduced with the mike she model ii calibrate mike she for different calibration event characteristics and high temporal and spatial resolutions and iii identify the implications of mike she calibration verification simulations for model parameter selection and the predictive performance 2 methods 2 1 study site and field data 2 1 1 physical characteristics of the test site the study site was a 30 m grass swale section located in the residential suburb of the city of luleå northern sweden 65 35 03 n 22 09 17 e draining a two lane road the swale has a trapezoidal cross section with the bottom width varying from 0 2 to 0 7 m the channel depths from 0 6 to 0 8 m and relatively steep side slopes 1 2 to 1 2 5 topographical information was collected at 486 elevation points with a rtk gps device and served to estimate the bottom slope as 1 5 the test swale topography is displayed in fig 1 the swale design excludes special arrangement of soil layers or the use of soil amendments or an underdrain the soil horizons consisted of ca 0 1 m turf layer with organic material and loamy sandy soil of which soil texture varied noticeably within the test section average grain size distribution of the top layer soils clay 0 3 3 1 silt 6 6 32 4 and sand 60 8 93 1 a 0 1 0 5 m layer of homogeneous loamy sand and an underlying bed of sand and boulders followed double ring infiltrometer dri measurements at nine locations in the test section produced an average saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat 9 4 cm hr st dev 4 2 cm hr 2 1 2 stormwater runoff simulation by irrigation twelve irrigation runs with inflows of 1 06 or 2 65 l s were performed to mimic runoff corresponding to that generated by block rainfalls with the return periods of 2 month and 3 years as estimated from the swedish national idf curves dahlström 2010 and the rational method two equal irrigation water inflows were introduced into the swale a concentrated longitudinal inflow at the upstream end and a laterally distributed inflow over 24 m through 220 openings of a labyrinth weir on the swale side slope opposite the roadway each irrigation event with a low variability of the flow rate see fig 2 lasted 0 5 h beside the inflow and outflow the swc were measured continuously at 15 points a five swc probes were located on the swale bottom inserted at a 45 angle up to a depth of 0 21 m b four probes on each irrigated and non irrigated side slopes inserted vertically and c the remaining two were buried horizontally at swale channel depths of 0 3 and 0 6 m approximately 1 5 m upstream of the outlet see fig 3 the experimental runs were initiated when the soil moisture reached a preselected state which was affected by the antecedent rain events or the earlier irrigation runs the ranges of the corresponding measured soil water contents swcav are summarized in table 1 for different locations in the swale as well as for two depths below the swale bottom in the subsequent description of the experimental and simulation conditions low soil moisture and high soil moisture are designated by symbols sm and sm respectively in each run measurements were recorded for a total duration of 1 5 h inflow and outflow hydrograph data were used to calculate swale channel water balance for individual events table 2 summarizes the following experimental data the inflow rate qin total inflow volume vin total outflow volume vout relative volume reduction δvrel vin vout vin relative peak flow reduction δqpk rel qin qout qin and the centroid lag time between the inflow and outflow hydrograph tlag flow depths were recorded manually using a yardstick at ten points along the swale centreline located 1 4 7 and 28 m downstream from the inflow point recordings were performed starting 5 min after the irrigation began and thereafter repeated in intervals of approximately 5 min 2 2 mike she mike she is a comprehensive hydrological model capable of simulating the main terrestrial water cycle and hydrological processes refsgaard and storm 1990 sahoo et al 2006 it was selected for this study because it couples the overland flow ol processes with the unsaturated zone uz flows by explicit simulation and generates high resolution time series including the soil water content as a raster based model its advantages include the capability to operate in various spatial and temporal scales and account for different spatial and temporal variabilities of the catchment characteristics with respect to the study objectives in our study the mike she version 2017 application focused on simulating two components of the swale water balance overland flow and infiltration into the uz but any feedback from the saturated zone sz was neglected the model was set up and calibrated using the parameter values initial conditions and input data from field measurements saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat initial soil water content swcini saturated water content θsat as well as qin qout and topography rujner et al 2018 and supplementing such information by model default and literature values 2 2 1 model set up and simulation settings mike she was set up to represent the studied grass swale and to simulate the overland flow and processes in the unsaturated zone the basic conceptual and computational settings of the model are listed in table 3 for both the ol and uz modules to calculate ol the diffusive wave approximation of the saint venant equations was used whereas the one dimensional richards equation richards 1931 was solved for soil water movement in the uz dhi 2017 while the actual computational time steps were typically as short as 0 6 s to satisfy the courant condition dhi 2017 the computed data were outputted in time intervals of 15 s matching the time resolution of field measurements the numerical solver type for ol was selected as an explicit scheme instead of the implicit iteration which in mike she generates more accurate results and is often used to calculate surface water flows during flooding beside numerical accuracy provided by the explicit ol solver adaptive time steps ensured numerical stability during high inflows over relatively steep side slopes at the expense of slightly increased computational times of simulations the model domain area covering the tested swale is 307 2 m2 with a grid cell size of 0 04 m2 which was considered reasonable with respect to the computational times required during the manual parameter estimation essential inputs for the mike she model set up can be arranged in the following categories hydro meteorological inputs rainfall here replaced by near surface irrigation inflow reference evapotranspiration land use vegetation the leaf area index lai root depth ol manning m equals the reciprocal value of manning n used hereafter detention storage uz soil profile definitions initial water content although the simulation period is short reference evapotranspiration was applied 2 5 mm day eriksson 1981 because the implementation of the richards equation in mike she requires the definition of a sink term standard values for lai and root depth were adopted for developed grass layers 2 2 1 1 inputs relevant for overland flow swale channel elevation points were used to generate a 0 1 0 1 m grid digital elevation model dem in arcgis a higher resolution for the topography than in the model domain was used to allow the application of the multi cell method in mike she dhi 2017 which mitigates the loss of topographic detail relevant to detention storage and ol manning n and detention storage were considered as calibration parameters subject to adjustments and were set spatially uniform in the whole modelling domain 2 2 1 2 accounting for near surface irrigation in the model the mike she model structure does not directly allow for a near surface irrigation or an external inflow into the domain in a specific location in order to reproduce the experimental inflow conditions in the model the irrigated grid cells were assigned the inflow rate time series which corresponded to their actual locations in the field fig 3 depicted as arrows furthermore the cells upstream of the inflow cells were assigned a negligible hydraulic conductivity practically preventing any infiltration with ksat as low as 1 10 20 m s this arrangement allowed for controlled inflow and in order to ensure that the directly introduced inflows into the cells were routed towards the swale bottom the model topography was modified upstream of the inflow points by means of steep slopes for each of the near surface irrigation events a spatial time series file was generated 12 files in total 2 2 1 3 initial soil water content the soil water content measured at 15 points was an important input to the model typically such measurements are considered valid for a 1 litre soil volume surrounding the sensor however to introduce some spatial variability of the initial swc into the model seven sub sections were defined five within the swale bottom and two on each of the irrigated and non irrigated side slopes fig 3 these subsections were then assigned the swcini values from the corresponding measurement probes initial swc for each simulation represented the conditions measured in the field 2 2 1 4 soil profile definitions soils were represented uniformly along the swale modelled except for the inflow areas and defined in layers with uniform properties those layers were further subdivided into computational layers a model cross section is presented in fig 4 showing the vertical discretization state variables that affect vertical flow processes were calculated by the van genuchten formula van genuchten 1980 for fitting the soil water retention curve in combination with the van genuchten mualem formula mualem 1976 for the relative hydraulic conductivity the measured average ksat was used for the first top soil layer the measured maximum swc was assumed to correspond to the saturated swc θsat and applied uniformly to the entire swale the residual water content θr adopted here from rawls et al 1982 as θr 0 035 for loamy sand was treated the same way the van genuchten parameters for the soil water retention curve nr αr and for the relative hydraulic conductivity nc αc and the shape factor were subject to calibration 2 3 calibration parameters overland flow and infiltration into the unsaturated zone are the dominant processes in grass swales and the corresponding model parameters had to be calibrated consequently manning n and depression storage were calibrated for overland flow and for the unsaturated zone the van genuchten and van genuchten mualem parameters were calibrated the model defaults or literature values were selected as starting values in the calibration process see table 4 the swale model comprised three major soil layers whose layer specific soil parameters could be adjusted soil parameters of the first layer were the most relevant calibration parameters whereas the parameters of the lowest soil layer could be safely ignored table 5 2 4 manual calibration procedure four of the twelve events monitored in field experiments were selected for discrete event model calibrations these four events were characterized by different inflow and soil moisture conditions low inflow rates q and low soil moisture sm event 11 08 1 sm low inflow rate and high soil moisture sm event 11 08 2 sm high inflow rate q and low soil moisture event 30 08 1 sm and high inflow rate and high soil moisture event 26 08 2 sm the reason for selecting these specific events was the fact that their initial swc values were close to the average initial swc of the sets of three runs targeting the same values of initial swc and inflows manual parameter calibration was conducted by changing one parameter at a time within the preselected individual intervals while keeping the other parameters constant and subsequently running the model visual comparisons of the outlet hydrographs qout obs and qout sim formed the basis for deciding whether to continue or stop this iterative process when assessing such an agreement the emphasis was placed on similarities of the rising limbs peak flows and the falling limb shapes after acceptable agreement was noted the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 was calculated and when it reached or exceeded the value of 0 95 the calibration process was stopped the manual calibration procedure followed a certain sequence for parameter adjustments to fit the simulated hydrograph fig 5 1 increasing αr1 and reducing nr1 to reach a reasonable hydraulic soil configuration 2 increasing αc1 reducing nc1 to achieve an increase in ol generation and after that the detention storage and manning n were adjusted to change the shape of the rising and falling limbs and the timing of the hydrograph the same procedure was applied to the second soil layer but with negligible effects on the simulated hydrographs the resulting final four parameter sets ps were denoted with ps q sm ps q sm ps q sm ps q sm 2 4 1 two event calibration in search for a parameter set that would deliver acceptable model performance for a range of events a further manual calibration was undertaken against a pair of swale outflows produced by one q sm event 11 08 1 and one q sm event 26 08 2 for this purpose the means of the previously derived parameter sets q sm and q sm were used as the initial values in the calibration process 2 5 evaluation of the predictive power of the calibrated model after the calibration of mike she for each of the four individual calibration events and the combination of two events was finalised the calibrated model was evaluated against the remaining eleven and ten events in the dataset respectively by comparing the measured and simulated vout qout and the average soil water content in the top 0 21 m layer of the uz

manual model calibration ii comparison of the observed and simulated swale discharge hydrographs iii predictive performance of the five calibration parameter sets and iv agreement between the observed and simulated soil water contents and flow depths 3 1 manual model calibration four single event calibrations and one two event calibration were performed to calibrate mike she against the outflow hydrographs of swale irrigation events which resulted in five individual calibrated parameter sets with the main calibration parameters limited to two independent parameters of the van genuchten soil water retention curve of the two top soil layers αr and nr two independent parameters of the van genuchten mualem formula for the relative hydraulic conductivity of the two top soil layers αc and nc and manning n and depression storage values for single event calibrations an initial fitting of the vg retention curve by αr1 nr1 was done to achieve a reasonable field capacity subsequently αc1 nc1 had to be adjusted to reduce the relative hydraulic conductivity to allow early excess flow and ol as the initial parameter setting allowed complete abstraction of inflow after that manning n was increased to delay the outflow hydrograph and adjustments of the detention storage further increased the flow retardation and the flattening of the individual hydrograph limbs in general the parameters were adjusted in a way that the soil permeability was reduced in all ps for sm and sm αc1 had to be increased from 0 007 to at least 0 089 and nc1 reduced from 3 85 to 1 28 it was noted that primarily nc and secondarily αc had a strong influence on the magnitude of the resulting flow rate and manning n and detention storage exerted a strong influence on the timing and duration of simulated discharges for q manning n had to be increased in order to delay outflow and to produce the typical plateau of the hydrographs visible in the measured data depression storage had to be increased significantly for low initial swc in order to achieve meaningful results the calibration process indicated that the soil parameters of the second soil layer located at 0 3 to 0 55 m below the ground surface αr2 nr2 αc2 nr2 shape factor had negligible influence on the resulting hydrograph shape 3 2 comparison of the observed and simulated swale outflow hydrographs the final calibrated parameter sets for each of the four single event calibrations and the two event calibration were used to simulate the remaining eleven or ten evaluation events respectively the observed and simulated hydrographs of the calibration events are displayed in fig 6 and indicate an excellent agreement as also confirmed by high nse values see table 6 the adjustments of calibration parameters allowed for an accurate alignment of the rising limbs and the hydrograph peak minor deviations occurred in the case of falling limbs and short duration disturbances of measured flows observed in fig 6d the plot of simulated hydrographs of the evaluation events fig 7 indicates variations in the goodness of fit of the simulated to observed hydrographs with main deviations in the simulated flow volumes and hydrograph lag times it can be observed that the ps derived for low soil moisture underestimated the outflow from evaluation events with high soil moisture and vice versa thus the effects of changes in the initial swc as measured in the experiments especially for events with low initial swc were not reproduced well such deviations were partially mitigated in the case of higher inflow rates as seen in fig 7d peak flows were reproduced fairly well for various inflow conditions but this may be partly caused by the shape of hydrographs produced by block rainfall as seen in fig 8 the two event calibration achieved relative high agreements between observations and simulations 3 3 predictive performance of the calibration parameter sets the calibration procedure indicated that the soil parameters that influence the hydraulic conductivity were critical parameters for generating surface runoff the quantitative assessment of the performance criteria including the volumetric residual and nse for the calibration events as well as for all the evaluation events is summarized in table 6 in general the smallest differences between the simulated and observed values and the lowest rmses were found for ps q sm and ps q sm the rmses between these two ps as well as between ps q sm and ps q sm show similar patterns indicating a weak predictive performance for q and sm events generally the model predictive efficiency is lower for ps derived for low initial soil moisture compared to those for high initial soil moisture the worst model performance was noted for ps q sm and q sm events and for ps q sm and ps q sm for the 03 09 1 event however lower relative deviations from observations occurred with high flow rates fig 9 shows box plots of the normalized peak flow residuals normalized volumetric residual as well as rmse and nse for each of the five ps applied to the evaluation events for all ps peak flows were reproduced with minor residuals while there was a large spread of the volumetric residuals with an indication that ps q sm and ps q sm parameter sets based on calibrations for low initial soil moisture tended to underestimate volumes and ps q sm and ps q sm overestimated volumes as also seen in the hydrograph plots event 03 09 1 with low initial soil moisture conditions below the average was the source of outliers in the data sets concerning the box plot means ps q sm and ps q sm achieved slightly better results than the rest the smallest residuals and the best model predictive performance were noted for the ps q sm indicating that the model calibrated against that specific event is most robust independently of any specific parameter set fig 10 a c summarizes the performance of the model in reproducing various inflow conditions it shows that independent of the parameter sets specific setting predictions are the worst for low inflow rates q and low initial soil moisture sm 3 4 agreement between the observed and simulated soil water contents and flow depths soil water content measurements at the study site in the top 0 21 m soil layer of the swale bottom indicated only minor water movement rujner et al 2018 which agrees well with the simulation results for the uz while in the first computational layer 0 0 0 05 m the maximum saturation was reached quickly below 0 125 m no significant increase in the water content occurred within the 1 5 h simulation period however the measured swc representing a 0 21 m soil layer showed immediate and large changes which only applied to swc changes in the modelled uz for the first two computational layers see fig 11 thus to achieve an agreement between the field measurements and simulated values the depth weighted average swc of the computational layers 1 8 which is equivalent to 0 0 20 m of soil depth was calculated compared to the observed values and the rmse was calculated the different parameter sets also affect uz water movement after the inflow stopped while the swc for ps q sm ps q sm and ps q sm remained stagnant the swc for the ps q sm kept increasing table 7 lists the rmse values between the simulated and measured swc at five probe locations obs1 5 the greatest residuals were found for simulations with low initial soil moisture the smallest for high initial soil moisture ps q sm simulates swc with the least residuals when focusing just on the uz layer averages the deviation of the simulated swc from the measured one can be partly explained by the assumption of a single maximum swc for the entire swale model whereas in the field the maximum observed swc values varied among probes the simulated overland flow depth in the swale centreline in general does not agree well with the values measured in the field fig 12 shows an example of such data from five locations for event 11 08 1 and ps q sm respectively 4 discussion as given by the nature of swale irrigation experimental data mike she was tested with respect to simulating the filling of soil storage and flow routing in a grass swale channel for block type inflow hydrographs the swale outflow was reproduced by the single event calibrated model applied with high spatial and temporal resolutions mostly with high agreement between the observed and simulated hydrographs nse 0 8 in general better agreement was achieved in runs with wet antecedent conditions and high inflow rates but none of the applied calibration parameter sets produced satisfactory swale outflows for dry antecedent conditions indicating limited model sensitivity to changes in swale swc because of the relatively high hydraulic loading of the swale the role of the unsaturated zone was of minor importance and limited to controlling the supply of infiltration saturation excess to the overland flow after the swale inflow started relatively fast soil saturation and the attainment of ks infiltration rates was well reproduced in model simulations with some storage in the upper uz a systematic manual calibration of mike she was favoured over the automatic calibration built into the model autocal for such reasons as a relatively simple grass swale structure limited volumes of hydrologic data and calibration parameters and the opportunity of achieving a better understanding of results by following the manual calibration process furthermore the calibration efforts focussed mainly on the parameters controlling the initial runoff infiltration parameters of the retention curve and relative hydraulic conductivity of the top soil layer and the hydraulic roughness flow velocity of the overland flow described by manning n and depression storage most of the calibration effort was spent on finding satisfactory agreements of the rising and falling hydrograph limbs of the observed and simulated hydrographs the capture of spatial heterogeneity in modelling is typically limited by the density of field measurements and further simplifications in the model will lead to a loss of information beven 2012 helmers and eisenhauer 2006 noted significant effects of topographical discretization on simulated discharges from a vegetative filter and recommended to use a detailed spatial representation of the filter the simulation results presented herein with cell size 0 2 0 2 m followed that recommendation with good results manifested by good reproduction of the locations of ponding in the swale the vertical resolution of the soil profile into three soil layers was less relevant when dealing with high inflows but served as a useful reference for soil moisture measurements the timing of the swale hydrograph was primarily affected by manning n and depression storage in the initial testing the effects of spatially variable n were negligible and consequently constant values of n and depression storage were adopted in calibrations the calibrated values of n depended on inflow rates and the initial wetness and were in the range of 0 11 0 26 which was comparable to that reported by deletic and fletcher 2006 helmers and eisenhauer 2006 and rossman 2009 data for grass swales and filter strips 0 05 0 24 the calibrated depression storage values depended on the initial wetness with somewhat elevated values obtained for dry initial conditions 3 1 10 mm and very low values obtained for wet initial conditions null null 5 mm while the former values are comparable to those reported e g by krebs et al 2014 and palla and gnecco 2015 3 1 5 mm the latter values are rather low low depression storage was in agreement with the observed early generation of runoff in the swale the applied multi cell method considered a higher resolution of the topography 0 1 0 1 m instead of 0 2 0 2 m to adjust overland flow among cells and account for channel bottom irregularities and flow attenuation by water ponding which would have been ignored in the coarser grid the initial soil water content varied both horizontally in seven subsections and vertically in three depths uniform ksat and θsat together with the distributed initial swc resulted in soil saturation in swale sections after various inflow durations and was followed by various durations of water ponding however these sequences had no influence on the generation of swale outflow the model was barely sensitive to spatial variations of swc with respect to peak flows and flow volumes which resulted in higher volumetric residuals for events with low initial swc when examining the average nse of evaluation events the parameter sets adjusted for wet conditions yielded slightly higher values than those for dry conditions supporting the notion that hydraulic processes prevail at this stage and that calibration simulation for soils with higher hydraulic conductivities or initial dryness is more challenging therefore in this study the unsaturated zone more or less served as a storage layer attenuating the incoming runoff the above discussion implies that in mike she simulations the routing of known quantities of inflow is well reproducible but the underlying calibration process produced just a minor gain in advancing the understanding of the roles of the antecedent soil moisture and unsaturated zone in water retention and redistribution and the discharge hydrograph mike she performed well in coupling main hydrological processes in high temporal and spatial resolutions however to take full advantage of this distributed model in examining the swale hydrology multi event testing with actual rainfall of varying intensities is recommended furthermore accurate swc data and flow depth measurements could be considered in calibration which might improve the representation of such processes as ol and uz flow therefore the study presented herein can be considered as an initial step for simulating small scale lids with a process oriented approach 5 conclusions the feasibility of using mike she for simulating the hydrological response of a grass swale to irrigation inflows was tested on a set of data from 12 swale irrigation experiments within the limitations of the specific data set used and the small size of the tested runoff catchment the following conclusions may be drawn simulations with mike she confirm that a grass swale exposed to significant inflows functions mainly as a conveyance channel with small attenuation of flow volumes and peaks the model reproduced the outlet hydrographs with good agreements nse 0 8 between the observed and simulated hydrographs relatively high inflows to the swale revealed minor importance of the unsaturated zone in swale flow formation as shown by generation of overland flows by reducing infiltration with relative hydraulic conductivity and soil retention curve parameters four calibrations against single events and one for two events indicated that the soil parameters influencing the swc dependent hydraulic conductivity were the critical parameters for generation of surface runoff model calibrations for events with low amc reduced the predictive efficiency of the model for other events with higher amc and calibrations against the events with high amc resulted in a better agreement between the observed and simulated swale hydrographs the highest nash sutcliffe model efficiencies were found for the calibration parameter sets reflecting high inflow and amc values modelling detailed swale topography was helpful for predicting locations of water ponding along the swale bottom the model output was little sensitive to spatial variations of the soil water content which resulted in larger residuals in simulated runoff peak flows and volumes especially for dry amc this suggests that simulations for soils with higher hydraulic conductivities or very low initial soil moistures are more challenging the study findings for modelling grass swale flows indicate a good potential of distributed hydrological models like mike she to be applied in process oriented simulations of swales and similar small scale lids

7232,lake tissø is the fourth largest lake in denmark with sufficient continuous surface water input making lake bank filtration an optimal surface water extraction method provided that there are suitable shallow aquifers with a good hydraulic connection to the lake the shallow subsurface under the lake was mapped by five waterborne electrical resistivity tomography ert and eight ground penetrating radar gpr surveys to locate potentially suitable aquifers distributed temperature sensing dts was used for the general characterisation of the hydraulic connection between the lake and aquifer the waterborne ert surveys showed several zones of coarser material along the shore extending up to five meters depth below the lake surface while on land ert surveys confirmed that these zones extend to the lakeshore with similar thickness both waterborne ert and gpr profiles agreed that at a selected field site the highest possibility of coarse sediments is 60 140 m from the lakeshore lakebed temperatures measured in december 2016 may and june 2017 all indicated potential groundwater discharge to the lake at approximately 135 m from the shoreline supporting the results of geophysical surveys showing coarser sediments in that area a 2d numerical flow model of the area with a geological setup based on geophysical information and slugtest data also showed upward groundwater discharge peaks at 60 and 140 m from the shoreline confirming the findings of the field surveys thus this study shows that the combination of waterborne ert and gpr surveys with dts measurements is a fast and efficient way to assess the feasibility of lake bank filtration in these settings this approach of combined hydrogeophysical methods is robust and has a potential to site lake bank filtration areas not only next to large rivers where coarse sediments are found in abundance but even in different sedimentary environments where suitable layers for lake bank filtration are more difficult to identify keywords waterborne hydrogeophysics distributed temperature sensing lake bank filtration 1 introduction the growing population of the world necessitates a more conscious water management with emphasis on both the quality and quantity of water supplies bank filtration is an increasingly used method to meet the demands for both drinking water and industrial process water ray 2008 ghodeif et al 2016 pholkern et al 2015 during bank filtration the surface water is extracted through a pumping well located adjacent to the surface water body schubert 2002 thus the extracted water undergoes physical chemical and biological filtering while flowing from the surface water body through the aquifer to the pumping well hiscock and grischek 2002 holzbecher 2006 this natural filtration and potential attenuation of pollutants may considerably reduce water treatment costs compared to other extraction methods on the other hand water quality in bank filtration wells can be periodically vulnerable due to sudden changes in the hydraulic conditions such as flooding with shorter travel times of surface water to the pumping well wett et al 2002 water extraction by bank filtration is only sustainable if the surface water supplies are replenished continuously and thus most extraction sites are bordering large rivers or in some cases also lakes massmann et al 2008 furthermore it is also required that the surface water bodies are in good hydraulic connection to shallow aquifers geophysical measurements are traditionally used to map structures of subsurface materials also under surface water bodies electrical resistivity measurements survey the resistivity distribution of the subsurface which in turn is related to hydrological properties such as porosity water content and pore fluid conductivity these surveys can be carried out in a waterborne setup where the electrodes can be directly fixed to the bottom of the surface water body towed behind a boat at the bottom or arranged as a streamer cable floating at the water surface loke and lane 2004 these surveys have been used to map sediment properties under surface water bodies loke and lane 2004 crook et al 2008 finding fault zones under rivers kwon et al 2005 and underwater geological controls krantz et al 2004 or to study the geological evolution of sediment sequences colombero et al 2014 ground penetrating radar gpr measurements use high frequency electromagnetic signals to find differences in dielectric properties of the subsurface and thus locate boundaries these measurements are also used over open water to detect sedimentary changes or to estimate bathymetry and water volumes conant et al 2004 lin et al 2009 sambuelli and bava 2012 kidmose et al 2011 in a similar manner these waterborne geophysical methods can be used to detect coarser material zones beneath surface water bodies to optimize the placing of bank filtration wells groundwater discharge to surface water bodies indicates a natural good hydraulic connection to the underlying aquifer traditionally groundwater discharge is mapped and quantified by point scale measurements frequently by seepage meters rosenberry et al 2010 kidmose et al 2011 and vertical sediment temperature profiles schmidt et al 2007 jensen and engesgaard 2011 or in streams on a larger scale by differential gauging briggs et al 2012 poulsen et al 2015 recently distributed temperature sensing dts has been increasingly used to detect groundwater discharge over larger areas at the bottom of surface waters lowry et al 2007 krause et al 2012 sebok et al 2013 or to study infiltration rates at managed aquifer recharge sites vogt et al 2010 becker et al 2013 mawer et al 2016 the dts method relies on the natural difference between the relatively stable groundwater temperature and the seasonally variable surface water temperature where discharging groundwater will influence the temperature distribution at the sediment water interface swi the slight alteration in the swi temperature distribution can be detected by a fibre optic sensor cable deployed at the swi and thus indirectly infer the spatial distribution of groundwater discharge to surface water bodies as of yet dts has mostly been used in shallow surface waters and most frequently in stream environments the deployments of briggs et al 2012 in a stream occasionally deeper than 1 4 m slater et al 2010 in a river with water depths ranging between 2 and 18 m and selker et al 2006 in lake geneva comprise the deepest reported deployments still dts studies in lakes blume et al 2013 sebok et al 2013 are less common due to generally much smaller and slower currents in lakes compared to streams sediment temperatures at the lakebed are more sensitive to physical processes e g solar radiation neilson et al 2010 sebok et al 2013 thermal stratification wilhelm and adrian 2008 wind and wave action churchill and kerfoot 2007 than temperatures at the bed of streams therefore temperatures at the lakebed are influenced by many other processes and conditions in addition to thermal influences due to discharging groundwater so far waterborne geophysical measurements and dts were rarely applied simultaneously even though studies show that they can successfully complement each other when studying groundwater discharge in complex river aquifer systems slater et al 2010 near shore marine environments henderson et al 2010 or when studying infiltration rates at a managed aquifer recharge site mawer et al 2016 the combination of these methods has the potential to be used to select sites for bank filtration around lakes where coarse sediments are not found in such thick layers and in a similar abundance as along large rivers lake tissø is the fourth largest lake in denmark with a constant supply of stream water due to the rising demands for industrial process water the local waterworks kalundborg forsyning a s intends to double the present direct extraction of 5 million m3 year surface water from the lake lake bank filtration could be an optimal extraction method of surface water from the lake potentially reducing water treatment costs provided that there are suitable shallow aquifers along the lakeshore through which lake water can be extracted the overall aim of the study was therefore to assess the feasibility of lake bank filtration at the lake by mapping shallow aquifers under and around the lake and characterizing the present hydraulic connection between these aquifers and the lake the specific objectives of the study were to 1 assess the capability of waterborne ert and gpr measurements to detect shallow aquifers under the lake 2 assess distributed temperature sensing as a tool to map the distribution of groundwater discharge to the lake in greater water depths and seasonally varying lake stage conditions and 3 to test if the combination of these methods can be used in the future to site bank filtration wells 2 material and methods 2 1 field site lake tissø located on the island of sjælland in eastern denmark fig 1 a has a surface area of 12 3 km2 and a topographical catchment of 432 km2 with a surface elevation of 77 m above sea level masl in the east to 1 masl in the west fig 1b groundwater flow in the catchment is generally towards the sea located 5 km to the west from the lake outlet the upper sediments in the area are characterised by quaternary moraine clay sand and gravel layers which are underlain by palaeocene marine clay or chalk the lake is fed mainly by halleby stream running to the lake in the northeast and having an outlet in the southwest fig 1b the average annual discharge of halleby stream just upstream of the outlet to the lake was 2 21 m3 s in the period of 2007 2013 the lake is a natura 2000 protected area and well known for its rich bird population which is one of the reasons that the lake stage is regulated by a weir placed at the outlet of halleby stream to avoid low lake stages during the summer period the annual lake stage varied between 0 84 and 2 61 masl with an average of 1 45 masl in 2007 2017 the lake has a maximum depth of 13 m but nearshore margins are shallow such that water depths 100 m from the shoreline are commonly less than 1 m the local waterworks kalundborg forsyning a s is currently extracting 5 million m3 yr surface water at the western side of the lake fig 1c to use as industrial process water sonnenborg et al 2012 evaluated the impact of climate change on the hydrology of the lake and found the abstraction of water from the lake sustainable even under changing climate conditions but seawater intrusion to the lake may have negative impacts on the lake water quality in the future 2 2 electrical resistivity tomography both on land and waterborne electrical resistivity tomography ert was used to map the properties of saturated sediments under the lakebed and around the lakeshore all together data from five waterborne ert lines were collected fig 1c d three lines along the lakeshore extending in lengths of respectively 2570 1980 and 460 m were surveyed in september and december 2016 depending on the water depth approximately 20 40 m offshore based on the results of these surveys further waterborne ert data was collected at two transects of 187 and 191 m length perpendicular to the shore at the eastern side of the lake in december 2016 fig 1d simultaneously to the resistivity measurements a gps and a sounder were used to measure the location and water depth the water depth along the survey lines along the lakeshore varied between 0 4 and 1 51 m and the resistivity of the lake water was measured to be 22 and 16 5 ωm in september and december respectively corresponding to an electrical conductivity of 498 and 606 μs cm respectively while the electrical conductivity of the shallow groundwater around the lake varied between 690 and 2400 μs cm as measured in the piezometers between september 2016 and july 2017 the water depth and resistivity data were later used to constrain the inversion the ert measurements were carried out using a streamer cable towed behind a boat comprising two transmitter electrodes emitting current pulses of 250 ms length every 2 s and 11 electrodes measuring the resulting potential field the electrodes were spaced 5 m apart with the transmitter electrodes placed in the middle of the cable lakebed resistivity data was collected using a wenner schlumberger layout floats mounted at the electrodes kept the cable floating and towing kept the cable stretched on the lake surface loke and lane 2004 found that the presence of the water layer reduced the penetration depth of the ert survey with floating electrodes by an amount at least equal to the water depth however this method was chosen due to the ease and speed of data acquisition and the presence of seaweed which did not allow the dragging of the cable at the lakebed the penetration depth of the waterborne ert surveys was between 9 and 12 m below the lake surface three on land ert surveys ert i ert ii and ert iii using the wenner layout were carried out fig 1c d data from the transect parallel to the lakeshore ert i was collected in october 2016 with 3 m electrode spacing in a total length of 285 m and an approximate penetration depth of 50 m two transects perpendicular to the shore were measured in february 2017 ert ii was measured with a 2 m electrode spacing in a total length of 190 m and an approximate penetration depth of 30 m while ert iii using an electrode spacing of 5 m in a total length of 475 m had an approximate penetration depth of 60 m both for the on land and waterborne surveys resistivity data was collected using the syscal pro resistivity meter iris instruments orleans france with the sysmar system for the waterborne surveys the inversion was carried out by res2dinv geotomo software using the least squares inversion technique a transect of piezometers was established perpendicular to the shore parallel to ert line ii fig 1d to compare resistivity data to sediment properties inferred from slugtests the 12 piezometers were screened at various depths between 1 5 and 7 m below ground level and were water levelled each month from february 2017 depending on their hydraulic properties up to three slugtests were carried out using the falling head method in 10 piezometers table 1 in the remaining two piezometers t7 and t9 it was not possible to carry out slugtests due to the deformation of piezometer pipes during the installation process in two piezometers b83 and b84 slugtests were carried out at multiple screen depths from 1 to 7 m below the ground level slug test data was analysed using the hvorslev method for unconfined aquifers hvorslev 1951 the hydraulic conductivities were compared to resistivity data from the ert surveys and used to assign horizontal hydraulic conductivity to the sediment layers of the numerical model 2 3 ground penetrating radar to obtain higher resolution information about the subsurface sediments and their depositional structures a waterborne gpr survey was performed in august 2016 using a malå proex system malå geoscience sweden with a 100 mhz shielded antenna towed in an inflatable rubber boat eight transects of the lakebed were surveyed at the eastern lakeshore perpendicular to the shoreline fig 1c in a length of 220 320 m depending on the water depth with a few hundred meters spacing between the transects a sampling frequency of 1000 mhz trace length of 200 ns and a sampling interval of 5 cm were used for the surveys gps data was collected simultaneously data processing was carried out using the reflexw software sandmeier geophysical research germany depending on the sediment properties the penetration depth of the measurements was up to 3 m below the lake bottom 2 4 distributed temperature sensing at the test site on the eastern lakeshore fig 1d lakebed sediment temperature distributions were mapped with dts since the temperature of the discharging groundwater is different and relatively stable compared to surface water temperatures potential groundwater discharge sites can be delineated based on sediment temperature anomalies assuming that discharging groundwater to the lake is indicative of a natural good hydraulic connection to the underlying shallow aquifer the lakebed temperature measurements were used to compare with sediment properties deduced from the waterborne geophysical measurements a brusteel fibre optic cable was deployed at the bottom of the lake in a looped layout fig 1d and attached to a sensornet oryx sr unit lakebed sediment temperature measurements were collected in a dual ended mode each 30 min with 10 min integration time and a measurement spacing of 1 m data were collected during three periods of several days length on 16 19 december 2016 and 12 16 may and 19 22 june 2017 with a precision of 0 04 0 06 and 0 05 c respectively the daily average temperature of the lake water was 3 6 12 2 and 20 3 c during the surveys in december may and june respectively with a stable groundwater temperature of around 9 c thus in december warmer lakebed temperature and in may and june colder lakebed temperature could indicate groundwater discharge to the lake during a gps survey the position of the looped fibre optic cable at the lakebed was georeferenced and detailed information about the depth of the cable below the lake surface fig 1d was collected the survey was carried out on 30 march 2017 when the lake stage was 1 58 m above sea level the highest during the survey while the depth of the fibre optic cable ranged from 0 95 to 4 34 m below the lake water surface fig 1d temperature data from a transect running 0 to 200 m offshore fig 1d was analysed and compared to data from the underwater sediment properties inferred from the waterborne ert and gpr data since the lake is of varying depth and wave action and thermal layering could also influence the temperature observed at the swi the temperature data measured at each location was compared to the average of the swi temperatures measured at 5 10 m distance offshore from the measurement location thus temperature data from each measurement location was compared to the surrounding offshore area instead of an areal average such as done traditionally where colder or warmer areas qualitatively indicated potential groundwater discharge lowry et al 2007 krause et al 2012 sebok et al 2013 in this study measurement locations were considered potential groundwater discharge locations if their measured temperature was colder warmer depending on the season by 0 15 c than the average temperatures surrounding it by 5 10 m distance in the offshore direction the 0 15 c is an arbitrary threshold which was selected by taking the precision of the measurements into account this way the gradual warming winter or cooling summer of the lake water due to increasing water depth and distance from the shore was excluded from the analysis this approach might mean that some potential groundwater discharge locations were not captured but the ones captured in the analysis are not dependent on water depth nor the influence of air temperature 2 5 numerical modelling the compact sediments and water depths above 1 5 m made the installation of temperature probes and seepage meters impossible at the lake bottom further offshore thus numerical modelling was used to integrate and confirm the findings of the hydrogeophysical surveys and the potential discharge zones indicated by the dts measurements at the selected test site a 2d steady state numerical model was set up in modflow harbaugh 2005 the modelled area extended from the middle of the lake to beyond the eastern part of the lake fig 1c where a large unsaturated zone was detected by the ert iii survey the model grid had a cell discretization of 5 0 2 2 m in the x y and z direction the spatial distribution of the materials in the model domain was assigned based on the on land resistivity surveys from ert transects ii and iii and the offshore ert survey d where available fig 1d the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of materials was based on the average horizontal hydraulic conductivity calculated from the slugtests in the piezometers screened in the specific materials see section 3 2 the bottom of the model domain was defined at 50 masl as a no flow boundary as data from neighbouring boreholes indicated a thick eocene marine clay layer at approximately that depth the area of the lake was assigned as a specified head boundary while the eastern model boundary was also a specified head boundary with a hydraulic head given as the lower limit of the unsaturated zone inferred from the ert iii survey a uniform recharge rate of 120 mm yr was applied to the on land model area sonnenborg et al 2012 due to the low topographical gradient of the land area in vicinity of the lake the area is relatively wet thus drains with a conductance of 0 2 1 d in a depth of 0 1 m below the land surface were set in the first 100 m of the near shore area on land as field data from the slugtests was used to assign the hydraulic conductivity of different materials in the model domain see section 3 2 for details on the distribution and properties of these materials the anisotropy of the different materials was manually calibrated against the hydraulic heads measured in the piezometers on 18 april 2017 in the initial model an anisotropy ratio of 10 was assumed for the horizontal to the vertical hydraulic conductivity to approximate the unknown anisotropy ratio for each material the flow model was tested with an anisotropy ratio of 1 50 and 100 head observations from 18 april 2017 were chosen for the calibration as this dataset was approximating best the mean head in the piezometer network during the study period furthermore due to the strongly artesian conditions this was the first dataset where ice in the piezometer pipes did not disturb any of the head measurements and simultaneous head data could be obtained from the piezometer network the lake stage of 1 41 masl as measured on 18 april 2017 was set as a specified head boundary at the area of the lake in order to compare the spatial distribution of the upwelling to the hydrogeophysical surveys the flow entering through the lower cell face in the lake cells 0 210 m from the shore was used to calculate the magnitude and spatial distribution of upwelling 3 results 3 1 large scale geophysical surveys as the lake water resistivity was fairly uniform around the lake it was assumed that resistivity changes in the individual ert profiles reflected changes in the resistivity of saturated sediments under the lake thus indicating changes in material properties with coarser materials potential shallow aquifers showing higher resistivity values at the same time temperature can influence the measured electrical resistivity of sediments by inducing a 1 8 2 2 percent change in bulk electrical conductivity per degree c hayley et al 2007 thus absolute resistivity values obtained from measurements at different seasons may not be directly comparable the root mean square error rmse of the waterborne profiles varied between 1 6 and 5 3 and for the land survey were 1 7 and 1 9 the waterborne ert surveys along the shoreline all showed resistivities from 10 to 150 ωm with a penetration depth of 9 12 m below the lake surface the resistivities measured in the waterborne ert surveys generally corresponded to moraine clay and sand sediments in denmark ahrentzen et al 1987 in all survey lines along the shore relatively higher resistivities coarser materials were observed as discrete zones of up to a few hundred meters in horizontal extent fig 2 resistivity values higher than 40 ωm generally occurred in the upper five meters below the lake surface marked with a red line on fig 2 and were more frequent in the northern and western part of the lake fig 2a sediments five meters below the water surface and deeper showed uniform low resistivities of less than 20 ωm lakebed sediments with the highest resistivities could be found at the eastern shore fig 2c but similarly to the other surveyed areas fig 2a b this zone with higher resistivities did not extend more than five meters below the lake surface the eight gpr transects located perpendicular to the shoreline all clearly showed the elevation of the sediment surface and had a shallow maximum three meter penetration depth below the lakebed in all transects the attenuation of the electromagnetic signal was strong most likely due to sediments with elevated clay content thus only a few underwater sediment structures could be observed due to this strong signal attenuation it was also assumed that the observed sediment structures represented coarser material generally coarser sediments with structures sloping towards the lake could be observed up to approximately 2 m depth below the lakebed fig 3 both at the northern and eastern side of the lake these structures did not appear at the close proximity of the lakeshore but were most pronounced 100 170 m from the shore fig 3 as all gpr transects showed approximately similar results the waterborne ert surveys were used to select a site for detailed field investigations since the zone with the highest resistivity was located at the eastern lakeshore the area was studied with additional smaller scale waterborne and on land ert measurements dts measurements were also carried out at the site to characterise the exchange between groundwater and surface water 3 2 geophysical surveys at the selected field site the waterborne ert surveys d and e fig 1d carried out perpendicular to the shoreline at the selected field site showed similar patterns to the waterborne resistivity data collected along the shoreline of the lake close to the lakeshore a higher resistivity zone extended up to five meters below the lake surface then increased slightly in thickness in the offshore direction reaching a maximum depth of 6 7 m below the lake surface 200 m offshore fig 4 a b the highest resistivities in the transects of 120 ωm were measured approximately 60 125 m from the lakeshore the location of this high resistivity zone shifted further offshore towards the south covering the area approximately 60 115 m from the lakeshore in the ert transect d fig 4a and 75 125 m from the lakeshore in the ert transect e fig 4b the waterborne gpr line c had a 3 m penetration depth below the lakebed surface but also a strong attenuation of the electromagnetic signal fig 4c underwater sediment structures indicating a coarser material zone were observed 70 m from the shore with the strongest reflections at around 120 m further the structures generally sloped towards the lake the on land ert surveys showed resistivities between 5 and 120 ωm the ert line i fig 5 a approximately parallel to the waterborne ert transect c fig 2c showed a shallow zone of higher resistivity materials with a thickness up to 7 8 m below land surface due to its greater penetration this on land ert survey also showed a second deeper higher resistivity zone of 40 60 ωm in 15 30 m below the land surface that was not captured by the waterborne surveys ert line ii perpendicular to the shoreline fig 5b also showed a similar distribution of sediments with a shallow higher resistivity zone extending up to 8 m below the land surface moreover two other deeper higher resistivity zones one close to the lake corresponding to the similar zone in ert line i and a deeper even higher resistivity zone starting approximately 110 m inland from the lakeshore were observed in the survey the high resistivity values between 125 and 145 m at the eastern end of the transect were most likely due an unsaturated zone in a small mound all together 46 slug tests were carried out in the piezometer network table 1 in two piezometers t23 and t4 table 1 the horizontal hydraulic conductivity could not be measured due to slow recovery and was assumed to be very low when pooling all the slugtest data together 30 slugtests revealed horizontal hydraulic conductivities below 1 1 m d and higher than 3 1 m d in the remaining 16 cases fig 6 b based on the distribution of the horizontal hydraulic conductivity three distinct material types were distinguished in the shallow subsurface i a low conductivity material where slugtests could not be carried out due to the slow recovery ii a material where hydraulic conductivities up to 1 1 m d were measured iii a higher hydraulic conductivity material where values above 3 1 m d were measured combining slugtest data with the ert ii survey the measured resistivity data was also classified into three sediment types i clay with resistivities below 40 ωm ii moraine clay with resistivities between 40 and 80 ωm and iii moraine sand with resistivities above 80 ωm this classification of the sediment types matched that of ahrentzen et al 1987 for danish sediments and agreed well with the slugtest results fig 6b and table 1 as no slugtests could be carried out in the clay a low horizontal hydraulic conductivity of 0 1 m d was assumed for this material the moraine clay and sand were assigned the mean of the horizontal hydraulic conductivity values inferred from the slugtests in the group 0 5 m d for moraine clay and 6 7 m d for moraine sand fig 6b 3 3 lake aquifer connectivity at the selected field site the temperature distribution at the swi 0 200 m offshore shows great spatial and temporal variability measured swi temperatures in december 2016 may and june 2017 varied between 2 05 and 4 75 8 61 14 50 and 15 50 22 80 c respectively groundwater temperature in the area is around 9 9 5 c thus the december and the june surveys were the most optimal to study groundwater discharge to the lake based on swi temperature data the collected swi temperature data fig 7 a c e clearly showed that the swi temperatures close to the shore were strongly influenced by the lake water temperature which in turn was influenced by atmospheric drivers air temperature wind speed and direction etc a visual assessment of the data indicated sharp temperature changes at two locations one approximately 100 m from the shore clearly visible in the june dataset fig 7e and also in the december dataset fig 7a and another at approximately 175 m distance from the shore clearly visible in the may dataset fig 7c and also the june data fig 7e as in the shallow areas of the lake the swi temperatures were more strongly influenced by the air temperature only measurement locations that recurrently qualified as potential discharge locations were taken into account in the analysis thus potential locations of groundwater discharge were delineated where the swi temperature was at least 0 15 c warmer december 2016 or colder may and june 2017 than the average temperature in distances of 5 10 m in the offshore direction from the measurement location fig 7b d f during the december and may measurements the variability in swi temperatures was low and the swi temperatures were close to the groundwater temperature of 9 9 5 c while the june dataset showed the most and largest temperature anomalies in december 2016 there was one strong and consistent step increase of lakebed temperatures at 135 m from the shore that appeared in all measurement days a similarly consistent temperature anomaly was observed at 25 m from the shore in may 2017 swi temperatures at 135 m offshore were colder than their adjacent offshore region during the warmer days but a more consistent drop in temperature was shown at 60 m offshore temperature conditions in june 2017 were ideal for detecting groundwater discharge as the temperature contrast between groundwater and lake water was the largest during this measurement period therefore compared to the december and may surveys more pronounced and consistent drops in swi temperatures were observed in june the consistent cold temperature zone at 135 m offshore were observed again while a new potential zone of groundwater discharge also emerged at 120 m offshore fig 7f fig 8 shows the number of observed temperature anomalies larger than 0 1 c with distance from the lakeshore based on the swi temperatures the measurements from all seasons supported potential groundwater discharge in a zone at 135 140 m from the shore the may and june dataset also agreed on cold temperature anomalies at 60 m offshore based on the water depth data collected along the fiber optic cable the location with the most consistent indication of potential groundwater discharge at 135 m offshore was approximately at the zone where the slope of the lakebed becomes steeper thus showing greater water depths fig 8 3 4 numerical model assigning the average hydraulic conductivities from the slugtests table 1 and fig 6 to the different material zones and assuming an anisotropy ratio of 10 for all three materials the rmse in the base model was 0 33 m then anisotropy ratios of 1 50 and 100 were assigned to each material in the model domain while keeping the other two materials at an anisotropy ratio of 10 the best fit between the observed and modelled data was obtained with an anisotropy ratio of 100 for all three materials in that case the rmse was 0 17 m for this best fit scenario the maximum difference between the observed and simulated heads was 0 34 m the best fit model with an anisotropy ratio of 100 for all three materials indicated groundwater flow towards the lake with the highest upward fluxes of up to 0 01 m d at the wetland bordering the lake but also with a strong horizontal flow component of 0 01 m d towards the lake fig 9 a groundwater discharge also occurred offshore in the lake but its magnitude was substantially decreased by a factor of 15 compared to the magnitude of the discharge at the wetland and in general it decreased with distance from the lakeshore fig 9b in most scenarios with different anisotropy ratios upward fluxes showed two discharge peaks further offshore one at 55 and a second at 140 m from the shore fig 9b the location of these peaks corresponded to areas with the presence of moraine sand in the lakebed inferred from geophysical measurements the even distribution of flow paths in the model domain reflected a relatively homogeneous geology while the general flow paths converged slightly at local moraine clay and sand lenses as detected by the ert surveys fig 5b even though there was a relatively large hydraulic gradient from the eastern model boundary to the lake it resulted in shallow flow paths with large horizontal flow components reaching the surface at the lakeshore fig 9a a potential reason for this could be the presence of higher conductivity materials close to the lakeshore as opposed to the low conductivity clay which is found in the bulk of the model domain at the deeper flow paths 4 discussion 4 1 integration of hydrogeophysical data in the surveyed 4 6 km section of the shoreline several disconnected higher resistivity zones were mapped up to 5 m depth below the lakebed at the selected field site the offshore ert surveys confirmed that this high resistive zone also extended to the shore both waterborne ert and grp surveys agreed on the location of a coarse material zone approximately 60 125 m offshore at the selected site fig 4 here dts surveys also showed a temperature distribution typical of potential groundwater discharge with temperature anomalies larger than 0 15 c occurring consistently over several days figs 7b d f and 8 similar good agreement between ert and dts data was found by slater et al 2010 in a waterborne setting and mawer et al 2016 in an on land infiltration efficiency study based on the results of the waterborne ert along the lakeshore it was inferred that the higher resistivity materials of up to 130 ωm found to 5 m depth below the lakebed represented variations of moraine sand and moraine clay having resistivities around 70 120 and 40 70 ωm respectively fig 2 underlain by clay the distribution of sediments also explained the shallow attenuation depth of the gpr in the surveyed transects fig 3 due to the presence of clayey sediments in the moraine deposits on land drillings and slugtests also agreed on the presence of moraine sand and clay up to the depth of seven meters below the ground and the presence of clay underlying the fine sediments by showing three distinct groups of measured hydraulic conductivities in the range of 0 02 11 3 m d for moraine clay and sand figs 5b and 6 the general clay rich environment with disconnected zones of moraine sand agreed well with the geological background of the area which was shaped by glacial processes being located in front of the glacial front of the weichselian glaciation smed 2013 at the selected field site the cross shore ert transects revealed a high resistivity zone approximately 60 125 m from the shore which agreed with the gpr surveys showing sandy structures at approximately the same distance from the shore fig 4 both the ert and gpr surveys identified this zone with a horizontal extent of approximately 40 m the slight difference in the location of this zone was likely due to the slightly different locations of the geophysical transects fig 1d hence the coarse material zone was located further offshore in the southern direction it is assumed that this coarse material zone further offshore could indicate a previous location of the lakeshore where the wave activity washed away the finer grained sediments leaving the coarse material behind the land ert transect ii perpendicular to the shore also showed that this shallow layer of coarser sediment extended to the lakeshore fig 5 comparing the results of the offshore and on land ert the shallow higher resistivity zone was traced both offshore and on land with a similar elevation below the land surface but slightly greater vertical thickness on land due to the higher surface elevation on land the ert ii survey in the near shore region however showed lower resistivity values for this shallow layer than the waterborne survey the temperature distribution at the lakebed measured by dts during all measurement periods agreed on the location of a potential groundwater discharge zone at approximately 135 m offshore fig 8 at this location lakebed temperatures were warmer than the adjacent offshore area in december and colder in may and june other potential discharge zones could be at 60 65 m offshore but this location was only supported by the may and the june data fig 8 the potential discharge locations indicated by dts agreed well with the highest resistivity materials detected both by waterborne ert and gpr between 60 and 125 m offshore it is assumed that the potential discharge location at 60 m offshore marked the start of the coarse material zone while at 135 m offshore the potential discharge zone is co located with the end of the coarse zone groundwater discharge in the area was likely controlled by sediment heterogeneity with the majority of groundwater discharge at the location with the coarsest shallow sediments this agreed with previous studies where the spatial heterogeneity of groundwater discharge to lakes was governed by sediment heterogeneity kishel and gerla 2002 krabbenhoft and anderson 1986 cherkauer and nader 1989 karan et al 2014 kazmierczak et al 2016 the location of the inferred discharge zone at the lakebed also coincided with a change in the slope of the lakebed becoming steeper further offshore fig 8 this change in the slope could also influence groundwater flow patterns karan et al 2014 by a potential outcrop of a coarser material layer resulting in preferential flow paths krabbenhoft and anderson 1986 which is even more plausible as the high resistivity layer seemed to be almost horizontal in both the offshore and on land ert surveys the change in the lakebed slope could also mean that the shallow horizontal flow paths naturally terminate here and water discharges to the lake 4 2 integration of field data and numerical modelling since the geology of the numerical model was set up based on the ert surveys that in some cases had a limited penetration depth the geology of the deeper model area had a larger inherent uncertainty and a low conductivity moraine clay was assumed for the bulk of the model domain as the study area is located in an ice formed landscape the local geology may necessitate the use of various anisotropy ratios in this study the maximum assumed anisotropy ratio was set to 100 although for instance rosenberry et al 2010 reported an anisotropy ratio of 100 while genereux and bandopadhyay 2001 used anisotropy ratios up to 1000 in their modelling study further karan et al 2014 found increasing anisotropy ratios leading to groundwater discharge further offshore as also found at the present study site a 2d steady state numerical model was used to evaluate the groundwater flow patterns and thus numerically compare the findings of the waterborne geophysical surveys and the dts measurements at the selected field site the model indicated that the bulk of discharge at the shallow flow paths happens on land at approximately 40 80 m distance from the lakeshore fig 9 this agreed well with field observations where the lake was bordered first by a dry area covered with reeds and further on land by a wetland area offshore the numerical model generally predicted decreasing upward fluxes with distance from the lakeshore as described by mcbride and pfannkuch 1975 with two discharge peaks at 60 and 140 m offshore fig 9 these discharge peaks were simulated not only in the best fit scenario but also in the base case using an anisotropy ratio of 10 for all materials as well as during calibration using an anisotropy ratio of 100 for clay case a and moraine clay case b but not for moraine sand case c on fig 9 thus irrespective of the anisotropy of the clay and moraine clay sediments of the model domain the location of the offshore discharge peaks agreed well with both the waterborne geophysical surveys and dts data as the location of the discharge peaks was related to the location of moraine sand it is concluded that in this lake setting offshore groundwater discharge is governed by geological heterogeneity 4 3 practical considerations the waterborne geophysical surveys proved to be an efficient method to map underwater sediments in the lake such waterborne measurements have been combined before slater et al 2010 but not to test the feasibility of lake bank filtration further based on the results of this study this combination of methods is an efficient way to test potential sites not bordering large rivers and lakes where coarse sediments are not found in abundance and the suitable lenses have to be identified with the waterborne ert several kilometre long transects along the shoreline were mapped in a matter of hours however towing an approximately 80 m long chain of floating electrodes the ert surveys were not optimal for mapping shorter transects on the hundred meter scale perpendicular to the shore due to the difficulty of taking turns gpr surveys were better suited for these shorter transects and thus complementary to the ert measurements due to the mobility of the survey equipment and also giving better results crossing sediment structures a limitation of both methods was the penetration depth of the surveys with a configuration of 13 electrodes and 5 m spacing the penetration depth of the ert survey was up to 12 m while with the gpr the attenuation of the electromagnetic waves was strong e g even with a low frequency antenna the penetration depth was 3 5 m below the lakebed this penetration depth was shallow as opposed to the land based surveys but if local sedimentary conditions make it necessary the penetration depth could be extended for the waterborne ert surveys by towing the cable on the lakebed or increasing the length of the streamer cable a further disadvantage of both methods was that they are dependent on weather conditions as strong wind could make sailing and data interpretation more complicated macrophyte growth could also make the ert survey in lakes more difficult in the summer season at bank filtration sites with shallow aquifers similar to the site presented in this study the production wells are ideally placed in a depth and distance from the shore to ensure that the flow path of water from the surface water body is sufficiently long for a thorough physical chemical and biological filtering by the time the water reaches the production well grischek et al 2003 furthermore the installation depth of the production well depends on the purpose of the production well the aquifer location and thickness so that it would be relatively easy to pump water from the surface water through the aquifer while keeping in mind the time necessary for the filtration process and avoiding exposure to contamination from the land surface similar shallow aquifers were reported up to 20 30 m below land surface schubert 2002 ulrich et al 2015 thus falling in the survey range of the waterborne ert the results of this study were also influenced by uncertainties in the measurement methods and data interpretation dts data was analysed by assuming a temperature difference of 0 15 c as an arbitrary limit characterising potential groundwater discharge locations this temperature difference was low but considering the precision of the dts measurements 0 04 0 06 c it was considered capable of reflecting real temperature differences between measurement locations similarly swi temperatures could be considerably influenced by water depth with shallow areas responding to atmospheric influences much faster than deeper areas neilson et al 2010 found that in a stream solar radiation induced an excess temperature of 0 01 0 17 c which could be even higher in a lake environment due to its general nature of standing water relative to streams for this reason measurement locations were compared to the adjacent area in the offshore direction where temperature variability was supposed to be damped compared to the shallower regions on the other hand data collected in this study clearly showed the influence of water depth and mixing processes on measured swi temperatures fig 7a c e where lakebed temperatures change on a sub daily scale waterborne ert measurements were influenced by the resistivity of the lake water and the saturated sediments lake water resistivity data was collected simultaneously to the surveys but discharging groundwater could locally alter lake water resistivity or the resistivity of saturated sediments groundwater samples taken at several locations on land showed that the electrical conductivity of groundwater is considerably higher than the electrical conductivity of the lake thus at focused groundwater discharge sites the saturated sediment resistivity would decrease this means that the higher resistivity layers of this study were correctly identified 5 conclusions in this study waterborne and on land geophysical methods were combined with dts measurements to map the shallow subsurface under a lake to find suitable aquifers that could potentially be used for water extraction for lake bank filtration the study showed that the waterborne ert and gpr surveys and the lakebed dts measurements proved to be an efficient method to find coarse material zones at the lake shore where lake bank filtration could be feasible both the ert and gpr surveys showed a shallow coarser material zone 60 125 m offshore that extended to the lakeshore in up to 6 m depth based on the temperature distribution at the lakebed it was also likely that there is a natural good connection between the lake and the underlying aquifer as dts showed potential groundwater discharge sites at 60 and 135 m offshore corresponding to the coarse material zone indicated by the geophysical surveys using the available geological information from the ert surveys and slugtest data from a piezometer network a 2d groundwater flow model predicted groundwater discharge decreasing with distance from the shore but with two offshore peaks at 60 and 140 m confirming the results of both the geophysical and dts surveys borehole and slugtest data however suggested that the coarser material zone was composed of moraine sand which most likely will not produce the yield expected of a prospective lake bank filtration site it is shown that the presented methodology is robust with the combination of the various surveys corroborating the findings of the individual surveys thus the methodology is assumed to be transferable and applicable in other similar environments acknowledgements the study was funded by

7232,lake tissø is the fourth largest lake in denmark with sufficient continuous surface water input making lake bank filtration an optimal surface water extraction method provided that there are suitable shallow aquifers with a good hydraulic connection to the lake the shallow subsurface under the lake was mapped by five waterborne electrical resistivity tomography ert and eight ground penetrating radar gpr surveys to locate potentially suitable aquifers distributed temperature sensing dts was used for the general characterisation of the hydraulic connection between the lake and aquifer the waterborne ert surveys showed several zones of coarser material along the shore extending up to five meters depth below the lake surface while on land ert surveys confirmed that these zones extend to the lakeshore with similar thickness both waterborne ert and gpr profiles agreed that at a selected field site the highest possibility of coarse sediments is 60 140 m from the lakeshore lakebed temperatures measured in december 2016 may and june 2017 all indicated potential groundwater discharge to the lake at approximately 135 m from the shoreline supporting the results of geophysical surveys showing coarser sediments in that area a 2d numerical flow model of the area with a geological setup based on geophysical information and slugtest data also showed upward groundwater discharge peaks at 60 and 140 m from the shoreline confirming the findings of the field surveys thus this study shows that the combination of waterborne ert and gpr surveys with dts measurements is a fast and efficient way to assess the feasibility of lake bank filtration in these settings this approach of combined hydrogeophysical methods is robust and has a potential to site lake bank filtration areas not only next to large rivers where coarse sediments are found in abundance but even in different sedimentary environments where suitable layers for lake bank filtration are more difficult to identify keywords waterborne hydrogeophysics distributed temperature sensing lake bank filtration 1 introduction the growing population of the world necessitates a more conscious water management with emphasis on both the quality and quantity of water supplies bank filtration is an increasingly used method to meet the demands for both drinking water and industrial process water ray 2008 ghodeif et al 2016 pholkern et al 2015 during bank filtration the surface water is extracted through a pumping well located adjacent to the surface water body schubert 2002 thus the extracted water undergoes physical chemical and biological filtering while flowing from the surface water body through the aquifer to the pumping well hiscock and grischek 2002 holzbecher 2006 this natural filtration and potential attenuation of pollutants may considerably reduce water treatment costs compared to other extraction methods on the other hand water quality in bank filtration wells can be periodically vulnerable due to sudden changes in the hydraulic conditions such as flooding with shorter travel times of surface water to the pumping well wett et al 2002 water extraction by bank filtration is only sustainable if the surface water supplies are replenished continuously and thus most extraction sites are bordering large rivers or in some cases also lakes massmann et al 2008 furthermore it is also required that the surface water bodies are in good hydraulic connection to shallow aquifers geophysical measurements are traditionally used to map structures of subsurface materials also under surface water bodies electrical resistivity measurements survey the resistivity distribution of the subsurface which in turn is related to hydrological properties such as porosity water content and pore fluid conductivity these surveys can be carried out in a waterborne setup where the electrodes can be directly fixed to the bottom of the surface water body towed behind a boat at the bottom or arranged as a streamer cable floating at the water surface loke and lane 2004 these surveys have been used to map sediment properties under surface water bodies loke and lane 2004 crook et al 2008 finding fault zones under rivers kwon et al 2005 and underwater geological controls krantz et al 2004 or to study the geological evolution of sediment sequences colombero et al 2014 ground penetrating radar gpr measurements use high frequency electromagnetic signals to find differences in dielectric properties of the subsurface and thus locate boundaries these measurements are also used over open water to detect sedimentary changes or to estimate bathymetry and water volumes conant et al 2004 lin et al 2009 sambuelli and bava 2012 kidmose et al 2011 in a similar manner these waterborne geophysical methods can be used to detect coarser material zones beneath surface water bodies to optimize the placing of bank filtration wells groundwater discharge to surface water bodies indicates a natural good hydraulic connection to the underlying aquifer traditionally groundwater discharge is mapped and quantified by point scale measurements frequently by seepage meters rosenberry et al 2010 kidmose et al 2011 and vertical sediment temperature profiles schmidt et al 2007 jensen and engesgaard 2011 or in streams on a larger scale by differential gauging briggs et al 2012 poulsen et al 2015 recently distributed temperature sensing dts has been increasingly used to detect groundwater discharge over larger areas at the bottom of surface waters lowry et al 2007 krause et al 2012 sebok et al 2013 or to study infiltration rates at managed aquifer recharge sites vogt et al 2010 becker et al 2013 mawer et al 2016 the dts method relies on the natural difference between the relatively stable groundwater temperature and the seasonally variable surface water temperature where discharging groundwater will influence the temperature distribution at the sediment water interface swi the slight alteration in the swi temperature distribution can be detected by a fibre optic sensor cable deployed at the swi and thus indirectly infer the spatial distribution of groundwater discharge to surface water bodies as of yet dts has mostly been used in shallow surface waters and most frequently in stream environments the deployments of briggs et al 2012 in a stream occasionally deeper than 1 4 m slater et al 2010 in a river with water depths ranging between 2 and 18 m and selker et al 2006 in lake geneva comprise the deepest reported deployments still dts studies in lakes blume et al 2013 sebok et al 2013 are less common due to generally much smaller and slower currents in lakes compared to streams sediment temperatures at the lakebed are more sensitive to physical processes e g solar radiation neilson et al 2010 sebok et al 2013 thermal stratification wilhelm and adrian 2008 wind and wave action churchill and kerfoot 2007 than temperatures at the bed of streams therefore temperatures at the lakebed are influenced by many other processes and conditions in addition to thermal influences due to discharging groundwater so far waterborne geophysical measurements and dts were rarely applied simultaneously even though studies show that they can successfully complement each other when studying groundwater discharge in complex river aquifer systems slater et al 2010 near shore marine environments henderson et al 2010 or when studying infiltration rates at a managed aquifer recharge site mawer et al 2016 the combination of these methods has the potential to be used to select sites for bank filtration around lakes where coarse sediments are not found in such thick layers and in a similar abundance as along large rivers lake tissø is the fourth largest lake in denmark with a constant supply of stream water due to the rising demands for industrial process water the local waterworks kalundborg forsyning a s intends to double the present direct extraction of 5 million m3 year surface water from the lake lake bank filtration could be an optimal extraction method of surface water from the lake potentially reducing water treatment costs provided that there are suitable shallow aquifers along the lakeshore through which lake water can be extracted the overall aim of the study was therefore to assess the feasibility of lake bank filtration at the lake by mapping shallow aquifers under and around the lake and characterizing the present hydraulic connection between these aquifers and the lake the specific objectives of the study were to 1 assess the capability of waterborne ert and gpr measurements to detect shallow aquifers under the lake 2 assess distributed temperature sensing as a tool to map the distribution of groundwater discharge to the lake in greater water depths and seasonally varying lake stage conditions and 3 to test if the combination of these methods can be used in the future to site bank filtration wells 2 material and methods 2 1 field site lake tissø located on the island of sjælland in eastern denmark fig 1 a has a surface area of 12 3 km2 and a topographical catchment of 432 km2 with a surface elevation of 77 m above sea level masl in the east to 1 masl in the west fig 1b groundwater flow in the catchment is generally towards the sea located 5 km to the west from the lake outlet the upper sediments in the area are characterised by quaternary moraine clay sand and gravel layers which are underlain by palaeocene marine clay or chalk the lake is fed mainly by halleby stream running to the lake in the northeast and having an outlet in the southwest fig 1b the average annual discharge of halleby stream just upstream of the outlet to the lake was 2 21 m3 s in the period of 2007 2013 the lake is a natura 2000 protected area and well known for its rich bird population which is one of the reasons that the lake stage is regulated by a weir placed at the outlet of halleby stream to avoid low lake stages during the summer period the annual lake stage varied between 0 84 and 2 61 masl with an average of 1 45 masl in 2007 2017 the lake has a maximum depth of 13 m but nearshore margins are shallow such that water depths 100 m from the shoreline are commonly less than 1 m the local waterworks kalundborg forsyning a s is currently extracting 5 million m3 yr surface water at the western side of the lake fig 1c to use as industrial process water sonnenborg et al 2012 evaluated the impact of climate change on the hydrology of the lake and found the abstraction of water from the lake sustainable even under changing climate conditions but seawater intrusion to the lake may have negative impacts on the lake water quality in the future 2 2 electrical resistivity tomography both on land and waterborne electrical resistivity tomography ert was used to map the properties of saturated sediments under the lakebed and around the lakeshore all together data from five waterborne ert lines were collected fig 1c d three lines along the lakeshore extending in lengths of respectively 2570 1980 and 460 m were surveyed in september and december 2016 depending on the water depth approximately 20 40 m offshore based on the results of these surveys further waterborne ert data was collected at two transects of 187 and 191 m length perpendicular to the shore at the eastern side of the lake in december 2016 fig 1d simultaneously to the resistivity measurements a gps and a sounder were used to measure the location and water depth the water depth along the survey lines along the lakeshore varied between 0 4 and 1 51 m and the resistivity of the lake water was measured to be 22 and 16 5 ωm in september and december respectively corresponding to an electrical conductivity of 498 and 606 μs cm respectively while the electrical conductivity of the shallow groundwater around the lake varied between 690 and 2400 μs cm as measured in the piezometers between september 2016 and july 2017 the water depth and resistivity data were later used to constrain the inversion the ert measurements were carried out using a streamer cable towed behind a boat comprising two transmitter electrodes emitting current pulses of 250 ms length every 2 s and 11 electrodes measuring the resulting potential field the electrodes were spaced 5 m apart with the transmitter electrodes placed in the middle of the cable lakebed resistivity data was collected using a wenner schlumberger layout floats mounted at the electrodes kept the cable floating and towing kept the cable stretched on the lake surface loke and lane 2004 found that the presence of the water layer reduced the penetration depth of the ert survey with floating electrodes by an amount at least equal to the water depth however this method was chosen due to the ease and speed of data acquisition and the presence of seaweed which did not allow the dragging of the cable at the lakebed the penetration depth of the waterborne ert surveys was between 9 and 12 m below the lake surface three on land ert surveys ert i ert ii and ert iii using the wenner layout were carried out fig 1c d data from the transect parallel to the lakeshore ert i was collected in october 2016 with 3 m electrode spacing in a total length of 285 m and an approximate penetration depth of 50 m two transects perpendicular to the shore were measured in february 2017 ert ii was measured with a 2 m electrode spacing in a total length of 190 m and an approximate penetration depth of 30 m while ert iii using an electrode spacing of 5 m in a total length of 475 m had an approximate penetration depth of 60 m both for the on land and waterborne surveys resistivity data was collected using the syscal pro resistivity meter iris instruments orleans france with the sysmar system for the waterborne surveys the inversion was carried out by res2dinv geotomo software using the least squares inversion technique a transect of piezometers was established perpendicular to the shore parallel to ert line ii fig 1d to compare resistivity data to sediment properties inferred from slugtests the 12 piezometers were screened at various depths between 1 5 and 7 m below ground level and were water levelled each month from february 2017 depending on their hydraulic properties up to three slugtests were carried out using the falling head method in 10 piezometers table 1 in the remaining two piezometers t7 and t9 it was not possible to carry out slugtests due to the deformation of piezometer pipes during the installation process in two piezometers b83 and b84 slugtests were carried out at multiple screen depths from 1 to 7 m below the ground level slug test data was analysed using the hvorslev method for unconfined aquifers hvorslev 1951 the hydraulic conductivities were compared to resistivity data from the ert surveys and used to assign horizontal hydraulic conductivity to the sediment layers of the numerical model 2 3 ground penetrating radar to obtain higher resolution information about the subsurface sediments and their depositional structures a waterborne gpr survey was performed in august 2016 using a malå proex system malå geoscience sweden with a 100 mhz shielded antenna towed in an inflatable rubber boat eight transects of the lakebed were surveyed at the eastern lakeshore perpendicular to the shoreline fig 1c in a length of 220 320 m depending on the water depth with a few hundred meters spacing between the transects a sampling frequency of 1000 mhz trace length of 200 ns and a sampling interval of 5 cm were used for the surveys gps data was collected simultaneously data processing was carried out using the reflexw software sandmeier geophysical research germany depending on the sediment properties the penetration depth of the measurements was up to 3 m below the lake bottom 2 4 distributed temperature sensing at the test site on the eastern lakeshore fig 1d lakebed sediment temperature distributions were mapped with dts since the temperature of the discharging groundwater is different and relatively stable compared to surface water temperatures potential groundwater discharge sites can be delineated based on sediment temperature anomalies assuming that discharging groundwater to the lake is indicative of a natural good hydraulic connection to the underlying shallow aquifer the lakebed temperature measurements were used to compare with sediment properties deduced from the waterborne geophysical measurements a brusteel fibre optic cable was deployed at the bottom of the lake in a looped layout fig 1d and attached to a sensornet oryx sr unit lakebed sediment temperature measurements were collected in a dual ended mode each 30 min with 10 min integration time and a measurement spacing of 1 m data were collected during three periods of several days length on 16 19 december 2016 and 12 16 may and 19 22 june 2017 with a precision of 0 04 0 06 and 0 05 c respectively the daily average temperature of the lake water was 3 6 12 2 and 20 3 c during the surveys in december may and june respectively with a stable groundwater temperature of around 9 c thus in december warmer lakebed temperature and in may and june colder lakebed temperature could indicate groundwater discharge to the lake during a gps survey the position of the looped fibre optic cable at the lakebed was georeferenced and detailed information about the depth of the cable below the lake surface fig 1d was collected the survey was carried out on 30 march 2017 when the lake stage was 1 58 m above sea level the highest during the survey while the depth of the fibre optic cable ranged from 0 95 to 4 34 m below the lake water surface fig 1d temperature data from a transect running 0 to 200 m offshore fig 1d was analysed and compared to data from the underwater sediment properties inferred from the waterborne ert and gpr data since the lake is of varying depth and wave action and thermal layering could also influence the temperature observed at the swi the temperature data measured at each location was compared to the average of the swi temperatures measured at 5 10 m distance offshore from the measurement location thus temperature data from each measurement location was compared to the surrounding offshore area instead of an areal average such as done traditionally where colder or warmer areas qualitatively indicated potential groundwater discharge lowry et al 2007 krause et al 2012 sebok et al 2013 in this study measurement locations were considered potential groundwater discharge locations if their measured temperature was colder warmer depending on the season by 0 15 c than the average temperatures surrounding it by 5 10 m distance in the offshore direction the 0 15 c is an arbitrary threshold which was selected by taking the precision of the measurements into account this way the gradual warming winter or cooling summer of the lake water due to increasing water depth and distance from the shore was excluded from the analysis this approach might mean that some potential groundwater discharge locations were not captured but the ones captured in the analysis are not dependent on water depth nor the influence of air temperature 2 5 numerical modelling the compact sediments and water depths above 1 5 m made the installation of temperature probes and seepage meters impossible at the lake bottom further offshore thus numerical modelling was used to integrate and confirm the findings of the hydrogeophysical surveys and the potential discharge zones indicated by the dts measurements at the selected test site a 2d steady state numerical model was set up in modflow harbaugh 2005 the modelled area extended from the middle of the lake to beyond the eastern part of the lake fig 1c where a large unsaturated zone was detected by the ert iii survey the model grid had a cell discretization of 5 0 2 2 m in the x y and z direction the spatial distribution of the materials in the model domain was assigned based on the on land resistivity surveys from ert transects ii and iii and the offshore ert survey d where available fig 1d the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of materials was based on the average horizontal hydraulic conductivity calculated from the slugtests in the piezometers screened in the specific materials see section 3 2 the bottom of the model domain was defined at 50 masl as a no flow boundary as data from neighbouring boreholes indicated a thick eocene marine clay layer at approximately that depth the area of the lake was assigned as a specified head boundary while the eastern model boundary was also a specified head boundary with a hydraulic head given as the lower limit of the unsaturated zone inferred from the ert iii survey a uniform recharge rate of 120 mm yr was applied to the on land model area sonnenborg et al 2012 due to the low topographical gradient of the land area in vicinity of the lake the area is relatively wet thus drains with a conductance of 0 2 1 d in a depth of 0 1 m below the land surface were set in the first 100 m of the near shore area on land as field data from the slugtests was used to assign the hydraulic conductivity of different materials in the model domain see section 3 2 for details on the distribution and properties of these materials the anisotropy of the different materials was manually calibrated against the hydraulic heads measured in the piezometers on 18 april 2017 in the initial model an anisotropy ratio of 10 was assumed for the horizontal to the vertical hydraulic conductivity to approximate the unknown anisotropy ratio for each material the flow model was tested with an anisotropy ratio of 1 50 and 100 head observations from 18 april 2017 were chosen for the calibration as this dataset was approximating best the mean head in the piezometer network during the study period furthermore due to the strongly artesian conditions this was the first dataset where ice in the piezometer pipes did not disturb any of the head measurements and simultaneous head data could be obtained from the piezometer network the lake stage of 1 41 masl as measured on 18 april 2017 was set as a specified head boundary at the area of the lake in order to compare the spatial distribution of the upwelling to the hydrogeophysical surveys the flow entering through the lower cell face in the lake cells 0 210 m from the shore was used to calculate the magnitude and spatial distribution of upwelling 3 results 3 1 large scale geophysical surveys as the lake water resistivity was fairly uniform around the lake it was assumed that resistivity changes in the individual ert profiles reflected changes in the resistivity of saturated sediments under the lake thus indicating changes in material properties with coarser materials potential shallow aquifers showing higher resistivity values at the same time temperature can influence the measured electrical resistivity of sediments by inducing a 1 8 2 2 percent change in bulk electrical conductivity per degree c hayley et al 2007 thus absolute resistivity values obtained from measurements at different seasons may not be directly comparable the root mean square error rmse of the waterborne profiles varied between 1 6 and 5 3 and for the land survey were 1 7 and 1 9 the waterborne ert surveys along the shoreline all showed resistivities from 10 to 150 ωm with a penetration depth of 9 12 m below the lake surface the resistivities measured in the waterborne ert surveys generally corresponded to moraine clay and sand sediments in denmark ahrentzen et al 1987 in all survey lines along the shore relatively higher resistivities coarser materials were observed as discrete zones of up to a few hundred meters in horizontal extent fig 2 resistivity values higher than 40 ωm generally occurred in the upper five meters below the lake surface marked with a red line on fig 2 and were more frequent in the northern and western part of the lake fig 2a sediments five meters below the water surface and deeper showed uniform low resistivities of less than 20 ωm lakebed sediments with the highest resistivities could be found at the eastern shore fig 2c but similarly to the other surveyed areas fig 2a b this zone with higher resistivities did not extend more than five meters below the lake surface the eight gpr transects located perpendicular to the shoreline all clearly showed the elevation of the sediment surface and had a shallow maximum three meter penetration depth below the lakebed in all transects the attenuation of the electromagnetic signal was strong most likely due to sediments with elevated clay content thus only a few underwater sediment structures could be observed due to this strong signal attenuation it was also assumed that the observed sediment structures represented coarser material generally coarser sediments with structures sloping towards the lake could be observed up to approximately 2 m depth below the lakebed fig 3 both at the northern and eastern side of the lake these structures did not appear at the close proximity of the lakeshore but were most pronounced 100 170 m from the shore fig 3 as all gpr transects showed approximately similar results the waterborne ert surveys were used to select a site for detailed field investigations since the zone with the highest resistivity was located at the eastern lakeshore the area was studied with additional smaller scale waterborne and on land ert measurements dts measurements were also carried out at the site to characterise the exchange between groundwater and surface water 3 2 geophysical surveys at the selected field site the waterborne ert surveys d and e fig 1d carried out perpendicular to the shoreline at the selected field site showed similar patterns to the waterborne resistivity data collected along the shoreline of the lake close to the lakeshore a higher resistivity zone extended up to five meters below the lake surface then increased slightly in thickness in the offshore direction reaching a maximum depth of 6 7 m below the lake surface 200 m offshore fig 4 a b the highest resistivities in the transects of 120 ωm were measured approximately 60 125 m from the lakeshore the location of this high resistivity zone shifted further offshore towards the south covering the area approximately 60 115 m from the lakeshore in the ert transect d fig 4a and 75 125 m from the lakeshore in the ert transect e fig 4b the waterborne gpr line c had a 3 m penetration depth below the lakebed surface but also a strong attenuation of the electromagnetic signal fig 4c underwater sediment structures indicating a coarser material zone were observed 70 m from the shore with the strongest reflections at around 120 m further the structures generally sloped towards the lake the on land ert surveys showed resistivities between 5 and 120 ωm the ert line i fig 5 a approximately parallel to the waterborne ert transect c fig 2c showed a shallow zone of higher resistivity materials with a thickness up to 7 8 m below land surface due to its greater penetration this on land ert survey also showed a second deeper higher resistivity zone of 40 60 ωm in 15 30 m below the land surface that was not captured by the waterborne surveys ert line ii perpendicular to the shoreline fig 5b also showed a similar distribution of sediments with a shallow higher resistivity zone extending up to 8 m below the land surface moreover two other deeper higher resistivity zones one close to the lake corresponding to the similar zone in ert line i and a deeper even higher resistivity zone starting approximately 110 m inland from the lakeshore were observed in the survey the high resistivity values between 125 and 145 m at the eastern end of the transect were most likely due an unsaturated zone in a small mound all together 46 slug tests were carried out in the piezometer network table 1 in two piezometers t23 and t4 table 1 the horizontal hydraulic conductivity could not be measured due to slow recovery and was assumed to be very low when pooling all the slugtest data together 30 slugtests revealed horizontal hydraulic conductivities below 1 1 m d and higher than 3 1 m d in the remaining 16 cases fig 6 b based on the distribution of the horizontal hydraulic conductivity three distinct material types were distinguished in the shallow subsurface i a low conductivity material where slugtests could not be carried out due to the slow recovery ii a material where hydraulic conductivities up to 1 1 m d were measured iii a higher hydraulic conductivity material where values above 3 1 m d were measured combining slugtest data with the ert ii survey the measured resistivity data was also classified into three sediment types i clay with resistivities below 40 ωm ii moraine clay with resistivities between 40 and 80 ωm and iii moraine sand with resistivities above 80 ωm this classification of the sediment types matched that of ahrentzen et al 1987 for danish sediments and agreed well with the slugtest results fig 6b and table 1 as no slugtests could be carried out in the clay a low horizontal hydraulic conductivity of 0 1 m d was assumed for this material the moraine clay and sand were assigned the mean of the horizontal hydraulic conductivity values inferred from the slugtests in the group 0 5 m d for moraine clay and 6 7 m d for moraine sand fig 6b 3 3 lake aquifer connectivity at the selected field site the temperature distribution at the swi 0 200 m offshore shows great spatial and temporal variability measured swi temperatures in december 2016 may and june 2017 varied between 2 05 and 4 75 8 61 14 50 and 15 50 22 80 c respectively groundwater temperature in the area is around 9 9 5 c thus the december and the june surveys were the most optimal to study groundwater discharge to the lake based on swi temperature data the collected swi temperature data fig 7 a c e clearly showed that the swi temperatures close to the shore were strongly influenced by the lake water temperature which in turn was influenced by atmospheric drivers air temperature wind speed and direction etc a visual assessment of the data indicated sharp temperature changes at two locations one approximately 100 m from the shore clearly visible in the june dataset fig 7e and also in the december dataset fig 7a and another at approximately 175 m distance from the shore clearly visible in the may dataset fig 7c and also the june data fig 7e as in the shallow areas of the lake the swi temperatures were more strongly influenced by the air temperature only measurement locations that recurrently qualified as potential discharge locations were taken into account in the analysis thus potential locations of groundwater discharge were delineated where the swi temperature was at least 0 15 c warmer december 2016 or colder may and june 2017 than the average temperature in distances of 5 10 m in the offshore direction from the measurement location fig 7b d f during the december and may measurements the variability in swi temperatures was low and the swi temperatures were close to the groundwater temperature of 9 9 5 c while the june dataset showed the most and largest temperature anomalies in december 2016 there was one strong and consistent step increase of lakebed temperatures at 135 m from the shore that appeared in all measurement days a similarly consistent temperature anomaly was observed at 25 m from the shore in may 2017 swi temperatures at 135 m offshore were colder than their adjacent offshore region during the warmer days but a more consistent drop in temperature was shown at 60 m offshore temperature conditions in june 2017 were ideal for detecting groundwater discharge as the temperature contrast between groundwater and lake water was the largest during this measurement period therefore compared to the december and may surveys more pronounced and consistent drops in swi temperatures were observed in june the consistent cold temperature zone at 135 m offshore were observed again while a new potential zone of groundwater discharge also emerged at 120 m offshore fig 7f fig 8 shows the number of observed temperature anomalies larger than 0 1 c with distance from the lakeshore based on the swi temperatures the measurements from all seasons supported potential groundwater discharge in a zone at 135 140 m from the shore the may and june dataset also agreed on cold temperature anomalies at 60 m offshore based on the water depth data collected along the fiber optic cable the location with the most consistent indication of potential groundwater discharge at 135 m offshore was approximately at the zone where the slope of the lakebed becomes steeper thus showing greater water depths fig 8 3 4 numerical model assigning the average hydraulic conductivities from the slugtests table 1 and fig 6 to the different material zones and assuming an anisotropy ratio of 10 for all three materials the rmse in the base model was 0 33 m then anisotropy ratios of 1 50 and 100 were assigned to each material in the model domain while keeping the other two materials at an anisotropy ratio of 10 the best fit between the observed and modelled data was obtained with an anisotropy ratio of 100 for all three materials in that case the rmse was 0 17 m for this best fit scenario the maximum difference between the observed and simulated heads was 0 34 m the best fit model with an anisotropy ratio of 100 for all three materials indicated groundwater flow towards the lake with the highest upward fluxes of up to 0 01 m d at the wetland bordering the lake but also with a strong horizontal flow component of 0 01 m d towards the lake fig 9 a groundwater discharge also occurred offshore in the lake but its magnitude was substantially decreased by a factor of 15 compared to the magnitude of the discharge at the wetland and in general it decreased with distance from the lakeshore fig 9b in most scenarios with different anisotropy ratios upward fluxes showed two discharge peaks further offshore one at 55 and a second at 140 m from the shore fig 9b the location of these peaks corresponded to areas with the presence of moraine sand in the lakebed inferred from geophysical measurements the even distribution of flow paths in the model domain reflected a relatively homogeneous geology while the general flow paths converged slightly at local moraine clay and sand lenses as detected by the ert surveys fig 5b even though there was a relatively large hydraulic gradient from the eastern model boundary to the lake it resulted in shallow flow paths with large horizontal flow components reaching the surface at the lakeshore fig 9a a potential reason for this could be the presence of higher conductivity materials close to the lakeshore as opposed to the low conductivity clay which is found in the bulk of the model domain at the deeper flow paths 4 discussion 4 1 integration of hydrogeophysical data in the surveyed 4 6 km section of the shoreline several disconnected higher resistivity zones were mapped up to 5 m depth below the lakebed at the selected field site the offshore ert surveys confirmed that this high resistive zone also extended to the shore both waterborne ert and grp surveys agreed on the location of a coarse material zone approximately 60 125 m offshore at the selected site fig 4 here dts surveys also showed a temperature distribution typical of potential groundwater discharge with temperature anomalies larger than 0 15 c occurring consistently over several days figs 7b d f and 8 similar good agreement between ert and dts data was found by slater et al 2010 in a waterborne setting and mawer et al 2016 in an on land infiltration efficiency study based on the results of the waterborne ert along the lakeshore it was inferred that the higher resistivity materials of up to 130 ωm found to 5 m depth below the lakebed represented variations of moraine sand and moraine clay having resistivities around 70 120 and 40 70 ωm respectively fig 2 underlain by clay the distribution of sediments also explained the shallow attenuation depth of the gpr in the surveyed transects fig 3 due to the presence of clayey sediments in the moraine deposits on land drillings and slugtests also agreed on the presence of moraine sand and clay up to the depth of seven meters below the ground and the presence of clay underlying the fine sediments by showing three distinct groups of measured hydraulic conductivities in the range of 0 02 11 3 m d for moraine clay and sand figs 5b and 6 the general clay rich environment with disconnected zones of moraine sand agreed well with the geological background of the area which was shaped by glacial processes being located in front of the glacial front of the weichselian glaciation smed 2013 at the selected field site the cross shore ert transects revealed a high resistivity zone approximately 60 125 m from the shore which agreed with the gpr surveys showing sandy structures at approximately the same distance from the shore fig 4 both the ert and gpr surveys identified this zone with a horizontal extent of approximately 40 m the slight difference in the location of this zone was likely due to the slightly different locations of the geophysical transects fig 1d hence the coarse material zone was located further offshore in the southern direction it is assumed that this coarse material zone further offshore could indicate a previous location of the lakeshore where the wave activity washed away the finer grained sediments leaving the coarse material behind the land ert transect ii perpendicular to the shore also showed that this shallow layer of coarser sediment extended to the lakeshore fig 5 comparing the results of the offshore and on land ert the shallow higher resistivity zone was traced both offshore and on land with a similar elevation below the land surface but slightly greater vertical thickness on land due to the higher surface elevation on land the ert ii survey in the near shore region however showed lower resistivity values for this shallow layer than the waterborne survey the temperature distribution at the lakebed measured by dts during all measurement periods agreed on the location of a potential groundwater discharge zone at approximately 135 m offshore fig 8 at this location lakebed temperatures were warmer than the adjacent offshore area in december and colder in may and june other potential discharge zones could be at 60 65 m offshore but this location was only supported by the may and the june data fig 8 the potential discharge locations indicated by dts agreed well with the highest resistivity materials detected both by waterborne ert and gpr between 60 and 125 m offshore it is assumed that the potential discharge location at 60 m offshore marked the start of the coarse material zone while at 135 m offshore the potential discharge zone is co located with the end of the coarse zone groundwater discharge in the area was likely controlled by sediment heterogeneity with the majority of groundwater discharge at the location with the coarsest shallow sediments this agreed with previous studies where the spatial heterogeneity of groundwater discharge to lakes was governed by sediment heterogeneity kishel and gerla 2002 krabbenhoft and anderson 1986 cherkauer and nader 1989 karan et al 2014 kazmierczak et al 2016 the location of the inferred discharge zone at the lakebed also coincided with a change in the slope of the lakebed becoming steeper further offshore fig 8 this change in the slope could also influence groundwater flow patterns karan et al 2014 by a potential outcrop of a coarser material layer resulting in preferential flow paths krabbenhoft and anderson 1986 which is even more plausible as the high resistivity layer seemed to be almost horizontal in both the offshore and on land ert surveys the change in the lakebed slope could also mean that the shallow horizontal flow paths naturally terminate here and water discharges to the lake 4 2 integration of field data and numerical modelling since the geology of the numerical model was set up based on the ert surveys that in some cases had a limited penetration depth the geology of the deeper model area had a larger inherent uncertainty and a low conductivity moraine clay was assumed for the bulk of the model domain as the study area is located in an ice formed landscape the local geology may necessitate the use of various anisotropy ratios in this study the maximum assumed anisotropy ratio was set to 100 although for instance rosenberry et al 2010 reported an anisotropy ratio of 100 while genereux and bandopadhyay 2001 used anisotropy ratios up to 1000 in their modelling study further karan et al 2014 found increasing anisotropy ratios leading to groundwater discharge further offshore as also found at the present study site a 2d steady state numerical model was used to evaluate the groundwater flow patterns and thus numerically compare the findings of the waterborne geophysical surveys and the dts measurements at the selected field site the model indicated that the bulk of discharge at the shallow flow paths happens on land at approximately 40 80 m distance from the lakeshore fig 9 this agreed well with field observations where the lake was bordered first by a dry area covered with reeds and further on land by a wetland area offshore the numerical model generally predicted decreasing upward fluxes with distance from the lakeshore as described by mcbride and pfannkuch 1975 with two discharge peaks at 60 and 140 m offshore fig 9 these discharge peaks were simulated not only in the best fit scenario but also in the base case using an anisotropy ratio of 10 for all materials as well as during calibration using an anisotropy ratio of 100 for clay case a and moraine clay case b but not for moraine sand case c on fig 9 thus irrespective of the anisotropy of the clay and moraine clay sediments of the model domain the location of the offshore discharge peaks agreed well with both the waterborne geophysical surveys and dts data as the location of the discharge peaks was related to the location of moraine sand it is concluded that in this lake setting offshore groundwater discharge is governed by geological heterogeneity 4 3 practical considerations the waterborne geophysical surveys proved to be an efficient method to map underwater sediments in the lake such waterborne measurements have been combined before slater et al 2010 but not to test the feasibility of lake bank filtration further based on the results of this study this combination of methods is an efficient way to test potential sites not bordering large rivers and lakes where coarse sediments are not found in abundance and the suitable lenses have to be identified with the waterborne ert several kilometre long transects along the shoreline were mapped in a matter of hours however towing an approximately 80 m long chain of floating electrodes the ert surveys were not optimal for mapping shorter transects on the hundred meter scale perpendicular to the shore due to the difficulty of taking turns gpr surveys were better suited for these shorter transects and thus complementary to the ert measurements due to the mobility of the survey equipment and also giving better results crossing sediment structures a limitation of both methods was the penetration depth of the surveys with a configuration of 13 electrodes and 5 m spacing the penetration depth of the ert survey was up to 12 m while with the gpr the attenuation of the electromagnetic waves was strong e g even with a low frequency antenna the penetration depth was 3 5 m below the lakebed this penetration depth was shallow as opposed to the land based surveys but if local sedimentary conditions make it necessary the penetration depth could be extended for the waterborne ert surveys by towing the cable on the lakebed or increasing the length of the streamer cable a further disadvantage of both methods was that they are dependent on weather conditions as strong wind could make sailing and data interpretation more complicated macrophyte growth could also make the ert survey in lakes more difficult in the summer season at bank filtration sites with shallow aquifers similar to the site presented in this study the production wells are ideally placed in a depth and distance from the shore to ensure that the flow path of water from the surface water body is sufficiently long for a thorough physical chemical and biological filtering by the time the water reaches the production well grischek et al 2003 furthermore the installation depth of the production well depends on the purpose of the production well the aquifer location and thickness so that it would be relatively easy to pump water from the surface water through the aquifer while keeping in mind the time necessary for the filtration process and avoiding exposure to contamination from the land surface similar shallow aquifers were reported up to 20 30 m below land surface schubert 2002 ulrich et al 2015 thus falling in the survey range of the waterborne ert the results of this study were also influenced by uncertainties in the measurement methods and data interpretation dts data was analysed by assuming a temperature difference of 0 15 c as an arbitrary limit characterising potential groundwater discharge locations this temperature difference was low but considering the precision of the dts measurements 0 04 0 06 c it was considered capable of reflecting real temperature differences between measurement locations similarly swi temperatures could be considerably influenced by water depth with shallow areas responding to atmospheric influences much faster than deeper areas neilson et al 2010 found that in a stream solar radiation induced an excess temperature of 0 01 0 17 c which could be even higher in a lake environment due to its general nature of standing water relative to streams for this reason measurement locations were compared to the adjacent area in the offshore direction where temperature variability was supposed to be damped compared to the shallower regions on the other hand data collected in this study clearly showed the influence of water depth and mixing processes on measured swi temperatures fig 7a c e where lakebed temperatures change on a sub daily scale waterborne ert measurements were influenced by the resistivity of the lake water and the saturated sediments lake water resistivity data was collected simultaneously to the surveys but discharging groundwater could locally alter lake water resistivity or the resistivity of saturated sediments groundwater samples taken at several locations on land showed that the electrical conductivity of groundwater is considerably higher than the electrical conductivity of the lake thus at focused groundwater discharge sites the saturated sediment resistivity would decrease this means that the higher resistivity layers of this study were correctly identified 5 conclusions in this study waterborne and on land geophysical methods were combined with dts measurements to map the shallow subsurface under a lake to find suitable aquifers that could potentially be used for water extraction for lake bank filtration the study showed that the waterborne ert and gpr surveys and the lakebed dts measurements proved to be an efficient method to find coarse material zones at the lake shore where lake bank filtration could be feasible both the ert and gpr surveys showed a shallow coarser material zone 60 125 m offshore that extended to the lakeshore in up to 6 m depth based on the temperature distribution at the lakebed it was also likely that there is a natural good connection between the lake and the underlying aquifer as dts showed potential groundwater discharge sites at 60 and 135 m offshore corresponding to the coarse material zone indicated by the geophysical surveys using the available geological information from the ert surveys and slugtest data from a piezometer network a 2d groundwater flow model predicted groundwater discharge decreasing with distance from the shore but with two

7233,the local meteoric water line lmwl reflects the relationship between stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation and is usually calculated using an ordinary least squares regression olsr when event based data are used to calculate a lmwl the differences in precipitation amount of samples are not considered using olsr which in turn may influence the representativeness of the lmwl for local hydrology small rain events occur widely in arid central asia annual mean precipitation 150 mm and where smaller precipitation has lower deuterium excess this results in lmwls with slopes and intercepts lower than the global average based on an observation network of isotopes in precipitation across the tianshan mountains in arid central asia lmwls for 23 stations are calculated from event based data from 2012 to 2013 n 978 using ordinary least squares reduced major axis and major axis regressions and their precipitation weighted counterparts for the northern slope and mountainous areas the lmwl slope and intercept are close to the global meteoric water line gmwl but the slope and intercept are lower for the southern slope indicating the greater dominance of sub cloud evaporation the effect of moisture recycling in the irrigated areas on the northern slope also can be seen where the lmwl slopes are 8 using a precipitation weighted regression method with event based data especially precipitation weighted reduced major axis regression pwrma is generally consistent with the olsr regression using monthly data however event based datasets provide a wider range of values to better constrain the regression than can be achieved using monthly data over a short period providing a sounder basis for determining lmwls for relatively short term sampling campaigns in an arid setting the use of the pwrma regression is preferred for determining the lmwl for the tianshan mountains and results in a regional meteoric water line of δd 7 9δ 18o 10 16 keywords stable isotope local meteoric water line arid central asia precipitation weighted regression 1 introduction the stable isotopes of hydrogen δd and oxygen δ 18o in precipitation have been widely applied in studies of hydrological processes e g aggarwal et al 2016 sprenger et al 2016 zhang and wang 2016 fischer et al 2017 and the relationship between δd and δ 18o in precipitation underpins many studies using isotopic approaches a strong linear relationship between δd and δ 18o in natural water was noticed in the mid 20th century friedman 1953 based on approximately 400 samples 40 from north america and the rest distributed across the world the best fit line of δd δ 18o δd 8δ 18o 10 was presented by craig 1961 and was later named the global meteoric water line gmwl with the establishment of the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip iaea wmo 2017 the gmwl was updated using longer time series and more stations worldwide e g yurtsever and gat 1981 rozanski et al 1993 gourcy et al 2005 which confirmed that δd 8δ 18o 10 was still a good approximation for the gmwl the equation relating δd to δ 18o at a site is defined as a local meteoric water line lmwl and can provide a reference point for interpretation of stable isotopic compositions of a range of water samples in an area influenced by many geographic and meteorological factors the slopes and intercepts of lmwls vary depending on location the comparison of the lmwl and gmwl can be used to assess moisture sources and precipitation processes and may indicate the degree of sub cloud evaporation or the contribution of re evaporated moisture to precipitation at a site an ordinary least squares regression olsr is widely used to determine the lmwl and this regression method logically gives all data points equal weighting iaea 1992 hughes and crawford 2012 regarding the data used to calculate the regression three options are commonly considered 1 use each month of data or each sample for event based sampling 2 use the precipitation amount weighted average δ 18o and δ 2h values for each month n 12 and 3 use annual precipitation amount weighted averages of δ 18o and δ 2h n years of record to reduce the influence of precipitation amount on lmwl monthly and annual weighted values have been recommended by the iaea 1992 the method of pooling all samples in one month and measuring the composite as is generally done for gnip stations does in fact partly weight the data for the size of events particularly where rainfall occurs frequently the isotopic composition of event based samples can provide detailed information about water processes especially the short term water vapor transport and rainout e g risi et al 2008 baldini et al 2010 crawford et al 2013 during recent years stable isotopes in event based precipitation have been widely investigated often based on sampling durations of approximately one or two years the relatively short duration of studies may increase the uncertainty of lmwls determined using event based samples impacted by secondary evaporation of falling raindrops in the atmosphere the equations relating δd to δ 18o for smaller amount events usually show lower slopes and intercepts peng et al 2007 and light precipitation events usually have a relatively enriched δ 18o dansgaard 1964 bony et al 2008 and low deuterium excess d excess defined as d δd 8δ 18o liu et al 2008 wu et al 2015 in some studies the smaller precipitation samples are even totally excluded in calculation e g harvey 2001 hughes and crawford 2013 small rain events which occur widely in arid and semi arid regions fu et al 2008 liu et al 2011 may therefore influence the representativeness of a lmwl for local conditions in studies of major flow processes and water storage heavy rainfall events normally play a dominant role and applying equal weights to each sample may lead to a hydrologically unrepresentative result alternative methods including precipitation weighted approaches are therefore valuable in determining lmwls especially in arid climates hughes and crawford 2012 crawford et al 2014 besides olsr a reduced major axis least squares regression rma was introduced by iaea 1992 and is suitable for the constant ratio of y and x value standard deviations an error in variables generalized least squared regression genls was presented by argiriou and lykoudis 2006 and allowed the errors of variables to be non constant and instead incorporate the measurement uncertainties hughes and crawford 2012 introduced the use of precipitation weighted least squares regression pwlsr which can reduce the biases of small rainfall events to increase the usefulness for groundwater and surface hydrology applications crawford et al 2014 then introduced two additional precipitation weighted regressions to determine lmwl and made a comparison between these and non weighted regressions using gnip data all regressions result in a similar fit if a strong linear relationship exists but the difference in fit is significant for some coastal and oceanic sites with a poor linear relationship between δd and δ 18o even though monthly precipitation weighted values were used in the current version of iaea international atomic energy agency water isotope system for data analysis iaea wmo 2017 three types of lmwl are available for each gnip station including olsr rma and pwlsr the arid region of central asia lies at the inland of the eurasian continent where marine moisture from surrounding oceans rarely reaches fig 1 the westerlies and polar vapor are usually considered as the dominant precipitation sources araguás araguás et al 1998 tian et al 2007 wang et al 2017 yao et al 2013 zhang and wang 2018 regional mean precipitation in arid central asia is 150 mm per year chen 2012 ranging from 10 mm at some desert basins to 500 mm at some mountainous sites the tianshan mountains also known as tien shan spanning multiple countries are the main mountain ranges in arid central asia a series of oases are distributed along the northern and southern slopes of the tianshan mountains and many low lying deserts such as the taklimakan and gurbantunggut deserts lie near the mountains the oasis belt is also called the tianshan corridor and is a vital section of the ancient silk road in such an arid region the local meteoric water line is an important reference in hydrological studies and development of a meteoric water line using limited precipitation samples needs to be carefully considered oberhänsli et al 2009 huang and pang 2010 however across the tianshan mountains the only existing lmwls are for several closely located sites near urumqi pang et al 2011 liu et al 2014 and for the whole region wang et al 2016c in this study lmwls for 23 sampling stations covering 500 000 km2 across the tianshan mountains china are presented using multiple regressions although the observation period is still relatively short the network provides a platform to understand the spatial pattern of lmwl in addition the differences between precipitation weighted and unweighted regressions are considered and meteorological controls on lmwls are discussed 2 data and methods 2 1 observation network according to the physico geographic regionalization of arid land in china chen 2010 there are five natural areas across this region fig 1 and table 1 1 the junggar basin desert area this area generally lies at the northern slope of the tianshan mountains and many small inland rivers flow to the northern desert due to the moisture path of westerlies the precipitation amount for the western portion is larger than that for the eastern portion 2 the ili bayanbulak mountain area this area generally consists of a westward river valley at the western portion ili and a high altitude basin at the eastern portion bayanbulak for the ili portion the topography of westward valley captures plenty of westerly moisture and leads to a relatively humid climate and a westward ili river flowing to the balkhash lake for the bayanbulak portion a vast wetland is located at the center and the river flows to the southern desert 3 the tarim basin desert area this area lies at the southern slope of the tianshan mountains and the climate is more arid than that in the northern slope due to the rain shadow effect of surrounding high mountains i e the tianshan mountains and the tibetan plateau the inland rivers originating from the mountains flow to the southern desert 4 the turpan basin desert area the area is a very arid basin with minimum elevation of 154 m and lies at the southern slope of the eastern tianshan mountains china s long term meteorological record with the lowest mean precipitation amount 10 mm occurs for this area 5 the hami gobi desert area this area lies at the eastern extremity of the southern slope of the tianshan mountains and is at the western edge of the vast gobi desert in 2012 an integrated observation network of stable isotopes in precipitation was established across the tianshan mountains arid central asia wang et al 2016c in this network all the natural areas across the chinese tianshan mountains were well covered considering the climate type and observation network the neighboring hami gobi and turpan basin are combined in this study turpan hami under a typical continental climate air temperature in arid central asia shows a seasonal variation with warm wet summers and cold dry winters wang et al 2016c generally the annual mean temperatures fig 2 a of junggar and ili bayanbulak are lower than the other natural areas although the temperature in ili bayanbulak shows a wide spatial variability due to the complex topography in the mountains in fig 2b the precipitation amount in ili bayanbulak is usually larger than the other areas and the very limited precipitation is seen in turpan hami although some sites in tarim receive a similar magnitude of annual precipitation as junggar the regional mean precipitation amount in tarim is far less than that in junggar meteorological statistics during 1961 2005 shi et al 2008 indicate that the annual mean precipitation at the chinese tianshan mountains is 409 mm but the amounts for the junggar and tarim basins are 277 mm and 66 mm respectively in addition the difference between the long term climatological averages for annual air temperature and precipitation amount and the data from this study is also shown in fig 2 indicating a similar temperature for the different periods but with most sites having a higher than average precipitation during the study period the precipitation amount during 2012 2013 is 114 of long term average ranging from 76 to 144 except aksu 184 and shisanjianfang 31 and is 22 1 mm more than long term average ranging between 16 9 mm and 67 3 mm except akqi 105 6 mm the pearson correlation coefficients between the long term values and those of the current study were 0 99 0 97 and 0 95 for temperature precipitation amount and relative humidity respectively with a slope of 1 for the line of best fit between long term and study period temperature and relative humidity and 0 84 for precipitation this indicates that the sampling period was not atypical a more detailed comparison for each station is presented in wang et al 2016c from august 2012 to september 2013 a total of 1052 event based precipitation samples were collected at 23 stations wang et al 2016c the basic spatial pattern of stable isotope composition in precipitation across the network was analyzed in wang et al 2016c and some influencing factors including moisture recycling below cloud evaporation moisture trajectory and synoptic condition were discussed in recent studies e g wang et al 2016a b 2017 zhang and wang 2018 in this study a full year subset of the samples collected from september 2012 to august 2013 was used to calculate lmwls and data for a total of 978 samples out of 1052 were used representing a 12 month subset all the samples were collected manually as individual events by full time meteorological observers at each station to prevent evaporation rain samples were collected immediately after the end of rainfall and then stored in 60 ml hdpe high density polyethylene bottles with waterproof seals snow samples were melted at room temperature in a plastic bag before being bottled the precipitation amounts during the rain snow events were measured manually the other meteorological parameters including air temperature and relative humidity were recorded by automatic weather stations and then checked against manual observations the stable isotopic composition was analyzed using a liquid water isotope analyzer dlt 100 los gatos research inc at the stable isotope laboratory college of geography and environmental science northwest normal university every precipitation sample and isotopic standard was injected sequentially six times and the first two injections were discarded because of memory effects the measured results of isotopic compositions are expressed in delta notation δ value which is the deviation of the sample relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow the measurement precision σ was 0 6 for δd and 0 2 for δ 18o respectively a more detailed description of sampling and analysis is found in wang et al 2016c 2 2 gnip and chnip data to compare the isotopic compositions in precipitation during the sampling period and other years the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip data from urumqi gnip site 5182801 wulumuqi 87 37 e 43 47 n 918 m a s l iaea wmo 2017 and the chinese network of isotopes in precipitation chnip data from fukang 87 56 e 44 17 n 460 m a s l approximately 60 km to the north liu et al 2014 were used in the gnip database monthly isotopes in urumqi precipitation were measured for 131 months and mainly covered three periods i e 1986 1992 1995 1998 and 2001 2003 chnip data for fukang are available for 48 months 2005 2007 and 2009 2 3 lmwl methods ordinary least squares regression olsr is the most commonly used method in calculating a lmwl and gives equal weighting to each sample iaea 1992 besides olsr reduced major axis regression rma and major axis regression ma are two alternative regression methods without precipitation weighting iaea 1992 crawford et al 2014 consistent with olsr rma and ma the corresponding amount weighted regressions defined by hughes and crawford 2012 and crawford et al 2014 are precipitation weighted least squares regression pwlsr precipitation weighted reduced major axis regression pwrma and precipitation weighted major axis regression pwma respectively all six regressions are integrated in local meteoric water line freeware updated in november 2014 available at http openscience ansto gov au collection 879 and this program was applied to the samples in this study according to crawford et al 2014 the average value of root mean sum of squared error rmsseav may be used to judge the regression where a value of rmsseav close to 1 denotes a close fit the s tatistical significance is assessed using the t test in this study the program available at https www danielsoper com statcalc calculator aspx id 103 soper 2017 with method described in cohen et al 2003 was used to calculate the significance of the difference in slopes between two different subsets of the data using the same regression 3 results and discussion 3 1 weighted and non weighted lmwl results 3 1 1 spatial pattern of lmwl based on the 978 event based precipitation samples collected at 23 stations across the tianshan mountains meteoric water lines mwl were determined for each station and sub region using the six methods outlined above fig 3 and tables s1 s3 in supplementary material using the most common method olsr the mwl for the whole study area n 978 is δd 7 38 0 04 δ 18o 0 33 0 55 r 2 0 97 p 0 01 if pwrma is used the mwl is very close to the gmwl δd 7 90 0 04 δ 18o 10 16 0 50 for individual stations olsr slopes range between 6 26 0 33 luntai and 8 30 0 21 qitai and are somewhat lower for the southern slope than for the northern slope and mountains similar patterns can also be found for the intercepts of lmwls table s2 using the monthly precipitation weighted values from all sampling sites resulted in an olsr meteoric water line of δd 7 67 0 08 δ 18o 3 32 1 15 n 207 r 2 0 98 p 0 01 figs 4 and 5 and tables s4 s6 in supplementary material where both the slope and intercept were larger than those determined using olsr with all the event based data to understand the gap between event based and monthly data the lmwls were calculated using alternative approaches figs 4 and 5 and tables s1 s3 in general olsr rma ma pwlsr pwrma and pwma have an increasing trend in slope i e a olsr a rma a ma a pwlsr a pwrma a pwma for all the samples this order was also seen in all the natural areas for most stations the differences based on alternative regressions showed a trend consistent with the hypothesis that below cloud evaporation of small rainfall amounts influences the slope of the lmwl in most natural areas except turpan hami fig 4 the weighted lmwl slopes using event based data are closer to the olsr based lmwl slopes using monthly data compared with the unweighted lmwl slope in fig s1 the olsr slopes using monthly data are compared with alternative slopes using event based data for each station it is clear that the weighted methods using event based samples especially pwrma are generally consistent with the olsr method using monthly data the exception is turpan hami where using a monthly regression does not increase the slope relative to olsr on event based data this is because the very low rainfall amounts in this region table s6 mean that even when the data is aggregated to a monthly time step a low d excess signal can remain in this study we presented lmwls in arid central asia based on an observation network of 23 stations although the lmwl is widely used as a frame of reference in isotope hydrology the most commonly used lmwl in this region is based on gnip chnip stations similarly located to the north of tianshan mountains at urumqi and fukang generally both the olsr slope 7 67 and intercept 3 32 in this study region are much lower than the global meteoric water line δd 8δ 18o 10 craig 1961 because of its aridity the range of lmwls found in this region is not inconsistent with those found for fukang and urumqi by liu et al 2014 however the slope and intercept varies significantly over the region in a way that is not captured by previous work in central asia the meteorological parameters especially air temperature and precipitation amount vary depending on location leading to a complex spatial pattern of isotope composition and lmwl in precipitation the study region is divided into four natural areas and the spatial diversity in lmwl for each area reflects the different climate backgrounds in the northern slope and the mountainous region with relatively humid conditions and low temperature the lmwl slopes are always higher than those along the arid southern slope further analysis confirmed the meteorological controls on lmwl which were consistent with the spatial pattern the trend of lmwl with different meteorological conditions is similar to previous studies e g peng et al 2007 wu et al 2015 chen et al 2015 and is generally presumed to be influenced by below cloud evaporation for the northern slope and mountainous region the combined slope and intercept are close to the gmwl however along the southern slope the lmwl slopes are lower than the gwml indicating the greater dominance of sub cloud evaporation in this more arid sub region which is supported by our earlier simulation using a modified stewart model wang et al 2016b in contrast some of the northern slope sites have a higher lmwl slope reflecting the contribution of re evaporation from irrigated land and open water in summer wang et al 2016a 3 1 2 meteorological controls on lmwls the variations in lmwls derived using different regressions are clearly related to meteorological conditions for each station four meteorological parameters were considered in this study precipitation amount p air temperature t and relative humidity rh recorded during each precipitation event data from all sites were combined and each of the six lmwl regressions calculated for samples corresponding to each meteorological parameter range fig 6 and tables s7 s9 in supplementary material the linear relationship between each of these variables and the slope of the lmwl for any method is strong most precipitation events were small with 78 8 of samples 771 representing a precipitation amount 5 mm and 91 7 897 samples being 10 mm as shown in fig 6a lmwls based on lower precipitation amounts usually had lower slopes and larger slopes were seen when using samples with larger precipitation amounts in fig 6b the lmwl slope for events with air temperature 20 c was between 5 and 7 depending on the regression method and the slope for samples collected at 0 c was generally 8 the trends in lmwl intercept table s8 in supplementary material were generally similar as those of slopes higher slopes and intercepts were seen for the conditions of higher precipitation amount and relative humidity as well as lower air temperature generally for conditions under which sub cloud evaporation is more likely low precipitation amounts high temperature low relative humidity the slopes were smaller and a large variation was obtained using the different regression techniques 3 1 3 influence of heavy and small precipitation on lmwls the primary reason to use precipitation weighting is to ensure that heavier rainfall events influence the lmwl equation in proportion to their hydrological importance to evaluate the importance of this across the tianshan mountains region we calculated lmwls after removing the heavy precipitation in stages p 30 mm p 20 mm and p 10 mm table 2 and tables s10 and s11 in supplementary material across the entire study region the removal of precipitation 20 mm has a limited influence on lmwl slopes for any method for the unweighted regressions the difference in slope from removing precipitation 10 mm was close to zero for precipitation weighted regressions the change in slope was also small and generally only seen clearly for the p 10 mm subset the influence of small precipitation events on lmwls is also seen in table 2 compared with heavy precipitation the variations of lmwls when removing small precipitation 0 5 mm 1 mm or 5 mm are much larger this is to be expected given the lower d excess of many of these samples generally the removal of small precipitation may result in a larger lmwl slope and the difference in slope using the unweighted regressions is larger than that using the precipitation weighted regressions in effect the removal of small precipitation amounts may be considered an arbitrary alternative to precipitation weighting and for precipitation weighted regressions the effect of these small rainfall events is already minimized it is significant for many of the non weighted regressions but hardly at all for the weighted regressions proving that weighting really is effective at removing any bias due to sample amount the removal of rainfall of 1 mm or 5 mm is equivalent to precipitation weighting for each of the regressions the results when only those precipitation amounts of 5 mm were used indicate little difference in the slopes between the different regression techniques 3 2 necessity and potential application of weighted regressions a key question to consider is given the small difference statistically between weighted and non weighted regressions is it justified to use weighted regressions at all statistically one might say no however the effect of weighting is clearly increasing the slope in all cases and if we agree that the justification for weighting of removing a systematic bias in the regression is sound then this should be considered the standard rather than olsr in the past several years stable isotope compositions in precipitation on an event or synoptic scale have aroused great attention in china and other countries in many studies event based data over a relatively short period is used directly to determine a lmwl and for comparison with mwls using monthly gnip station data the potential influence of irregular sample frequency or short duration is not always considered because of the limited data availability interestingly in this study the precipitation weighted regressions using event based data were similar to unweighted lmwls using the monthly data except in the most arid turpan hami region this indicates that the influence of sample frequency should be carefully considered if we have only a short term event based precipitation isotope record spanning for example a year especially in an arid climate the weighted regression can be considered as a strong alternative in some locations where seasonal variations in precipitation isotope composition are small using event based data rather than monthly averages may allow the slope of the lmwl to be better defined by increasing the range of input values to the regression however in the tianshan mountains the large seasonal range in the monthly averages fig 4 in wang et al 2016c helps to constrain the slope of the regression which is why the effect of the amount weighting is less pronounced only in cases where the most depleted precipitation has a lower d excess does the monthly average based olsr result in a larger slope than the pwrma e g qitai jinghe kuytun fig 5 conversely as expected where the most enriched precipitation has a low d excess the pwrma results in the higher slope e g turpan luntai aksu fig 5 in both extremes there is a strong case for balancing the influence of these extremes based on their amount generally we would expect that removing heavy precipitation events would reduce the lmwl slope especially for the weighted methods as stated in previous studies hughes and crawford 2012 crawford et al 2014 the primary purpose to use the weighted method is to ensure heavy precipitation events influence the lmwl in proportion to their hydrological importance however in this region heavy precipitation events are infrequent and the influence of heavy precipitation especially 20 mm is relatively limited the precipitation extremes do exist but the frequency is actually very low although the frequency of occurrence has increased to some extent in recent decades wang et al 2013a b in contrast the influence of low precipitation events on lmwl is significant in arid central asia the rain events with amount 5 mm play a dominant role if we remove some small rain events a great variability in lmwl parameters can be seen compared with the weighted regression using precipitation amount the unweighted regression especially olsr is more sensitive to the small precipitation events if an amount weighted regression is considered for an event based data series which method is more robust or recommended the rmsseav statistic cannot be used to compare precipitation weighted with non weighted regressions only within the weighted or non weighted groups based on this statistical indicator generally pwlsr would be considered the most robust among the precipitation weighted methods and rma amongst the non weighted methods however as discussed by crawford et al 2014 rma based regressions are mathematically the most appropriate because of their equal weighting of both δd and δ 18o as independent but related variables in the regression therefore pwrma should also be considered suitable ma pwma regressions also meet the criteria but crawford et al 2014 comment that these regressions are more sensitive to outliers and may lead to an unexpectedly high slope and therefore their use is not recommended 3 3 inter annual variability of lmwls as shown in fig 7 and wang et al 2016c and liu et al 2014 the seasonality of δ 18o in precipitation is seen in the urumqi wulumuqi gnip data fukang chnip data and current observations in arid central asia the seasonal variation of isotopic characteristics during our observation period is generally within the bounds of the long term gnip chnip data however in autumn and winter it is consistently more depleted than the average to have a comparison point for monthly and event based lmwls as well as the inter annual variation of lmwls the gnip chnip data for urumqi fukang were selected to remove the influence of seasonal bias the years with 2 months of missing data when monthly precipitation was 1 mm i e 1986 1987 1989 1991 1996 1997 2003 2005 2007 2009 were used to create a lmwl for each year fig 7 and tables s12 s14 in supplementary material in fig 8 and tables s12 s14 in supplementary material the olsr slope ranges between 7 06 1991 and 2003 and 8 90 2005 and the pwrma slope ranges from 6 60 2003 to 8 66 2005 in arid central asia stable isotopes in precipitation are mainly controlled by the temperature effect yao et al 2013 wang et al 2016c however we observe no significant correlations between lmwl slopes derived using olsr or pwrma and temperature or precipitation amount at annual or seasonal time scales the relatively larger lmwl slope in 1996 a olsr 8 30 and 2012 2013 a olsr 8 43 coincides with lower winter air temperatures in those years this is also seen to some extent in 1986 however in 1997 which also had low winter temperature the summer temperature was very high and total rainfall amount low and the lmwl slopes were low as our dataset is only for one 12 month period we have used the gnip station urumqi wulumuqi and the chnip station fukung to consider the level of inter annual variability the reason for the largest lmwl slope being found at urumqi for 2012 2013 should be considered is it possible that the sampling method for the gnip station may lead to some evaporative enrichment huang et al 2013 considered that possibility for data from a similar period from the changsha gnip station in china they observed a large difference between the summer but not winter lwml slope when comparing monthly gnip samples with their daily data the urumqi gnip data has a wide range of d excess values which show a weak negative correlation with δ 18o but none with precipitation amount however in the urumqi gnip dataset significantly lower d excess was seen in summer than winter on average whereas for this study the lower d excess was found in winter wang et al 2016c this may be considered to support the possibility of sample evaporation in the gnip data influencing the lmwl slope in addition whilst sub cloud evaporation may lead to a decrease in d excess in more enriched samples as seen throughout the region at this site recycling of moisture from local irrigation water re evaporated under low humidity conditions contributes to a higher d excess during the growing season wang et al 2016c this will tend to increase the slope of the lmwl in comparison to other sites as observed in this study as an oasis city in an arid climate the contribution of recycled moisture to local rainfall cannot be ignored wang et al 2016a li et al 2016a b pang et al 2011 the recycled moisture contribution may also show a great change in the past decades because of the increasing irrigated agricultural area and urban green coverage irrigation water has been sourced through increasing utilization of montane runoff from the tianshan mountains and the completion of a scheme to bring water from the ertix irtysh river 400 km to the north between the gnip data period and this study for example the cropland area mostly irrigable land in xinjiang has enlarged from 2 8 104 km2 in 1985 to 3 4 104 km2 in 2000 and then to 6 1 104 km2 in 2015 and the urban green coverage has increased from 17 3 in 1985 to 29 1 in 2000 and then to 37 9 in 2015 qiu 2005 sbxuar 2016 some recent meteorological studies hua et al 2016 li et al 2018 based on reanalysis database also showed that in arid central asia the proportional contribution of recycled moisture has increased during past decades for this reason the possibility that there has been a shift in the lmwl should also be considered 4 concluding remarks in this study the spatial pattern of the local meteoric water line and its controlling factors was analyzed using an observation network in arid central asia the northern slope and mountains with relatively low temperature and higher precipitation have lmwls that are relatively close to the global average and the southern slopes with relatively high temperature and limited precipitation have lower lmwl slope and intercept generally this study has found that use of precipitation weighting is important in arid areas lwmls derived using a weighted regression especially pwrma with event based data are generally consistent with applying olsr to monthly data however this is less true for the more arid sites where low event numbers mean that aggregation into monthly composites does not provide effective precipitation weighting pwrma is considered a more mathematically sound method for determining the lmwl than pwlsr and for this reason we recommend its use in this region and other arid and semi arid regions the lmwls derived in this paper are based on a single year and we have found that inter annual variability of lmwl is small but not insignificant particularly where rainfall is scarce in addition changes in regional global climate as well as changes in landuse and local water storage and recycling can result in gradual modification of lmwls so a presumption that lmwls from old data represent current conditions may not be valid in circumstances where only short term datasets are available there is a benefit to be gained by using event data rather than monthly data a precipitation weighted regression using event based data can provide a wider range of values to constrain the regression than using a small number of monthly data point however the importance of capturing complete seasonal cycles still remains therefore lwml regressions should only be applied to multiples of complete 12 month periods

7233,the local meteoric water line lmwl reflects the relationship between stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation and is usually calculated using an ordinary least squares regression olsr when event based data are used to calculate a lmwl the differences in precipitation amount of samples are not considered using olsr which in turn may influence the representativeness of the lmwl for local hydrology small rain events occur widely in arid central asia annual mean precipitation 150 mm and where smaller precipitation has lower deuterium excess this results in lmwls with slopes and intercepts lower than the global average based on an observation network of isotopes in precipitation across the tianshan mountains in arid central asia lmwls for 23 stations are calculated from event based data from 2012 to 2013 n 978 using ordinary least squares reduced major axis and major axis regressions and their precipitation weighted counterparts for the northern slope and mountainous areas the lmwl slope and intercept are close to the global meteoric water line gmwl but the slope and intercept are lower for the southern slope indicating the greater dominance of sub cloud evaporation the effect of moisture recycling in the irrigated areas on the northern slope also can be seen where the lmwl slopes are 8 using a precipitation weighted regression method with event based data especially precipitation weighted reduced major axis regression pwrma is generally consistent with the olsr regression using monthly data however event based datasets provide a wider range of values to better constrain the regression than can be achieved using monthly data over a short period providing a sounder basis for determining lmwls for relatively short term sampling campaigns in an arid setting the use of the pwrma regression is preferred for determining the lmwl for the tianshan mountains and results in a regional meteoric water line of δd 7 9δ 18o 10 16 keywords stable isotope local meteoric water line arid central asia precipitation weighted regression 1 introduction the stable isotopes of hydrogen δd and oxygen δ 18o in precipitation have been widely applied in studies of hydrological processes e g aggarwal et al 2016 sprenger et al 2016 zhang and wang 2016 fischer et al 2017 and the relationship between δd and δ 18o in precipitation underpins many studies using isotopic approaches a strong linear relationship between δd and δ 18o in natural water was noticed in the mid 20th century friedman 1953 based on approximately 400 samples 40 from north america and the rest distributed across the world the best fit line of δd δ 18o δd 8δ 18o 10 was presented by craig 1961 and was later named the global meteoric water line gmwl with the establishment of the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip iaea wmo 2017 the gmwl was updated using longer time series and more stations worldwide e g yurtsever and gat 1981 rozanski et al 1993 gourcy et al 2005 which confirmed that δd 8δ 18o 10 was still a good approximation for the gmwl the equation relating δd to δ 18o at a site is defined as a local meteoric water line lmwl and can provide a reference point for interpretation of stable isotopic compositions of a range of water samples in an area influenced by many geographic and meteorological factors the slopes and intercepts of lmwls vary depending on location the comparison of the lmwl and gmwl can be used to assess moisture sources and precipitation processes and may indicate the degree of sub cloud evaporation or the contribution of re evaporated moisture to precipitation at a site an ordinary least squares regression olsr is widely used to determine the lmwl and this regression method logically gives all data points equal weighting iaea 1992 hughes and crawford 2012 regarding the data used to calculate the regression three options are commonly considered 1 use each month of data or each sample for event based sampling 2 use the precipitation amount weighted average δ 18o and δ 2h values for each month n 12 and 3 use annual precipitation amount weighted averages of δ 18o and δ 2h n years of record to reduce the influence of precipitation amount on lmwl monthly and annual weighted values have been recommended by the iaea 1992 the method of pooling all samples in one month and measuring the composite as is generally done for gnip stations does in fact partly weight the data for the size of events particularly where rainfall occurs frequently the isotopic composition of event based samples can provide detailed information about water processes especially the short term water vapor transport and rainout e g risi et al 2008 baldini et al 2010 crawford et al 2013 during recent years stable isotopes in event based precipitation have been widely investigated often based on sampling durations of approximately one or two years the relatively short duration of studies may increase the uncertainty of lmwls determined using event based samples impacted by secondary evaporation of falling raindrops in the atmosphere the equations relating δd to δ 18o for smaller amount events usually show lower slopes and intercepts peng et al 2007 and light precipitation events usually have a relatively enriched δ 18o dansgaard 1964 bony et al 2008 and low deuterium excess d excess defined as d δd 8δ 18o liu et al 2008 wu et al 2015 in some studies the smaller precipitation samples are even totally excluded in calculation e g harvey 2001 hughes and crawford 2013 small rain events which occur widely in arid and semi arid regions fu et al 2008 liu et al 2011 may therefore influence the representativeness of a lmwl for local conditions in studies of major flow processes and water storage heavy rainfall events normally play a dominant role and applying equal weights to each sample may lead to a hydrologically unrepresentative result alternative methods including precipitation weighted approaches are therefore valuable in determining lmwls especially in arid climates hughes and crawford 2012 crawford et al 2014 besides olsr a reduced major axis least squares regression rma was introduced by iaea 1992 and is suitable for the constant ratio of y and x value standard deviations an error in variables generalized least squared regression genls was presented by argiriou and lykoudis 2006 and allowed the errors of variables to be non constant and instead incorporate the measurement uncertainties hughes and crawford 2012 introduced the use of precipitation weighted least squares regression pwlsr which can reduce the biases of small rainfall events to increase the usefulness for groundwater and surface hydrology applications crawford et al 2014 then introduced two additional precipitation weighted regressions to determine lmwl and made a comparison between these and non weighted regressions using gnip data all regressions result in a similar fit if a strong linear relationship exists but the difference in fit is significant for some coastal and oceanic sites with a poor linear relationship between δd and δ 18o even though monthly precipitation weighted values were used in the current version of iaea international atomic energy agency water isotope system for data analysis iaea wmo 2017 three types of lmwl are available for each gnip station including olsr rma and pwlsr the arid region of central asia lies at the inland of the eurasian continent where marine moisture from surrounding oceans rarely reaches fig 1 the westerlies and polar vapor are usually considered as the dominant precipitation sources araguás araguás et al 1998 tian et al 2007 wang et al 2017 yao et al 2013 zhang and wang 2018 regional mean precipitation in arid central asia is 150 mm per year chen 2012 ranging from 10 mm at some desert basins to 500 mm at some mountainous sites the tianshan mountains also known as tien shan spanning multiple countries are the main mountain ranges in arid central asia a series of oases are distributed along the northern and southern slopes of the tianshan mountains and many low lying deserts such as the taklimakan and gurbantunggut deserts lie near the mountains the oasis belt is also called the tianshan corridor and is a vital section of the ancient silk road in such an arid region the local meteoric water line is an important reference in hydrological studies and development of a meteoric water line using limited precipitation samples needs to be carefully considered oberhänsli et al 2009 huang and pang 2010 however across the tianshan mountains the only existing lmwls are for several closely located sites near urumqi pang et al 2011 liu et al 2014 and for the whole region wang et al 2016c in this study lmwls for 23 sampling stations covering 500 000 km2 across the tianshan mountains china are presented using multiple regressions although the observation period is still relatively short the network provides a platform to understand the spatial pattern of lmwl in addition the differences between precipitation weighted and unweighted regressions are considered and meteorological controls on lmwls are discussed 2 data and methods 2 1 observation network according to the physico geographic regionalization of arid land in china chen 2010 there are five natural areas across this region fig 1 and table 1 1 the junggar basin desert area this area generally lies at the northern slope of the tianshan mountains and many small inland rivers flow to the northern desert due to the moisture path of westerlies the precipitation amount for the western portion is larger than that for the eastern portion 2 the ili bayanbulak mountain area this area generally consists of a westward river valley at the western portion ili and a high altitude basin at the eastern portion bayanbulak for the ili portion the topography of westward valley captures plenty of westerly moisture and leads to a relatively humid climate and a westward ili river flowing to the balkhash lake for the bayanbulak portion a vast wetland is located at the center and the river flows to the southern desert 3 the tarim basin desert area this area lies at the southern slope of the tianshan mountains and the climate is more arid than that in the northern slope due to the rain shadow effect of surrounding high mountains i e the tianshan mountains and the tibetan plateau the inland rivers originating from the mountains flow to the southern desert 4 the turpan basin desert area the area is a very arid basin with minimum elevation of 154 m and lies at the southern slope of the eastern tianshan mountains china s long term meteorological record with the lowest mean precipitation amount 10 mm occurs for this area 5 the hami gobi desert area this area lies at the eastern extremity of the southern slope of the tianshan mountains and is at the western edge of the vast gobi desert in 2012 an integrated observation network of stable isotopes in precipitation was established across the tianshan mountains arid central asia wang et al 2016c in this network all the natural areas across the chinese tianshan mountains were well covered considering the climate type and observation network the neighboring hami gobi and turpan basin are combined in this study turpan hami under a typical continental climate air temperature in arid central asia shows a seasonal variation with warm wet summers and cold dry winters wang et al 2016c generally the annual mean temperatures fig 2 a of junggar and ili bayanbulak are lower than the other natural areas although the temperature in ili bayanbulak shows a wide spatial variability due to the complex topography in the mountains in fig 2b the precipitation amount in ili bayanbulak is usually larger than the other areas and the very limited precipitation is seen in turpan hami although some sites in tarim receive a similar magnitude of annual precipitation as junggar the regional mean precipitation amount in tarim is far less than that in junggar meteorological statistics during 1961 2005 shi et al 2008 indicate that the annual mean precipitation at the chinese tianshan mountains is 409 mm but the amounts for the junggar and tarim basins are 277 mm and 66 mm respectively in addition the difference between the long term climatological averages for annual air temperature and precipitation amount and the data from this study is also shown in fig 2 indicating a similar temperature for the different periods but with most sites having a higher than average precipitation during the study period the precipitation amount during 2012 2013 is 114 of long term average ranging from 76 to 144 except aksu 184 and shisanjianfang 31 and is 22 1 mm more than long term average ranging between 16 9 mm and 67 3 mm except akqi 105 6 mm the pearson correlation coefficients between the long term values and those of the current study were 0 99 0 97 and 0 95 for temperature precipitation amount and relative humidity respectively with a slope of 1 for the line of best fit between long term and study period temperature and relative humidity and 0 84 for precipitation this indicates that the sampling period was not atypical a more detailed comparison for each station is presented in wang et al 2016c from august 2012 to september 2013 a total of 1052 event based precipitation samples were collected at 23 stations wang et al 2016c the basic spatial pattern of stable isotope composition in precipitation across the network was analyzed in wang et al 2016c and some influencing factors including moisture recycling below cloud evaporation moisture trajectory and synoptic condition were discussed in recent studies e g wang et al 2016a b 2017 zhang and wang 2018 in this study a full year subset of the samples collected from september 2012 to august 2013 was used to calculate lmwls and data for a total of 978 samples out of 1052 were used representing a 12 month subset all the samples were collected manually as individual events by full time meteorological observers at each station to prevent evaporation rain samples were collected immediately after the end of rainfall and then stored in 60 ml hdpe high density polyethylene bottles with waterproof seals snow samples were melted at room temperature in a plastic bag before being bottled the precipitation amounts during the rain snow events were measured manually the other meteorological parameters including air temperature and relative humidity were recorded by automatic weather stations and then checked against manual observations the stable isotopic composition was analyzed using a liquid water isotope analyzer dlt 100 los gatos research inc at the stable isotope laboratory college of geography and environmental science northwest normal university every precipitation sample and isotopic standard was injected sequentially six times and the first two injections were discarded because of memory effects the measured results of isotopic compositions are expressed in delta notation δ value which is the deviation of the sample relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow the measurement precision σ was 0 6 for δd and 0 2 for δ 18o respectively a more detailed description of sampling and analysis is found in wang et al 2016c 2 2 gnip and chnip data to compare the isotopic compositions in precipitation during the sampling period and other years the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip data from urumqi gnip site 5182801 wulumuqi 87 37 e 43 47 n 918 m a s l iaea wmo 2017 and the chinese network of isotopes in precipitation chnip data from fukang 87 56 e 44 17 n 460 m a s l approximately 60 km to the north liu et al 2014 were used in the gnip database monthly isotopes in urumqi precipitation were measured for 131 months and mainly covered three periods i e 1986 1992 1995 1998 and 2001 2003 chnip data for fukang are available for 48 months 2005 2007 and 2009 2 3 lmwl methods ordinary least squares regression olsr is the most commonly used method in calculating a lmwl and gives equal weighting to each sample iaea 1992 besides olsr reduced major axis regression rma and major axis regression ma are two alternative regression methods without precipitation weighting iaea 1992 crawford et al 2014 consistent with olsr rma and ma the corresponding amount weighted regressions defined by hughes and crawford 2012 and crawford et al 2014 are precipitation weighted least squares regression pwlsr precipitation weighted reduced major axis regression pwrma and precipitation weighted major axis regression pwma respectively all six regressions are integrated in local meteoric water line freeware updated in november 2014 available at http openscience ansto gov au collection 879 and this program was applied to the samples in this study according to crawford et al 2014 the average value of root mean sum of squared error rmsseav may be used to judge the regression where a value of rmsseav close to 1 denotes a close fit the s tatistical significance is assessed using the t test in this study the program available at https www danielsoper com statcalc calculator aspx id 103 soper 2017 with method described in cohen et al 2003 was used to calculate the significance of the difference in slopes between two different subsets of the data using the same regression 3 results and discussion 3 1 weighted and non weighted lmwl results 3 1 1 spatial pattern of lmwl based on the 978 event based precipitation samples collected at 23 stations across the tianshan mountains meteoric water lines mwl were determined for each station and sub region using the six methods outlined above fig 3 and tables s1 s3 in supplementary material using the most common method olsr the mwl for the whole study area n 978 is δd 7 38 0 04 δ 18o 0 33 0 55 r 2 0 97 p 0 01 if pwrma is used the mwl is very close to the gmwl δd 7 90 0 04 δ 18o 10 16 0 50 for individual stations olsr slopes range between 6 26 0 33 luntai and 8 30 0 21 qitai and are somewhat lower for the southern slope than for the northern slope and mountains similar patterns can also be found for the intercepts of lmwls table s2 using the monthly precipitation weighted values from all sampling sites resulted in an olsr meteoric water line of δd 7 67 0 08 δ 18o 3 32 1 15 n 207 r 2 0 98 p 0 01 figs 4 and 5 and tables s4 s6 in supplementary material where both the slope and intercept were larger than those determined using olsr with all the event based data to understand the gap between event based and monthly data the lmwls were calculated using alternative approaches figs 4 and 5 and tables s1 s3 in general olsr rma ma pwlsr pwrma and pwma have an increasing trend in slope i e a olsr a rma a ma a pwlsr a pwrma a pwma for all the samples this order was also seen in all the natural areas for most stations the differences based on alternative regressions showed a trend consistent with the hypothesis that below cloud evaporation of small rainfall amounts influences the slope of the lmwl in most natural areas except turpan hami fig 4 the weighted lmwl slopes using event based data are closer to the olsr based lmwl slopes using monthly data compared with the unweighted lmwl slope in fig s1 the olsr slopes using monthly data are compared with alternative slopes using event based data for each station it is clear that the weighted methods using event based samples especially pwrma are generally consistent with the olsr method using monthly data the exception is turpan hami where using a monthly regression does not increase the slope relative to olsr on event based data this is because the very low rainfall amounts in this region table s6 mean that even when the data is aggregated to a monthly time step a low d excess signal can remain in this study we presented lmwls in arid central asia based on an observation network of 23 stations although the lmwl is widely used as a frame of reference in isotope hydrology the most commonly used lmwl in this region is based on gnip chnip stations similarly located to the north of tianshan mountains at urumqi and fukang generally both the olsr slope 7 67 and intercept 3 32 in this study region are much lower than the global meteoric water line δd 8δ 18o 10 craig 1961 because of its aridity the range of lmwls found in this region is not inconsistent with those found for fukang and urumqi by liu et al 2014 however the slope and intercept varies significantly over the region in a way that is not captured by previous work in central asia the meteorological parameters especially air temperature and precipitation amount vary depending on location leading to a complex spatial pattern of isotope composition and lmwl in precipitation the study region is divided into four natural areas and the spatial diversity in lmwl for each area reflects the different climate backgrounds in the northern slope and the mountainous region with relatively humid conditions and low temperature the lmwl slopes are always higher than those along the arid southern slope further analysis confirmed the meteorological controls on lmwl which were consistent with the spatial pattern the trend of lmwl with different meteorological conditions is similar to previous studies e g peng et al 2007 wu et al 2015 chen et al 2015 and is generally presumed to be influenced by below cloud evaporation for the northern slope and mountainous region the combined slope and intercept are close to the gmwl however along the southern slope the lmwl slopes are lower than the gwml indicating the greater dominance of sub cloud evaporation in this more arid sub region which is supported by our earlier simulation using a modified stewart model wang et al 2016b in contrast some of the northern slope sites have a higher lmwl slope reflecting the contribution of re evaporation from irrigated land and open water in summer wang et al 2016a 3 1 2 meteorological controls on lmwls the variations in lmwls derived using different regressions are clearly related to meteorological conditions for each station four meteorological parameters were considered in this study precipitation amount p air temperature t and relative humidity rh recorded during each precipitation event data from all sites were combined and each of the six lmwl regressions calculated for samples corresponding to each meteorological parameter range fig 6 and tables s7 s9 in supplementary material the linear relationship between each of these variables and the slope of the lmwl for any method is strong most precipitation events were small with 78 8 of samples 771 representing a precipitation amount 5 mm and 91 7 897 samples being 10 mm as shown in fig 6a lmwls based on lower precipitation amounts usually had lower slopes and larger slopes were seen when using samples with larger precipitation amounts in fig 6b the lmwl slope for events with air temperature 20 c was between 5 and 7 depending on the regression method and the slope for samples collected at 0 c was generally 8 the trends in lmwl intercept table s8 in supplementary material were generally similar as those of slopes higher slopes and intercepts were seen for the conditions of higher precipitation amount and relative humidity as well as lower air temperature generally for conditions under which sub cloud evaporation is more likely low precipitation amounts high temperature low relative humidity the slopes were smaller and a large variation was obtained using the different regression techniques 3 1 3 influence of heavy and small precipitation on lmwls the primary reason to use precipitation weighting is to ensure that heavier rainfall events influence the lmwl equation in proportion to their hydrological importance to evaluate the importance of this across the tianshan mountains region we calculated lmwls after removing the heavy precipitation in stages p 30 mm p 20 mm and p 10 mm table 2 and tables s10 and s11 in supplementary material across the entire study region the removal of precipitation 20 mm has a limited influence on lmwl slopes for any method for the unweighted regressions the difference in slope from removing precipitation 10 mm was close to zero for precipitation weighted regressions the change in slope was also small and generally only seen clearly for the p 10 mm subset the influence of small precipitation events on lmwls is also seen in table 2 compared with heavy precipitation the variations of lmwls when removing small precipitation 0 5 mm 1 mm or 5 mm are much larger this is to be expected given the lower d excess of many of these samples generally the removal of small precipitation may result in a larger lmwl slope and the difference in slope using the unweighted regressions is larger than that using the precipitation weighted regressions in effect the removal of small precipitation amounts may be considered an arbitrary alternative to precipitation weighting and for precipitation weighted regressions the effect of these small rainfall events is already minimized it is significant for many of the non weighted regressions but hardly at all for the weighted regressions proving that weighting really is effective at removing any bias due to sample amount the removal of rainfall of 1 mm or 5 mm is equivalent to precipitation weighting for each of the regressions the results when only those precipitation amounts of 5 mm were used indicate little difference in the slopes between the different regression techniques 3 2 necessity and potential application of weighted regressions a key question to consider is given the small difference statistically between weighted and non weighted regressions is it justified to use weighted regressions at all statistically one might say no however the effect of weighting is clearly increasing the slope in all cases and if we agree that the justification for weighting of removing a systematic bias in the regression is sound then this should be considered the standard rather than olsr in the past several years stable isotope compositions in precipitation on an event or synoptic scale have aroused great attention in china and other countries in many studies event based data over a relatively short period is used directly to determine a lmwl and for comparison with mwls using monthly gnip station data the potential influence of irregular sample frequency or short duration is not always considered because of the limited data availability interestingly in this study the precipitation weighted regressions using event based data were similar to unweighted lmwls using the monthly data except in the most arid turpan hami region this indicates that the influence of sample frequency should be carefully considered if we have only a short term event based precipitation isotope record spanning for example a year especially in an arid climate the weighted regression can be considered as a strong alternative in some locations where seasonal variations in precipitation isotope composition are small using event based data rather than monthly averages may allow the slope of the lmwl to be better defined by increasing the range of input values to the regression however in the tianshan mountains the large seasonal range in the monthly averages fig 4 in wang et al 2016c helps to constrain the slope of the regression which is why the effect of the amount weighting is less pronounced only in cases where the most depleted precipitation has a lower d excess does the monthly average based olsr result in a larger slope than the pwrma e g qitai jinghe kuytun fig 5 conversely as expected where the most enriched precipitation has a low d excess the pwrma results in the higher slope e g turpan luntai aksu fig 5 in both extremes there is a strong case for balancing the influence of these extremes based on their amount generally we would expect that removing heavy precipitation events would reduce the lmwl slope especially for the weighted methods as stated in previous studies hughes and crawford 2012 crawford et al 2014 the primary purpose to use the weighted method is to ensure heavy precipitation events influence the lmwl in proportion to their hydrological importance however in this region heavy precipitation events are infrequent and the influence of heavy precipitation especially 20 mm is relatively limited the precipitation extremes do exist but the frequency is actually very low although the frequency of occurrence has increased to some extent in recent decades wang et al 2013a b in contrast the influence of low precipitation events on lmwl is significant in arid central asia the rain events with amount 5 mm play a dominant role if we remove some small rain events a great variability in lmwl parameters can be seen compared with the weighted regression using precipitation amount the unweighted regression especially olsr is more sensitive to the small precipitation events if an amount weighted regression is considered for an event based data series which method is more robust or recommended the rmsseav statistic cannot be used to compare precipitation weighted with non weighted regressions only within the weighted or non weighted groups based on this statistical indicator generally pwlsr would be considered the most robust among the precipitation weighted methods and rma amongst the non weighted methods however as discussed by crawford et al 2014 rma based regressions are mathematically the most appropriate because of their equal weighting of both δd and δ 18o as independent but related variables in the regression therefore pwrma should also be considered suitable ma pwma regressions also meet the criteria but crawford et al 2014 comment that these regressions are more sensitive to outliers and may lead to an unexpectedly high slope and therefore their use is not recommended 3 3 inter annual variability of lmwls as shown in fig 7 and wang et al 2016c and liu et al 2014 the seasonality of δ 18o in precipitation is seen in the urumqi wulumuqi gnip data fukang chnip data and current observations in arid central asia the seasonal variation of isotopic characteristics during our observation period is generally within the bounds of the long term gnip chnip data however in autumn and winter it is consistently more depleted than the average to have a comparison point for monthly and event based lmwls as well as the inter annual variation of lmwls the gnip chnip data for urumqi fukang were selected to remove the influence of seasonal bias the years with 2 months of missing data when monthly precipitation was 1 mm i e 1986 1987 1989 1991 1996 1997 2003 2005 2007 2009 were used to create a lmwl for each year fig 7 and tables s12 s14 in supplementary material in fig 8 and tables s12 s14 in supplementary material the olsr slope ranges between 7 06 1991 and 2003 and 8 90 2005 and the pwrma slope ranges from 6 60 2003 to 8 66 2005 in arid central asia stable isotopes in precipitation are mainly controlled by the temperature effect yao et al 2013 wang et al 2016c however we observe no significant correlations between lmwl slopes derived using olsr or pwrma and temperature or precipitation amount at annual or seasonal time scales the relatively larger lmwl slope in 1996 a olsr 8 30 and 2012 2013 a olsr 8 43 coincides with lower winter air temperatures in those years this is also seen to some extent in 1986 however in 1997 which also had low winter temperature the summer temperature was very high and total rainfall amount low and the lmwl slopes were low as our dataset is only for one 12 month period we have used the gnip station urumqi wulumuqi and the chnip station fukung to consider the level of inter annual variability the reason for the largest lmwl slope being found at urumqi for 2012 2013 should be considered is it possible that the sampling method for the gnip station may lead to some evaporative enrichment huang et al 2013 considered that possibility for data from a similar period from the changsha gnip station in china they observed a large difference between the summer but not winter lwml slope when comparing monthly gnip samples with their daily data the urumqi gnip data has a wide range of d excess values which show a weak negative correlation with δ 18o but none with precipitation amount however in the urumqi gnip dataset significantly lower d excess was seen in summer than winter on average whereas for this study the lower d excess was found in winter wang et al 2016c this may be considered to support the possibility of sample evaporation in the gnip data influencing the lmwl slope in addition whilst sub cloud evaporation may lead to a decrease in d excess in more enriched samples as seen throughout the region at this site recycling of moisture from local irrigation water re evaporated under low humidity conditions contributes to a higher d excess during the growing season wang et al 2016c this will tend to increase the slope of the lmwl in comparison to other sites as observed in this study as an oasis city in an arid climate the contribution of recycled moisture to local rainfall cannot be ignored wang et al 2016a li et al 2016a b pang et al 2011 the recycled moisture contribution may also show a great change in the past decades because of the increasing irrigated agricultural area and urban green coverage irrigation water has been sourced through increasing utilization of montane runoff from the tianshan mountains and the completion of a scheme to bring water from the ertix irtysh river 400 km to the north between the gnip data period and this study for example the cropland area mostly irrigable land in xinjiang has enlarged from 2 8 104 km2 in 1985 to 3 4 104 km2 in 2000 and then to 6 1 104 km2 in 2015 and the urban green coverage has increased from 17 3 in 1985 to 29 1 in 2000 and then to 37 9 in 2015 qiu 2005 sbxuar 2016 some recent meteorological studies hua et al 2016 li et al 2018 based on reanalysis database also showed that in arid central asia the proportional contribution of recycled moisture has increased during past decades for this reason the possibility that there has been a shift in the lmwl should also be considered 4 concluding remarks in this study the spatial pattern of the local meteoric water line and its controlling factors was analyzed using an observation network in arid central asia the northern slope and mountains with relatively low temperature and higher precipitation have lmwls that are relatively close to the global average and the southern slopes with relatively high temperature and limited precipitation have lower lmwl slope and intercept generally this study has found that use of precipitation weighting is important in arid areas lwmls derived using a weighted regression especially pwrma with event based data are generally consistent with applying olsr to monthly data however this is less true for the more arid sites where low event numbers mean that aggregation into monthly composites does not provide effective precipitation weighting pwrma is considered a more mathematically sound method for determining the lmwl than pwlsr and for this reason we recommend its use in this region and other arid and semi arid regions the lmwls derived in this paper are based on a single year and we have found that inter annual variability of lmwl is small but not insignificant particularly where rainfall is scarce in addition changes in regional global climate as well as changes in landuse and local water storage and recycling can result in gradual modification of lmwls so a presumption that lmwls from old data represent current conditions may not be valid in circumstances where only short term datasets are available there is a benefit to be gained by using event data rather than monthly data a precipitation weighted regression using event based data can provide a wider range of values to constrain the regression than using a small number of monthly data point however the importance of capturing complete seasonal cycles still remains therefore lwml regressions should only be applied to multiples of complete 12 month periods

7234,chaos theory is integrated with multi gene genetic programming mggp engine as a new hybrid model for river flow forecasting this is to be referred to as chaos mggp and its performance is tested using daily historic flow time series at four gauging stations in two countries with a mix of both intermittent and perennial rivers three models are developed i local prediction model lpm ii standalone mggp and iii chaos mggp where the first two models serve as the benchmark for comparison purposes the phase space reconstruction psr parameters of delay time and embedding dimension form the dominant input signals derived from original time series using chaos theory and these are transferred to chaos mggp the paper develops a procedure to identify global optimum values of the psr parameters for the construction of a regression type prediction model to implement the chaos mggp model the inter comparison of the results at the selected four gauging stations shows that the chaos mggp model provides more accurate forecasts than those of stand alone mggp or lpm models keywords chaos theory forecasting hybrid models multigene genetic programming mggp phase space reconstruction psr river flow 1 introduction integration of chaos theory with the artificial intelligence ai technique of multi gene genetic programming mggp is investigated in this paper by formulating a new hybrid model chaos theory emerged since the 1960s but evolutionary models such as mggp emerged since the work by rechenberg 1973 with a host of variations including genetic programming gp both chaos theory and gp have been applied widely including the prediction of river flow problems however there is no hybrid of these technique and hence the paper innovates by introducing a hybrid of chaos theory with mggp to be referred to as chaos mggp this model takes its basic phase space reconstruction psr parameters from chaos theory but its prediction algorithm is carried out by fitting a regression type equation to these dominant parameters for the prediction of river flows the paper devises a procedure to identify the global optimum values of psr parameters by using a variation of existing techniques the performance of chaos mggp is then compared with two benchmark models of i a model based on chaos theory and ii a standalone mggp model the three ai techniques employed in the paper are among a diversity of data driven models reported in the last few decades for studying river flow prediction these include among others artificial neural networks anns chen et al 2006 firat 2008 kişi

tongal 2013 wu and chau 2010 yaseen et al 2015 review comprehensively applications of some of these major data driven techniques in river flow prediction but the focus below is on chaos theory mggp and chaos mggp chaos theory represents a dynamic system by a set of effective variables represented in a phase space diagram so that each point on the diagram is a description of the system behaviour at a specific time a method for reconstructing phase space from an observed time series has been presented by takens 1981 psr can be used to extract the hidden characteristics and the information on dynamic systems from their time series it is an embedment of delay time that maps a signal into a sufficiently high dimension where embedment underlines an iteration process a structure is formed in the new high dimensional space which is topologically equivalent to the original phase space huang and hsieh 2012 this encourages spr applications to time series problems applications of chaos theory to data driven models are topical and have been successful in time series forecasts e g modelling and prediction of network traffic lin et al 2009 sea level sun et al 2010 evaporation baydaroǧlu and koçak 2014 and exchange rates huang et al 2010 mggp is a combination of gp and statistical regression methods and serves as a data driven technique since the original presentation of gp by koza 1992 its formulation has diversified which are outlined in the paper in due course including multi gene gp mggp see hinchliffe et al 1996 the state of the art on applying these techniques to river flow modelling is also successful and includes danandeh mehr et al 2014b 2013 danandeh mehr and demirel 2016 guven 2009 guven and aytek 2009 londhe and charhate 2010 makkeasorn et al 2008 savic et al 1999 shoaib et al 2015 wang et al 2009 whigham and crapper 2001 notably gp may produce misleading results if non stationary features and noise reduction are not carefully accounted for danandeh mehr and kahya 2017 nourani et al 2012 shoaib et al 2015 although this is similar to other data driven techniques gap analysis in the authors review on the application of gp to hydrological modelling indicates that the focus on drawbacks of standalone gp is sparse for example using the rainfall runoff time series in two small catchments nourani et al 2012 coupled discrete wavelet transform with standard gp and showed that the hybrid wavelet gp model performs better than standalone gp and ann a hybrid wavelet gep model was developed by shoaib et al 2015 and used for streamflow forecasting in four different catchments more recently ravansalar et al 2017 developed a hybrid wavelet lgp model wlgp to forecast monthly streamflow in two gauging stations using historical streamflow records and showed it to perform better than standalone lgp ann and the wavelet ann hybrid likewise the paper develops the new hybrid of chaos mggp and identifies its strength and weaknesses in due course this paper aims to address drawbacks of standalone gp based streamflow prediction models by innovating through a hybrid of chaos theory with mggp the concepts used from chaos theory include i phase space reconstruction ii mutual information function mif and iii false nearest neighbour fnn algorithm these concepts are linked as follows i chaos theory is used to identify the values of the psr parameters ii chaos mggp takes on board these parameters and builds appropriate equations to predict daily river flows for four gauging stations in iran and turkey although mggp has been recently introduced for river flow prediction the challenge in the paper is to produce a hybrid of chaos theory with mggp to improve their accuracy 2 methodology the transfer of parameters from chaos theory to mggp for the four test cases are taken through the following methodological procedures i detect existence of chaotic signals in the data ii use a procedure to derive the values of the parameters iii make forecasts for benchmarking by using local prediction model lpm and multi gene genetic programming mggp and iv investigate the performance of the hybrid of chaos theory with mggp chaos mggp and v compare the results of chaos mggp with the benchmarking models 2 1 phase space parameters delay time and embedding dimension schedule 1 chaotic behaviours reflect internal behaviours in the time history of one or more of system variables referred to as time series which may bear external signals for indicating their behaviours chaotic signals are a loss of temporal correlation in response to small perturbations particularly in initial conditions chaos theory applied over the years has created common knowledge that i the display of chaotic features in a time series is not apparent from their time plots ii some systems may display these features but some others may not and iii a range of mathematical techniques are used to avoid spurious results and to identify if the system behaviour is chaotic the paper uses the following nonlinear dynamic methods i phase space reconstruction ii mutual information function mif to identify the optimum delay time and iii false nearest neighbour fnn algorithm to identify the embedding dimension iv correlation dimension cd is used to check that chaotic signals satisfy certain conditions these are outlined next notably the paper describes three schedules for ascertaining the values of delay time and embedding dimensions 2 1 1 phase space reconstruction psr a chaotic system reveals a relatively complex behaviour through the dynamics of a nonlinear system the orbits of the system attract a complex higher dimensional subset called a strange attractor and they are important due to their widespread occurrences in the real world huang et al 2010 each dynamic system may be stochastic deterministic or chaotic which can be identified using the spr space concept psr is the basis for chaotic time series forecasts in which a univariate time series is reconstructed using all the variable information in the dynamic system contained in the univariate time series e g koçak et al 2004 every point in a phase space is a representation of a state of the system and every trajectory represents the time evolution of the system corresponding to different initial conditions points or a set of points in a phase space forming trajectories as attractors provide quantitative estimates of the complexity of a system through the properties of the attractor and also determine the nature of the observed dynamic behaviours for a one dimensional time series one way of reconstruction is through the takens delay embedding theorem takens 1981 according to which for a given a time series s t x 1 x 2 x 3 x n from a chaotic system it is possible to reconstruct a phase space in terms of the phase space vectors x t expressed as takens 1981 1 x t x t x t τ x t 2 τ x t m 1 τ t 1 2 m m n m 1 τ where m is the embedding dimension or dimension of phase space reconstruction τ is delay time and m is the number of phase points of reconstructed phase space phase space diagrams can give information about the dynamics of a system through their trajectory sivakumar and jayawardena 2002 when unfolded into the phase space the underlying structures in the chaotic time series can be visualised the input signals of the network can be selected as the components of the current phase space vectors i e x t x t τ x t 2 τ x t m 1 τ while keeping the future value x t t as the desired response given the time series s t an m dimensional psr can be extended as follows takens 1981 2 psr x 1 x 1 τ x 1 2 τ x 1 3 τ x 1 m 1 τ x 2 x 2 τ x 2 2 τ x 2 3 τ x 2 m 1 τ x n m x n m τ x n m 2 τ x n m 3 τ x n m m 1 τ an important step in reconstructing a suitable phase space is to select an optimum delay time τ and embedding dimension m the properties of this particular value of delay time is that at this point the values of x i and x i τ are sufficiently independent of each other to be useful as coordinates in a time delay vector but not so independent as to have no connection with each other at all 2 1 2 mutual information function mif mif also referred to as average mutual information is a frequently used tool to detect the identifiability of the optimum delay time for attractor reconstruction mif is selected as it is considered better than the other alternatives of autocorrelation function e g holzfuss and mayer kress 1986 which suits to linear properties and of correlation integral e g liebert and schuster 1989 which generally requires more data this study uses the first mif minimum i τ to determine τ as follows fraser and swinney 1986 3 i τ t 1 n τ p x t x t τ log p x t x t τ p x t p x t τ where p x n is the probability density of x n and the p x n x n τ is the joint probability density of x n and x n τ i τ is a measure of the statistical dependence of the reconstruction variables on each other if the reconstruction variables are statistically independent i τ 0 complete dependence results in i τ a suitable choice of delay time requires the mif to be minimum 2 1 3 false nearest neighbour fnn the fnn method proposed by kennel et al 1992 is used to detect the identifiability of the minimum sufficient embedding dimension m elshorbagy et al 2002 huang et al 2010 khatibi et al 2012 ng et al 2007 as the number of dominant variables for representing the system dynamics points of the trajectories on the attractor have neighbours in the phase space the behaviour of these neighbours provides valuable information to understand the evolution of neighbourhoods in order to produce equations for prediction abarbanel 1996 the idea of the fnn algorithm is as follows i for each point z i in the time series search for its nearest neighbour z j in an m dimensional space ii calculate the distance z i z j and iii iterate both points and compute 4 r i z i 1 z j 1 z i z j iv if r i exceeds a given heuristic threshold r t this point is marked as having a false nearest neighbour and v the embedding dimension should be high enough and this occurs when the fraction of points for which r i r t is zero or at least sufficiently small huang et al 2010 2 1 4 correlation dimensions to detect chaotic signals correlation dimension cd is a nonlinear measure of the correlation between pairs lying on the attractor and one of the most efficient methods to detect the presence of chaos this method is used as a fractal dimension quantifier and is based on the correlation integral grassberger and procaccia 1983 for an m dimensional phase space the correlation function cm r is given by theiler 1986 as 5 c m r lim n 2 n n 1 j 1 n h r yi yj where h is the heaviside step function with h u 1 for u 0 and h u 0 for u 0 and u r y i y j n is the number of points on the reconstructed attractor r is the radius of the sphere centred on y i or y j if the time series is characterised by an attractor then for positive values of r the correlation function c m r is related to the radius r for stochastic time series c m r r m is true whereas for chaotic time series the correlation function scales with r as 6 c m r r d where d is called the correlation exponent the correlation exponent is defined by 7 d lim r 0 ln cm r ln r and can reliably be estimated as the slope in ln c m r versus ln r plot the slope can be computed by the least squares fit of a straight line scaling region over a length scales of r 2 2 chaos based parameters and prediction model 2 2 1 local approximation prediction model lpm phase space reconstruction psr parameters are essential for the implementation of the local approximation prediction model lpm and the technique used by lpm is referred to in the paper is schedule 2 which is described in section 4 2 schedule 2 comprises the use of mif to identify the τ values and a trial and error procedure to estimate the m value psr parameters facilitate an interpretation of the underlying dynamics in the form of an m dimensional map f t expressed as 8 y j t f t y j where y j y j and y j t y j t are vectors of dimension m describing the state of the system at times j i e the current state and j t i e the future state respectively the problem then is to find an appropriate expression for f t i e f t local approximation entails the subdivision of the f t domain into many subsets neighbourhoods each of which identifies some approximations f t valid only in that same subset in other words the dynamics of the system is locally described step by step in the phase space in this m dimensional space prediction is performed by estimating the change of x i with time considering the relation between the points x t and x t p the behaviour at a future time p on the attractor is approximated by function f as 9 x t p f x t in this prediction method the change of x t with time on the attractor is assumed to be the same as those of nearby points x t h h 1 n herein x t p is determined by the dth order polynomial f x t as follows itoh 1995 10 x t p f 0 k 1 0 m 1 f 1 k 1 x t k 1 τ k 2 k 1 k 1 0 m 1 f 2 k 1 k 2 x t k τ 1 x t k 2 τ k d k d 1 k 2 k 1 k 1 0 m 1 f dk 1 k 2 k d x t k 1 τ x t k 2 τ x t k d τ using n of x t h and x t h p for which the values are already known the coefficients f are determined by the solution of the following equation 11 x a f where 12 x x t 1 p x t 2 p x t n p and 13 f f 0 f 1 0 f 1 1 f 1 m 1 f 2 00 f d m 1 m 1 m 1 and a is the n m d m d jacobian matrix which in its explicit form is 14 a 1 x t 1 x t 1 τ x t 1 m 1 τ x t 1 2 x t 1 m 1 τ d 1 x t 2 x t 2 τ x t 2 m 1 τ x t 2 2 x t 2 m 1 τ d 1 x t n x t n τ x t n m 1 τ x t n 2 x t n m 1 τ d in order to obtain a stable solution the number of rows in the jacobian matrix a must satisfy 15 n m d m d as stated by porporato and ridolfi 1997 even though f values are first degree polynomials the prediction is nonlinear because during the prediction procedure every point x t belongs to a different neighbourhood and is therefore defined by different expressions for f kocak 1997 2 2 2 selection of τ and m values three different schedules are available to estimate psr parameters τ and m values as follows schedule 1 relates to the techniques given in section 2 1 and comprises the use of mif to identify the optimum τ and fnn to that of the optimum m schedule 2 relates to the techniques outlined in section 2 2 1 and to be detailed in section 4 2 which comprises the use of mif to identify τ but use a trial and error procedure to estimate m schedule 3 is developed by the paper which seeks to minimise rmse between observed and the forecasts by searching the space of psr parameters for all values of τ 1 20 and m 1 100 this may be implemented in various ways and the schedule used by the paper is based on constructing an ann model for each value of delay time and embedding dimension thus schedule 3 ensures that the globally optimum values of psr parameters are passed to chaos mggp models 2 3 multi gene genetic programming mggp mggp is a variation of gp first suggested by hinchliffe et al 1998 similar to other gp variants these prediction problems are capable of a truly bottom up process for potentially not making any assumption on the structure of the relationship between independent and dependent variables the identification of the appropriate relationship is also part of the prediction problem mggp is an automatic programming technique and similar to gp builds up the model in terms of i terminals which are composed of values of constants and variables ii functions which comprise mathematical operators and iii these together form gene structures and a collection of genes form a chromosome for more details see searson 2015 mggp linearly combines low depth gp trees in order to improve fitness of traditional gp searson 2009 mggp is expected to provide simpler models than those of traditional monolithic gp for using smaller trees as per eq 16 in mggp the construction of the relationship between predictand y and predictors xi i e multigene program or model is made possible by linear summation of at least two straightforward genes i e n 2 plus a random constant b which is called bias 16 y b i 1 n a i f x i where the term a i f x i is weighted output of each genes computed by evolutionary processes the main evolutionary processes in mggp and similar other techniques are as follows crossover operations are responsible for maintaining identical features from one generation parents to another offspring mutation refers to a random change in each gene and the reproduction secures the survival of the better performing multigenes moving to the next generation directly the bias and weights i e regression coefficients can be determined by a goodness of fit measure like least squares procedure for each multigene model technical details on the mggp can be obtained from searson 2015 and danandeh mehr and nourani 2017 the modelling parameters adopted in this study for performing both the standalone mggp and hybrid chaos mggp are outlined in section 4 2 4 chaos mggp hybrid model as illustrated in fig 1 the paper develops a hybrid of chaos theory with mggp which involves the following main steps i schedule 3 is employed to identify the optimum delay time and embedding dimension of the target variable to reconstruct its phase space and this defines the model structure as appropriate to the chaos mggp hybrid model elaborated below ii the phase space signals together with original series are entered to the mggp engine to discover the relation between input and target variables notably dominant input signals series produced by schedule 3 are embedded in chaos mggp and this is similar to uyumaz et al 2014 2 5 model structure for mggp and chaos mggp the usual regressive type of model structure for forecasting is 17 y t f y t y t 1 y t i for mggp the model structure is simply expressed as 7 steps of delay times as follows 18 y t f y t y t 1 y t 2 y t 3 y t 4 y t 5 y t 6 mggp identifies automatically the dependence on the significance of the older delay times for chaos mggp this is set by the psr to illustrate both an example is presented in table 1 in which the time series is assumed to have 100 data points with the values of y 1 y 2 y 3 y 4 y 5 y 100 but the array of their predicted values is denoted by y 1 y 2 y 3 y 4 y 5 y 100 the example runs the risk of being too simple and of removing all the niceties but expresses the essential complexity more clearly for mggp there are 7 terms lagging the forecast value and for chaos mggp assume that τ 5 m 3 and therefore the model structure is as illustrated in table 1 3 physical systems and their data description 3 1 study area the models developed in this study are trained and validated by using case studies from four rivers of differing hydrological and hydrometric characters with flows of intermittent and perennial river types the investigation uses historical daily discharge as follows i a gauging station on eherchay aharchay a tributary of qarasu which flows to the river araz a basin of the caspian sea ii a gauging station on the river livan also written as lighvan a tributary of aji chay a basin of lake urmia iii the sogutluhan gauging station on kizilirmak iv and the yamula gauging station also on kizilirmak a basin of the black sea the names are presented in alphabetical orders the locations of these rivers are shown in fig 2 the first two of which are located in the east azerbaijan province northwest iran and the other two in the central anatolia turkey along kizilirmak which is the longest river in turkey and flows to the black sea data summary and availability in these stations are given in table 2 and the data record is displayed in fig 3 the mean values in table 2 suggest that perhaps the flow at livan maximum of 6 1 m3s 1 is likely to be of low magnitude to warrant any real dynamic effects however the data was not removed from this study purely on the basis of producing numerically plausible results 3 2 evaluation criteria the performance of the models is evaluated by goodness of fit measures using i and root mean squared error rmse and ii the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient the perfect fit model will have rmse value of 0 0 and nse of 1 the training datasets were chosen at 75 of the length of the time series and the testing datasets covered their remaining 25 4 results 4 1 detection of chaotic signals and psr parameters for schedule 1 the performance of the chaos mggp model for the prediction of daily river flows is the main focus of the paper but the key for this modelling strategy is the detection of chaotic signals in the data and this requires the construction of the phase space diagrams as shown in fig 4 the results for each station invoke visual evidence for existence of well defined attractors and justify the application of low dimensional chaos theory for the cases studies the detection of chaotic signals is further investigated by using the correlation dimension method through identifying whether or not the correlation exponent value can become saturated with the increased embedding dimension sivakumar and jayawardena 2002 fig 5 shows the relationship between the correlation integral c r and the radius r using eq 6 for m from 1 to 20 the figure provides evidence for a possible existence of chaos as all the curves pass through a saturation point schedule 1 results are presented in table 3 which gives the optimum delay time values derived by mif using eq 3 and embedding dimension by fnn using eq 4 for each observation station fig 6 presents the relationship between the correlation exponent values of d and values of m using eq 7 for the four stations according to the figure the correlation exponent value d increases with m up to a certain dimension beyond which it becomes saturated and this is an indication of existence of deterministic dynamics sivakumar and jayawardena 2002 the saturated correlation dimension shown in fig 6 is 2 5 the nearest integer above the saturation value provides the minimum dimension of the dynamic system islam and sivakumar 2002 and wang et al 2009 notably the correlation dimension analysis only provides information on the number of variables dominantly influencing the dynamics of the phenomenon but does not identify the variables islam and sivakumar 2002 for instance the correlation dimension of 2 5 indicates that at least 3 independent variables are needed to describe the dynamics of the river time series 4 2 local approximation prediction model and psr parameters by schedules 2 and 3 the local approximation prediction model lpm is used for predicting daily river flow time series from the four measurement stations lpm intrinsically contains schedule 2 for the identification of the psr parameters τ and m implemented through the following procedure i identify the τ values using mif ii vary m in a range say 1 12 iii for each value of m and estimate the value of nse and rmse and iv select the embedding dimension with the highest nse coefficient and lowest rmse and this will serve as the basis for the lpm solutions the m values are given in table 4 for the four gauging stations it shows that the best forecasts are achieved when the values of embedding dimension are m 12 for eherchay m 3 for livan river m 1 for the sogutluhan and m 8 for the yamula stations it is normal practice to use these values in the final implementation of lpm and its prediction results are discussed in section 5 4 3 values of τ and m for chaos mggp models the schedule 2 values of delay time τ and embedding dimension m are also presented in table 3 for comparison these values could have been transferred to chaos mggp models but to eliminate the risk of using local minima values schedule 3 is introduced which caters for the global optimum values by varying the values of m from 1 to 20 and τ from 1 to 100 in this way ann is used to generate 2000 prediction runs and estimating the performance measures of rmse and nse for each run their contours given in fig 7 identified the global optimum values of τ and m which are given in table 3 the figure shows that the landscape of τ m values have many local minima and therefore the procedure selected in this study for the deriving τ and m values for chaos mggp is logical 4 4 results of mggp and chaos mggp the procedure for preliminary preparations in any gp based modelling including both the mggp and chaos mggp runs is through the following steps i create an initial population of multigenes by specifying a primitive set of terminals in the form of predefined input variables for each station as well as functions and a set of random constants chosen in the range 1 0 and 1 0 as potential members of terminal sets ii define a fitness function to rank the initial population of multigenes and this is often rmse and referred to as the fitness function iii evolve new populations of multigenes using evolutionary operators of reproduction crossover and mutations iv rank each new population based on the fitness value of each multigene v repeat steps iii and iv terminate the run when reached either a predefined fitness value or maximum number of generations the functions for both mggp and chaos mggp models in this study are predefined by the following three basic arithmetic operations i e addition subtraction and multiplication to ensure that the fitted models are parsimonious normalised daily river flow observations at time t 1 are model outputs at each station predefined input variables for mggp models at each station are normalised daily river flow observations and their antecedent values back to optimum delay time for chaos mggp models in this study the phase space signals with different dimensions are considered as predefined input variables table 5 gives the default parameters for mggp and chaos mggp runs as selected in this study preliminary preparations of mggp and chaos mggp are similar but the model structure for chaos mggp is set by optimum values of m and τ as per table 3 the chaos mggp model uses the value of schedule 3 given in table 3 in which the m values are not necessarily the same as those identified by schedule 2 and used by lpm 5 discussion the paper produced three sets of phase space reconstruction psr parameters of delay time τ and embedding dimension m schedule 1 to schedule 3 the processing of delay time in schedules 1 and 2 is identical but schedule 3 confirms their results despite using a slightly different procedure however the embedding dimension among schedules 1 3 differ somewhat as they rely on different search algorithms for optimum values of psr parameters although schedule 3 renders globally optimum set of values it is rather computationally costly the results of performance measures of the three models lpm mggp and chaos mggp are given in table 6 according to which their performances are acceptable however the hybrid chaos mggp performs better than the two benchmark models of lpm and mggp also mggp performs slightly better than lpm in three test cases livan sogutluhan and yamula but lpm performs slightly better than mggp in one test case eherchay to understand comparative performances of these models their scatter diagrams are displayed in fig 8 for all the stations which shows less scatters with chaos mggp than lpm or mggp attention is given to the scatter of the residuals observed minus modelled values and the results are shown in fig 9 for the testing phase it provides evidence that i the scatters associated with the chaos mggp model are significantly narrower than those for the other two models ii the difference between lpm and mggp is marginal and as discussed above they have a mixed fortune i e in one case lpm performs better than mggp but mggp performs better than lpm in the other three cases see table 6 iii the residuals are distributed randomly and there is no trend suggested by these results and iv at extreme residuals reliabilities of predicted results are poor for the

6 conclusions a new data driven model is developed and tested in this paper which integrates multigene genetic programming mggp with chaos theory to be referred to as chaos mggp river flow records from four gauging stations two stations on intermittent streams and two stations on perennial rivers were used to train and test the chaos mggp model the original river flow observation time series were transformed into multi dimension phase spaces and the subsequent analysis by the various techniques of chaos theory demonstrated existence of the dynamics of chaotic behaviour in the data the optimum values of phase space reconstruction psr parameters delay time τ and embedding dimension m were obtained by three schedules schedule 1 uses mutual information function mif to identify delay time and false nearest neighbour fnn to identify embedding dimension schedule 2 uses the procedure intrinsic in lpm by replacing fnn with a trial and error procedure and iii schedule 3 seeks the global optimum values of psr parameters in the landscape of τ m values the results show that psr is able to capture the essential dynamics of chaotic system existing in river flow series through the parameters of delay time and embedding dimension the paper presents the results of three models constructed for the four datasets lpm mggp and chaos mggp the performances of these models are compared at each station in terms of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and root mean square errors rmse measures the performance measures reveal that the chaos mggp model provides significant improvements over the two benchmark models of using local approximation prediction model lpm and the standalone mggp whereas these benchmark models are still fit for purpose and there is not much to choose between their performances the authors have also integrated psr parameters with regression equations and hybrid also suggestive of significant improvements and are planning to test hybrids with other modelling strategies however the improvements by chaos mggp is based on using schedule 3 for psr parameters which are computationally costly abarbanel 1996 h d i abarbanel analysis of observed chaotic data 1996

7234,chaos theory is integrated with multi gene genetic programming mggp engine as a new hybrid model for river flow forecasting this is to be referred to as chaos mggp and its performance is tested using daily historic flow time series at four gauging stations in two countries with a mix of both intermittent and perennial rivers three models are developed i local prediction model lpm ii standalone mggp and iii chaos mggp where the first two models serve as the benchmark for comparison purposes the phase space reconstruction psr parameters of delay time and embedding dimension form the dominant input signals derived from original time series using chaos theory and these are transferred to chaos mggp the paper develops a procedure to identify global optimum values of the psr parameters for the construction of a regression type prediction model to implement the chaos mggp model the inter comparison of the results at the selected four gauging stations shows that the chaos mggp model provides more accurate forecasts than those of stand alone mggp or lpm models keywords chaos theory forecasting hybrid models multigene genetic programming mggp phase space reconstruction psr river flow 1 introduction integration of chaos theory with the artificial intelligence ai technique of multi gene genetic programming mggp is investigated in this paper by formulating a new hybrid model chaos theory emerged since the 1960s but evolutionary models such as mggp emerged since the work by rechenberg 1973 with a host of variations including genetic programming gp both chaos theory and gp have been applied widely including the prediction of river flow problems however there is no hybrid of these technique and hence the paper innovates by introducing a hybrid of chaos theory with mggp to be referred to as chaos mggp this model takes its basic phase space reconstruction psr parameters from chaos theory but its prediction algorithm is carried out by fitting a regression type equation to these dominant parameters for the prediction of river flows the paper devises a procedure to identify the global optimum values of psr parameters by using a variation of existing techniques the performance of chaos mggp is then compared with two benchmark models of i a model based on chaos theory and ii a standalone mggp model the three ai techniques employed in the paper are among a diversity of data driven models reported in the last few decades for studying river flow prediction these include among others artificial neural networks anns chen et al 2006 firat 2008 kişi

tongal 2013 wu and chau 2010 yaseen et al 2015 review comprehensively applications of some of these major data driven techniques in river flow prediction but the focus below is on chaos theory mggp and chaos mggp chaos theory represents a dynamic system by a set of effective variables represented in a phase space diagram so that each point on the diagram is a description of the system behaviour at a specific time a method for reconstructing phase space from an observed time series has been presented by takens 1981 psr can be used to extract the hidden characteristics and the information on dynamic systems from their time series it is an embedment of delay time that maps a signal into a sufficiently high dimension where embedment underlines an iteration process a structure is formed in the new high dimensional space which is topologically equivalent to the original phase space huang and hsieh 2012 this encourages spr applications to time series problems applications of chaos theory to data driven models are topical and have been successful in time series forecasts e g modelling and prediction of network traffic lin et al 2009 sea level sun et al 2010 evaporation baydaroǧlu and koçak 2014 and exchange rates huang et al 2010 mggp is a combination of gp and statistical regression methods and serves as a data driven technique since the original presentation of gp by koza 1992 its formulation has diversified which are outlined in the paper in due course including multi gene gp mggp see hinchliffe et al 1996 the state of the art on applying these techniques to river flow modelling is also successful and includes danandeh mehr et al 2014b 2013 danandeh mehr and demirel 2016 guven 2009 guven and aytek 2009 londhe and charhate 2010 makkeasorn et al 2008 savic et al 1999 shoaib et al 2015 wang et al 2009 whigham and crapper 2001 notably gp may produce misleading results if non stationary features and noise reduction are not carefully accounted for danandeh mehr and kahya 2017 nourani et al 2012 shoaib et al 2015 although this is similar to other data driven techniques gap analysis in the authors review on the application of gp to hydrological modelling indicates that the focus on drawbacks of standalone gp is sparse for example using the rainfall runoff time series in two small catchments nourani et al 2012 coupled discrete wavelet transform with standard gp and showed that the hybrid wavelet gp model performs better than standalone gp and ann a hybrid wavelet gep model was developed by shoaib et al 2015 and used for streamflow forecasting in four different catchments more recently ravansalar et al 2017 developed a hybrid wavelet lgp model wlgp to forecast monthly streamflow in two gauging stations using historical streamflow records and showed it to perform better than standalone lgp ann and the wavelet ann hybrid likewise the paper develops the new hybrid of chaos mggp and identifies its strength and weaknesses in due course this paper aims to address drawbacks of standalone gp based streamflow prediction models by innovating through a hybrid of chaos theory with mggp the concepts used from chaos theory include i phase space reconstruction ii mutual information function mif and iii false nearest neighbour fnn algorithm these concepts are linked as follows i chaos theory is used to identify the values of the psr parameters ii chaos mggp takes on board these parameters and builds appropriate equations to predict daily river flows for four gauging stations in iran and turkey although mggp has been recently introduced for river flow prediction the challenge in the paper is to produce a hybrid of chaos theory with mggp to improve their accuracy 2 methodology the transfer of parameters from chaos theory to mggp for the four test cases are taken through the following methodological procedures i detect existence of chaotic signals in the data ii use a procedure to derive the values of the parameters iii make forecasts for benchmarking by using local prediction model lpm and multi gene genetic programming mggp and iv investigate the performance of the hybrid of chaos theory with mggp chaos mggp and v compare the results of chaos mggp with the benchmarking models 2 1 phase space parameters delay time and embedding dimension schedule 1 chaotic behaviours reflect internal behaviours in the time history of one or more of system variables referred to as time series which may bear external signals for indicating their behaviours chaotic signals are a loss of temporal correlation in response to small perturbations particularly in initial conditions chaos theory applied over the years has created common knowledge that i the display of chaotic features in a time series is not apparent from their time plots ii some systems may display these features but some others may not and iii a range of mathematical techniques are used to avoid spurious results and to identify if the system behaviour is chaotic the paper uses the following nonlinear dynamic methods i phase space reconstruction ii mutual information function mif to identify the optimum delay time and iii false nearest neighbour fnn algorithm to identify the embedding dimension iv correlation dimension cd is used to check that chaotic signals satisfy certain conditions these are outlined next notably the paper describes three schedules for ascertaining the values of delay time and embedding dimensions 2 1 1 phase space reconstruction psr a chaotic system reveals a relatively complex behaviour through the dynamics of a nonlinear system the orbits of the system attract a complex higher dimensional subset called a strange attractor and they are important due to their widespread occurrences in the real world huang et al 2010 each dynamic system may be stochastic deterministic or chaotic which can be identified using the spr space concept psr is the basis for chaotic time series forecasts in which a univariate time series is reconstructed using all the variable information in the dynamic system contained in the univariate time series e g koçak et al 2004 every point in a phase space is a representation of a state of the system and every trajectory represents the time evolution of the system corresponding to different initial conditions points or a set of points in a phase space forming trajectories as attractors provide quantitative estimates of the complexity of a system through the properties of the attractor and also determine the nature of the observed dynamic behaviours for a one dimensional time series one way of reconstruction is through the takens delay embedding theorem takens 1981 according to which for a given a time series s t x 1 x 2 x 3 x n from a chaotic system it is possible to reconstruct a phase space in terms of the phase space vectors x t expressed as takens 1981 1 x t x t x t τ x t 2 τ x t m 1 τ t 1 2 m m n m 1 τ where m is the embedding dimension or dimension of phase space reconstruction τ is delay time and m is the number of phase points of reconstructed phase space phase space diagrams can give information about the dynamics of a system through their trajectory sivakumar and jayawardena 2002 when unfolded into the phase space the underlying structures in the chaotic time series can be visualised the input signals of the network can be selected as the components of the current phase space vectors i e x t x t τ x t 2 τ x t m 1 τ while keeping the future value x t t as the desired response given the time series s t an m dimensional psr can be extended as follows takens 1981 2 psr x 1 x 1 τ x 1 2 τ x 1 3 τ x 1 m 1 τ x 2 x 2 τ x 2 2 τ x 2 3 τ x 2 m 1 τ x n m x n m τ x n m 2 τ x n m 3 τ x n m m 1 τ an important step in reconstructing a suitable phase space is to select an optimum delay time τ and embedding dimension m the properties of this particular value of delay time is that at this point the values of x i and x i τ are sufficiently independent of each other to be useful as coordinates in a time delay vector but not so independent as to have no connection with each other at all 2 1 2 mutual information function mif mif also referred to as average mutual information is a frequently used tool to detect the identifiability of the optimum delay time for attractor reconstruction mif is selected as it is considered better than the other alternatives of autocorrelation function e g holzfuss and mayer kress 1986 which suits to linear properties and of correlation integral e g liebert and schuster 1989 which generally requires more data this study uses the first mif minimum i τ to determine τ as follows fraser and swinney 1986 3 i τ t 1 n τ p x t x t τ log p x t x t τ p x t p x t τ where p x n is the probability density of x n and the p x n x n τ is the joint probability density of x n and x n τ i τ is a measure of the statistical dependence of the reconstruction variables on each other if the reconstruction variables are statistically independent i τ 0 complete dependence results in i τ a suitable choice of delay time requires the mif to be minimum 2 1 3 false nearest neighbour fnn the fnn method proposed by kennel et al 1992 is used to detect the identifiability of the minimum sufficient embedding dimension m elshorbagy et al 2002 huang et al 2010 khatibi et al 2012 ng et al 2007 as the number of dominant variables for representing the system dynamics points of the trajectories on the attractor have neighbours in the phase space the behaviour of these neighbours provides valuable information to understand the evolution of neighbourhoods in order to produce equations for prediction abarbanel 1996 the idea of the fnn algorithm is as follows i for each point z i in the time series search for its nearest neighbour z j in an m dimensional space ii calculate the distance z i z j and iii iterate both points and compute 4 r i z i 1 z j 1 z i z j iv if r i exceeds a given heuristic threshold r t this point is marked as having a false nearest neighbour and v the embedding dimension should be high enough and this occurs when the fraction of points for which r i r t is zero or at least sufficiently small huang et al 2010 2 1 4 correlation dimensions to detect chaotic signals correlation dimension cd is a nonlinear measure of the correlation between pairs lying on the attractor and one of the most efficient methods to detect the presence of chaos this method is used as a fractal dimension quantifier and is based on the correlation integral grassberger and procaccia 1983 for an m dimensional phase space the correlation function cm r is given by theiler 1986 as 5 c m r lim n 2 n n 1 j 1 n h r yi yj where h is the heaviside step function with h u 1 for u 0 and h u 0 for u 0 and u r y i y j n is the number of points on the reconstructed attractor r is the radius of the sphere centred on y i or y j if the time series is characterised by an attractor then for positive values of r the correlation function c m r is related to the radius r for stochastic time series c m r r m is true whereas for chaotic time series the correlation function scales with r as 6 c m r r d where d is called the correlation exponent the correlation exponent is defined by 7 d lim r 0 ln cm r ln r and can reliably be estimated as the slope in ln c m r versus ln r plot the slope can be computed by the least squares fit of a straight line scaling region over a length scales of r 2 2 chaos based parameters and prediction model 2 2 1 local approximation prediction model lpm phase space reconstruction psr parameters are essential for the implementation of the local approximation prediction model lpm and the technique used by lpm is referred to in the paper is schedule 2 which is described in section 4 2 schedule 2 comprises the use of mif to identify the τ values and a trial and error procedure to estimate the m value psr parameters facilitate an interpretation of the underlying dynamics in the form of an m dimensional map f t expressed as 8 y j t f t y j where y j y j and y j t y j t are vectors of dimension m describing the state of the system at times j i e the current state and j t i e the future state respectively the problem then is to find an appropriate expression for f t i e f t local approximation entails the subdivision of the f t domain into many subsets neighbourhoods each of which identifies some approximations f t valid only in that same subset in other words the dynamics of the system is locally described step by step in the phase space in this m dimensional space prediction is performed by estimating the change of x i with time considering the relation between the points x t and x t p the behaviour at a future time p on the attractor is approximated by function f as 9 x t p f x t in this prediction method the change of x t with time on the attractor is assumed to be the same as those of nearby points x t h h 1 n herein x t p is determined by the dth order polynomial f x t as follows itoh 1995 10 x t p f 0 k 1 0 m 1 f 1 k 1 x t k 1 τ k 2 k 1 k 1 0 m 1 f 2 k 1 k 2 x t k τ 1 x t k 2 τ k d k d 1 k 2 k 1 k 1 0 m 1 f dk 1 k 2 k d x t k 1 τ x t k 2 τ x t k d τ using n of x t h and x t h p for which the values are already known the coefficients f are determined by the solution of the following equation 11 x a f where 12 x x t 1 p x t 2 p x t n p and 13 f f 0 f 1 0 f 1 1 f 1 m 1 f 2 00 f d m 1 m 1 m 1 and a is the n m d m d jacobian matrix which in its explicit form is 14 a 1 x t 1 x t 1 τ x t 1 m 1 τ x t 1 2 x t 1 m 1 τ d 1 x t 2 x t 2 τ x t 2 m 1 τ x t 2 2 x t 2 m 1 τ d 1 x t n x t n τ x t n m 1 τ x t n 2 x t n m 1 τ d in order to obtain a stable solution the number of rows in the jacobian matrix a must satisfy 15 n m d m d as stated by porporato and ridolfi 1997 even though f values are first degree polynomials the prediction is nonlinear because during the prediction procedure every point x t belongs to a different neighbourhood and is therefore defined by different expressions for f kocak 1997 2 2 2 selection of τ and m values three different schedules are available to estimate psr parameters τ and m values as follows schedule 1 relates to the techniques given in section 2 1 and comprises the use of mif to identify the optimum τ and fnn to that of the optimum m schedule 2 relates to the techniques outlined in section 2 2 1 and to be detailed in section 4 2 which comprises the use of mif to identify τ but use a trial and error procedure to estimate m schedule 3 is developed by the paper which seeks to minimise rmse between observed and the forecasts by searching the space of psr parameters for all values of τ 1 20 and m 1 100 this may be implemented in various ways and the schedule used by the paper is based on constructing an ann model for each value of delay time and embedding dimension thus schedule 3 ensures that the globally optimum values of psr parameters are passed to chaos mggp models 2 3 multi gene genetic programming mggp mggp is a variation of gp first suggested by hinchliffe et al 1998 similar to other gp variants these prediction problems are capable of a truly bottom up process for potentially not making any assumption on the structure of the relationship between independent and dependent variables the identification of the appropriate relationship is also part of the prediction problem mggp is an automatic programming technique and similar to gp builds up the model in terms of i terminals which are composed of values of constants and variables ii functions which comprise mathematical operators and iii these together form gene structures and a collection of genes form a chromosome for more details see searson 2015 mggp linearly combines low depth gp trees in order to improve fitness of traditional gp searson 2009 mggp is expected to provide simpler models than those of traditional monolithic gp for using smaller trees as per eq 16 in mggp the construction of the relationship between predictand y and predictors xi i e multigene program or model is made possible by linear summation of at least two straightforward genes i e n 2 plus a random constant b which is called bias 16 y b i 1 n a i f x i where the term a i f x i is weighted output of each genes computed by evolutionary processes the main evolutionary processes in mggp and similar other techniques are as follows crossover operations are responsible for maintaining identical features from one generation parents to another offspring mutation refers to a random change in each gene and the reproduction secures the survival of the better performing multigenes moving to the next generation directly the bias and weights i e regression coefficients can be determined by a goodness of fit measure like least squares procedure for each multigene model technical details on the mggp can be obtained from searson 2015 and danandeh mehr and nourani 2017 the modelling parameters adopted in this study for performing both the standalone mggp and hybrid chaos mggp are outlined in section 4 2 4 chaos mggp hybrid model as illustrated in fig 1 the paper develops a hybrid of chaos theory with mggp which involves the following main steps i schedule 3 is employed to identify the optimum delay time and embedding dimension of the target variable to reconstruct its phase space and this defines the model structure as appropriate to the chaos mggp hybrid model elaborated below ii the phase space signals together with original series are entered to the mggp engine to discover the relation between input and target variables notably dominant input signals series produced by schedule 3 are embedded in chaos mggp and this is similar to uyumaz et al 2014 2 5 model structure for mggp and chaos mggp the usual regressive type of model structure for forecasting is 17 y t f y t y t 1 y t i for mggp the model structure is simply expressed as 7 steps of delay times as follows 18 y t f y t y t 1 y t 2 y t 3 y t 4 y t 5 y t 6 mggp identifies automatically the dependence on the significance of the older delay times for chaos mggp this is set by the psr to illustrate both an example is presented in table 1 in which the time series is assumed to have 100 data points with the values of y 1 y 2 y 3 y 4 y 5 y 100 but the array of their predicted values is denoted by y 1 y 2 y 3 y 4 y 5 y 100 the example runs the risk of being too simple and of removing all the niceties but expresses the essential complexity more clearly for mggp there are 7 terms lagging the forecast value and for chaos mggp assume that τ 5 m 3 and therefore the model structure is as illustrated in table 1 3 physical systems and their data description 3 1 study area the models developed in this study are trained and validated by using case studies from four rivers of differing hydrological and hydrometric characters with flows of intermittent and perennial river types the investigation uses historical daily discharge as follows i a gauging station on eherchay aharchay a tributary of qarasu which flows to the river araz a basin of the caspian sea ii a gauging station on the river livan also written as lighvan a tributary of aji chay a basin of lake urmia iii the sogutluhan gauging station on kizilirmak iv and the yamula gauging station also on kizilirmak a basin of the black sea the names are presented in alphabetical orders the locations of these rivers are shown in fig 2 the first two of which are located in the east azerbaijan province northwest iran and the other two in the central anatolia turkey along kizilirmak which is the longest river in turkey and flows to the black sea data summary and availability in these stations are given in table 2 and the data record is displayed in fig 3 the mean values in table 2 suggest that perhaps the flow at livan maximum of 6 1 m3s 1 is likely to be of low magnitude to warrant any real dynamic effects however the data was not removed from this study purely on the basis of producing numerically plausible results 3 2 evaluation criteria the performance of the models is evaluated by goodness of fit measures using i and root mean squared error rmse and ii the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient the perfect fit model will have rmse value of 0 0 and nse of 1 the training datasets were chosen at 75 of the length of the time series and the testing datasets covered their remaining 25 4 results 4 1 detection of chaotic signals and psr parameters for schedule 1 the performance of the chaos mggp model for the prediction of daily river flows is the main focus of the paper but the key for this modelling strategy is the detection of chaotic signals in the data and this requires the construction of the phase space diagrams as shown in fig 4 the results for each station invoke visual evidence for existence of well defined attractors and justify the application of low dimensional chaos theory for the cases studies the detection of chaotic signals is further investigated by using the correlation dimension method through identifying whether or not the correlation exponent value can become saturated with the increased embedding dimension sivakumar and jayawardena 2002 fig 5 shows the relationship between the correlation integral c r and the radius r using eq 6 for m from 1 to 20 the figure provides evidence for a possible existence of chaos as all the curves pass through a saturation point schedule 1 results are presented in table 3 which gives the optimum delay time values derived by mif using eq 3 and embedding dimension by fnn using eq 4 for each observation station fig 6 presents the relationship between the correlation exponent values of d and values of m using eq 7 for the four stations according to the figure the correlation exponent value d increases with m up to a certain dimension beyond which it becomes saturated and this is an indication of existence of deterministic dynamics sivakumar and jayawardena 2002 the saturated correlation dimension shown in fig 6 is 2 5 the nearest integer above the saturation value provides the minimum dimension of the dynamic system islam and sivakumar 2002 and wang et al 2009 notably the correlation dimension analysis only provides information on the number of variables dominantly influencing the dynamics of the phenomenon but does not identify the variables islam and sivakumar 2002 for instance the correlation dimension of 2 5 indicates that at least 3 independent variables are needed to describe the dynamics of the river time series 4 2 local approximation prediction model and psr parameters by schedules 2 and 3 the local approximation prediction model lpm is used for predicting daily river flow time series from the four measurement stations lpm intrinsically contains schedule 2 for the identification of the psr parameters τ and m implemented through the following procedure i identify the τ values using mif ii vary m in a range say 1 12 iii for each value of m and estimate the value of nse and rmse and iv select the embedding dimension with the highest nse coefficient and lowest rmse and this will serve as the basis for the lpm solutions the m values are given in table 4 for the four gauging stations it shows that the best forecasts are achieved when the values of embedding dimension are m 12 for eherchay m 3 for livan river m 1 for the sogutluhan and m 8 for the yamula stations it is normal practice to use these values in the final implementation of lpm and its prediction results are discussed in section 5 4 3 values of τ and m for chaos mggp models the schedule 2 values of delay time τ and embedding dimension m are also presented in table 3 for comparison these values could have been transferred to chaos mggp models but to eliminate the risk of using local minima values schedule 3 is introduced which caters for the global optimum values by varying the values of m from 1 to 20 and τ from 1 to 100 in this way ann is used to generate 2000 prediction runs and estimating the performance measures of rmse and nse for each run their contours given in fig 7 identified the global optimum values of τ and m which are given in table 3 the figure shows that the landscape of τ m values have many local minima and therefore the procedure selected in this study for the deriving τ and m values for chaos mggp is logical 4 4 results of mggp and chaos mggp the procedure for preliminary preparations in any gp based modelling including both the mggp and chaos mggp runs is through the following steps i create an initial population of multigenes by specifying a primitive set of terminals in the form of predefined input variables for each station as well as functions and a set of random constants chosen in the range 1 0 and 1 0 as potential members of terminal sets ii define a fitness function to rank the initial population of multigenes and this is often rmse and referred to as the fitness function iii evolve new populations of multigenes using evolutionary operators of reproduction crossover and mutations iv rank each new population based on the fitness value of each multigene v repeat steps iii and iv terminate the run when reached either a predefined fitness value or maximum number of generations the functions for both mggp and chaos mggp models in this study are predefined by the following three basic arithmetic operations i e addition subtraction and multiplication to ensure that the fitted models are parsimonious normalised daily river flow observations at time t 1 are model outputs at each station predefined input variables for mggp models at each station are normalised daily river flow observations and their antecedent values back to optimum delay time for chaos mggp models in this study the phase space signals with different dimensions are considered as predefined input variables table 5 gives the default parameters for mggp and chaos mggp runs as selected in this study preliminary preparations of mggp and chaos mggp are similar but the model structure for chaos mggp is set by optimum values of m and τ as per table 3 the chaos mggp model uses the value of schedule 3 given in table 3 in which the m values are not necessarily the same as those identified by schedule 2 and used by lpm 5 discussion the paper produced three sets of phase space reconstruction psr parameters of delay time τ and embedding dimension m schedule 1 to schedule 3 the processing of delay time in schedules 1 and 2 is identical but schedule 3 confirms their results despite using a slightly different procedure however the embedding dimension among schedules 1 3 differ somewhat as they rely on different search algorithms for optimum values of psr parameters although schedule 3 renders globally optimum set of values it is rather computationally costly the results of performance measures of the three models lpm mggp and chaos mggp are given in table 6 according to which their performances are acceptable however the hybrid chaos mggp performs better than the two benchmark models of lpm and mggp also mggp performs slightly better than lpm in three test cases livan sogutluhan and yamula but lpm performs slightly better than mggp in one test case eherchay to understand comparative performances of these models their scatter diagrams are displayed in fig 8 for all the stations which shows less scatters with chaos mggp than lpm or mggp attention is given to the scatter of the residuals observed minus modelled values and the results are shown in fig 9 for the testing phase it provides evidence that i the scatters associated with the chaos mggp model are significantly narrower than those for the other two models ii the difference between lpm and mggp is marginal and as discussed above they have a mixed fortune i e in one case lpm performs better than mggp but mggp performs better than lpm in the other three cases see table 6 iii the residuals are distributed randomly and there is no trend suggested by these results and iv at extreme residuals reliabilities of predicted results are poor for the three models the simplified mathematical expression of the best mggp eq 1 and chaos mggp eq 2 models developed for one day ahead of river flow prediction at eherchay livan sogultuhan and yamula

would be carried out in the future for testing the capability for river flow prediction on a long term basis comparison of chaos mggp results with other modelling strategies would also be informative 6 conclusions a new data driven model is developed and tested in this paper which integrates multigene genetic programming mggp with chaos theory to be referred to as chaos mggp river flow records from four gauging stations two stations on intermittent streams and two stations on perennial rivers were used to train and test the chaos mggp model the original river flow observation time series were transformed into multi dimension phase spaces and the subsequent analysis by the various techniques of chaos theory demonstrated existence of the dynamics of chaotic behaviour in the data the optimum values of phase space reconstruction psr parameters delay time τ and embedding dimension m were obtained by three schedules schedule 1 uses mutual information function mif to identify delay time and false nearest neighbour fnn to identify embedding dimension schedule 2 uses the procedure intrinsic in lpm by replacing fnn with a trial and error procedure and iii schedule 3 seeks the global optimum values of psr parameters in the landscape of τ m values the results show that psr is able to capture the essential dynamics of chaotic system existing in river flow series through the parameters of delay time and embedding dimension the paper presents the results of three models constructed for the four datasets lpm mggp and chaos mggp the performances of these models are compared at each station in terms of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and root mean square errors rmse measures the performance measures reveal that the chaos mggp model provides significant improvements over the two benchmark models of using local approximation prediction model lpm and the standalone mggp whereas these benchmark models are still fit for purpose and there is not much to choose between their performances the authors have also integrated psr parameters with regression equations and hybrid also suggestive of significant improvements and are planning to test hybrids with other modelling strategies however the improvements by chaos mggp is based on using schedule 3 for psr parameters which are computationally costly abarbanel 1996 h d i abarbanel analysis of observed chaotic data 1996
