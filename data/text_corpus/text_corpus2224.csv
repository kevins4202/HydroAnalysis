11120,the future of the south asia s rice wheat rw production system is at stake due to continuously depleting aquifers and increasing pressure on underground water under projected climate change scenario conventional management factors such as flood irrigation intensive tillage and residue burning are threatening sustainability of rw system with increasing adoption of conservation agriculture ca sub surface drip fertigation ssdf provides an exceptional opportunity for complementing irrigation water saving benefits presently there is no research evidence on optimum spacing and depth for drip laterals in a ca direct drilling and residue mulch based rw system around the globe this study was therefore planned to evaluate effects of residue mulch different spacing and depths of laterals for ssdf on crop yield irrigation water productivity wpi nitrogen use efficiency nue and net returns for ca based rw system in a silt loam soil in northwestern india drip laterals were spaced either at 33 75 cm or 67 5 cm and installation depths were 0 15 or 20 cm beneath the soil surface and compared with conventional and zero tillage based flood irrigated rw systems grain yield and irrigation water input in rice and wheat were generally similar under different ssdf treatments irrigation water savings were 48 53 in rice and 42 53 in wheat under combination of ssdf and ca compared to flood irrigation system a similar trend in wpi was recorded in both the crops residue mulch contributed to higher irrigation water savings wheat yield and wpi compared to no mulch both rice and wheat needed 20 less n fertilizer under ssdf system to obtain grain yields similar to that under flood irrigated crops net returns from ssdf system with 67 5 cm lateral spacing were significantly higher compared to flood irrigation system in conclusion ssdf system having laterals spaced at 67 5 cm and installed at 15 cm depth provides tangible benefits for substantial saving in irrigation water and energy and increasing nue and net income for ca based rw system in south asia keywords conservation agriculture direct seeded rice subsurface drip irrigation fertigation irrigation water productivity lateral spacing and depth net returns nitrogen use efficiency 1 introduction rice oryza sativa l wheat triticum aestivum l rw is the most important cereal based cropping system for food security and livelihood for millions of people and is practiced on 13 5 million ha in the indo gangetic plains of south asia ladha et al 2009 sustainability of rw system continues to be adversely impacted by the practice of puddling the soil before transplanting rice seedlings traditional rw system consumes large amount 1800 2400 mm of irrigation water and is energy and labor intensive and deteriorates soil health chauhan et al 2012 jat et al 2017 the sustainability of the rw production systems of south asia has become a major concern owing to alarming depletion of water table stagnating or declining productivity growth and diminishing economic returns humphreys et al 2010 since early 1970s there has been a steady decline in groundwater table in most of the rw area of north west nw india humphreys et al 2010 moreover climate change will future increase water demand globally by about 40 of the water needed for irrigation without global warming thereby reducing water availability in areas where irrigation is most needed fischer et al 2007 under the emerging scenario of acute shortages of water in future it is imperative that we focus our efforts to develop alternative efficient approaches for water use in irrigated rw system in nw india yadvinder et al 2014a scented basmati rice is known for its aromatic quality and high economic value as it generates about three times higher price than coarse rice around 65 of total global supply of scented rice is contributed by india and earned foreign exchange of us 4 25 billion in 2014 15 apeda 2015 scented rice occupies about 20 2 1 million ha of total area under rw system in india and the nw states punjab haryana and western uttar pradesh account for 90 of its total production in india and has been promoted as water use efficient alternative in the rw system scented rice responds well to dry direct seeding dsr which has been identified as one of the alternative to puddled transplanted rice ptr to address the issues of growing shortages and increasing costs of labor water and energy scarcity in nw india chauhan et al 2012 other agronomic practices to save irrigation water in rw system include cultivation of short duration cultivars shifting planting time of rice towards period of low evaporation demand zero tillage and straw mulching yadvinder et al 2014a crop residues regulate soil temperature improve soil health and increase crop yields in dsr and wheat jat et al 2017 yadvinder et al 2014b the other approaches suggested saving water and increase water productivity wp in different crops includes change from flood irrigation systems to micro irrigation systems ayars et al 1999 yadvinder et al 2014a drip irrigation has now been considered economically viable option for field row crops such as maize rice and wheat chen et al 2015 lamm et al 1997 sharda et al 2017 however uptake of these water saving options has remained slow for field crops in general and rw system in particular due to their field applications surface drip issues with conventional tillage based management systems wherein drip laterals has to be removed and placed at multiple times due to several operations during the growing season compared to surface drip fertigation sdf subsurface drip fertigation ssdf system eliminates necessity of anchoring laterals during the crop growing season and thus laterals have longer economic life under ssdf system ayars et al 1999 the ssdf system limits evaporation from the soil allows better delivery of water and nutrients directly to the root zone which leads to efficient fertilizer application discourages weed growth and reduces labour cost and it is easier to perform cultural farming practices in ssdf compared to sdf ayars et al 1999 conservation agriculture ca based cereal rotations rice wheat maize wheat allows crop residue recycling which are otherwise burnt saves irrigation water lowers energy use and increases farmers profit gathala et al 2013 jat et al 2014 and complement the use of ssdf system the spacing and depth of lateral driplines in ssdf system need optimization for a double cropping system the lateral spacing should be selected to provide the flexibility and suitability of using the same irrigation network for both the crops in a given cropping system without vital replacement and modifications adoption of similar row bed spacing for the two crops in a system may be advantageous provided that the crops produce adequate yields under that spacing ayars et al 1999 the soil texture hydraulic properties and density climate characteristics and crop rooting characteristics also affect the required lateral spacing and depth researchers lamm et al 1997 ayars et al 1999 used dripline spacing of 140 150 cm for maize one dripline for every two crop rows on fine texture soils in usa sharda et al 2017 used surface dripline spacing of 50 cm for rice for achieving higher yields compared to flood irrigation other studies chen et al 2015 chouhan et al 2015 wang et al 2013 laid driplines at a spacing of 50 60 cm depending on row width for sdf ssdf system in wheat on fine textured soils dripline depths ranging from 15 to 70 cm were found to be acceptable for optimum maize production with no significant differences in wp lamm et al 1997 studies have also shown that application of fertilizer along with drip irrigation improves nutrient use efficiency while reducing fertilizer usage and nitrogen losses as leaching and volatilization hagin et al 2003 and references therein most of the earlier studies on sdf or ssdf system are based on individual crops and not system based scientific information on the ssdf system for the important rw cropping system is not available from south asia as well as other parts of the globe we hypothesized that development of ssdf technology will reduce irrigation water consumption and increase irrigation water productivity wpi and nitrogen use efficiency in ca based rice wheat system the objectives of this study were 1 to optimize the spacing and depth of laterals for ssdf system under ca based management in relation to grain yield water and energy saving and wpi and 2 to evaluate the effects of n fertigation on crop yields and n use efficiency in ca based scented rice wheat cropping system in nw india 2 methods 2 1 experimental site a field experiment was conducted for 2 years

das 70 mm in t7 and t8 only around mt stage and subsequent irrigations were applied to a given treatment whenever mean smp decreased to 35 1 kpa in fi treatments irrigation water was delivered to each plot one at a time using pvc pipe to avoid conveyance losses irrigations to each treatment were controlled manually from a manifold that has a flow meter all the four replications of a particular treatment received similar amount of irrigation at the same time 2 5 crop management 2 5 1 rice conventional till plots were flood irrigated about 75 mm prior to wet tillage prior to the ptr t8 there were two discings and one spring tyne tiller followed by wet tillage puddling comprising two tillers and two plankings leveling by dragging a heavy metal bar operations both rice and wheat were sown with a row spacing of 22 5 cm the dsr scented rice pusa 1509 was sown on 8th july in 2014 and 29th july in 2015 by drilling seed at field capacity moisture regime using a seed rate of 20 kg ha 1 at a depth of 2 3 cm using a turbo happy seeder sidhu et al 2015 with a inclined plate seed metering system the rice nursery for the ptr treatments was seeded on the date of dsr twenty eight and 24 day old rice seedlings were transplanted manually in rows 22 5 cm apart with plant to plant spacing of 15 cm in ptr plots on 5th august 2014 and 22nd august 2015 respectively a basal dose of 26 kg p as diammonium phosphate dap and 25 kg k ha 1 as muriate of potash mop was applied at transplanting seeding to all the plots after the harvest of each crop driplines from sdf plots were removed and re laid immediately after the seeding of next crop in the rw system the crop in dsr treatments was sprayed once with 1 ferrous sulphate solution 250 l ha 1 at 15 das to correct fe deficiency symptoms yellowing or chlorosis of the interveinal area of leaves rice crop were manually harvested at physiological maturity on 3rd november 2014 and 14th november 2015 2 5 2 wheat as in case of rice ct plots

kg ha 1 at 3 4 cm depth with a turbo happy seeder sidhu et al 2015 before sowing of wheat rice residues were manually spread in residue retention treatments in both the years of study in 2014 15 zt and ct wheat was sown on 8th november 2014 and 10th november 2014 respectively in 2015 16 wheat in the zt and ct treatments was sown on 17th november 2015 and 20th november 2015 respectively the ct wheat required additional time for tillage operations while zt wheat was direct seeded without any tillage operation a basal dose of 26 kg p as dap and 25 kg k ha 1 as mop was drilled along with seed at sowing to all the plots recommended practices were used for managing weeds pests and disease stresses in both wheat and rice crops wheat crop was manually harvested about 10 12 cm above ground level at physiological maturity on 23 april 2015 and 17 april 2016 2 6 observations and calculations 2 6 1 irrigation water input the volume of water applied for each irrigation was measured with the help of water meter dasmesh mechanical works punjab india fitted to the delivery pipe close to the experimental plots total amount of irrigation water mm applied was computed for each crop 2 6 2 grain yield and irrigation water productivity at maturity grain and straw yields were determined on an area of 10 m2 in the middle of each plot by manually cutting the plants at ground level grain moisture content was determined by oven drying subsamples at 60 c grain yield was expressed as t ha 1 at 12 and 14 grain moisture content in wheat and rice respectively wpi was computed as the ratio of grain yield kg ha 1 to total irrigation water applied m3 ha 1 to rice and wheat and is reported as kg m 3 2 6 3 partial factor productivity on nitrogen partial factor productivity of applied nitrogen pfpn is the grain yield obtained per kg of applied n and was expressed as kg grain kg 1 of n applied in each treatment the pfpn provides an integrative index of that quantifies grain yield relative to utilization of all n resources in the system including indigenous soil n and fertilizer n 2 7 economic analysis partial budgeting was used to determine the economics of the subsurface drip irrigation system partial budget is a useful at depicting farmer s financial effects by considering only parts of the farm business that would be affected in our partial budget the net returns were the additional revenue that would result from using the ssd irrigation system the variable costs used in the analysis included the costs of operations e g nursery raising tillage for seed bed preparation seeding harvesting threshing and inputs seed irrigation fertilizers agrochemicals and labour for raising the crops table 2 the economic analysis did not include fixed costs such as land value and interest all inputs and technologies used in the enterprise budget were as per the recommendations of punjab agricultural university table 2 the following assumptions were used in our partial budget analysis to perform economic analysis number of labors required for seeding transplanting weeding pesticide herbicide and fertilizer application and harvesting etc were recorded the time h required to complete each field operation in each treatment was recorded and expressed as person days ha 1 considering 8 h to be equivalent to 1 person day similarly the time h required by a tractor drawn machine implement to complete a field operation such as tillage seeding and harvesting was recorded and expressed as h ha 1 the prices of inputs such as seeds fertilizers pesticides fuel herbicide etc were recorded for irrigation costs the charges fixed by the electricity board of punjab government rs 0 30 per kwh of electricity were used plus the cost of labour used for irrigation application total number of irrigations ranged from 44 to 53 for rice and 16 to 21 for wheat under ssdf treatments during the two years of study labor cost was set at rs 350 per man day cost of drip irrigation system was calculated after considering 80 subsidy provided by the govt of india on the actual cost rs 250 103 ha 1 the cost incurred on the drip system was calculated considering the life span of 20 years for main sub main venturi and pump life of surface and subsurface drip irrigation system was considered as 8 yrs and 15 yrs respectively depreciation cost of drip irrigation system was considered as 10 the gross returns gr included income from sale of rice and wheat grain and wheat straw the minimum support price msp fixed by the government for basmati rice and wheat grains was used for calculating gross returns table 2 net return from each treatment was calculated after subtracting variable costs from the calculated gr indian rs was converted to us based on a conversion rate of indian rs for 1 us 2 8 statistical analysis the data were analyzed by analysis of variance anova technique for completely randomized block design using sas 9 1 software sas institute cary nc differences between treatment means were compared using fisher s least significant difference lsd tests at the 5 probability level 3 results and discussion 3 1 weather 3 1 1 rice season rainfall during the 2014 376 mm and 2015 257 mm rice seasons was much lower than the long term average june september of 532 mm the pattern of rainfall distribution was also quite different during the two seasons with low rain in august 2014 and july 2015 and nearly similar rainfall in september 2014 and 2015 figs 2 and 3a monthly pan evaporation each rice season was generally similar to the long term average fig 3a except for higher than usual values in the months of july and august 2014 and lower than usual in october 2014 as a result total pan evaporation in june september 2014 458 mm was higher than the long term average 411 mm but it was similar to that of long term average in 2015 419 mm minimum monthly temperature was 1 2 c higher than the long term average throughout the rice season each year apart from a similar value in september 2014 fig 3b maximum monthly temperatures were generally similar to the long term averages apart from a higher value in july 2014 and lower value in september 2014 3 1 2 wheat season total rainfall during the 2014 15 wheat crop was 227 mm half of which fell in march figs 2a and 3 a higher than the long term november april average of 122 mm the 2015 16 wheat season was drier half of which fell in march fig 2b with total growing season rainfall of 90 mm monthly pan evaporation each wheat season tended to be similar to or lower than the long term average apart from much lower values in january each year and higher values in april 2015 16 total pan evaporation november april was 511 and 598 mm in 2014 15 and 2015 16 respectively than the long term average 578 mm mean monthly maximum and minimum temperatures was higher than the long term values during both the year apart from higher minimum values in february march during both year and lower maximum values in april 2014 15 fig 3b 3 2 grain yield straw mulch r had no significant effect on grain yield of rice t2 vs t3 and t5 vs t6 table 3 also most drip irrigation treatments had non significant effect on grain yield of rice compared to fi both zt and ct except ztrw r ssdf67 5 15 t5 which resulted in significantly higher grain yield compared to ctrw r fi t8 in 2014 such non significant effect of small amount of standing wheat stubbles 2 t ha 1 plus remnant of rice residue 2 t ha 1 from previous wheat season on yield of dsr as observed in our study were also reported in similar soil and climatic conditions by naveen et al 2016 since wheat straw is a valuable cattle fodder for the farmers in the region and 75 80 of the straw is collected from the fields and no response of rice to mulching is a win win depth of placement of laterals 15 cm vs 20 cm in sub surface drip irrigation system showed no significant effect on grain yields of rice in 2014 at the same dripline depth 15 cm spacing of laterals at 67 5 cm and residues removal t5 resulted in significantly higher rice yield than that spacing at 33 75 cm t2 in 2015 there was no significant effect of any of the treatments on grain yield of rice table 3 ramulu et al 2016 reported that each dripper line spaced at 80 cm was sufficient for feeding four rice crop rows on a clay loam soil results from studies by nagaraju et al 2014 and sharda et al 2017 revealed that dsr recorded significantly higher grain yield under sdi with laterals spaced at 60 cm with emitters at a distance of 40 cm in dsr compared to fi ptr higher grain yield in ssdf treatments was ascribed to favourable conditions provided for water and n supply under drip irrigation cum fertigation however in our study grain yield of dsr was similar in both drip irrigated and fi plots well distributed rain during the rice 2015 season fig 2b further nullified the effect of drip irrigation on crop yields in wheat residue retention as mulch significantly increased the mean grain yield of wheat by 7 2 compared to no residue t2 vs t3 during 2014 15 whereas on the grain yield was on par during 2015 16 table 3 the increase in grain yield of wheat under residue mulch may be ascribed to the positive effects of mulch on soil temperature modifications and soil moisture supply and improvement in soil quality parameters such as soc and nutrient availability jat et al 2017 yadvinder et al 2014b earlier studies yadvinder et al 2014b and references therein reported greater benefits of straw mulch on grain yield of fi wheat compared to the current study probably the effect of straw mulch on reducing evaporation under ssdf system was small as soil surface remained dry during most of the wheat growing season depth of placement of laterals 15 cm vs 20 cm in drip irrigation system showed no significant effect on grain yield in the first year whereas it was significantly higher at 15 cm depth compared to 20 cm in second year using data from a single wheat cropping season chouhan et al 2015 reported 40 cm as optimum depth of lateral for ssdf system on a clay loam soil grain yield of wheat was significantly higher in drip irrigated treatments compared to fi both zt and ct in both years table 3 ssdf system has been reported to limit evaporation from the soil and allows delivery of water and nutrients directly to the root zone and thus leads to efficient fertilizer application compared to sdf ayars et al 1999 the lower wheat yields after ptr was in part was due to delay in wheat sowing by 3 4 days caused by extra time needed for seed bed preparation relative to zt wheat under ssdf system among the drip irrigated treatments there was no significant difference in wheat yield between the 33 75 and 67 5 cm dripline spacing which indicate that driplines spacing at 67 5 cm can be recommended as the cost of installing a drip system would be markedly reduced consistent with the results from our study other researchers chen et al 2015 chouhan et al 2015 reported optimum lateral spacing of 60 70 cm for wheat one lateral for every 3 rows in terms of achieving maximum yield and wp in wheat on fine textured soils which have the capability of moving water long distances from drip emitters results from our study show that to attain the similar crop yields under ssdf and fi systems the amount of fertilizer n needed for rice and wheat under ssdf system was 20 lower than in fi crops fertigation using ssdf can effectively manage the placement and availability of nutrients continuing to apply the same n rates used in conventional management systems to fertigated crops would probably result in lower n use efficiency by the crop and increased losses of n to the environment timing the fertigation to coincide with periods of demand from the crop growth curve nutrition is a common method of maximizing fertilizer use efficiency in many crops in our study fertilizer n was applied at weekly intervals compared to that applied in 2 3 splits in fi treatments based on experience in other crops the n rate is likely to be in order of 20 50 lower than rates in conventional management systems hagin et al 2003 and references therein nagaraju et al 2014 reported that fertigation resulted in 50 per cent fertilizer saving in rice of the recommended 125 kg n ha 1 in regions where rainfall around planting time is fairly reliable lamm et al 1997 advocated that different lateral spacings have not influenced maize yield to warrant the extra cost of a closer lateral spacing results from our study also confirm that a 67 5 cm lateral spacing with 15 cm lateral depth is better than a 33 75 cm lateral spacing and a 15 cm lateral depth for irrigated rice wheat system on the silt loam soil however such studies are needed to be evaluated for different soil types climatic conditions and irrigation availability for their wider applications 3 3 irrigation water input amount of irrigation water applied to rice through drip system was 53 0 and 43 2 lower compared to ct fi 1296 mm and fi zero tillage flood 1072 mm respectively in 2014 fig 4 similar was the trend in 2015 with 47 6 and 42 5 lower irrigation amount in drip irrigation system compared to fi in ct 1109 mm and zt rice 1010 mm fig 4 results from earlier studies ramulu et al 2016 sharda et al 2017 also showed that drip irrigation in dsr resulted in water savings of more than 40 50 compared to fi rice by reducing seepage deep drainage and evaporation losses as the small amounts of irrigation water were applied for every irrigation at 2 3 day interval thus keeping soil drier total amount of irrigation water applied to rice particularly in fi treatments was 124 mm more in the year 2014 compared to 2015 as the rains were fewer in 2014 in 2014 and 2015 irrigation water input in rice was 19 83 mm mean 50 mm and 34 59 mm mean 47 mm more in t5 laterals spaced at 67 5 cm with no mulch when compared with other drip irrigation treatments with residue mulch t1 t3 t4 t6 respectively the decrease in irrigation water input in residue mulch compared to no mulch plots was possibly due to reduction in evaporation losses sharda et al 2017 reported similar water savings in rice under sdf compared to fi due to lower evaporation and drainage losses under sdf effect of lateral depth on irrigation water input in rice was relatively small with 16 20 mm lower water input for 20 cm depth t4 compare to 15 cm depth t3 residue mulch in wheat reduced the irrigation water applied input by 40 7 and 41 9 mm compared to no mulch in 2014 and 2015 respectively fig 5 surface residues are known to reduce evaporation losses and conserve soil moisture thereby crops required less amount of irrigation water in wheat ram et al 2013 like in dsr amount of irrigation water applied to wheat through drip system was 41 9 and 40 3 lower compared with fi in ct 306 mm and zt 298 mm respectively in 2014 15 similar was the trend in 2015 16 with 52 6 and 58 1 lower irrigation amount in drip system compared to fi in ct 356 mm and zt 403 mm fig 5 the drip irrigated crop received water at a shorter interval 2 3 d interval in rice and 8 10 d interval in wheat subject to weather conditions whereas water was applied at a longer interval in the fi rice and wheat more water in fi treatments might contribute to percolation losses beyond the active root zone because the amount of water applied at each irrigation is higher than the soil water storage capacity consistent with the results from our study a number of researchers chen et al 2015 chouhan et al 2015 have reported significant reduction in irrigation water use with drip irrigation system compared to fi wheat by increasing application precision and reducing unneeded losses through drainage and evaporation applications water can be conserved and energy needed for pumping water can be saved in our study effects of spacing and depth of laterals on irrigation water input in wheat with straw mulch were generally small in ssdf system chouhan et al 2015 reported that installing the drip irrigation system at 60 cm lateral and with 30 cm dripper spacing provided uniform moisture distribution in the active root zone in wheat and led to large water saving in clay loam soil further studies are suggested to compute the complete water balance components under ssdf to report real water savings 3 4 irrigation water productivity wpi wpi of rice was significantly higher with residue mulch r and for drip irrigation treatments t1 t6 compared to no mulch r and fi treatments t7 and t8 in both rice seasons fig 6 savings in irrigation water due to reduced evaporation under surface mulch resulted in an increase in wpi over no mulch wpi of dsr in drip irrigation treatments ranged from 0 75 0 84 kg m 3 compared to 0 36 0 46 kg m 3 in fi treatments the findings from this study are consistent with the observations of sharda et al 2017 who reported that drip irrigation in dsr resulted in higher wpi 0 85 0 90 kg m 3 than fi 0 42 0 52 kg m 3 on a sandy loam soil under the similar climatic conditions large irrigation water savings in sdf ssdf compared to flood irrigation with similar or higher crop yields compared to fi resulted in the higher wpi chen et al 2015 since grain yield and irrigation water inputs were generally similar at different spacing and depth of laterals in straw mulch treatments no significant effects were recorded on wpi of rice in both the seasons the wpi of wheat was significantly higher in drip irrigation treatments compared to fi both zt and ct in both years fig 7 wpi in wheat in drip irrigated treatments ranged from 2 61 to 3 84 kg m 3 compared to 1 23 1 70 kg m 3 in fi treatments fig 7 in the drip irrigated wheat both irrigation water savings and increased yields resulted in higher wpi in both the years over fi the wpi in wheat was significantly higher with residue mulch compared to no mulch due to higher grain yield and lower irrigation input in both the seasons fig 7 spacing of laterals at 33 75 cm and 67 5 cm when compared at same depth 15 cm resulted in similar wpi in wheat this study revealed that drip irrigation in dsr has the potential to increase irrigation wpi by matching the water requirement of crop and reducing deep drainage losses and generally keeping soil drier and reducing soil evaporation ayars et al 1999 3 5 partial factor productivity of nitrogen nue described as partial factor productivity of applied n pfpn was significantly affected by drip irrigation and crop establishment of rice and wheat table 4 pfpn in t5 was significantly higher by 30 6 and 9 62 in rice and 33 8 and 52 1 in wheat compared to fi zt and fi ct treatments t7 and t8 respectively table 4 pfpn in rice was significantly higher at 67 5 cm lateral spacing t5 compared to that at 33 75 cm spacing t2 when residues were removed and laterals installed at 15 cm depth the pfpn was significantly higher in all the drip irrigation treatments t1 t6 compared with both ct and zt in fi wheat the results from present study are in contradiction with the observation of sharda et al 2017 who did not find any additional advantage of fertigation in dsr possibly due to high levels of n used in their study the fi zt wheat r t7 had 13 7 higher pfpn compared with fi ct wheat r t8 the pfpn of rice wheat rw system was significantly higher in all the drip irrigated treatments compared with both ct and zt fi wheat both spacing and depth of lateral showed no effect on pfpn in wheat and rw system the higher values of pfpn recoded under ssdf system compared to flood irrigation were mainly due to lower amount of n fertilizer needed to produce similar yields of rice and wheat and in part can be ascribed to higher wheat yields under ssdf system pfpn values differ among crops because they differ in their nutrient and water needs the pfpn were higher for rice than for wheat from an extensive review of 93 published studies ladha et al 2005 reported average values for pfpn were generally higher for rice 62 kg kg 1 n than for wheat 45 kg kg 1 n at least in part due to the higher n content of wheat grain however there is a need to determine the optimum rate and timing of n application under ssdf for both rice and wheat crops 3 6 economic analysis of rice wheat system economic benefit is an important consideration when evaluating crop management practices the results of the current study showed that the variable costs of production in rice and wheat were lower by rs 8 12 11 97 thousand ha 1 and rs 2 62 4 31 thousand ha 1 in ca based drip irrigation treatments t1 t6 than under conventional flood irrigated treatment t8 respectively table 5 the higher variable cost under conventional rw system t8 was primarily due to high labor and fuel cost for land preparation for and high cost for transplanting seedlings in rice similarly higher variable cost in zt flood irrigated rice t7 compared to drip irrigated treatments was due to more cost for irrigation water and labour cost for irrigation application gross returns in rice and wheat were significantly higher for ssdf with laterals spaced at 67 5 cm and laid 15 cm below soil surface t5 compared to treatment with laterals spaced at 33 75 cm and placed at 15 cm t2 and flood irrigated conventional till t8 and flood irrigated zt rice t7 table 5 gross returns gr in ssdf system with laterals spaced at 67 5 cm t5 were significantly higher compared with conventional flood irrigation system t8 due mainly to significantly higher yields of rice and wheat table 5 dripline cost is a large portion of the initial ssdf system cost drip laterals at 67 5 cm and buried at 15 cm or 20 cm depth result in half the number of drip laterals compared with that at 33 75 cm table 2 however in our study dripline spacing t4 vs t6 showed relatively small ca 4 effect on total variable cost because 80 of its cost is subsidized earlier studies in maize camp et al 1997 lamm and trooien 2003 showed that initial installation cost was lower by 30 to 40 when lateral spacing was increased by 100 the highest net returns nr recorded under ssdf system t1 t6 were owing to the combined effect of higher crop productivity with lesser cost of tillage and labour for seeding than the most prevalent conventional system t8 table 5 net returns from rw system from t5 were 10 9 and 29 8 higher compared flood irrigated t7 and t8 treatments respectively in sugarcane sivanappan 1994 reported that net profit of the drip irrigation system was 74 over the profit of the flood irrigation system benefit to cost ratio nr divided by total variable cost for ssdf system ranged from 3 55 to 4 42 compared to 2 55 for conventional rw system t8 the nr and benefit to cost ration from ssdf will still be higher when the subsidy is reduced to 25 from 80 considered in the current economic analysis economic analysis by sharda et al 2016 showed that although net income for surface drip irrigated rice was lower than for flood irrigation there was more than 40 irrigation water saving with the drip system under the similar climatic conditions in punjab india our study demonstrated that drip irrigation in rw system is a potential option for a water scarce future and to cope up with alarming ground water table depletion for example rw system in nw india under such situations the policy planners are exploring alternate options to incentivize farmers for more efficient water uses rather than providing free electricity for pumping for example the government of punjab india is piloting the direct benefit transfer on electricity dbte to farmers rather than free subsidized electricity for pumping water for irrigation to economize the water use in intensive rw system wherein drip irrigation technology will be immensely helpful moreover portfolio of ssdf and ca based management have complementarity from technology application and policy investment incentive perspective further under ssdf the life of drip irrigation system will be doubled due to non movement of the laterals as well as protection from sun etc which not only help farmers to reduce cost but also to governments to save on subsidies incentives on drip irrigation hence drip irrigation system will be an economically as well as ecologically viable alternative under both scenarios of i current subsidy regime on drip irrigation system 80 coupled with free electricity or ii pricing of water pumping no electricity subsidy but incentivizing the water saving technologies in agriculture the latter option will be more promising and futuristic for impact at scale and contribute to sustainable development goals sdgs 4 conclusions our study has provided science based first evidence of using subsurface drip fertigation ssdf system as means of saving precious irrigation water increasing irrigation water productivity and improving n use efficiency in ca based rice wheat rw system zero till with straw mulch in ssdf system further helped in irrigation water saving and increasing wpi over no mulch the dripline lateral spacing of 67 5 cm and a depth of 15 cm were optimum for ssdf in ca based rice wheat production system on silt loam soil in nw india fertigation using subsurface drip irrigation saved 20 of n fertilizer thus increasing n use efficiency compared to flood irrigation we used a single n rate and a fixed 7 day fertigation schedule in this study therefore optimum n rate and fertigation schedule need to be standardized for both rice and wheat crops to further improve yield and nue our results demonstrated that it is possible to further improve rice and wheat productivity irrigation water productivity and n use efficiency with reduced global warming potential by adopting the drip irrigation system coupled with ca in nw india the findings from our study have broader implications for dramatically reducing ground water pumping for irrigation to produce similar or higher yields in rw system in nw india and in other regions of south asia where water table is showing depleting at an alarming rate moreover since energy requirement for pumping of water using drip irrigation sdf or ssdf is 50 lower than that of flood irrigation can be met through solar powered pumps and hence reduces the water footprints significantly moreover the 50 saving in irrigation water by ssdf will contribute to sustainable intensification of rw system the results of our study provides i optimum design of subsurface drip irrigation system for ca based rw system and ii provides novel information and first such evidence useful for the researchers policy planners and farmers acknowledgements the

scenario conventional management factors such as flood irrigation intensive tillage and residue burning are threatening sustainability of rw system with increasing adoption of conservation agriculture ca sub surface drip fertigation ssdf provides an exceptional opportunity for complementing irrigation water saving benefits presently there is no research evidence on optimum spacing and depth for drip laterals in a ca direct drilling and residue mulch based rw system around the globe this study was therefore planned to evaluate effects of residue mulch different spacing and depths of laterals for ssdf on crop yield irrigation water productivity wpi nitrogen use efficiency nue and net returns for ca based rw system in a silt loam soil in northwestern india drip laterals were spaced either at 33 75 cm or 67 5 cm and installation depths were 0 15 or 20 cm beneath the soil surface and compared with conventional and zero tillage based flood irrigated rw systems grain yield and irrigation water input in rice and wheat were generally similar under different ssdf treatments irrigation water savings were 48 53 in rice and 42 53 in wheat under combination of ssdf and ca compared to flood irrigation system a similar trend in wpi was recorded in both the crops residue mulch contributed to higher irrigation water savings wheat yield and wpi compared to no mulch both rice and wheat needed 20 less n fertilizer under ssdf system to obtain grain yields similar to that under flood irrigated crops net returns from ssdf system with 67 5 cm lateral spacing were significantly higher compared to flood irrigation system in conclusion ssdf system having laterals spaced at 67 5 cm and installed at 15 cm depth provides tangible benefits for substantial saving in irrigation water and energy and increasing nue and net income for ca based rw system in south asia keywords conservation agriculture direct seeded rice subsurface drip irrigation fertigation irrigation water productivity lateral

livelihood for millions of people and is practiced on 13 5 million ha in the indo gangetic plains of south asia ladha et al 2009 sustainability of rw system continues to be adversely impacted by the practice of puddling the soil before transplanting rice seedlings traditional rw system consumes large amount 1800 2400 mm of irrigation water and is energy and labor intensive and deteriorates soil health chauhan et al 2012 jat et al 2017 the sustainability of the rw production systems of south asia has become a major concern owing to alarming depletion of water table stagnating or declining productivity growth and diminishing economic returns humphreys et al 2010 since early 1970s there has been a steady decline in groundwater table in most of the rw area of north west nw india humphreys et al 2010 moreover climate change will future increase water demand globally by about 40 of the water needed for irrigation without global warming thereby reducing water availability in areas where irrigation is most needed fischer et al 2007 under the emerging scenario of acute shortages of water in future it is imperative that we focus our efforts to develop alternative efficient approaches for water use in irrigated rw system in nw india yadvinder et al 2014a scented basmati rice is known for its aromatic quality and high economic value as it generates about three times higher price

of growing shortages and increasing costs of labor water and energy scarcity in nw india chauhan et al 2012 other agronomic practices to save irrigation water in rw system include cultivation of short duration cultivars shifting planting time of rice towards period of low evaporation demand zero tillage and straw mulching yadvinder et al 2014a crop residues regulate soil temperature improve soil health and increase crop yields in dsr and wheat jat et al 2017 yadvinder et al 2014b the other approaches suggested saving water and increase water productivity wp in different crops includes change from flood irrigation systems to micro irrigation systems ayars et al 1999 yadvinder et al 2014a drip irrigation has now been considered economically viable option for field row crops such as maize rice and wheat chen et al 2015 lamm et al 1997 sharda et al 2017 however uptake of these water saving options has remained slow for field crops in general and rw system in particular due to their field applications surface drip issues with conventional tillage based management systems wherein drip laterals has to be removed and placed at multiple times due to several operations during the growing season compared to surface drip fertigation sdf subsurface drip fertigation ssdf system eliminates necessity of anchoring laterals during the crop growing season and thus laterals have longer economic life under ssdf system ayars et al 1999 the ssdf system limits evaporation from the soil allows better delivery of water and nutrients directly to the root zone which leads to efficient fertilizer application discourages weed growth and reduces labour cost and it is easier to perform cultural farming practices in ssdf compared to sdf ayars et al 1999 conservation agriculture ca based cereal rotations rice wheat maize wheat allows crop residue recycling which are otherwise burnt saves irrigation water lowers energy use and increases farmers profit gathala et al 2013 jat et al 2014 and complement the use of ssdf system the spacing and depth of lateral driplines in ssdf system need optimization for a double cropping system the lateral spacing should be selected to provide the flexibility and suitability of using the same irrigation network for both the crops in a given cropping system without vital replacement and modifications adoption of similar row bed spacing for the two crops in a system may be advantageous provided that the crops produce adequate yields under that spacing ayars et al 1999 the soil texture hydraulic properties and density climate characteristics and crop rooting characteristics also affect the required lateral spacing and depth researchers lamm et al 1997 ayars et al 1999 used dripline spacing of 140 150 cm for maize one dripline for every two crop rows on fine texture soils in usa sharda et al 2017 used surface dripline spacing of 50 cm for rice for achieving higher yields compared to flood irrigation other studies chen et al 2015 chouhan et al 2015 wang et al 2013 laid driplines at a spacing of 50 60 cm depending on row width for sdf ssdf system in wheat on fine textured soils dripline depths ranging from 15 to 70 cm were found to be acceptable for optimum maize production with no significant differences in wp lamm et al 1997 studies have also shown that application of fertilizer along with drip irrigation improves nutrient use efficiency while reducing fertilizer usage and nitrogen losses as leaching and volatilization hagin et al 2003 and references therein most of the earlier studies on sdf or ssdf system are based on individual crops and not system based scientific information on the ssdf system for the important rw cropping system is not available from south asia as well as other parts of the globe we hypothesized that development of ssdf technology will reduce irrigation water consumption and increase irrigation water productivity wpi and nitrogen use efficiency in ca based rice wheat system the objectives of this study were 1 to optimize the spacing and depth of laterals for ssdf system under ca based management in relation to grain yield water and energy saving and wpi and 2 to evaluate the

term average apart from much lower values in january each year and higher values in april 2015 16 total pan evaporation november april was 511 and 598 mm in 2014 15 and 2015 16 respectively than the long term average 578 mm mean monthly maximum and minimum temperatures was higher than the long term values during both the year apart from higher minimum values in february march during both year and lower maximum values in april 2014 15 fig 3b 3 2 grain yield straw mulch r had no significant effect on grain yield of rice t2 vs t3 and t5 vs t6 table 3 also most drip irrigation treatments had non significant effect on grain yield of rice compared to fi both zt and ct except ztrw r ssdf67 5 15 t5 which resulted in significantly higher grain yield compared to ctrw r fi t8 in 2014 such non significant effect of small amount of standing wheat stubbles 2 t ha 1 plus remnant of rice residue 2 t ha 1 from previous wheat season on yield of dsr as observed in our study were also reported in similar soil and climatic conditions by naveen et al 2016 since wheat straw is a valuable cattle fodder for the farmers in the region and 75 80 of the straw is collected from the fields and no response of rice to mulching is a win win depth of placement of laterals 15 cm vs 20 cm in sub surface drip irrigation system showed no significant effect on grain yields of rice in 2014 at the same dripline depth 15 cm spacing of laterals at 67 5 cm and residues removal t5 resulted in significantly higher rice yield than that spacing at 33 75 cm t2 in 2015 there was no significant effect of any of the treatments on grain yield of rice table 3 ramulu et al 2016 reported that each dripper line spaced at 80 cm was sufficient for feeding four rice crop rows on a clay loam soil results from studies by nagaraju et al 2014 and sharda et al 2017 revealed that dsr recorded significantly higher grain yield under sdi with laterals spaced at 60 cm with emitters at a distance of 40 cm in dsr compared to fi ptr higher grain yield in ssdf treatments was ascribed to favourable conditions provided for water and n supply under drip irrigation cum fertigation however in our study grain yield of dsr was similar in both drip irrigated and fi plots well distributed rain during the rice 2015 season fig 2b further nullified the effect of drip irrigation on crop yields in wheat residue retention as mulch significantly increased the mean grain yield of wheat by 7 2 compared to no residue t2 vs t3 during 2014 15 whereas on the grain yield was on par during 2015 16 table 3 the increase in grain yield of wheat under residue mulch may be ascribed to the positive effects of mulch on soil temperature modifications and soil moisture supply and improvement in soil quality parameters such as soc and nutrient availability jat et al 2017 yadvinder et al 2014b earlier studies yadvinder et al 2014b and references therein reported greater benefits of straw mulch on grain yield of fi wheat compared to the current study probably the effect of straw mulch on reducing evaporation under ssdf system was small as soil surface remained dry during most of the wheat growing season depth of placement of laterals 15 cm vs 20 cm in drip irrigation system showed no significant effect on grain yield in the first year whereas it was significantly higher at 15 cm depth compared to 20 cm in second year using data from a single wheat cropping season chouhan et al 2015 reported 40 cm as optimum depth of lateral for ssdf system on a clay loam soil grain yield of wheat was significantly higher in drip irrigated treatments compared to fi both zt and ct in both years table 3 ssdf system has been reported to limit evaporation from the soil and allows delivery of water and nutrients directly to the root zone and thus leads to efficient fertilizer application compared to sdf ayars et al 1999 the lower wheat yields after ptr was in part was due to delay in wheat sowing by 3 4 days caused by extra time needed for seed bed preparation relative to zt wheat under ssdf system among the drip irrigated treatments there was no significant difference in wheat yield between the 33 75 and 67 5 cm dripline spacing which indicate that driplines spacing at 67 5 cm can be recommended as the cost of installing a drip system would be markedly reduced consistent with the results from our study other researchers chen et al 2015 chouhan et al 2015 reported optimum lateral spacing of 60 70 cm for wheat one lateral for every 3 rows in terms of achieving maximum yield and wp in wheat on fine textured soils which have the capability of moving water long distances from drip emitters results from our study show that to attain the similar crop yields under ssdf and fi systems the amount of fertilizer n needed for rice and wheat under ssdf system was 20 lower than in fi crops fertigation using ssdf can effectively manage the placement and availability of nutrients continuing to apply the same n rates used in conventional management systems to fertigated crops would probably result in lower n use efficiency by the crop and increased losses of n to the environment timing the fertigation to coincide with periods of demand from the crop growth curve nutrition is a common method of maximizing fertilizer use efficiency in many crops in our study fertilizer n was applied at weekly intervals compared to that applied in 2 3 splits in fi treatments based on experience in other crops the n rate is likely to be in order of 20 50 lower than rates in conventional management systems hagin et al 2003 and references therein nagaraju et al 2014 reported that fertigation resulted in 50 per cent fertilizer saving in rice of the recommended 125 kg n ha 1 in regions where rainfall around planting time is fairly reliable lamm et al 1997 advocated that different lateral spacings have not influenced maize yield to warrant the extra cost of a closer lateral spacing results from our study also confirm that a 67 5 cm lateral spacing with 15 cm lateral depth is better than a 33 75 cm lateral spacing and a 15 cm lateral depth for irrigated rice wheat system on the silt loam soil however such studies are needed to be evaluated for different soil types climatic conditions and irrigation availability for their wider applications 3 3 irrigation water input amount of irrigation water applied to rice through drip system was 53 0 and 43 2 lower compared to ct fi 1296 mm and fi zero tillage flood 1072 mm respectively in 2014 fig 4 similar was the trend in 2015 with 47 6 and 42 5 lower irrigation amount in drip irrigation system compared to fi in ct 1109 mm and zt rice 1010 mm fig 4 results from earlier studies ramulu et al 2016 sharda et al 2017 also showed that drip irrigation in dsr resulted in water savings of more than 40 50 compared to fi rice by reducing seepage deep drainage and evaporation losses as the small amounts of irrigation water were applied for every irrigation at 2 3 day interval thus keeping soil drier total amount of irrigation water applied to rice particularly in fi treatments was 124 mm more in the year 2014 compared to 2015 as the rains were fewer in 2014 in 2014 and 2015 irrigation water input in rice was 19 83 mm mean 50 mm and 34 59 mm mean 47 mm more in t5 laterals spaced at 67 5 cm with no mulch when compared with other drip irrigation treatments with residue mulch t1 t3 t4 t6 respectively the decrease in irrigation water input in residue mulch compared to no mulch plots was possibly due to reduction in evaporation losses sharda et al 2017 reported similar water savings in rice under sdf compared to fi due to lower evaporation and drainage losses under sdf effect of lateral depth on irrigation water input in rice was relatively small with 16 20 mm lower water input for 20 cm depth t4 compare to 15 cm depth t3 residue mulch in wheat reduced the irrigation water applied input by 40 7 and 41 9 mm compared to no mulch in 2014 and 2015 respectively fig 5 surface residues are known to reduce evaporation losses and conserve soil moisture thereby crops required less amount of irrigation water in wheat ram et al 2013 like in dsr amount of irrigation water applied to wheat through drip system was 41 9 and 40 3 lower compared with fi in ct 306 mm and zt 298 mm respectively in 2014 15 similar was the trend in 2015 16 with 52 6 and 58 1 lower irrigation amount in drip system compared to fi in ct 356 mm and zt 403 mm fig 5 the drip irrigated crop received water at a shorter interval 2 3 d interval in rice and 8 10 d interval in wheat subject to weather conditions whereas water was applied at a longer interval in the fi rice and wheat more water in fi treatments might contribute to percolation losses beyond the active root zone because the amount of water applied at each irrigation is higher than the soil water storage capacity consistent with the results from our study a number of researchers chen et al 2015 chouhan et al 2015 have reported significant reduction in irrigation water use with drip irrigation system compared to fi wheat by increasing application precision and reducing unneeded losses through drainage and evaporation applications water can be conserved and energy needed for pumping water can be saved in our study effects of spacing and depth of laterals on irrigation water input in wheat with straw mulch were generally small in ssdf system chouhan et al 2015 reported that installing the drip irrigation system at 60 cm lateral and with 30 cm dripper spacing provided uniform moisture distribution in the active root zone in wheat and led to large water saving in clay loam soil further studies are suggested to compute the complete water balance components under ssdf to report real water savings 3 4 irrigation water productivity wpi wpi of rice was significantly higher with residue mulch r and for drip irrigation treatments t1 t6 compared to no mulch r and fi treatments t7 and t8 in both rice seasons fig 6 savings in irrigation water due to reduced evaporation under surface mulch resulted in an increase in wpi over no mulch wpi of dsr in drip irrigation treatments ranged from 0 75 0 84 kg m 3 compared to 0 36 0 46 kg m 3 in fi treatments the findings from this study are consistent with the observations of sharda et al 2017 who reported that drip irrigation in dsr resulted in higher wpi 0 85 0 90 kg m 3 than fi 0 42 0 52 kg m 3 on a sandy loam soil under the similar climatic conditions large irrigation water savings in sdf ssdf compared to flood irrigation with similar or higher crop yields compared to fi resulted in the higher wpi chen et al 2015 since grain yield and irrigation water inputs were generally similar at different spacing and depth of laterals in straw mulch treatments no significant effects were recorded on wpi of rice in both the seasons the wpi of wheat was significantly higher in drip irrigation treatments compared to fi both zt and ct in both years fig 7 wpi in wheat in drip irrigated treatments ranged from 2 61 to 3 84 kg m 3 compared to 1 23 1 70 kg m 3 in fi treatments fig 7 in the drip irrigated wheat both irrigation water savings and increased yields resulted in higher wpi in both the years over fi the wpi in wheat was significantly higher with residue mulch compared to no mulch due to higher grain yield and lower irrigation input in both the seasons fig 7 spacing of laterals at 33 75 cm and 67 5 cm when compared at same depth 15 cm resulted in similar wpi in wheat this study revealed that drip irrigation in dsr has the potential to increase irrigation wpi by matching the water requirement of crop and reducing deep drainage losses and generally keeping soil drier and reducing soil evaporation ayars et al 1999 3 5 partial factor productivity of nitrogen nue described as partial factor productivity of applied n pfpn was significantly affected by drip irrigation and crop establishment of rice and wheat table 4 pfpn in t5 was significantly higher by 30 6 and 9 62 in rice and 33 8 and 52 1 in wheat compared to fi zt and fi ct treatments t7 and t8 respectively table 4 pfpn in rice was significantly higher at 67 5 cm lateral spacing t5 compared to that at 33 75 cm spacing t2 when residues were removed and laterals installed at 15 cm depth the pfpn was significantly higher in all the drip irrigation treatments t1 t6 compared with both ct and zt in fi wheat the results from present study are in contradiction with the observation of sharda et al 2017 who did not find any additional advantage of fertigation in dsr possibly due to high levels of n used in their study the fi zt wheat r t7 had 13 7 higher pfpn compared with fi ct wheat r t8 the pfpn of rice wheat rw system was significantly higher in all the drip irrigated treatments compared with both ct and zt fi wheat both spacing and depth of lateral showed no effect on pfpn in wheat and rw system the higher values of pfpn recoded under ssdf system compared to flood irrigation were mainly due to lower amount of n fertilizer needed to produce similar yields of rice and wheat and in part can be ascribed to higher wheat yields under ssdf system pfpn values differ among crops because they differ in their nutrient and water needs the pfpn were higher for rice than for wheat from an extensive review of 93 published studies ladha et al 2005 reported average values for pfpn were generally higher for rice 62 kg kg 1 n than for wheat 45 kg kg 1 n at least in part due to the higher n content of wheat grain however there is a need to determine the optimum rate and timing of n application under ssdf for both rice and wheat crops 3 6 economic analysis of rice wheat system economic benefit is an important consideration when evaluating crop management practices the results of the current study showed that the variable costs of production in rice and wheat were lower by rs 8 12 11 97 thousand ha 1 and rs 2 62 4 31 thousand ha 1 in ca based drip irrigation treatments t1 t6 than under conventional flood irrigated treatment t8 respectively table 5 the higher variable cost under conventional rw system t8 was primarily due to high labor and fuel cost for land preparation for and high cost for transplanting seedlings in rice similarly higher variable cost in zt flood irrigated rice t7 compared to drip irrigated treatments was due to more cost for irrigation water and labour cost for irrigation application gross returns in rice and wheat were significantly higher for ssdf with laterals spaced at 67 5 cm and laid 15 cm below soil surface t5 compared to treatment with laterals spaced at 33 75 cm and placed at 15 cm t2 and flood irrigated conventional till t8 and flood irrigated zt rice t7 table 5 gross returns gr in ssdf system with laterals spaced at 67 5 cm t5 were significantly higher compared with conventional flood irrigation system t8 due mainly to significantly higher yields of rice and wheat table 5 dripline cost is a large portion of the initial ssdf system cost drip laterals at 67 5 cm and buried at 15 cm or 20 cm depth result in half the number of drip laterals compared with that at 33 75 cm table 2 however in our study dripline spacing t4 vs t6 showed relatively small ca 4 effect on total variable cost because 80 of its cost is subsidized earlier studies in maize camp et al 1997 lamm and trooien 2003 showed that initial installation cost was lower by 30 to 40 when lateral spacing was increased by 100 the highest net returns nr recorded under ssdf system t1 t6 were owing to the combined effect of higher crop productivity with lesser cost of tillage and labour for seeding than the most prevalent conventional system t8 table 5 net returns from rw system from t5 were 10 9 and 29 8 higher compared flood irrigated t7 and t8 treatments respectively in sugarcane sivanappan 1994 reported that net profit of the drip irrigation system was 74 over the profit of the flood irrigation system benefit to cost ratio nr divided by total variable cost for ssdf system ranged from 3 55 to 4 42 compared to 2 55 for conventional rw system t8 the nr and benefit to cost ration from ssdf will still be higher when the subsidy is reduced to 25 from 80 considered in the current economic analysis economic analysis by sharda et al 2016 showed that although net income for surface drip irrigated rice was lower than for flood irrigation there was more than 40 irrigation water saving with the drip system under the similar climatic conditions in punjab india our study demonstrated that drip irrigation in rw system is a potential option for a water scarce future and to cope up with alarming ground water table depletion for example rw system in nw india under such situations the policy planners are exploring alternate options to incentivize farmers for more efficient water uses rather than providing free electricity for pumping for example the government of punjab india is piloting the direct benefit transfer on electricity dbte to farmers rather than free subsidized electricity for pumping water for irrigation to economize the water use in intensive rw system wherein drip irrigation technology will be immensely helpful moreover portfolio of ssdf and ca based management have complementarity from technology application and policy investment incentive perspective further under ssdf the life of drip irrigation system will be doubled due to non movement of the laterals as well as protection from sun etc which not only help farmers to reduce cost but also to governments to save on subsidies incentives on drip irrigation hence drip irrigation system will be an economically as well as ecologically viable alternative under both scenarios of i current subsidy regime on drip irrigation system 80 coupled with free electricity or ii pricing of water pumping no electricity subsidy but incentivizing the water saving technologies in agriculture the latter option will be more promising and futuristic for impact at scale and contribute to sustainable development goals sdgs 4 conclusions our study has provided science based first evidence of using subsurface drip fertigation ssdf system as means of saving precious irrigation water increasing irrigation water productivity and improving n use efficiency in ca based rice wheat rw system zero till with straw mulch in ssdf system further helped in irrigation water saving and increasing wpi over no mulch the dripline lateral spacing of 67 5 cm and a depth of 15 cm were optimum for ssdf in ca based rice wheat production system on silt loam soil in nw india fertigation using subsurface drip irrigation saved 20 of n fertilizer thus increasing n use efficiency compared to flood irrigation we used a single n rate and a fixed 7 day fertigation schedule in this study therefore optimum n rate and fertigation schedule need to be standardized for both rice and wheat crops to further improve yield and nue our results demonstrated that it is possible to further improve rice and wheat productivity irrigation water productivity and n use efficiency with reduced global warming potential by adopting the drip irrigation system coupled with ca in nw india the findings from our study have broader implications for dramatically reducing ground water pumping for irrigation to produce similar or higher yields in rw system in nw india and in other regions of south asia where water table is showing depleting at an alarming rate moreover since energy requirement for pumping of water using drip irrigation sdf or ssdf is 50 lower than that of flood irrigation can be met through solar powered pumps and hence reduces the water footprints significantly moreover the 50 saving in irrigation water by ssdf will contribute to sustainable intensification of rw system the results of our study provides i optimum design of subsurface drip irrigation system for ca based rw system and ii provides novel information and first such evidence useful for the researchers policy planners and farmers acknowledgements the

11121,we assess factors influencing farmers willingness to pay wtp amount for privately installed smallholder irrigation systems in northern ghana that conserve water for farming northern ghana has a unimodal rainfall pattern that last for three months with a prolonged dry season we provide insights into smallholder farmers affordability of simple irrigation systems fashioned on build operate and transfer and how long it would take to breakeven to own the system we add to the largely paucity in the literature in northern ghana on smallholder farmer access to irrigation services primary data and focus group discussions from farmers was collected between november 2015 and july 2016 in communities where the technology is installed as pilots and in areas noted for floods during the single rainy season and drought in the dry season the contingency valuation method was used to elicit information on farmers willingness to pay amount the tobit regression model estimated the key factors that would influence their wtp amount whilst the simple investment appraisal technique payback period estimated the breakeven point the mean wtp amount from the farmers was ghs180 45 per two seasons a year per hectare given this mean willingness to pay amount at baseline the typical group of five 5 maize farmers can afford to pay to own one bit after 22 years of life of the technology that notwithstanding for sustainability of such a project there is the need for strong farmer based groups to operate and manage the bit and for the farmers to access farm inputs access markets and be able to sell their produce at adequate prices to cover costs and to increase their income recommendations directed at ngos extension institutions and local government authorities are to intensify training given to farmers on adoption of irrigation technologies as well as strengthening farmer based organizations for sustainability and management of such technologies keywords water conservation smallholder irrigation privately installed willingness to pay payback period 1 introduction water for agricultural production has become dire in dry and semi arid areas with climatic changes and the need to conserve water for farming has become germane farmers in sub saharan africa are experiencing climatic changes with associated changes in rainfall patterns accompanied by frequent floods and droughts leading to consequences for already vulnerable people in terms of declining crop yields fao 2008 umesh et al 2015 food crop farmers dependence on rainfall for food production has become erratic sometimes with accompanying flooding threatening food security and efforts to combat poverty indeed the scarcity of water for smallholder farmer s crop production is a cause in agriculture s underperformance in sub saharan africa and is one of the main reasons that africa lags behind other regions on most of the millennium development goals mdgs globally irrigation development is seen as key in mitigating climatic change effects on crop production and important in increasing the utilization of the same piece of land several times in a year for land scarce smallholder farm households thus increasing production and productivity to increase incomes and improving livelihoods hasnip et al 2001 provide a comprehensive literature review on the contribution of irrigation to farm households in sustaining rural livelihoods in bangladesh and nepal through the security of increased levels of farm productivity employment and incomes and a fostering of the linkage effects of farm level irrigation development for the local economy and beyond kamwamba mtethiwa et al 2016 and mango et al 2018 all assert to the improvements that smallholder farm irrigation systems impart to farm level crop productivity impart to farmer adaptation to climate variability and in enhancing household food security at the farm level namara et al 2013 discuses the types of irrigation technologies that are used at the smallholder farmer level to include human powered rope and treadle pumps to liquid fuel engine driven systems and solar powered pumps as well as gravity and river diversion methods the fao 2014 provides practical examples of these common irrigation techniques watering cans treadle pumps motorized pumps solar pumps shallow wells canal and pipe conveyance systems sprinkler irrigation systems drip irrigation systems small scale community irrigation systems among others and their cost implications in operations and maintenance to small scale farmers and the key principles and practices for selection and installation the fao 2014 discussions of these common irrigation techniques effectiveness are related to the diverse conditions of climate change soil and water resources availability and the cost implications of installation operation and maintenance the listed cost estimates of some of the common techniques most often excluding operations and maintenance are watering can us 500 ha treadle pumps us 500 ha and labour cost of us 600 ha solar pumps us 10 15 000 ha and most small scale community irrigation systems simple inlet structures us 500 1000 ha to us 4000 6000 ha of standardized quality structures scarcity of water therefore has been a restraining factor for crop production in the drier regions in sub saharan africa including the northern regions of ghana and to address declining food crop productivity water conservation and irrigation management issues needs addressing for sustainable livelihoods irrigated agriculture is important but it is yet to be significant in ghana s agriculture production landscape irrigated agriculture contributes minimally about 0 5 to the country s agricultural production with about 11 000 ha of land from an identifiable irrigable area of 500 000 ha that has been developed for public irrigation albeit highly underutilized as a result of institutional management input and other constraints breisinger et al 2008 namara et al 2011 public investments in irrigation development has declined considerably over the past two decades in ghana until recently but there is an increasing skepticism about the returns to the huge public investment in irrigation development that was witnessed in the 1970s namara et al 2011 meanwhile private sector involvement in irrigation development has been limited and this has given rise to the need to promote private sector involvement in irrigation development and management mofa 2012 water demand in ghana will increase from 40 780 million m3 in 2010 to 42 969 million m3 in 2020 with the main uses for consumption irrigation and livestock rearing superficial water resources are not adequate to meet present and future consumptive water demand wrc 2012 it is important within these challenges that the government of ghana regards and enhances smallholder farmer access to irrigated agricultural infrastructure to increase farm productivity ghana s irrigation policy mofa 2012 addresses private sector involvement in providing irrigated water for agricultural production similarly private public participation ppp arrangements in the agricultural sector also provides opportunities for private sector partnering of the public sector institutions in delivering irrigation services to the agricultural sector adb 2013 the irrigation policy and private sector participation in agriculture are fully aligned with the goals of the governments growth and poverty reduction strategy gprs i ii specifically private sector participation in irrigation was set up to improve the livelihoods and potential irrigators and farmer based organizations ensuring that service providers are given opportunities to perform by opening up investments for expanded and strengthened crop production this makes room for enhanced services that delivers cost effective high irrigation services demand driven to private and public irrigation ghana s economy is dependent on agriculture and its growth is important to total economic growth and development agriculture is fundamental to ghana s economy although its contribution to gross domestic product gdp has been declining 29 9 in 2010 18 9 in 2016 and 18 3 in 2017 it continues to be vital to economic growth as it employs almost 40 of the economically active population sger 2018 the service and the industry sector comprise 50 and 31 7 of gdp respectively with relatively low levels of farm productivity arising from low farm technology uptake and the effects of drought and climate change government policies have been to commit to investing in technologies to protect the agricultural sector weather uncertainties such as droughts floods and extreme temperatures are having adverse impacts on ghana s agriculture worsening food shortages food insecurity and livelihoods to attain the millennium development goals mdgs associated to food security and poverty reduction fao 2008 poverty reduction has become a major global agenda kassie et al 2010 in ghana a large proportion of the rural population rely on agriculture 82 ghana statistical service gss 2016 as their means of livelihood several agricultural strategies are in place to reduce poverty of farmers by increasing productivity of crops including staple crops with a primary objective of linking farmers to markets to increase productivity and income levels for example the ghana shared growth and development agenda gsgda and food and agriculture sector development policy fasdep ii the policy documents of the government of ghana on agriculture focus on using cash crops and food crops as a poverty reduction instrument to increase farmer income in ghana crop productivity expansion is a main concern and staple crops defined in fasdep ii for support are cassava maize rice yam and cowpea smallholder farmers primarily suffer limited access to appropriate inputs for production including irrigation access to enhance crop productivity several irrigation technologies and waterbodies are in northern ghana however these irrigation facilities are limited to specific locations and are not able to reach large number of farmers in remote areas to supplement the needs of the large smallholder farmers there is also the problem of broken irrigation schemes there is therefore the need to enhance the availability of supplementary water for crop farming among smallholder farmers to enhance food security the performance of smallholder farmer s engagement in irrigation water management however has been mixed in ghana with several instances of default payments resulting in stalled public private irrigation initiatives regassa et al 2010 public irrigation initiatives closed down due to breakdown of pumping machine high electricity cost old and choked canals and poor service repayments recent government investments in rehabilitating some existing irrigation schemes has brought some of these irrigated area back to production nonetheless given the poor experiences of public private water management of irrigation services in ghana and the promotion of private sector participation it is important to understand whether smallholder farmers are willing to adopt and pay for tailored privately installed irrigation schemes the bhungroo irrigation technology bit is a private sector led smallholder irrigation system installed in northern ghana and championed by two private entities in ghana conservation alliance in association with international water management institute iwmi the bit was introduced in ghana in 2015 currently three of the bit system is sited on selected farmer s farm as a demonstration to access the patronage and feasibility of the technology in farming communities in the builsa south and west mamprusi districts which are noted for maize rice cowpea and groundnut production but experience severe water logging during the single raining season and prolonged drought in the dry period owusu et al 2017 these demonstration sites were installed in 2015 the principle behind the private irrigation service provision is a build operate and recover cost over 30 years and transfer to group of farmers whilst ensuring farm income increases for the farmers the bit is a water conservation technology that is able to sip large quantities of water from the land surface and store in unsaturated layers in the soils as groundwater biplap 2013 owusu et al 2017 the uniqueness is the ability of the technology to absorb water store and bring back the water for various uses when needed the bit has a capacity to infiltrate as much as 40 000 m3 of water underground with a recovery potential of 8 12 ha irrigable area based on the water stored and crop water requirements owusu et al 2017 the bit is a new irrigation technology that are employed in india by private irrigation service providers to make more farmlands available for agriculture by freeing waterlogged and flooded lands of excess water during the wet season this ensures availability of all year round water for a dual season in a cropping year the bit has been very successful in most parts of india especially in the gujarat state owusu et al 2017 indicates that the bit came to flourish after the serious drought that affected the western indian state of gujarat in 2000 and at the same time flash floods in the region led to waterlogging during the wet season it is estimated that a one bit sunk can free 5 7 acres 2 3 ha of waterlogged land and can irrigate 20 30 acres 8 12 ha conversion from a one time bit installation without maintenance and operational cost about five 5 resource poor farmers in india jointly pay 4930 for 20 25 years for this once in a lifetime installation cost in haryana gujarat india water for irrigation is valued at us 2 50 ha cornish and perry 2003 and charge price ranges from 2 to 8 ha in pakistan which covers part of operational and maintenance costs ahmad 2002 the underground reservoir can hold as much as 40 million litres of rainwater most beneficiary farmers using the technology in india are experiencing at least 150 percent increase in farm productivity the bit adoption in india has had significant positive impacts on agribusinesses and has reduced poverty in bhungroo beneficiary areas by at least 30 percent biplap 2013 although the bit is new in ghana it is a very promising irrigation technology suited to smallholder farmers in ghana given its success in india among smallholder women farmers owusu et al 2017 the borehole success was rated as good 50 65 for two sites and much higher 75 85 for one site owusu et al 2017 and that the borehole yield and the time taken for the bhungroo to recover after the pumping test were good and were within the values known for the study area the bit has the potential to provide smallholder farmers with all year round irrigation for farming maize is a major food and cash crop in the bit catchment areas and has a productivity of about 0 897 tons ha as at 2013 amanor boadu et al 2015 compared to the average 5 6 tons ha potential in northern ghana about 80 per cent of the production of maize is consumed by the production households wiredu et al 2010 and is a commercial crop with the proportion of crop sold to total amount produced of 20 40 amanor boadu et al 2015 the business plan estimates that five 5 smallholder farmers in the study area will collectively pay about 5000 once in a lifetime installation cost of the bit that has a lifespan of 20 25 years such costs could be as high as 10 000 paul et al 2013 cited in owusu et al 2017 for a 30 year lifespan for surface storage and basin infiltration but still estimated to be the lowest of cost effective smallholder installed irrigation systems anticipated also are that farmers in the waterlogged areas of northern ghana who are unable to produce maize on the waterlogged lands during the wet season would adopt the bit services other crops that require adequate or muddy fields will also benefit for crops that do not require muddy fields for cultivation by installing the private irrigation technology on the waterlogged land to inject water underground at the same time lifting the water for periods of severe drought farm productivity could increase in effect the bit will increase food and cash crop of smallholders and thus enhance food security and livelihoods in conserving farmer land and water for irrigation under such situation of waterlogged lands the use of bhungroo irrigation technology is a promising tool it is therefore imperative to understand the demand side constraints for effective adoption of the technology given the increasing threats from climate variability and change the effectiveness of farm level irrigation adoption to sustainably increase productivity and farmer incomes should be paramount can the smallholder farmer in northern ghana pay for the privately installed irrigation technology this paper derives information from the smallholder farmers in the catchment areas of the piloted bit demonstration sites and non piloted catchment areas in northern ghana to address the study question we estimate the mean amount the smallholder farmer is willing to pay wtp for the bit analyze the factors influencing this amount and estimate the payback period for a typical group of farmers to pay for and own the bit we then provide policy directions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in northern ghana in three districts builsa south upper east region and west mamprusi and mamprugu moaduri northern region where agriculture employs majority of the workforce see fig 1 and the bit are championed northern ghana particularly have been designated as the food basket of the nation given the dry condition and the vast landscape for drying cereals and other crops and the potential for increased mechanized farming predominantly an agricultural region northern ghana has one single rainfall regime and lacks sufficient irrigation infrastructure to support dry season farming and have a relatively higher poverty status a major reason attributed to the relatively high poverty status in northern ghana is the single raining season the dry season period tends to be distinct and extended to almost 8 9 months namara et al 2011 this implies that with rain fed agriculture crop farming in northern ghana can be suitable for a period of 3 4 months and cultivation for longer periods as well as double cropping of short gestation crops are risky without irrigation most smallholder farmers in northern ghana who are predominantly rain fed farmers generally remain idle for the greater period of the year and are mainly not involved in other non farm economic activities which worsen their poverty situation or temporarily migrate to southern ghana to engage in other farm cocoa activities many poverty alleviation programs such as small scale irrigation savana agricultural development authority sada amongst others are in northern ghana in an effort to overcome poverty in west mamprusi for example the one irrigation facility the district has is a small undeveloped irrigation facility at nasia maize cowpea and rice doubles as staple grain and cash crops and therefore has implications for food security and poverty reduction in the district however the districts perennial flooding during the wet rainy season and dry land with inadequate access to water source during the dry season make food cultivation a challenge nevertheless maize cowpeas and sorghum does not do well in waterlogged areas and suffers wilting during the dry season due to lack of adequate moisture for growth ajiegbe et al 2010 although some variety of rice can yield heavily when grown in waterlogged lands paddy rice production is not the major crop for the district but maize builsa south district is part of the nine districts in the upper east region which is located south west of the region it is between latitudes 100 15 n and 100 20 n and longitudes 10 05 w and 10 35 w it is to the south by west mamprusi district cereals such as maize rice sorghum millet and pulses such as cowpea and groundnuts are main staple crops in the district the communities are predominantly smallholders who grow an array of rain fed food crops the district falls within the guinea savannah zone the district has a single maximum rainfall regime unimodal expanding over a period of 5 months with annual totals of 700 1 000 mm the climatic condition in the district is tropical and semi arid making the area relatively dry the dry period extends for 7 months with a mean temperature of 25 30 c the west mamprusi district also faces a rainy season that starts in late april with little rainfall rising to its peak in july august and declining sharply thereafter and coming to a complete halt in october november mean annual rainfall ranges between 950mm 1 200 mm the white volta and its tributaries sissili and the kulpawn rivers drain the district there is a yearly flooding caused by overflow of the white volta occasionally flash floods are caused by spilling of waters from the bagre dam further up stream in burkina faso the rainfall and the nature of the underlying rock formations determines to a large extent the ground and surface water potential for the district the present combination of heavy run off high evaporation and transpiration and low infiltration rates to recharge aquifers in some areas in the district contribute to water deficiencies mamprugu moagduri district carved from west mamprusi forms part of the new districts and municipalities created in the year 2012 the district is between longitudes 0 35 w and 1 45 w and latitude 9 55 n and 10 35 n the white volta river and its main tributaries such as sissili and the kulpawn rivers are major drainage in the district there are rivers along large arable land good for the cultivation of rice and other cereals the wet season spans from may to october peaking from july to september when there can be floods the rest of the year is dry with average rainfall between 1000 mm and 1400 mm with an average monthly temperature of about 25 5 c the district is within the savannah climatic belt temperatures are generally high all year round with the hottest month being march 2 2 data and data analysis we used both quantitative and qualitative data in a mixed method approach the quantitative survey using structured questionnaires targeted at farmers at the plot level was undertaken in northern ghana in november december 2015 the qualitative study involved focus group discussions using checklists and conducted separately for male female and youth farmers in july 2016 to validate and triangulate farmer information the survey covered farmer s socio economic characteristics and farm production information in major staple crops maize sorghum rice vegetables and other crops on the willingness to adopt and the willingness to pay amount farmers were asked several single bounded dichotomous choice questions the question was asked if the farmer will be willing to adopt wta and willing to pay wtp for bit water service charge and whether the farmer would pay to use the bit they were asked further to state the amount they will be willing to pay to use the service per unit area for the cropping season if they responded positively to the wtp question the study therefore adopted the contingency valuation method cvm in eliciting the wtp information from the smallholder farmers for the irrigation services for their stated preferences birol et al 2006 since the market for the demand of the bit services has only been provided through installed demonstration units in natural resource extraction environmental goods the empirical economic literature concerns the economic benefit of changes in the levels of use of these resources services deriving from the smallholder irrigation supply was therefore not generally traded in markets in northern ghana and information on market demand and competitive market prices are not available to value benefits the cvm creates a hypothetical market for such services and seeks to elicit the value that farmers attach to them by asking how much they would be prepared or wtp to obtain the benefits of such services the cvm captures both use and non use value attached to the service and more superior than the travel cost and hedonic pricing methods as these only captures used values of the services koundouri et al 2016 the methods for estimating wtp models have encompassed maximum likelihood estimators this paper followed the cvm by explaining to the respondents the nature of the bit the expected cost and benefits including the availability of all year round water for crop cultivation upon the adoption of the technology a multi stage sampling technique was adopted for the study the multi stage procedure was a three stage purposive sampling and stratification approach in the first stage there was the purposive selection of three districts builsa south mamprugu moaduri and west mamprusi in the upper east and northern regions of ghana the irrigation technology are to be installed due to the drought and perennial flooding of communities in these districts the project however purposively sited the demonstration of the bhungroo system based on technical feasibility on initial assessments by soil scientists and hydrogeologist owusu et al 2017 and also on the approval by the community leadership a purposive sample of five 5 farming communities that gets flooded from the three districts were selected in the second stage wiesi gbedembilisi kpasenkpe kubori yagaba and jagsi duu guided by the location of the installed bit two 2 of the farming communities served as control where there were no bit gbedemblisi builsa south and kubori yagaba mamprugu moaduri the third stage involved randomly sampling smallholder farmers growing food crops in the communities stratified by gender the rationale of the stratification was to ensure a representation of male and female farmers the actual selection of respondents was made difficult as a result of the unavailability of a comprehensive list of farmers there were no population figures nor farmer lists in the communities the study provided its own household listing in the field with the help of community leaders for the sampling the survey covered 260 smallholder farmers the bit installed communities are labelled as treatment communities in this paper the 260 sampled respondents are made up of 160 treatment and 100 control farmers the statistical package for social sciences spss software version 16 was employed in analyzing and describing the data by identifying the mean minimum and maximum amount smallholder farmers are willing to pay by age and gender among others the spss was used in describing the distribution in the estimated amount smallholders are willing to pay for the service in the districts the tobit estimation approach following from maddala 1983 was employed in the maximum likelihood estimation approach using stata version 10 to analyze the factors influencing the willingness to pay amount the choice of the tobit model arises because whilst all the respondents were willing to adopt the bit some farmers were not able to indicate how much they will pay hence predicting an outcome that is censored from below the tobit model is expressed as y xi β εi i 1 2 n where n is the number of observations yi is the dependent variable willingness to pay amount to use the bit services per hectare per season xi is a vector of independent variables β is a vector of estimable parameters and εi is a standard normal independently distributed error term the estimated parameters β provide indications of how a one unit change in an independent variable x affect the uncensored observation y the estimated equation is see table 5 for variable definitions and units y β0 β1x1 β2x2 β3x3 β4x4 β5x5 β6x6 β7x7 β8x8 β9x9 β17x17 εi the simple investment appraisal technique the payback period is used in estimating the breakeven point in the irrigation project the payback period expressed in years is the length of time required to recover cost of the bit investment the payback period is calculated by counting the number of years it will take to recover the cash invested in the bit before it becomes the property of the farmer trough the service charges payback period initial investment cash inflow service charges per period the project is acceptable or recommended only if its payback period is less than or equal to the target payback period the qualitative data collected from the focus group discussions validated the information obtained from the quantitative survey of farmers issues discussed were on cropping patterns the extent of their experiences to flooding their willingness to pay for the irrigation services and the amounts they are willing to pay and finally constraints that could inhibit their willingness to pay for the private irrigation service charge in the communities 3 results and discussions 3 1 characteristics of the respondents there are more male 94 than female farmers in the sample see table 1 a this suggests the domination of male farmers in the communities see also alhassan et al 2013 who also had a male proportion of 94 in their sample there are however more youth defined as 15 35 years in ghana s youth policy document than adults in the sample the mean farm size under maize is 2 6 ha the main crops cultivated are maize 75 and cowpea 6 see table 1b communities in the builsa south appear to engage more in maize and cowpea relative to communities in the west mamprusi and mamprugu moaduri who grow more of maize about 42 of the sampled farmers have at least primary education compared to 55 with no education almost all the sampled respondents are married 92 the use of own stored seeds in crop production is pronounced about 89 of respondents and the use of inorganic fertilizers are relatively limited to the use of npk 49 of respondents on the other hand almost half of the farmers do not use any inorganic fertilizers land for farming is mainly family owned 91 and hired labour is predominant in field crop cultivation among maize farmers about 43 hire labour for planting 54 for weeding 40 for harvesting and 55 for transporting crops to the house smallholder farmer perceptions on water use water savings and the advantage they take when fields are flooded suggest that in the midst of the availability of water some farmers become helpless see table 2 whilst in general about 73 of the respondents take advantage of the flooded fields to grow rice and beans about 27 do nothing there are also spatial differences even among the communities that take advantage of the flooding in kubori mamprugu moaduri district and gbedemblisi builsa district almost half of the smallholder farmers are unable to take any advantage of the floods the perception of severe food shortages is high 92 in the districts and are attributed among others to poor harvest due to weather conditions 95 in terms of the use of water saving technologies on their farms only 2 5 of the farmers indicated they practice such the water saving technologies and practices were crop rotation 1 2 mixed cropping with leguminous crops 1 2 and 0 practice for earth bunding stone bunding ridging mulching and cover cropping all the respondents were willing to adopt the irrigation system under the bhungroo however not all the respondents were willing to pay an amount for use of the system on their fields about 19 could not offer any amount perhaps on the belief that the irrigation should be free the median amount respondents in any of the communities were willing to pay to use the bit per year per hectare of two farming season is ghs 100 48 1 of all respondents see table 3 although the mean willingness to pay amount in jagsi duu where a bit is installed is the highest the control communities are relatively more willing to pay higher amounts for the bit use the mean willingness to pay amount wtpa by male respondents was about ghs 186 and about ghs 78 amongst the female respondents with a total mean of ghs 180 see table 4 these responses are consistent with that from the focus group discussion fgd as the male respondents indicated paying much relatively higher amounts than the females in the fgd some communities were prepared to forgo 2 bags 100 kg per bag of maize per the season equivalent to ghs 150 180 at the time of the interview to pay for the bit services the mean willingness to pay amount amongst the youth is ghs 164 9 with a maximum amount of ghs 1500 for the farming seasons the mean willingness to pay amount amongst the adult is ghs 196 9 which is consistent with the responses from the focus group discussions the mean willingness to pay amount in this study of ghs180 ha year us 45 is higher than what other studies report alemayehu 2014 reports the mean wtp amount of smallholder farmers in koga in ethiopia for improved irrigation water of us 6 78 ha year alhassan et al 2013 use cvm for their study in the bontanga irrigation scheme in northern ghana and report a mean wtp ha year of ghs 16 32 us 8 48 zakaria et al 2014 from the same irrigation scheme found a mean wtp amount for improved irrigation service delivery per hectare per season to be ghs 22 92 us 11 92 with a maximum bid of ghs 100 us 52 and the minimum ghs 6 us 3 12 3 2 estimating the magnitudes in the factors influencing farmers willingness to pay amount for bit services and discussion the determinants of smallholder farmers willingness to pay amount for bit services are influenced by several socio economic institutional and community specific factors table 5 presents the definitions and units of measurements of the variables in the regression equation and in table 6 the tobit maximum likelihood estimates of the factors influencing the household s willingness to pay amount corrected for potential heteroscedasticity problems are reported the tobit regression result is evaluated at 1 5 and 10 level of significance the estimated log likelihood of 935 82 shows that the overall model is evaluated as fitting the data well and is statistically significant the likelihood ratio with a chi square value of 145 59 df 20 and a p value of 0 0000 indicates our model as a whole fit significantly better than an empty model out of the explanatory variables comprising of socio economic institutional and community specificity variables twelve variables were statistically significant at least at the 10 level marital status yield of maize crop farm income farmer taking flood advantage member of fbo family land tenure hired labour for harvesting maize cultivating maize crop radio for farm production asset and locations wiese jagduu kpasenkpe thirteen variables age marital status sex severe food shortage farm income access to credit extension contact member of fbo family land tenure hired labour for harvesting maize crop jagduu and radio asset have positive effects on willingness to pay amount for the bit services seven variables primary education maize yield flood advantage hired labour for weeding fertilizer use npk wiese and kpasenkpe community specificities are negative in their effects the need to take advantage of the flood for cultivation variable is negatively related to the willingness to pay amount but significant at the 10 level the negative sign intuitively makes sense as most farmers abandon their fields during the flooding but one would have expected that farmers would be willing to pay more to take advantage of the bit services the study also showed that membership of farmer based organization fbo was significant at 5 with a positive influence on farmer s willingness to pay amount for the bit services the estimated marginal effect of 28 8 indicate that being a member of an fbo will increase the willingness to pay amount for the bit water charge by ghs 29 us 7 3 all other variables held constant this implies that farmers who are part of farmer based groups learn from each other and receive other trainings on acquiring improved technologies and other inputs this is consistent with studies conducted by foster and rosenzweig 1995 and conley and udry 2001 who report positive and significant effects of a farmer s membership to an agricultural association on the adoption of new agricultural technologies in ghana maize as a food crop variety is significant at 5 percent and positively influenced the willingness to pay amount of the bit services the estimated marginal effect of 375 04 indicate that being able to cultivate maize on their plots all year round will increase the willingness to pay amount for the bit water charge by ghs 375 us 94 all other variables held constant the implication we draw is that household respondents that cultivate maize are more likely to participate and pay for the water service charge in the communities this could be due to the expected opportunity to cultivate maize twice in the year to increase productivity ceteris paribus a consequence of freeing the land from flooding for cultivation being married and having access to credit could increase the willingness to pay amount by about ghs 92 us 23 and ghs 140 us 35 respectively the maize yield was negative and statistically significant at 5 this is not consistent with the expectation and the explanation in support that farmers with high expected yield tend to have more interest in paying for bit services than farmers with less expected yield farm income was statistically significant at 5 and consistent with the expected positive effect family land secure land tenure for maize farming was significant 5 and consistent with the expected positive effect farmers on family lands are more likely to adopt the bit and pay for water services the result contradicts the arguments of nimoh et al 2011 who suggested that farmers who farm on family lands are less likely to participate in investing in cocoa insurance the community specificity variables have significant effects on willingness to pay amounts for bit services although their signs in the regression varies jagsi duu which is a bit community was positive and statistically significant at 1 consistent with the expectation in support of farmer responses from the enthusiasm showed in their willingness to pay from the focus group discussion this is also consistent with earlier studies that reported significant but varying signs with the location variables alebel et al 2009 depending on community specific factors 3 3 estimating the payback period and discussion the cost of installing one bit its life span and its expected benefits to farmers and the estimated payback period are presented in table 7 the maximum amount of flooded land that a bit could free for farming is approximately two 2 hectares per flooded area on the other hand the stored water is estimated to irrigate 8 ha per season the estimated payback period is based on the estimated willingness to pay amounts given a mean farmer farm size under maize in the study areas of 2 59 ha and also given that the average farmer is willing to pay a mean amount of 45 ha year it appears that 5 typical smallholder farmers in the bit community could afford to pay and own the bit only after 22 years at the median amount of 25 ha year the payback period can be as long as 40 years with the expected increased income from the adoption of the bit of farmers growing maize the experience in an increased average income per hectare because of efficient irrigation may allow the farmers to pay to recover the cost of the equipment much faster than the baseline estimated periods 4 conclusions the main aim of this paper was to assess smallholder farmers willingness and ability to pay for and own a privately installed smallholder irrigation system the bhungroo irrigation technology bit in northern ghana from our findings all the farmers were willing to adopt the technology the mean willingness to pay amount was ghs 180 45 with a median willingness to pay amount of ghs 100 25 per hectare per year the significant and most influencing factors on the smallholder farmers willingness to pay amount identified were the need to take advantage of the flooding for cultivation membership of an fbo maize as the food crop to intensify under the irrigation scheme and increased farm income farmers need to take advantage of the flood for cultivation is contrary to expectation as one would have expected that farmers would be willing to pay more to take advantage of the bit services membership of farmer based organization increases willingness to pay amount and so is the expectation of those maize farmers who expect opportunity to cultivate maize twice in the year to increase productivity a consequence of freeing the land for cultivation the payback period for the installed irrigation technology is about 22 years at the mean cash flow rates from the smallholder farmers this means the smallholder farmer group can only own fully the facility after 22 years with the expected increased income from the adoption of the bit from farmers growing maize the experience in an increased average income per hectare because of efficient irrigation may allow the farmers to recover the cost of the equipment much faster than the baseline estimated periods this study provides useful insights into smallholder farmers affordability of privately installed irrigation systems fashioned on build operate and transfer in sub saharan africa and how long it would take to break even to own the system it appears from the findings that the installation of the privately installed smallholder irrigation intervention in the various communities to enhance and improve food security may well fit in the farming systems of the communities farmers would pay for the bit if they have relevant information on the perceived benefits that helps the farmer make informed decisions cost of technology need to take advantage of flood land need to be in farmer based organization s amongst others however if farmer based groups do not position well in sourcing for farm inputs and its management there will be poor productivity resulting in low incomes among the smallholder farmers availability of finance to smallholder farmers could enhance their wtp for farm investments in addition water for food crop cultivation is critical in the face of climatic changes that subsidizing such technologies for smallholder farmers must be a priority for development agencies to help improve smallholder farmer s participation in privately installed irrigation water to increase smallholder farmer productivity in ghana farmer capacity building to enhance on farm skills and on how the bit works to enhance their productivity and income is important these notwithstanding for sustainability of such projects there is the need for strong farmer based groups to operate and manage the bit and for the farmers to access farm inputs access markets and be able to sell their produce at adequate prices to cover costs and to increase their income ngos extension institutions and local government authorities must intensify trainings given to farmers on the adoption of irrigation technologies as well as strengthening farmer based organizations for sustainability and management of such technologies public and private sector partnerships ppp to develop infrastructures at community district and regional levels to enhance

11121,we assess factors influencing farmers willingness to pay wtp amount for privately installed smallholder irrigation systems in northern ghana that conserve water for farming northern ghana has a unimodal rainfall pattern that last for three months with a prolonged dry season we provide insights into smallholder farmers affordability of simple irrigation systems fashioned on build operate and transfer and how long it would take to breakeven to own the system we add to the largely paucity in the literature in northern ghana on smallholder farmer access to irrigation services primary data and focus group discussions from farmers was collected between november 2015 and july 2016 in communities where the technology is installed as pilots and in areas noted for floods during the single rainy season and drought in the dry season the contingency valuation method was used to elicit information on farmers willingness to pay amount the tobit regression model estimated the key factors that would influence their wtp amount whilst the simple investment appraisal technique payback period estimated the breakeven point the mean wtp amount from the farmers was ghs180 45 per two seasons a year per hectare given this mean willingness to pay amount at baseline the typical group of five 5 maize farmers can afford to pay to own one bit after 22 years of life of the technology that notwithstanding for sustainability of such a project there is the need for strong farmer based groups to operate and manage the bit and for the farmers to access farm inputs access markets and be able to sell their produce at adequate prices to cover costs and to increase their income recommendations directed at ngos extension institutions and local government authorities are to intensify training given to farmers on adoption of irrigation technologies as well as strengthening farmer based organizations for sustainability and management of such technologies keywords water conservation smallholder irrigation privately installed willingness to pay payback period 1 introduction water for agricultural production has become dire in dry and semi arid areas with climatic changes and the need to conserve water for farming has become germane farmers in sub saharan africa are experiencing climatic changes with associated changes in rainfall patterns accompanied by frequent floods and droughts leading to consequences for already vulnerable people in terms of declining crop yields fao 2008 umesh et al 2015 food crop farmers dependence on rainfall for food production has become erratic sometimes with accompanying flooding threatening food security and efforts to combat poverty indeed the scarcity of water for smallholder farmer s crop production is a cause in agriculture s underperformance in sub saharan africa and is one of the main reasons that africa lags behind other regions on most of the millennium development goals mdgs globally irrigation development is seen as key in mitigating climatic change effects on crop production and important in increasing the utilization of the same piece of land several times in a year for land scarce smallholder farm households thus increasing production and productivity to increase incomes and improving livelihoods hasnip et al 2001 provide a comprehensive literature review on the contribution of irrigation to farm households in sustaining rural livelihoods in bangladesh and nepal through the security of increased levels of farm productivity employment and incomes and a fostering of the linkage effects of farm level irrigation development for the local economy and beyond kamwamba mtethiwa et al 2016 and mango et al 2018 all assert to the improvements that smallholder farm irrigation systems impart to farm level crop productivity impart to farmer adaptation to climate variability and in enhancing household food security at the farm level namara et al 2013 discuses the types of irrigation technologies that are used at the smallholder farmer level to include human powered rope and treadle pumps to liquid fuel engine driven systems and solar powered pumps as well as gravity and river diversion methods the fao 2014 provides practical examples of these common irrigation techniques watering cans treadle pumps motorized pumps solar pumps shallow wells canal and pipe conveyance systems sprinkler irrigation systems drip irrigation systems small scale community irrigation systems among others and their cost implications in operations and maintenance to small scale farmers and the key principles and practices for selection and installation the fao 2014 discussions of these common irrigation techniques effectiveness are related to the diverse conditions of climate change soil and water resources availability and the cost implications of installation operation and maintenance the listed cost estimates of some of the common techniques most often excluding operations and maintenance are watering can us 500 ha treadle pumps us 500 ha and labour cost of us 600 ha solar pumps us 10 15 000 ha and most small scale community irrigation systems simple inlet structures us 500 1000 ha to us 4000 6000 ha of standardized quality structures scarcity of water therefore has been a restraining factor for crop production in the drier regions in sub saharan africa including the northern regions of ghana and to address declining food crop productivity water conservation and irrigation management issues needs addressing for sustainable livelihoods irrigated agriculture is important but it is yet to be significant in ghana s agriculture production landscape irrigated agriculture contributes minimally about 0 5 to the country s agricultural production with about 11 000 ha of land from an identifiable irrigable area of 500 000 ha that has been developed for public irrigation albeit highly underutilized as a result of institutional management input and other constraints breisinger et al 2008 namara et al 2011 public investments in irrigation development has declined considerably over the past two decades in ghana until recently but there is an increasing skepticism about the returns to the huge public investment in irrigation development that was witnessed in the 1970s namara et al 2011 meanwhile private sector involvement in irrigation development has been limited and this has given rise to the need to promote private sector involvement in irrigation development and management mofa 2012 water demand in ghana will increase from 40 780 million m3 in 2010 to 42 969 million m3 in 2020 with the main uses for consumption irrigation and livestock rearing superficial water resources are not adequate to meet present and future consumptive water demand wrc 2012 it is important within these challenges that the government of ghana regards and enhances smallholder farmer access to irrigated agricultural infrastructure to increase farm productivity ghana s irrigation policy mofa 2012 addresses private sector involvement in providing irrigated water for agricultural production similarly private public participation ppp arrangements in the agricultural sector also provides opportunities for private sector partnering of the public sector institutions in delivering irrigation services to the agricultural sector adb 2013 the irrigation policy and private sector participation in agriculture are fully aligned with the goals of the governments growth and poverty reduction strategy gprs i ii specifically private sector participation in irrigation was set up to improve the livelihoods and potential irrigators and farmer based organizations ensuring that service providers are given opportunities to perform by opening up investments for expanded and strengthened crop production this makes room for enhanced services that delivers cost effective high irrigation services demand driven to private and public irrigation ghana s economy is dependent on agriculture and its growth is important to total economic growth and development agriculture is fundamental to ghana s economy although its contribution to gross domestic product gdp has been declining 29 9 in 2010 18 9 in 2016 and 18 3 in 2017 it continues to be vital to economic growth as it employs almost 40 of the economically active population sger 2018 the service and the industry sector comprise 50 and 31 7 of gdp respectively with relatively low levels of farm productivity arising from low farm technology uptake and the effects of drought and climate change government policies have been to commit to investing in technologies to protect the agricultural sector weather uncertainties such as droughts floods and extreme temperatures are having adverse impacts on ghana s agriculture worsening food shortages food insecurity and livelihoods to attain the millennium development goals mdgs associated to food security and poverty reduction fao 2008 poverty reduction has become a major global agenda kassie et al 2010 in ghana a large proportion of the rural population rely on agriculture 82 ghana statistical service gss 2016 as their means of livelihood several agricultural strategies are in place to reduce poverty of farmers by increasing productivity of crops including staple crops with a primary objective of linking farmers to markets to increase productivity and income levels for example the ghana shared growth and development agenda gsgda and food and agriculture sector development policy fasdep ii the policy documents of the government of ghana on agriculture focus on using cash crops and food crops as a poverty reduction instrument to increase farmer income in ghana crop productivity expansion is a main concern and staple crops defined in fasdep ii for support are cassava maize rice yam and cowpea smallholder farmers primarily suffer limited access to appropriate inputs for production including irrigation access to enhance crop productivity several irrigation technologies and waterbodies are in northern ghana however these irrigation facilities are limited to specific locations and are not able to reach large number of farmers in remote areas to supplement the needs of the large smallholder farmers there is also the problem of broken irrigation schemes there is therefore the need to enhance the availability of supplementary water for crop farming among smallholder farmers to enhance food security the performance of smallholder farmer s engagement in irrigation water management however has been mixed in ghana with several instances of default payments resulting in stalled public private irrigation initiatives regassa et al 2010 public irrigation initiatives closed down due to breakdown of pumping machine high electricity cost old and choked canals and poor service repayments recent government investments in rehabilitating some existing irrigation schemes has brought some of these irrigated area back to production nonetheless given the poor experiences of public private water management of irrigation services in ghana and the promotion of private sector participation it is important to understand whether smallholder farmers are willing to adopt and pay for tailored privately installed irrigation schemes the bhungroo irrigation technology bit is a private sector led smallholder irrigation system installed in northern ghana and championed by two private entities in ghana conservation alliance in association with international water management institute iwmi the bit was introduced in ghana in 2015 currently three of the bit system is sited on selected farmer s farm as a demonstration to access the patronage and feasibility of the technology in farming communities in the builsa south and west mamprusi districts which are noted for maize rice cowpea and groundnut production but experience severe water logging during the single raining season and prolonged drought in the dry period owusu et al 2017 these demonstration sites were installed in 2015 the principle behind the private irrigation service provision is a build operate and recover cost over 30 years and transfer to group of farmers whilst ensuring farm income increases for the farmers the bit is a water conservation technology that is able to sip large quantities of water from the land surface and store in unsaturated layers in the soils as groundwater biplap 2013 owusu et al 2017 the uniqueness is the ability of the technology to absorb water store and bring back the water for various uses when needed the bit has a capacity to infiltrate as much as 40 000 m3 of water underground with a recovery potential of 8 12 ha irrigable area based on the water stored and crop water requirements owusu et al 2017 the bit is a new irrigation technology that are employed in india by private irrigation service providers to make more farmlands available for agriculture by freeing waterlogged and flooded lands of excess water during the wet season this ensures availability of all year round water for a dual season in a cropping year the bit has been very successful in most parts of india especially in the gujarat state owusu et al 2017 indicates that the bit came to flourish after the serious drought that affected the western indian state of gujarat in 2000 and at the same time flash floods in the region led to waterlogging during the wet season it is estimated that a one bit sunk can free 5 7 acres 2 3 ha of waterlogged land and can irrigate 20 30 acres 8 12 ha conversion from a one time bit installation without maintenance and operational cost about five 5 resource poor farmers in india jointly pay 4930 for 20 25 years for this once in a lifetime installation cost in haryana gujarat india water for irrigation is valued at us 2 50 ha cornish and perry 2003 and charge price ranges from 2 to 8 ha in pakistan which covers part of operational and maintenance costs ahmad 2002 the underground reservoir can hold as much as 40 million litres of rainwater most beneficiary farmers using the technology in india are experiencing at least 150 percent increase in farm productivity the bit adoption in india has had significant positive impacts on agribusinesses and has reduced poverty in bhungroo beneficiary areas by at least 30 percent biplap 2013 although the bit is new in ghana it is a very promising irrigation technology suited to smallholder farmers in ghana given its success in india among smallholder women farmers owusu et al 2017 the borehole success was rated as good 50 65 for two sites and much higher 75 85 for one site owusu et al 2017 and that the borehole yield and the time taken for the bhungroo to recover after the pumping test were good and were within the values known for the study area the bit has the potential to provide smallholder farmers with all year round irrigation for farming maize is a major food and cash crop in the bit catchment areas and has a productivity of about 0 897 tons ha as at 2013 amanor boadu et al 2015 compared to the average 5 6 tons ha potential in northern ghana about 80 per cent of the production of maize is consumed by the production households wiredu et al 2010 and is a commercial crop with the proportion of crop sold to total amount produced of 20 40 amanor boadu et al 2015 the business plan estimates that five 5 smallholder farmers in the study area will collectively pay about 5000 once in a lifetime installation cost of the bit that has a lifespan of 20 25 years such costs could be as high as 10 000 paul et al 2013 cited in owusu et al 2017 for a 30 year lifespan for surface storage and basin infiltration but still estimated to be the lowest of cost effective smallholder installed irrigation systems anticipated also are that farmers in the waterlogged areas of northern ghana who are unable to produce maize on the waterlogged lands during the wet season would adopt the bit services other crops that require adequate or muddy fields will also benefit for crops that do not require muddy fields for cultivation by installing the private irrigation technology on the waterlogged land to inject water underground at the same time lifting the water for periods of severe drought farm productivity could increase in effect the bit will increase food and cash crop of smallholders and thus enhance food security and livelihoods in conserving farmer land and water for irrigation under such situation of waterlogged lands the use of bhungroo irrigation technology is a promising tool it is therefore imperative to understand the demand side constraints for effective adoption of the technology given the increasing threats from climate variability and change the effectiveness of farm level irrigation adoption to sustainably increase productivity and farmer incomes should be paramount can the smallholder farmer in northern ghana pay for the privately installed irrigation technology this paper derives information from the smallholder farmers in the catchment areas of the piloted bit demonstration sites and non piloted catchment areas in northern ghana to address the study question we estimate the mean amount the smallholder farmer is willing to pay wtp for the bit analyze the factors influencing this amount and estimate the payback period for a typical group of farmers to pay for and own the bit we then provide policy directions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in northern ghana in three districts builsa south upper east region and west mamprusi and mamprugu moaduri northern region where agriculture employs majority of the workforce see fig 1 and the bit are championed northern ghana particularly have been designated as the food basket of the nation given the dry condition and the vast landscape for drying cereals and other crops and the potential for increased mechanized farming predominantly an agricultural region northern ghana has one single rainfall regime and lacks sufficient irrigation infrastructure to support dry season farming and have a relatively higher poverty status a major reason attributed to the relatively high poverty status in northern ghana is the single raining season the dry season period tends to be distinct and extended to almost 8 9 months namara et al 2011 this implies that with rain fed agriculture crop farming in northern ghana can be suitable for a period of 3 4 months and cultivation for longer periods as well as double cropping of short gestation crops are risky without irrigation most smallholder farmers in northern ghana who are predominantly rain fed farmers generally remain idle for the greater period of the year and are mainly not involved in other non farm economic activities which worsen their poverty situation or temporarily migrate to southern ghana to engage in other farm cocoa activities many poverty alleviation programs such as small scale irrigation savana agricultural development authority sada amongst others are in northern ghana in an effort to overcome poverty in west mamprusi for example the one irrigation facility the district has is a small undeveloped irrigation facility at nasia maize cowpea and rice doubles as staple grain and cash crops and therefore has implications for food security and poverty reduction in the district however the districts perennial flooding during the wet rainy season and dry land with inadequate access to water source during the dry season make food cultivation a challenge nevertheless maize cowpeas and sorghum does not do well in waterlogged areas and suffers wilting during the dry season due to lack of adequate moisture for growth ajiegbe et al 2010 although some variety of rice can yield heavily when grown in waterlogged lands paddy rice production is not the major crop for the district but maize builsa south district is part of the nine districts in the upper east region which is located south west of the region it is between latitudes 100 15 n and 100 20 n and longitudes 10 05 w and 10 35 w it is to the south by west mamprusi district cereals such as maize rice sorghum millet and pulses such as cowpea and groundnuts are main staple crops in the district the communities are predominantly smallholders who grow an array of rain fed food crops the district falls within the guinea savannah zone the district has a single maximum rainfall regime unimodal expanding over a period of 5 months with annual totals of 700 1 000 mm the climatic condition in the district is tropical and semi arid making the area relatively dry the dry period extends for 7 months with a mean temperature of 25 30 c the west mamprusi district also faces a rainy season that starts in late april with little rainfall rising to its peak in july august and declining sharply thereafter and coming to a complete halt in october november mean annual rainfall ranges between 950mm 1 200 mm the white volta and its tributaries sissili and the kulpawn rivers drain the district there is a yearly flooding caused by overflow of the white volta occasionally flash floods are caused by spilling of waters from the bagre dam further up stream in burkina faso the rainfall and the nature of the underlying rock formations determines to a large extent the ground and surface water potential for the district the present combination of heavy run off high evaporation and transpiration and low infiltration rates to recharge aquifers in some areas in the district contribute to water deficiencies mamprugu moagduri district carved from west mamprusi forms part of the new districts and municipalities created in the year 2012 the district is between longitudes 0 35 w and 1 45 w and latitude 9 55 n and 10 35 n the white volta river and its main tributaries such as sissili and the kulpawn rivers are major drainage in the district there are rivers along large arable land good for the cultivation of rice and other cereals the wet season spans from may to october peaking from july to september when there can be floods the rest of the year is dry with average rainfall between 1000 mm and 1400 mm with an average monthly temperature of about 25 5 c the district is within the savannah climatic belt temperatures are generally high all year round with the hottest month being march 2 2 data and data analysis we used both quantitative and qualitative data in a mixed method approach the quantitative survey using structured questionnaires targeted at farmers at the plot level was undertaken in northern ghana in november december 2015 the qualitative study involved focus group discussions using checklists and conducted separately for male female and youth farmers in july 2016 to validate and triangulate farmer information the survey covered farmer s socio economic characteristics and farm production information in major staple crops maize sorghum rice vegetables and other crops on the willingness to adopt and the willingness to pay amount farmers were asked several single bounded dichotomous choice questions the question was asked if the farmer will be willing to adopt wta and willing to pay wtp for bit water service charge and whether the farmer would pay to use the bit they were asked further to state the amount they will be willing to pay to use the service per unit area for the cropping season if they responded positively to the wtp question the study therefore adopted the contingency valuation method cvm in eliciting the wtp information from the smallholder farmers for the irrigation services for their stated preferences birol et al 2006 since the market for the demand of the bit services has only been provided through installed demonstration units in natural resource extraction environmental goods the empirical economic literature concerns the economic benefit of changes in the levels of use of these resources services deriving from the smallholder irrigation supply was therefore not generally traded in markets in northern ghana and information on market demand and competitive market prices are not available to value benefits the cvm creates a hypothetical market for such services and seeks to elicit the value that farmers attach to them by asking how much they would be prepared or wtp to obtain the benefits of such services the cvm captures both use and non use value attached to the service and more superior than the travel cost and hedonic pricing methods as these only captures used values of the services koundouri et al 2016 the methods for estimating wtp models have encompassed maximum likelihood estimators this paper followed the cvm by explaining to the respondents the nature of the bit the expected cost and benefits including the availability of all year round water for crop cultivation upon the adoption of the technology a multi stage sampling technique was adopted for the study the multi stage procedure was a three stage purposive sampling and stratification approach in the first stage there was the purposive selection of three districts builsa south mamprugu moaduri and west mamprusi in the upper east and northern regions of ghana the irrigation technology are to be installed due to the drought and perennial flooding of communities in these districts the project however purposively sited the demonstration of the bhungroo system based on technical feasibility on initial assessments by soil scientists and hydrogeologist owusu et al 2017 and also on the approval by the community leadership a purposive sample of five 5 farming communities that gets flooded from the three districts were selected in the second stage wiesi gbedembilisi kpasenkpe kubori yagaba and jagsi duu guided by the location of the installed bit two 2 of the farming communities served as control where there were no bit gbedemblisi builsa south and kubori yagaba mamprugu moaduri the third stage involved randomly sampling smallholder farmers growing food crops in the communities stratified by gender the rationale of the stratification was to ensure a representation of male and female farmers the actual selection of respondents was made difficult as a result of the unavailability of a comprehensive list of farmers there were no population figures nor farmer lists in the communities the study provided its own household listing in the field with the help of community leaders for the sampling the survey covered 260 smallholder farmers the bit installed communities are labelled as treatment communities in this paper the 260 sampled respondents are made up of 160 treatment and 100 control farmers the statistical package for social sciences spss software version 16 was employed in analyzing and describing the data by identifying the mean minimum and maximum amount smallholder farmers are willing to pay by age and gender among others the spss was used in describing the distribution in the estimated amount smallholders are willing to pay for the service in the districts the tobit estimation approach following from maddala 1983 was employed in the maximum likelihood estimation approach using stata version 10 to analyze the factors influencing the willingness to pay amount the choice of the tobit model arises because whilst all the respondents were willing to adopt the bit some farmers were not able to indicate how much they will pay hence predicting an outcome that is censored from below the tobit model is expressed as y xi β εi i 1 2 n where n is the number of observations yi is the dependent variable willingness to pay amount to use the bit services per hectare per season xi is a vector of independent variables β is a vector of estimable parameters and εi is a standard normal independently distributed error term the estimated parameters β provide indications of how a one unit change in an independent variable x affect the uncensored observation y the estimated equation is see table 5 for variable definitions and units y β0 β1x1 β2x2 β3x3 β4x4 β5x5 β6x6 β7x7 β8x8 β9x9 β17x17 εi the simple investment appraisal technique the payback period is used in estimating the breakeven point in the irrigation project the payback period expressed in years is the length of time required to recover cost of the bit investment the payback period is calculated by counting the number of years it will take to recover the cash invested in the bit before it becomes the property of the farmer trough the service charges payback period initial investment cash inflow service charges per period the project is acceptable or recommended only if its payback period is less than or equal to the target payback period the qualitative data collected from the focus group discussions validated the information obtained from the quantitative survey of farmers issues discussed were on cropping patterns the extent of their experiences to flooding their willingness to pay for the irrigation services and the amounts they are willing to pay and finally constraints that could inhibit their willingness to pay for the private irrigation service charge in the communities 3 results and discussions 3 1 characteristics of the respondents there are more male 94 than female farmers in the sample see table 1 a this suggests the domination of male farmers in the communities see also alhassan et al 2013 who also had a male proportion of 94 in their sample there are however more youth defined as 15 35 years in ghana s youth policy document than adults in the sample the mean farm size under maize is 2 6 ha the main crops cultivated are maize 75 and cowpea 6 see table 1b communities in the builsa south appear to engage more in maize and cowpea relative to communities in the west mamprusi and mamprugu moaduri who grow more of maize about 42 of the sampled farmers have at least primary education compared to 55 with no education almost all the sampled respondents are married 92 the use of own stored seeds in crop production is pronounced about 89 of respondents and the use of inorganic fertilizers are relatively limited to the use of npk 49 of respondents on the other hand almost half of the farmers do not use any inorganic fertilizers land for farming is mainly family owned 91 and hired labour is predominant in field crop cultivation among maize farmers about 43 hire labour for planting 54 for weeding 40 for harvesting and 55 for transporting crops to the house smallholder farmer perceptions on water use water savings and the advantage they take when fields are flooded suggest that in the midst of the availability of water some farmers become helpless see table 2 whilst in general about 73 of the respondents take advantage of the flooded fields to grow rice and beans about 27 do nothing there are also spatial differences even among the communities that take advantage of the flooding in kubori mamprugu moaduri district and gbedemblisi builsa district almost half of the smallholder farmers are unable to take any advantage of the floods the perception of severe food shortages is high 92 in the districts and are attributed among others to poor harvest due to weather conditions 95 in terms of the use of water saving technologies on their farms only 2 5 of the farmers indicated they practice such the water saving technologies and practices were crop rotation 1 2 mixed cropping with leguminous crops 1 2 and 0 practice for earth bunding stone bunding ridging mulching and cover cropping all the respondents were willing to adopt the irrigation system under the bhungroo however not all the respondents were willing to pay an amount for use of the system on their fields about 19 could not offer any amount perhaps on the belief that the irrigation should be free the median amount respondents in any of the communities were willing to pay to use the bit per year per hectare of two farming season is ghs 100 48 1 of all respondents see table 3 although the mean willingness to pay amount in jagsi duu where a bit is installed is the highest the control communities are relatively more willing to pay higher amounts for the bit use the mean willingness to pay amount wtpa by male respondents was about ghs 186 and about ghs 78 amongst the female respondents with a total mean of ghs 180 see table 4 these responses are consistent with that from the focus group discussion fgd as the male respondents indicated paying much relatively higher amounts than the females in the fgd some communities were prepared to forgo 2 bags 100 kg per bag of maize per the season equivalent to ghs 150 180 at the time of the interview to pay for the bit services the mean willingness to pay amount amongst the youth is ghs 164 9 with a maximum amount of ghs 1500 for the farming seasons the mean willingness to pay amount amongst the adult is ghs 196 9 which is consistent with the responses from the focus group discussions the mean willingness to pay amount in this study of ghs180 ha year us 45 is higher than what other studies report alemayehu 2014 reports the mean wtp amount of smallholder farmers in koga in ethiopia for improved irrigation water of us 6 78 ha year alhassan et al 2013 use cvm for their study in the bontanga irrigation scheme in northern ghana and report a mean wtp ha year of ghs 16 32 us 8 48 zakaria et al 2014 from the same irrigation scheme found a mean wtp amount for improved irrigation service delivery per hectare per season to be ghs 22 92 us 11 92 with a maximum bid of ghs 100 us 52 and the minimum ghs 6 us 3 12 3 2 estimating the magnitudes in the factors influencing farmers willingness to pay amount for bit services and discussion the determinants of smallholder farmers willingness to pay amount for bit services are influenced by several socio economic institutional and community specific factors table 5 presents the definitions and units of measurements of the variables in the regression equation and in table 6 the tobit maximum likelihood estimates of the factors influencing the household s willingness to pay amount corrected for potential heteroscedasticity problems are reported the tobit regression result is evaluated at 1 5 and 10 level of significance the estimated log likelihood of 935 82 shows that the overall model is evaluated as fitting the data well and is statistically significant the likelihood ratio with a chi square value of 145 59 df 20 and a p value of 0 0000 indicates our model as a whole fit significantly better than an empty model out of the explanatory variables comprising of socio economic institutional and community specificity variables twelve variables were statistically significant at least at the 10 level marital status yield of maize crop farm income farmer taking flood advantage member of fbo family land tenure hired labour for harvesting maize cultivating maize crop radio for farm production asset and locations wiese jagduu kpasenkpe thirteen variables age marital status sex severe food shortage farm income access to credit extension contact member of fbo family land tenure hired labour for harvesting maize crop jagduu and radio asset have positive effects on willingness to pay amount for the bit services seven variables primary education maize yield flood advantage hired labour for weeding fertilizer use npk wiese and kpasenkpe community specificities are negative in their effects the need to take advantage of the flood for cultivation variable is negatively related to the willingness to pay amount but significant at the 10 level the negative sign intuitively makes sense as most farmers abandon their fields during the flooding but one would have expected that farmers would be willing to pay more to take advantage of the bit services the study also showed that membership of farmer based organization fbo was significant at 5 with a positive influence on farmer s willingness to pay amount for the bit services the estimated marginal effect of 28 8 indicate that being a member of an fbo will increase the willingness to pay amount for the bit water charge by ghs 29 us 7 3 all other variables held constant this implies that farmers who are part of farmer based groups learn from each other and receive other trainings on acquiring improved technologies and other inputs this is consistent with studies conducted by foster and rosenzweig 1995 and conley and udry 2001 who report positive and significant effects of a farmer s membership to an agricultural association on the adoption of new agricultural technologies in ghana maize as a food crop variety is significant at 5 percent and positively influenced the willingness to pay amount of the bit services the estimated marginal effect of 375 04 indicate that being able to cultivate maize on their plots all year round will increase the willingness to pay amount for the bit water charge by ghs 375 us 94 all other variables held constant the implication we draw is that household respondents that cultivate maize are more likely to participate and pay for the water service charge in the communities this could be due to the expected opportunity to cultivate maize twice in the year to increase productivity ceteris paribus a consequence of freeing the land from flooding for cultivation being married and having access to credit could increase the willingness to pay amount by about ghs 92 us 23 and ghs 140 us 35 respectively the maize yield was negative and statistically significant at 5 this is not consistent with the expectation and the explanation in support that farmers with high expected yield tend to have more interest in paying for bit services than farmers with less expected yield farm income was statistically significant at 5 and consistent with the expected positive effect family land secure land tenure for maize farming was significant 5 and consistent with the expected positive effect farmers on family lands are more likely to adopt the bit and pay for water services the result contradicts the arguments of nimoh et al 2011 who suggested that farmers who farm on family lands are less likely to participate in investing in cocoa insurance the community specificity variables have significant effects on willingness to pay amounts for bit services although their signs in the regression varies jagsi duu which is a bit community was positive and statistically significant at 1 consistent with the expectation in support of farmer responses from the enthusiasm showed in their willingness to pay from the focus group discussion this is also consistent with earlier studies that reported significant but varying signs with the location variables alebel et al 2009 depending on community specific factors 3 3 estimating the payback period and discussion the cost of installing one bit its life span and its expected benefits to farmers and the estimated payback period are presented in table 7 the maximum amount of flooded land that a bit could free for farming is approximately two 2 hectares per flooded area on the other hand the stored water is estimated to irrigate 8 ha per season the estimated payback period is based on the estimated willingness to pay amounts given a mean farmer farm size under maize in the study areas of 2 59 ha and also given that the average farmer is willing to pay a mean amount of 45 ha year it appears that 5 typical smallholder farmers in the bit community could afford to pay and own the bit only after 22 years at the median amount of 25 ha year the payback period can be as long as 40 years with the expected increased income from the adoption of the bit of farmers growing maize the experience in an increased average income per hectare because of efficient irrigation may allow the farmers to pay to recover the cost of the equipment much faster than the baseline estimated periods 4 conclusions the main aim of this paper was to assess smallholder farmers willingness and ability to pay for and own a privately installed smallholder irrigation system the bhungroo irrigation technology bit in northern ghana from our findings all the farmers were willing to adopt the technology the mean willingness to pay amount was ghs 180 45 with a median willingness to pay amount of ghs 100 25 per hectare per year the significant and most influencing factors on the smallholder farmers willingness to pay amount identified were the need to take advantage of the flooding for cultivation membership of an fbo maize as the food crop to intensify under the irrigation scheme and increased farm income farmers need to take advantage of the flood for cultivation is contrary to expectation as one would have expected that farmers would be willing to pay more to take advantage of the bit services membership of farmer based organization increases willingness to pay amount and so is the expectation of those maize farmers who expect opportunity to cultivate maize twice in the year to increase productivity a consequence of freeing the land for cultivation the payback period for the installed irrigation technology is about 22 years at the mean cash flow rates from the smallholder farmers this means the smallholder farmer group can only own fully the facility after 22 years with the expected increased income from the adoption of the bit from farmers growing maize the experience in an increased average income per hectare because of efficient irrigation may allow the farmers to recover the cost of the equipment much faster than the baseline estimated periods this study provides useful insights into smallholder farmers affordability of privately installed irrigation systems fashioned on build operate and transfer in sub saharan africa and how long it would take to break even to own the system it appears from the findings that the installation of the privately installed smallholder irrigation intervention in the various communities to enhance and improve food security may well fit in the farming systems of the communities farmers would pay for the bit if they have relevant information on the perceived benefits that helps the farmer make informed decisions cost of technology need to take advantage of flood land need to be in farmer based organization s amongst others however if farmer based groups do not position well in sourcing for farm inputs and its management there will be poor productivity resulting in low incomes among the smallholder farmers availability of finance to smallholder farmers could enhance their wtp for farm investments in addition water for food crop cultivation is critical in the face of climatic changes that subsidizing such technologies for smallholder farmers must be a priority for development agencies to help improve smallholder farmer s participation in privately installed irrigation water to increase smallholder farmer productivity in ghana farmer capacity building to enhance on farm skills and on how the bit works to enhance their productivity and income is important these notwithstanding for sustainability of such projects there is the need for strong farmer based groups to operate and manage the bit and for the farmers to access farm inputs access markets and be able to sell their produce at adequate prices to cover costs and to increase their income ngos extension institutions and local government authorities must intensify trainings given to farmers on the adoption of irrigation technologies as well as strengthening farmer based organizations for sustainability and management of such technologies public and private sector partnerships ppp to develop infrastructures at community district and regional levels to enhance farmer productivity are necessary acknowledgments financial support was provided by the international water management institute water lands and ecosystems wle program ghana project number v7 volta

11122,nitrogen n and irrigation can be two of the costliest management inputs in united states u s cotton gossypium hirsutum l production systems furthermore input amounts are often dependent on yearly environmental conditions making it challenging to optimize n and irrigation management the objectives of this research were to determine optimal n and irrigation management by i evaluating

crop measurements consisting of spad chlorophyll content leaf area index lai n uptake and harvest index hi were conducted at the citra site contrasting soil textures and weather conditions between research locations and years allowed for a comprehensive assessment of both n and irrigation management across varying environmental conditions lint yield was either increased or at least maintained during the two years of this research at the citra location by making two split n applications at first square and bloom of n22 while the optimal n treatment at the jay location was n34 at first square and bloom in both years of this research additionally a yield reduction occurred in the dry year of 2016 at the citra location when n45 was applied at first square and bloom the most efficient irrigation strategy at the citra location was the primed acclimation treatment at the jay location the rf control had similar lint yields as the irrigated treatments in both years indicating that

introduction nitrogen is the most important applied nutrient in cotton production systems due to the potential of increasing lint yields with increasing n rates muharam et al 2014 the possible economic gain by increasing n applications has led to many studies aimed at quantifying the n requirement per unit of lint produced resulting in estimates ranging from 10 to 29 kg n 100 kg 1 lint across global cotton production regions miley and oosterhuis 1989 gerik et al 1998 typical n application rates in the cotton production regions of the united states u s differ widely with reported ranges from 71 to 220 kg n ha 1 taylor 1995 a major factor adding to the complexity of determining optimal n application strategies is n loss through no3 leaching and denitrification both of which are heavily influenced by unpredictable seasonal environmental conditions and soil texture using in season n applications that split the total n applied into percentages applied at varying developmental stages is a management strategy that attempts to increase n efficiency by synchronizing soil n concentrations to plant n demand cotton n accumulation is non linear with an exponential increase reported to begin at first square reaching peak accumulation rates at approximately early to mid bloom the developmental stage that accounts for up to 23 45 of the total n accumulation armstrong and albert 1931 olson and bledsoe 1942 bassett et al 1970 halevy 1976 oosterhuis et al 1983 halevy et al 1987 mullins and burmester 1991 furthermore n accumulation in the seeds and lint account for up to 43 60 of the total plant n resulting in a significant amount of n accumulated in vegetative biomass during peak accumulation being remobilized relatively late in the growing season mullins and burmester 2010 due to this late season n demand several studies have reported lint yield increases by utilizing in season n applications until the phenological stage characterized by peak bloom geng et al 2015 yang et al 2011 these positive yield results may be a result of maintaining a sufficient level of n in plant vegetative biomass to serve as an n source to reproductive structures however the benefits of split n application are not always consistent some reports have observed declines in maximal obtainable lint yields when comparing split n applications of 50 at pre plant and first square to yields obtained by applying 100 pre plant n when utilizing n rates up to 180 kg n ha 1 reiter et al 2008 research conducted by constable and rochester 1988 showed that n recovery increased with making two split applications when compared to all n being applied prior to sowing although n recovery decreased when comparing four split applications when compared to a single pre sowing n application these results demonstrate that making up to two split n applications can result in a greater amount of lint produced per kilogram of n applied translating into a greater economic return and nutrient use efficiency soil properties have also been demonstrated to influence both the total in season n rates and the timing of application the concept of economically optimal nitrogen rate eonr has been found to be useful for evaluating yield responses to n applied across different soil textures which have varying levels of productivity scharf et al 2012 reported a lower eonr for silt and sandy loams when compared to a clay soil this study also found no yield differences when n was evenly split 56 kg n ha 1 between pre plant early square or pre plant early flower in sand and silty loams however optimal n split for a clay soil was 1 3 pre plant 1 3 early square and 1 3 early flower scharf et al 2012 soil texture is likely a major cause of the variability in the effectiveness of n management consisting of different total amounts or split applications additionally roberts et al 2015 compared n mineralization and immobilization among a sandy loam and clay loam finding that the sandy loam had greater n mineralization rates the clay loam soil texture also had greater immobilization rates when the amount of cotton residue was increased these results demonstrate that the combination of climatic conditions and soil properties influence soil n availability over the growing season irrigation water can also be a costly management input in the approximately 40 of u s cotton production systems which receive irrigation across the southeast and southwest regions vellidis et al 2016 total water application for producing maximum lint yields in the southwest regions of the u s have been reported to be 74 cm however the relationship between lint yield and total water applied predicted lint yield reductions when total water applied was greater than 80 cm wanjura et al 2002 as with n application soil texture undoubtedly influences the lint yield responses to varying irrigation regimes tolk and howell 2010 zhou et al 2016 additionally there has been research demonstrating the sensitivity of cotton lint production to timing of water stress to specific phenological stages hake and grimes 2010 overall these results suggest that the effectiveness of irrigation application rates on cotton growth and yield are heavily influenced by soil type regional and local climate conditions and phenological development demonstrating the need to develop irrigation scheduling solutions which encompass these variables some current irrigation decision tools have begun to account for these variables and are being made readily available to growers through digital irrigation scheduling tools migliaccio et al 2016 todorovic et al 2016 many of these digital irrigation scheduling tools utilize soil water balance models with methods outlined in the fao 56 irrigation and drainage paper allen et al 1998 an irrigation scheduling tool developed specifically for cotton is the cotton smartirrigation smartphone application http smartirrigationapps org cotton app the model running this smart phone application is an et based soil water balance model that estimates root zone soil water deficits using weather data soil parameters crop coefficients kc over plant development and irrigation applications vellidis et al 2016 the model was calibrated over multiple years and field locations by calibrating fao 56 kc values for cotton so that 50 root zone soil water depletion corresponded to approximately 40 50 kpa vellidis et al 2016 cotton yields were similar or greater when managing irrigation using this phone application when compared to other scheduling methods vellidis et al 2016 these results indicate that this model is effective at irrigation scheduling however more research is needed to determine if irrigation amounts can be optimized using the plant available water depletion estimates individually both n and irrigation management have been examined extensively in cotton however less research has examined these critical inputs simultaneously as would be the realistic management challenge in many cotton production systems in the small body of literature available there is no clear indication that n and irrigation always interact for example pettigrew and zeng 2014 reported no additional gain in lint yield from furrow irrigation when n was not applied although lint yield increases with irrigation were obtained at n rates of 56 and 112 kg n ha 1 singh et al 2010 reported interactive effects of irrigation and in season n management where seed cotton yield increased linearly with total n rate applications up to 200 kg n ha 1 with drip irrigation applied at 0 8 1 0 etc this study also reported that cotton plants treated with 0 5 0 6 etc achieved maximal lint yields under 160 kg n ha 1 with slight yield declines at 200 kg n ha 1 in contrast bronson et al 2006 in a study conducted in west texas found no irrigation by n interaction when irrigation was applied using a center pivot at et replacement rates of 63 93 and n treatments including pre plant and split rates other research evaluating both n and irrigation management simultaneously has reported that lint yield was mostly determined by n when crop amount was less than 130 kg n ha 1 whereas lint yields were mostly determined by plant available water when crop n was greater than this critical amount ockerby et al 1993 given these somewhat contrasting results it is clear that cotton lint yield responses may be dependent on whether water or n availability is more limiting to lint yield in an effort to characterize the interaction between n and irrigation management with a focus on whole plant responses this study chose to assess two sites characterized by sandy sandy loam soils research into these interactions is particularly important for systems with this soil texture in a humid climate because the risk for drought and n leaching losses are high thus making management decisions regarding n and irrigation particularly impactful to economic returns and environmental quality however there can be a range of sandy soil textures within the southeastern u s so two locations were targeted for evaluation of n and irrigation management the jay location having a sandy loam soil texture and the citra location consisting of a deep sand soil texture at both sites the overall objectives of this research were to i evaluate varying levels of plant available water replacement pawr estimated by the et based soil water balance model cotton smartirrigation smartphone application vellidis et al 2016 which gives site specific recommendation for irrigation scheduling ii determine optimal in season n rates when equal split applications were made at first square and bloom and iii assess the possible interactive effects of various plant available water replenish pawr and in season n rates which may influence water and n management decisions the effectiveness of these n and irrigation treatments were evaluated by quantifying whole plant measurements of spad chlorophyll content leaf area index lai n uptake harvest index and lint yield responses at the citra location 2 materials and methods 2 1 site

plots at both sites consisted of four in season n treatments surface broadcast applied as nh4no3 at first square and flower at 0 n0 22 n22 34 n34 and 45 kg n ha 1 n45 per application all plots received an initial n application broadcast applied as nh4no3 at 22 kg n ha 1 immediately after sowing 2 3 physiological measurements citra physiological mechanisms associated with responses to n and irrigation management were assessed at citra through a series of whole plant and leaf level measurements taken throughout the season leaf area index lai was measured using an lai 2200 li cor lincoln nebraska and was initiated at the first square phenological development stage 2015 40 days after sowing das 2016 37 das with subsequent measurements occurring bi weekly until 50 of plants had a first fully developed boll 2015 77 das 2016 75 das a single measurement of lai for a plot was conducted by taking one above and four equidistant readings below the canopy as a perpendicular transect between the rows with the sensor view parallel to the row and repeating this sequence with the sensor view perpendicular to the row to gain greater spatial averaging a lens cap cover with a 45 angle was used on all measurement dates measurements were taken in early morning with a cast shadow over the plot area to prevent diurnal bias and underestimation of lai values leaf level measurements of spad chlorophyll content konica minolta tokyo japan were initiated at the first square phenological development stage with subsequent measurements occurring bi weekly until approximately 50 of plants had a first fully developed boll these measurements occurred on the first fully mature leaf on the main stem ten plants were randomly selected per plot and the measurements were averaged when all plots had approximately 30 of their bolls open by visual assessment 0 75 m of row in each plot was harvested for determining n uptake stems were cut at the soil surface and fresh above ground biomass per unit area was determined whole plants were ground using a wood chipper and approximately 500 g of fresh weight was collected as a sub sample this sub sample was dried at 70 c for seven days and weighed for determining tissue water content which was used to calculate the dry above ground biomass per unit area the dry sub sample was further ground through a wiley mill and plant material that passed through a 1 mm sieve was collected this plant tissue was analyzed for total n waters agricultural laboratories inc camilla ga using the combustion method total percent n content was multiplied by the dry above ground biomass per area to determine total n uptake per area 2 4 harvest citra and jay termination of the cotton crop cycle was carried out when there were four nodes above the last boll that had at least partially opened at that time a harvest aid consisting of 0 56 kg a i ha 1 paraquat dichloride was sprayed for defoliation the two center rows of each plot were machine harvested using a spindle cotton picker john deere moline il and lint yield determined in 2015 at 139 and 149 das at citra and jay respectively and in 2016 at 162 and 159 das at citra and jay respectively spindle pickers were modified so cotton lint for each plot could be collected in mesh bags cotton lint collected was hand weighed for each plot and a 250 g sub sample was collected and the seed removed from the lint using a table top cotton gin to determine lint yield alone gin turnout harvest index was calculated as the ratio of lint weight per unit area and above ground biomass per unit area harvested at 30 open bolls 2 5 statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed using sas v 9 4 statistical software sas institute 2013 proc glimmix was used to compute analysis of variance anova random effects of rep nested within year and rep crossed with irrigation nested within year were included in the model all other factors were treated as fixed repeated measures anova was performed on measurements that were repeated over the growing season spad and lai autoregressive covariance matrix structure was specified for repeated measure anova normality and homogeneity were visually assessed by graphing the residual distribution scatter plot of residuals and q q plot of residuals no data was pooled over the two site years due to the strong main and interactive effect of year data was pooled over factors of irrigation nitrogen or sampling time within a season repeated measure when appropriate as indicated by a non significant f test results multiple comparisons significance was determined using fisher s protected least significant difference lsd at a 0 05 probability level 3 results 3 1 yearly precipitation and irrigation different amounts of precipitation were received during the two growing seasons of 2015 and 2016 at citra cumulative rainfall during 2015 and 2016 was 837 and 647 mm respectively fig 1 the varying amounts and distribution of precipitation over the growing season impacted the total number of irrigation events scheduled within the two growing seasons during 2015 three irrigation applications were applied within the period of 41 63 das table1 for a total of 59 mm two of these irrigation applications occurred prior to first bloom with the third and final application at seven days after first bloom following the final irrigation application the precipitation received far exceeded the reference evapotranspiration eto for 2016 there were nine irrigation applications during the period of 31 84 das for a total of 205 mm three of these applications occurred prior to first bloom four in between first bloom and developed boll and two in early boll development following the third irrigation application the cumulative eto exceeded the cumulative precipitation for the majority of the rest of the growing season contrary to the conditions at citra precipitation at jay during 2015 and 2016 were similar cumulative precipitation for 2015 and 2016 were 628 and 666 mm respectively fig 1 with these levels of precipitation and the greater soil water holding capacity utilized by the soil water balance model little irrigation was required resulting in only one irrigation treatment applied at 78 and 64 das during 2015 and 2016 respectively these irrigation timings corresponded to times in phenological development when the kc value utilized by the soil water balance was at its maximum and when the cumulative eto was approximately equal to the cumulative precipitation in both years at jay the cumulative eto did exceed cumulative precipitation early in the growing season however the soil water balance model did not call for irrigation this is likely due to the combination of the greater soil water holding capacity value specified in the model and the low kc value utilized by the model early in the phenological development 3 2 leaf area index and spad chlorophyll content differences in total water received during each year at citra likely led to the differences in lai between years table 2 what was similar between years was an observed trend where lai continued to increase up to six weeks after first square 82 and 79 das in 2015 and 2016 respectively to values of 4 7 and 2 9 averaged across treatments in 2015 and 2016 respectively figs 2 and 3 following six weeks after first square a decrease in lai occurred in both years likely due to leaf senescence to reductions of 32 and 19 in 2015 and 2016 respectively year also interacted with the irrigation and n treatments in 2015 the 100 irrigation treatment had a greater lai than all other irrigation treatments at two weeks after first square 54 das fig 2 in 2016 the 50 pa treatment resulted in a greater lai at six and eight weeks after first square when compared to the other irrigation treatments fig 3 for n treatments in both years those that received in season n n22 n34 and n45 maintained a greater lai than the non treated control following first bloom further these in season n treatments maintained similar lai across the entire season in 2015 results were similar in 2016 except for increased lai in the n34 treatment in comparison to the n22 treatment at six weeks following first square 79 das differences in spad chlorophyll were not evident among water treatments in 2015 whereas in 2016 the rf and 50 irrigation treatments maintained greater spad chlorophyll content later in the growing season when compared to the 100 and 50 pa treatments fig 2 in season n rates did impact spad chlorophyll content in 2015 which resulted in the n22 treatment having lower chlorophyll content than the n45 at six and eight weeks after first square 82 and 96 dap the n45 treatment had similar spad chlorophyll content to the n34 treatment in 2016 the spad chlorophyll content was similar among the in season n treatments except for the last measurement date at 8 weeks after first square 93 das fig 3 overall when averaged across all treatments there was a lower spad chlorophyll content during the 2015 growing season with a marked decline after first square 40 das in this year whereas spad chlorophyll content was relatively stable over the measurement period in 2016 3 3 nitrogen uptake there was a direct effect of n application rate on plant total n uptake in both years with no interaction between n and irrigation fig 4 a reduced amount of n uptake was observed in the treatment that only received the base application at sowing n22 compared to all the other treatments in both years when comparing treatments that had received in season n the patterns were different among years for 2015 no differences in n uptake existed while in 2016 the two mid level treatments n22 and n34 differed when averaged across all treatments there was an increase in n uptake of 56 kg n ha 1 when comparing 2016 to 2015 fig 4 3 4 lint characteristics and harvest index research location had a strong impact on lint yield in both years in 2015 greater lint yields of 1042 kg ha 1 were observed when comparing jay to citra when averaged across all treatments greater lint yield of 393 kg ha 1 were also observed at the jay location in 2016 when averaged across all treatments both n and irrigation had an interactive effect with year on lint yield at the citra location fig 5 while no main or interactive effect of irrigation with n occurred for lint yields at the jay location fig 6 the variable effects of irrigation on yield noted between the sites was likely due to the fact that water was never limited at the jay location while water was limiting in citra in 2016 for example in the relatively wet year of 2015 at citra no lint yield differences were observed among irrigation treatments fig 5 while for the relatively dry year of 2016 at this site the 100 and 50 pa irrigation treatments had the greatest yields impacts of the n treatments on lint yield were variable between the two growing season and locations in 2015 at citra differences in lint yield only occurred between the n0 and n45 treatments with the highest yield measured in the latter treatment similarly at jay a main effect of in season n application rates was consistent among the two years with the n34 and n45 treatments having similar lint yields of 1457 and 1398 kg ha 1 respectively and the n45 treatment having greater lint yield compared to the n22 treatment contrary to these results was the yield at citra in 2016 with the n45 treatment having lower yield than the other three application rates influences of these yield patterns were evident in the hi measured at citra the hi of n0 was greater than all treatments that received in season n n22 n34 and n45 during both growing seasons treatments receiving in season n had similar hi in 2015 in 2016 the n45 treatment had a lower hi than n22 the impacts of irrigation were only evident in 2016 at this site with a lower hi for the rf treatment when compared to 100 and 50 pa fig 5 in 2015 lint yields increased with increasing n applied despite no hi differences among the n22 n34 and n 45 this indicates that the increased lint yields from additional n application was not proportional to the increases in vegetative biomass accumulation for 2016 at citra the yield and hi patterns were similar with the highest and lowest hi values recorded for the n22 and n45 treatments respectively fig 5 4 discussion one critical challenge for cotton producers that have farms with deep sandy soils is that these soils are characterized as having low water holding capacity with rapid drainage permeability these soil properties can result in the development of water deficit stress from rapid soil drying during dry periods and high amounts of nitrate leaching following intense precipitation events these disparate events often occur in the same growing season making irrigation and n management complex therefore the use of decision support tools such as the smartirrigation app tested in this study is critically important for the efficient use of these resources in stochastic humid environment cotton production systems with high sand content soils the research locations and years during this research had both extremes of dry and wet conditions allowing for a broad assessment of the irrigation and n responses that are inclusive of the typical range of conditions experienced by southeastern cotton producers the two locations of this study varied in soil texture likely contributing to differences in soil water availability among the two locations the differences in possible soil water availability of the two soil textures is represented in the et based soil water balance model by having different water holding capacities this parameter setting in combination with variability in precipitation patterns resulted in different lint yield responses to irrigation indicating that water limitations to yield were not equal between the two locations at jay with soils having possibly greater soil water availability than citra water was clearly not limiting since in both years the rf treatment had similar lint yields when compared to the irrigated treatments this is likely because the smartirrigation app scheduled only one irrigation application in both years in this sandy loam soil type irrigation treatments may often be more of a safeguard during years when precipitation totals are below average but not necessarily a yearly requirement at the citra location where the water holding capacity parameter utilized by the model was set at a lower value the smartirrigation app scheduled a greater number of water applications in both years when compared to the jay location in 2016 even though similar amounts of total precipitation were received among the two locations the irrigation scheduling tool utilized adjustments to the soil water balance model based on soil texture and precipitation timing thus leading to a greater number of recommended irrigation events at citra this shows the improvement of model performance that soil texture and precipitation pattern information provides leading to improved site specific irrigation recommendations even though the soils at citra are particularly vulnerable to water deficits the results of the current study show that a 50 reduction in pawr can occur up until first bloom without any detriment to yield however when a 50 reduction in irrigation was extended past first bloom lint yield reductions did occur when compared to 100 peak flower has been documented to be a sensitive time for water deficit stress due to the greatest number of young bolls being present on the plant which are most sensitive to water deficit induced abscission grimes et al 1970 hake and grimes 2010 differences in soil texture and precipitation patterns between citra and jay that led to differences in the water limitations to cotton production also led to differences in the strength of n limitations at each site this was illustrated by the differences in optimal n application rates the optimal uniform n split application at the jay location was n34 while the optimal rate was n22 at the citra location these results are contrary to the general consensus that soils with greater sand content prone to greater amounts of no3 leaching require n inputs of greater quantity per application this may be due to significant amounts of soil no3 pulsing occurring during several large precipitation events early in the growing season at the citra location in 2015 resulting in uniformly low soil n across the range of n treatments utilized in this study this is evident in the little to no differences in spad lai and n uptake in the wet year of 2015 at the citra location furthermore the average lint yields at jay were substantially greater than citra which could possibly be due to the soil texture having greater water holding capacity and nutrient fertility but also due to less intense precipitation events resulting in large pulses of no3 leaching the overall greater lint yields at jay also likely contributed to the lint yield responses to applying additional nitrogen with the n34 treatment whereas the most optimal n treatment at citra was the lower n treatment of n22 overall the results in this study suggest that yearly weather conditions determined whether n or water was more limiting to growth yield further support for this conclusion is seen by the lack of an interaction between irrigation and n management on crop development and production this result occurred despite having significant main effects of both n and irrigation during both the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons the lack of an interaction between n and irrigation was clearly evident during the 2015 growing season when a continual decrease in spad chlorophyll content in all n treatments following the last n application at first bloom 54 das occurred this indicates that all treatments receiving in season n may have had some level of n deficiency which is also supported by the low amounts of n uptake during the 2015 season when compared to 2016 however treatments which received n still had greater spad chlorophyll content and lai than the non treated control nonetheless differences did not occur among the treatments which received in season n for spad chlorophyll content lai n uptake and lint yield these results support that in years with high precipitation and high soil no3 pulsing greater n application frequency is likely more effective than increasing the quantity of n applied in a single application the dry year of 2016 at citra further underscores the point that liebig s law of minimum stating that the most limiting factor in a production system will limit yield by the absence of any interaction between the n and irrigation treatments however in this year water was more limiting than n resulting in a strong irrigation effect evidence for this claim is supported by the overall reduction in lai across all treatments when compared to the 2015 season and larger differences in spad chlorophyll content lai and lint yield among the irrigation treatments in 2016 absolute values of spad chlorophyll content and n uptake where greater in 2016 when compared to 2015 further demonstrating that n limitation was never an issue in 2016 other studies have documented little lint yield benefit of increasing irrigation or n when one of the other resources is limiting bronson et al 2006 pettigrew and zeng 2014 the overall implications of the lack of interactive effects among irrigation and n in this study demonstrates that management of these two resources is not necessarily dependent on each other but rather avoiding deficiency to create a synergistic effect is most critical to improving yield potentials as demonstrated in this research this is often a challenging task for crop producers in humid production environments with sandy soils therefore technologies tools which have early detection of water stress or n deficiency for mitigating associated yield losses is essential the results of this research demonstrated that soil water balance irrigation scheduling tools can be beneficial in providing site specific irrigation recommendations however simply basing in season n applications on plant requirements and phenological development may not be effective strategies in environments with stochastic weather site specific decision support tools for n requirements are needed for optimizing n management in stochastic agricultural production environments 5 conclusion the contrasting weather conditions and soil types between the locations and years of this study allowed for a strong assessment of both n and irrigation management using smartphone irrigation support tool in both years lint yield maintenance or gains occurred with making two split n applications at first square and bloom of n22 at the citra location a 45 kg n ha 1 reduction in comparison to the traditional total n recommendation of 112 kg n ha 1 yield maintenance also occurred when reducing the pawr by 50 up until first bloom no lint yield responses to irrigation were observed in either year at the jay location with a sandy loam soil while the optimal uniform n split application was n34 these management strategies offer ways to cut input cost which are of economic importance when growing cotton in humid production environments with sandy or sandy loam soil types future research is needed that can develop tools which can give both site specific in season recommendation for both irrigation and n acknowledgement we would like to thank cotton incorporated for supporting this research 
11122,nitrogen n and irrigation can be two of the costliest management inputs in united states u s cotton gossypium hirsutum l production systems furthermore input amounts are often dependent on yearly environmental conditions making it challenging to optimize n and irrigation management the objectives of this research were to determine optimal n and irrigation management by i evaluating equally split in season n rates applied at first square and bloom in combination with varying levels of plant available water replacement pawr estimated by an et based soil water balance model for

crop measurements consisting of spad chlorophyll content leaf area index lai n uptake and harvest index hi were conducted at the citra site contrasting soil textures and weather conditions between research locations and years allowed for a comprehensive assessment of both n and irrigation management across varying environmental conditions lint yield was either increased or at least maintained during the two years of this research at the citra location by making two split n applications at first square and bloom of n22 while the optimal n treatment at the jay location was n34 at first square and bloom in both years of this research additionally a yield reduction occurred in the dry year of 2016 at the citra location when n45 was applied at first square and bloom the most efficient irrigation strategy at the citra location was the primed acclimation treatment at the jay location the rf control had similar lint yields as the irrigated treatments in both years indicating that

area index pa primed acclimation pawr plant available water replenishment keywords cotton management irrigation support tools plant available water replenishment split nitrogen applications 1 introduction nitrogen is the most important applied nutrient in cotton production systems due to the potential of increasing lint yields with increasing n rates muharam et al 2014 the possible economic gain by increasing n applications has led to many studies aimed at quantifying the n requirement per unit of lint produced resulting in estimates ranging from 10 to 29 kg n 100 kg 1 lint across global cotton production regions miley and oosterhuis 1989 gerik et al 1998 typical n application rates in the cotton production regions of the united states u s differ widely with reported ranges from 71 to 220 kg n ha 1 taylor 1995 a major factor adding to the complexity of determining optimal n application strategies is n loss through no3 leaching and denitrification both of which are heavily influenced by unpredictable seasonal environmental conditions and soil texture using in season n applications that split the total n applied into percentages applied at varying developmental stages is a management strategy that attempts to increase n efficiency by synchronizing soil n concentrations to plant n demand cotton n accumulation is non linear with an exponential increase reported to begin at first square reaching peak accumulation rates at approximately early to mid bloom the developmental stage that accounts for up to 23 45 of the total n accumulation armstrong and albert 1931 olson and bledsoe 1942 bassett et al 1970 halevy 1976 oosterhuis et al 1983 halevy et al 1987 mullins and burmester 1991 furthermore n accumulation in the seeds and lint account for up to 43 60 of the total plant n resulting in a significant amount of n accumulated in vegetative biomass during peak accumulation being remobilized relatively late in the growing season mullins and burmester 2010 due to this late season n demand several studies have reported lint yield increases by utilizing in season n applications until the phenological stage characterized by peak bloom geng et al 2015 yang et al 2011 these positive yield results may be a result of maintaining a sufficient level of n in plant vegetative biomass to serve as an n source to reproductive structures however the benefits of split n application are not always consistent some reports have observed declines in maximal obtainable lint yields when comparing split n applications of 50 at pre plant and first square to yields obtained by applying 100 pre plant n when utilizing n rates up to 180 kg n ha 1 reiter et al 2008 research conducted by constable and rochester 1988 showed that n recovery increased with making two split applications when compared to all n being applied prior to sowing although n recovery decreased when comparing four split applications when compared to a single pre sowing n application these results demonstrate that making up to two split n applications can result in a greater amount of lint produced per kilogram of n applied translating into a greater economic return and nutrient use efficiency soil properties have also been demonstrated to influence both the total in season n rates and the timing of application the concept of economically optimal nitrogen rate eonr has been found to be useful for evaluating yield responses to n applied across different soil textures which have varying levels of productivity scharf et al 2012 reported a lower eonr for silt and sandy loams when compared to a clay soil this study also found no yield differences when n was evenly split 56 kg n ha 1 between pre plant early square or pre plant early flower in sand and silty loams however optimal n split for a clay soil was 1 3 pre plant 1 3 early square and 1 3 early flower scharf et al 2012 soil texture is likely a major cause of the variability in the effectiveness of n management consisting of different total amounts or split applications additionally roberts et al 2015 compared n mineralization and immobilization among a sandy loam and clay loam finding that the sandy loam had greater n mineralization rates the clay loam soil texture also had greater immobilization rates when the amount of cotton residue was increased these results demonstrate that the combination of climatic conditions and soil properties influence soil n availability over the growing season irrigation water can also be a costly management input in the approximately 40 of u s cotton production systems which receive irrigation across the southeast and southwest regions vellidis et al 2016 total water application for producing maximum lint yields in the southwest regions of the u s have been reported to be 74 cm however the relationship between lint yield and total water applied predicted lint yield reductions when total water applied was greater than 80 cm wanjura et al 2002 as with n application soil texture undoubtedly influences the lint yield responses to varying irrigation regimes tolk and howell 2010 zhou et al 2016 additionally there has been research demonstrating the sensitivity of cotton lint production to timing of water stress to specific phenological stages hake and grimes 2010 overall these results suggest that the effectiveness of irrigation application rates on cotton growth and yield are heavily influenced by soil type regional and local climate conditions and phenological development demonstrating the need to develop irrigation scheduling solutions which encompass these variables some current irrigation decision tools have begun to account for these variables and are being made readily available to growers through digital irrigation scheduling tools migliaccio et al 2016 todorovic et al 2016 many of these digital irrigation scheduling tools utilize soil water balance models with methods outlined in the fao 56 irrigation and drainage paper allen et al 1998 an irrigation scheduling tool developed specifically for cotton is the cotton smartirrigation smartphone application http smartirrigationapps org cotton

water depletion corresponded to approximately 40 50 kpa vellidis et al 2016 cotton yields were similar or greater when managing irrigation using this phone application when compared to other scheduling methods vellidis et al 2016 these results indicate that this model is effective at irrigation scheduling however more research is needed to determine if irrigation amounts can be optimized using the plant available water depletion estimates individually both n and irrigation management have been examined extensively in cotton however less research has examined these critical inputs simultaneously as would be the realistic management challenge in many cotton production systems in the small body of literature available there is no clear indication that n and irrigation always interact for example pettigrew and zeng 2014 reported no additional gain in lint yield from furrow irrigation when n was not applied although lint yield increases with irrigation were obtained at n rates of 56 and 112 kg n ha 1 singh et al 2010 reported interactive effects of irrigation and in season n management where seed cotton yield increased linearly with total n rate applications up to 200 kg n ha 1 with drip irrigation applied at 0 8 1 0 etc this study also reported that cotton plants treated with 0 5 0 6 etc achieved maximal lint yields under 160 kg n ha 1 with slight yield declines at 200 kg n ha 1 in contrast bronson et al 2006 in a study conducted in west texas found no irrigation by n interaction when irrigation was applied using a center pivot at et replacement rates of 63 93 and n treatments including pre plant and split rates other research evaluating both n and irrigation management simultaneously has reported that lint yield was mostly determined by n when crop amount was less than 130 kg n ha 1 whereas lint yields were mostly determined by plant available water when crop n was greater than this critical amount ockerby et al 1993 given these somewhat contrasting results it is clear that cotton lint yield responses may be dependent on whether water or n availability is more limiting to lint yield in an effort to characterize the interaction between n and irrigation management with a focus on whole plant responses this study chose to assess two sites characterized by sandy sandy loam soils research into these interactions is particularly important for systems with this soil texture in a humid climate because the risk for drought and n leaching losses are high thus making management decisions regarding n and irrigation particularly impactful to economic returns and environmental quality however there can be a range of sandy soil textures within the southeastern u s so two locations were targeted for evaluation of n and irrigation management the jay location having a sandy loam soil texture and the citra location consisting of a deep sand soil texture at both sites the overall objectives of this research were to i evaluate varying levels of plant available water replacement pawr estimated by the et based soil water balance model cotton smartirrigation smartphone application vellidis et al 2016 which gives site specific recommendation for irrigation scheduling ii determine optimal in season n rates when equal split applications were made at first square and bloom and iii assess the possible interactive effects of various plant available water replenish pawr and in season n rates which may influence water and n management decisions the effectiveness of these n and irrigation treatments were evaluated by quantifying whole plant measurements of spad chlorophyll content leaf area index lai n uptake harvest index and lint yield responses at the citra location 2 materials and methods 2 1 site

plots at both sites consisted of four in season n treatments surface broadcast applied as nh4no3 at first square and flower at 0 n0 22 n22 34 n34 and 45 kg n ha 1 n45 per application all plots received an initial n application broadcast applied as nh4no3 at 22 kg n ha 1 immediately after sowing 2 3 physiological measurements citra physiological mechanisms associated with responses to n and irrigation management were assessed at citra through a series of whole plant and leaf level measurements taken throughout the season leaf area index lai was measured using an lai 2200 li cor lincoln nebraska and was initiated at the first square phenological development stage 2015 40 days after sowing das 2016 37 das with subsequent measurements occurring bi weekly until 50 of plants had a first fully developed boll 2015 77 das 2016 75 das a single measurement of lai for a plot was conducted by taking one above and four equidistant readings below the canopy as a perpendicular transect between the rows with the sensor view parallel to the row and repeating this sequence with the sensor view perpendicular to the row to gain greater spatial averaging a lens cap cover with a 45 angle was used on all measurement dates measurements were taken in early morning with a cast shadow over the plot area to prevent diurnal bias and underestimation of lai values leaf level measurements of spad chlorophyll content konica minolta tokyo japan were initiated at the first square phenological development stage with subsequent measurements occurring bi weekly until approximately 50 of plants had a first fully developed boll these measurements occurred on the first fully mature leaf on the main stem ten plants were randomly selected per plot and the measurements were averaged when all plots had approximately 30 of their bolls open by visual assessment 0 75 m of row in each plot was harvested for determining n uptake stems were cut at the soil surface and fresh above ground biomass per unit area was determined whole plants were ground using a wood chipper and approximately 500 g of fresh weight was collected as a sub sample this sub sample was dried at 70 c for seven days and weighed for determining tissue water content which was used to calculate the dry above ground biomass per unit area the dry sub sample was further ground through a wiley mill and plant material that passed through a 1 mm sieve was collected this plant tissue was analyzed for total n waters agricultural laboratories inc camilla ga using the combustion method total percent n content was multiplied by the dry above ground biomass per area to determine total n uptake per area 2 4 harvest citra and jay termination of the cotton crop cycle was carried out when there were four nodes above the last boll that had at least partially opened at that time a harvest aid consisting of 0 56 kg a i ha 1 paraquat dichloride was sprayed for defoliation the two center rows of each plot were machine harvested using a spindle cotton picker john deere moline il and lint yield determined in 2015 at 139 and 149 das at citra and jay respectively and in 2016 at 162 and 159 das at citra and jay respectively spindle pickers were modified so cotton lint for each plot could be collected in mesh bags cotton lint collected was hand weighed for each plot and a 250 g sub sample was collected and the seed removed from the lint using a table top cotton gin to determine lint yield alone gin turnout harvest index was calculated as the ratio of lint weight per unit area and above ground biomass per unit area harvested at 30 open bolls 2 5 statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed using sas v 9 4 statistical software sas institute 2013 proc glimmix was used to compute analysis of variance anova random effects of rep nested within year and rep crossed with irrigation nested within year were included in the model all other factors were treated as fixed repeated measures anova was performed on measurements that were repeated over the growing season spad and lai autoregressive covariance matrix structure was specified for repeated measure anova normality and homogeneity were visually assessed by graphing the residual distribution scatter plot of residuals and q q plot of residuals no data was pooled over the two site years due to the strong main and interactive effect of year data was pooled over factors of irrigation nitrogen or sampling time within a season repeated measure when appropriate as indicated by a non significant f test results multiple comparisons significance was determined using fisher s protected least significant difference lsd at a 0 05 probability level 3 results 3 1 yearly precipitation and irrigation different amounts of precipitation were received during the two growing seasons of 2015 and 2016 at citra cumulative rainfall during 2015 and 2016 was 837 and 647 mm respectively fig 1 the varying amounts and distribution of precipitation over the growing season impacted the total number of irrigation events scheduled within the two growing seasons during 2015 three irrigation applications were applied within the period of 41 63 das table1 for a total of 59 mm two of these irrigation applications occurred prior to first bloom with the third and final application at seven days after first bloom following the final irrigation application the precipitation received far exceeded the reference evapotranspiration eto for 2016 there were nine irrigation applications during the period of 31 84 das for a total of 205 mm three of these applications occurred prior to first bloom four in between first bloom and developed boll and two in early boll development following the third irrigation application the cumulative eto exceeded the cumulative precipitation for the majority of the rest of the growing season contrary to the conditions at citra precipitation at jay during 2015 and 2016 were similar cumulative precipitation for 2015 and 2016 were 628 and 666 mm respectively fig 1 with these levels of precipitation and the greater soil water holding capacity utilized by the soil water balance model little irrigation was required resulting in only one irrigation treatment applied at 78 and 64 das during 2015 and 2016 respectively these irrigation timings corresponded to times in phenological development when the kc value utilized by the soil water balance was at its maximum and when the cumulative eto was approximately equal to the cumulative precipitation in both years at jay the cumulative eto did exceed cumulative precipitation early in the growing season however the soil water balance model did not call for irrigation this is likely due to the combination of the greater soil water holding capacity value specified in the model and the low kc value utilized by the model early in the phenological development 3 2 leaf area index and spad chlorophyll content differences in total water received during each year at citra likely led to the differences in lai between years table 2 what was similar between years was an observed trend where lai continued to increase up to six weeks after first square 82 and 79 das in 2015 and 2016 respectively to values of 4 7 and 2 9 averaged across treatments in 2015 and 2016 respectively figs 2 and 3 following six weeks after first square a decrease in lai occurred in both years likely due to leaf senescence to reductions of 32 and 19 in 2015 and 2016 respectively year also interacted with the irrigation and n treatments in 2015 the 100 irrigation treatment had a greater lai than all other irrigation treatments at two weeks after first square 54 das fig 2 in 2016 the 50 pa treatment resulted in a greater lai at six and eight weeks after first square when compared to the other irrigation treatments fig 3 for n treatments in both years those that received in season n n22 n34 and n45 maintained a greater lai than the non treated control following first bloom further these in season n treatments maintained similar lai across the entire season in 2015 results were similar in 2016 except for increased lai in the n34 treatment in comparison to the n22 treatment at six weeks following first square 79 das differences in spad chlorophyll were not evident among water treatments in 2015 whereas in 2016 the rf and 50 irrigation treatments maintained greater spad chlorophyll content later in the growing season when compared to the 100 and 50 pa treatments fig 2 in season n rates did impact spad chlorophyll content in 2015 which resulted in the n22 treatment having lower chlorophyll content than the n45 at six and eight weeks after first square 82 and 96 dap the n45 treatment had similar spad chlorophyll content to the n34 treatment in 2016 the spad chlorophyll content was similar among the in season n treatments except for the last measurement date at 8 weeks after first square 93 das fig 3 overall when averaged across all treatments there was a lower spad chlorophyll content during the 2015 growing season with a marked decline after first square 40 das in this year whereas spad chlorophyll content was relatively stable over the measurement period in 2016 3 3 nitrogen uptake there was a direct effect of n application rate on plant total n uptake in both years with no interaction between n and irrigation fig 4 a reduced amount of n uptake was observed in the treatment that only received the base application at sowing n22 compared to all the other treatments in both years when comparing treatments that had received in season n the patterns were different among years for 2015 no differences in n uptake existed while in 2016 the two mid level treatments n22 and n34 differed when averaged across all treatments there was an increase in n uptake of 56 kg n ha 1 when comparing 2016 to 2015 fig 4 3 4 lint characteristics and harvest index research location had a strong impact on lint yield in both years in 2015 greater lint yields of 1042 kg ha 1 were observed when comparing jay to citra when averaged across all treatments greater lint yield of 393 kg ha 1 were also observed at the jay location in 2016 when averaged across all treatments both n and irrigation had an interactive effect with year on lint yield at the citra location fig 5 while no main or interactive effect of irrigation with n occurred for lint yields at the jay location fig 6 the variable effects of irrigation on yield noted between the sites was likely due to the fact that water was never limited at the jay location while water was limiting in citra in 2016 for example in the relatively wet year of 2015 at citra no lint yield differences were observed among irrigation treatments fig 5 while for the relatively dry year of 2016 at this site the 100 and 50 pa irrigation treatments had the greatest yields impacts of the n treatments on lint yield were variable between the two growing season and locations in 2015 at citra differences in lint yield only occurred between the n0 and n45 treatments with the highest yield measured in the latter treatment similarly at jay a main effect of in season n application rates was consistent among the two years with the n34 and n45 treatments having similar lint yields of 1457 and 1398 kg ha 1 respectively and the n45 treatment having greater lint yield compared to the n22 treatment contrary to these results was the yield at citra in 2016 with the n45 treatment having lower yield than the other three application rates influences of these yield patterns were evident in the hi measured at citra the hi of n0 was greater than all treatments that received in season n n22 n34 and n45 during both growing seasons treatments receiving in season n had similar hi in 2015 in 2016 the n45 treatment had a lower hi than n22 the impacts of irrigation were only evident in 2016 at this site with a lower hi for the rf treatment when compared to 100 and 50 pa fig 5 in 2015 lint yields increased with increasing n applied despite no hi differences among the n22 n34 and n 45 this indicates that the increased lint yields from additional n application was not proportional to the increases in vegetative biomass accumulation for 2016 at citra the yield and hi patterns were similar with the highest and lowest hi values recorded for the n22 and n45 treatments respectively fig 5 4 discussion one critical challenge for cotton producers that have farms with deep sandy soils is that these soils are characterized as having low water holding capacity with rapid drainage permeability these soil properties can result in the development of water deficit stress from rapid soil drying during dry periods and high amounts of nitrate leaching following intense precipitation events these disparate events often occur in the same growing season making irrigation and n management complex therefore the use of decision support tools such as the smartirrigation app tested in this study is critically important for the efficient use of these resources in stochastic humid environment cotton production systems with high sand content soils the research locations and years during this research had both extremes of dry and wet conditions allowing for a broad assessment of the irrigation and n responses that are inclusive of the typical range of conditions experienced by southeastern cotton producers the two locations of this study varied in soil texture likely contributing to differences in soil water availability among the two locations the differences in possible soil water availability of the two soil textures is represented in the et based soil water balance model by having different water holding capacities this parameter setting in combination with variability in precipitation patterns resulted in different lint yield responses to irrigation indicating that water limitations to yield were not equal between the two locations at jay with soils having possibly greater soil water availability than citra water was clearly not limiting since in both years the rf treatment had similar lint yields when compared to the irrigated treatments this is likely because the smartirrigation app scheduled only one irrigation application in both years in this sandy loam soil type irrigation treatments may often be more of a safeguard during years when precipitation totals are below average but not necessarily a yearly requirement at the citra location where the water holding capacity parameter utilized by the model was set at a lower value the smartirrigation app scheduled a greater number of water applications in both years when compared to the jay location in 2016 even though similar amounts of total precipitation were received among the two locations the irrigation scheduling tool utilized adjustments to the soil water balance model based on soil texture and precipitation timing thus leading to a greater number of recommended irrigation events at citra this shows the improvement of model performance that soil texture and precipitation pattern information provides leading to improved site specific irrigation recommendations even though the soils at citra are particularly vulnerable to water deficits the results of the current study show that a 50 reduction in pawr can occur up until first bloom without any detriment to yield however when a 50 reduction in irrigation was extended past first bloom lint yield reductions did occur when compared to 100 peak flower has been documented to be a sensitive time for water deficit stress due to the greatest number of young bolls being present on the plant which are most sensitive to water deficit induced abscission grimes et al 1970 hake and grimes 2010 differences in soil texture and precipitation patterns between citra and jay that led to differences in the water limitations to cotton production also led to differences in the strength of n limitations at each site this was illustrated by the differences in optimal n application rates the optimal uniform n split application at the jay location was n34 while the optimal rate was n22 at the citra location these results are contrary to the general consensus that soils with greater sand content prone to greater amounts of no3 leaching require n inputs of greater quantity per application this may be due to significant amounts of soil no3 pulsing occurring during several large precipitation events early in the growing season at the citra location in 2015 resulting in uniformly low soil n across the range of n treatments utilized in this study this is evident in the little to no differences in spad lai and n uptake in the wet year of 2015 at the citra location furthermore the average lint yields at jay were substantially greater than citra which could possibly be due to the soil texture having greater water holding capacity and nutrient fertility but also due to less intense precipitation events resulting in large pulses of no3 leaching the overall greater lint yields at jay also likely contributed to the lint yield responses to applying additional nitrogen with the n34 treatment whereas the most optimal n treatment at citra was the lower n treatment of n22 overall the results in this study suggest that yearly weather conditions determined whether n or water was more limiting to growth yield further support for this conclusion is seen by the lack of an interaction between irrigation and n management on crop development and production this result occurred despite having significant main effects of both n and irrigation during both the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons the lack of an interaction between n and irrigation was clearly evident during the 2015 growing season when a continual decrease in spad chlorophyll content in all n treatments following the last n application at first bloom 54 das occurred this indicates that all treatments receiving in season n may have had some level of n deficiency which is also supported by the low amounts of n uptake during the 2015 season when compared to 2016 however treatments which received n still had greater spad chlorophyll content and lai than the non treated control nonetheless differences did not occur among the treatments which received in season n for spad chlorophyll content lai n uptake and lint yield these results support that in years with high precipitation and high soil no3 pulsing greater n application frequency is likely more effective than increasing the quantity of n applied in a single application the dry year of 2016 at citra further underscores the point that liebig s law of minimum stating that the most limiting factor in a production system will limit yield by the absence of any interaction between the n and irrigation treatments however in this year water was more limiting than n resulting in a strong irrigation effect evidence for this claim is supported by the overall reduction in lai across all treatments when compared to the 2015 season and larger differences in spad chlorophyll content lai and lint yield among the irrigation treatments in 2016 absolute values of spad chlorophyll content and n uptake where greater in 2016 when compared to 2015 further demonstrating that n limitation was never an issue in 2016 other studies have documented little lint yield benefit of increasing irrigation or n when one of the other resources is limiting bronson et al 2006 pettigrew and zeng 2014 the overall implications of the lack of interactive effects among irrigation and n in this study demonstrates that management of these two resources is not necessarily dependent on each other but rather avoiding deficiency to create a synergistic effect is most critical to improving yield potentials as demonstrated in this research this is often a challenging task for crop producers in humid production environments with sandy soils therefore technologies tools which have early detection of water stress or n deficiency for mitigating associated yield losses is essential the results of this research demonstrated that soil water balance irrigation scheduling tools can be beneficial in providing site specific irrigation recommendations however simply basing in season n applications on plant requirements and phenological development may not be effective strategies in environments with stochastic weather site specific decision support tools for n requirements are needed for optimizing n management in stochastic agricultural production environments 5 conclusion the contrasting weather conditions and soil types between the locations and years of this study allowed for a strong assessment of both n and irrigation management using smartphone irrigation support tool in both years lint yield maintenance or gains occurred with making two split n applications at first square and bloom of n22 at the citra location a 45 kg n ha 1 reduction in comparison to the traditional total n recommendation of 112 kg n ha 1 yield maintenance also occurred when reducing the pawr by 50 up until first bloom no lint yield responses to irrigation were observed in either year at the jay location with a sandy loam soil while the optimal uniform n split application was n34 these management strategies offer ways to cut input cost which are of economic importance when growing cotton in humid production environments with sandy or sandy loam soil types future research is needed that can develop tools which can give both site specific in season recommendation for both irrigation and n acknowledgement we would like to thank cotton incorporated for supporting this research 
11123,plastic mulch can significantly improve soil water and temperature conditions in croplands altering ecohydrological processes in agroecosystems therefore analysis of maize water consumption in response to plastic mulch is of importance to agricultural water management a field experiment was conducted in non mulched ck and mulched pm maize fields of eastern loess plateau to monitor maize evapotranspiration at different scales portable photosynthesis system sap flow system and eddy covariance systems were utilized to measure transpiration rate at leaf scale sap flow at plant scale and evapotranspiration et at field scale respectively the results indicated pm provided a wetter condition 2 8 and 4 2 in soil water content for two growing seasons respectively for maize leading to

solar radiation rs vapor pressure deficit vpd wind speed u2 and its direction and rainfall were measured by a weather station rainroot scientific ltd beijing china nearby the experimental plots the measurement of climatic variables was performed 2 m above the ground the data was recorded at half hourly intervals in a data logger rr 1016 rainroot scientific ltd beijing china and daily values were calculated from half hourly values seven maize plants for each treatment were randomly selected to manually monitor green leaf area index glai and plant height at ten day intervals during maize growing season gali was calculated by the methods proposed by li et al 2008 total aboveground biomass was also measured from destructive maize samples at ten day intervals in seven sites total yields for each treatment were monitored when harvest and water use efficiency wue was calculated as the ratio of total yield over total et 2 3 2 leaf transpiration leaf transpiration rate tr at an interval of 2 h during 8 00 to 18 00 was measured by the portable gas exchange fluorescence system gfs 3000 heinz walz gmbh effeltrich germany the measurements were performed on july 23 july 31 and august 31 of 2016 2 3 3 soil evaporation micro lysimeters ml were applied to measure daily e the ml were installed in windy upstream direction of eddy covariance system in each plot each ml has a diameter of 30 cm and height of 11 cm reinstallation of the ml was performed at 3 day intervals or within one day if rainfall occurs the reinstallation was made with undisturbed soil samples to avoid influence of soil hydraulics and structure weighting of ml was performed at 18 00 every day using an electric balance with the precision of 0 1 g to calculate e for ck treatment 10 ml were randomly distributed in the plot and directly averaged data were used for the analysis as for pm 6 ml were distributed under plastic film and 6 were located between plastic film thus averaged data based on the weight of plastic film covered 80 and non covered 20 area 2 3 4 sap flow rate sap ﬂow rate of four maize plants for each treatment was continuously measured using flow32 1 k sap flow system dynamax houston tx usa during july to august of 2016 the heat conduction of energy in the soil has asymmetric influence on sap temperature which might affect the measurement to reduce such influence each gauge of sap flow system was installed at the second internode of the maize stem with leaf sheaths removed jiang et al 2014 to reduce stem transpiration plastic wrap was used before installation of gauge uninstallation of gauges and maintenance of sap flow system were performed about every two weeks and reinstallation of gauges was performed on other maize plants since constant heating plant by gauges can lead to dryness of plants jiang et al 2014 sap flow rate was measured every minute and half hourly average data were recorded in a data logger cr1000 campbell scientiﬁc logan ut usa only data

soil surface and a net radiometer cnr1 kipp zonen inc delftechpark netherlands installed at 3 5 m above ground respectively for ck treatment three hfp01 sensors were distributed randomly at three locations respectively and averaged data were used for analysis as for the pm treatment only about 80 of the land surface was covered by plastic film thus two sensors were distributed under plastic film and one sensor was distributed between plastic film averaged data according to the weight of the mulching area 80 and no mulching area 20 were used for the analysis volumetric soil water content for ck and pm was also measured by water content reflectometers cs616 campbell scientiﬁc inc logan ut usa installation of the cs616 sensors followed same procedure as the hfp01 sensors the height of infrared gas analyzer and supersonic anemometer was adjusted from time to time to keep a relative height of 0 5 m with maize canopy the monitoring plot had a wide fetch of 75 m in all directions which allowed us to neglect heat advection in the maize field to reduce the uncertainty of data caused by different instruments the sensors and analyzers of ec system were calibrated before the experiment of each year details about the calibration are referred to gong et al 2017a flux and soil water data were recorded at 30 min intervals in a data logger cr5000 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa for

aboveground biomass and yield with standard errors were subjected to analysis the statistical differences of crop yield and wue between the two treatments were tested with t test using sas v 8 0 software sas institute cary nc at 5 level 3 results and discussion 3 1 environmental condition and crop growth fig 1 presents the dynamics of meteorological variables at the experimental site during 2015 2016 both ta and rs showed typical seasonal variations they increased from january to july then decreased gradually with mean ta of 18 and 18 c mean rs of 217 and 213 w m 2 during two growing seasons respectively table 1 u2 increased from january to may then decreased until late august and increased again over a year with mean u2 of 1 64 and 1 29 m s 1 for the two growing seasons respectively rh fluctuated from january to april and increased until late august then gradually decreased with mean rh of 60 and 68 for two growing seasons respectively vpd showed increase decrease trend over a year with mean vpd of 0 86 and 0 65 kpa for two growing seasons respectively et0 showed similar trend to u2 as u2 is the dominant climatic factor of et0 in this area fan et al 2016 with mean daily et0 of 3 50 and 3 09 mm d 1 for two growing seasons respectively total rainfall during growing seasons was 337 4 and 400 5 mm which accounted for 84 and 80 of annual rainfall respectively seasonal variations of volumetric soil water content swc under ck and pm are illustrated in fig 2 in general swc for ck and pm shared almost similar trend but swc for pm was higher than that of ck seasonal mean swc for ck and pm was 21 6 and 24 4 in 2015 and 18 2 and 22 4 in 2016 our results indicated pm provided a wetter condition 2 8 and 4 2 for two growing seasons respectively for maize growth which agreed with previous studies on the loess plateau bu et al 2013 liu et al 2017 zhou et al 2009 concluded pm increased swc by 10 5 22 6 in maize fields as for wheat fields pm increased soil water storage by 13 he et al 2017 plastic film could prevent water vapor exchange between soil and atmosphere and improved water vapor content under the film which would return to soil by condensation during nighttime finally increased topsoil water it is reported approximately 4 5 of the water in topsoil 0 20 cm evaporated and 72 6 of the evaporated water vapor was condensed wu et al 2017 additionally pm improved rainfall infiltration thus led to higher soil water storage zhou et al 2009 seasonal variations of glai plant height and aboveground biomass under ck and pm are presented in fig 3 glai increased significantly after 40 days after sowing das and reached maximum around 90 100 das with maximum glai of 4 46 ck and 4 90 pm m2 m 2 in 2015 and 4 69 ck and 4 75 pm m2 m 2 in 2016 after 100 das glai declined rapidly but the decrease rate of pm was larger than that of ck indicating senescence of maize in pm was earlier than that in ck as for plant height it also increased dramatically after 40 das and reached maximum around 100 das with final plant height of 235 ck and 273 pm cm in 2005 and 259 ck and 283 pm cm in 2016 in terms of aboveground biomass it increased sharply after 60 das and reached maximum around 140 das with total aboveground biomass of 25 2 ck and 28 9 pm t ha 1 in 2015 and 25 4 ck and 27 8 pm t ha 1 in 2016 glai can reflect the area of gas exchange between biosphere and atmosphere and is an important parameter controlling physical and biological processes including rainfall and light interception evapotranspiration photosynthesis carbon nitrogen and phosphorus cycling cowling and field 2003 viña et al 2011 our results indicated pm increased glai plant height and aboveground biomass as compared with those in ck maize is thermophilic crop of which photosynthesis and root activities require cumulative temperatures exceeding 10 c miedema 1982 our study found pm provided a wetter condition for maize growth previous studies also indicated pm increased soil temperature gong et al 2015 liu et al 2016 yang et al 2018 and wetter and warmer condition resulted by mulching effects led to maize growth improvement finally increased biomass accumulation 3 2 diurnal variation of maize water consumption at leaf scale maize leaf transpiration rate at filling stage on july 23 presented typical diurnal variation it reached maximum around noon and declined at 14 00 while increased again at 16 00 with mean transpiration rate of 8 2 and 9 0 mmol m 2 s 1 for ck and pm respectively fig 4 leaf transpiration had obvious midday depression for both ck and pm on july 31 transpiration also showed typical diurnal variations but it reached maximum around noon for pm while at 14 00 for ck with mean transpiration rate of 4 5 and 5 8 mmol m 2 s 1 for ck and pm respectively compared with diurnal variations of transpiration rate on july 23 no obvious midday depression of transpiration was found on july 31 maize leaf transpiration rate at maturity stage also showed increase decrease trend but it reached maximum around 10 00 then decreased gradually with mean transpiration rate of 2 7 and 3 6 mmol m 2 s 1 for ck and pm respectively compared with ck pm enhanced transpiration rate by 9 8 33 3 which is in accordance with ca et al 2007 dong et al 2009 and liang et al 2011 that plastic and straw mulch can improve crop photosynthesis mulch increases soil water and temperature thus changes leaf stomatal conductance and intercellular co2 concentration finally enhances leaf photosynthesis liang et al 2011 leaf transpiration presented typical increase decrease diurnal variations and showed obvious midday depression at filling stage on july 23 vpd and ta are high in the afternoon of sunny days therefore crops reduce leaf stomatal aperture to avoid excessive water loss which causes decrease in leaf transpiration zhang et al 2016 however compared with ck transpiration decrease for pm was more obvious this might be attributed to higher transpiration rate for pm made it more sensitive to vpd and ta fig 5 shows diurnal variations of sap flow on typical sunny cloudy and rainy days for ck and pm on sunny days from july 27 to july 31 at filling stage variations of maize sap flow were similar to that of leaf transpiration that it increased to noon then decreased with average sap flow of 33 9 and 45 6 g h 1 it should be noted that although july 30 was considered as sunny day mean global solar radiation of 291 w m 2 rapid and severe rainfall with amount of 11 5 mm was observed during 14 30 15 30 sap flow decreased significantly during rainfall period mean global solar radiation of 200 w m 2 and no obvious difference of sap flow between ck and pm was found after rainfall sap flow for ck and pm increased as global solar radiation increased 714 w m 2 on rainy days from august 14 to august 15 at filling stage sap flow for both treatments showed fluctuated increase decrease trend with mean sap flow of 5 2 and 5 6 g h 1 for ck and pm respectively on cloudy days from august 16 to august 18 at filling stage sap flow for ck and pm also presented fluctuated increase decrease trend with mean sap flow of 14 2 and 14 4 g h 1 pm enhanced water flux exchange between maize plants and atmosphere as indicated by higher transpiration rate resulting in higher maize root water uptake and more sap flow going through maize stem our results indicated pm improved sap flow by 1 4 34 5 at plant scale under different weather condition especially on sunny days et at different growth stages fig 6 all presented increase decrease variations with different magnitudes in general et increased around 07 00 08 00 and reached maximum around 12 00 14 00 then decreased to a stable level around 18 00 20 00 additionally the time when et reached maximum at seeding stage was earlier than that at other stages which might be attributed to solar radiation differences 3 3 evapotranspiration and water use efficiency seasonal variations of et and e are presented in fig 7 in general et increased after sowing and reached maximum around heading and filling stages then declined gradually for both ck and pm but the magnitudes of ck and pm were different as for e its trend was not as significant as et and e for ck was higher than that of pm table 2 shows the amount of e et kc and wue for ck and pm total e on rainless days in 2015 were 94 2 and 56 2 mm accounting for 39 9 and 23 8 of et for ck and pm respectively as for year of 2016 the amount of e on rainless days were 84 6 and 59 3 mm accounting for 42 8 and 34 9 of et respectively the results indicated pm altered the components of et as pm significantly restrained e and provided more water for maize growth daily average et were 2 19 and 2 24 mm in 2015 2 27 and 2 18 mm in 2016 for ck and pm respectively comparing the daily average et values there was no significant difference between ck and pm however total amount of et showed larger difference as pm shortened the length of growing season with total et of 326 3 and 313 9 mm in 2015 341 1 and 305 0 mm in 2016 for ck and pm respectively indicating pm decreased total et by 4 11 8 comparison of maize water consumption at different scales indicated pm increased leaf transpiration sap flow rate and t et to different extents the different extents of increase may be attributed to their different controlling variables leaf transpiration and farmland et were controlled by net radiation ta vpd and u2 however plant transpiration cannot be characterized by them possibly owing to the change of stored water in the stalk zhang et al 2016 non growing season et was 94 1 and 104 5 mm in 2015 106 6 and 107 2 mm in 2016 for ck and pm respectively indicating non growing season et only accounted for a small proportion of total et over a year regarding kc it showed no significant difference between the two treatments with values of 0 63 and 0 62 in 2015 and 0 74 and 0 69 in 2016 respectively maize yield was significantly enhanced by pm for both years p 0 05 therefore wue was also improved significantly for pm treatment p 0 05 similar to the variations of et kc fig 8 also presented typical variations that it fluctuated at low level in seeding stage and increased rapidly in shooting stage then stabilized at high level in heading and filling stage finally decreased gradually in maturity stage over the whole growing season daily kc had third order polynomial relationships with das p 0 001 with r2 of 0 64 and 0 71 in 2015 and 0 67 and 0 82 in 2016 for the two treatments respectively the results were in accordance with the variations of kc recommended by fao 56 allen et al 1998 et during the growing season plays a dominant role to determine crop yields however in rainfed croplands rainfall is not adequate to meet the et required for crop growth thus limits crop yields li et al 2013 it is reported the unproductive component of et i e e accounts for 26 54 of total et liu et al 2002 kang et al 2003 lu et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 umair et al 2017 wang et al 2018 and directly affects crop yields li et al 2013 altering et components is one of the promising ways to improve crop water use efficiency with limited water supply our results revealed e et decreased from 39 9 42 8 to 23 8 34 9 indicating pm declined the proportion of e significantly however in terms of the magnitude e et was over 20 whether for ck or pm ding et al 2013 and jiang et al 2014 reported e et of maize under pm was 8 16 which is smaller than our results the difference might be due to the differences in climates maize varieties soil textures and proportion and mulched area pm decreased e et while enhanced t et thus improved transpiration efficiency additionally pm can enhance light use efficiency kar and kumar 2007 which can lead increase in transpiration efficiency stockle and kemanian 2009 thus crop water use efficiency is further enhanced 4 conclusion the present measured maize water consumption at different scales i e leaf transpiration at leaf scale sap flow rate at plant scale and field et in plastic mulched pm and non mulched ck croplands by using portable photosynthesis system sap flow system and eddy covariance systems effects of plastic mulch on maize water consumption at different scales were investigated our study found pm provided a wetter condition for maize growth thus led to higher leaf area index plant height and aboveground biomass under pm treatment leaf transpiration sap flow and et for the two treatments all presented typical diurnal variations as it reached maximum around noon then decreased gradually pm increased leaf transpiration by 9 8 33 3 and sap flow by 1 4 34 5 under different weather conditions however seasonal et and the ratio of soil evaporation to et decreased from 326 3 341 1 mm and 39 9 42 8 under ck to 305 0 313 9 mm and 23 8 34 9 under pm respectively the results demonstrated pm declined seasonal et and altered et components and provided more water for maize growth finally resulted in significantly higher yield and water use efficiency p 0 05 acknowledgments this work was jointly

11123,plastic mulch can significantly improve soil water and temperature conditions in croplands altering ecohydrological processes in agroecosystems therefore analysis of maize water consumption in response to plastic mulch is of importance to agricultural water management a field experiment was conducted in non mulched ck and mulched pm maize fields of eastern loess plateau to monitor maize evapotranspiration at different scales portable photosynthesis system sap flow system and eddy covariance systems were utilized to measure transpiration rate at leaf scale sap flow at plant scale and evapotranspiration et at field scale respectively the results indicated pm provided a wetter condition 2 8 and 4 2 in soil water content for two growing seasons respectively for maize leading to higher leaf area index plant height and aboveground biomass under pm treatment pm increased leaf transpiration by 9 8 33 3 and sap flow by 1 4 34 5 under different weather conditions however seasonal et and the ratio of soil evaporation to et decreased from 326 3 341 1 mm and 39 9 42 8 under ck to 305 0 313 9 mm and 23 8 34 9 under pm respectively indicating pm declined seasonal et and altered et components as evaporation decreased while crop transpiration increased thus more water was used for maize growth finally resulted in significantly higher yield and water use efficiency p 0 05 our

management of dryland farming in this area keywords evapotranspiration sap flow maize water use efficiency rainfed croplands plastic mulch 1 introduction rainfed agriculture is playing and will continue to play an important role for global food supply rockström et al 2010 however increasing demand on global food mueller et al 2012 zeng et al 2018a and shortage of water resources are the primary problems rainfed agriculture encountering zhang et al 2018 the predominant rainfed area for agricultural production in china is located on the loess plateau which is famous for serious soil erosion owing to frequent heavy rainstorms and rare vegetation cover li et al 2012 water resource scarcity has led to severe environmental degradation and crop yield reduction restricting social and economic development in this area rainfall is the dominant water resource for rainfed croplands however limited rainfall to meet the seasonal water demand for crops is still challenging in rainfed agroecosystem of the loess plateau thus boosting crop water use efficiency i e making less water produce higher yield is of significance to improve the productivity of rainfed croplands daryanto et al

zhao et al 2018 ma et al 2018 altering ecohydrological processes in agroecosystems evapotranspiration et is an important component in both surface water balance and energy balance and is the nexus of water energy and carbon cycles in ecological and hydrological processes jung et al 2010 globally the amount of et is more than runoff and it returns about 60 of land precipitation back to atmosphere

analysis of the mulching effects on maize water consumption at different scales i e at leaf plant and field scales has been rarely reported especially in rainfed croplands the present study performed a field experiment to measure maize water consumption at different scales in rainfed maize croplands under non mulch ck and plastic mulch pm on the loess plateau in this experiment leaf transpiration sap flow e and field et were measured by portable photosynthesis system sap flow system micro lysimeter and eddy covariance system respectively we then investigated diurnal and seasonal variations of

interpolations however gap filling for missing or abnormal value s more than two hours were performed by mean diurnal variations average energy balance closure was 0 76 p 0 01 for ck and 0 72 p 0 01 for pm which was in accordance with results reported in previous studies allen et al 2011 tian et al 2017 all the measured meteorological and fluxes data were averaged at daily timescale in the

software sas institute cary nc at 5 level 3 results and discussion 3 1 environmental condition and crop growth fig 1 presents the dynamics of meteorological variables at the experimental site during 2015 2016 both ta and rs showed typical seasonal variations they increased from january to july then decreased gradually with mean ta of 18 and 18 c mean rs of 217 and 213 w m 2 during two growing seasons respectively table 1 u2 increased from january to may then decreased until late august and increased again over a year with mean u2 of 1 64 and 1 29 m s 1 for the two growing seasons respectively rh fluctuated from january to april and increased until late august then gradually decreased with mean rh of 60 and 68 for two growing seasons respectively vpd showed increase decrease trend over a year with mean vpd of 0 86 and 0 65 kpa for two growing seasons respectively et0 showed similar trend to u2 as u2 is the dominant climatic factor of et0 in this area fan et al 2016 with mean daily et0 of 3 50 and 3 09 mm d 1 for two growing seasons respectively total rainfall during growing seasons was 337 4 and 400 5 mm which accounted for 84 and 80 of annual rainfall respectively seasonal variations of volumetric soil water content swc under ck and pm are illustrated in fig 2 in general swc for ck and pm shared almost similar trend but swc for pm was higher than that of ck seasonal mean swc for ck and pm was 21 6 and 24 4 in 2015 and 18 2 and 22 4 in 2016 our results indicated pm provided a wetter condition 2 8 and 4 2 for two growing seasons respectively for maize growth which agreed with previous studies on the loess plateau bu et al 2013 liu et al 2017 zhou et al 2009 concluded pm increased swc by 10 5 22 6 in maize fields as for wheat fields pm increased soil water storage by 13 he et al 2017 plastic film could prevent water vapor exchange between soil and atmosphere and improved water vapor content under the film which would return to soil by condensation during nighttime finally increased topsoil water it is reported approximately 4 5 of the water in topsoil 0 20 cm evaporated and 72 6 of the evaporated water vapor was condensed wu et al 2017 additionally pm improved rainfall infiltration thus led to higher soil water storage zhou et al 2009 seasonal variations of glai plant height and aboveground biomass under ck and pm are presented in fig 3 glai increased significantly after 40 days after sowing das and reached maximum around 90 100 das with maximum glai of 4 46 ck and 4 90 pm m2 m 2 in 2015 and 4 69 ck and 4 75 pm m2 m 2 in 2016 after 100 das glai declined rapidly but the decrease rate of pm was larger than that of ck indicating senescence of maize in pm was earlier than that in ck as for plant height it also increased dramatically after 40 das and reached maximum around 100 das with final plant height of 235 ck and 273 pm cm in 2005 and 259 ck and 283 pm cm in 2016 in terms of aboveground biomass it increased sharply after 60 das and reached maximum around 140 das with total aboveground biomass of 25 2 ck and 28 9 pm t ha 1 in 2015 and 25 4 ck and 27 8 pm t ha 1 in 2016 glai can reflect the area of gas exchange between biosphere and atmosphere and is an important parameter controlling physical and biological processes including rainfall and light interception evapotranspiration photosynthesis carbon nitrogen and phosphorus cycling cowling and field 2003 viña et al 2011 our results indicated pm increased glai plant height and aboveground biomass as compared with those in ck maize is thermophilic crop of which photosynthesis and root activities require cumulative temperatures exceeding 10 c miedema 1982 our study found pm provided a wetter condition for maize growth previous studies also indicated pm increased soil temperature gong et al 2015 liu et al 2016 yang et al 2018 and wetter and warmer condition resulted by mulching effects led to maize growth improvement finally increased biomass accumulation 3 2 diurnal variation of maize water consumption at leaf scale maize leaf transpiration rate at filling stage on july 23 presented typical diurnal variation it reached maximum around noon and declined at 14 00 while increased again at 16 00 with mean transpiration rate of 8 2 and 9 0 mmol m 2 s 1 for ck and pm respectively fig 4 leaf transpiration had obvious midday depression for both ck and pm on july 31 transpiration also showed typical diurnal variations but it reached maximum around noon for pm while at 14 00 for ck with mean transpiration rate of 4 5 and 5 8 mmol m 2 s 1 for ck and pm respectively compared with diurnal variations of transpiration rate on july 23 no obvious midday depression of transpiration was found on july 31 maize leaf transpiration rate at maturity stage also showed increase decrease trend but it reached maximum around 10 00 then decreased gradually with mean transpiration rate of 2 7 and 3 6 mmol m 2 s 1 for ck and pm respectively compared with ck pm enhanced transpiration rate by 9 8 33 3 which is in accordance with ca et al 2007 dong et al 2009 and liang et al 2011 that plastic and straw mulch can improve crop photosynthesis mulch increases soil water and temperature thus changes leaf stomatal conductance and intercellular co2 concentration finally enhances leaf photosynthesis liang et al 2011 leaf transpiration presented typical increase decrease diurnal variations and showed obvious midday depression at filling stage on july 23 vpd and ta are high in the afternoon of sunny days therefore crops reduce leaf stomatal aperture to avoid excessive water loss which causes decrease in leaf transpiration zhang et al 2016 however compared with ck transpiration decrease for pm was more obvious this might be attributed to higher transpiration rate for pm made it more sensitive to vpd and ta fig 5 shows diurnal variations of sap flow on typical sunny cloudy and rainy days for ck and pm on sunny days from july 27 to july 31 at filling stage variations of maize sap flow were similar to that of leaf transpiration that it increased to noon then decreased with average sap flow of 33 9 and 45 6 g h 1 it should be noted that although july 30 was considered as sunny day mean global solar radiation of 291 w m 2 rapid and severe rainfall with amount of 11 5 mm was observed during 14 30 15 30 sap flow decreased significantly during rainfall period mean global solar radiation of 200 w m 2 and no obvious difference of sap flow between ck and pm was found after rainfall sap flow for ck and pm increased as global solar radiation increased 714 w m 2 on rainy days from august 14 to august 15 at filling stage sap flow for both treatments showed fluctuated increase decrease trend with mean sap flow of 5 2 and 5 6 g h 1 for ck and pm respectively on cloudy days from august 16 to august 18 at filling stage sap flow for ck and pm also presented fluctuated increase decrease trend with mean sap flow of 14 2 and 14 4 g h 1 pm enhanced water flux exchange between maize plants and atmosphere as indicated by higher transpiration rate resulting in higher maize root water uptake and more sap flow going through maize stem our results indicated pm improved sap flow by 1 4 34 5 at plant scale under different weather condition especially on sunny days et at different growth stages fig 6 all presented increase decrease variations with different magnitudes in general et increased around 07 00 08 00 and reached maximum around 12 00 14 00 then decreased to a stable level around 18 00 20 00 additionally the time when et reached maximum at seeding stage was earlier than that at other stages which might be attributed to solar radiation differences 3 3 evapotranspiration and water use efficiency seasonal variations of et and e are presented in fig 7 in general et increased after sowing and reached maximum around heading and filling stages then declined gradually for both ck and pm but the magnitudes of ck and pm were different as for e its trend was not as significant as et and e for ck was higher than that of pm table 2 shows the amount of e et kc and wue for ck and pm total e on rainless days in 2015 were 94 2 and 56 2 mm accounting for 39 9 and 23 8 of et for ck and pm respectively as for year of 2016 the amount of e on rainless days were 84 6 and 59 3 mm accounting for 42 8 and 34 9 of et respectively the results indicated pm altered the components of et as pm significantly restrained e and provided more water for maize growth daily average et were 2 19 and 2 24 mm in 2015 2 27 and 2 18 mm in 2016 for ck and pm respectively comparing the daily average et values there was no significant difference between ck and pm however total amount of et showed larger difference as pm shortened the length of growing season with total et of 326 3 and 313 9 mm in 2015 341 1 and 305 0 mm in 2016 for ck and pm respectively indicating pm decreased total et by 4 11 8 comparison of maize water consumption at different scales indicated pm increased leaf transpiration sap flow rate and t et to different extents the different extents of increase may be attributed to their different controlling variables leaf transpiration and farmland et were controlled by net radiation ta vpd and u2 however plant transpiration cannot be characterized by them possibly owing to the change of stored water in the stalk zhang et al 2016 non growing season et was 94 1 and 104 5 mm in 2015 106 6 and 107 2 mm in 2016 for ck and pm respectively indicating non growing season et only accounted for a small proportion of total et over a year regarding kc it showed no significant difference between the two treatments with values of 0 63 and 0 62 in 2015 and 0 74 and 0 69 in 2016 respectively maize yield was significantly enhanced by pm for both years p 0 05 therefore wue was also improved significantly for pm treatment p 0 05 similar to the variations of et kc fig 8 also presented typical variations that it fluctuated at low level in seeding stage and increased rapidly in shooting stage then stabilized at high level in heading and filling stage finally decreased gradually in maturity stage over the whole growing season daily kc had third order polynomial relationships with das p 0 001 with r2 of 0 64 and 0 71 in 2015 and 0 67 and 0 82 in 2016 for the two treatments respectively the results were in accordance with the variations of kc recommended by fao 56 allen et al 1998 et during the growing season plays a dominant role to determine crop yields however in rainfed croplands rainfall is not adequate to meet the et required for crop growth thus limits crop yields li et al 2013 it is reported the unproductive component of et i e e accounts for 26 54 of total et liu et al 2002 kang et al 2003 lu et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 umair et al 2017 wang et al 2018 and directly affects crop yields li et al 2013 altering et components is one of the promising ways to improve crop water use efficiency with limited water supply our results revealed e et decreased from 39 9 42 8 to 23 8 34 9 indicating pm declined the proportion of e significantly however in terms of the magnitude e et was over 20 whether for ck or pm ding et al 2013 and jiang et al 2014 reported e et of maize under pm was 8 16 which is smaller than our results the difference might be due to the differences in climates maize varieties soil textures and proportion and mulched area pm decreased e et while enhanced t et thus improved transpiration efficiency additionally pm can enhance light use efficiency kar and kumar 2007 which can lead increase in transpiration efficiency stockle and kemanian 2009 thus crop water use efficiency is further enhanced 4 conclusion the present measured maize water consumption at different scales i e leaf transpiration at leaf scale sap flow rate at plant scale and field et in plastic mulched pm and non mulched ck croplands by using portable photosynthesis system sap flow system and eddy covariance systems effects of plastic mulch on maize water consumption at different scales were investigated our study found pm provided a wetter condition for maize growth thus led to higher leaf area index plant height and aboveground biomass under pm treatment leaf transpiration sap flow and et for the two treatments all presented typical diurnal variations as it reached maximum around noon then decreased gradually pm increased leaf transpiration by 9 8 33 3 and sap flow by 1 4 34 5 under different weather conditions however seasonal et and the ratio of soil evaporation to et decreased from 326 3 341 1 mm and 39 9 42 8 under ck to 305 0 313 9 mm and 23 8 34 9 under pm respectively the results demonstrated pm declined seasonal et and altered et components and provided more water for maize growth finally resulted in significantly higher yield and water use efficiency p 0 05 acknowledgments this work was jointly

11124,the guizhou plateau located in southwest sw china is largely underlain by carbonate rocks and occupied by karst landscapes even though erosion rates are comparatively low soil loss is still a serious land degradation problem on this plateau because soils are generally thin grain productivity is relatively low amounts of fertilizers applied quantity of irrigation water supplied and tillage methods have changed for corn rice and wheat at the shaying watershed on the plateau during 1960 2010 so the apex model was used to simulate grain yields of the three crops and sediment yields from the three crop fields for the 50 years the purpose of this study was to evaluate the impacts of these management strategies on crop productivity and soil erosion in the watershed and thus applicability of apex in this watershed and other similar watersheds on the plateau results of 40 field experiments designed for different agricultural management strategies were selected for model calibration and validation the calibrated model was able to replicate the annual crop yields with relative root mean squared error rrmse 0 93 and nash sutclifte efficiencies 0 48 the simulated grain yields have generally increased and sediment yields have decreased with increases of the amounts of fertilizers applied and quantities of irrigation water supplied and implementation of no tillage during the 50 years the simulated sediment yields have displayed similar changes in erosion to those revealed by a record of two reservoir sediment cores within 1960 1970 1970 1980 and 1980 1990 but different ones from those within 1990 2000 the results of this study suggest that the changes in agricultural management strategies have somehow altered grain yields and sediment yields in the watershed and apex is applicable in examining the impacts of different management schemes in this and other similar watersheds on the plateau keywords model simulation fertilizer irrigation no tillage crop productivity soil erosion 1 introduction guizhou province 24 30 29 13 n 103 31 109 30 e with an area of 176 128 km2 is mostly a plateau that lies at 1000 2800 m a s l in southwest sw china fig 1 a there is a humid sub tropical monsoon climate prevailing in the region according to the data for 30 years 1981 2010 from meteorological stations in guizhou province http data cma cn the mean annual temperature is 15 77 0 43 and mean annual precipitation is 1184 95 188 12 mm however only 37 1 of the total area is covered by forest nbsc 2016 mainly because of human mediated deforestation the guizhou plateau is largely underlain by limestone dolomite and other carbonate rocks an et al 1999 pedogenesis is remarkably slow on these parent materials so the resultant soils are usually thinner than 50 cm only one third to half as thick as those developed on non carbonate bedrock under similar climate regimes in sw china moreover mountains slope steeper than 25 and relative relief greater than 200 m cover 61 7 of the plateau and karst topography accounts for 73 of the landscape an et al 1999 in many parts of the plateau thin soil patches on the sparsely vegetated steep and rugged slopes are rather easily washed away by heavy seasonal rainfall exposing local bedrock wang et al 2004 therefore soil loss remains a severe land degradation problem on the guizhou plateau though the erosion rate is low boardman 2006 at least partly due to the thinness and infertility of such soils productivity of grain crops is generally low in this province the unit area yield is only 3510 kg ha in 1997 3748 kg ha in 2005 and 3534 kg ha in 2012 for guizhou province compared to the average of 4377 kg ha 4642 kg ha and 5302 kg ha for the whole china nbsc 1998 2006 2013 moreover the grain crop productivity per capita is only 337 kg for guizhou province in 2016 while the average for the whole china is 447 kg in the same year nbsc 2013 inappropriate agricultural practices are likely to cause more serious land desertification such as soil loss and declines in soil fertility particularly in some ecologically fragile regions munro et al 2008 human mediated deforestation and some other such improper practices e g excessive wood chopping intensive land reclamation on steep slopes and long term slash and burn cultivation may have also worsened the soil loss and thus resulted in partly the low productivity of crop grains on the guizhou plateau an et al 1999 xiong et al 2012 there have been dramatic changes in agricultural management strategies in guizhou province during the past 50 years 1960 2010 compilation committee of guizhou province annals 2011 to explore if and or how these changes have affected crop growth and soil erosion would be helpful for further optimizing schemes of agricultural practices and soil conservation in this province field experiments can be a useful approach to study the responses of crop productivity and soil properties to alternative practices and are thus an effective method for assessing effects of agricultural management strategies at the plot scale however applications of such approaches at the watershed scale are often found to be costly in labor and time for data collection and at least a few years observations may be needed for meaningful and convincing conclusions davis et al 2000 hydrological gauging and other soil erosion monitoring networks cover only a few parts of the province reliable data on soil erosion particularly at relatively small spatial scales and over long time periods are generally scarce for this region one of the least developed parts in china that has long been impeding assessments of the impacts of changes in agricultural management strategies on soil erosion on the guizhou plateau it is possible to infer soil erosion in catchments where lakes reservoirs are by dating and analyzing sediments cored from these water bodies e g dearing 1991 huang and o connell 2000 even so this sediment analysis method can usually only provide qualitative or semi quantitative records of soil erosion in the catchments and its applications are also costly on the guizhou plateau wang et al 2008a 2011 luo et al 2019 apex agricultural policy environmental extender model is one of the dynamic simulation models used to determine impacts of agricultural management strategies on both grain yields and soil erosion feng et al 2019 francesconi et al 2015 tadesse et al 2018 williams and izaurralde 2006 it is a cropping system model and a multi field version of the erosion productivity impact calculator epic which simulates hydrology sediment yield soil erosion weather soil temperature and effects of pesticides and agricultural managements wang et al 2008b gassman et al 2005 provided an overview on development and application of both apex and epic the model has been expanded and refined during the past decades mbonimpa et al 2015 moriasi et al 2016 wang et al 2008b due to its wide applicability and strong capability the apex model has been extensively used to simulate grain yields irrigation management crop water production functions carbon management and sediment yields soil loss under a variety of natural and management conditions across the world van liew et al 2017 wang et al 2008b zhang et al 2016 2018 for example wang et al 2008b simulated sediment yield crop grain yield and soil organic carbon in an erosion prone area in iowa us zhang et al 2016 identified the difference between soybean yield potential fed by full irrigation and rain fed soybean yield in a humid region van liew et al 2017 evaluated grain yields and sediments under a diverse range of climatic topographic soil cover and land management conditions zhang et al 2018 determined soybean crop water production functions for the humid region however this model has been rarely applied in ecologically fragile karst regions such as the guizhou plateau sw china the shaying watershed is located in guanling county the sw guizhou plateau and is a typical karst catchment largely underlain by carbonate rocks fig 1b soil erosion studies and field experiments on grain yields have been conducted in the watershed and the county the influences of land use and land cover change lucc upon soil erosion in the whole county were investigated by wan et al 2003 a 42 year s soil erosion history was reconstructed by dating and analyzing sediments from a reservoir in the watershed wang et al 2008a field experiments for assessing the impacts of fertilization on grain yields of corn and rice have been undertaken in some parts of this county liu et al 2014 zhu et al 2014 even so reliable data on soil erosion particularly for long periods have been still generally scarce in this county as in other parts of guizhou province data on grain yields are also rare because records of agricultural production statistics are incomplete and discontinuous fortunately changes in agricultural management strategies in guanling county over 1960 2010 were recorded in local agricultural documents and literatures compilation committee of anshun city annals 1995 compilation committee of guanling county annals 2002 compilation group of comprehensive agricultural regional planning in guanling county 1995 compilation group of basic facts on guanling buyi and miao autonomous county 2008 therefore it is possible to model the impacts of agricultural management strategies on crop yield and soil erosion at the watershed scale during the past 50 years the main goal of this study was to assess the impacts of agricultural management strategies on grain yields of corn rice and wheat and sediment yields from the three crop fields at the shaying watershed in guanling county the sw guizhou plateau using apex furthermore such a study aimed at evaluating applicability of the model in this watershed and other similar watersheds on the guizhou plateau since it has been never applied in the plateau so far 2 study area guanling county 25 34 26 05 n 105 15 105 49 e with an area of 1446 km2 is located in the sw guizhou plateau fig 1b this part of the plateau is categorized as a strongly eroded region where gulley erosion has predominated an et al 1999 the shaying watershed 26 02 25 92 n 105 25 105 49 e fig 1b lies in northern guanling county the area of the whole watershed is 149 26 km2 topographical characteristics of this watershed are as shown by fig 2 a and figures listed in table 1 yellow earth and yellow brown earth developed on sandstone shale and sandy shale cover 70 9 and 3 of the total area of the catchment respectively and are relatively thick fig 2b thin calcareous soil covering 26 1 of the whole area has developed on limestone and dolomite fig 2b zonal vegetation consists mostly of sub tropical evergreen broad leaved forest however most of the natural forests have been replaced by plantation forests and farmlands particularly during the last few decades the annual precipitation is 1275 304 mm n 50 while the annual temperature is 15 9 0 42 n 50 the data from china national meteorological information center http data cma cn the rainy season lasts from june to august during which the rain falling accounts for 54 8 of the yearly total precipitation according to the 50 year s data annual evapotranspiration was estimated as 703 41 mm in running the apex model the creek flowing across the watershed referred to as hereafter the shaying stream is a first order tributary of the beipanjiang river which drains into the pearl river the third longest river in china fig 1b and c the past 50 years 1960 2010 have seen changes in land use according to our interpretation of the 2005 s remote sensing images with 30 m resolution forests have covered 35 24 of the total area of the watershed while farmlands grasslands shrub lands water and barren lands have occupied 26 26 29 74 8 57 0 13 and 0 08 respectively the crops planted in the farmlands are corn rice and wheat the area of the land where the three crops grow has accounted for 42 05 30 29 and 27 66 of the total area of the farmlands in this watershed fig 2f there is a small reservoir the shibanqiao reservoir 25 56 56 5 n 105 26 44 5 in the southeastern shaying watershed fig 1c this reservoir was built in 1958 and put into operation in 1960 currently the water depth is 7 8 m and water surface is about 0 24 km2 3 methods 3 1 model description apex is a physically based model that operates on a daily time step and is capable of performing long term simulations 1 4000 years at the whole farm or small watershed scale it has components for routing water sediment nutrients and pesticides across complex landscapes and channel systems to the watershed outlet as well as groundwater and reservoir components steglich and williams 2013 apex was constructed to evaluate various land management strategies considering sustainability erosion wind sheet and channel economics water supply and quality soil quality plant competition weather and pests williams et al 2012 to run apex at the watershed scale a specific study area is usually divided into several subareas that are relatively homogenous in terms of soil land use management and weather subareas are spatially related to one another a subarea supplies flows to another one inlet hong et al 2018 the routing mechanisms provide for evaluation of interactions between different subareas involving surface runoff sediment deposition and degradation nutrient and pesticide transport and groundwater flow williams et al 2012 williams et al 2008 have described components and functions of apex in detail here we only give a brief description on the crop growth component and soil erosion component of the model 3 1 1 crop growth component a single model is used in apex to simulate growth of all the crops each of which has unique values for the model parameters phenological development of crops is based upon daily heat unit accumulation the growth for annual crops is simulated from planting to harvesting date or until the accumulated heat units are equal to the potential heat units for the crop the model assumes that crops start to grow when the average daily air temperature exceeds their base temperature crop growth is computed with the following equation as williams et al 1989 1 h u 0 5 t m x t m n t b s c where hu daily heat unit accumulation tmx maximum of air temperature for the day tmn minimum of air temperature for the day tbsc crop specific base temperature for grains of the most crops pulse and tuber crops the economic yield is a reproductive organ williams et al 1989 the apex model uses harvest index a relatively stable parameter across a variety of conditions that is to ensure crop production neither too great to be supported by the vegetative components nor too small to guarantee the survival of the species hence crop yield is estimated using the following equation williams et al 2012 2 y l d i h i a i h e p s t f i s t l i where yld amount of the crop removed from the field t ha 1 hia harvest index used to estimate yield of the crop he machine harvest efficiency pstf simulated pest factor stl standing live biomass at harvest t ha 1 hia is calculated using the following equations 3 h i a i f a j h i i w s y f i w s y f i 4 f s w h i s w h i exp 5 563 0 0315 s w h i 5 a j h i i 100 h i i h u i i 100 h i i exp 11 11 10 h i i where ajhi the simulated potential harvest index wsyf the minimum harvest index swh the simulated water use during the fraction of the growing season mm hui the heat unit index pstf and stl are derived using a series of intermediate equations with the hu calculated with eq 1 in the apex model water stress is used to identify both the timing and duration of water limiting conditions that might result in yield difference zhang et al 2016 2018 this model regards water stress as an important factor influencing crop yield based on the theory that most grain crops are particularly sensitive to water stress from shortly before anthesis to shortly after anthesis when major yield components are determined 3 1 2 soil erosion component apex offers users seven equations to simulate rainfall runoff erosion and one of them is rusle one of the most widely used equations for estimating soil erosion renard et al 1997 in this study we selected rusle to calculate sediment yields in the apex model the rusle equation is expressed as below 6 y e i e k c v f p e s l r o k f where y sediment yield t ha 1 ei rainfall energy factor ek soil erodibility factor cvf management factor pe erosion control practice factor sl slope length and steepness factor rokf soil coarse fragment factor values of the ei ek pe and sl are calculated based on the equations of the modules of soil erosion and hydrology inserted in the apex model williams et al 2012 using the model input of daily meteorological data and topographical data and on soil characteristics and agricultural managements however values of cvf factor are derived with a series of intermediate equations as a function of above ground crop residue crop height standing live biomass of the crop and crop residue for all the days when surface runoff occurs williams and izaurralde 2006 values of rokf are estimated with the percentage of the coarse fraction of the soils 3 2 model calibration and validation with input of dem map of soil distribution land use and weather data the shaying watershed was divided into 11 homogenous subareas using the arcapex extensions based on arcgis fig 1c to ensure the credibility of simulation results it is necessary to calibrate and validate apex against field specific observations to help selecting the most suitable parameters in its application in the shaying watershed previous studies suggested that the responses of the grain crops were very sensitive to several model crop parameters including biomass energy ratio harvest index maximum lai leaf area index maximum root depth and fraction of growing season when lai started to decline wang et al 2016 williams et al 1989 zhang et al 2016 to explore the impacts of agriculture strategies on grain yield a few numbers of field experiments have been conducted during recent decades in guizhou province thus it is possible to calibrate and validate the apex model grain yields of different cultivars of a certain crop are still different therefore in the model calibration and validation we only selected results of the field experiments conducted with the cultivars which were the same or whose growths were very similar to those planted in guanling county during the past 50 years 40 field experiments using three crop cultivars qiandan corn qianyou rice guinong wheat were completed in different parts of guizhou province an et al 2016 chen et al 2009 ren et al 2009 yuan 2008 zhou et al 2011 and their results were used in the apex calibration and validation in this study van liew et al 2017 have suggested that results of two thirds of adopted field experiments should be used for model calibration while those of the remaining one third of the experiments for model validation therefore 7 11 and 9 ones of the 40 chosen field experiments were randomly picked up and results were used to calibrate crop parameters for corn rice and wheat respectively the results of the other 4 5 and 4 experiments were used for model validation for the three crops the conventional trial and error method is still widely used to calibrate runoff sediment nutrients and crop growth in running the apex model and has been proved very effective mudgal et al 2010 plotkin et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 furthermore in comparison to the manual approach some automated approaches for calibration e g apex cute tool haven t displayed remarkably improved results van liew et al 2017 thus a trial and error solution was employed in calibrating manually the crop parameters in this study the relative root mean square error rrmse legates and mccabe 1999 and nash sutcliffe model efficiency statistic ns nash and sutcliffe 1970 are the two most widely used evaluation criteria to assess model performance and have been proved very effective in most of such studies alatorre et al 2010 moriasi et al 2007 wang et al 2008b therefore both of them were used to assess the crop yields simulated for the calibration and validation rrmse is calculated with the following equation 7 r r m s e 1 1 n i 1 n o i p i 2 1 n i 1 n o i where oi observed value pi predicted value ns is calculated as shown below 8 n s 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o m e a n 2 where omean mean of observed values n number of observations ns ranges from to 1 the closer the ns value is to 1 the more efficient the model is performance of the model is usually considered satisfactory if the ns values are 0 5 moriasi et al 2007 3 3 data source the input to the apex model included daily weather data and data on soil properties crop management strategies site location and watershed characteristics these inputs were categorized into five databases namely weather database soil database crop database operation database and watershed database detailed data description and data source are given in table 2 we collected weather data from 12 meteorological stations in guizhou province http data cma cn and added them into the existing apex weather database for both model calibration and simulation by wxgn a stand alone weather generator these chinese data were used to estimate potential evaporation and

field experiments were conducted then the simulated grain yields were compared with the results of the field experiments in these sites information on land managements in the shaying watershed was obtained from historical documents and literatures including the annals and agricultural plans of guanling county agricultural management strategies amounts of fertilizers applied quantity of irrigation water supplied and tillage practices have notably changed during the past 50 years 1960 2010 the amount of chemical fertilizers applied to the croplands was small and soil nutrients were given predominantly by organic fertilizers during 1960 1970 and 1970 1980 the amount of chemical fertilizers applied began to increase gradually from the late 1970 s onwards and was thus bigger during 1980 1990 and 1990 2000 at the same time more organic fertilizers were also applied the used organic and chemical fertilizers increased from 4500 kg ha and 80 kg ha during 1960 1970 to 15 000 kg ha and 300 kg ha during 1980 1990 respectively there was no irrigation water supplied to the corn and wheat fields as there were rarely irrigation facilities operating during 1960 1970 1970 1980 and 1980 1990 from the late 1980 s onwards water storage and diversion facilities were increasingly built and put into use hence with considerable increase of irrigation water supply furrow irrigation has been carried out for the two croplands during 1990 2000 and 2000 2010 conventional tillage persisted for the three croplands until 2000 since then no tillage has replaced the conventional tillage for the corn and wheat fields with the implementation of water and soil conservation policies we parameterized changes of these management strategies furthermore we designed one scenario for each of the 5 decades namely sy 1 for 1960 1970 sy 2 for 1970 1980 sy 3 for 1980 1990 sy 4 for 1990 2000 and sy 5 for 2000 2010 based on the historical changes of the agricultural management strategies recorded in the local agricultural documents and literatures the details of the 5 scenarios are given in table 3 distributions of different types of soil and topography were considered unchanged in the watershed during the past five decades parameterized information on soil types and topography derived from the dem and soil map were applied to each of the 5 decades or scenarios fig 2a and b data on changes in areas and distributions of the corn field paddy field and wheat field in the shaying watershed were obtained by interpreting remote sense images of 1973 1987 1995 and 2005 with envi software fig 2c f according to local seniors and officials working in the relevant management agencies visited the areas and distributions of the three croplands changed little within each of the decades or even two decades lucc data collected from different literatures though sparse still somehow support such claims for example the data recorded in the annals and agricultural plans of guanling county suggest that the area of the three cultivated lands decreased only by 2 from 15 333 ha in 1982 to 15 075 ha in 1993 in the whole county thus the interpretation of 1973 1987 1995 and 2005 image have actually reflected the areas and distributions of the three croplands during 1970 1980 1980 1990 1990 2000 and 2000 2010 respectively no remote sensing images are available for the years before 1973 however areas and distributions of the three croplands didn t change significantly in the whole county during 1960 1980 as indicated by the annals of guanling county therefore the interpretation of 1973 s image may have also largely expressed the land use during 1960 1970 3 4 reservoir sediment analysis there were no observed sediment yield data that could be used to compare with or to check simulated sediment yields therefore we compared simulated soil loss with an erosion record based on analyses of sediments retrieved from the shibanqiao reservoir in the shaying watershed fig 1c to see if and how the two approach would indicate a same changing trend of soil erosion such a comparison may also give more implications on soil erosion in the study area two cores sbqsed 1 and sbq sed 2 24 and 23 cm long respectively were collected from the reservoir fig 1c in march 2003 and analyses of cesium 137 137cs activities total organic carbon toc tn total nitrogen particle size and mineral magnetism were performed wang et al 2008a 4 results 4 1 model calibration and validation the output from the calibration and validation and results of the field experiments for checking the two are listed in tables 4 and 5 the grain yields gy of the three crops simulated for the calibration were in good accordance with the results of the 27 field experiments the rrmse on the calibration for corn rice and wheat gy was 0 90 0 95 and 0 88 respectively table 5 indicating a good higher than 0 8 calibration as for ns the value on the calibration for the gy of corn rice and wheat was 0 97 0 61 and 0 69 respectively table 5 also implying a satisfactory higher than 0 5 calibration moriasi et al 2007 therefore both rrmese and ns suggest that the model calibration was acceptable for the gy of the three crops furthermore the gy simulated with the calibrated model for the validation were very close to the results of the other 13 field experiments table 5 the rrmse on the validation for the gy of the corn rice and wheat was respectively 0 93 0 94 and 0 96 higher than 0 9 while the ns value for the rice was 0 48 only slightly lower than 0 5 the relatively low value could be due to the narrow range 8 63 10 37 of the observed values for the rice field experiments used in the model validation nevertheless the ns value on the validation for the corn and wheat gy was 0 75 and 0 87 table 5 respectively the values of the gy simulated for calibration and validation were compared with the observed values from the field experiments fig 3 all the simulated values were highly correlated and similar to their corresponding observed values with r2 larger than 0 76 p 0 1 therefore the performance of the calibrated model was generally satisfactory in simulating gy of corn rice and wheat furthermore since crop growth were simulated satisfactorily for the shaying watershed the c factor in rusle closely related to plant cover could also be calculated reasonably thus the calibrated apex model may be also capable of simulating sediment yields effectively in the same watershed by recalculating the daily c factor 4 2 simulated grain yields for the past 50 years the simulated gy of the three crops in the shaying watershed are displayed in fig 4 a c the analysis of variance anova and multiple comparison analysis by the fisher s least significant difference lsd indicate that there were significant differences between the gy simulated for different scenarios in most cases table 6 however the differences were not significant between the gy of the corn rice and wheat for sy 1 and sy 2 neither were the ones between the gy of the rice and wheat for sy 4 and sy 5 table 6 the average corn gy for each decade was 0 83 1 51 3 64 6 33 and 8 59 t ha respectively fig 4a so as also implied by the anova and lsd analysis table 6 the gy of the corn increased persistently since 1980 and was the highest during 2000 2010 the average gy of rice simulated under the 5 scenarios was 2 36 2 20 5 09 7 35 and 7 79 t ha for the 5 decades respectively fig 4b similar to the case of the gy of the corn the rice gy also began to increase remarkably since 1980 the rice sy was significantly higher during 1990 2000 and 2000 2010 than during any one of the previous decades table 6 however the difference between the gy for the latest two decades was insignificant table 6 the 10 year s average wheat gy simulated with the sy 1 sy 2 sy 3 sy 4 and sy 5 was 1 70 2 08 4 88 5 93 and 6 50 t ha respectively fig 4c once again the significant increase of the wheat gy also started since 1980 and the average gy for 1990 2000 and 2000 2010 were significantly higher table 6 nevertheless there were no significant differences between the wheat gy for the two decades table 6 therefore the apex modeling suggests that the gy of the three crops have increased in general over the past 50 years implying a positive impact of the land management on the gy the simulated crop yields in the 11 subareas over the past 50 years are presented in fig 5 in different subareas variations in the simulated gy of corn rice and wheat displayed similar temporal trends within each of the decades and over the 50 years fig 5 so the gy of the three crops were all closely related to changes in agriculture management strategies in each of the subareas subarea 8 9 and 10 are mostly covered by calcareous soil while the other subareas are underlain with yellow earth fig 2b the gy of the corn was higher in the subareas underlain by the yellow earth than those by the calcareous soil for each year fig 5 though the differences were insignificant for the rice the gy was significantly higher in the yellow earth s subareas than in the calcareous soil s ones during 1990 2010 p 0 05 during all the five decades p 0 1 and particularly 1990 2010 p 0 05 the wheat gy was always significantly higher in the subareas covered by the yellow earth than in the ones by the calcareous soil fig 5 studies have suggested that fertilizer efficiency and biological accumulation are higher in the yellow earth than in calcareous soil on the guizhou plateau liao and long 1997 liu 2009 we thus temporally ascribed the higher gy of the crops planted on the yellow earth to the relatively high total nitrogen content and organic matter content of this type of soil 4 3 simulated sediment yields for the past 50 years the simulated sediment yields from the corn fields paddy fields and wheat fields in the shaying watershed are displayed in fig 4d f with both anova and multiple comparison analysis significance of the inter decade difference in the sediment yield was also checked for each of the three crop fields table 6 in the corn fields the average sediment yield was respectively 8 41 7 67 4 19 3 94 and 0 44 t ha for 1960 1970 1970 1980 1980 1990 1990 2000 and 2000 2010 fig 4d thus erosion begun to decline significantly since 1980 while the minimal erosion occurred during 2000 2010 as also indicated by the anova and multiple comparison analysis table 6 the simulated sediment yield was 9 49 10 54 6 82 6 14 and 6 65 t ha respectively in the rice fields for the five decades or sy 1 sy 2 sy 3 sy 4 and sy 5 fig 4e the average sediment yield for 1980 1990 1990 2000 and 2000 2010 was significantly different from and lower than the one for 1960 1970 and 1970 1980 table 6 and fig 4e so the soil erosion in the paddy fields started to decline since 1980 and was obviously weaker during the three later decades the average sediment yield in the wheat fields was 7 05 7 19 5 21 5 11 and 1 12 t ha for the 5 scenarios or decades fig 4f the difference between the sediment yields for sy 1 and sy 2 was not significant neither was the one between the sediment yield for sy 3 and sy 4 table 6 even so the sediment yield for sy 3 was significantly lower than the one for sy 2 table 6 and fig 4f furthermore the sediment yield in the wheat fields for sy 5 was still significantly different from and much lower than the one for each of the other four scenarios table 6 and fig 4f therefore soil erosion begun to decline remarkably in the wheat fields since 1980 and was the weakest during 2000 2010 on the whole soil erosion in both the corn fields and wheat fields was the minimal during 2000 2010 while the erosion has been persistently weak since 1980 in all the three croplands the values of the sediment yield in corn and wheat fields are comparatively lower and closer to the natural or geological erosion rates nearing et al 2017 one of the possible reasons is that the crop growth has increased the vegetation coverage and thus reduced soil erosion in the two crop fields for example the greatly promoted growth of the corn as implied by its highest gy may have largely increased the vegetation coverage and minimized the sediment yield in the corn field during 2000 2010 fig 4a and d spatial distributions of the sediment yields simulated are presented for each of the decades fig 6 for the convenience of describing the spatial patterns the erosion was classified into 5 categories based on the sediment yield simulated very slight erosion 0 4 t ha slight erosion 4 6 t ha moderate erosion 6 8 t ha strong erosion 8 10 t ha and very strong erosion 10 t ha soil erosion was the most intensive during 1960 1970 fig 6a the area of the cropland where the strong erosion and very strong erosion occurred was 1540 71 and 549 78 ha accounting for 53 47 and 19 11 of the total cropland of the watershed during this decade table 7 meanwhile the area of the cropland at which the slight and very slight erosion took place was only 144 96 ha accounting for 5 04 of the total farmland table 7 soil erosion declined somewhat during 1970 1980 fig 6b during this decade the cropland area of the strong and very strong erosion and its percentage decreased to 1244 43 and 259 35 ha and 48 27 and 10 06 respectively table 7 the summed area of the croplands of the slight and very slight erosion and its percentage increased to 336 93 ha and 13 07 in this decade table 7 during 1980 1990 the area of the strong and very strong erosion further shrank fig 6c and table 7 at the same time the area of the moderate and slight erosion 2136 13 and 859 21 ha and its percentage 67 and 26 98 increased fig 6c and table 7 afterwards soil erosion continued to decline during the subsequent decade 1990 2000 fig 6d the area of the slight and very slight erosion was 549 78 and 1540 71 ha accounting for 19 11 and 53 57 of the total area of the cropland table 7 during 2000 2010 soil erosion was the weakest fig 6e the area of the slight and very slight erosion increased to 259 52 and 1921 78 ha accounting for 10 07 and 74 54 of the total cropland during the most recent decade table 7 the spatial patterns of soil loss were generally similar during the five decades fig 6 erosion was often relatively intense in the southeast part of the watershed e g subarea 11 while erosion was usually rather slight in the central south e g subarea 8 and 9 5 discussion 5 1 impacts of management strategies on grain yield and soil erosion 5 1 1 increase of amount of fertilizers applied as expected the gy simulated by the model increased with the increase of the amount of fertilizers applied in the croplands during 1960 1970 and 1970 1980 the amount of fertilizers used in the fields of corn rice and wheat was small compilation committee of guanling county annals 2002 therefore the gy of the three crops were low fig 4a c in fact during the first two decades soil nutrients of the croplands were provided mainly by farmyard manure in guanling county the amount of chemical fertilizers applied was generally small until the late 1970 s in the farmlands in this county the chemical fertilizers used were only 1400 t each year during the 1960 s and early and mid 1970 s since the late 1970 s the amount of the chemical fertilizers used began to increase persistently and reached 6000 t in 2004 in addition biogas digestate also began to be used as manures since 1987 compilation group of basic facts on guanling buyi and miao autonomous county 2008 till 2002 totally 3250 pits were put into use to produce methane the by product biogas digestate was largely applied as manure in the farmlands crop potential growth can be facilitated when the crop is supplied with enough nutrients carey et al 2012 increased nitrogen input level can significantly increase grain yields biomass and harvest index agegnehu et al 2016 srivastava et al 2018 therefore the gy of the three crops began to increase from 1980 onwards with the increase of the applied amount of chemical fertilizers and organic fertilizers and were generally high since then fig 4a c the corn gy of 2000 2010 were raised by 7 62 times as against 1960 1970 in the shaying watershed fig 4a and the rice and wheat gy increased more than 3 times fig 4b and c the average sediment yields of 1980 1990 1990 2000 and 2000 2010 decreased by 33 34 and 70 compared to 1960 1970 respectively fig 4d f previous studies have suggested that appropriate increases of amounts of fertilizers applied may somehow alter physical and chemical properties of soils and thus reduce erosion geisseler and scow 2014 nest et al 2014 in addition increases of rate of fertilizer application may also raise nutrient s availability and water use efficiency in soils and thus promote crop growth gaiser et al 2004 increasing vegetation coverage and reducing erosion therefore the declining of soil erosion starting at 1980 could be also attributed to the raised input of the fertilizers 5 1 2 developments of irrigation systems the average gy of the corn rice and wheat further increased since 1990 and was thus significantly higher during 1990 2000 and 2000 2010 than during 1980 1990 fig 4a c and table 6 there were no irrigation systems at all and the crop fields were fed completely by rain in the watershed during 1960 1970 1970 1980 and 1980 1990 from the late 1980 s onwards irrigation systems began to be built compilation committee of guanling county annals 2002 compilation committee of guizhou province annals 2011 till 1998 up to 135 water storage and 652 water diversion projects were completed and put into use these facilities supplied irrigation water of about 9764 m3 to the corn and wheat fields each year during 1990 2000 and 2000 2010 crop yields are usually influenced by water availability most crops are particularly sensitive to water stress in the key stages when major yield components are determined doorenbos and kassam 1979 the main growth months are june july and august or summer months for most crops on the guizhou plateau the average of annual precipitation was 1298 5 1361 5 1280 1 1268 1 and 1184 mm for 1960 1970 1970 1980 1980 1990 1990 2000 and 2000 2010 respectively the average of summer precipitation was respectively 714 1 692 4 691 5 711 and 662 6 mm for the five decades there were no significant inter decade differences between the average of annual precipitation neither were there ones between those of summer precipitation p 0 1 thus the further increase of the gy happening since 1990 could be at least partly ascribed to the great quantity of water supplied by the irrigation systems the increases of available water resulting from wide operation of irrigation systems may have increased surface runoff in the farmlands during 1990 2000 however the sediment yield from the corn fields and wheat fields didn t increase at all fig 4d and f instead though not significantly the sediment yield from the two croplands even decreased by 6 and 2 respectively during 1990 2000 compared to 1980 1990 fig 4d and f and table 6 that was probably because the increased water promoted growth of the crops and hence increased vegetation coverage and decreased erosion 5 1 3 implementation of no tillage since 2002 no tillage and reduced tillage has been gradually implemented in the whole county huang et al 2011 the gy of corn increased by 36 during 2000 2010 compared to 1990 2000 fig 4a the gy of the rice and wheat only slightly increased during 2000 2010 and was not significantly from the one during 1990 2000 fig 4b and c and table 6 the amounts of fertilizers applied for each year were generally the same during 1990 2000 and 2000 2010 during the two decades the operation of irrigation systems was almost equally common in the county compilation committee of guanling county annals 2002 compilation committee of guizhou province annals 2011 thus the higher gy particularly those of the corn were predominately due to the implementation of the no tillage measure during 2000 2010 no tillage has been often considered as a management measure to sustain soil productivity the benefits of no tillage have been also reported in other studies mitchell et al 2017 found that adoption of no tillage may benefit soil health by improving chemical physical and biological characteristics of soil functions denardin et al 2019 demonstrated that the no tillage has led to higher organic matter of soils than conventional tillage and thus increased crop yield the no tillage combined with effective herbicide can increase grain yields from 10 to 30 percentage based on the field experiments in guizhou province wu et al 1991 therefore the no tillage could result in better soil nutrient conditions which increased gy of the three crops in the shaying watershed the implementation of the no tillage also decreased the sediment yield remarkably since 2000 compared to 1990 2000 the simulated sediment yield decreased by 92 from the corn fields and 81 from the wheat fields respectively during 2000 2010 fig 4d and f mhazo et al 2016 checked data on sediment yield for 282 paired no tilled and conventionally tilled runoff plots worldwide and concluded tillage abandonment have decreased sediment yield by 60 richardson and king 1995 also found that no tillage practice may enhance the soil retention capability of plowing layer under no tillage conditions many crop residues could be left on the surface of farmlands and thus have somehow protected soil from being eroded therefore the dramatic declining of erosion in the corn and wheat fields has been largely caused by the implementation of the no tillage during 2000 2010 5 2 comparing the simulated sediment yields with an erosion record of reservoir sediments the 137cs activities provided a chronological framework for the two sediment cores sbqsed 1 and sbq 2 from the shibanqiao reservoir fig 7 particle size of sediments of lakes reservoirs has been usually used as an indictor of intensity of soil erosion i e coarser particles imply intensified soil erosion and finer ones hint at declined erosion dearing 1997 schmidt et al 2002 chen et al 2004 variations in particle size of the cores appear to have straightforwardly reflected changes of the soil erosion in the catchment of the reservoir during 1960 2002 wang et al 2008a hence the mean particle size of the two cores have been compared with the sediment yields simulated fig 7 particularly as shown by the comparison between the summed sediment yields fig 7d and mean particle size of the reservoir sediments fig 7e and f the two methods have actually indicated very similar variations in soil erosion within each of the earlier three decades 1960 1970 1970 1980 and 1980 1990 the higher annual sediment yield simulated was often corresponding to the coarser particles of the two cores while the lower annual sediment yield to the finer ones during 1960 1990 fig 7e and f the simulated sediment yields began to decrease from 1980 onwards fig 7d particles of the reservoir sediments have simultaneously become finer as shown by the mean particle size data and particularly those of sbqsed 2 fig 7f the reservoir sediment record theoretically reflected the total erosion in the whole sub basin while the sediment yield simulated by apex was only a manifestation of the erosion in the corn rice and wheat fields thus the agreement suggests that the changes in the total erosion in the sub basin were largely controlled by those in the erosion in the three crop fields during 1960 1970 1970 1980 and 1980 1990 such consistency between the variations in the mean particle size of the reservoir sediments and simulated sediment yield also somehow prove that apex was reliable for simulating erosion for the three decades variations in the mean particle size indicate that the erosion considerably intensified in the entire sub basin during 1990 2000 fig 7d f however the sediment yield simulated for 1990 2000 decreased implying declining erosion fig 7a d a massive afforestation was initiated in 1993 and forestlands of 22 130 mu 1460 ha thus increased since then in the whole county compilation committee of guanling county annals 2002 compilation committee of guizhou province annals 2011 nevertheless the newly planted young trees were incapable of protecting soils from being eroded at the beginning the soils were considerably loosened and more vulnerable to erosion in the reclaimed land mainly grasslands and barren lands where the trees were being planted other studies have also suggested that land reclamation may result in severe soil erosion at its earlier stage porto et al 2009 jia et al 2017 therefore the gross erosion didn t decline and instead intensified during the initial stage of the massive afforestation in the whole sub basin though the erosion occurring in the three croplands declined 6 conclusions calibration and validation indicate that the apex model can reasonably simulate gy of corn rice and wheat commonly planted in the shaying watershed a small catchment underlain largely by carbonate rocks on the sw guizhou plateau changes in agricultural managements have to different extent influenced the gy and soil erosion for different crops in this watershed the increase of the amount of the chemical fertilizers beginning around 1980 significantly increased the gy of the corn rice and wheat and decreased the sediment yields in the three crop fields the increase of the quantity of the irrigation water starting around 1990 further raised gy of the three crops and slightly reduced the sediment yields from the croplands the no tillage implemented during 2000 2010 significantly increased the gy of the corn and decreased the sediment yield in the corn fields and wheat fields during this decade the impacts of the no tillage implementation were insignificant on the gy of the rice and wheat and sediment yields in the paddy fields particle size of the sediments sampled from a reservoir and simulated sediment yield suggest very similar changes in soil erosion within each of the earlier three decades 1960 1970 1970 1980 and 1980 1990 thus the changes in the erosion in the whole reservoir s catchment were probably mainly controlled by those in the erosion taking placing in the fields of the three crops during the three decades such coincidence of the apex modeling with sediment analysis may also imply the reliability of the sediment yield simulation the reservoir sediment record and apex modeling indicate different changes in erosion during 1990 2000 which could be attributed to intensification of the erosion in the uncultivated land caused by human activities all the results aforementioned have revealed how the changes in agricultural management strategies could have influenced both grain yields and sediment yields in the shaying watershed furthermore these results have also implied that the apex model is applicable in evaluating impacts of varying management strategies on crop productivity and soil erosion in this and other similar watersheds on the guizhou plateau

greatly improved the manuscript 
11124,the guizhou plateau located in southwest sw china is largely underlain by carbonate rocks and occupied by karst landscapes even though erosion rates are comparatively low soil loss is still a serious land degradation problem on this plateau because soils are generally thin grain productivity is relatively low amounts of fertilizers applied quantity of irrigation water supplied and tillage methods have changed for corn rice and wheat at the shaying watershed on the plateau during 1960 2010 so the apex model was used to simulate grain yields of the three crops and sediment yields from the three crop fields for the 50 years the purpose of this study was to evaluate the impacts of these management strategies on crop productivity and soil erosion in the watershed and thus applicability of apex in this watershed and other similar watersheds on the plateau results of 40 field experiments designed for different agricultural management strategies were selected for model calibration and validation the calibrated model was able to replicate the annual crop yields with relative root mean squared error rrmse 0 93 and nash sutclifte efficiencies 0 48 the simulated grain yields have generally increased and sediment yields have decreased with increases of the amounts of fertilizers applied and quantities of irrigation water supplied and implementation of no tillage during the 50 years the simulated sediment yields have displayed similar changes in erosion to those revealed by a record of two reservoir sediment cores within 1960 1970 1970 1980 and 1980 1990 but different ones from those within 1990 2000 the results of this study suggest that the changes in agricultural management strategies have somehow altered grain yields and sediment yields in the watershed and apex is applicable in examining the impacts of different management schemes in this and other similar watersheds on the plateau keywords model simulation fertilizer irrigation no tillage crop productivity soil erosion 1 introduction guizhou province 24 30 29 13 n 103 31 109 30 e with an area of 176 128 km2 is mostly a plateau that lies at 1000 2800 m a s l in southwest sw china fig 1 a there is a humid sub tropical monsoon climate prevailing in the region according to the data for 30 years 1981 2010 from meteorological stations in guizhou province http data cma cn the mean annual temperature is 15 77 0 43 and mean annual precipitation is 1184 95 188 12 mm however only 37 1 of the total area is covered by forest nbsc 2016 mainly because of human mediated deforestation the guizhou plateau is largely underlain by limestone dolomite and other carbonate rocks an et al 1999 pedogenesis is remarkably slow on these parent materials so the resultant soils are usually thinner than 50 cm only one third to half as thick as those developed on non carbonate bedrock under similar climate regimes in sw china moreover mountains slope steeper than 25 and relative relief greater than 200 m cover 61 7 of the plateau and karst topography accounts for 73 of the landscape an et al 1999 in many parts of the plateau thin soil patches on the sparsely vegetated steep and rugged slopes are rather easily washed away by heavy seasonal rainfall exposing local bedrock wang et al 2004 therefore soil loss remains a severe land degradation problem on the guizhou plateau though the erosion rate is low boardman 2006 at least partly due to the thinness and infertility of such soils productivity of grain crops is generally low in this province the unit area yield is only 3510 kg ha in 1997 3748 kg ha in 2005 and 3534 kg ha in 2012 for guizhou province compared to the average of 4377 kg ha 4642 kg ha and 5302 kg ha for the whole china nbsc 1998 2006 2013 moreover the grain crop productivity per capita is only 337 kg for guizhou province in 2016 while the average for the whole china is 447 kg in the same year nbsc 2013 inappropriate agricultural practices are likely to cause more serious land desertification such as soil loss and declines in soil fertility particularly in some ecologically fragile regions munro et al 2008 human mediated deforestation and some other such improper practices e g excessive wood chopping intensive land reclamation on steep slopes and long term slash and burn cultivation may have also worsened the soil loss and thus resulted in partly the low productivity of crop grains on the guizhou plateau an et al 1999 xiong et al 2012 there have been dramatic changes in agricultural management strategies in guizhou province during the past 50 years 1960 2010 compilation committee of guizhou province annals 2011 to explore if and or how these changes have affected crop growth and soil erosion would be helpful for further optimizing schemes of agricultural practices and soil conservation in this province field experiments can be a useful approach to study the responses of crop productivity and soil properties to alternative practices and are thus an effective method for assessing effects of agricultural management strategies at the plot scale however applications of such approaches at the watershed scale are often found to be costly in labor and time for data collection and at least a few years observations may be needed for meaningful and convincing conclusions davis et al 2000 hydrological gauging and other soil erosion monitoring networks cover only a few parts of the province reliable data on soil erosion particularly at relatively small spatial scales and over long time periods are generally scarce for this region one of the least developed parts in china that has long been impeding assessments of the impacts of changes in agricultural management strategies on soil erosion on the guizhou plateau it is possible to infer soil erosion in catchments where lakes reservoirs are by dating and analyzing sediments cored from these water bodies e g dearing 1991 huang and o connell 2000 even so this sediment analysis method can usually only provide qualitative or semi quantitative records of soil erosion in the catchments and its applications are also costly on the guizhou plateau wang et al 2008a 2011 luo et al 2019 apex agricultural policy environmental extender model is one of the dynamic simulation models used to determine impacts of agricultural management strategies on both grain yields and soil erosion feng et al 2019 francesconi et al 2015 tadesse et al 2018 williams and izaurralde 2006 it is a cropping system model and a multi field version of the erosion productivity impact calculator epic which simulates hydrology sediment yield soil erosion weather soil temperature and effects of pesticides and agricultural managements wang et al 2008b gassman et al 2005 provided an overview on development and application of both apex and epic the model has been expanded and refined during the past decades mbonimpa et al 2015 moriasi et al 2016 wang et al 2008b due to its wide applicability and strong capability the apex model has been extensively used to simulate grain yields irrigation management crop water production functions carbon management and sediment yields soil loss under a variety of natural and management conditions across the world van liew et al 2017 wang et al 2008b zhang et al 2016 2018 for example wang et al 2008b simulated sediment yield crop grain yield and soil organic carbon in an erosion prone area in iowa us zhang et al 2016 identified the difference between soybean yield potential fed by full irrigation and rain fed soybean yield in a humid region van liew et al 2017 evaluated grain yields and sediments under a diverse range of climatic topographic soil cover and land management conditions zhang et al 2018 determined soybean crop water production functions for the humid region however this model has been rarely applied in ecologically fragile karst regions such as the guizhou plateau sw china the shaying watershed is located in guanling county the sw guizhou plateau and is a typical karst catchment largely underlain by carbonate rocks fig 1b soil erosion studies and field experiments on grain yields have been conducted in the watershed and the county the influences of land use and land cover change lucc upon soil erosion in the whole county were investigated by wan et al 2003 a 42 year s soil erosion history was reconstructed by dating and analyzing sediments from a reservoir in the watershed wang et al 2008a field experiments for assessing the impacts of fertilization on grain yields of corn and rice have been undertaken in some parts of this county liu et al 2014 zhu et al 2014 even so reliable data on soil erosion particularly for long periods have been still generally scarce in this county as in other parts of guizhou province data on grain yields are also rare because records of agricultural production statistics are incomplete and discontinuous fortunately changes in agricultural management strategies in guanling county over 1960 2010 were recorded in local agricultural documents and literatures compilation committee of anshun city annals 1995 compilation committee of guanling county annals 2002 compilation group of comprehensive agricultural regional planning in guanling county 1995 compilation group of basic facts on guanling buyi and miao autonomous county 2008 therefore it is possible to model the impacts of agricultural management strategies on crop yield and soil erosion at the watershed scale during the past 50 years the main goal of this study was to assess the impacts of agricultural management strategies on grain yields of corn rice and wheat and sediment yields from the three crop fields at the shaying watershed in guanling county the sw guizhou plateau using apex furthermore such a study aimed at evaluating applicability of the model in this watershed and other similar watersheds on the guizhou plateau since it has been never applied in the plateau so far 2 study area guanling county 25 34 26 05 n 105 15 105 49 e with an area of 1446 km2 is located in the sw guizhou plateau fig 1b this part of the plateau is categorized as a strongly eroded region where gulley erosion has predominated an et al 1999 the shaying watershed 26 02 25 92 n 105 25 105 49 e fig 1b lies in northern guanling county the area of the whole watershed is 149 26 km2 topographical characteristics of this watershed are as shown by fig 2 a and figures listed in table 1 yellow earth and yellow brown earth developed on sandstone shale and sandy shale cover 70 9 and 3 of the total area of the catchment respectively and are relatively thick fig 2b thin calcareous soil covering 26 1 of the whole area has developed on limestone and dolomite fig 2b zonal vegetation consists mostly of sub tropical evergreen broad leaved forest however most of the natural forests have been replaced by plantation forests and farmlands particularly during the last few decades the annual precipitation is 1275 304 mm n 50 while the annual temperature is 15 9 0 42 n 50 the data from china national meteorological information center http data cma cn the rainy season lasts from june to august during which the rain falling accounts for 54 8 of the yearly total precipitation according to the 50 year s data annual evapotranspiration was estimated as 703 41 mm in running the apex model the creek flowing across the watershed referred to as hereafter the shaying stream is a first order tributary of the beipanjiang river which drains into the pearl river the third longest river in china fig 1b and c the past 50 years 1960 2010 have seen changes in land use according to our interpretation of the 2005 s remote sensing images with 30 m resolution forests have covered 35 24 of the total area of the watershed while farmlands grasslands shrub lands water and barren lands have occupied 26 26 29 74 8 57 0 13 and 0 08 respectively the crops planted in the farmlands are corn rice and wheat the area of the land where the three crops grow has accounted for 42 05 30 29 and 27 66 of the total area of the farmlands in this watershed fig 2f there is a small reservoir the shibanqiao reservoir 25 56 56 5 n 105 26 44 5 in the southeastern shaying watershed fig 1c this reservoir was built in 1958 and put into operation in 1960 currently the water depth is 7 8 m and water surface is about 0 24 km2 3 methods 3 1 model description apex is a physically based model that operates on a daily time step and is capable of performing long term simulations 1 4000 years at the whole farm or small watershed scale it has components for routing water sediment nutrients and pesticides across complex landscapes and channel systems to the watershed outlet as well as groundwater and reservoir components steglich and williams 2013 apex was constructed to evaluate various land management strategies considering sustainability erosion wind sheet and channel economics water supply and quality soil quality plant competition weather and pests williams et al 2012 to run apex at the watershed scale a specific study area is usually divided into several subareas that are relatively homogenous in terms of soil land use management and weather subareas are spatially related to one another a subarea supplies flows to another one inlet hong et al 2018 the routing mechanisms provide for evaluation of interactions between different subareas involving surface runoff sediment deposition and degradation nutrient and pesticide transport and groundwater flow williams et al 2012 williams et al 2008 have described components and functions of apex in detail here we only give a brief description on the crop growth component and soil erosion component of the model 3 1 1 crop growth component a single model is used in apex to simulate growth of all the crops each of which has unique values for the model parameters phenological development of crops is based upon daily heat unit accumulation the growth for annual crops is simulated from planting to harvesting date or until the accumulated heat units are equal to the potential heat units for the crop the model assumes that crops start to grow when the average daily air temperature exceeds their base temperature crop growth is computed with the following equation as williams et al 1989 1 h u 0 5 t m x t m n t b s c where hu daily heat unit accumulation tmx maximum of air temperature for the day tmn minimum of air temperature for the day tbsc crop specific base temperature for grains of the most crops pulse and tuber crops the economic yield is a reproductive organ williams et al 1989 the apex model uses harvest index a relatively stable parameter across a variety of conditions that is to ensure crop production neither too great to be supported by the vegetative components nor too small to guarantee the survival of the species hence crop yield is estimated using the following equation williams et al 2012 2 y l d i h i a i h e p s t f i s t l i where yld amount of the crop removed from the field t ha 1 hia harvest index used to estimate yield of the crop he machine harvest efficiency pstf simulated pest factor stl standing live biomass at harvest t ha 1 hia is calculated using the following equations 3 h i a i f a j h i i w s y f i w s y f i 4 f s w h i s w h i exp 5 563 0 0315 s w h i 5 a j h i i 100 h i i h u i i 100 h i i exp 11 11 10 h i i where ajhi the simulated potential harvest index wsyf the minimum harvest index swh the simulated water use during the fraction of the growing season mm hui the heat unit index pstf and stl are derived using a series of intermediate equations with the hu calculated with eq 1 in the apex model water stress is used to identify both the timing and duration of water limiting conditions that might result in yield difference zhang et al 2016 2018 this model regards water stress as an important factor influencing crop yield based on the theory that most grain crops are particularly sensitive to water stress from shortly before anthesis to shortly after anthesis when major yield components are determined 3 1 2 soil erosion component apex offers users seven equations to simulate rainfall runoff erosion and one of them is rusle one of the most widely used equations for estimating soil erosion renard et al 1997 in this study we selected rusle to calculate sediment yields in the apex model the rusle equation is expressed as below 6 y e i e k c v f p e s l r o k f where y sediment yield t ha 1 ei rainfall energy factor ek soil erodibility factor cvf management factor pe erosion control practice factor sl slope length and steepness factor rokf soil coarse fragment factor values of the ei ek pe and sl are calculated based on the equations of the modules of soil erosion and hydrology inserted in the apex model williams et al 2012 using the model input of daily meteorological data and topographical data and on soil characteristics and agricultural managements however values of cvf factor are derived with a series of intermediate equations as a function of above ground crop residue crop height standing live biomass of the crop and crop residue for all the days when surface runoff occurs williams and izaurralde 2006 values of rokf are estimated with the percentage of the coarse fraction of the soils 3 2 model calibration and validation with input of dem map of soil distribution land use and weather data the shaying watershed was divided into 11 homogenous subareas using the arcapex extensions based on arcgis fig 1c to ensure the credibility of simulation results it is necessary to calibrate and validate apex against field specific observations to help selecting the most suitable parameters in its application in the shaying watershed previous studies suggested that the responses of the grain crops were very sensitive to several model crop parameters including biomass energy ratio harvest index maximum lai leaf area index maximum root depth and fraction of growing season when lai started to decline wang et al 2016 williams et al 1989 zhang et al 2016 to explore the impacts of agriculture strategies on grain yield a few numbers of field experiments have been conducted during recent decades in guizhou province thus it is possible to calibrate and validate the apex model grain yields of different cultivars of a certain crop are still different therefore in the model calibration and validation we only selected results of the field experiments conducted with the cultivars which were the same or whose growths were very similar to those planted in guanling county during the past 50 years 40 field experiments using three crop cultivars qiandan corn qianyou rice guinong wheat were completed in different parts of guizhou province an et al 2016 chen et al 2009 ren et al 2009 yuan 2008 zhou et al 2011 and their results were used in the apex calibration and validation in this study van liew et al 2017 have suggested that results of two thirds of adopted field experiments should be used for model calibration while those of the remaining one third of the experiments for model validation therefore 7 11 and 9 ones of the 40 chosen field experiments were randomly picked up and results were used to calibrate crop parameters for corn rice and wheat respectively the results of the other 4 5 and 4 experiments were used for model validation for the three crops the conventional trial and error method is still widely used to calibrate runoff sediment nutrients and crop growth in running the apex model and has been proved very effective mudgal et al 2010 plotkin et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 furthermore in comparison to the manual approach some automated approaches for calibration e g apex cute tool haven t displayed remarkably improved results van liew et al 2017 thus a trial and error solution was employed in calibrating manually the crop parameters in this study the relative root mean square error rrmse legates and mccabe 1999 and nash sutcliffe model efficiency statistic ns nash and sutcliffe 1970 are the two most widely used evaluation criteria to assess model performance and have been proved very effective in most of such studies alatorre et al 2010 moriasi et al 2007 wang et al 2008b therefore both of them were used to assess the crop yields simulated for the calibration and validation rrmse is calculated with the following equation 7 r r m s e 1 1 n i 1 n o i p i 2 1 n i 1 n o i where oi observed value pi predicted value ns is calculated as shown below 8 n s 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o m e a n 2 where omean mean of observed values n number of observations ns ranges from to 1 the closer the ns value is to 1 the more efficient the model is performance of the model is usually considered satisfactory if the ns values are 0 5 moriasi et al 2007 3 3 data source the input to the apex model included daily weather data and data on soil properties crop management strategies site location and watershed characteristics these inputs were categorized into five databases namely weather database soil database crop database operation database and watershed database detailed data description and data source are given in table 2 we collected weather data from 12 meteorological stations in guizhou province http data cma cn and added them into the existing apex weather database for both model calibration and simulation by wxgn a stand alone weather generator these chinese data were used to estimate potential evaporation and evapotranspiration with penman monteith method allen et al 1998 the main equation of the method is shown as follows 9 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where et0 potential

field experiments were conducted then the simulated grain yields were compared with the results of the field experiments in these sites information on land managements in the shaying watershed was obtained from historical documents and literatures including the annals and agricultural plans of guanling county agricultural management strategies amounts of fertilizers applied quantity of irrigation water supplied and tillage practices have notably changed during the past 50 years 1960 2010 the amount of chemical fertilizers applied to the croplands was small and soil nutrients were given predominantly by organic fertilizers during 1960 1970 and 1970 1980 the amount of chemical fertilizers applied began to increase gradually from the late 1970 s onwards and was thus bigger during 1980 1990 and 1990 2000 at the same time more organic fertilizers were also applied the used organic and chemical fertilizers increased from 4500 kg ha and 80 kg ha during 1960 1970 to 15 000 kg ha and 300 kg ha during 1980 1990 respectively there was no irrigation water supplied to the corn and wheat fields as there were rarely irrigation facilities operating during 1960 1970 1970 1980 and 1980 1990 from the late 1980 s onwards water storage and diversion facilities were increasingly built and put into use hence with considerable increase of irrigation water supply furrow irrigation has been carried out for the two croplands during 1990 2000 and 2000 2010 conventional tillage persisted for the three croplands until 2000 since then no tillage has replaced the conventional tillage for the corn and wheat fields with the implementation of water and soil conservation policies we parameterized changes of these management strategies furthermore we designed one scenario for each of the 5 decades namely sy 1 for 1960 1970 sy 2 for 1970 1980 sy 3 for 1980 1990 sy 4 for 1990 2000 and sy 5 for 2000 2010 based on the historical changes of the agricultural management strategies recorded in the local agricultural documents and literatures the details of the 5 scenarios are given in table 3 distributions of different types of soil and topography were considered unchanged in the watershed during the past five decades parameterized information on soil types and topography derived from the dem and soil map were applied to each of the 5 decades or scenarios fig 2a and b data on changes in areas and distributions of the corn field paddy field and wheat field in the shaying watershed were obtained by interpreting remote sense images of 1973 1987 1995 and 2005 with envi software fig 2c f according to local seniors and officials working in the relevant management agencies visited the areas and distributions of the three croplands changed little within each of the decades or even two decades lucc data collected from different literatures though sparse still somehow support such claims for example the data recorded in the annals and agricultural plans of guanling county suggest that the area of the three cultivated lands decreased only by 2 from 15 333 ha in 1982 to 15 075 ha in 1993 in the whole county thus the interpretation of 1973 1987 1995 and 2005 image have actually reflected the areas and distributions of the three croplands during 1970 1980 1980 1990 1990 2000 and 2000 2010 respectively no remote sensing images are available for the years before 1973 however areas and distributions of the three croplands didn t change significantly in the whole county during 1960 1980 as indicated by the annals of guanling county therefore the interpretation of 1973 s image may have also largely expressed the land use during 1960 1970 3 4 reservoir sediment analysis there were no observed sediment yield data that could be used to compare with or to check simulated sediment yields therefore we compared simulated soil loss with an erosion record based on analyses of sediments retrieved from the shibanqiao reservoir in the shaying watershed fig 1c to see if and how the two approach would indicate a same changing trend of soil erosion such a comparison may also give more implications on soil erosion in the study area two cores sbqsed 1 and sbq sed 2 24 and 23 cm long respectively were collected from the reservoir fig 1c in march 2003 and analyses of cesium 137 137cs activities total organic carbon toc tn total nitrogen particle size and mineral magnetism were performed wang et al 2008a 4 results 4 1 model calibration and validation the output from the calibration and validation and results of the field experiments for checking the two are listed in tables 4 and 5 the grain yields gy of the three crops simulated for the calibration were in good accordance with the results of the 27 field experiments the rrmse on the calibration for corn rice and wheat gy was 0 90 0 95 and 0 88 respectively table 5 indicating a good higher than 0 8 calibration as for ns the value on the calibration for the gy of corn rice and wheat was 0 97 0 61 and 0 69 respectively table 5 also implying a satisfactory higher than 0 5 calibration moriasi et al 2007 therefore both rrmese and ns suggest that the model calibration was acceptable for the gy of the three crops furthermore the gy simulated with the calibrated model for the validation were very close to the results of the other 13 field experiments table 5 the rrmse on the validation for the gy of the corn rice and wheat was respectively 0 93 0 94 and 0 96 higher than 0 9 while the ns value for the rice was 0 48 only slightly lower than 0 5 the relatively low value could be due to the narrow range 8 63 10 37 of the observed values for the rice field experiments used in the model validation nevertheless the ns value on the validation for the corn and wheat gy was 0 75 and 0 87 table 5 respectively the values of the gy simulated for calibration and validation were compared with the observed values from the field experiments fig 3 all the simulated values were highly correlated and similar to their corresponding observed values with r2 larger than 0 76 p 0 1 therefore the performance of the calibrated model was generally satisfactory in simulating gy of corn rice and wheat furthermore since crop growth were simulated satisfactorily for the shaying watershed the c factor in rusle closely related to plant cover could also be calculated reasonably thus the calibrated apex model may be also capable of simulating sediment yields effectively in the same watershed by recalculating the daily c factor 4 2 simulated grain yields for the past 50 years the simulated gy of the three crops in the shaying watershed are displayed in fig 4 a c the analysis of variance anova and multiple comparison analysis by the fisher s least significant difference lsd indicate that there were significant differences between the gy simulated for different scenarios in most cases table 6 however the differences were not significant between the gy of the corn rice and wheat for sy 1 and sy 2 neither were the ones between the gy of the rice and wheat for sy 4 and sy 5 table 6 the average corn gy for each decade was 0 83 1 51 3 64 6 33 and 8 59 t ha respectively fig 4a so as also implied by the anova and lsd analysis table 6 the gy of the corn increased persistently since 1980 and was the highest during 2000 2010 the average gy of rice simulated under the 5 scenarios was 2 36 2 20 5 09 7 35 and 7 79 t ha for the 5 decades respectively fig 4b similar to the case of the gy of the corn the rice gy also began to increase remarkably since 1980 the rice sy was significantly higher during 1990 2000 and 2000 2010 than during any one of the previous decades table 6 however the difference between the gy for the latest two decades was insignificant table 6 the 10 year s average wheat gy simulated with the sy 1 sy 2 sy 3 sy 4 and sy 5 was 1 70 2 08 4 88 5 93 and 6 50 t ha respectively fig 4c once again the significant increase of the wheat gy also started since 1980 and the average gy for 1990 2000 and 2000 2010 were significantly higher table 6 nevertheless there were no significant differences between the wheat gy for the two decades table 6 therefore the apex modeling suggests that the gy of the three crops have increased in general over the past 50 years implying a positive impact of the land management on the gy the simulated crop yields in the 11 subareas over the past 50 years are presented in fig 5 in different subareas variations in the simulated gy of corn rice and wheat displayed similar temporal trends within each of the decades and over the 50 years fig 5 so the gy of the three crops were all closely related to changes in agriculture management strategies in each of the subareas subarea 8 9 and 10 are mostly covered by calcareous soil while the other subareas are underlain with yellow earth fig 2b the gy of the corn was higher in the subareas underlain by the yellow earth than those by the calcareous soil for each year fig 5 though the differences were insignificant for the rice the gy was significantly higher in the yellow earth s subareas than in the calcareous soil s ones during 1990 2010 p 0 05 during all the five decades p 0 1 and particularly 1990 2010 p 0 05 the wheat gy was always significantly higher in the subareas covered by the yellow earth than in the ones by the calcareous soil fig 5 studies have suggested that fertilizer efficiency and biological accumulation are higher in the yellow earth than in calcareous soil on the guizhou plateau liao and long 1997 liu 2009 we thus temporally ascribed the higher gy of the crops planted on the yellow earth to the relatively high total nitrogen content and organic matter content of this type of soil 4 3 simulated sediment yields for the past 50 years the simulated sediment yields from the corn fields paddy fields and wheat fields in the shaying watershed are displayed in fig 4d f with both anova and multiple comparison analysis significance of the inter decade difference in the sediment yield was also checked for each of the three crop fields table 6 in the corn fields the average sediment yield was respectively 8 41 7 67 4 19 3 94 and 0 44 t ha for 1960 1970 1970 1980 1980 1990 1990 2000 and 2000 2010 fig 4d thus erosion begun to decline significantly since 1980 while the minimal erosion occurred during 2000 2010 as also indicated by the anova and multiple comparison analysis table 6 the simulated sediment yield was 9 49 10 54 6 82 6 14 and 6 65 t ha respectively in the rice fields for the five decades or sy 1 sy 2 sy 3 sy 4 and sy 5 fig 4e the average sediment yield for 1980 1990 1990 2000 and 2000 2010 was significantly different from and lower than the one for 1960 1970 and 1970 1980 table 6 and fig 4e so the soil erosion in the paddy fields started to decline since 1980 and was obviously weaker during the three later decades the average sediment yield in the wheat fields was 7 05 7 19 5 21 5 11 and 1 12 t ha for the 5 scenarios or decades fig 4f the difference between the sediment yields for sy 1 and sy 2 was not significant neither was the one between the sediment yield for sy 3 and sy 4 table 6 even so the sediment yield for sy 3 was significantly lower than the one for sy 2 table 6 and fig 4f furthermore the sediment yield in the wheat fields for sy 5 was still significantly different from and much lower than the one for each of the other four scenarios table 6 and fig 4f therefore soil erosion begun to decline remarkably in the wheat fields since 1980 and was the weakest during 2000 2010 on the whole soil erosion in both the corn fields and wheat fields was the minimal during 2000 2010 while the erosion has been persistently weak since 1980 in all the three croplands the values of the sediment yield in corn and wheat fields are comparatively lower and closer to the natural or geological erosion rates nearing et al 2017 one of the possible reasons is that the crop growth has increased the vegetation coverage and thus reduced soil erosion in the two crop fields for example the greatly promoted growth of the corn as implied by its highest gy may have largely increased the vegetation coverage and minimized the sediment yield in the corn field during 2000 2010 fig 4a and d spatial distributions of the sediment yields simulated are presented for each of the decades fig 6 for the convenience of describing the spatial patterns the erosion was classified into 5 categories based on the sediment yield simulated very slight erosion 0 4 t ha slight erosion 4 6 t ha moderate erosion 6 8 t ha strong erosion 8 10 t ha and very strong erosion 10 t ha soil erosion was the most intensive during 1960 1970 fig 6a the area of the cropland where the strong erosion and very strong erosion occurred was 1540 71 and 549 78 ha accounting for 53 47 and 19 11 of the total cropland of the watershed during this decade table 7 meanwhile the area of the cropland at which the slight and very slight erosion took place was only 144 96 ha accounting for 5 04 of the total farmland table 7 soil erosion declined somewhat during 1970 1980 fig 6b during this decade the cropland area of the strong and very strong erosion and its percentage decreased to 1244 43 and 259 35 ha and 48 27 and 10 06 respectively table 7 the summed area of the croplands of the slight and very slight erosion and its percentage increased to 336 93 ha and 13 07 in this decade table 7 during 1980 1990 the area of the strong and very strong erosion further shrank fig 6c and table 7 at the same time the area of the moderate and slight erosion 2136 13 and 859 21 ha and its percentage 67 and 26 98 increased fig 6c and table 7 afterwards soil erosion continued to decline during the subsequent decade 1990 2000 fig 6d the area of the slight and very slight erosion was 549 78 and 1540 71 ha accounting for 19 11 and 53 57 of the total area of the cropland table 7 during 2000 2010 soil erosion was the weakest fig 6e the area of the slight and very slight erosion increased to 259 52 and 1921 78 ha accounting for 10 07 and 74 54 of the total cropland during the most recent decade table 7 the spatial patterns of soil loss were generally similar during the five decades fig 6 erosion was often relatively intense in the southeast part of the watershed e g subarea 11 while erosion was usually rather slight in the central south e g subarea 8 and 9 5 discussion 5 1 impacts of management strategies on grain yield and soil erosion 5 1 1 increase of amount of fertilizers applied as expected the gy simulated by the model increased with the increase of the amount of fertilizers applied in the croplands during 1960 1970 and 1970 1980 the amount of fertilizers used in the fields of corn rice and wheat was small compilation committee of guanling county annals 2002 therefore the gy of the three crops were low fig 4a c in fact during the first two decades soil nutrients of the croplands were provided mainly by farmyard manure in guanling county the amount of chemical fertilizers applied was generally small until the late 1970 s in the farmlands in this county the chemical fertilizers used were only 1400 t each year during the 1960 s and early and mid 1970 s since the late 1970 s the amount of the chemical fertilizers used began to increase persistently and reached 6000 t in 2004 in addition biogas digestate also began to be used as manures since 1987 compilation group of basic facts on guanling buyi and miao autonomous county 2008 till 2002 totally 3250 pits were put into use to produce methane the by product biogas digestate was largely applied as manure in the farmlands crop potential growth can be facilitated when the crop is supplied with enough nutrients carey et al 2012 increased nitrogen input level can significantly increase grain yields biomass and harvest index agegnehu et al 2016 srivastava et al 2018 therefore the gy of the three crops began to increase from 1980 onwards with the increase of the applied amount of chemical fertilizers and organic fertilizers and were generally high since then fig 4a c the corn gy of 2000 2010 were raised by 7 62 times as against 1960 1970 in the shaying watershed fig 4a and the rice and wheat gy increased more than 3 times fig 4b and c the average sediment yields of 1980 1990 1990 2000 and 2000 2010 decreased by 33 34 and 70 compared to 1960 1970 respectively fig 4d f previous studies have suggested that appropriate increases of amounts of fertilizers applied may somehow alter physical and chemical properties of soils and thus reduce erosion geisseler and scow 2014 nest et al 2014 in addition increases of rate of fertilizer application may also raise nutrient s availability and water use efficiency in soils and thus promote crop growth gaiser et al 2004 increasing vegetation coverage and reducing erosion therefore the declining of soil erosion starting at 1980 could be also attributed to the raised input of the fertilizers 5 1 2 developments of irrigation systems the average gy of the corn rice and wheat further increased since 1990 and was thus significantly higher during 1990 2000 and 2000 2010 than during 1980 1990 fig 4a c and table 6 there were no irrigation systems at all and the crop fields were fed completely by rain in the watershed during 1960 1970 1970 1980 and 1980 1990 from the late 1980 s onwards irrigation systems began to be built compilation committee of guanling county annals 2002 compilation committee of guizhou province annals 2011 till 1998 up to 135 water storage and 652 water diversion projects were completed and put into use these facilities supplied irrigation water of about 9764 m3 to the corn and wheat fields each year during 1990 2000 and 2000 2010 crop yields are usually influenced by water availability most crops are particularly sensitive to water stress in the key stages when major yield components are determined doorenbos and kassam 1979 the main growth months are june july and august or summer months for most crops on the guizhou plateau the average of annual precipitation was 1298 5 1361 5 1280 1 1268 1 and 1184 mm for 1960 1970 1970 1980 1980 1990 1990 2000 and 2000 2010 respectively the average of summer precipitation was respectively 714 1 692 4 691 5 711 and 662 6 mm for the five decades there were no significant inter decade differences between the average of annual precipitation neither were there ones between those of summer precipitation p 0 1 thus the further increase of the gy happening since 1990 could be at least partly ascribed to the great quantity of water supplied by the irrigation systems the increases of available water resulting from wide operation of irrigation systems may have increased surface runoff in the farmlands during 1990 2000 however the sediment yield from the corn fields and wheat fields didn t increase at all fig 4d and f instead though not significantly the sediment yield from the two croplands even decreased by 6 and 2 respectively during 1990 2000 compared to 1980 1990 fig 4d and f and table 6 that was probably because the increased water promoted growth of the crops and hence increased vegetation coverage and decreased erosion 5 1 3 implementation of no tillage since 2002 no tillage and reduced tillage has been gradually implemented in the whole county huang et al 2011 the gy of corn increased by 36 during 2000 2010 compared to 1990 2000 fig 4a the gy of the rice and wheat only slightly increased during 2000 2010 and was not significantly from the one during 1990 2000 fig 4b and c and table 6 the amounts of fertilizers applied for each year were generally the same during 1990 2000 and 2000 2010 during the two decades the operation of irrigation systems was almost equally common in the county compilation committee of guanling county annals 2002 compilation committee of guizhou province annals 2011 thus the higher gy particularly those of the corn were predominately due to the implementation of the no tillage measure during 2000 2010 no tillage has been often considered as a management measure to sustain soil productivity the benefits of no tillage have been also reported in other studies mitchell et al 2017 found that adoption of no tillage may benefit soil health by improving chemical physical and biological characteristics of soil functions denardin et al 2019 demonstrated that the no tillage has led to higher organic matter of soils than conventional tillage and thus increased crop yield the no tillage combined with effective herbicide can increase grain yields from 10 to 30 percentage based on the field experiments in guizhou province wu et al 1991 therefore the no tillage could result in better soil nutrient conditions which increased gy of the three crops in the shaying watershed the implementation of the no tillage also decreased the sediment yield remarkably since 2000 compared to 1990 2000 the simulated sediment yield decreased by 92 from the corn fields and 81 from the wheat fields respectively during 2000 2010 fig 4d and f mhazo et al 2016 checked data on sediment yield for 282 paired no tilled and conventionally tilled runoff plots worldwide and concluded tillage abandonment have decreased sediment yield by 60 richardson and king 1995 also found that no tillage practice may enhance the soil retention capability of plowing layer under no tillage conditions many crop residues could be left on the surface of farmlands and thus have somehow protected soil from being eroded therefore the dramatic declining of erosion in the corn and wheat fields has been largely caused by the implementation of the no tillage during 2000 2010 5 2 comparing the simulated sediment yields with an erosion record of reservoir sediments the 137cs activities provided a chronological framework for the two sediment cores sbqsed 1 and sbq 2 from the shibanqiao reservoir fig 7 particle size of sediments of lakes reservoirs has been usually used as an indictor of intensity of soil erosion i e coarser particles imply intensified soil erosion and finer ones hint at declined erosion dearing 1997 schmidt et al 2002 chen et al 2004 variations in particle size of the cores appear to have straightforwardly reflected changes of the soil erosion in the catchment of the reservoir during 1960 2002 wang et al 2008a hence the mean particle size of the two cores have been compared with the sediment yields simulated fig 7 particularly as shown by the comparison between the summed sediment yields fig 7d and mean particle size of the reservoir sediments fig 7e and f the two methods have actually indicated very similar variations in soil erosion within each of the earlier three decades 1960 1970 1970 1980 and 1980 1990 the higher annual sediment yield simulated was often corresponding to the coarser particles of the two cores while the lower annual sediment yield to the finer ones during 1960 1990 fig 7e and f the simulated sediment yields began to decrease from 1980 onwards fig 7d particles of the reservoir sediments have simultaneously become finer as shown by the mean particle size data and particularly those of sbqsed 2 fig 7f the reservoir sediment record theoretically reflected the total erosion in the whole sub basin while the sediment yield simulated by apex was only a manifestation of the erosion in the corn rice and wheat fields thus the agreement suggests that the changes in the total erosion in the sub basin were largely controlled by those in the erosion in the three crop fields during 1960 1970 1970 1980 and 1980 1990 such consistency between the variations in the mean particle size of the reservoir sediments and simulated sediment yield also somehow prove that apex was reliable for simulating erosion for the three decades variations in the mean particle size indicate that the erosion considerably intensified in the entire sub basin during 1990 2000 fig 7d f however the sediment yield simulated for 1990 2000 decreased implying declining erosion fig 7a d a massive afforestation was initiated in 1993 and forestlands of 22 130 mu 1460 ha thus increased since then in the whole county compilation committee of guanling county annals 2002 compilation committee of guizhou province annals 2011 nevertheless the newly planted young trees were incapable of protecting soils from being eroded at the beginning the soils were considerably loosened and more vulnerable to erosion in the reclaimed land mainly grasslands and barren lands where the trees were being planted other studies have also suggested that land reclamation may result in severe soil erosion at its earlier stage porto et al 2009 jia et al 2017 therefore the gross erosion didn t decline and instead intensified during the initial stage of the massive afforestation in the whole sub basin though the erosion occurring in the three croplands declined 6 conclusions calibration and validation indicate that the apex model can reasonably simulate gy of corn rice and wheat commonly planted in the shaying watershed a small catchment underlain largely by carbonate rocks on the sw guizhou plateau changes in agricultural managements have to different extent influenced the gy and soil erosion for different crops in this watershed the increase of the amount of the chemical fertilizers beginning around 1980 significantly increased the gy of the corn rice and wheat and decreased the sediment yields in the three crop fields the increase of the quantity of the irrigation water starting around 1990 further raised gy of the three crops and slightly reduced the sediment yields from the croplands the no tillage implemented during 2000 2010 significantly increased the gy of the corn and decreased the sediment yield in the corn fields and wheat fields during this decade the impacts of the no tillage implementation were insignificant on the gy of the rice and wheat and sediment yields in the paddy fields particle size of the sediments sampled from a reservoir and simulated sediment yield suggest very similar changes in soil erosion within each of the earlier three decades 1960 1970 1970 1980 and 1980 1990 thus the changes in the erosion in the whole reservoir s catchment were probably mainly controlled by those in the erosion taking placing in the fields of the three crops during the three decades such coincidence of the apex modeling with sediment analysis may also imply the reliability of the sediment yield simulation the reservoir sediment record and apex modeling indicate different changes in erosion during 1990 2000 which could be attributed to intensification of the erosion in the uncultivated land caused by human activities all the results aforementioned have revealed how the changes in agricultural management strategies could have influenced both grain yields and sediment yields in the shaying watershed furthermore these results have also implied that the apex model is applicable in evaluating impacts of varying management strategies on crop productivity and soil erosion in this and other similar watersheds on the guizhou plateau
