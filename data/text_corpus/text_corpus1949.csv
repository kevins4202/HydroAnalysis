9745,cyanobacterial blooms and microcystins mcs in irrigation waters have been recognized as an emergent environmental threat to many terrestrial plants while several studies addressed the impacts of crude cyanobacterial extracts and dissolved mc containing water on crop plants less is known about the effects of irrigation water containing cyanobacterial blooms i e intracellular plus extracellular toxins in the present study we investigated the effects of whole culture cell free culture filtrate and living cells of the toxic cyanobacterium chroococcus minutus on growth physiological parameters and mc accumulation in phaseolus vulgaris bush bean plants the plants were grown in pots containing agricultural soil in order to mimic common agricultural practice after 4 weeks of growth treated plants exhibited substantial reduction in root and shoot growth photosynthetic pigments and protein contents compared to control plants treated plants also showed higher lipid peroxidation than control plants the lowest inhibitory effects were observed in plants treated with culture filtrate containing extracellular mcs only 15 3 μg l 1 the highest inhibitory effects were recorded in plants treated with whole cyanobacterial culture containing both intra and extracellular mcs 132 μg l 1 indicating the release of intracellular mcs from cells into the rizhosphere and their uptake by plant roots mc concentrations in immature pods of p vulgaris plants irrigated with whole culture and living cyanobacterial cells led to estimates of daily mcs intake 0 125 0 391 μg kg 1 body weight that exceeded the total daily intake guidelines 0 04 μg kg 1 body weight for human food consumption this study suggests that irrigation water as well as plants used in human consumption should be regularly monitored for the presence of mcs and other cyanotoxins keywords accumulation cyanobacteria irrigation water microcystins vegetable plants 1 introduction cyanobacterial blooms cb are a worldwide phenomenon in eutrophic water bodies romero oliva et al 2014 these blooms represent a threat to human and environmental health because some species produce toxic metabolites called cyanotoxins dittmann and wiegand 2006 among the cyanotoxins microcystins mcs are the most widespread group in natural water with more than 270 variants identified so far bouaïcha et al 2019 mcs are normally retained inside cyanobacterial cells and are released to the surrounding water only after cell lysis at the end of bloom events or algicide application tsuji et al 2001 therefore mcs would be found with high concentrations in natural water and thereby cause adverse effects on crop and vegetable plants when contaminating water is used in irrigation romero oliva et al 2014 machado et al 2017 previous studies revealed that mcs enter plants via the root system and are then transported further to the stem leaves fruits and seeds corbel et al 2014 and the references cited therein studies have also showed that mcs can exert adverse effects on plants including the inhibition of seed germination and plant growth impairment of photosynthesis tissue necrosis oxidative stress and loss of membrane integrity mohamed and al shehri 2010 campos et al 2021 besides their effects on plant growth and physiological processes mcs may also accumulate in plant tissues and thereby pose a possible risk to food safety and human health upon consumption of contaminated edible plant parts mohamed and al shehri 2009 cordeiro araújo et al 2016 nevertheless not all plant exposure situations to mcs may lead to plant growth inhibition and toxicity it was found that the adverse effects of mcs on plants depend on several factors including toxin concentration in the irrigation water the length of the exposure period plant species growth conditions and growth stage levizou et al 2017 campos et al 2021 the common bean phaseolus vulgaris is one of the most important leguminous vegetable crops in the world gepts et al 2008 the immature pods of this bean are usually used as food source in most tropical and subtropical countries graham and vance 2003 therefore using cyanobacteria contaminated water for irrigation could affect the growth of this crop furthermore bean plants might accumulate mcs in their edible pods and thereby pose a risk to human health upon consumption of contaminated legumes c minutus is one of the most dominant cyanobacteria found year round in egyptian irrigation waters mohamed 2016 our hypothesis is that this cyanobacterium may produce mcs and hence its presence in irrigation water could represent a risk to crop and vegetable plants therefore we evaluated the toxin production in this species and its potential negative effects on bush been plants most studies of mc phytotoxicity on p vulgaris were carried out by exposing plants to crude mc extracts malaissi et al 2020 sedan et al 2020 instead it should be interesting if plants are treated with water containing intact cyanobacterial cells the condition that is closer to the real situation when contaminated water is used for irrigation therefore the aim of this work was to compare the toxic effects of the whole culture suspension cell free culture filtrate and living cells of the cyanobacterium c minutus on p vulgaris growth and some physiological parameters the study also investigates the possible accumulation of mcs in edible immature pods of this plant and evaluates the potential risk of mc levels accumulated in these parts to human health 2 materials and methods 2 1 isolation and culturing of chroococcus minutus the cyanobacterium c minutus used in our experiments was isolated from fish pond in sohag district egypt the organism was grown in 250 ml conical flask containing bg 11 medium at 30 ºc and illumination of 50μmol m 2 s 1 with 16 8 light dark period the cells were harvested at exponential stage cell density 2 1 107 cells l 1 and centrifuged at 6000 x g for 15 min the cell free supernatant was used for determination of extracellular mcs after concentration through c 18 cartridge the pellet was used for determination of intracellular mcs by its extraction in methanol 80 over night at room temperature 25 2 c the extract was then centrifuged at 6000 x g for 15 min and the pellet was re extracted again by the same method mentioned above the supernatants were pooled together and the organic solvent was evaporated under sterile air the toxins in the remaining aqueous fraction were cleaned up by passing through c 18 cartridge the toxins were then eluted with 80 methanol evaporated to dryness and reconstituted in 1 ml methanol the toxins were estimated by agilant 1200 high performance liquid chromatography hplc with uv photodiode array detector set at 238 nm chromatographic separation was performed on a zorbax eclips c18 150 mm 4 6 mm 5 µm column usa following the conditions described previously by mohamed et al 2015 extracellular mcs present in cell free medium of c minutus cultures were also detected by hplc by the same method mentioned above mc lr was used as a standard during the present study abraxis warminster pa the detection limit of the device is 0 5 µg l 1 and the quantification limit is 0 3 µg l 1 2 2 plant exposure to cyanobacterial materials p vulgaris seeds were surface sterilized with 0 1 sodium hypochlorite solution for 3 min washed in sterile distilled water for 10 min and germinated in in pots 30 cm in diameter containing sterilized sand clay 2 1 soil after 2 weeks of germination the seedlings were exposed to whole c minutus culture 2 1 105 cells ml 1 cell free culture filtrate or living cells suspended in dechlorinated tap water 2 1 105 cells ml 1 control pots did not contain any cyanobacterial materials both control and treated pots were kept in greenhouse with irradiance 300 µmol m 2 s 1 photosynthetically active radiation 400 700 nm at 28 2 c 10 relative humidity during day time and 18 2 c and 30 relative humidity at night the pots were weighed daily to determine the evapotranspirated water and the evapotranspiration volume was then replenished with dechlorinated tap water plants were also watered with cyanobacterial materials whole culture culture filtrate living cells every 15 days while control plants were irrigated with dechlorinated tap water the total volume of mc containing water applied to plants during the study period was three liters at the time of treatment the amount of mcs was determined in the whole culture 132 μg l 1 cell free culture filtrate 15 3 μg l 1 and living cells 116 7 μg l 1 shoot roots and fruits immature pods were collected from each plant after 6 weeks of exposure i e after 8 weeks of growth roots and shoots fresh and dry weights were determined and the specimens were stored at 80 c for subsequent analysis either control or treated groups consisted of 3 pots n 3 and each pot contained five plants 2 3 photosynthetic pigment determination concentrations of chlorophyll a chlorophyll b and carotenoids were determined spectrophoto metrically according to the method of lichtenthaler 1987 the pigments were extracted in 85 aqueous acetone from a well known fresh weight of the leaf sample absorbance was recorded at three wave lengths of 453 644 and 663 nm pigment fraction concentrations were calculated using the following equations chlorophyll a µg ml 10 3 e663 0 918 e644 chlorophyll b µg ml 19 7 e644 3 87 e663 carotenoids µg ml 4 2 e453 0 0264 chlorophyll a 0 0462 chlorophyll b ultimately pigment concentrations were calculated as µg g fresh weight 2 4 malondialdehyde and protein content to assess the ability of mcs to induce lipid peroxidation in p vulgaris plants the malondialdehyde mda content in leaves was measured according to the method of heath and packer 1968 mda concentration was calculated using its extinction coefficient 155 mm 1 cm 1 heath and packer 1968 and expressed as nm per gram fresh weight total soluble proteins in leaves were determined using folin phenol reagent following lowry et al 1951 method 2 5 determination of microcystin accumulated in plant tissues roots shoots and immature pods 3 g were washed thrice with distilled water thinly sliced horizontally and homogenized separately with 20 ml methanol 80 in a mortar each homogenate was wrapped in aluminum foil and left overnight at room temperature the extract of each plant part was centrifuged at 6000x g for 15 min and the pellet was re extracted again in 80 methanol the supernatants were pooled together and evaporated with sterile air under dryness the dried extracts were dissolved in methanol 100 and filtered through a 0 2 µm nylon syringe filter mc concentrations in the filtered extracts were then determined by hplc under the same conditions described above in the present study the detection of mcs in plant tissues was limited only to the free mcs i e non covalently bound mcs since this fraction is readily available and bioactive and thereby is used for monitoring and for food safety assessment suchy and berry 2012 gutiérrez praena et al 2014 2 6 calculation of estimated daily intake the estimated daily intake edi of mcs for an average sized adult 60 kg and child 25 kg was calculated based on our data i e mc concentrations detected in p vulgaris fruits and the daily vegetable consumption using the following equation according to cordeiro araújo et al 2016 we assumed that adults consume 300 g of p vulgaris daily while children consume 100 g only 1 edi µg kg bw d mc dc bw where c is mc concentration ng g 1 fw detected in p vulgaris pods dc is the daily vegetable consumption and bw is the average body weight adults 60 kg and children 25 kg 2 7 statistical analysis differences in growth and physiological parameters and accumulating mcs between control and treated groups of p vulgaris plants were determined by one way anova results were considered significant at p 0 05 tukey s least significance difference lsd test was used for multiple pairwise comparisons 3 results and discussion 3 1 microcystins in cyanobacterial cells the results of the hplc chromatograms revealed that the methanolic extract of the cyanobacterium c minutus contained mainly mc lr with minor unknown mcs when compared to mc lr standard fig 1 the total toxin concentration in the whole culture of c minutus was 132 μg l 1 while it was 116 7 μg l 1 within living cells i e intracellular mcs and 15 3 μg l 1 in cell free culture filtrate i e extracellular mcs taken the results of previous studies on toxin production in cyanobacteria to our knowledge the present study provides an evidence of mc production for the first time in c minutus therefore molecular identification of this strain is necessary and would be addressed in the near future notably mc lr is the most toxic and commonly found cyanotoxin variant in freshwater sources worldwide aba et al 2021 it is also a specific inhibitor of protein phosphate enzymes 1 and 2 a that regulate multiple cellular functions in higher plants mackintosh et al 1990 therefore its negative effects on crop and vegetable plants are an issue of global concern 3 2 effects of cyanobacterial materials on plant growth and physiological parameters the results of plant cyanobacteria co cultivation experiments showed that p vulgaris plants exposed to different cyanobacterial materials of c minutus i e whole culture cell free culture filtrate living cells exhibited a significant decrease p 0 05 in shoot and root weight and total leaf area compared to control figs 2 3 these growth parameters also varied significantly among different treatments p 0 05 with highest reduction obtained in plants treated with whole c minutus culture while the lowest was recorded in plants treated with cell free culture filtrate these results are in accordance with previous studies reporting that exposure of crop plants such as bean maize wheat rye grass clover rape and lettuce to mcs caused a decrease in the fresh and dry weight of their roots and shoots saqrane et al 2008 saqrane and oudra 2009 lahrouni et al 2012 2013 chen et al 2012 el khalloufi et al 2012 our study is also in line with other studies reporting a reduction in leaf area of tomato and cucumber plants exposed to mc containing water al sultan and hatem 2018 zhu et al 2018 concomitant with plant growth inhibition physiological and biochemical parameters including photosynthetic pigments and protein content of plant leaves also decreased markedly in plants treated with toxic materials of c minutus p 0 05 compared to control figs 4 5 in agreement with these results other authors reported a decrease in chlorophyll content in vicia faba lahrouni et al 2013 p vulgaris al sultan and hatem 2018 and solanum lycopersicum sedan et al 2020 when irrigated with mc contaminated water the decrease in chlorophyll content could be one of the factors that affect photosynthetic rate in plants liang et al 2016 the decrease in total protein content of p vulgaris plants exposed to mcs during our study could be due to the inhibition of protein synthesis by mcs as suggested for lettuce plants by bittencourt oliveira et al 2016 in our experiments mda content in p vulgaris plants treated with toxic materials of c minutus was higher than in control plants fig 6 indicating that mcs in c minutus materials promoted oxidative stress in plants mc toxicity was previously related to oxidative promotion and cellular damage i e lipid peroxidation in several agricultural plants e g pisum sativum p vulgaris medicago sativa oryza sativa triticum aestivum and zea mays pflugmacher et al 2006 peuthert et al 2007 chen et al 2012 campos et al 2021 generally oxidative stressors such as mcs induce overproduction of reactive oxygen species ros which always attack cell membrane lipid and lead to lipid peroxidation el khalloufi et al 2012 azevedo et al 2014 however it seems that the major factor governing the phytotoxicity of mcs is the toxin concentration to which plants are exposed most previous studies have revealed that extracellular mcs at concentrations of 10 100 μg l 1 in irrigation water did not cause plant growth inhibition or significant disturbance of physiological parameters particularly when plants are grown in a soil system azevedo et al 2014 corbel et al 2015 bittencourt oliveira et al 2016 gutiérrez praena et al 2014 redouane et al 2021 however intracellular mcs are primary fractions of mcs representing 98 6 of total mcs in eutrophic waters xiang et al 2019 considering intracellular toxin fraction total mcs extra and intracellular mcs in irrigation waters could reach up to 400 514 µg l 1 during bloom events kotak and zurawell 2007 xiang et al 2019 and this increases the adverse effects of exposure to these toxins in crop plants in our study mc concentrations contained in c minutus materials 15 3 132 μg l 1 caused reduction in growth and physiological parameters of p vulgaris plants interestingly the exposure of p vulgaris plants to living c minutus cells i e intracellular toxins only showed greater reduction in plant growth and physiological parameters than cell free culture filtrate i e extracellular toxins this reflects the continuous release of mcs from c minutus cells after cellular breakdown under environmental conditions and hence their accumulation in the rhizosphere may have contributed to a continuous exposure and uptake of mcs by plant roots our results therefore support the suggestion that high fractions of intracellular mcs in cyanobacterial cells undergo the long term preservation and successive release from cells once they entered soil from irrigation water li et al 2014 zastepa et al 2015 campos et al 2021 however mc concentrations adsorbed onto soil should be determined in further studies to know toxin quantity absorbed and translocated by plants 3 3 accumulation of mcs in plant tissues after 6 weeks of irrigation with mc contaminated water mc was detected in roots shoots and green pods of p vulgaris plant at different levels table 1 mc concentrations accumulated in these plant parts differed significantly among treatment materials of c minutus p 0 05 depending on mc concentrations contained in these materials the highest amount of mc accumulated in roots shoots and immature pods 8 6 12 2 78 2 ng g 1 fw respectively were recorded in p vulgaris plants treated with whole c minutus culture which contained the highest mc concentration 132 μg l 1 table 1 whereas the lowest accumulating mc in roots shoots and immature pods 1 7 2 2 4 3 ng g 1 fw respectively were detected in plants treated with cell free culture filtrate containing the lowest mc quantity 15 3 μg l 1 our results are thus in harmony with other studies showing that the levels of accumulating mcs in plants e g t durum z mays p sativum and l esculenta and o sativa were positively correlated with mc concentrations to which plants were exposed saqrane and oudra 2009 bittencourt oliveira et al 2016 liang et al 2016 machado et al 2017 additionally accumulating mcs varied significantly p 0 05 among roots shoots and pods for each treatment material in our study generally the accumulation order of mcs in plant parts was roots shoots immature pods table 1 the presence of mcs in immature pods indicates that mc was taken by the plant and distributed to various organs in this respect it has been suggested that mc is absorbed by plants via the root system and then translocated to the shoots and even fruits peuthert et al 2007 crush et al 2008 saqrane and oudra 2009 romero oliva et al 2014 liang et al 2016 although specific transporters of mc in plants have not been described yet this toxin being a peptide could be absorbed and transported by plant membrane transporters with affinities for different peptides and amino acids tegeder and rentsch 2010 machado et al 2017 of particular concern in our study is the accumulation of mc in p vulgaris fruits immature pods at highest level of 78 2 ng g 1 fw these concentrations are higher than mc concentrations accumulated in green beans 24 ng g 1 fw irrigated with lake xingyun water china xiang et al 2019 this discrepancy could be due to higher concentrations of mcs in irrigation water used in our study 132 μg l 1 than concentrations 16 2 µg total mcs l 1 used by xiang et al 2019 previous studies also demonstrated the accumulation of considerable amounts of mcs in fruits of other plants upon irrigation with mc contaminated water romero oliva et al 2014 detected 1 16 ng mcs g 1 dw in tomato fruits irrigated with water containing 2 021 mg mcs l 1 drobac et al 2017 demonstrated that the exposure of capsicum annum plants to microcystis aeruginosa extract containing 245 μg mcs l 1 resulted in the accumulation of 195 ng mcs g 1 dw in their fruits zhu et al 2018 detected mcs in cucumber fruits at levels of 15 43 and 29 64 ng g 1 fw after cucumber plants were exposed to 100 and 1000 μg l 1 mcs for 7 days respectively great concern about the accumulation of mcs in green beans is the potential human risk from consumption of such contaminated food to assess the human health risk the estimated daily intake edi of mcs via consumption of green beans in egypt was calculated and compared with the tolerable daily intake tdi of 0 04 μg mc lr kg body weight bw day established and devised by the world health organization who 2017 taken into account that green bean could be consumed in most countries including egypt as fresh frozen or canned materials green bean is available as a food all year and could be consumed daily then if a 60 kg adult person consuming 300 g fw of green bean contaminated with mcs as reported in our study 78 2 31 2 4 3 ng mc g green beans fw table 1 the corresponding edi would be 0 391 0 156 and 0 023 μg mcs kg bw d respectively table 1 meanwhile if 25 kg children consume 100 g of such mc contaminated green beans edi values 0 313 0 125 0 02 mcs kg bw d are slightly lower than those estimated for adult table 1 this reflects that edi of green bean pods irrigated with intact cyanobacterial cells and whole culture containing higher mc contents surpassed the who limit by 4 and 10 times for adults and by 3 and 8 times for children whereas the edi of green bean irrigated with cyanobacterial culture filtrate was lower than that limit it is noteworthy that the approach followed in our study is similar to the natural conditions in irrigation water with prolonged cyanobacterial blooms and mimics the common agricultural practice with real cyanobacterial cell density and mc concentrations prevailing in egyptian water mohamed 2016 this indicates that green bean cultivated under these conditions worldwide could represent a risk to human health through food consumption 4 conclusions the results of present study clearly confirm that the exposure to toxic c minutus caused adverse effects on growth and physiological traits of p vulgaris plants the degree of these effects varied significantly between treatments of different cyanobacterial materials the highest phytotoxicity was obtained in plants treated with c minutus whole culture and the lowest was observed in plants treated with culture filtrate this accentuates the importance of intracellular mcs which could be continuously released from cyanobacterial cells once they entered soil from irrigation water and accumulate in the rizhosphere to be more available for uptake by plant roots moreover mcs were also detected in fruits of green bean suggesting that it was taken up by the plant and transported to different organs taking as reference the tolerable daily intake established by the who 0 04 μg kg body weight day the toxin concentrations recorded in immature pods of green bean exceeded this limit and could represent a health risk for both adults and children therefore a great attention should be paid towards the impact of irrigation water with toxic cyanobacteria on plants and mc levels should be regularly monitored in the irrigation waters particularly in the areas plagued with cyanobacteria blooms furthermore all plants used in human consumption need to be investigated periodically for the presence of mcs and other cyanotoxins before delivering into the market

fw detected in p vulgaris pods dc is the daily vegetable consumption and bw is the average body weight adults 60 kg and children 25 kg 2 7 statistical analysis differences in growth and physiological parameters and accumulating mcs between control and treated groups of p vulgaris plants were determined by one way anova results were considered significant at p 0 05 tukey s least significance difference lsd test was used for multiple pairwise comparisons 3 results and discussion 3 1 microcystins in cyanobacterial cells the results of the hplc chromatograms revealed that the methanolic extract of the cyanobacterium c minutus contained mainly mc lr with minor unknown mcs when compared to mc lr standard fig 1 the total toxin concentration in the whole culture of c minutus was 132 μg l 1 while it was 116 7 μg l 1 within living cells i e intracellular mcs and 15 3 μg l 1 in cell free culture filtrate i e extracellular mcs taken the results of previous studies on toxin production in cyanobacteria to our knowledge the present study provides an evidence of mc production for the first time in c minutus therefore molecular identification of this strain is necessary and would be addressed in the near future notably mc lr is the most toxic and commonly found cyanotoxin variant in freshwater sources worldwide aba et al 2021 it is also a specific inhibitor of protein phosphate enzymes 1 and 2 a that regulate multiple cellular functions in higher plants mackintosh et al 1990 therefore its negative effects on crop and vegetable plants are an issue of global concern 3 2 effects of cyanobacterial materials on plant growth and physiological parameters the results of plant cyanobacteria co cultivation experiments showed that p vulgaris plants exposed to different cyanobacterial materials of c minutus i e whole culture cell free culture filtrate living cells exhibited a significant decrease p 0 05 in shoot and root weight and total leaf area compared to control figs 2 3 these growth parameters also varied significantly among different treatments p 0 05 with highest reduction obtained in plants treated with whole c minutus culture while the lowest was recorded in plants treated with cell free culture filtrate these results are in accordance with previous studies reporting that exposure of crop plants such as bean maize wheat rye grass clover rape and lettuce to mcs caused a decrease in the fresh and dry weight of their roots and shoots saqrane et al 2008 saqrane and oudra 2009 lahrouni et al 2012 2013 chen et al 2012 el khalloufi et al 2012 our study is also in line with other studies reporting a reduction in leaf area of tomato and cucumber plants exposed to mc containing water al sultan and hatem 2018 zhu et al 2018 concomitant with plant growth inhibition physiological and biochemical parameters including photosynthetic pigments and protein content of plant leaves also decreased markedly in plants treated with toxic materials of c minutus p 0 05 compared to control figs 4 5 in agreement with these results other authors reported a decrease in chlorophyll content in vicia faba lahrouni et al 2013 p vulgaris al sultan and hatem 2018 and solanum lycopersicum sedan et al 2020 when irrigated with mc contaminated water the decrease in chlorophyll content could be one of the factors that affect photosynthetic rate in plants liang et al 2016 the decrease in total protein content of p vulgaris plants exposed to mcs during our study could be due to the inhibition of protein synthesis by mcs as suggested for lettuce plants by bittencourt oliveira et al 2016 in our experiments mda content in p vulgaris plants treated with toxic materials of c minutus was higher than in control plants fig 6 indicating that mcs in c minutus materials promoted oxidative stress in plants mc toxicity was previously related to oxidative promotion and cellular damage i e lipid peroxidation in several agricultural plants e g pisum sativum p vulgaris medicago sativa oryza sativa triticum aestivum and zea mays pflugmacher et al 2006 peuthert et al 2007 chen et al 2012 campos et al 2021 generally oxidative stressors such as mcs induce overproduction of reactive oxygen species ros which always attack cell membrane lipid and lead to lipid peroxidation el khalloufi et al 2012 azevedo et al 2014 however it seems that the major factor governing the phytotoxicity of mcs is the toxin concentration to which plants are exposed most previous studies have revealed that extracellular mcs at concentrations of 10 100 μg l 1 in irrigation water did not cause plant growth inhibition or significant disturbance of physiological parameters particularly when plants are grown in a soil system azevedo et al 2014 corbel et al 2015 bittencourt oliveira et al 2016 gutiérrez praena et al 2014 redouane et al 2021 however intracellular mcs are primary fractions of mcs representing 98 6 of total mcs in eutrophic waters xiang et al 2019 considering intracellular toxin fraction total mcs extra and intracellular mcs in irrigation waters could reach up to 400 514 µg l 1 during bloom events kotak and zurawell 2007 xiang et al 2019 and this increases the adverse effects of exposure to these toxins in crop plants in our study mc concentrations contained in c minutus materials 15 3 132 μg l 1 caused reduction in growth and physiological parameters of p vulgaris plants interestingly the exposure of p vulgaris plants to living c minutus cells i e intracellular toxins only showed greater reduction in plant growth and physiological parameters than cell free culture filtrate i e extracellular toxins this reflects the continuous release of mcs from c minutus cells after cellular breakdown under environmental conditions and hence their accumulation in the rhizosphere may have contributed to a continuous exposure and uptake of mcs by plant roots our results therefore support the suggestion that high fractions of intracellular mcs in cyanobacterial cells undergo the long term preservation and successive release from cells once they entered soil from irrigation water li et al 2014 zastepa et al 2015 campos et al 2021 however mc concentrations adsorbed onto soil should be determined in further studies to know toxin quantity absorbed and translocated by plants 3 3 accumulation of mcs in plant tissues after 6 weeks of irrigation with mc contaminated water mc was detected in roots shoots and green pods of p vulgaris plant at different levels table 1 mc concentrations accumulated in these plant parts differed significantly among treatment materials of c minutus p 0 05 depending on mc concentrations contained in these materials the highest amount of mc accumulated in roots shoots and immature pods 8 6 12 2 78 2 ng g 1 fw respectively were recorded in p vulgaris plants treated with whole c minutus culture which contained the highest mc concentration 132 μg l 1 table 1 whereas the lowest accumulating mc in roots shoots and immature pods 1 7 2 2 4 3 ng g 1 fw respectively were detected in plants treated with cell free culture filtrate containing the lowest mc quantity 15 3 μg l 1 our results are thus in harmony with other studies showing that the levels of accumulating mcs in plants e g t durum z mays p sativum and l esculenta and o sativa were positively correlated with mc concentrations to which plants were exposed saqrane and oudra 2009 bittencourt oliveira et al 2016 liang et al 2016 machado et al 2017 additionally accumulating mcs varied significantly p 0 05 among roots shoots and pods for each treatment material in our study generally the accumulation order of mcs in plant parts was roots shoots immature pods table 1 the presence of mcs in immature pods indicates that mc was taken by the plant and distributed to various organs in this respect it has been suggested that mc is absorbed by plants via the root system and then translocated to the shoots and even fruits peuthert et al 2007 crush et al 2008 saqrane and oudra 2009 romero oliva et al 2014 liang et al 2016 although specific transporters of mc in plants have not been described yet this toxin being a peptide could be absorbed and transported by plant membrane transporters with affinities for different peptides and amino acids tegeder and rentsch 2010 machado et al 2017 of particular concern in our study is the accumulation of mc in p vulgaris fruits immature pods at highest level of 78 2 ng g 1 fw these concentrations are higher than mc concentrations accumulated in green beans 24 ng g 1 fw irrigated with lake xingyun water china xiang et al 2019 this discrepancy could be due to higher concentrations of mcs in irrigation water used in our study 132 μg l 1 than concentrations 16 2 µg total mcs l 1 used by xiang et al 2019 previous studies also demonstrated the accumulation of considerable amounts of mcs in fruits of other plants upon irrigation with mc contaminated water romero oliva et al 2014 detected 1 16 ng mcs g 1 dw in tomato fruits irrigated with water containing 2 021 mg mcs l 1 drobac et al 2017 demonstrated that the exposure of capsicum annum plants to microcystis aeruginosa extract containing 245 μg mcs l 1 resulted in the accumulation of 195 ng mcs g 1 dw in their fruits zhu et al 2018 detected mcs in cucumber fruits at levels of 15 43 and 29 64 ng g 1 fw after cucumber plants were exposed to 100 and 1000 μg l 1 mcs for 7 days respectively great concern about the accumulation of mcs in green beans is the potential human risk from consumption of such contaminated food to assess the human health risk the estimated daily intake edi of mcs via consumption of green beans in egypt was calculated and compared with the tolerable daily intake tdi of 0 04 μg mc lr kg body weight bw day established and devised by the world health organization who 2017 taken into account that green bean could be consumed in most countries including egypt as fresh frozen or canned materials green bean is available as a food all year and could be consumed daily then if a 60 kg adult person consuming 300 g fw of green bean contaminated with mcs as reported in our study 78 2 31 2 4 3 ng mc g green beans fw table 1 the corresponding edi would be 0 391 0 156 and 0 023 μg mcs kg bw d respectively table 1 meanwhile if 25 kg children consume 100 g of such mc contaminated green beans edi values 0 313 0 125 0 02 mcs kg bw d are slightly lower than those estimated for adult table 1 this reflects that edi of green bean pods irrigated with intact cyanobacterial cells and whole culture containing higher mc contents surpassed the who limit by 4 and 10 times for adults and by 3 and 8 times for children whereas the edi of green bean irrigated with cyanobacterial culture filtrate was lower than that limit it is noteworthy that the approach followed in our study is similar to the natural conditions in irrigation water with prolonged cyanobacterial blooms and mimics the common agricultural practice with real cyanobacterial cell density and mc concentrations prevailing in egyptian water mohamed 2016 this indicates that green bean cultivated under these conditions worldwide could represent a risk to human health through food consumption 4 conclusions the results of present study clearly confirm that the exposure to toxic c minutus caused adverse effects on growth and physiological traits of p vulgaris plants the degree of these effects varied significantly between treatments of different cyanobacterial materials the highest phytotoxicity was obtained in plants treated with c minutus whole culture and the lowest was observed in plants treated with culture filtrate this accentuates the importance of intracellular mcs which could be continuously released from cyanobacterial cells once they entered soil from irrigation water and accumulate in the rizhosphere to be more available for uptake by plant roots moreover mcs were also detected in fruits of green bean suggesting that it was taken up by the plant and transported to different organs taking as reference the tolerable daily intake established by the who 0 04 μg kg body weight day the toxin concentrations recorded in immature pods of green bean exceeded this limit and could represent a health risk for both adults and children therefore a great attention should be paid towards the impact of irrigation water with toxic cyanobacteria on plants and mc levels should be regularly monitored in the irrigation waters particularly in the areas plagued with cyanobacteria blooms furthermore all plants used in human consumption need to be investigated periodically for the presence of mcs and other cyanotoxins before delivering into the market

9746,under the background of climate warming the global water cycle is gradually accelerating which will lead to increased drought frequency and severity china is one of the countries with the highest drought risk and the most serious drought impact accompanied by abnormal and variable drought characteristics in recent decades however the dynamic variation of meteorological drought and its complicated relationships with agricultural drought are still unclear across china in this study the characteristics of meteorological drought were comprehensively identified across china during 1960 2019 the spatio temporal variations and gridded trend characteristics of meteorological drought were revealed during the study period subsequently the return period of meteorological drought was quantitatively determined based on copula models finally the relationships between meteorological and agricultural drought were explicitly clarified the results indicated that 1 meteorological drought showed an increasing trend across china from 1960 to 2019 especially since the 1990s 2 the most serious meteorological drought occurred in 2011 with a minimum standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei value of 0 81 3 the percentage of drought area pda with an increasing trend in spring summer autumn and winter was 85 8 77 4 97 7 and 12 9 respectively 4 the most appropriate copula model of meteorological drought severity and duration was frank copula and 5 the propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought was longer in winter and shorter in summer which can determine the appropriate irrigation period and predict the occurrence of agricultural drought this study sheds new viewpoints into the identification of meteorological drought variation and its relationships with agricultural drought which can also be applied in other areas graphical abstract ga1 keywords spatio temporal variations gridded trend standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index copula model propagation time 1 introduction drought is a periodic climate anomaly phenomenon which is mainly driven by the natural climate variability and has the characteristics of slow development long duration and wide influence range schubert et al 2004 vicente serrano et al 2010 van loon et al 2016 from 1980 2009 the average annual economic loss caused by drought disaster was 17 33 billion dollars in the world while the average annual loss increased to 23 125 billion dollars from 2010 to 2017 far exceeding the growth rate of other meteorological disasters buda et al 2018 additionally the formation and development of drought disaster not only include complex dynamic process and multi scale water and energy cycle mechanism but also involve many fields such as meteorology agriculture hydrology ecology and social economy bae et al 2019 xu et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 the problem of drought is gradually developing from the superficial understanding of drought to the quantitative understanding of its objective characteristics and the in depth revelation of its formation mechanism chen and sun 2017 the exploration of spatio temporal characteristics of drought can provide a foundation for the optimal allocation of water resources the efficient utilization of agricultural water and the formulation of drought mitigation measures dorjsuren et al 2016 heudorfer and stahl 2017 huang et al 2017 the drought situations in america were investigated using observations and ensemble climate simulations which proved that the temporal and spatial variations of several severe droughts were obviously affected by sea surface temperature sst forcing seager and hoerling 2014 the spatiotemporal characteristics of drought were assessed in the heihe river basin with drought exhibiting a significant upward trend in the middle and lower reaches from 1961 to 2014 feng and su 2019 the duration area frequency and severity of drought were analyzed using seasonal and annual standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei for canada which demonstrated that there was a prevalent drying trend in southwestern canada yang et al 2020 in the aspect of research on drought and teleconnection factors previous studies focused on the relationship between drought and a certain teleconnection factor for example the drought evolution in the bar el ghazal region may be related to the el niño southern oscillation enso movement pattern awange et al 2014 the consecutive droughts were mainly caused by the decadal transition of negative phase arctic oscillation ao in southwest china since 2000 tan et al 2016 the spring drought in the korean peninsula from 1976 to 2013 was mostly affected by the north atlantic oscillation nao so the future spring drought fluctuation can be predicted according to the variation of nao kim et al 2017 pacific decadal oscillation pdo was one of the dynamic drivers of drought in canada with a positive pdo contributing to drier conditions yang et al 2020 these studies focusing on the relationships between drought and teleconnection factors have been mainly limited to two variables not involving the concurrent relationships among multiple variables also the aforementioned researches were carried out only using pearson or spearman s correlation and the relationships were rarely available from a perspective of multiple time scales seyoum 2018 however the drought fluctuation process is very complex and may be simultaneously affected by more than two teleconnection factors which requires the exploration of coupled effects of multiple teleconnection factors on drought ng and chan 2012 hu and si 2016 the occurrence development and influence scope of meteorological drought not only have a significant impact on crop growth and grain yield but also have many adverse aspects on industrial production and urban life lu et al 2011 ayantobo et al 2019 huang et al 2019 from 1961 2017 the frequency of meteorological drought was high in the eastern monsoon area of china ma et al 2020 compared with historical periods the duration intensity and affected area of meteorological drought were shown to increase based on the coupled model inter comparison project phase 6 projections xu et al 2021 meteorological drought will lead to agricultural drought in south korea when a large amount of agricultural water consumption was expected from march to september bae et al 2019 the highest correlations between meteorological and agricultural drought were found in relation to the month of july and with a two months accumulation period in central italy vergni et al 2021 in morocco the spatial consistency of meteorological and agricultural drought over rainfed agriculture was more important than over the vegetation cover ezzine et al 2014 the large scale ocean atmosphere oscillations controlled the meteorological and agricultural drought across iran rezaei 2021 overall meteorological drought is closely related to agricultural drought and the relationship between them is non linear and complex leng et al 2015 the lag time of agricultural drought responding to meteorological drought has a noticeably seasonal characteristic characterized by short response in summer and long response in autumn huang et al 2015 the summer and growing season have a stronger response of drought propagation compared with spring and autumn li et al 2020a ding et al 2021 although existing studies have deepened our understanding of meteorological drought and its relationships with agricultural drought most of the current studies mainly focus on the regional scale and are insufficient to capture the differences of drought propagation among different river basins furthermore in view of the regionality and complexity of drought the understanding of the causes of drought needs to be further improved in addition previous researches are mainly focused on the impact of one factor teleconnection on drought while the investigation of combined effects of multiple factors has not been reported in china it is necessary to thoroughly identify the dynamic variation of meteorological drought and profoundly reveal the relationships between meteorological and agricultural drought from a perspective of different river basins across china therefore the primary objectives of this study are 1 to investigate the temporal evolution and spatial distribution of meteorological drought 2 to identify the gridded meteorological drought trend characteristics 3 to determine the copula based meteorological drought return period and 4 to clarify the relationships between meteorological and agricultural drought quantitatively 2 dataset and methodology 2 1 study area china is located in the east of asia and the west coast of the pacific ocean with a vast territorial area of approximately 9 6 million km2 as seen from fig 1 there are nine major river basins in china i e songhua and liao river basin slb continental river basin cb hai river basin hb yellow river basin yb huai river basin hrb yangtze river basin yrb southwestern river basin swb southeast river basin seb and pearl river basin prb the details of the above nine major river basins and mainland china mc are shown in table 1 the agricultural production structure of china is mainly dominated by cultivation forestry and animal husbandry affected by drought the average annual grain losses were 228 49 billion kilogram and the average annual crop areas were 22 19 million hectares from 1978 to 2018 guan et al 2021 due to various climate characteristics and underlying surface conditions in different watersheds we need to explore the dynamic variations of drought at the watershed scale thus it is of great significance to investigate the drought disaster in china for strengthening the drought resistance ensuring the national food security satisfying the water utilization for people s life and industrial and agricultural production and protecting the ecological environment 2 2 dataset 2 2 1 meteorological station data the monthly precipitation average temperature maximum temperature minimum temperature average relative humidity average vapor pressure sunshine duration and average wind speed of 613 meteorological stations were selected in china from 1960 to 2019 which were obtained from the ground climatological datasets produced by the china meteorological administration http data cma cn after careful screening and strict quality control a total of 607 meteorological stations data passed the homogeneity test and correction and the data quality had been improved and showed good consistency 2 2 2 modis satellite data the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis is developed by national aeronautics and space administration nasa to detect the global climate change and the impact of human activities on climate dorjsuren et al 2016 modis satellite data has the advantages of free access wide spectral range convenient data acquisition and high update frequency in this study the monthly normalized difference vegetation index ndvi data of modis during 2000 2019 were obtained from nasa website with a spatial resolution of 1 km since there are some unreliable pixels in the original data of modis remote sensing satellite we have screened out the pixels with reliable quality according to the quality assurance documents meanwhile we performed quality control steps completely according to mod13 user s guide https lpdaac usgs gov sites default files public product documentation mod13 user guide pdf additionally the maximum value composite method was used to synthesize 16 day ndvi into monthly ndvi dataset which can minimize some effects of cloud cover atmospheric interference and solar zenith angle holben 1986 2 2 3 digital elevation model data the digital elevation model data was derived from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm with a spatial resolution of 1 km the srtm dataset adopts wgs84 ellipsoid projection and can cover more than 80 of the earth s land surface which is jointly measured by nasa the state bureau of surveying and mapping and the german and italian space agencies 2 2 4 teleconnection factors in this study eight large scale atmospheric circulation indices were utilized during 1960 2019 including the enso pdo nao ao atlantic multi decadal oscillation amo dipole mode index dmi north pacific index npi and pacific north american pna to clarify the dynamic relationships between drought and teleconnection factors the abbreviation time period and source of teleconnection factors used in this study are described in table 2 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei spei combines the advantages of standardized precipitation index spi and palmer drought severity index pdsi which can reflect the cumulative effect of meteorological drought at different time scales and has a good application prospect zuo et al 2019 the spatial interpolation results of spei calculated by using meteorological station data were compared finally kriging interpolation was adopted to interpolate spei to raster data with a spatial resolution of 1 km so as to compare with vegetation condition index vci with the same spatial resolution aalto et al 2013 wang et al 2018 specifically a positive spei value denotes no drought and a negative spei value 0 5 indicates different levels of drought furthermore the classification and value ranges of spei are shown in table 3 more details on the spei calculation can be found in vicente serrano et al 2010 2 3 2 vegetation condition index vci vci is calculated based on the ndvi values for many years and can reflect the earth s surface vegetation coverage or crop growth condition which is widely used in agricultural drought monitoring agutu et al 2017 javed et al 2021 vci is calculated as follows 1 v c i n d v i i n d v i m i n n d v i m a x n d v i m i n where ndvi i is the ndvi value in a particular period and ndvi max and ndvi min are the maximum and minimum ndvi values in this period 2 3 3 extreme point symmetric mode decomposition esmd the extreme point symmetric mode decomposition esmd method utilizes the internal extreme point symmetric interpolation to replace the outer envelope interpolation in empirical mode decomposition and ensemble empirical mode decomposition methods and optimizes the residual components to become the adaptive global moving average of the entire data sequence wang and li 2013 additionally esmd method adopts self adaptive decomposition rules instead of prior basis functions which has the characteristics of local variability and self adaptability and is suitable for non linear and non stationary time series analysis details about the esmd method can be found in feng and su 2019 2 3 4 gridded trend identification method the time series often have autocorrelation which will affect the reliability of the traditional mann kendall trend test results the modified mann kendall mmk trend test method can eliminate the autocorrelation components in the data sequence and significantly improve the test ability of mann kendall method which is an effective nonparametric method to detect the change trend of time series in this study the mmk method was applied to the grid scale for revealing the gridded drought trend characteristics across china the detailed mmk method can be referred to guo et al 2019 2 3 5 copula based return period two characteristic variables drought severity and duration were identified based on run theory meanwhile six three parameter general extreme value gev pearson type iii p iii lognormal logn log logistic log l weibull wbl and generalized pareto gp distributions were selected to fit the marginal distribution functions of drought severity and duration the maximum likelihood method was used to estimate the parameters and the kolmogorov smirnov k s anderson darling a d and akaike information criterion aic were selected to test the goodness of fit gof vicente serrano et al 2012 sherly et al 2016 after fitting the optimal marginal distribution function of drought severity and duration five widely used copula functions t copula normal copula frank copula clayton copula and gumbel copula were selected to establish the copula model of joint distribution table 4 furthermore based on the principle of the highest gof with the smallest root mean square error rmse aic and bayesian information criterion bic values the three evaluation indices were calculated respectively to determine the optimal copula model 2 3 6 bivariate and multivariate cross wavelet transform technology the cross wavelet transform technology is a commonly used method to test the multi scale relationship between two variables in hydrology meteorology soil science and other fields the multivariate cross wavelet transform is an improvement of the traditional bivariate cross wavelet transform which can be used to analyze the relationship among multiple variables and has the ability to characterize the local characteristics of non stationary signals in both time and frequency domains ng and chan 2012 hu and si 2016 nalley et al 2019 more details on the cross wavelet transform technology can be found in nalley et al 2019 3 results 3 1 spatio temporal variations of meteorological drought 3 1 1 temporal characteristics as shown in fig 2 the annual spei time series were decomposed based on esmd method and four intrinsic mode function imf components and a trend item r can be obtained the trend item r reflected the fluctuation of the whole time series during the study period and also depicted the overall change characteristics of meteorological drought additionally the contribution rates of each imf component and trend item r to the original sequence were 32 29 19 32 6 06 3 55 and 38 78 respectively the change of spei was mainly affected by imf1 and imf2 with a total variance contribution rate of 51 61 apparently the original spei data showed a downward trend which was consistent with trend item r indicating that the overall meteorological drought trend was increasing in china in particular the worst meteorological drought occurred in 2011 during 1960 2019 with a minimum spei of 0 81 besides the average period of each imf component was calculated by using fast fourier transform to analyze the inherent multi time scale oscillation in spei sequence it could be concluded that the meteorological drought had 2 07 years and 5 years periodic characteristics on an inter annual scale and 10 years and 30 years periodic characteristics on an inter decadal scale in china monthly spei can reflect the change characteristics of meteorological drought for a short time period fig 3 obviously the temporal variation characteristics of meteorological drought were different in each sub basin during 1960 2019 fig 3a i the most obvious drought increasing trend occurred in the cb with an spei linear tendency rate of 0 0055 10a in mc meteorological drought showed an upward trend with an spei linear tendency rate of 0 0036 10a fig 3j on a monthly scale the worst meteorological drought with a minimum spei value in the slb cb hb yb hrb yrb swb seb prb and mc occurred in april 2014 2 07 october 2006 1 58 may 2001 2 06 march 2013 2 13 october 2006 2 06 february 1999 1 53 april 1999 1 59 august 2011 1 60 march 2011 2 61 and august 2011 1 01 respectively the most serious meteorological drought in each region occurred after the 1990s which can be inferred that extreme drought events were more likely to occur after the 1990s as depicted in fig 4 the dynamic evolutions and cumulative effects of meteorological drought can be obtained by calculating the spei values at different timescales 1 24 months generally the meteorological drought was aggravating across china especially since the 1990s in addition with the increase of time scales the linear tendency rate of spei decreased gradually the dynamic evolution characteristics of meteorological drought were different in each sub basin with minimum spei linear tendency rates of 0 006 10a 0 039 10a 0 016 10a 0 016 10a 0 017 10a 0 011 10a 0 004 10a 0 004 10a and 0 006 10a respectively fig 4a i for the whole country fig 4j spei showed a downward trend at all time scales with linear tendency rates decreasing gradually from 0 003 10a spei 1 to 0 011 10a spei 24 3 1 2 spatial distribution in order to reflect the dynamic change of meteorological drought in the driest year the spatial distribution of meteorological drought during 2011 is depicted in fig 5 according to the statistical results of the average spei for all pixels in table 5 the average monthly spei ranged from 1 01 in august to 0 31 in december in general from january to april the average spei gradually decreased from 0 32 to 0 51 indicating that meteorological drought was emerging in april subsequently the meteorological drought gradually aggravated and the most serious drought occurred in august with a minimum spei value of 1 01 then the meteorological drought gradually relieved from september to october and terminated in november with an average spei value of 0 02 the percentage of drought area pda reached the maximum value 84 1 in august and the minimum value 13 4 in december additionally from january to december the worst meteorological drought with minimum spei values occurred in the cb 0 66 prb 1 07 prb 2 61 swb 1 10 slb 1 79 yb 1 46 cb 1 54 seb 1 60 swb 1 45 swb 1 15 hb 0 67 and swb 0 44 respectively fig 5a l 3 2 gridded drought trend identification based on mmk trend test the monthly and seasonal trend characteristics of spei at the grid scale are shown in fig 6 through calculating the statistical trend characteristics for all pixels in each region we can get the trend characteristic z s values of spei across china during 1960 2019 fig 7 z s 0 shows an increasing drought trend and z s 0 indicates a decreasing drought trend on a monthly scale the average z s values of spei were 0 73 1 45 0 45 0 27 0 75 0 70 1 05 1 21 0 45 0 51 0 52 and 0 04 respectively fig 6a l obviously meteorological drought showed an upward trend from march to november and a downward trend in december january and february furthermore the pda with an increasing trend ranged from 22 8 in december to 94 1 in october the largest pda 23 6 with a significant upward trend p 0 01 occurred in april on a seasonal scale the average z s values across china were 1 33 0 87 1 35 and 0 74 respectively implying that meteorological droughts were increasing in spring summer and autumn and decreasing in winter fig 6m p the pda with an increasing trend in spring summer autumn and winter was 85 8 77 4 97 7 and 12 9 respectively meanwhile the largest pda 23 7 with a significant upward trend p 0 01 occurred in spring noticeably the increasing trend of meteorological drought was significant at the 0 01 level in the cb for spring the decreasing trend of meteorological drought was significant at the 0 05 level in the slb for winter 3 3 drought return period based on copula models 3 3 1 copula models the kendall and spearman rank tests were carried out on the drought severity and duration identified based on run theory with kendall rank correlation coefficient τ and spearman rank correlation coefficient ρ s representing the correlation between drought severity and duration the τ values were all above 0 67 p 0 01 and reached the maximum value 0 77 in the swb meanwhile the ρ s values were all above 0 79 p 0 01 and reached the maximum value 0 89 in the swb as presented in table 6 the optimal copula model was frank copula in mc with the minimum rmse aic and bic values of 0 21 125 10 and 123 39 for each sub basin the optimal copula model was normal copula in the cb hb and swb and was frank copula in other sub basins the gof evaluation results of the selected optimal copula model were acceptable with the minimum rmse aic and bic values between theoretical and empirical copula model generally the optimal copula model was frank copula for six sub basins and the whole country indicating that frank copula was the most appropriate copula model in china 3 3 2 return period fig 8 shows the meteorological drought return period isolines based on the selected optimal copula model across china the optimal copula model was different in each region with frank copula in the slb yb hrb yrb seb prb and mc and normal copula in the cb hb and swb the number of drought events was 41 in mc and 70 121 in each sub basin during 1960 2019 table 7 in mc the average drought severity and duration were 1 02 and 1 95 months with drought severity of 5 88 drought duration of 10 months and drought return period of 18 34 years in the most serious drought event for each sub basin the maximum drought severity ranged from 4 14 to 7 37 and the longest drought duration ranged from 6 to 11 months additionally there was a drought event with a return period of more than 20 years in the yb and swb specifically there was a drought event in the swb with drought severity of 7 20 drought duration of 11 months and drought return period of approximately 25 years 24 26 years the average drought severity reached the minimum value 1 03 in the yrb and the maximum value 1 55 in the hrb with a difference of only 0 52 meanwhile the average drought duration reached the minimum value 1 82 months in the yb and the maximum value 2 31 months in the swb with a difference of only 0 49 months overall with the increase of drought severity and duration the corresponding drought frequency decreased and the drought return period increased 3 4 propagation dynamics from meteorological to agricultural drought in order to quantitatively reveal the propagation characteristics we compared the correlation between vci and spei at different time scales 1 24 months and considered the time scale corresponding to the maximum correlation p 0 05 as the propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought fig 9 apparently agricultural drought had delayed responses on meteorological drought and the response time was different in each sub basin due to various climatic hydrological and underlying surface conditions in china fig 9a i in mc the propagation time from january to december was 7 months 7 months 4 months 5 months 4 months 3 months 3 months 2 months 6 months 7 months 5 months and 8 months with the corresponding correlation coefficient r values of 0 65 0 68 0 73 0 77 0 77 0 78 0 78 0 80 0 71 0 71 0 69 and 0 62 respectively fig 9j generally the propagation time was longer in winter 7 8 months and shorter in summer 2 3 months with an average lower r value of 0 65 in winter and an average higher r value of 0 79 in summer 3 5 dynamic relationships between drought and teleconnection factors 3 5 1 bivariate wavelet coherence fig 10 illustrates the cross wavelet transforms between spei and teleconnection factors enso pdo nao ao amo dmi npi and pna from which we can observe the dynamic links between meteorological drought and teleconnection factors there are four significant resonance periods with positive correlations between spei and enso fig 10a at scale of 20 38 months 1963 1968 16 32 months 1982 1989 16 38 months 1994 2015 and 16 24 months 2015 2016 there are three significant resonance periods with positive correlations between spei and pdo fig 10b at scale of 16 32 months 1996 2002 24 32 months 2008 2010 and 96 128 months 1993 2007 fig 10c shows that nao is negatively correlated with spei at scale of 26 32 months 1997 2002 and 24 38 months 2008 2013 and positively correlated with spei at scale of 120 136 months 1997 2004 similarly the relationships between spei and ao amo dmi npi and pna are depicted in fig 10d h in addition there is a short term intermittent oscillation period of 1 16 months between spei and teleconnection factors from 1960 to 2019 it is worth noting that enso is the dominant teleconnection factor on drought in china the cross wavelet energy spectrum can identify the correlation between two sequences in the high energy region while the wavelet coherence can analyze the detailed mutual features in the low energy region fig 11 there are four obvious positive correlations between spei and enso fig 11a at scale of 18 34 months 1963 1968 16 32 months 1982 1990 16 30 months 1996 2000 and 96 134 months 1995 2007 furthermore the correlation is different between drought and other teleconnection factors in both time and frequency domains fig 11b h 3 5 2 multivariate wavelet coherence since enso was the dominant teleconnection factor on drought we applied multivariate cross wavelet transform between spei enso and other teleconnection factors pdo nao ao amo dmi npi and pna to reveal the coupled effect of two teleconnection factors on drought fig 12 it can be observed from fig 12a that spei enso is closely related to pdo at scale of 18 34 months 1963 1969 16 24 months 1982 1986 16 24 months 1991 2000 28 36 months 1991 2000 48 60 months 1991 2000 and 96 128 months 1994 2004 there are five significant correlations between spei enso and nao at scale of 36 48 months in 1973 1977 16 26 months in 1981 1985 16 26 months in 1996 2000 106 128 months in 1999 2006 and 18 32 months in 2004 2011 fig 12b similarly the links between spei enso and ao amo dmi npi and pna are described in fig 12c g overall the combination of enso and amo has the highest dependence on spei indicating that enso amo has the largest combined effects on drought in china the combination of enso and amo had the greatest impact on drought so we also explored the influence of enso amo and other teleconnection factors on drought fig 13 it can be concluded that the average wavelet coherence awc ranges from 0 79 to 0 86 and the percent area of significant coherence pasc ranges from 6 68 to 14 66 for one factor enso has the closest relationship on drought with an awc value of 0 86 and a pasc value of 14 66 for two factors enso amo is obviously related to drought with an awc value of 0 93 and a pasc value of 15 06 for three factors enso amo pdo has the strongest impact on drought with an awc value of 0 96 and a pasc value of 15 48 this implies that three factor combinations enso amo pdo are needed to explain the drought variation in china generally as the number of teleconnection factors increases the awc and pasc values increase suggesting that drought is affected simultaneously by multiple teleconnection factors table 8 4 discussion 4 1 the possible driving factors further exploring the possible driving factors of drought is of great practical significance for revealing the formation mechanism of drought formulating reasonable drought relief measures ensuring food security and maintaining social stability schubert et al 2004 chen and sun 2017 huang et al 2017 cheng et al 2021 climate change human activities and changes in water supply and demand constitute the driving force system of drought evolution zhou et al 2019 in recent 60 years the precipitation showed a slight upward trend at a rate of 5 07 mm 10a while the temperature significantly increased p 0 01 at a rate of 0 25 10a the increased temperature guaranteed an upward drought trend during the study period in china for each sub basin the minimum average annual precipitation 163 88 mm occurred in the cb with the most obvious temperature increasing trend at a rate of 0 32 10a resulting in the most significant drought increasing trend in this region meanwhile the severe drought in the cb was also affected by geographical location land cover and climate type the average annual temperature before and after the 1990s was 10 65 and 11 49 which was also the reason for the serious drought after the 1990s in china notably the precipitation reached the minimum value 709 99 mm in 2011 so the worst drought occurred in this year li et al 2020b the meteorological drought caused by insufficient precipitation often leads to the decline of soil water content resulting in crop yield reduction and agricultural drought emergence dash et al 2019 li et al 2020a therefore the investigation of propagation dynamics from meteorological to agricultural drought can further understand and recognize the formation mechanism of drought determine the appropriate irrigation period for agriculture reduce the agricultural losses caused by drought and monitor and predict the occurrence of agricultural drought which is of great significance for the rational planning of regional water resources and the alleviation and mitigation of drought disaster heudorfer and stahl 2017 agricultural drought is caused by the changes of vegetation greenness and soil moisture which usually occurs later than meteorological drought huang et al 2015 bae et al 2019 in addition anthropogenic activities land use change irrigation and reservoir regulation will also promote drought propagation through hydrological cycle zhou et al 2019 the dynamic propagation from meteorological to agricultural drought has seasonal characteristics and spatial heterogeneity due to deficient precipitation in winter and adequate precipitation in summer the propagation time is longer in winter and shorter in summer fig 9 furthermore the temperature and evapotranspiration in summer are larger than those in other seasons which accelerate the propagation time of drought to a certain extent vergni et al 2021 in winter the longer drought propagation time may be caused by snow melting huang et al 2017 in view of the adverse effects of agricultural drought water saving irrigation is the fundamental measure to reduce agricultural drought xu et al 2015 yang et al 2016 wu et al 2020a proposed the agricultural drought mitigation evaluation indices to quantitatively evaluate the influence of anti drought measures on agricultural drought additionally we should enhance the awareness of resisting drought and make farmers fully understand the importance of drought resistance production from the perspective of ensuring food security so as to minimize the losses caused by agricultural drought guan et al 2021 it is worth mentioning that the worst drought occurred in the cb with the minimum average annual precipitation therefore drought resistant crop varieties should be cultivated and artificial rainfall should be carried out in this region chen et al 2021 relevant studies awange et al 2014 forootan et al 2019 signified that teleconnection factor was a strong signal of the interaction between ocean and atmospheric circulation which can change the regional water heat balance conditions and then affect the development process of drought as found in subsection 3 5 there is a significant correlation between teleconnection factors and drought indicating that teleconnection factors play important roles in the evolution of drought the combination of teleconnection factors enso amo pdo is needed to explain the variability of drought in china fig 13 scholars have done lots of investigation on the causes of drought and gradually recognized that the large scale atmospheric circulation characteristics the forcing of sst anomalies inter decadal climate change caused by teleconnection anomalies will lead to drought dai 2011 lu et al 2011 jin et al 2013 horton et al 2015 also the anomalous land surface heat fluxes in the eurasian continent accompanied by the weak mongolia cyclone in summer make it difficult for warm and humid air to be accumulated which is conducive to the drought aggravation in northern china jin et al 2015 in addition human activity can also affect the development duration and severity of drought events by changing land atmosphere energy momentum and water exchange van loon et al 2016 xu et al 2019 sun et al 2016 reported that the temperature increased by 1 44 c in china from 1961 to 2013 the increase of potential evapotranspiration caused by temperature rise is one of the important reasons for the drought aggravation which could be because of the steady increase of greenhouse gas emissions horton et al 2015 chen and sun 2017 the change of land surface factors will enhance the surface reflectance strengthen the subsidence movement restrain the precipitation occurrence and lead to drought cheng et al 2021 moreover the surface water utilization groundwater exploitation artificial irrigation and water conservancy project construction can directly interfere with the water circulation system which will affect the water revenue and expenditure in the process of drought formation wu et al 2020b pointed out that the temperature will rise in the future which may lead to the reduction of water resources and the aggravation of drought therefore we should economically utilize water resources make unified planning and management of surface water and groundwater and improve people s water saving awareness so as to strengthen the drought resistance across china 4 2 uncertainties several aspects of uncertainty are encountered in this study firstly it is difficult to avoid uncertainty since meteorological station data will be affected by station migration instrument observation and anthropogenic influence hu et al 2015 carbone et al 2018 in this study the meteorological station data was strictly checked and controlled for consistency and finally the data quality met the requirements additionally the uncertainty of remote sensing satellite data exists in the confusion of real information and noise in remotely sensed images due to the influence of cloud fog and atmospheric conditions we have carried out savitzky golay s g filtering for modis satellite data which can effectively reduce the noise and greatly improve data quality so as to establish a set of reliable and high quality modis time series wang et al 2018 secondly the selection of different marginal distribution functions of drought severity and duration will result in different results in this study six three parameter distribution functions gev p iii logn log l wbl and gp were selected which could adapt to all non negative skewness vicente serrano et al 2012 thirdly rmse aic and bic were adopted to test the effectiveness of copula which could reduce the uncertainty and determine the optimal copula model fan et al 2018 finally uncertainty also existed in selecting different copula models to construct the joint distribution of drought severity and duration five commonly used copula models t copula normal copula frank copula clayton copula and gumbel copula were selected which had been widely applied in joint probability investigation zhang et al 2018 ayantobo et al 2019 4 3 advantages and limitations in view of the large geographical scope various climate types and topographic features in china it is necessary to study the spatial differences of drought in each sub basin esmd time frequency decomposition can extract the periodic oscillation and trend components in the original signal which can accurately describe the fluctuation of the original sequence and has significant advantages in drought research feng and su 2019 ma et al 2020 indicated that the drought across china in recent decades was decreasing firstly and then increasing which was consistent with the drought variation obtained by esmd decomposition in this study the multiple time scale characteristics of drought indicated that spei at different time scales had different sensitivities to precipitation and temperature fig 4 which was helpful to detect the long term water deficit status seiler et al 2002 besides the gridded drought trend identification showed that drought was increasing which was consistent with the temporal evolution characteristics of drought in subsection 3 1 1 based on run theory 9 drought events occurred before the 1990s with an average drought severity and duration of 0 80 and 1 44 months and 32 drought events occurred after the 1990s with an average drought severity and duration of 1 09 and 2 09 months furthermore drought return period can be used to quantitatively evaluate the drought characteristics from a perspective of probability cancelliere and salas 2010 salvadori and de michele 2015 wang et al 2020 the most serious drought occurred in the year of 2011 across china with a drought return period of 18 34 years the worst drought was identified in 2011 which was consistent with the findings of li et al 2020b and javed et al 2021 moreover the propagation dynamics from meteorological to agricultural drought will help us to carry out the research on the prediction of agricultural drought huang et al 2015 agutu et al 2017 many previous studies dai 2011 jin et al 2013 kim et al 2017 have detected the relationships between drought and teleconnection factors the accurate observation of sst anomalies obviously improves the ability of drought prediction especially in the areas with strong teleconnection seager and hoerling 2014 schubert et al 2016 teleconnection factors can weaken the intensity of walker circulation resulting in deficient precipitation and frequent drought huang et al 2019 enso is a strong climate signal produced by the interaction between atmospheric circulation and ocean in the process of global change and it is also a primary driving factor of extreme weather conditions schubert et al 2016 zhai et al 2016 as for multiple factors the combination of enso amo and pdo has the most obvious relationship with drought fig 13 therefore enso amo and pdo can be used as the input factors of drought early warning system to improve the accuracy of drought prediction which has important practical significance for ensuring the sustainable development of water resources and ecosystem in addition a comparison between the bivariate and multivariate cross wavelet transform showed that the awc value increased when more factors were combined which could be found in other researches nalley et al 2019 su et al 2019 as the number of independent factors increased pasc value did not increase significantly which may be attributed to the collinearity and simultaneously increased statistical significance threshold when an additional variable was added ng and chan 2012 hu and si 2016 in summary little research has focused on the coupled effects of enso amo and pdo on drought in china and our results may provide a new perspective for future researches although the dynamic variations of drought were identified in this paper in order to recognize the drought phenomenon more clearly other meteorological factors temperature wind speed and sunshine hours underlying surface conditions topography and land cover and human activity field management and crop irrigation should be comprehensively considered in the future additionally the positive and negative effects of teleconnection factor on drought and the synergistic influences of multiple teleconnection factors need to be further clarified so as to realize the accurate prediction of drought events forootan et al 2019 moreover some suggested measures limiting the size of agricultural drought should be implemented which may be a potential topic for future research 5 conclusions in this study the dynamic variations of meteorological drought were investigated across china during 1960 2019 additionally the temporal evolution spatial distribution gridded trend characteristics and return period of meteorological drought were quantitatively identified during the study period subsequently the dynamic relationships between meteorological and agricultural drought were revealed based on bivariate and multivariate cross wavelet transform technology from the results major conclusions are given as follows 1 based on esmd method the dynamic variation of meteorological drought was mainly affected by imf1 and imf2 with a total variance contribution rate of 51 61 overall meteorological drought was aggravating across china from 1960 to 2019 with a 2 07 year and 5 year periodic characteristics on an inter annual scale specifically the worst meteorological drought occurred in 2011 during the study period with a minimum spei value of 0 81 2 in the driest year of 2011 the average monthly spei ranged from 1 01 in august to 0 31 in december additionally on a monthly scale meteorological drought showed an upward trend from march to november and a downward trend in january february and december on a seasonal scale meteorological drought was increasing in spring summer and autumn while it was decreasing in winter 3 based on the gof test of different copula models frank copula was considered to be the optimal copula model in china in the most serious drought event the drought severity and duration were 5 88 and 10 months with a drought return period of 18 34 years 4 in mc the minimum 2 months and maximum 8 months propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought occurred in august and december respectively generally the propagation time was longer in winter 7 8 months and shorter in summer 2 3 months with an average lower r value of 0 65 in winter and an average higher r value of 0 79 in summer in summary this study thoroughly investigated the dynamic variation of meteorological drought and revealed the relationships between meteorological and agricultural drought across china

9746,under the background of climate warming the global water cycle is gradually accelerating which will lead to increased drought frequency and severity china is one of the countries with the highest drought risk and the most serious drought impact accompanied by abnormal and variable drought characteristics in recent decades however the dynamic variation of meteorological drought and its complicated relationships with agricultural drought are still unclear across china in this study the characteristics of meteorological drought were comprehensively identified across china during 1960 2019 the spatio temporal variations and gridded trend characteristics of meteorological drought were revealed during the study period subsequently the return period of meteorological drought was quantitatively determined based on copula models finally the relationships between meteorological and agricultural drought were explicitly clarified the results indicated that 1 meteorological drought showed an increasing trend across china from 1960 to 2019 especially since the 1990s 2 the most serious meteorological drought occurred in 2011 with a minimum standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei value of 0 81 3 the percentage of drought area pda with an increasing trend in spring summer autumn and winter was 85 8 77 4 97 7 and 12 9 respectively 4 the most appropriate copula model of meteorological drought severity and duration was frank copula and 5 the propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought was longer in winter and shorter in summer which can determine the appropriate irrigation period and predict the occurrence of agricultural drought this study sheds new viewpoints into the identification of meteorological drought variation and its relationships with agricultural drought which can also be applied in other areas graphical abstract ga1 keywords spatio temporal variations gridded trend standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index copula model propagation time 1 introduction drought is a periodic climate anomaly phenomenon which is mainly driven by the natural climate variability and has the characteristics of slow development long duration and wide influence range schubert et al 2004 vicente serrano et al 2010 van loon et al 2016 from 1980 2009 the average annual economic loss caused by drought disaster was 17 33 billion dollars in the world while the average annual loss increased to 23 125 billion dollars from 2010 to 2017 far exceeding the growth rate of other meteorological disasters buda et al 2018 additionally the formation and development of drought disaster not only include complex dynamic process and multi scale water and energy cycle mechanism but also involve many fields such as meteorology agriculture hydrology ecology and social economy bae et al 2019 xu et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 the problem of drought is gradually developing from the superficial understanding of drought to the quantitative understanding of its objective characteristics and the in depth revelation of its formation mechanism chen and sun 2017 the exploration of spatio temporal characteristics of drought can provide a foundation for the optimal allocation of water resources the efficient utilization of agricultural water and the formulation of drought mitigation measures dorjsuren et al 2016 heudorfer and stahl 2017 huang et al 2017 the drought situations in america were investigated using observations and ensemble climate simulations which proved that the temporal and spatial variations of several severe droughts were obviously affected by sea surface temperature sst forcing seager and hoerling 2014 the spatiotemporal characteristics of drought were assessed in the heihe river basin with drought exhibiting a significant upward trend in the middle and lower reaches from 1961 to 2014 feng and su 2019 the duration area frequency and severity of drought were analyzed using seasonal and annual standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei for canada which demonstrated that there was a prevalent drying trend in southwestern canada yang et al 2020 in the aspect of research on drought and teleconnection factors previous studies focused on the relationship between drought and a certain teleconnection factor for example the drought evolution in the bar el ghazal region may be related to the el niño southern oscillation enso movement pattern awange et al 2014 the consecutive droughts were mainly caused by the decadal transition of negative phase arctic oscillation ao in southwest china since 2000 tan et al 2016 the spring drought in the korean peninsula from 1976 to 2013 was mostly affected by the north atlantic oscillation nao so the future spring drought fluctuation can be predicted according to the variation of nao kim et al 2017 pacific decadal oscillation pdo was one of the dynamic drivers of drought in canada with a positive pdo contributing to drier conditions yang et al 2020 these studies focusing on the relationships between drought and teleconnection factors have been mainly limited to two variables not involving the concurrent relationships among multiple variables also the aforementioned researches were carried out only using pearson or spearman s correlation and the relationships were rarely available from a perspective of multiple time scales seyoum 2018 however the drought fluctuation process is very complex and may be simultaneously affected by more than two teleconnection factors which requires the exploration of coupled effects of multiple teleconnection factors on drought ng and chan 2012 hu and si 2016 the occurrence development and influence scope of meteorological drought not only have a significant impact on crop growth and grain yield but also have many adverse aspects on industrial production and urban life lu et al 2011 ayantobo et al 2019 huang et al 2019 from 1961 2017 the frequency of meteorological drought was high in the eastern monsoon area of china ma et al 2020 compared with historical periods the duration intensity and affected area of meteorological drought were shown to increase based on the coupled model inter comparison project phase 6 projections xu et al 2021 meteorological drought will lead to agricultural drought in south korea when a large amount of agricultural water consumption was expected from march to september bae et al 2019 the highest correlations between meteorological and agricultural drought were found in relation to the month of july and with a two months accumulation period in central italy vergni et al 2021 in morocco the spatial consistency of meteorological and agricultural drought over rainfed agriculture was more important than over the vegetation cover ezzine et al 2014 the large scale ocean atmosphere oscillations controlled the meteorological and agricultural drought across iran rezaei 2021 overall meteorological drought is closely related to agricultural drought and the relationship between them is non linear and complex leng et al 2015 the lag time of agricultural drought responding to meteorological drought has a noticeably seasonal characteristic characterized by short response in summer and long response in autumn huang et al 2015 the summer and growing season have a stronger response of drought propagation compared with spring and autumn li et al 2020a ding et al 2021 although existing studies have deepened our understanding of meteorological drought and its relationships with agricultural drought most of the current studies mainly focus on the regional scale and are insufficient to capture the differences of drought propagation among different river basins furthermore in view of the regionality and complexity of drought the understanding of the causes of drought needs to be further improved in addition previous researches are mainly focused on the impact of one factor teleconnection on drought while the investigation of combined effects of multiple factors has not been reported in china it is necessary to thoroughly identify the dynamic variation of meteorological drought and profoundly reveal the relationships between meteorological and agricultural drought from a perspective of different river basins across china therefore the primary objectives of this study are 1 to investigate the temporal evolution and spatial distribution of meteorological drought 2 to identify the gridded meteorological drought trend characteristics 3 to determine the copula based meteorological drought return period and 4 to clarify the relationships between meteorological and agricultural drought quantitatively 2 dataset and methodology 2 1 study area china is located in the east of asia and the west coast of the pacific ocean with a vast territorial area of approximately 9 6 million km2 as seen from fig 1 there are nine major river basins in china i e songhua and liao river basin slb continental river basin cb hai river basin hb yellow river basin yb huai river basin hrb yangtze river basin yrb southwestern river basin swb southeast river basin seb and pearl river basin prb the details of the above nine major river basins and mainland china mc are shown in table 1 the agricultural production structure of china is mainly dominated by cultivation forestry and animal husbandry affected by drought the average annual grain losses were 228 49 billion kilogram and the average annual crop areas were 22 19 million hectares from 1978 to 2018 guan et al 2021 due to various climate characteristics and underlying surface conditions in different watersheds we need to explore the dynamic variations of drought at the watershed scale thus it is of great significance to investigate the drought disaster in china for strengthening the drought resistance ensuring the national food security satisfying the water utilization for people s life and industrial and agricultural production and protecting the ecological environment 2 2 dataset 2 2 1 meteorological station data the monthly precipitation average temperature maximum temperature minimum temperature average relative humidity average vapor pressure sunshine duration and average wind speed of 613 meteorological stations were selected in china from 1960 to 2019 which were obtained from the ground climatological datasets produced by the china meteorological administration http data cma cn after careful screening and strict quality control a total of 607 meteorological stations data passed the homogeneity test and correction and the data quality had been improved and showed good consistency 2 2 2 modis satellite data the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis is developed by national aeronautics and space administration nasa to detect the global climate change and the impact of human activities on climate dorjsuren et al 2016 modis satellite data has the advantages of free access wide spectral range convenient data acquisition and high update frequency in this study the monthly normalized difference vegetation index ndvi data of modis during 2000 2019 were obtained from nasa website with a spatial resolution of 1 km since there are some unreliable pixels in the original data of modis remote sensing satellite we have screened out the pixels with reliable quality according to the quality assurance documents meanwhile we performed quality control steps completely according to mod13 user s guide https lpdaac usgs gov sites default files public product documentation mod13 user guide pdf additionally the maximum value composite method was used to synthesize 16 day ndvi into monthly ndvi dataset which can minimize some effects of cloud cover atmospheric interference and solar zenith angle holben 1986 2 2 3 digital elevation model data the digital elevation model data was derived from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm with a spatial resolution of 1 km the srtm dataset adopts wgs84 ellipsoid projection and can cover more than 80 of the earth s land surface which is jointly measured by nasa the state bureau of surveying and mapping and the german and italian space agencies 2 2 4 teleconnection factors in this study eight large scale atmospheric circulation indices were utilized during 1960 2019 including the enso pdo nao ao atlantic multi decadal oscillation amo dipole mode index dmi north pacific index npi and pacific north american pna to clarify the dynamic relationships between drought and teleconnection factors the abbreviation time period and source of teleconnection factors used in this study are described in table 2 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei spei combines the advantages of standardized precipitation index spi and palmer drought severity index pdsi which can reflect the cumulative effect of meteorological drought at different time scales and has a good application prospect zuo et al 2019 the spatial interpolation results of spei calculated by using meteorological station data were compared finally kriging interpolation was adopted to interpolate spei to raster data with a spatial resolution of 1 km so as to compare with vegetation condition index vci with the same spatial resolution aalto et al 2013 wang et al 2018 specifically a positive spei value denotes no drought and a negative spei value 0 5 indicates different levels of drought furthermore the classification and value ranges of spei are shown in table 3 more details on the spei calculation can be found in vicente serrano et al 2010 2 3 2 vegetation condition index vci vci is calculated based on the ndvi values for many years and can reflect the earth s surface vegetation coverage or crop growth condition which is widely used in agricultural drought monitoring agutu et al 2017 javed et al 2021 vci is calculated as follows 1 v c i n d v i i n d v i m i n n d v i m a x n d v i m i n where ndvi i is the ndvi value in a particular period and ndvi max and ndvi min are the maximum and minimum ndvi values in this period 2 3 3 extreme point symmetric mode decomposition esmd the extreme point symmetric mode decomposition esmd method utilizes the internal extreme point symmetric interpolation to replace the outer envelope interpolation in empirical mode decomposition and ensemble empirical mode decomposition methods and optimizes the residual components to become the adaptive global moving average of the entire data sequence wang and li 2013 additionally esmd method adopts self adaptive decomposition rules instead of prior basis functions which has the characteristics of local variability and self adaptability and is suitable for non linear and non stationary time series analysis details about the esmd method can be found in feng and su 2019 2 3 4 gridded trend identification method the time series often have autocorrelation which will affect the reliability of the traditional mann kendall trend test results the modified mann kendall mmk trend test method can eliminate the autocorrelation components in the data sequence and significantly improve the test ability of mann kendall method which is an effective nonparametric method to detect the change trend of time series in this study the mmk method was applied to the grid scale for revealing the gridded drought trend characteristics across china the detailed mmk method can be referred to guo et al 2019 2 3 5 copula based return period two characteristic variables drought severity and duration were identified based on run theory meanwhile six three parameter general extreme value gev pearson type iii p iii lognormal logn log logistic log l weibull wbl and generalized pareto gp distributions were selected to fit the marginal distribution functions of drought severity and duration the maximum likelihood method was used to estimate the parameters and the kolmogorov smirnov k s anderson darling a d and akaike information criterion aic were selected to test the goodness of fit gof vicente serrano et al 2012 sherly et al 2016 after fitting the optimal marginal distribution function of drought severity and duration five widely used copula functions t copula normal copula frank copula clayton copula and gumbel copula were selected to establish the copula model of joint distribution table 4 furthermore based on the principle of the highest gof with the smallest root mean square error rmse aic and bayesian information criterion bic values the three evaluation indices were calculated respectively to determine the optimal copula model 2 3 6 bivariate and multivariate cross wavelet transform technology the cross wavelet transform technology is a commonly used method to test the multi scale relationship between two variables in hydrology meteorology soil science and other fields the multivariate cross wavelet transform is an improvement of the traditional bivariate cross wavelet transform which can be used to analyze the relationship among multiple variables and has the ability to characterize the local characteristics of non stationary signals in both time and frequency domains ng and chan 2012 hu and si 2016 nalley et al 2019 more details on the cross wavelet transform technology can be found in nalley et al 2019 3 results 3 1 spatio temporal variations of meteorological drought 3 1 1 temporal characteristics as shown in fig 2 the annual spei time series were decomposed based on esmd method and four intrinsic mode function imf components and a trend item r can be obtained the trend item r reflected the fluctuation of the whole time series during the study period and also depicted the overall change characteristics of meteorological drought additionally the contribution rates of each imf component and trend item r to the original sequence were 32 29 19 32 6 06 3 55 and 38 78 respectively the change of spei was mainly affected by imf1 and imf2 with a total variance contribution rate of 51 61 apparently the original spei data showed a downward trend which was consistent with trend item r indicating that the overall meteorological drought trend was increasing in china in particular the worst meteorological drought occurred in 2011 during 1960 2019 with a minimum spei of 0 81 besides the average period of each imf component was calculated by using fast fourier transform to analyze the inherent multi time scale oscillation in spei sequence it could be concluded that the meteorological drought had 2 07 years and 5 years periodic characteristics on an inter annual scale and 10 years and 30 years periodic characteristics on an inter decadal scale in china monthly spei can reflect the change characteristics of meteorological drought for a short time period fig 3 obviously the temporal variation characteristics of meteorological drought were different in each sub basin during 1960 2019 fig 3a i the most obvious drought increasing trend occurred in the cb with an spei linear tendency rate of 0 0055 10a in mc meteorological drought showed an upward trend with an spei linear tendency rate of 0 0036 10a fig 3j on a monthly scale the worst meteorological drought with a minimum spei value in the slb cb hb yb hrb yrb swb seb prb and mc occurred in april 2014 2 07 october 2006 1 58 may 2001 2 06 march 2013 2 13 october 2006 2 06 february 1999 1 53 april 1999 1 59 august 2011 1 60 march 2011 2 61 and august 2011 1 01 respectively the most serious meteorological drought in each region occurred after the 1990s which can be inferred that extreme drought events were more likely to occur after the 1990s as depicted in fig 4 the dynamic evolutions and cumulative effects of meteorological drought can be obtained by calculating the spei values at different timescales 1 24 months generally the meteorological drought was aggravating across china especially since the 1990s in addition with the increase of time scales the linear tendency rate of spei decreased gradually the dynamic evolution characteristics of meteorological drought were different in each sub basin with minimum spei linear tendency rates of 0 006 10a 0 039 10a 0 016 10a 0 016 10a 0 017 10a 0 011 10a 0 004 10a 0 004 10a and 0 006 10a respectively fig 4a i for the whole country fig 4j spei showed a downward trend at all time scales with linear tendency rates decreasing gradually from 0 003 10a spei 1 to 0 011 10a spei 24 3 1 2 spatial distribution in order to reflect the dynamic change of meteorological drought in the driest year the spatial distribution of meteorological drought during 2011 is depicted in fig 5 according to the statistical results of the average spei for all pixels in table 5 the average monthly spei ranged from 1 01 in august to 0 31 in december in general from january to april the average spei gradually decreased from 0 32 to 0 51 indicating that meteorological drought was emerging in april subsequently the meteorological drought gradually aggravated and the most serious drought occurred in august with a minimum spei value of 1 01 then the meteorological drought gradually relieved from september to october and terminated in november with an average spei value of 0 02 the percentage of drought area pda reached the maximum value 84 1 in august and the minimum value 13 4 in december additionally from january to december the worst meteorological drought with minimum spei values occurred in the cb 0 66 prb 1 07 prb 2 61 swb 1 10 slb 1 79 yb 1 46 cb 1 54 seb 1 60 swb 1 45 swb 1 15 hb 0 67 and swb 0 44 respectively fig 5a l 3 2 gridded drought trend identification based on mmk trend test the monthly and seasonal trend characteristics of spei at the grid scale are shown in fig 6 through calculating the statistical trend characteristics for all pixels in each region we can get the trend characteristic z s values of spei across china during 1960 2019 fig 7 z s 0 shows an increasing drought trend and z s 0 indicates a decreasing drought trend on a monthly scale the average z s values of spei were 0 73 1 45 0 45 0 27 0 75 0 70 1 05 1 21 0 45 0 51 0 52 and 0 04 respectively fig 6a l obviously meteorological drought showed an upward trend from march to november and a downward trend in december january and february furthermore the pda with an increasing trend ranged from 22 8 in december to 94 1 in october the largest pda 23 6 with a significant upward trend p 0 01 occurred in april on a seasonal scale the average z s values across china were 1 33 0 87 1 35 and 0 74 respectively implying that meteorological droughts were increasing in spring summer and autumn and decreasing in winter fig 6m p the pda with an increasing trend in spring summer autumn and winter was 85 8 77 4 97 7 and 12 9 respectively meanwhile the largest pda 23 7 with a significant upward trend p 0 01 occurred in spring noticeably the increasing trend of meteorological drought was significant at the 0 01 level in the cb for spring the decreasing trend of meteorological drought was significant at the 0 05 level in the slb for winter 3 3 drought return period based on copula models 3 3 1 copula models the kendall and spearman rank tests were carried out on the drought severity and duration identified based on run theory with kendall rank correlation coefficient τ and spearman rank correlation coefficient ρ s representing the correlation between drought severity and duration the τ values were all above 0 67 p 0 01 and reached the maximum value 0 77 in the swb meanwhile the ρ s values were all above 0 79 p 0 01 and reached the maximum value 0 89 in the swb as presented in table 6 the optimal copula model was frank copula in mc with the minimum rmse aic and bic values of 0 21 125 10 and 123 39 for each sub basin the optimal copula model was normal copula in the cb hb and swb and was frank copula in other sub basins the gof evaluation results of the selected optimal copula model were acceptable with the minimum rmse aic and bic values between theoretical and empirical copula model generally the optimal copula model was frank copula for six sub basins and the whole country indicating that frank copula was the most appropriate copula model in china 3 3 2 return period fig 8 shows the meteorological drought return period isolines based on the selected optimal copula model across china the optimal copula model was different in each region with frank copula in the slb yb hrb yrb seb prb and mc and normal copula in the cb hb and swb the number of drought events was 41 in mc and 70 121 in each sub basin during 1960 2019 table 7 in mc the average drought severity and duration were 1 02 and 1 95 months with drought severity of 5 88 drought duration of 10 months and drought return period of 18 34 years in the most serious drought event for each sub basin the maximum drought severity ranged from 4 14 to 7 37 and the longest drought duration ranged from 6 to 11 months additionally there was a drought event with a return period of more than 20 years in the yb and swb specifically there was a drought event in the swb with drought severity of 7 20 drought duration of 11 months and drought return period of approximately 25 years 24 26 years the average drought severity reached the minimum value 1 03 in the yrb and the maximum value 1 55 in the hrb with a difference of only 0 52 meanwhile the average drought duration reached the minimum value 1 82 months in the yb and the maximum value 2 31 months in the swb with a difference of only 0 49 months overall with the increase of drought severity and duration the corresponding drought frequency decreased and the drought return period increased 3 4 propagation dynamics from meteorological to agricultural drought in order to quantitatively reveal the propagation characteristics we compared the correlation between vci and spei at different time scales 1 24 months and considered the time scale corresponding to the maximum correlation p 0 05 as the propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought fig 9 apparently agricultural drought had delayed responses on meteorological drought and the response time was different in each sub basin due to various climatic hydrological and underlying surface conditions in china fig 9a i in mc the propagation time from january to december was 7 months 7 months 4 months 5 months 4 months 3 months 3 months 2 months 6 months 7 months 5 months and 8 months with the corresponding correlation coefficient r values of 0 65 0 68 0 73 0 77 0 77 0 78 0 78 0 80 0 71 0 71 0 69 and 0 62 respectively fig 9j generally the propagation time was longer in winter 7 8 months and shorter in summer 2 3 months with an average lower r value of 0 65 in winter and an average higher r value of 0 79 in summer 3 5 dynamic relationships between drought and teleconnection factors 3 5 1 bivariate wavelet coherence fig 10 illustrates the cross wavelet transforms between spei and teleconnection factors enso pdo nao ao amo dmi npi and pna from which we can observe the dynamic links between meteorological drought and teleconnection factors there are four significant resonance periods with positive correlations between spei and enso fig 10a at scale of 20 38 months 1963 1968 16 32 months 1982 1989 16 38 months 1994 2015 and 16 24 months 2015 2016 there are three significant resonance periods with positive correlations between spei and pdo fig 10b at scale of 16 32 months 1996 2002 24 32 months 2008 2010 and 96 128 months 1993 2007 fig 10c shows that nao is negatively correlated with spei at scale of 26 32 months 1997 2002 and 24 38 months 2008 2013 and positively correlated with spei at scale of 120 136 months 1997 2004 similarly the relationships between spei and ao amo dmi npi and pna are depicted in fig 10d h in addition there is a short term intermittent oscillation period of 1 16 months between spei and teleconnection factors from 1960 to 2019 it is worth noting that enso is the dominant teleconnection factor on drought in china the cross wavelet energy spectrum can identify the correlation between two sequences in the high energy region while the wavelet coherence can analyze the detailed mutual features in the low energy region fig 11 there are four obvious positive correlations between spei and enso fig 11a at scale of 18 34 months 1963 1968 16 32 months 1982 1990 16 30 months 1996 2000 and 96 134 months 1995 2007 furthermore the correlation is different between drought and other teleconnection factors in both time and frequency domains fig 11b h 3 5 2 multivariate wavelet coherence since enso was the dominant teleconnection factor on drought we applied multivariate cross wavelet transform between spei enso and other teleconnection factors pdo nao ao amo dmi npi and pna to reveal the coupled effect of two teleconnection factors on drought fig 12 it can be observed from fig 12a that spei enso is closely related to pdo at scale of 18 34 months 1963 1969 16 24 months 1982 1986 16 24 months 1991 2000 28 36 months 1991 2000 48 60 months 1991 2000 and 96 128 months 1994 2004 there are five significant correlations between spei enso and nao at scale of 36 48 months in 1973 1977 16 26 months in 1981 1985 16 26 months in 1996 2000 106 128 months in 1999 2006 and 18 32 months in 2004 2011 fig 12b similarly the links between spei enso and ao amo dmi npi and pna are described in fig 12c g overall the combination of enso and amo has the highest dependence on spei indicating that enso amo has the largest combined effects on drought in china the combination of enso and amo had the greatest impact on drought so we also explored the influence of enso amo and other teleconnection factors on drought fig 13 it can be concluded that the average wavelet coherence awc ranges from 0 79 to 0 86 and the percent area of significant coherence pasc ranges from 6 68 to 14 66 for one factor enso has the closest relationship on drought with an awc value of 0 86 and a pasc value of 14 66 for two factors enso amo is obviously related to drought with an awc value of 0 93 and a pasc value of 15 06 for three factors enso amo pdo has the strongest impact on drought with an awc value of 0 96 and a pasc value of 15 48 this implies that three factor combinations enso amo pdo are needed to explain the drought variation in china generally as the number of teleconnection factors increases the awc and pasc values increase suggesting that drought is affected simultaneously by multiple teleconnection factors table 8 4 discussion 4 1 the possible driving factors further exploring the possible driving factors of drought is of great practical significance for revealing the formation mechanism of drought formulating reasonable drought relief measures ensuring food security and maintaining social stability schubert et al 2004 chen and sun 2017 huang et al 2017 cheng et al 2021 climate change human activities and changes in water supply and demand constitute the driving force system of drought evolution zhou et al 2019 in recent 60 years the precipitation showed a slight upward trend at a rate of 5 07 mm 10a while the temperature significantly increased p 0 01 at a rate of 0 25 10a the increased temperature guaranteed an upward drought trend during the study period in china for each sub basin the minimum average annual precipitation 163 88 mm occurred in the cb with the most obvious temperature increasing trend at a rate of 0 32 10a resulting in the most significant drought increasing trend in this region meanwhile the severe drought in the cb was also affected by geographical location land cover and climate type the average annual temperature before and after the 1990s was 10 65 and 11 49 which was also the reason for the serious drought after the 1990s in china notably the precipitation reached the minimum value 709 99 mm in 2011 so the worst drought occurred in this year li et al 2020b the meteorological drought caused by insufficient precipitation often leads to the decline of soil water content resulting in crop yield reduction and agricultural drought emergence dash et al 2019 li et al 2020a therefore the investigation of propagation dynamics from meteorological to agricultural drought can further understand and recognize the formation mechanism of drought determine the appropriate irrigation period for agriculture reduce the agricultural losses caused by drought and monitor and predict the occurrence of agricultural drought which is of great significance for the rational planning of regional water resources and the alleviation and mitigation of drought disaster heudorfer and stahl 2017 agricultural drought is caused by the changes of vegetation greenness and soil moisture which usually occurs later than meteorological drought huang et al 2015 bae et al 2019 in addition anthropogenic activities land use change irrigation and reservoir regulation will also promote drought propagation through hydrological cycle zhou et al 2019 the dynamic propagation from meteorological to agricultural drought has seasonal characteristics and spatial heterogeneity due to deficient precipitation in winter and adequate precipitation in summer the propagation time is longer in winter and shorter in summer fig 9 furthermore the temperature and evapotranspiration in summer are larger than those in other seasons which accelerate the propagation time of drought to a certain extent vergni et al 2021 in winter the longer drought propagation time may be caused by snow melting huang et al 2017 in view of the adverse effects of agricultural drought water saving irrigation is the fundamental measure to reduce agricultural drought xu et al 2015 yang et al 2016 wu et al 2020a proposed the agricultural drought mitigation evaluation indices to quantitatively evaluate the influence of anti drought measures on agricultural drought additionally we should enhance the awareness of resisting drought and make farmers fully understand the importance of drought resistance production from the perspective of ensuring food security so as to minimize the losses caused by agricultural drought guan et al 2021 it is worth mentioning that the worst drought occurred in the cb with the minimum average annual precipitation therefore drought resistant crop varieties should be cultivated and artificial rainfall should be carried out in this region chen et al 2021 relevant studies awange et al 2014 forootan et al 2019 signified that teleconnection factor was a strong signal of the interaction between ocean and atmospheric circulation which can change the regional water heat balance conditions and then affect the development process of drought as found in subsection 3 5 there is a significant correlation between teleconnection factors and drought indicating that teleconnection factors play important roles in the evolution of drought the combination of teleconnection factors enso amo pdo is needed to explain the variability of drought in china fig 13 scholars have done lots of investigation on the causes of drought and gradually recognized that the large scale atmospheric circulation characteristics the forcing of sst anomalies inter decadal climate change caused by teleconnection anomalies will lead to drought dai 2011 lu et al 2011 jin et al 2013 horton et al 2015 also the anomalous land surface heat fluxes in the eurasian continent accompanied by the weak mongolia cyclone in summer make it difficult for warm and humid air to be accumulated which is conducive to the drought aggravation in northern china jin et al 2015 in addition human activity can also affect the development duration and severity of drought events by changing land atmosphere energy momentum and water exchange van loon et al 2016 xu et al 2019 sun et al 2016 reported that the temperature increased by 1 44 c in china from 1961 to 2013 the increase of potential evapotranspiration caused by temperature rise is one of the important reasons for the drought aggravation which could be because of the steady increase of greenhouse gas emissions horton et al 2015 chen and sun 2017 the change of land surface factors will enhance the surface reflectance strengthen the subsidence movement restrain the precipitation occurrence and lead to drought cheng et al 2021 moreover the surface water utilization groundwater exploitation artificial irrigation and water conservancy project construction can directly interfere with the water circulation system which will affect the water revenue and expenditure in the process of drought formation wu et al 2020b pointed out that the temperature will rise in the future which may lead to the reduction of water resources and the aggravation of drought therefore we should economically utilize water resources make unified planning and management of surface water and groundwater and improve people s water saving awareness so as to strengthen the drought resistance across china 4 2 uncertainties several aspects of uncertainty are encountered in this study firstly it is difficult to avoid uncertainty since meteorological station data will be affected by station migration instrument observation and anthropogenic influence hu et al 2015 carbone et al 2018 in this study the meteorological station data was strictly checked and controlled for consistency and finally the data quality met the requirements additionally the uncertainty of remote sensing satellite data exists in the confusion of real information and noise in remotely sensed images due to the influence of cloud fog and atmospheric conditions we have carried out savitzky golay s g filtering for modis satellite data which can effectively reduce the noise and greatly improve data quality so as to establish a set of reliable and high quality modis time series wang et al 2018 secondly the selection of different marginal distribution functions of drought severity and duration will result in different results in this study six three parameter distribution functions gev p iii logn log l wbl and gp were selected which could adapt to all non negative skewness vicente serrano et al 2012 thirdly rmse aic and bic were adopted to test the effectiveness of copula which could reduce the uncertainty and determine the optimal copula model fan et al 2018 finally uncertainty also existed in selecting different copula models to construct the joint distribution of drought severity and duration five commonly used copula models t copula normal copula frank copula clayton copula and gumbel copula were selected which had been widely applied in joint probability investigation zhang et al 2018 ayantobo et al 2019 4 3 advantages and limitations in view of the large geographical scope various climate types and topographic features in china it is necessary to study the spatial differences of drought in each sub basin esmd time frequency decomposition can extract the periodic oscillation and trend components in the original signal which can accurately describe the fluctuation of the original sequence and has significant advantages in drought research feng and su 2019 ma et al 2020 indicated that the drought across china in recent decades was decreasing firstly and then increasing which was consistent with the drought variation obtained by esmd decomposition in this study the multiple time scale characteristics of drought indicated that spei at different time scales had different sensitivities to precipitation and temperature fig 4 which was helpful to detect the long term water deficit status seiler et al 2002 besides the gridded drought trend identification showed that drought was increasing which was consistent with the temporal evolution characteristics of drought in subsection 3 1 1 based on run theory 9 drought events occurred before the 1990s with an average drought severity and duration of 0 80 and 1 44 months and 32 drought events occurred after the 1990s with an average drought severity and duration of 1 09 and 2 09 months furthermore drought return period can be used to quantitatively evaluate the drought characteristics from a perspective of probability cancelliere and salas 2010 salvadori and de michele 2015 wang et al 2020 the most serious drought occurred in the year of 2011 across china with a drought return period of 18 34 years the worst drought was identified in 2011 which was consistent with the findings of li et al 2020b and javed et al 2021 moreover the propagation dynamics from meteorological to agricultural drought will help us to carry out the research on the prediction of agricultural drought huang et al 2015 agutu et al 2017 many previous studies dai 2011 jin et al 2013 kim et al 2017 have detected the relationships between drought and teleconnection factors the accurate observation of sst anomalies obviously improves the ability of drought prediction especially in the areas with strong teleconnection seager and hoerling 2014 schubert et al 2016 teleconnection factors can weaken the intensity of walker circulation resulting in deficient precipitation and frequent drought huang et al 2019 enso is a strong climate signal produced by the interaction between atmospheric circulation and ocean in the process of global change and it is also a primary driving factor of extreme weather conditions schubert et al 2016 zhai et al 2016 as for multiple factors the combination of enso amo and pdo has the most obvious relationship with drought fig 13 therefore enso amo and pdo can be used as the input factors of drought early warning system to improve the accuracy of drought prediction which has important practical significance for ensuring the sustainable development of water resources and ecosystem in addition a comparison between the bivariate and multivariate cross wavelet transform showed that the awc value increased when more factors were combined which could be found in other researches nalley et al 2019 su et al 2019 as the number of independent factors increased pasc value did not increase significantly which may be attributed to the collinearity and simultaneously increased statistical significance threshold when an additional variable was added ng and chan 2012 hu and si 2016 in summary little research has focused on the coupled effects of enso amo and pdo on drought in china and our results may provide a new perspective for future researches although the dynamic variations of drought were identified in this paper in order to recognize the drought phenomenon more clearly other meteorological factors temperature wind speed and sunshine hours underlying surface conditions topography and land cover and human activity field management and crop irrigation should be comprehensively considered in the future additionally the positive and negative effects of teleconnection factor on drought and the synergistic influences of multiple teleconnection factors need to be further clarified so as to realize the accurate prediction of drought events forootan et al 2019 moreover some suggested measures limiting the size of agricultural drought should be implemented which may be a potential topic for future research 5 conclusions in this study the dynamic variations of meteorological drought were investigated across china during 1960 2019 additionally the temporal evolution spatial distribution gridded trend characteristics and return period of meteorological drought were quantitatively identified during the study period subsequently the dynamic relationships between meteorological and agricultural drought were revealed based on bivariate and multivariate cross wavelet transform technology from the results major conclusions are given as follows 1 based on esmd method the dynamic variation of meteorological drought was mainly affected by imf1 and imf2 with a total variance contribution rate of 51 61 overall meteorological drought was aggravating across china from 1960 to 2019 with a 2 07 year and 5 year periodic characteristics on an inter annual scale specifically the worst meteorological drought occurred in 2011 during the study period with a minimum spei value of 0 81 2 in the driest year of 2011 the average monthly spei ranged from 1 01 in august to 0 31 in december additionally on a monthly scale meteorological drought showed an upward trend from march to november and a downward trend in january february and december on a seasonal scale meteorological drought was increasing in spring summer and autumn while it was decreasing in winter 3 based on the gof test of different copula models frank copula was considered to be the optimal copula model in china in the most serious drought event the drought severity and duration were 5 88 and 10 months with a drought return period of 18 34 years 4 in mc the minimum 2 months and maximum 8 months propagation time from meteorological to agricultural drought occurred in august and december respectively generally the propagation time was longer in winter 7 8 months and shorter in summer 2 3 months with an average lower r value of 0 65 in winter and an average higher r value of 0 79 in summer in summary this study thoroughly investigated the dynamic variation of meteorological drought and revealed the relationships between meteorological and agricultural drought across china

effects of canopy cover cc total soil water tsw aboveground biomass crop evapotranspiration etc and grain yield under mulched or nonmulched drip irrigation treatments with different water stress conditions were evaluated and compared the study found the model had a good simulation effect on cc excluding the rainfed treatment the root mean square error rmse was 15 2 the simulated values of tsw and etc were quite different from those observed in the field the tsw content was generally underestimated in the middle and late stages of maize growth with rmse values ranging from 12 8 to 60 7 mm the simulated etc values were generally high and the prediction error of some treatments exceeded 20 the model simulated the aboveground biomass and yield well in the calibration year 2016 and the rmse values were 0 9 2 t ha and 0 8 t ha respectively but the simulation performance of predicting yield declined in the verification year and the prediction error exceeded 20 compared with the mulched treatments the model had a better simulation effect on the nonmulched treatments in general the simulation of soil moisture under drip irrigation needs to be improved and the larger overestimation of transpiration and the lower underestimation of evaporation caused to overestimate the maize etc it is recommended to improve the simulation of mulched drip irrigation to ensure model

important role as a food crop accounting for nearly 30 of the world s total grain production fao 2019 in particular northeast china is the main maize production area and an important commercial grain base in china mo et al 2017 and its maize output accounts for approximately 40 of the national maize output however maize yield is limited by low and unevenly distributed rainfall low temperature and cold triggered damages in the mid temperate and semiarid regions of northeast china wang et al 2017 mulched drip irrigation technology combines the advantages of surface drip irrigation and film mulching technology which can improve the efficiency of water and fertilizer utilization improve the hydrothermal environment of a field and promote crop growth and yield increases li et al 2017 spehia et al 2013 wang et al 2018 after over 20 years of development mulched drip irrigation technology has been widely promoted in arid and semiarid areas in northwest china it is not only applied to crops with high economic value such as fruits vegetables and flowers but also has made remarkable progress on some field crops such as cotton tomato and potato wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 2017 in recent years mulched drip irrigation has been gradually increasingly used in northeast china to reduce the impact of low ground temperature and insufficient accumulated temperature sui et al 2018 wang et al 2021 crop growth models are dynamic simulations of the processes of crop growth and yield formation and crop response to environmental changes in the crop soil atmosphere system by means of computer technology and mathematical models sandhu and irmak 2019b as a result of long term research many crop models have been developed according to different crops and driving principles such as crop syst stöckle et al 2003 epic ko et al 2009 dssat jones et al 2003 wofost de wit et al 2019 and apsim keating et al 2003 the simulation of crop development and growth parameters is based on the complex interactions between climate variables crops soil parameters and management practices most models require very detailed input data and information about crop growth and some are not available for application in certain locations the aquacrop model raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 developed by the food and agriculture organization fao has a simple and user friendly interface and it is designed to balance simplicity accuracy and stability compared with other crop models the aquacrop model includes the most intuitive parameters used to simulate crop yield under different management conditions in addition the open source version of aquacrop aquacrop os can also be run in multiple programming languages and operating systems foster et al 2017 the performance of the model has been evaluated for most crops including maize ahmadi et al 2015 heng et al 2009 cotton farahani et al 2009 rice maniruzzaman et al 2015 soybean paredes et al 2015 wheat andarzian et al 2011 barley araya et al 2010 potato razzaghi et al 2017 and sunflower stricevic et al 2011 on the other hand a large number of studies have been carried out using the model after preliminary verification such as determining the best sowing date raja et al 2018 and optimizing farmland water and fertilizer management shrestha et al 2013 making decisions to future climate change deb et al 2015 and managing irrigation coupled with economic models garcía vila and fereres 2012 although many research results show that the aquacrop model performs well in simulating canopy coverage biomass yield and harvest index araya et al 2010 geerts et al 2009 greaves and wang 2016 there are also some studies that raise the question of the model heng et al 2009 verified the model using data from different locations in subsequent research and found that the model had a good ability to simulate the canopy cover aboveground biomass and yield but this effect was reduced under severe water stress katerji et al 2013 highlighted the performance of aquacrop model in simulating on maize and tomato yield biomass and etc under water stress they reported that the model overestimated the crop yield and underestimated the water consumption and the model performance vary caused by the different levels of water stress paredes et al 2015 found that the model had some serious limitations in estimating crop transpiration and soil evaporation in simulating soybean growth in north china and believed the reason was the method of calculating et used in the model sandhu and irmak 2019b evaluated the model using 6 years of measured data of subsurface drip irrigation in nebraska usa and concluded that the aquacrop model could accurately simulate the cc and yield in most cases but encountered great difficulties in simulating the soil moisture and biomass in addition the model has few studies on the simulation effect of mulching guo et al 2018 ran et al 2017 and most of the studies are mainly focused on non irrigation or surface irrigation while few on drip irrigation in conclusion although the aquacrop model has been widely used in the simulation of various crop growth in different climate types and farmland management conditions the simulation effect of the model fluctuates due to differences in climate location irrigation strategy and management measures therefore this study aims to evaluate the simulation effect of the aquacrop model on the growth of maize under drip irrigation mulched and nonmulched and determine the effectiveness and limitations of the model in practical applications to make the model can be used in agricultural production and management in the northeast china 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the data of this study mainly came from previous research on maize planting pattern under mulched drip irrigation in chifeng city 42 57 n 119 19 e at an elevation of 625 m above mean sea level inner mongolia china the area has a semiarid and continental monsoon climate the multiyear average temperature is 11 c the accumulated temperature above 10 c is 2900 c the frost free period is 135 d and the annual average rainfall is 343 mm and the annual evaporation is 2138 8 mm the soil texture of the 0 40 cm depth interval of the test site is sandy the soil below 40 cm is classified as a loam the average soil dry bulk density of the upper 1 m is 1 52 g cm 3 the average field water holding rate is 30 01 volume water content and the groundwater depth is 20 30 m 2 2 field management in this study we selected relevant field test data in 2013 2014 and 2016 for analysis in the experiment the maize variety of focus was xianyu 335 and the planting pattern adopted a wide and narrow row pattern with large ridges and double rows the wider row was 80 cm the narrower row was 40 cm the maize plant spacing was 20 cm and the planting density was 83 333 plants hm 2 drip irrigation belts were laid between the narrow rows of maize one tube controlled two rows of maize and the distance between the drip irrigation belts was 1 2 m in addition the agricultural film was an ordinary white polyethylene film 0 008 mm thick and the width of the film was 60 cm and one film covered two rows of maize in 2013 and 2014 as specified by the experimental treatment irrigation began when the soil moisture content was lower than 70 75 of the field holding capacity and stopped when the field holding capacity was reached in 2016 four irrigation treatments were set up in the experiment according to the etc the irrigation volume was controlled to 0 70 85 and 100 etc throughout the whole growth period two mulched and nonmulched factors were set for each irrigation volume treatment with 3 repetitions for each treatment each treatment plot area was 40 6 m and the plots were arranged randomly the specific arrangement of each treatment in 3 years is shown in table 1 in the experiment the soil moisture content of the 0 20 cm 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm soil layers was measured every 7 10 days for irrigation management using gravimetric method and the soil moisture balance was calculated wang et al 2018 in the annual maize growth period various plant measurements were taken including maize phenology leaf area index lai biomass measured only in 2016 and yield in 2016 the micro evaporator was used to monitor the soil evaporation e during the growth period of maize with m w0 nm w0 m w3 and nm w3 treatments and the corresponding crop transpiration tr was calculated according to etc 2 3 weather and irrigation situation the rainfall and irrigation that occurred during the full irrigation treatment during the maize growth period in each year are shown in fig 1 the total rainfall and irrigation in the growth period in 2013 2014 and 2016 were 413 448 and 493 mm respectively the accumulated rainfall during each of the three years was 225 228 and 303 mm respectively from the rainfall distribution shown in fig 1 it can be seen that there was no obvious pattern of rainfall in the three years irrigation in each year was mainly based on the soil water consumption the number of irrigation events was 7 10 and the total amount of irrigation was 188 220 mm the rainfall in 2013 and 2014 was basically the same but the amount of irrigation was quite different and the rainfall in 2016 was relatively large rainfall was concentrated in the later growth stages irrigation mainly supplemented the lack of water that occurred during the early growth stages fig 1 also shows the minimum temperature tmin and maximum temperature tmax from mid april to mid october for each of three years it can be seen that the minimum temperature at the beginning of may and the end of september were below 0 which was due to the frequent late spring cold and frost occurring in this area this seriously affects the growth and final yield of crops and mulching is an effective means to solve this problem the average maximum temperatures during the three year maize growth period were 27 5 26 6 and 27 2 c and the average minimum temperatures were 12 6 11 5 and 12 8 c respectively the three year temperature difference was not significant and the temperature in 2014 was lower 2 4 aquacrop model description the aquacrop model consists of four submodules 1 the climate module which includes maximum and minimum temperature rainfall reference crop water demand et0 and co2 concentration 2 the crop module which includes crop growth development senescence and production processes 3 the management module which includes irrigation and field management measures fertilization mulching field surface practice and weed management and 4 the soil module which includes soil profile characteristics and groundwater conditions the model simulates the four main processes of crop development crop transpiration aboveground biomass and yield sequentially with daily time steps the model uses green canopy cover cc to simulate crop growth development and senescence estimates etc based on cc uses the estimated evapotranspiration to simulate the formation of aboveground biomass and is converted into yield using the harvest index hi steduto et al 2009 the climate data required by the aquacrop model include tmin tmax et0 and precipitation where et0 is calculated according to the penman monteith equation proposed by the fao 56 the weather data in this study were measured using the et107 automatic weather station campbell usa installed in the experimental park the model describes the canopy development process using the cc curve which can be parameterized by using the measured lai value using the equation developed by hsiao et al 2009 1 c c 1 005 1 exp 0 6 lai 1 2 the model decomposes etc into two parts transpiration tr and evaporation e establishes a functional relationship between cc and et0 through transpiration or evaporation coefficients and uses the calculated tr combined with the standard crop water productivity wp to estimate the aboveground biomass b and converts b into the final yield y using the harvest index value with the following formula 2 t r c c k c tr x e t 0 3 e k r 1 c c k ex e t 0 4 b w p t r e t 0 5 y f h i h i 0 b where cc is the actual canopy cover adjusted by the micro advection effect kctr x is the maximum standard crop transpiration coefficient kr is the evaporation reduction coefficient used to adjust the effect of insufficient surface water kex is the maximum soil evaporation coefficient f hi is the regulating factor of water stress and hi0 is the reference harvest index the soil water balance is simulated by tracking the water input rainfall irrigation and capillary water rise and output surface runoff etc and deep seepage at the boundary of the root zone water stress mainly affects crop leaf and canopy growth stomata opening and transpiration canopy senescence and harvest index and the water stress coefficient ks is used to reflect their sensitivity to water stress the aquacrop model can choose the irrigation methods and set the irrigation time and water volume the field management file in the model includes the film module which simulates the film conditions by selecting different film materials and coverage the model also considers the effects of temperature soil fertility and salt stress on crops as well as the effects of field surface properties and weed management on soil moisture raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 and hsiao et al 2009 detailed the concepts principles and assumptions of these simulations 2 5 aquacrop parameters and calibration when applying the model it is necessary to input parameters in climate crop soil and management files these parameters can be divided into two categories 1 conservative parameters which are the parameters used as default values in the model that do not change with time management method or location 2 nonconservative parameters which are the parameters provided by the user and vary with year location or different crop varieties when users use the model for the first time they need to calibrate the conservative parameters of the model to obtain accurate simulation results of specific crop varieties in the region of interest in this study the model was first calibrated using the field observation data from the 2016 water stress test because katerji et al 2013 suggested that the model validation should be carried out under different water stress the model can be run in either growing degree day gdd or calendar day mode and the gdd option was used in the process of parameter calibration the selection of the crop phenological period is key to accurately evaluating crop development the initial estimation of the growth stage was based on field observations and further fine tuning to accurately simulate canopy development the trial and error method was used to iteratively quantify the cc curve parameters until the simulated value resembles the fitted value second the parameters affecting soil moisture dynamics were corrected and the biomass and yield were corrected by adjusting the water productivity and crop transpiration coefficients finally the final yield simulation was fine tuned by adjusting the harvest index to match the actual output under water stress treatment conditions rainfed or restricted irrigation the stress factors affecting canopy expansion stomatal closure and crop senescence were adjusted to fit the simulated value to the observed value since there was no salinity issue at the test site crop responses to salinity and fertility stresses were not considered during the process of calibrating the optimal growth conditions in this study there were two management modes mulched and nonmulched the phenological period of the mulched treatment was significantly shorter than that of the nonmulched treatment especially the emergence time due to the heat preservation effect of mulching on the field experiment when calibrating the model it was found that the maize growth simulation parameters in the two modes were also slightly different when the calibrated conservative parameters of the nonmulched treatment were used to simulate the maize growth of the mulched treatment the simulated biomass and yield values were relatively small which reduced the simulation effect of the model therefore this study calibrated a set of conservative parameters for the mulched and nonmulched treatments table 2 comparing the simulation effects of the mulched treatments with the two sets of parameters it can be seen from table 3 that the recalibrated parameters were used to simulate the mulched treatment which greatly improved the simulation accuracy of cc biomass and yield 2 6 model validation the calibrated model is used to simulate cc soil moisture biomass and harvest yield the model was validated using field observation data during the growth period in 2013 and 2014 to assess the goodness of fit of the model both qualitative and quantitative methods were used the qualitative methods include graphical interpretation of results through a basic understanding of plant processes and field observations to evaluate and understand trends in the data the quantitative method consists of statistical indicators such as simulation error or percent deviation pe root mean square error rmse normalized root mean square error nrmse nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient ef and coefficient of determination r2 the pe is used to evaluate the deviation of the observed and simulated yield relative to the observed value with pe approaching zero indicating better model performance and is calculated as 6 p e s i o i o i 100 7 r m s e i 1 n s i o i 2 n 8 n r m s e r m s e o 100 9 e f 1 i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where oi is the field measured observed value and si represents simulated value o is the mean of the measured values 3 results 3 1 canopy cover the aquacrop model mainly utilizes the dynamic simulation of cc to represent the growth process of crops the accurate simulation of the cc curve is essential for simulating accurately the soil evaporation crop transpiration biomass and yield by the model in the study the model was calibrated using the 2016 test data and verified using the 2013 and 2014 data to determine the development of the leaves and simulate the cc curve the measured and simulated cc for all treatments in each year are presented in figs 2 and 3 the goodness of fit indicators for the cc curve using the model are shown in table 4 in 2016 except for the rainfed treatment the growth of cc across other treatments was similar and the measured values were all near the simulation curve with high r2 0 99 and ef 0 89 values and low rmse 9 and rmses 11 2 values indicating that the calibrated model could better simulate this seasonal trend in general the simulation of the full irrigation treatment w3 was better than those of other water stress treatments w2 w1 and w0 and the simulation of the mild w2 and moderate water stress treatments w1 was similar to that of the full irrigation treatment however it can be seen from fig 2 d and h that the cc simulation curve is significantly lower than the measured value the cc curve shows a sharp decline during the 60 80 dap period under the severe water stress treatment rainfed treatment the higher rmse 15 8 and 25 6 and nrmse 21 4 and 33 2 and lower ef 0 78 and 0 18 in table 4 also indicate poor model performance comparing the mulched and nonmulched treatments the rmse value of each nonmulched treatments was smaller and the ef value was larger indicating that the nonmulched treatment model had a better effect on the cc simulation it can be seen from fig 3 that the model had a good simulation ability in 2014 and could accurately simulate the developing trends of cc but the simulation ability was poor in 2013 in the late maize growth period the simulated cc showed premature aging and the value was seriously underestimated it can be seen from table 4 that except the poor simulation effect of the mulched treatment in 2013 rmse 15 2 nrmse 21 1 ef 0 84 and r2 0 87 the simulation effects of the other treatments were relatively ideal rmse 8 3 nrmse 11 7 ef 0 9 and r2 0 98 when compared the mulched and nonmulched treatments it was obvious that the simulation effect of the nonmulched treatment in 2013 was better than that of the mulched treatment in contrast the cc simulation effect of the mulched treatment in 2014 was better than that of the nonmulched treatment 3 2 total soil water aquacrop is a water driven model and it is important to evaluate the simulation ability of the total soil water tsw the tsw calculated using the actual soil moisture content was compared with the simulated value figs 4 and 5 while table 4 shows the performance statistics of the model for tsw the trend of the simulated and observed tsw values of each treatments was basically the same but the values were quite different in 2016 the rmse range of tsw was 12 8 33 8 mm the nrmse range was 11 24 1 ef 0 67 r2 0 96 for most treatments the tsw had a poor effect on the simulation capability contrary to the cc simulation situation among the irrigation treatments the lower rmse 14 4 and 12 8 mm and higher ef 0 56 and 0 67 values of the rainfed treatment indicate that the simulation effect of the tsw under rainfed conditions was better there was a general trend of overestimating the tsw simulation values in the early stages of the growth period but the simulated values gradually decreased with time and the simulated values were all underestimated in the later stages of growth fig 4 for the nonmulched treatments the differences between the simulated and measured value gradually increased in the late growth period as the irrigation volume decreased for the mulched treatments the simulation effect of most treatments was worse than that of the nonmulched treatments and the simulated value of each treatments appeared to be underestimated in the mid growth stage the larger rmse 26 1 33 8 mm and lower ef 1 46 4 19 values also indicate that the model had a poor simulation effect on the tsw of each irrigation treatment under the mulching condition the simulation effect of the model on tsw was decreased in the verification period as shown in fig 5 the model underestimated the tsw content in the middle and late stages of growth the lower r2 0 72 and ef 4 19 values and the larger rmse 31 mm and nrmse 22 values indicate that the model had a poor simulation for tsw during the verification period especially in 2014 the measured value was significantly different from the simulated value with rmse of 60 7 and 49 mm for nonmulched and mulched treatment similar to the calibration year the simulation of mulched treatment in 2013 was poor but better than that of the nonmulched treatment in 2014 3 3 aboveground biomass the simulation of the aboveground biomass at the standard period was analyzed as the aboveground biomass of maize at each growth period was only observed in 2016 in the three year experiment the model could adequately simulate the growth trend of the aboveground biomass in each treatments but the simulated value of most treatments was slightly higher in the early stages of maize growth than in the middle stages fig 6 by comparing the various irrigation treatments the final aboveground biomass simulation of the full irrigation and mild water stress treatments was better but the simulation value of the moderate water stress treatment was higher fig 6 c and g and the simulation value of the rainfed treatment was lower fig 6 d and h as shown in table 5 the simulation effect on the aboveground biomass was better for all treatments in 2016 r2 0 99 0 9 rmse 2 t ha 5 9 nrmse 15 0 95 ef 0 99 compared with the nonmulched treatment the simulation accuracy of the mulched treatment was reduced in most cases but the simulation effect was better under the severe water stress rainfed treatment 3 4 etc and yield a comparison between the observed and simulated values of total etc during the growth period of maize across the 3 years is shown in table 6 the simulated value of etc was higher than the measured value and the pe of each treatments was large 13 6 pe 27 7 the total r2 of the three year simulated value was 0 81 the rmse was 78 1 mm the nrmse was 20 7 and the ef was 8 34 also indicating that the simulation effect on etc was not ideal compared the treatments applied in 2016 the simulation of the full irrigation treatment pe 20 was better than that of the water stress treatments and the simulation effect of the rainfed treatment was the worst among which the pe of the mulched treatment was as high as 27 7 in addition to the rainfed treatment the pe of the mulched treatments was smaller than that of the nonmulched treatments the pe of etc in 2013 was smaller than that in 2014 in 2013 the simulation effect of etc for nonmulched maize was better than that for mulched maize on the contrary the modeling performance of etc was better for the mulched treatment in 2014 to explain the reason of the poor etc simulation the measured and simulated values of e and tr for each treatments were compared table 7 the simulated value of e was generally lower than the measured value while the simulated value of tr was higher than the measured value moreover the high estimate value of tr was greater than the lowest estimate of e resulting in the overestimation of etc the simulated and measured grain yields in each year are shown in table 6 the model had a good simulation effect on the yield in 2016 the pe of each treatments was relatively small 12 1 to 6 4 and the overall r2 rmse nrmse and ef values were 0 82 0 7 t ha 5 7 and 0 8 respectively the pe of the nonmulched treatments was smaller than that of the mulched treatments and the yield of most of the nonmulched treatments was overestimated while that of the mulched treatments was the opposite the pe between the simulated and measured value of the yield in 2013 exceeds 26 and the model seriously underestimated the maize yield the simulation improved in 2014 but the pe value was greater than 20 and the maize production was overestimated comparing the two year data it could also be found that the simulation results of the nonmulched treatment were better 4 discussion in general excluding the rainfed treatment the model had a better ability to simulate cc among the indicators r2 0 87 and ef 0 84 were relatively high while rmse 15 2 and nrmse 21 1 were relatively low for the rainfed treatments the simulation of cc was poor indicating that the model could not sufficiently simulate the growth of cc under severe water stress conditions the main reason was that the model accelerated canopy senescence under water stress which the senescence occurred in simulated cc but the growth rate slowed down in measured cc when water stress occurred in a short period the research of heng et al 2009 also obtained the same result they noted out that the model could simulate the irrigation treatment of cc well 5 rmse 16 0 8 ef 0 98 but could not simulate cc well under severe water stress conditions where rmse and ef are 34 5 and 2 respectively in the study of irrigating water deficient maize under three different environmental conditions in texas florida and spain sandhu and irmak 2019b also noted the limitations of the model in simulating cc under severe water stress conditions they indicated that the inhibitory effect of water stress calculated by the model was higher than that of the actual setting which led to the underestimation of the simulated cc value in this study the model can adequately simulate cc growth in most cases of mulched treatment the simulation results in 2013 and 2016 were slightly worse than those of the nonmulched treatment but the simulation effect in 2014 was better similarly guo et al 2018 also found that the simulation of cc under a mulched treatment was better than that without mulching in 2017 but similar conclusions were not obtained in other years however tan et al 2018 believed that the model could well simulate the cc growth of cotton under drip irrigation with film mulching in xinjiang china r2 0 86 rmse 16 7 liu et al 2017 also found that the accuracy of the model in simulating cc under film mulching was higher than that without film mulching the simulation effect of most treatments on tsw was unsatisfactory r2 was 0 09 0 96 ef was 12 97 to 0 67 rmse was 12 8 60 7 mm nrmse was 11 37 7 one of the reasons is the model uses the wetted soil surface to distinguish different irrigation methods raes et al 2009 which makes it difficult to simulate the complex water movements under drip irrigation and the real water content of each soil layer is simulated difficultly when irrigation occurs this can also explain why the simulation effect of the tsw was better under rainfed conditions the model is more accurate when simulating soil moisture movements caused by rainfall in the absence of irrigation another reason is that the model overestimated the etc and the pe of each treatment exceeded 13 6 this is similar to what nyakudya and stroosnijder 2014 found that the model overestimated tsw with rmses of 11 5 mm and 17 2 mm and efs of 0 78 and 0 04 respectively they hypothesized that the main reason for the poor simulation effect of tsw is the poor simulation effect of the model on etc 13 6 pe 27 7 rmse is 78 1 mm ef is 8 34 compared the values of the four treatments in 2016 the model underestimated e and overestimated tr and large overestimation of tr and the minor underestimation of e led to the overestimation of etc which can also explain the overestimated trend of the tsw simulation in the early stages but the underestimated in the late stages of maize the reason for tr overestimation is that the simulation of tr is closely related to the cc curve and kc transpiration coefficient seen from eq 2 and the accuracy of kc value was difficult to determine besides relating to the cc curve and kc the model simulates e by multiplying the adjustment coefficient for both localized irrigation and mulched raes et al 2009 which is easy to lead to an inaccurate simulation of e paredes et al 2014 also believed that model overestimated crop transpiration and underestimated evaporation values although they get a better simulation of the seasonal etc with rmse of 5 7 mm sandhu and irmak 2019a also found that the model had a poor simulation effect on the available soil water content asw 23 rmse 87 mm 2 67 ef 0 88 and etc rmse is 31 mm and ef is 1 93 when simulating maize growth under subsurface drip irrigation and that the asw of most treatments was underestimated they also noted that an inaccurate division of the transpiration and evaporation components in the model led to poor simulations of tsw and etc and encouraged the re evaluation of the model related variables using the measured evapotranspiration data sandhu and irmak 2019b due to the poor simulation effects of tsw and etc the simulation effects of the mulched and nonmulched treatments did not show obvious trends and the simulation results were different in each year we may need to ensure the simulation accuracy under nonmulched drip irrigation then find out the real impact of mulched on the tsw and etc similarly guo et al 2018 also obtained poor simulation results for swc 14 7 rmse 39 7 mm 0 93 ef 0 8 and etc 17 1 pe 9 7 and could not obtain better results from the mulched and nonmulched treatments by comparing the simulation performances of swc and etc between the two treatments in all of the test years the simulation performance of aboveground biomass in 2016 was satisfactory the r2 and ef 0 95 0 99 values were high and the rmse 0 9 2 t ha and nrmse 5 9 15 were small similarly hsiao et al 2009 reported that the simulation performance for biomass growth was better in the model and the rmse under all treatments ranged from 0 58 to 6 18 t ha sandhu and irmak 2019b also obtained higher r2 0 9 and ef 0 84 and lower rmse 1 3 2 8 t ha values for biomass and stated that the overestimation of biomass increased with increasing water stress our research differed from theirs in that the simulation of aboveground biomass under moderate water stress treatment showed a smaller degree of overestimation in the middle and late stages but the simulated value under the rainfed treatment was lower in this study the main reason was that the model underestimated the tsw content leading to the senescence of cc and simulated aboveground biomass decreased because of the lower simulated cc in most cases the simulation effect of the mulched treatment was worse than that of the nonmulched treatment because the model only considers the effect of mulching on soil evaporation the positive effect of mulching on soil temperature and crop growth zhang et al 2017 is not considered and the actual aboveground biomass cannot be simply simulated using crop water productivity guo et al 2018 also concluded that the simulation performance of the aboveground biomass was better under nonmulched than under mulched treatment with no water stress the total rmse of the grain yield in this study was 2 t ha which was between the reported value of rmse 1 7 and 3 5 t ha simulated by paredes et al 2014 for grain yield in the mediterranean region and similar to that of the rmse values 1 7 and 2 2 t ha under iran s semiarid climate obtained by ahmadi et al 2015 the simulation effect of the model was good in the calibration year but the simulation effect of the model decreases in the verification year in 2013 the model underestimated the simulated yield and the absolute value of the simulation deviation exceeded 26 the premature aging of the simulated cc occurred because the simulated value of tsw in the middle was too low which led to a decrease in the simulated cc value and slowed the rate of biomass accumulation caused the simulated biomass and yield to be lower than the measured values in contrast the model overestimated the yield with a deviation of more than 20 in 2014 the main reason is that a serious reduction in maize production occurred in this year due to the frost present at the end of september see fig 1 although the model considers the effects of low temperature stresses on crop growth the effect of frost on crops is insufficiently simulated because it only simulates the effect of low temperatures on transpiration and fertilization through the stress coefficient raes et al 2009 geerts et al 2009 also noted that the model did not simulate extreme weather conditions well such as frost the simulation effect of yield under mulched treatment was worse than that under nonmulched the simulation of the full irrigation treatment with a plastic film overestimated the final yield while other treatments underestimated the yield the main reason is that the maize yield increase resulting from the plastic film under certain water stresses was not simulated by the model the yield increased significantly under mild water stress with mulching which was caused by the multiple influences of film mulching on the hydrothermal environment which were not considered in the model this also indicated that it is insufficient for simulating under mulched by simply changing evaporation because it can improve the soil hydrothermal environment and promote crop growth xiukang et al 2015 in order to improve the simulation accuracy under mulched it is suggested to add a factor to represent the promotion effect for crop growth in the simulation under mulched guo et al 2018 noted that the model was able to simulate millet yield under mulching conditions but relative to the nonmulched treatment the model underestimates millet yield under the mulched treatment more obviously tan et al 2018 found that when simulating the yield of corn under mulching more than 30 of all treatments had a simulation error of more than 30 5 conclusions the aquacrop model was calibrated and verified using 3 years of experimental data in the semiarid continental monsoon climate zone of northeast china with and without the plastic film for drip irrigation maize the simulations of cc tsw aboveground biomass etc and final yield under different water stress with and without mulching were compared with the measured data the results showed that the aquacrop model could well simulate cc excluding the rainfed treatment aboveground biomass and yield for maize under the drip irrigation in normal years but the simulation accuracy of tsw and etc needed to be improved secondly the simulation effect of the model was better under nonmulched than under the mulched treatment in general tsw and etc are the basis of soil water balance and the premise of accurate simulation of the model therefore soil water simulation may need to be improved to determine the corresponding soil water quantity according to the characteristics of partially moist soil under drip irrigation besides the simulation of evapotranspiration and the mulch module may need some modification such as determining the accuracy of the kc value and adding a factor to represent the promotion effect under mulched if these improvements can be made the model will become a useful tool for crop growth management and optimizing irrigation plans in the region declaration of competing interest

9747,establishing scientific management and grain production strategies through crop models is an important means to ensure stable and increased food production to explore the performance of the aquacrop model for simulating maize growth under mulched drip irrigation in northeast china the model was calibrated and verified locally based on three years of measured field data the simulation effects of canopy cover cc total soil water tsw aboveground biomass crop evapotranspiration etc and grain yield under mulched or nonmulched drip irrigation treatments with different water stress conditions were evaluated and compared the study found the model had a good simulation effect on cc excluding the rainfed treatment the root mean square error rmse was 15 2 the simulated values of tsw and etc were quite different from those observed in the field the tsw content was generally underestimated in the middle and late stages of maize growth with rmse values ranging from 12 8 to 60 7 mm the simulated etc values were generally high and the prediction error of some treatments exceeded 20 the model simulated the aboveground biomass and yield well in the calibration year 2016 and the rmse values were 0 9 2 t ha and 0 8 t ha respectively but the simulation performance of predicting yield declined in the verification year and the prediction error exceeded 20 compared with the mulched treatments the model had a better simulation effect on the nonmulched treatments in general the simulation of soil moisture under drip irrigation needs to be improved and the larger overestimation of transpiration and the lower underestimation of evaporation caused to overestimate the maize etc it is recommended to improve the simulation of mulched drip irrigation to ensure model applicability in the region of interest keywords aquacrop mulched drip irrigation canopy cover total soil water biomass evapotranspiration 1 introduction food is the foundation for ensuring global stability and social progress it is important to ensure food security through increasing food production facing the rapid growth of the global population eckardt and cominelli 2009 maize plays an important role as a food crop accounting for nearly 30 of the world s total grain production fao 2019 in particular northeast china is the main maize production area and an important commercial grain base in china mo et al 2017 and its maize output accounts for approximately 40 of the national maize output however maize yield is limited by low and unevenly distributed rainfall low temperature and cold triggered damages in the mid temperate and semiarid regions of northeast china wang et al 2017 mulched drip irrigation technology combines the advantages of surface drip irrigation and film mulching technology which can improve the efficiency of water and fertilizer utilization improve the hydrothermal environment of a field and promote crop growth and yield increases li et al 2017 spehia et al 2013 wang et al 2018 after over 20 years of development mulched drip irrigation technology has been widely promoted in arid and semiarid areas in northwest china it is not only applied to crops with high economic value such as fruits vegetables and flowers but also has made remarkable progress on some field crops such as cotton tomato and potato wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 2017 in recent years mulched drip irrigation has been gradually increasingly used in northeast china to reduce the impact of low ground temperature and insufficient accumulated temperature sui et al 2018 wang et al 2021 crop growth models are dynamic simulations of the processes of crop growth and yield formation and crop response to environmental changes in the crop soil atmosphere system by means of computer technology and mathematical models sandhu and irmak 2019b as a result of long term research many crop models have been developed according to different crops and driving principles such as crop syst stöckle et al 2003 epic ko et al 2009 dssat jones et al 2003 wofost de wit et al 2019 and apsim keating et al 2003 the simulation of crop development and growth parameters is based on the complex interactions between climate variables crops soil parameters and management practices most models require very detailed input data and information about crop growth and some are not available for application in certain locations the aquacrop model raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 developed by the food and agriculture organization fao has a simple and user friendly interface and it is designed to balance simplicity accuracy and stability compared with other crop models the aquacrop model includes the most intuitive parameters used to simulate crop yield under different management conditions in addition the open source version of aquacrop aquacrop os can also be run in multiple programming languages and operating systems foster et al 2017 the performance of the model has been evaluated for most crops including maize ahmadi et al 2015 heng et al 2009 cotton farahani et al 2009 rice maniruzzaman et al 2015 soybean paredes et al 2015 wheat andarzian et al 2011 barley araya et al 2010 potato razzaghi et al 2017 and sunflower stricevic et al 2011 on the other hand a large number of studies have been carried out using the model after preliminary verification such as determining the best sowing date raja et al 2018 and optimizing farmland water and fertilizer management shrestha et al 2013 making decisions to future climate change deb et al 2015 and managing irrigation coupled with economic models garcía vila and fereres 2012 although many research results show that the aquacrop model performs well in simulating canopy coverage biomass yield and harvest index araya et al 2010 geerts et al 2009 greaves and wang 2016 there are also some studies that raise the question of the model heng et al 2009 verified the model using data from different locations in subsequent research and found that the model had a good ability to simulate the canopy cover aboveground biomass and yield but this effect was reduced under severe water stress katerji et al 2013 highlighted the performance of aquacrop model in simulating on maize and tomato yield biomass and etc under water stress they reported that the model overestimated the crop yield and underestimated the water consumption and the model performance vary caused by the different levels of water stress paredes et al 2015 found that the model had some serious limitations in estimating crop transpiration and soil evaporation in simulating soybean growth in north china and believed the reason was the method of calculating et used in the model sandhu and irmak 2019b evaluated the model using 6 years of measured data of subsurface drip irrigation in nebraska usa and concluded that the aquacrop model could accurately simulate the cc and yield in most cases but encountered great difficulties in simulating the soil moisture and biomass in addition the model has few studies on the simulation effect of mulching guo et al 2018 ran et al 2017 and most of the studies are mainly focused on non irrigation or surface irrigation while few on drip irrigation in conclusion although the aquacrop model has been widely used in the simulation of various crop growth in different climate types and farmland management conditions the simulation effect of the model fluctuates due to differences in climate location irrigation strategy and management measures therefore this study aims to evaluate the simulation effect of the aquacrop model on the growth of maize under drip irrigation mulched and nonmulched and determine the effectiveness and limitations of the model in practical applications to make the model can be used in agricultural production and management in the northeast china 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the data of this study mainly came from previous research on maize planting pattern under mulched drip irrigation in chifeng city 42 57 n 119 19 e at an elevation of 625 m above mean sea level inner mongolia china the area has a semiarid and continental monsoon climate the multiyear average temperature is 11 c the accumulated temperature above 10 c is 2900 c the frost free period is 135 d and the annual average rainfall is 343 mm and the annual evaporation is 2138 8 mm the soil texture of the 0 40 cm depth interval of the test site is sandy the soil below 40 cm is classified as a loam the average soil dry bulk density of the upper 1 m is 1 52 g cm 3 the average field water holding rate is 30 01 volume water content and the groundwater depth is 20 30 m 2 2 field management in this study we selected relevant field test data in 2013 2014 and 2016 for analysis in the experiment the maize variety of focus was xianyu 335 and the planting pattern adopted a wide and narrow row pattern with large ridges and double rows the wider row was 80 cm the narrower row was 40 cm the maize plant spacing was 20 cm and the planting density was 83 333 plants hm 2 drip irrigation belts were laid between the narrow rows of maize one tube controlled two rows of maize and the distance between the drip irrigation belts was 1 2 m in addition the agricultural film was an ordinary white polyethylene film 0 008 mm thick and the width of the film was 60 cm and one film covered two rows of maize in 2013 and 2014 as specified by the experimental treatment irrigation began when the soil moisture content was lower than 70 75 of the field holding capacity and stopped when the field holding capacity was reached in 2016 four irrigation treatments were set up in the experiment according to the etc the irrigation volume was controlled to 0 70 85 and 100 etc throughout the whole growth period two mulched and nonmulched factors were set for each irrigation volume treatment with 3 repetitions for each treatment each treatment plot area was 40 6 m and the plots were arranged randomly the specific arrangement of each treatment in 3 years is shown in table 1 in the experiment the soil moisture content of the 0 20 cm 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm soil layers was measured every 7 10 days for irrigation management using gravimetric method and the soil moisture balance was calculated wang et al 2018 in the annual maize growth period various plant measurements were taken including maize phenology leaf area index lai biomass measured only in 2016 and yield in 2016 the micro evaporator was used to monitor the soil evaporation e during the growth period of maize with m w0 nm w0 m w3 and nm w3 treatments and the corresponding crop transpiration tr was calculated according to etc 2 3 weather and irrigation situation the rainfall and irrigation that occurred during the full irrigation treatment during the maize growth period in each year are shown in fig 1 the total rainfall and irrigation in the growth period in 2013 2014 and 2016 were 413 448 and 493 mm respectively the accumulated rainfall during each of the three years was 225 228 and 303 mm respectively from the rainfall distribution shown in fig 1 it can be seen that there was no obvious pattern of rainfall in the three years irrigation in each year was mainly based on the soil water consumption the number of irrigation events was 7 10 and the total amount of irrigation was 188 220 mm the rainfall in 2013 and 2014 was basically the same but the amount of irrigation was quite different and the rainfall in 2016 was relatively large rainfall was concentrated in the later growth stages irrigation mainly supplemented the lack of water that occurred during the early growth stages fig 1 also shows the minimum temperature tmin and maximum temperature tmax from mid april to mid october for each of three years it can be seen that the minimum temperature at the beginning of may and the end of september were below 0 which was due to the frequent late spring cold and frost occurring in this area this seriously affects the growth and final yield of crops and mulching is an effective means to solve this problem the average maximum temperatures during the three year maize growth period were 27 5 26 6 and 27 2 c and the average minimum temperatures were 12 6 11 5 and 12 8 c respectively the three year temperature difference was not significant and the temperature in 2014 was lower 2 4 aquacrop model description the aquacrop model consists of four submodules 1 the climate module which includes maximum and minimum temperature rainfall reference crop water demand et0 and co2 concentration 2 the crop module which includes crop growth development senescence and production processes 3 the management module which includes irrigation and field management measures fertilization mulching field surface practice and weed management and 4 the soil module which includes soil profile characteristics and groundwater conditions the model simulates the four main processes of crop development crop transpiration aboveground biomass and yield sequentially with daily time steps the model uses green canopy cover cc to simulate crop growth development and senescence estimates etc based on cc uses the estimated evapotranspiration to simulate the formation of aboveground biomass and is converted into yield using the harvest index hi steduto et al 2009 the climate data required by the aquacrop model include tmin tmax et0 and precipitation where et0 is calculated according to the penman monteith equation proposed by the fao 56 the weather data in this study were measured using the et107 automatic weather station campbell usa installed in the experimental park the model describes the canopy development process using the cc curve which can be parameterized by using the measured lai value using the equation developed by hsiao et al 2009 1 c c 1 005 1 exp 0 6 lai 1 2 the model decomposes etc into two parts transpiration tr and evaporation e establishes a functional relationship between cc and et0 through transpiration or evaporation coefficients and uses the calculated tr combined with the standard crop water productivity wp to estimate the aboveground biomass b and converts b into the final yield y using the harvest index value with the following formula 2 t r c c k c tr x e t 0 3 e k r 1 c c k ex e t 0 4 b w p t r e t 0 5 y f h i h i 0 b where cc is the actual canopy cover adjusted by the micro advection effect kctr x is the maximum standard crop transpiration coefficient kr is the evaporation reduction coefficient used to adjust the effect of insufficient surface water kex is the maximum soil evaporation coefficient f hi is the regulating factor of water stress and hi0 is the reference harvest index the soil water balance is simulated by tracking the water input rainfall irrigation and capillary water rise and output surface runoff etc and deep seepage at the boundary of the root zone water stress mainly affects crop leaf and canopy growth stomata opening and transpiration canopy senescence and harvest index and the water stress coefficient ks is used to reflect their sensitivity to water stress the aquacrop model can choose the irrigation methods and set the irrigation time and water volume the field management file in the model includes the film module which simulates the film conditions by selecting different film materials and coverage the model also considers the effects of temperature soil fertility and salt stress on crops as well as the effects of field surface properties and weed management on soil moisture raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 and hsiao et al 2009 detailed the concepts principles and assumptions of these simulations 2 5 aquacrop parameters and calibration when applying the model it is necessary to input parameters in climate crop soil and management files these parameters can be divided into two categories 1 conservative parameters which are the parameters used as default values in the model that do not change with time management method or location 2 nonconservative parameters which are the parameters provided by the user and vary with year location or different crop varieties when users use the model for the first time they need to calibrate the conservative parameters of the model to obtain accurate simulation results of specific crop varieties in the region of interest in this study the model was first calibrated using the field observation data from the 2016 water stress test because katerji et al 2013 suggested that the model validation should be carried out under different water stress the model can be run in either growing degree day gdd or calendar day mode and the gdd option was used in the process of parameter calibration the selection of the crop phenological period is key to accurately evaluating crop development the initial estimation of the growth stage was based on field observations and further fine tuning to accurately simulate canopy development the trial and error method was used to iteratively quantify the cc curve parameters until the simulated value resembles the fitted value second the parameters affecting soil moisture dynamics were corrected and the biomass and yield were corrected by adjusting the water productivity and crop transpiration coefficients finally the final yield simulation was fine tuned by adjusting the harvest index to match the actual output under water stress treatment conditions rainfed or restricted irrigation the stress factors affecting canopy expansion stomatal closure and crop senescence were adjusted to fit the simulated value to the observed value since there was no salinity issue at the test site crop responses to salinity and fertility stresses were not considered during the process of calibrating the optimal growth conditions in this study there were two management modes mulched and nonmulched the phenological period of the mulched treatment was significantly shorter than that of the nonmulched treatment especially the emergence time due to the heat preservation effect of mulching on the field experiment when calibrating the model it was found that the maize growth simulation parameters in the two modes were also slightly different when the calibrated conservative parameters of the nonmulched treatment were used to simulate the maize growth of the mulched treatment the simulated biomass and yield values were relatively small which reduced the simulation effect of the model therefore this study calibrated a set of conservative parameters for the mulched and nonmulched treatments table 2 comparing the simulation effects of the mulched treatments with the two sets of parameters it can be seen from table 3 that the recalibrated parameters were used to simulate the mulched treatment which greatly improved the simulation accuracy of cc biomass and yield 2 6 model validation the calibrated model is used to simulate cc soil moisture biomass and harvest yield the model was validated using field observation data during the growth period in 2013 and 2014 to assess the goodness of fit of the model both qualitative and quantitative methods were used the qualitative methods include graphical interpretation of results through a basic understanding of plant processes and field observations to evaluate and understand trends in the data the quantitative method consists of statistical indicators such as simulation error or percent deviation pe root mean square error rmse normalized root mean square error nrmse nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient ef and coefficient of determination r2 the pe is used to evaluate the deviation of the observed and simulated yield relative to the observed value with pe approaching zero indicating better model performance and is calculated as 6 p e s i o i o i 100 7 r m s e i 1 n s i o i 2 n 8 n r m s e r m s e o 100 9 e f 1 i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where oi is the field measured observed value and si represents simulated value o is the mean of the measured values 3 results 3 1 canopy cover the aquacrop model mainly utilizes the dynamic simulation of cc to represent the growth process of crops the accurate simulation of the cc curve is essential for simulating accurately the soil evaporation crop transpiration biomass and yield by the model in the study the model was calibrated using the 2016 test data and verified using the 2013 and 2014 data to determine the development of the leaves and simulate the cc curve the measured and simulated cc for all treatments in each year are presented in figs 2 and 3 the goodness of fit indicators for the cc curve using the model are shown in table 4 in 2016 except for the rainfed treatment the growth of cc across other treatments was similar and the measured values were all near the simulation curve with high r2 0 99 and ef 0 89 values and low rmse 9 and rmses 11 2 values indicating that the calibrated model could better simulate this seasonal trend in general the simulation of the full irrigation treatment w3 was better than those of other water stress treatments w2 w1 and w0 and the simulation of the mild w2 and moderate water stress treatments w1 was similar to that of the full irrigation treatment however it can be seen from fig 2 d and h that the cc simulation curve is significantly lower than the measured value the cc curve shows a sharp decline during the 60 80 dap period under the severe water stress treatment rainfed treatment the higher rmse 15 8 and 25 6 and nrmse 21 4 and 33 2 and lower ef 0 78 and 0 18 in table 4 also indicate poor model performance comparing the mulched and nonmulched treatments the rmse value of each nonmulched treatments was smaller and the ef value was larger indicating that the nonmulched treatment model had a better effect on the cc simulation it can be seen from fig 3 that the model had a good simulation ability in 2014 and could accurately simulate the developing trends of cc but the simulation ability was poor in 2013 in the late maize growth period the simulated cc showed premature aging and the value was seriously underestimated it can be seen from table 4 that except the poor simulation effect of the mulched treatment in 2013 rmse 15 2 nrmse 21 1 ef 0 84 and r2 0 87 the simulation effects of the other treatments were relatively ideal rmse 8 3 nrmse 11 7 ef 0 9 and r2 0 98 when compared the mulched and nonmulched treatments it was obvious that the simulation effect of the nonmulched treatment in 2013 was better than that of the mulched treatment in contrast the cc simulation effect of the mulched treatment in 2014 was better than that of the nonmulched treatment 3 2 total soil water aquacrop is a water driven model and it is important to evaluate the simulation ability of the total soil water tsw the tsw calculated using the actual soil moisture content was compared with the simulated value figs 4 and 5 while table 4 shows the performance statistics of the model for tsw the trend of the simulated and observed tsw values of each treatments was basically the same but the values were quite different in 2016 the rmse range of tsw was 12 8 33 8 mm the nrmse range was 11 24 1 ef 0 67 r2 0 96 for most treatments the tsw had a poor effect on the simulation capability contrary to the cc simulation situation among the irrigation treatments the lower rmse 14 4 and 12 8 mm and higher ef 0 56 and 0 67 values of the rainfed treatment indicate that the simulation effect of the tsw under rainfed conditions was better there was a general trend of overestimating the tsw simulation values in the early stages of the growth period but the simulated values gradually decreased with time and the simulated values were all underestimated in the later stages of growth fig 4 for the nonmulched treatments the differences between the simulated and measured value gradually increased in the late growth period as the irrigation volume decreased for the mulched treatments the simulation effect of most treatments was worse than that of the nonmulched treatments and the simulated value of each treatments appeared to be underestimated in the mid growth stage the larger rmse 26 1 33 8 mm and lower ef 1 46 4 19 values also indicate that the model had a poor simulation effect on the tsw of each irrigation treatment under the mulching condition the simulation effect of the model on tsw was decreased in the verification period as shown in fig 5 the model underestimated the tsw content in the middle and late stages of growth the lower r2 0 72 and ef 4 19 values and the larger rmse 31 mm and nrmse 22 values indicate that the model had a poor simulation for tsw during the verification period especially in 2014 the measured value was significantly different from the simulated value with rmse of 60 7 and 49 mm for nonmulched and mulched treatment similar to the calibration year the simulation of mulched treatment in 2013 was poor but better than that of the nonmulched treatment in 2014 3 3 aboveground biomass the simulation of the aboveground biomass at the standard period was analyzed as the aboveground biomass of maize at each growth period was only observed in 2016 in the three year experiment the model could adequately simulate the growth trend of the aboveground biomass in each treatments but the simulated value of most treatments was slightly higher in the early stages of maize growth than in the middle stages fig 6 by comparing the various irrigation treatments the final aboveground biomass simulation of the full irrigation and mild water stress treatments was better but the simulation value of the moderate water stress treatment was higher fig 6 c and g and the simulation value of the rainfed treatment was lower fig 6 d and h as shown in table 5 the simulation effect on the aboveground biomass was better for all treatments in 2016 r2 0 99 0 9 rmse 2 t ha 5 9 nrmse 15 0 95 ef 0 99 compared with the nonmulched treatment the simulation accuracy of the mulched treatment was reduced in most cases but the simulation effect was better under the severe water stress rainfed treatment 3 4 etc and yield a comparison between the observed and simulated values of total etc during the growth period of maize across the 3 years is shown in table 6 the simulated value of etc was higher than the measured value and the pe of each treatments was large 13 6 pe 27 7 the total r2 of the three year simulated value was 0 81 the rmse was 78 1 mm the nrmse was 20 7 and the ef was 8 34 also indicating that the simulation effect on etc was not ideal compared the treatments applied in 2016 the simulation of the full irrigation treatment pe 20 was better than that of the water stress treatments and the simulation effect of the rainfed treatment was the worst among which the pe of the mulched treatment was as high as 27 7 in addition to the rainfed treatment the pe of the mulched treatments was smaller than that of the nonmulched treatments the pe of etc in 2013 was smaller than that in 2014 in 2013 the simulation effect of etc for nonmulched maize was better than that for mulched maize on the contrary the modeling performance of etc was better for the mulched treatment in 2014 to explain the reason of the poor etc simulation the measured and simulated values of e and tr for each treatments were compared table 7 the simulated value of e was generally lower than the measured value while the simulated value of tr was higher than the measured value moreover the high estimate value of tr was greater than the lowest estimate of e resulting in the overestimation of etc the simulated and measured grain yields in each year are shown in table 6 the model had a good simulation effect on the yield in 2016 the pe of each treatments was relatively small 12 1 to 6 4 and the overall r2 rmse nrmse and ef values were 0 82 0 7 t ha 5 7 and 0 8 respectively the pe of the nonmulched treatments was smaller than that of the mulched treatments and the yield of most of the nonmulched treatments was overestimated while that of the mulched treatments was the opposite the pe between the simulated and measured value of the yield in 2013 exceeds 26 and the model seriously underestimated the maize yield the simulation improved in 2014 but the pe value was greater than 20 and the maize production was overestimated comparing the two year data it could also be found that the simulation results of the nonmulched treatment were better 4 discussion in general excluding the rainfed treatment the model had a better ability to simulate cc among the indicators r2 0 87 and ef 0 84 were relatively high while rmse 15 2 and nrmse 21 1 were relatively low for the rainfed treatments the simulation of cc was poor indicating that the model could not sufficiently simulate the growth of cc under severe water stress conditions the main reason was that the model accelerated canopy senescence under water stress which the senescence occurred in simulated cc but the growth rate slowed down in measured cc when water stress occurred in a short period the research of heng et al 2009 also obtained the same result they noted out that the model could simulate the irrigation treatment of cc well 5 rmse 16 0 8 ef 0 98 but could not simulate cc well under severe water stress conditions where rmse and ef are 34 5 and 2 respectively in the study of irrigating water deficient maize under three different environmental conditions in texas florida and spain sandhu and irmak 2019b also noted the limitations of the model in simulating cc under severe water stress conditions they indicated that the inhibitory effect of water stress calculated by the model was higher than that of the actual setting which led to the underestimation of the simulated cc value in this study the model can adequately simulate cc growth in most cases of mulched treatment the simulation results in 2013 and 2016 were slightly worse than those of the nonmulched treatment but the simulation effect in 2014 was better similarly guo et al 2018 also found that the simulation of cc under a mulched treatment was better than that without mulching in 2017 but similar conclusions were not obtained in other years however tan et al 2018 believed that the model could well simulate the cc growth of cotton under drip irrigation with film mulching in xinjiang china r2 0 86 rmse 16 7 liu et al 2017 also found that the accuracy of the model in simulating cc under film mulching was higher than that without film mulching the simulation effect of most treatments on tsw was unsatisfactory r2 was 0 09 0 96 ef was 12 97 to 0 67 rmse was 12 8 60 7 mm nrmse was 11 37 7 one of the reasons is the model uses the wetted soil surface to distinguish different irrigation methods raes et al 2009 which makes it difficult to simulate the complex water movements under drip irrigation and the real water content of each soil layer is simulated difficultly when irrigation occurs this can also explain why the simulation effect of the tsw was better under rainfed conditions the model is more accurate when simulating soil moisture movements caused by rainfall in the absence of irrigation another reason is that the model overestimated the etc and the pe of each treatment exceeded 13 6 this is similar to what nyakudya and stroosnijder 2014 found that the model overestimated tsw with rmses of 11 5 mm and 17 2 mm and efs of 0 78 and 0 04 respectively they hypothesized that the main reason for the poor simulation effect of tsw is the poor simulation effect of the model on etc 13 6 pe 27 7 rmse is 78 1 mm ef is 8 34 compared the values of the four treatments in 2016 the model underestimated e and overestimated tr and large overestimation of tr and the minor underestimation of e led to the overestimation of etc which can also explain the overestimated trend of the tsw simulation in the early stages but the underestimated in the late stages of maize the reason for tr overestimation is that the simulation of tr is closely related to the cc curve and kc transpiration coefficient seen from eq 2 and the accuracy of kc value was difficult to determine besides relating to the cc curve and kc the model simulates e by multiplying the adjustment coefficient for both localized irrigation and mulched raes et al 2009 which is easy to lead to an inaccurate simulation of e paredes et al 2014 also believed that model overestimated crop transpiration and underestimated evaporation values although they get a better simulation of the seasonal etc with rmse of 5 7 mm sandhu and irmak 2019a also found that the model had a poor simulation effect on the available soil water content asw 23 rmse 87 mm 2 67 ef 0 88 and etc rmse is 31 mm and ef is 1 93 when simulating maize growth under subsurface drip irrigation and that the asw of most treatments was underestimated they also noted that an inaccurate division of the transpiration and evaporation components in the model led to poor simulations of tsw and etc and encouraged the re evaluation of the model related variables using the measured evapotranspiration data sandhu and irmak 2019b due to the poor simulation effects of tsw and etc the simulation effects of the mulched and nonmulched treatments did not show obvious trends and the simulation results were different in each year we may need to ensure the simulation accuracy under nonmulched drip irrigation then find out the real impact of mulched on the tsw and etc similarly guo et al 2018 also obtained poor simulation results for swc 14 7 rmse 39 7 mm 0 93 ef 0 8 and etc 17 1 pe 9 7 and could not obtain better results from the mulched and nonmulched treatments by comparing the simulation performances of swc and etc between the two treatments in all of the test years the simulation performance of aboveground biomass in 2016 was satisfactory the r2 and ef 0 95 0 99 values were high and the rmse 0 9 2 t ha and nrmse 5 9 15 were small similarly hsiao et al 2009 reported that the simulation performance for biomass growth was better in the model and the rmse under all treatments ranged from 0 58 to 6 18 t ha sandhu and irmak 2019b also obtained higher r2 0 9 and ef 0 84 and lower rmse 1 3 2 8 t ha values for biomass and stated that the overestimation of biomass increased with increasing water stress our research differed from theirs in that the simulation of aboveground biomass under moderate water stress treatment showed a smaller degree of overestimation in the middle and late stages but the simulated value under the rainfed treatment was lower in this study the main reason was that the model underestimated the tsw content leading to the senescence of cc and simulated aboveground biomass decreased because of the lower simulated cc in most cases the simulation effect of the mulched treatment was worse than that of the nonmulched treatment because the model only considers the effect of mulching on soil evaporation the positive effect of mulching on soil temperature and crop growth zhang et al 2017 is not considered and the actual aboveground biomass cannot be simply simulated using crop water productivity guo et al 2018 also concluded that the simulation performance of the aboveground biomass was better under nonmulched than under mulched treatment with no water stress the total rmse of the grain yield in this study was 2 t ha which was between the reported value of rmse 1 7 and 3 5 t ha simulated by paredes et al 2014 for grain yield in the mediterranean region and similar to that of the rmse values 1 7 and 2 2 t ha under iran s semiarid climate obtained by ahmadi et al 2015 the simulation effect of the model was good in the calibration year but the simulation effect of the model decreases in the verification year in 2013 the model underestimated the simulated yield and the absolute value of the simulation deviation exceeded 26 the premature aging of the simulated cc occurred because the simulated value of tsw in the middle was too low which led to a decrease in the simulated cc value and slowed the rate of biomass accumulation caused the simulated biomass and yield to be lower than the measured values in contrast the model overestimated the yield with a deviation of more than 20 in 2014 the main reason is that a serious reduction in maize production occurred in this year due to the frost present at the end of september see fig 1 although the model considers the effects of low temperature stresses on crop growth the effect of frost on crops is insufficiently simulated because it only simulates the effect of low temperatures on transpiration and fertilization through the stress coefficient raes et al 2009 geerts et al 2009 also noted that the model did not simulate extreme weather conditions well such as frost the simulation effect of yield under mulched treatment was worse than that under nonmulched the simulation of the full irrigation treatment with a plastic film overestimated the final yield while other treatments underestimated the yield the main reason is that the maize yield increase resulting from the plastic film under certain water stresses was not simulated by the model the yield increased significantly under mild water stress with mulching which was caused by the multiple influences of film mulching on the hydrothermal environment which were not considered in the model this also indicated that it is insufficient for simulating under mulched by simply changing evaporation because it can improve the soil hydrothermal environment and promote crop growth xiukang et al 2015 in order to improve the simulation accuracy under mulched it is suggested to add a factor to represent the promotion effect for crop growth in the simulation under mulched guo et al 2018 noted that the model was able to simulate millet yield under mulching conditions but relative to the nonmulched treatment the model underestimates millet yield under the mulched treatment more obviously tan et al 2018 found that when simulating the yield of corn under mulching more than 30 of all treatments had a simulation error of more than 30 5 conclusions the aquacrop model was calibrated and verified using 3 years of experimental data in the semiarid continental monsoon climate zone of northeast china with and without the plastic film for drip irrigation maize the simulations of cc tsw aboveground biomass etc and final yield under different water stress with and without mulching were compared with the measured data the results showed that the aquacrop model could well simulate cc excluding the rainfed treatment aboveground biomass and yield for maize under the drip irrigation in normal years but the simulation accuracy of tsw and etc needed to be improved secondly the simulation effect of the model was better under nonmulched than under the mulched treatment in general tsw and etc are the basis of soil water balance and the premise of accurate simulation of the model therefore soil water simulation may need to be improved to determine the corresponding soil water quantity according to the characteristics of partially moist soil under drip irrigation besides the simulation of evapotranspiration and the mulch module may need some modification such as determining the accuracy of the kc value and adding a factor to represent the promotion effect under mulched if these improvements can be made the model will become a useful tool for crop growth management and optimizing irrigation plans in the region declaration of competing interest

9748,it is imperative to evaluate the practicality of brackish water irrigation for alleviating the conflict between freshwater resources shortages and food production four years experiments were carried out on cotton from 2012 to 2015 seasons with four salinity levels in irrigation water including 1 3 ds m 1 ck 5 4 ds m 1 s1 8 8 ds m 1 s2 and 12 4 ds m 1 s3 in lowland plain of hebei in the north china plain ncp parameters of the fao aquacrop model were calibrated with a dataset collected in the 2012 season and the model was validated with independent data from the next three seasons under the condition of saline water irrigation the simulation of canopy cover soil water content soil electric conductivity biomass and yield was accurate the coefficient of determination r2 0 65 the index of agreement d 0 89 the scenario simulations with different salinity levels in irrigation water were run in growing degree days mode in aquacrop with climatic data from 1958 to 2010 in the high 483 mm and normal 430 mm rainfall years salt was drained out of the soil profile whereas salt was accumulated in the soil profile under the scenario of s2 and s3 while was leaving out the root zone in the scenario of ck and s1 in the low 324 mm rainfall years with the salinity of 4 5 ds m 1 the difference between salt inside and outside of the soil profile tends to be zero based on the scenario simulations the relationships between crop evapotranspiration et a and cotton yield and between et a and water productivity were fitted with a quadratic curve it is concluded from the scenario simulations that there are real risks in soil salinization for cotton production in the lowland plain of hebei in the ncp due to saline water irrigation keywords cotton aquacrop saline water irrigation scenario simulation 1 introduction it is estimated that irrigated farmland which accounts for 20 of the global arable land produces 40 of the total food vörösmarty and sahagian 2000 however agriculture has become the principal freshwater consumer accounting for 70 of the global freshwater withdrawals foley et al 2011 in the face of the population growth and good quality water scarcity tilman et al 2011 rodell et al 2018 a lot of scientists recommend an irrigation with marginal water i e brackish or saline water for alleviating the pressure imposed from agricultural production on water needs skaggs et al 2014 assouline et al 2015 li and ren 2020 in the recent three decades saline water has been increasingly applied in many regions especially in arid and semi arid areas minhas 1996 mehta et al 2000 ould ahmed et al 2010 ozturk et al 2018 huang et al 2019 yang et al 2020 given the risk of saline water irrigation on salt accumulation in the soil huang et al 2019 gao et al 2021 it is of great practical significance to evaluate the effects of saline water irrigation on the soil salt balance and crop growth for sustainable agricultural production in regions with shortages in freshwater sources saline water irrigation increases soil moisture while brings salt into the soil which is potentially harmful to the soil environment and crop growth yang et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 cotton gossypium hirsutum l is a salt tolerant and drought resistant crop often used as a pioneer for cultivation under saline irrigation paiva et al 2013 ayers and westcot 1999 reported that white fiber cotton has a salinity threshold of 7 7 ds m 1 in the soil saturation extract zhang et al 2014 found that a saline irrigation water salinity 5 g l 1 significantly limited cotton growth and yield yang et al 2020 reported salinity threshold of 6 g l 1 for brackish irrigation water irrigation with the proper concentration of salt in the water had little effect on cotton growth and could even regulate plant type reduce water consumption increase cotton yield and water use efficiency zhang et al 2014 soares et al 2020 ren et al 2021 beyond this salinity threshold nevertheless the negative effects of salinity on cotton growth and yield have also been reported in several experiments zhang et al 2014 lima et al 2017 yang et al 2020 except the negative responses of cotton to severe salinity stress salt ions brought by irrigation water into the soil will deteriorate the soil qualities such as causing soil particle expansion collapse of macropores reducing soil porosity and permeability destroying soil aggregate structure and changing microbial population and quantity wang et al 2020 therefore it is required to control the soil salt content in the root zone within an appropriate range for safe utilization of brackish water resources agricultural production in the north china plain ncp has experienced severe freshwater resource scarcity yin et al 2020 however in the lowland plain of hebei in the ncp where saline water resource is abundant cotton wheat maize etc are cultivated with rainfall and supplemental irrigation with saline water zhang et al 2014 suggested applying saline water with an appropriate salt concentration at pre sowing and supplemental irrigation at the early growth stage of cotton could effectively alleviate drought and achieve a high yield although the salt brought into soil by irrigation could be leached below the root zone through rainfall in the mid and late growth period of cotton zhang et al 2014 zheng et al 2020 there is little knowledge about the long term soil salt balance in the root zone of cotton irrigated with saline water therefore the objectives of this research were to 1 evaluate the performance of aquacrop for cotton growth and soil water and salt dynamics under saline water irrigation and to 2 assess soil salt dynamics and cotton production performance under scenarios of brackish water irrigation simulated by aquacrop model with long term history data this approach has implications in the risk assessment and production performance prediction under saline water irrigation 2 materials

available k table 1 presents the basic properties of the soil profile at the beginning of this study the meteorological data were recorded by an automatic weather station located in the experimental site 2 2 experimental design four treatments were replicated four times with the plots arranged in a completely randomized block design each plot was 5 7 m by 6 6 m according to cao et al 2007 saline groundwater covered 91 8 of the experimental area with a capacity of 1 5 1010 m3 water with salinity levels of 2 5 g l 1 about 3 2 8 8 ds m 1 and 5 7 g l 1 about 8 8 12 4 ds m 1 account for 47 8 and 38 5 of regional saline groundwater respectively to explore the utilization value of this water supply the field experiment tested four salinity levels of irrigation water including 1 3 ds m 1 ck 5 4 ds m 1 s1 8 8 ds m 1 s2 and 12 4 ds m 1 s3 local deep groundwater has an electrical conductivity ec of 1 3 ds m 1 designed as ck the deep groundwater was pumped into four removable tanks with a capacity of 3 m3 mixed with the calculated amount of salt and stirred until the salt dissolved and then irrigated to the designed plots the chemical composition of irrigation water is shown in table 2 2 3 agronomic practices cotton seeds gossypium hirsutum l cv jimian 616 were sown on may 2 2012 may 20 2013 may 1 2014 and april 27 2015 the pre planting irrigation table 3 was applied about 4 6 days before sowing aimed to facilitate seed germination and emergence prior to sowing the compound fertilizer of 750 kg ha 1 15 n 15 p2o5 15 k2o was applied to all plots ten rows of cotton in each plot were sown manually at 30 cm plant spacing with 3 seeds per hole the row configuration was an alternating narrow wide spacing of 50 cm and 80 cm and the narrow rows were mulched with transparent plastic film 0 008 mm thick the ratio of bare land to the area covered with plastic film mulch was 1 1 the cotton growth stages during the four seasons are presented in table 4 during the cotton growing season irrigation was scheduled when the soil water content in the soil layer of 0 60 cm decreased to 60 of field capacity 23 2 volumetric water content the irrigation date and amount are shown in table 3 the plants were manually topped at the end of july cotton was harvested manually on november 8 2012 october 27 2013 october 27 2014 and october 27 2015 respectively 2 4 data collection and calculation 2 4 1 meteorological data meteorological data were recorded with an automatic weather station sp200 lsi lastem italy in the experimental site the accumulated precipitations during the cotton growing periods in 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 were 447 2 526 5 256 8 and 342 8 mm respectively using the historical data of precipitation from 1971 to 2007 liu et al 2013 as a baseline i e wet year of 462 1 mm normal year of 368 3 mm and dry year of 285 0 mm 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 was classified as normal wet dry and normal year respectively precipitation and air temperature during the cotton growing season from 2012 to 2015 are shown in fig 1 2 4 2 soil salt and water content soil salinity was evaluated by measuring the ec of a mixed solution of soil and water at a ratio of 1 5 by weight ec 1 5 using a dds 307a conductivity meter shanghai precision scientific instrument shanghai china soil samples for ec measurements were taken from each plot with an auger 3 0 cm diameter at a 10 day interval after sowing the additional observation was made at the end of each growing stage soil samples were taken from two locations the un mulched midpoint between the wide rows and the mulched midpoint between the narrow rows to a depth of 60 cm in 10 cm increment soil samples were ground after air drying and then sieved using a 2 mm sieve to facilitate comparison with other international researches the ec of the saturated soil extract ec e was also measured clear extracts of the saturated soil pastes were obtained by centrifugation at 3180 g for 30 min and ec e was measured using the conductivity meter the relationship between the ec 1 5 and ec e was expressed by the following equation 1 e c e 9 367 e c 1 5 0 001 r 2 0 990 soil water content was measured gravimetrically once a week for every 20 cm from 0 to 100 cm soil samples were taken from two locations the un mulched midpoint between the wide rows and the mulched midpoint between the narrow rows 2 4 3 crop growth and yield the cotton seedling establishment numbers in each plot were investigated at 20 days after sowing then five cotton plants were marked as representative plants in each plot and used to measure plant height leaf area and fruiting branches every 10 days the area of all the leaves from the main stem and fruiting branches was measured manually leaf area was calculated using the following equation 2 a l w n where a leaf area cm2 l leaf length cm w leaf width cm and n was a coefficient of 0 84 hong et al 1985 leaf area index lai was calculated by multiplying the total green leaf area per plant with actual plant density the canopy cover cc was estimated as following katerji et al 2013 3 c c 1 005 1 e 0 6 l a i 1 2 the above ground biomass in each plot was determined with three plants oven dried at 75 c cotton yield for each plot was measured at harvest with three replications of 1 m2 2 5 model calibration and validation detailed descriptions of the aquacrop have been given by raes et al 2009 and steduto et al 2009 although raes et al 2009 reported the cotton parameters of aquacrop model the model should be calibrated and validated with the experimental data as these parameters are not universal aquacrop model was calibrated using the data collected in field experiments in 2012 season as the seasonal rainfall and temperature in the 2012 cotton growing season was similar to the long term averages the dataset included data on soil climate soil water content soil salinity plant biomass plant phenological development and cotton yield the calibration was firstly carried out by fitting performance of ck in the calendar time mode the model was calibrated for cc above ground biomass soil water salinity and yield then the calibrated parameters were repeatedly adjusted using the measured dataset in s1 s2 and s3 until the measured and simulated values matched well for all treatments in 2012 after calibration the aquacrop model was validated with the measured data in 2013 2014 and 2015 the statistical parameters used to evaluate the fitness of the model to the measured data were the root mean square error rmse the index of agreement d and the coefficient of determination r2 which were calculated as 4 rmse 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 5 d 1 i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n s i o o i o 2 6 r 2 i 1 n o i o s i s i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 2 where oi and si are the observed and simulated values o and s are the average observed and simulated values n is the number of observations the model s performance is considered satisfactory when the values of rmse are close to 0 while the values of d and r2 are close to 1 2 6 scenario simulations the aquacrop model was used to simulate soil salinity evapotranspiration plant biomass yield and water productivity of cotton in response to saline water irrigation and to determine the appropriate management of saline water irrigation under the scenarios of different ec values in irrigation water the four levels of salinity in irrigation water 1 3 ds m 1 5 4 ds m 1 8 8 ds m 1 and 12 4 ds m 1 were designed for the scenario simulations the sowing date was assumed as may 1 and the simulation was run in the growing degree days mode the weather data for shenzhou county of hengshui city from 1958 to 2010 were used as input in scenario simulation irrigation was scheduled for sufficient irrigation for cotton growth an irrigation of 75 mm was performed whenever soil water content of the 0 60 cm soil layer reaches to 60 of field capacity 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation adopting a trial and error approach the aquacrop model was calibrated using the data collected in the 2012 season the calibrated crop parameters for cotton are listed in table 5 the gdd for emergence maximum canopy senescence and maturity was 93 c 1068 c 1609 c and 2455 c respectively which was assumed as the mean value in ck during the four seasons the initial canopy cover cco and maximum canopy cover were measured in the field the coefficient of canopy growth cgc and decline cdc was 13 1 day 1 and 0 319 gdd 1 which was calibrated with the variation of cc the values of cgc and cdc in this experiment were higher than the default values 7 6 per day for cgc and 0 25 gdd 1 for cdc the differences have resulted from the effects of cotton cultivar and cultivation the maximum and minimum root depth was 0 90 m and 0 10 m which was observed in the field the normalized water productivity wp was fixed at 17 g m 2 within the range of 15 20 g m 2 for c3 plants the reference harvest index hio was calibrated as 40 and the transpiration coefficient kc tr x was adjusted from 1 10 to 1 05 the values of wp and hio are similar with previous results of cotton in tan et al 2018 wp 20 g m 2 hio 40

hio 30 in the module of salinity stress ec en and ec em of cotton was adjusted as 8 and 30 ds m 1 table 5 which is similar to the result of tan et al 2018 the adjusted f ec shape 2 5 for cotton was similar to the value reported by tan et al 2018 2 5 and mondal et al 2015 2 4 calibration results indicated that the crop parameters were calibrated well with r2 0 76 and d 0 86 table 6 the calibrated model was validated for cc fig 2 sws fig 3 salinity fig 4 biomass fig 5 and yield fig 6 on the independent datasets collected in cotton seasons from 2013 to 2015 the model overestimated cc in 2013 season especially during the mid season of cotton growing cc in ck and s1 in 2014 season was underestimated in the canopy development stage while overestimated in the canopy senescence stage the model underestimated cc in s2 and s3 during the cotton growing season in 2014 cc was satisfactorily simulated in ck s1 and s2 in 2015 season while underestimated in s3 these differences between seasons could be attributed to the variation of seasonal weather factors especially distribution of seasonal precipitation which has significant effects on soil water and salinity cotton canopy senescence were overestimated in 2013 2015 seasons because kc tr x was lower than the recommended value hsiao et al 2009 ahmadi et al 2015 tan et al 2018 on average the model accurately simulated the dynamic of cc for the datasets for all treatments in the three validation seasons with r2 of 0 82 rmse of 12 36 and d of 0 94 fig 2 and table 7 the calibrated model predicted sws in the soil profile of 0 100 cm well in the three validation seasons with r2 of 0 65 rmse of 30 88 mm and d of 0 89 fig 3 and table 7 for all treatments in 2013 sws was underestimated in the early growing season of cotton by the aquacrop model whereas overestimated in the late growing season with r2 lower than 0 5 in 2014 the model overestimated sws in the four treatments in the late growing season these differences in sws were also contributed to the adjusted kc tr x and the inaccurate simulation of root development tan et al 2018 tsakmakis et al 2019 as crop growth and yield formation is markedly influenced by salinity stress accurate simulation of soil salt is vital for saline water irrigation aquacrop model has been validated under the condition of soil salinity for maize hassanli et al 2016 wheat kumar et al 2018 cotton tan et al 2018 and rice mondal et al 2015 the different initial values of salt content in the soil and irrigation water were used to validate the aquacrop model with the adjusted parameters in table 4 dynamics of ec e in the 0 100 cm soil layer in 2013 2015 seasons were simulated precisely by the calibrated aquacrop model with rmse of 0 65 ds m 1 r2 of 0 80 and d of 0 95 fig 4 table 7 in 2013 season ec e was overestimated during the mid season in ck s1 and s2 while underestimated in the early and end season in s3 the model underestimated ec e for s1 s2 and s3 in 2014 with rmse 0 6 ds m 1 and r2 0 6 the differences in ec e simulation maybe result from salt leaching out of root zone mohammadi et al 2016 tan et al 2018 as there were many rain events in cotton seasons fig 1 moreover the assumed root distribution and root water uptake patterns in aquacrop also contributed to these differences in ec e prediction he et al 2018 tan et al 2018 comparison between measured and simulated cotton biomass with the four treatments from 2013 to 2015 are present in fig 5 although the model underestimated the cotton biomass in ck in 2013 season the cotton biomass in s1 were predicted accurately by the calibrated model except for s2 in 2013 the aquacrop model overestimated the cotton biomass in s3 and s2 from 2013 to 2015 overall the cotton biomass could be precisely estimated by the aquacrop model with rmse of 1 19 t ha 1 r2 of 0 92 and d of 0 98 table 7 the value of rmse in the current study are within the range of rmse reported by tan et al 2018 with rmse of 2 52 t ha 1 by tsakmakis et al 2019 with rmse of 1 41 t ha 1 by voloudakis et al 2015 with rmse of 0 17 t ha 1 and by hussein et al 2011 with rmse of 0 45 t ha 1 as for cotton yield the model gave a reliable simulation in 2013 and 2014 with r2 of 0 99 fig 7 while a relatively poor simulation was obtained in 2015 in general the regression slopes between measured and simulated yield were slightly lower than 1 0 indicating that the model somewhat underestimated the cotton yield therefore the calibrated model underestimated cotton yield with rmse of 0 25 t ha 1 r2 of 0 93 and d of 0 98 fig 6 and table 7 tan et al 2018 and hussein et al 2011 also reported that the aquacrop model underestimated cotton yield 3 2 scenario analysis 3 2 1 soil salt balance pearson type iii curve was fitted with historic precipitation data to determine different annual rainfall patterns fig s1 rainfall in the dry normal and wet year was 324 430 and 483 mm respectively dynamics of salt infiltrated in and drained out of the soil profile were simulated and compared with the three typical years of high standard and low rainfall fig 7 as there was no irrigation in the high fig 7a and standard fig 7b rainfall year the salt which was infiltrated in with irrigation water before sowing and residual in the soil from pre seasons was drained out of the soil profile in the year with low rainfall fig 7c the difference δs between salt inside and outside of the profile was negative δs 0 for ck and s1 while was positive δs 0 for s2 and s3 it indicated that salt was accumulated in s2 and s3 while salt was leaving the root zone in ck and s1 in the low rainfall years in the scenarios with historic weather data from 1958 to 2010 the changes in salt storage in the soil profile were negative for the four scenarios fig 8 i e δs 0 as there was no irrigation in more than 25 seasons with the experiments in the lowland plain of hebei in the ncp zhang et al 2018 and feng 2014 suggested that salt accumulation with saline water irrigation could be mitigated by heavy rainfall and it is practicable for the long term use of saline water irrigation however for the seasons with supplementary irrigation the average value of δs was 1 67 t ha 1 in ck 0 27 t ha 1 in s1 2 56 t ha 1 in s2 and 3 69 t ha 1 in s3 fig 8 indicating that salt drained out of the soil profile in ck while accumulated in soil profile in s1 s3 the results indicated that 10 5 60 6 and 62 0 of salt input by irrigation water was accumulated in soil profile for s1 s2 and s3 respectively under the condition of supplementary irrigation it could be concluded that with increase in drought frequency in future the risk of soil salinization would be enhanced under brackish water irrigation when δs tends to 0 the salt concentration in irrigation water was about 4 5 g l 1 which was greater than the critical salinity threshold of 4 g l 1 in irrigation water in this region zheng et al 2020 3 2 2 yield and wp table 8 presents average cotton yield et a and wp under the scenario simulation the average yield in ck s1 s2 and s3 was 3 23 3 24 3 10 and 3 01 t ha 1 for the scenario simulation respectively there was no significant difference in cotton yield between ck s1 and s2 anova results indicated that the cotton yield in s3 was significantly lower than that in ck and s1 while the difference between s3 and s2 was insignificant table 8 the et a simulated with the aquacrop model was 398 50 407 55 408 55 and 407 85 mm for ck s1 s2 and s3 respectively there was no significant difference in et a between the four treatments table 8 fig 9a shows the relationship between et a and cotton yield under the scenario simulation the highest yield ranged from 3 34 t ha 1 to 3 38 t ha 1 for the four irrigation scenarios with the variation of et a between 420 mm and 436 mm zheng et al 2020 reported that the range of cotton yield varied from 2 4 t ha 1 to 3 9 t ha 1 with different salinity levels in irrigation water from 2007 to 2015 in the same site water productivity wp the ratio of crop yield to et a quantifies the crop production per unit of water used singh et al 2006 fig 9b shows the relationship between wp and et a compared with the average wp 0 81 g m 3 in ck the value in s1 0 78 g m 3 s2 0 76 g m 3 and s3 0 75 g m 3 significantly decreased by 3 7 6 2 and 7 4 respectively table 8 there was an insignificant difference in wp between s1 s2 and s3 the maximum wp was 0 86 g m 3 0 82 g m 3 0 79 g m 3 and 0 79 g m 3 for the scenario of ck s1 s2 and s3 and the corresponding et a was 394 mm 408 mm 414 mm and 413 mm respectively compared with ck s1 with ec of 5 4 ds m 1 slightly decreased cotton yield and wp while has a real risk in salt accumulation in soil profile as the groundwater salinity was lower than that in s1 it could reduce the salinity to a suitable range with mixing with saline water li and ren 2021 4 conclusions the 4 year field experimental data on cotton were used to test the performance of the aquacrop model under the four levels of salinity in irrigation water in the lowland plain of hebei in the ncp the model parameters were calibrated and validated for cotton irrigated with saline water the aquacrop could be used as a reliable tool for simulating cotton growth soil water and salt dynamics and yield under the condition of saline water irrigation in this area soil salt dynamics and cotton production performance under scenarios of brackish water irrigation were evaluated with aquacrop model with long term history data indicating that there are certain risks in soil salinization with saline water irrigation for cotton production in the lowland plain of hebei in the ncp credit authorship contribution statement conceptualization and

9748,it is imperative to evaluate the practicality of brackish water irrigation for alleviating the conflict between freshwater resources shortages and food production four years experiments were carried out on cotton from 2012 to 2015 seasons with four salinity levels in irrigation water including 1 3 ds m 1 ck 5 4 ds m 1 s1 8 8 ds m 1 s2 and 12 4 ds m 1 s3 in lowland plain of hebei in the north china plain ncp parameters of the fao aquacrop model were calibrated with a dataset collected in the 2012 season and the model was validated with independent data from the next three seasons under the condition of saline water irrigation the simulation of canopy cover soil water content soil electric conductivity biomass and yield was accurate the coefficient of determination r2 0 65 the index of agreement d 0 89 the scenario simulations with different salinity levels in irrigation water were run in growing degree days mode in aquacrop with climatic data from 1958 to 2010 in the high 483 mm and normal 430 mm rainfall years salt was drained out of the soil profile whereas salt was accumulated in the soil profile under the scenario of s2 and s3 while was leaving out the root zone in the scenario of ck and s1 in the low 324 mm rainfall years with the salinity of 4 5 ds m 1 the difference between salt inside and outside of the soil profile tends to be zero based on the scenario simulations the relationships between crop evapotranspiration et a and cotton yield and between et a and water productivity were fitted with a quadratic curve it is concluded from the scenario simulations that there are real risks in soil salinization for cotton production in the lowland plain of hebei in the ncp due to saline water irrigation keywords cotton aquacrop saline water irrigation scenario simulation 1 introduction it is estimated that irrigated farmland which accounts for 20 of the global arable land produces 40 of the total food vörösmarty and sahagian 2000 however agriculture has become the principal freshwater consumer accounting for 70 of the global freshwater withdrawals foley et al 2011 in the face of the population growth and good quality water scarcity tilman et al 2011 rodell et al 2018 a lot of scientists recommend an irrigation with marginal water i e brackish or saline water for alleviating the pressure imposed from agricultural production on water needs skaggs et al 2014 assouline et al 2015 li and ren 2020 in the recent three decades saline water has been increasingly applied in many regions especially in arid and semi arid areas minhas 1996 mehta et al 2000 ould ahmed et al 2010 ozturk et al 2018 huang et al 2019 yang et al 2020 given the risk of saline water irrigation on salt accumulation in the soil huang et al 2019 gao et al 2021 it is of great practical significance to evaluate the effects of saline water irrigation on the soil salt balance and crop growth for sustainable agricultural production in regions with shortages in freshwater sources saline water irrigation increases soil moisture while brings salt into the soil which is potentially harmful to the soil environment and crop growth yang et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 cotton gossypium hirsutum l is a salt tolerant and drought resistant crop often used as a pioneer for cultivation under saline irrigation paiva et al 2013 ayers and westcot 1999 reported that white fiber cotton has a salinity threshold of 7 7 ds m 1 in the soil saturation extract zhang et al 2014 found that a saline irrigation water salinity 5 g l 1 significantly limited cotton growth and yield yang et al 2020 reported salinity threshold of 6 g l 1 for brackish irrigation water irrigation with the proper concentration of salt in the water had little effect on cotton growth and could even regulate plant type reduce water consumption increase cotton yield and water use efficiency zhang et al 2014 soares et al 2020 ren et al 2021 beyond this salinity threshold nevertheless the negative effects of salinity on cotton growth and yield have also been reported in several experiments zhang et al 2014 lima et al 2017 yang et al 2020 except the negative responses of cotton to severe salinity stress salt ions brought by irrigation water into the soil will deteriorate the soil qualities such as causing soil particle expansion collapse of macropores reducing soil porosity and permeability destroying soil aggregate structure and changing microbial population and quantity wang et al 2020 therefore it is required to control the soil salt content in the root zone within an appropriate range for safe utilization of brackish water resources agricultural production in the north china plain ncp has experienced severe freshwater resource scarcity yin et al 2020 however in the lowland plain of hebei in the ncp where saline water resource is abundant cotton wheat maize etc are cultivated with rainfall and supplemental irrigation with saline water zhang et al 2014 suggested applying saline water with an appropriate salt concentration at pre sowing and supplemental irrigation at the early growth stage of cotton could effectively alleviate drought and achieve a high yield although the salt brought into soil by irrigation could be leached below the root zone through rainfall in the mid and late growth period of cotton zhang et al 2014 zheng et al 2020 there is little knowledge about the long term soil salt balance in the root zone of cotton irrigated with saline water therefore the objectives of this research were to 1 evaluate the performance of aquacrop for cotton growth and soil water and salt dynamics under saline water irrigation and to 2 assess soil salt dynamics and cotton production performance under scenarios of brackish water irrigation simulated by aquacrop model with long term history data this approach has implications in the risk assessment and production performance prediction under saline water irrigation 2 materials

available k table 1 presents the basic properties of the soil profile at the beginning of this study the meteorological data were recorded by an automatic weather station located in the experimental site 2 2 experimental design four treatments were replicated four times with the plots arranged in a completely randomized block design each plot was 5 7 m by 6 6 m according to cao et al 2007 saline groundwater covered 91 8 of the experimental area with a capacity of 1 5 1010 m3 water with salinity levels of 2 5 g l 1 about 3 2 8 8 ds m 1 and 5 7 g l 1 about 8 8 12 4 ds m 1 account for 47 8 and 38 5 of regional saline groundwater respectively to explore the utilization value of this water supply the field experiment tested four salinity levels of irrigation water including 1 3 ds m 1 ck 5 4 ds m 1 s1 8 8 ds m 1 s2 and 12 4 ds m 1 s3 local deep groundwater has an electrical conductivity ec of 1 3 ds m 1 designed as ck the deep groundwater was pumped into four removable tanks with a capacity of 3 m3 mixed with the calculated amount of salt and stirred until the salt dissolved and then irrigated to the designed plots the chemical composition of irrigation water is shown in table 2 2 3 agronomic practices cotton seeds gossypium hirsutum l cv jimian 616 were sown on may 2 2012 may 20 2013 may 1 2014 and april 27 2015 the pre planting irrigation table 3 was applied about 4 6 days before sowing aimed to facilitate seed germination and emergence prior to sowing the compound fertilizer of 750 kg ha 1 15 n 15 p2o5 15 k2o was applied to all plots ten rows of cotton in each plot were sown manually at 30 cm plant spacing with 3 seeds per hole the row configuration was an alternating narrow wide spacing of 50 cm and 80 cm and the narrow rows were mulched with transparent plastic film 0 008 mm thick the ratio of bare land to the area covered with plastic film mulch was 1 1 the cotton growth stages during the four seasons are presented in table 4 during the cotton growing season irrigation was scheduled when the soil water content in the soil layer of 0 60 cm decreased to 60 of field capacity 23 2 volumetric water content the irrigation date and amount are shown in table 3 the plants were manually topped at the end of july cotton was harvested manually on november 8 2012 october 27 2013 october 27 2014 and october 27 2015 respectively 2 4 data collection and calculation 2 4 1 meteorological data meteorological data were recorded with an automatic weather station sp200 lsi lastem italy in the experimental site the accumulated precipitations during the cotton growing periods in 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 were 447 2 526 5 256 8 and 342 8 mm respectively using the historical data of precipitation from 1971 to 2007 liu et al 2013 as a baseline i e wet year of 462 1 mm normal year of 368 3 mm and dry year of 285 0 mm 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 was classified as normal wet dry and normal year respectively precipitation and air temperature during the cotton growing season from 2012 to 2015 are shown in fig 1 2 4 2 soil salt and water content soil salinity was evaluated by measuring the ec of a mixed solution of soil and water at a ratio of 1 5 by weight ec 1 5 using a dds 307a conductivity meter shanghai precision scientific instrument shanghai china soil samples for ec measurements were taken from each plot with an auger 3 0 cm diameter at a 10 day interval after sowing the additional observation was made at the end of each growing stage soil samples were taken from two locations the un mulched midpoint between the wide rows and the mulched midpoint between the narrow rows to a depth of 60 cm in 10 cm increment soil samples were ground after air drying and then sieved using a 2 mm sieve to facilitate comparison with other international researches the ec of the saturated soil extract ec e was also measured clear extracts of the saturated soil pastes were obtained by centrifugation at 3180 g for 30 min and ec e was measured using the conductivity meter the relationship between the ec 1 5 and ec e was expressed by the following equation 1 e c e 9 367 e c 1 5 0 001 r 2 0 990 soil water content was measured gravimetrically once a week for every 20 cm from 0 to 100 cm soil samples were taken from two locations the un mulched midpoint between the wide rows and the mulched midpoint between the narrow rows 2 4 3 crop growth and yield the cotton seedling establishment numbers in each plot were investigated at 20 days after sowing then five cotton plants were marked as representative plants in each plot and used to measure plant height leaf area and fruiting branches every 10 days the area of all the leaves from the main stem and fruiting branches was measured manually leaf area was calculated using the following equation 2 a l w n where a leaf area cm2 l leaf length cm w leaf width cm and n was a coefficient of 0 84 hong et al 1985 leaf area index lai was calculated by multiplying the total green leaf area per plant with actual plant density the canopy cover cc was estimated as following katerji et al 2013 3 c c 1 005 1 e 0 6 l a i 1 2 the above ground biomass in each plot was determined with three plants oven dried at 75 c cotton yield for each plot was measured at harvest with three replications of 1 m2 2 5 model calibration and validation detailed descriptions of the aquacrop have been given by raes et al 2009 and steduto et al 2009 although raes et al 2009 reported the cotton parameters of aquacrop model the model should be calibrated and validated with the experimental data as these parameters are not universal aquacrop model was calibrated using the data collected in field experiments in 2012 season as the seasonal rainfall and temperature in the 2012 cotton growing season was similar to the long term averages the dataset included data on soil climate soil water content soil salinity plant biomass plant phenological development and cotton yield the calibration was firstly carried out by fitting performance of ck in the calendar time mode the model was calibrated for cc above ground biomass soil water salinity and yield then the calibrated parameters were repeatedly adjusted using the measured dataset in s1 s2 and s3 until the measured and simulated values matched well for all treatments in 2012 after calibration the aquacrop model was validated with the measured data in 2013 2014 and 2015 the statistical parameters used to evaluate the fitness of the model to the measured data were the root mean square error rmse the index of agreement d and the coefficient of determination r2 which were calculated as 4 rmse 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 5 d 1 i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n s i o o i o 2 6 r 2 i 1 n o i o s i s i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 2 where oi and si are the observed and simulated values o and s are the average observed and simulated values n is the number of observations the model s performance is considered satisfactory when the values of rmse are close to 0 while the values of d and r2 are close to 1 2 6 scenario simulations the aquacrop model was used to simulate soil salinity evapotranspiration plant biomass yield and water productivity of cotton in response to saline water irrigation and to determine the appropriate management of saline water irrigation under the scenarios of different ec values in irrigation water the four levels of salinity in irrigation water 1 3 ds m 1 5 4 ds m 1 8 8 ds m 1 and 12 4 ds m 1 were designed for the scenario simulations the sowing date was assumed as may 1 and the simulation was run in the growing degree days mode the weather data for shenzhou county of hengshui city from 1958 to 2010 were used as input in scenario simulation irrigation was scheduled for sufficient irrigation for cotton growth an irrigation of 75 mm was performed whenever soil water content of the 0 60 cm soil layer reaches to 60 of field capacity 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation adopting a trial and error approach the aquacrop model was calibrated using the data collected in the 2012 season the calibrated crop parameters for cotton are listed in table 5 the gdd for emergence maximum canopy senescence and maturity was 93 c 1068 c 1609 c and 2455 c respectively which was assumed as the mean value in ck during the four seasons the initial canopy cover cco and maximum canopy cover were measured in the field the coefficient of canopy growth cgc and decline cdc was 13 1 day 1 and 0 319 gdd 1 which was calibrated with the variation of cc the values of cgc and cdc in this experiment were higher than the default values 7 6 per day for cgc and 0 25 gdd 1 for cdc the differences have resulted from the effects of cotton cultivar and cultivation the maximum and minimum root depth was 0 90 m and 0 10 m which was observed in the field the normalized water productivity wp was fixed at 17 g m 2 within the range of 15 20 g m 2 for c3 plants the reference harvest index hio was calibrated as 40 and the transpiration coefficient kc tr x was adjusted from 1 10 to 1 05 the values of wp and hio are similar with previous results of cotton in tan et al 2018 wp 20 g m 2 hio 40

hio 30 in the module of salinity stress ec en and ec em of cotton was adjusted as 8 and 30 ds m 1 table 5 which is similar to the result of tan et al 2018 the adjusted f ec shape 2 5 for cotton was similar to the value reported by tan et al 2018 2 5 and mondal et al 2015 2 4 calibration results indicated that the crop parameters were calibrated well with r2 0 76 and d 0 86 table 6 the calibrated model was validated for cc fig 2 sws fig 3 salinity fig 4 biomass fig 5 and yield fig 6 on the independent datasets collected in cotton seasons from 2013 to 2015 the model overestimated cc in 2013 season especially during the mid season of cotton growing cc in ck and s1 in 2014 season was underestimated in the canopy development stage while overestimated in the canopy senescence stage the model underestimated cc in s2 and s3 during the cotton growing season in 2014 cc was satisfactorily simulated in ck s1 and s2 in 2015 season while underestimated in s3 these differences between seasons could be attributed to the variation of seasonal weather factors especially distribution of seasonal precipitation which has significant effects on soil water and salinity cotton canopy senescence were overestimated in 2013 2015 seasons because kc tr x was lower than the recommended value hsiao et al 2009 ahmadi et al 2015 tan et al 2018 on average the model accurately simulated the dynamic of cc for the datasets for all treatments in the three validation seasons with r2 of 0 82 rmse of 12 36 and d of 0 94 fig 2 and table 7 the calibrated model predicted sws in the soil profile of 0 100 cm well in the three validation seasons with r2 of 0 65 rmse of 30 88 mm and d of 0 89 fig 3 and table 7 for all treatments in 2013 sws was underestimated in the early growing season of cotton by the aquacrop model whereas overestimated in the late growing season with r2 lower than 0 5 in 2014 the model overestimated sws in the four treatments in the late growing season these differences in sws were also contributed to the adjusted kc tr x and the inaccurate simulation of root development tan et al 2018 tsakmakis et al 2019 as crop growth and yield formation is markedly influenced by salinity stress accurate simulation of soil salt is vital for saline water irrigation aquacrop model has been validated under the condition of soil salinity for maize hassanli et al 2016 wheat kumar et al 2018 cotton tan et al 2018 and rice mondal et al 2015 the different initial values of salt content in the soil and irrigation water were used to validate the aquacrop model with the adjusted parameters in table 4 dynamics of ec e in the 0 100 cm soil layer in 2013 2015 seasons were simulated precisely by the calibrated aquacrop model with rmse of 0 65 ds m 1 r2 of 0 80 and d of 0 95 fig 4 table 7 in 2013 season ec e was overestimated during the mid season in ck s1 and s2 while underestimated in the early and end season in s3 the model underestimated ec e for s1 s2 and s3 in 2014 with rmse 0 6 ds m 1 and r2 0 6 the differences in ec e simulation maybe result from salt leaching out of root zone mohammadi et al 2016 tan et al 2018 as there were many rain events in cotton seasons fig 1 moreover the assumed root distribution and root water uptake patterns in aquacrop also contributed to these differences in ec e prediction he et al 2018 tan et al 2018 comparison between measured and simulated cotton biomass with the four treatments from 2013 to 2015 are present in fig 5 although the model underestimated the cotton biomass in ck in 2013 season the cotton biomass in s1 were predicted accurately by the calibrated model except for s2 in 2013 the aquacrop model overestimated the cotton biomass in s3 and s2 from 2013 to 2015 overall the cotton biomass could be precisely estimated by the aquacrop model with rmse of 1 19 t ha 1 r2 of 0 92 and d of 0 98 table 7 the value of rmse in the current study are within the range of rmse reported by tan et al 2018 with rmse of 2 52 t ha 1 by tsakmakis et al 2019 with rmse of 1 41 t ha 1 by voloudakis et al 2015 with rmse of 0 17 t ha 1 and by hussein et al 2011 with rmse of 0 45 t ha 1 as for cotton yield the model gave a reliable simulation in 2013 and 2014 with r2 of 0 99 fig 7 while a relatively poor simulation was obtained in 2015 in general the regression slopes between measured and simulated yield were slightly lower than 1 0 indicating that the model somewhat underestimated the cotton yield therefore the calibrated model underestimated cotton yield with rmse of 0 25 t ha 1 r2 of 0 93 and d of 0 98 fig 6 and table 7 tan et al 2018 and hussein et al 2011 also reported that the aquacrop model underestimated cotton yield 3 2 scenario analysis 3 2 1 soil salt balance pearson type iii curve was fitted with historic precipitation data to determine different annual rainfall patterns fig s1 rainfall in the dry normal and wet year was 324 430 and 483 mm respectively dynamics of salt infiltrated in and drained out of the soil profile were simulated and compared with the three typical years of high standard and low rainfall fig 7 as there was no irrigation in the high fig 7a and standard fig 7b rainfall year the salt which was infiltrated in with irrigation water before sowing and residual in the soil from pre seasons was drained out of the soil profile in the year with low rainfall fig 7c the difference δs between salt inside and outside of the profile was negative δs 0 for ck and s1 while was positive δs 0 for s2 and s3 it indicated that salt was accumulated in s2 and s3 while salt was leaving the root zone in ck and s1 in the low rainfall years in the scenarios with historic weather data from 1958 to 2010 the changes in salt storage in the soil profile were negative for the four scenarios fig 8 i e δs 0 as there was no irrigation in more than 25 seasons with the experiments in the lowland plain of hebei in the ncp zhang et al 2018 and feng 2014 suggested that salt accumulation with saline water irrigation could be mitigated by heavy rainfall and it is practicable for the long term use of saline water irrigation however for the seasons with supplementary irrigation the average value of δs was 1 67 t ha 1 in ck 0 27 t ha 1 in s1 2 56 t ha 1 in s2 and 3 69 t ha 1 in s3 fig 8 indicating that salt drained out of the soil profile in ck while accumulated in soil profile in s1 s3 the results indicated that 10 5 60 6 and 62 0 of salt input by irrigation water was accumulated in soil profile for s1 s2 and s3 respectively under the condition of supplementary irrigation it could be concluded that with increase in drought frequency in future the risk of soil salinization would be enhanced under brackish water irrigation when δs tends to 0 the salt concentration in irrigation water was about 4 5 g l 1 which was greater than the critical salinity threshold of 4 g l 1 in irrigation water in this region zheng et al 2020 3 2 2 yield and wp table 8 presents average cotton yield et a and wp under the scenario simulation the average yield in ck s1 s2 and s3 was 3 23 3 24 3 10 and 3 01 t ha 1 for the scenario simulation respectively there was no significant difference in cotton yield between ck s1 and s2 anova results indicated that the cotton yield in s3 was significantly lower than that in ck and s1 while the difference between s3 and s2 was insignificant table 8 the et a simulated with the aquacrop model was 398 50 407 55 408 55 and 407 85 mm for ck s1 s2 and s3 respectively there was no significant difference in et a between the four treatments table 8 fig 9a shows the relationship between et a and cotton yield under the scenario simulation the highest yield ranged from 3 34 t ha 1 to 3 38 t ha 1 for the four irrigation scenarios with the variation of et a between 420 mm and 436 mm zheng et al 2020 reported that the range of cotton yield varied from 2 4 t ha 1 to 3 9 t ha 1 with different salinity levels in irrigation water from 2007 to 2015 in the same site water productivity wp the ratio of crop yield to et a quantifies the crop production per unit of water used singh et al 2006 fig 9b shows the relationship between wp and et a compared with the average wp 0 81 g m 3 in ck the value in s1 0 78 g m 3 s2 0 76 g m 3 and s3 0 75 g m 3 significantly decreased by 3 7 6 2 and 7 4 respectively table 8 there was an insignificant difference in wp between s1 s2 and s3 the maximum wp was 0 86 g m 3 0 82 g m 3 0 79 g m 3 and 0 79 g m 3 for the scenario of ck s1 s2 and s3 and the corresponding et a was 394 mm 408 mm 414 mm and 413 mm respectively compared with ck s1 with ec of 5 4 ds m 1 slightly decreased cotton yield and wp while has a real risk in salt accumulation in soil profile as the groundwater salinity was lower than that in s1 it could reduce the salinity to a suitable range with mixing with saline water li and ren 2021 4 conclusions the 4 year field experimental data on cotton were used to test the performance of the aquacrop model under the four levels of salinity in irrigation water in the lowland plain of hebei in the ncp the model parameters were calibrated and validated for cotton irrigated with saline water the aquacrop could be used as a reliable tool for simulating cotton growth soil water and salt dynamics and yield under the condition of saline water irrigation in this area soil salt dynamics and cotton production performance under scenarios of brackish water irrigation were evaluated with aquacrop model with long term history data indicating that

9749,waterlogging wl during the early growing stage is one of the most important environmental factors limiting maize zea mays l production the application of nitrogen n fertilizer is important to maintain normal plant growth and defense against abiotic stresses however the effects of n fertilization on biomass accumulation and partitioning as well as n utilization in maize under wl stress remains unclear thus we conducted a two year field experiment at jingzhou city central china to investigate the effects of varying n fertilizer application rates 0 90 180 270 and 360 kg n ha 1 on shoot biomass accumulation and its distribution n uptake and n use efficiency in maize under well watered ww conditions throughout the maize growing season and wl for 6 d at the sixth leaf stage compared to the ww condition wl significantly reduced shoot biomass n accumulation harvest index n harvest index nitrate reductase activity n use efficiency and n partial factor productivity at all n application rates moreover these parameters excluding n partial factor productivity increased with increasing n application rates up to 360 kg n ha 1 under wl suggesting that a high n rate such as 360 kg n ha 1 could improve the accumulation and distribution of shoot biomass and n utilization of waterlogged maize the enhanced shoot biomass nitrate reductase activity n accumulation and n use efficiency were related to increased root biomass and root length density at higher n treatments under wl in addition compared with other n treatments 360 kg n ha 1 resulted in a better proportion of biomass distribution in the kernel and improved transfer of biomass from the vegetative organs to grain under wl which accounted for the enhanced harvest index therefore an appropriate increase in the nitrogen application rates up to 360 kg n ha 1 helped to improve biomass accumulation in the shoot and its transfer to the grain together with n use efficiency in maize under early sixth leaf stage waterlogging keywords leaf area harvest index nitrogen metabolism root growth zea mays 1 introduction waterlogging wl or flooding often occurs where there is substantial precipitation poor soil drainage and significant fluctuations in the high groundwater level ren et al 2016 it is estimated that waterlogged areas account for 12 of the world s cropping areas li et al 2006 along with global climate change wl is becoming a worldwide natural disaster the magnitude and frequency of wl have been predicted to increase particularly in high and mid latitude regions herzog et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 including the huanghuaihai plain and the jianghan plain in china ren et al 2017 wl leads to greater reliance on anaerobic respiration seen in the accumulation of toxins in the rhizosphere including hydrogen sulfide h2s and ferrous sulfide fes this toxic environment leads to reduced absorption of minerals and beneficial trace elements resulting in poor growth and development of the root system ren et al 2016 zhang et al 2021 moreover wl inhibits the accumulation and distribution of both biomass and nitrogen n in different organs leading to reduced n use efficiency and poor grain yields wu et al 2015 ren et al 2016 2017 wl is also known to produce adverse effects on plant physiological processes including decreased cell permeability zhang et al 2021 reduced root activity and respiration kaur et al 2020 and antioxidant inhibition resulting in the closure of stomata reduced chlorophyll concentrations in the leaves and a decline in the net photosynthetic rate p n zhou and oosterhuis 2012 tian et al 2021 the reduction in plant growth after wl may be related to lower levels of soil oxygen which limit both carbon and n metabolism and adversely affect the availability of soil nutrients including n herzog et al 2016 ren et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 in particular waterlogged plants suffer from n deficiency due to the enhanced denitrification and leaching of mobile nutrients limami et al 2014 kaur et al 2020 together with reduced rates of n mineralization haddad et al 2013 caused by the excessive soil moisture the application of n fertilizer is important for regulating crop growth and yield even under wl conditions e g wu et al 2015 men et al 2020 increasing the application of n fertilizer can augment the activities of superoxide dismutase peroxidase and

under a short term wl for 3 7 d a high rate of n fertilization 312 kg n ha 1 resulted in less reduction in maize yield compared to a low n rate 45 kg n ha 1 after 72 h of wl stress 20 reduction vs 35

wheat resulting in improved plant nutrition and a relatively high grain yield wu et al 2013 2014 however an early study showed that the application of high n concentrations lowered n uptake subsequently reducing biomass and the redistribution of carbohydrate stores from the vegetative organs to the grain resulting in a more significant grain yield loss in wheat under post anthesis wl jiang et al 2008 in addition guo et al 2010 illustrated that appropriate n application 240 kg n ha 1 increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes and reduced lipid peroxidation thus improving the wl resistance of cotton whereas excessive n supply 480 kg n ha 1 behaved in the opposite way therefore the n fertilizer application rate should be carefully considered to reduce stress damage and promote the recovery of crop growth after the relief of wl stress although maize requires large amounts of water it is not resistant to wl the average rainfall on the jianghan plain is about 500 800 mm during the maize growing season usually covering the period between the v6 and maturity moreover the early growth stages of maize are susceptible to wl stress ren et al 2016 in addition shoot biomass accumulation and its distribution and n utilization are closely related to the crop yield arduini et al 2019 qi et al 2020a however to the best of our knowledge the effects of n fertilizer on maize shoot biomass accumulation and its distribution n uptake and use efficiency under wl and the physiological mechanisms underlying this remain largely unknown therefore the objectives of this study were to investigate 1 the shoot biomass accumulation and its distribution in response to varying n rates and 2 the effects on shoot n uptake n use efficiency nue nitrogen partial factor productivity pfpn and nitrogen harvest index nhi of maize under wl at the v6 stage various agronomic and physiological traits including leaf area index chlorophyll spad value nr activity harvest index root biomass and root length density were determined we hypothesized that appropriate increases in the n application rates improve root and leaf growth increasing the shoot biomass and its distribution to grain as well as nue in wl conditions to compensate for n loss due to wl the results will provide an essential scientific basis for the efficient management of n fertilization and further understanding of the physiological mechanisms underlying n fertilization in alleviating wl stress in maize 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site a two year 2018 and 2019 field experiment was performed at the agrometeorological experimental station of jingzhou city central china latitude 30 21 n longitude112 31 e altitude 30 m the station is located in a region with a typical subtropical monsoon climate zone with mean annual precipitation annual sunshine duration and annual temperature of 1095 mm 1718 h and 16 5 respectively the accumulated temperature above 10 c is 5094 9 5294 3 c the soil texture at the experimental site is calcareous alluvial the basic physicochemical properties of the experimental soil are summarized in table 1 the average air temperature precipitation and hours of sunshine during the maize growing season are shown in table 2 2 2 experimental design a split plot experimental plan was established using water regime as the main plots and n rate as subplots there were three replications for each treatment subplot the plot size was 16 m2 4 m 4 m and polyvinyl chloride pvc boards 4 m 2 3 m were used around the plot inserted to 2 0 m below the soil surface and with 0 4 m remaining above the ground to prevent water movement water regimes included ww or a relative soil mass water content of 70 85 field capacity fc as a reasonable control during the maize grown season ww and wl where a 2 3 cm water layer was retained for 6 d above the soil surface at the v6 stage the wl was initiated 41 days after planting dap of the crop in 2018 and 42 dap in 2019 the surface water in the wl plots was removed using a siphon at the end of the wl period and the soil moisture content was gradually reduced to that of the control soil moisture content of ww with a period of 5 7 d the n application rates included 0 n0 90 n1 180 n2 270 n3 and 360 n4 kg n ha 1 which were applied to each water regime the n fertilizer urea n 46 application was split into a basal application 40 on 31 march 2018 and 3 april 2019 and a top dressing fertilization at the twelfth leaf growth stage v12 60 on 25 june 2018 and 28 jun 2019 2 3 crop management the crop management strategies were described in detail by tian et al 2021 briefly ditches were arranged for each subplot to drain excessive water caused by heavy rainfall during the crop growing season excluding the v6 stage of maize under the wl treatment water was pumped onto the wl plots 4 6 times per day to maintain a 2 3 cm layer of free water above the field surface throughout the wl period no irrigation water was added to the maize excluded the wl due to a considerable amount of precipitation across the two experimental years table 2 calcium superphosphate and potash muriate were applied at rates of 329 kg ha 1 p2o5 17 and 300 kg ha 1 k2o 60 respectively before sowing maize cultivar with yidan no 629 was planted with a density of 73 000 plants ha 1 on 1 april 2018 and 4 april 2019 and the crops were harvested on 9 august 2018 and 11 august 2019 2 4 data collection 2 4 1 shoot biomass and its distribution five plants of each plot at the tasseling vt and maturity r6 stages were harvested for biomass determination corresponding to dap 92 and dap 127 in 2018 and dap 91 and dap 129 in 2019 respectively the sampled above ground parts of the plant were split into different components namely the leaf stem sheath and ear and the ear was further separated into the cob and kernel components at the r6 stage all samples were then dried in a drier at 75 0c to a consistent weight and were weighed to determine shoot biomass and calculate its distribution proportion of the related organ to the whole shoot qi et al 2020a 2 4 2 leaf area index lai and spad value leaf area and spad values were determined at the v6 v12 vt silking r1 filling r2 and milk r4 stages of maize corresponding to dap 47 78 92 100 109 and 120 in 2018 and dap 48 79 91 101 110 and 119 in 2019 respectively a portable spad 502 chlorophyll meter minolta camera co japan was used for measuring the spad values a graduated ruler was used for the measurement of leaf length l and leaf width w and the leaf area was calculated following the method of combe 2005 the lai was calculated by the ratio of total plant leaf area to per unit ground area 2 4 3 nitrogen uptake and its utilization and grain yield n concentrations in the mature plants were analyzed using the semi micro kjeldahl method aoac 1984 the shoot n uptake was calculated from the sum of the products of biomass and tissue n contents the nues included the nue the ratio of grain yield to the total amount of n uptake in shoots pfpn the ratio of grain yield to the amount of n application and nhi the ratio of the amount of n in grains to the amount of n in shoot biomass according to ju et al 2015 a dimension of 6 0 m2 in the center of each plot was harvested for grain yield determination adjusted to 14 5 moisture 2 4 4 nitrate reductase nr activity the nr activity from five representative leaves second fully expanded leaves was estimated at the v6 vt and r1 stages corresponding to the same dates as the leaf area measurement according to the method of aslam et al 2001 2 4 5 root sampling root biomass and root length were determined at the r1 and r6 stages on the same days as the shoot biomass measurement a hand driven auger diameter in 10 cm and length in 1 25 m was used for root sampling the samples were collected from 0 to 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm soil depths below the plant the root samples were first rinsed then arranged and floated in a glass container with shallow water and finally scanned using a scanner epson expression 1680 scanner seiko epson corp tokyo japan the root length was analyzed by the winrhizo root analyzer system regent instruments inc quebec canada the scanned seeds were dried at 75 c to a constant weight and weighed 2 5 data analysis the harvest index was calculated as the ratio of grain weight to shoot biomass at the r6 stage root length density rld was calculated as the ratio of root length to the volume of sampling soil the biomass transfer amount bta g plant 1 its transfer rate btr and the contribution rate of bta from vegetative organs to grain gcr were calculated by using eqs 1 3 respectively xu et al 2009 as follows 1 bta biomass in organ at the vt biomass in organ at the 2 biomass transfer rate biomass transfer amount in one organ biomass amount in the organ at the vt 100 3 gcr dta grain dry weight 100 2 6 statistical analysis results were subjected to analysis of variance anova using spss 12 0 software chicago il usa data were arranged in a split split plot design with years allocated as the main plots soil water conditions ww and wl as the sub plots and the n application rates n0 n1 n2 n3 and n4 as the sub subplots three replicates were used duncan s test was used to determine differences between means and p values 0 05 were considered statistically significant 3 results the analysis of variance revealed a significant interaction between soil water condition and n application rates for most of the measured parameters conversely the influence of year and the interactions with year were not significant for any of the variables measured probably because the differences in temperature between 2018 and 2019 were minor table 2 and the maize crops were irrigated when necessary therefore data were pooled and presented across the years steel and torrie 1980 the phenological development of maize was comparable among the different n application rates under the same water regime across the two years however the wl delayed the phenological development of maize and the growth processes from the v6 to r6 stages in wl were 1 2 d longer than those under ww conditions table 3 3 1 shoot biomass at the vt post vt and r6 stages the shoot biomass of the maize was significantly smaller in wl treatment than ww treatment irrespective of n application table 4 the shoot biomass at the vt post vt and r6 stages was significantly reduced in n0 plants compared to other n rates under the two water regimes under ww treatment the shoot biomass increased dramatically with the n application rate up to n3 and then decreased under the n4 under the wl treatment the shoot biomass increased with the n application rate up to n4 and the differences were statistically significant among the different n rates at the r6 stage table 4 3 2 distribution proportion of shoot biomass and harvest index the biomass distribution proportion in the stems and leaves was significantly greater in the wl coupled with n0 treatment than in the other treatments table 5 the ww combined with n3 treatment resulted in the smallest distribution proportion in the stems and leaves the n0 and n1 treatments resulted in a significantly greater distribution proportion in the cob than the other n application rates under the ww the n4 resulted in a significantly lower distribution proportion in the cob than the other n rates under the wl table 5 the biomass distribution proportion in the kernel and the harvest index showed similar variations among the different treatments compared with the shoot biomass at the r6 stage table 5 3 3 shoot biomass transfer and its contribution rate to grain the biomass transfer amount bta its transfer rate btr and the contribution of the bta from the vegetative organs to grain gcr were highest in the leaves followed by the stems and sheaths for all treatments table 6 however the changes in bta btr and gcr were not consistent among the different treatments the bta btr and gcr in leaves stem and sheath were significantly reduced in the wl condition compared to the ww treatment for all n rates both n0 and n1 resulted in decreased bta btr and gcr in the leaves stems and sheaths compared to the other n rates under the ww condition the bta btr and gcr values in the leaves stems and sheaths increased with increasing n application rates under wl the ww condition coupled with n3 or n4 produced the highest bta btr and gcr values in the leaves stems and sheaths while wl combined with n0 resulted in the lowest bta btr and gcr values in the leaves stems and sheaths compared to the other treatments table 6 3 4 nitrate reductase nr activity nitrate reductase nr activities at the v6 vt and r1 stages were significantly lower in the wl than in the ww treatment for each n rate table 7 moreover the nr activity at the v6 was significantly lower in the n0 compared to the other n application rates under the two water regimes the nr activity at the vt and r1 stages among the different treatments showed a similar variation compared with the shoot biomass at the r6 stage table 7 3 5 nitrogen uptake and its utilization n accumulation nhi nue and pfpn were significantly greater in the ww compared to the wl treatment irrespective of the n application rate table 8 nitrogen accumulation increased with increased n application up to n3 and was then maintained under the n4 treatment under the ww condition while accumulation increased under all n applications under wl the nhi and nue increased with the increase in n application rates up to n3 before plateauing at the n4 under both water regimes the pfpn decreased with increasing n application rates to n4 under the ww and decreased in response to increasing n to the n3 followed by a plateau at n4 under the wl 3 6 root length density rld and root biomass in all treatments both the rld and root biomass were reduced significantly from the r1 to r6 growth stages figs 1 and 2 the rld at the r1 stage and root biomass at the r6 stage among the different treatments showed a similar variation compared with the shoot biomass at the r6 stage figs 1 and 2 the rld at the r6 stage and root biomass at the r1 stage increased with the increase in n application up to n3 then decreased at the n4 under the ww and they increased with the increase in n rates up to n3 plateauing at the n4 under the wl figs 1 and 2 4 discussion wl during the early v3 and v6 growth stages resulted in longer term adverse eﬀects on maize growth seen in the continued observation of early leaf senescence reduced n uptake and metabolism and retarded photosynthetic rate during the late growth stages ren et al 2016 2017 in the present study the wl resulted in consistently reduced shoot biomass table 4 accompanied by smaller lai table s1 chlorophyll spad value table s2 and nr activity table 7 at the latter vt and r1 growth stages it has been found that larger leaf areas during the later growth stages of wheat contribute to extended photosynthesis giunta et al 2008 thus the decrease in lai is indicative of reduced photosynthesis in the leaves tian et al 2021 and decreased accumulation of shoot biomass flooding reduced the leaf thylakoids chlorophyll content and leaf water potential possibly accounting for the reduced p n under wl zhang et al 2021 moreover nr is one of the key enzymes in n metabolism controlling the first step of n uptake and utilization liu et al 2017 thus reduced nr activity is likely to affect plant normal n metabolism phukan et al 2016 ren et al 2017 alternatively wl decreased the activities of rubpcase and pepcase ren et al 2018 and reduced contents of soluble sugars and proteins guo et al 2009 in the leaves resulting in an imbalance between carbon and n metabolism zhang et al 2021 and consequently inhibiting the normal photosynthetic functions of the maize leaf in addition the growth and development of above ground plants depend on the acquisition of soil nutrients and water by the root systems fan et al 2016 thus the reduced shoot growth can be attributed to poor performance of the root system after wl ren et al 2016 arduini et al 2019 as shown by the reduced rld fig 1 and root biomass fig 2 under the wl the inhibition of root growth can be explained as follows first it is widely observed that anaerobiosis occurs when the soil is saturated with water hossain and uddin 2011 zhang et al 2021 tissues that consume large amounts of oxygen such as actively dividing root meristems are the first victims of the depleted oxygen and their cells rapidly enter an energy crisis condition loreti et al 2016 resulting in a decrease of root respiration that may also lead to the death of the root cells zhang et al 2021 second additional adverse conditions caused by wl in soil are the accumulation of co2 ethylene and biochemically reduced compounds in the root rhizosphere leading to inhibited root growth ren et al 2016 third root growth can also be limited by low soil n availability tian et al 2021 as a consequence of denitrification and n leaching due to wl kaur et al 2020 we also observed that a high rate of n application as in n4 enhanced shoot biomass table 4 under the wl this is in line with previous findings on cotton guo et al 2010 winter wheat wu et al 2015 and winter rapeseed liu et al 2017 suggesting that appropriate elevations in n fertilization can enhance plant tolerance to wl stress the reasons can be explained as follows first higher n applications applied before wl promotes root vigor after wl stress zhou and oosterhuis 2012 here 40 of n fertilizer was used as the basal application the remaining 60 of the n fertilizer was used as top dressing at the v12 stage after wl second higher n treatments enhance soil n availability after wl tian et al 2021 resulting in the greater rld fig 1 and root biomass fig 1 values which contribute to the improved efficiency of soil nutrient and water absorption by the roots skinner et al 1998 fan et al 2016 thus improving the plant n nutrition status qi et al 2020b the enhanced chlorophyll spad value table s2 and nr activity table 7 confirmed this wl induces soil n deficiency due to denitrification ammonia volatilization and n leaching limami et al 2014 nguyen et al 2018 in the present study the n3 produced the greatest shoot biomass table 4 under the ww but not under the wl the n4 did which supports our hypothesis that wl causes considerable n loss third the enhanced lai at the higher n treatments at the latter growth stages under the wl table s1 established a solid foundation for high shoot biomass qi et al 2020a in support supplemental n ameliorated the photosynthetic rate by promoting the synthesis of photosynthetic enzymes inhibiting abscisic acid production and stimulating gibberellic and cytokinin synthesis ma et al 2008 in addition compared with the n0 treatment the n fertilization treatments mainly increased shoot biomass of the waterlogged maize at the post vt stages rather than the vt stages table 4 which is consistent with the findings of an earlier study that n fertilization only increased the wheat biomass at the post flowering stage liang et al 2020 kernel crop n requirement characteristics usually low at the early growth stage and up to peak at the flowering or filling stage may partially account for this difference in the present study the maize was waterlogged for 6 d at the v6 stage after the v6 stage the maize plants enter a vigorous growth period their n requirements increase rapidly jing et al 2013 resulting in positive eﬀects on shoot growth following increased application of n fertilizer thus we concluded that supplementary n fertilization improves maize growth mainly during the tasseling to maturity periods after wl s early sixth leaf stage the harvest index is used to indicate the ability of the plant to transport source organ assimilates to sinks wl decreased the degree of biomass transfer from the vegetative organs to the grain before flowering liang et al 2020 which has been found to adversely affect the average growth and development of summer maize e g lowering the root shoot ratio ren et al 2016 leading to a smaller crop harvest index ren et al 2016 arduini et al 2019 liang et al 2020 in the present study the wl decreased the harvest index by lowering the distribution proportion of biomass in the kernel table 5 and contribution rate of biomass transfer amount from vegetative organs to grain gcr in leaves stems and sheaths table 6 this could be related to the reduced amounts of carbon in the ears 53 1 due to reduced activity of sucrose cleaving enzymes and p n caused by wl at an early v3 growth stage of maize hu et al 2021 combined with the previous study and our present results it can be concluded that early sixth leaf stage wl inhibits the plant s ability to transport carbohydrates from source to sink organs in maize however masoni et al 2016 reported that wl did not influence the harvest index in barley at the tillering stage the percentage dry weight reduction in the straw and roots was approximately the same as that in the grain moreover increasing gcr is an effective way to improve grain yield in kernel crops yin et al 2016 qi et al 2020a the present study found that a high n application rate as in n4 helps to improve the distribution proportion of biomass in the kernel table 5 and gcr in leaves stems and sheaths table 6 and consequently to produce a greater harvest index table 5 under the wl this could be related to relatively high soil n availability resulting from high n fertilizer treatments tian et al 2021 which enhances the transfer rate of carbohydrates from source to sink xu et al 2009 yin et al 2016 alternatively supplementary application of n fertilizer increase activities of superoxide dismutase peroxidase and catalase and thus alleviating the oxidative membrane damage caused by wl men et al 2020 and improving the transportation and distribution of photoassimilates wu et al 2015 also appropriate increases in the n supply after wl prolongs the vigorous growth of the root system guo et al 2010 and retards leaf senescence wu et al 2014 thus enhancing the transfer of assimilated nutrients from the vegetative organs to the grain li et al 2020 these results highlight the critical role of gcr in improving maize grain yield under wl and provide some helpful information to understanding the mechanism underlying n mediated enhancement of plant tolerance to wl stress wl stress adversely affects n uptake and utilization by plants wu et al 2015 arduini et al 2019 due to one or more of the following effects low soil n availability nguyen et al 2018 inhibited root growth ren et al 2016 ploschuk et al 2018 or the energy crisis caused by anaerobiosis in the root environment which impairs the active transport of nitrate against its electrochemical gradient pang et al 2007 zhang et al 2021 thus it is not easy to determine whether the lower n availability to roots and or the lower n translocation to the shoot is responsible for the reduced root and shoot growth arduini et al 2019 in this study the wl significantly decreased shoot n accumulation and nue table 8 this could be related to wl related decreases in the root absorption area active absorption area root bleeding rate and consequently root activity ren et al 2016 alternatively wl may delay the processes of plant growth ren et al 2014 table 3 inhibit root growth figs 1 and 2 and accelerate root senescence ren et al 2016 resulting in a lack of n nutrient supplies at the start of the reproductive growth of maize wu et al 2018 moreover wl reduced the soil nitrate content required for plant growth and yield by altering the ammonia oxidizing communities nguyen et al 2018 resulting in a significant reduction of ears per ha kernels per ear and 1000 kernel weight ultimately leading to reduced grain yields tian et al 2021 finally nhi reflects the distribution of n in grains to the total n in the shoot biomass at the r6 stage jin et al 2012 it has been shown that wl reduces grain n accumulation ren et al 2017 resulting in the decreased nhi table 8 indicating that early sixth leaf stage wl reduced the distribution of n in grains to the total n in maize in addition n0 application resulted in the lowest shoot biomass table 4 and n accumulation table 8 suggesting that the n0 treatment further accelerated maize n deficiency under wl conditions this was associated with the combined stress of wl and n deficiency which significantly inhibited normal plant growth tian et al 2021 as shown by the reduced lai table s1 chlorophyll spad value table s2 nr activity table 7 and nhi table 8 in the present study in support ren et al 2017 demonstrated that the reduced n accumulation was attributed to a reduction in the activities of key n metabolism enzymes nr glutamine glutamate synthase and glutamate dehydrogenase in maize due to wl thus we argue that both lower soil n availability and lower n translocation account for the reduced shoot growth and n utilization of maize under early sixth leaf stage wl however this is contrary to the findings of arduini et al 2019 that wl affected the growth of oat roots in a pot culture as well as n translocation to the shoot rather than soil n availability which was supported by enhanced net uptake rates of plant n after wl this contradiction may be explained by differences in wl duration test crops and experimental conditions kaur et al 2020 a relatively low fertilizer n loss has been observed in pot culture compared with field conditions wang et al 2019 which may be partially responsible for the normal supply of soil n in the former the effect of n management strategies on crop nue and the underlying mechanisms under drought conditions have been widely reported e g li et al 2009 lu et al 2021 however there is a lack of information on the effects of n fertilization on the nue of waterlogged crops and its possible causes liu et al 2017 in the present study we found that appropriate increases in n application help to improve nr activity table 7 shoot n accumulation and nhi table 8 accompanied by enhanced grain yields tian et al 2021 and consequently a relatively high nue the wl induced n deficiency both in soil and plant as described above it is widely accepted that increases in the n supply will significantly improve maize yields when the soil n content is low under ww conditions li et al 2020 moreover additional n fertilizer application known as rescue n has been shown to improve root respiratory activity and p n kaur et al 2020 antioxidant defense system and osmoregulation tian et al 2021 which contributed to improving n metabolism and uptake in waterlogged plants wu et al 2018 in addition the enhanced rld at higher n treatments under wl was responsible for the improved nue as n uptake by maize plants was positively correlated with rld zhang et al 2005 qi et al 2020b nitrogen partial factor productivity pfpn is an important indicator used to reflect the productivity of n fertilizers maintaining a large crop yield with relatively high pfpn is vital for both production and environmental protection past studies have shown that the n fertilizer s productivity usually decreases with increased rates of fertilization li et al 2019 zou et al 2020 indicating relatively lower economic returns under high n supply conditions in agreement with this although the pfpn was reduced significantly with increasing rates of n application under the two water regimes table 8 the decrement in the pfpn was reduced under wl this indicated that a high n rate as in n4 produces more economic benefits for maize production under early stage wl undoubtedly a high n application rate as in n4 poses a relatively high risk of n loss by ammonia volatilization leaching and denitrification of nitrate n resulting in the waste of agricultural resources and problems of environmental pollution ju et al 2009 thus these issues merit further study under wl conditions 5 conclusions early sixth leaf stage waterlogging for 6 d inhibited root root length density and root biomass and leaf lai growth at the post tasseling stages resulting in reduced shoot biomass and nitrogen accumulation as well as their distribution to the grain parts of the plants resulting in a low nitrogen use efficiency in maize moreover increasing the nitrogen fertilization rates partially ameliorated the adverse effects of early stage waterlogging on maize shoot biomass accumulation distribution and nitrogen use efficiency by improving both root and leaf growth the improved harvest index at a high level of nitrogen treatment 360 kg n ha 1 under early stage waterlogging was associated with an improved proportion of biomass distribution in the kernel and improved biomass transfer from the vegetative organs to the grain therefore we conclude that appropriate increases in the nitrogen application rate up to 360 kg n ha 1 could improve shoot biomass and distribution and nitrogen use efficiency in maize under early stage waterlogging the results also suggest the physiological mechanisms underlying plant shoot biomass and distribution and nitrogen

9749,waterlogging wl during the early growing stage is one of the most important environmental factors limiting maize zea mays l production the application of nitrogen n fertilizer is important to maintain normal plant growth and defense against abiotic stresses however the effects of n fertilization on biomass accumulation and partitioning as well as n utilization in maize under wl stress remains unclear thus we conducted a two year field experiment at jingzhou city central china to investigate the effects of varying n fertilizer application rates 0 90 180 270 and 360 kg n ha 1 on shoot biomass accumulation and its distribution n uptake and n use efficiency in maize under well watered ww conditions throughout the maize growing season and wl for 6 d at the sixth leaf stage compared to the ww condition wl significantly reduced shoot biomass n accumulation harvest index n harvest index nitrate reductase activity n use efficiency and n partial factor productivity at all n application rates moreover these parameters excluding n partial factor productivity increased with increasing n application rates up to 360 kg n ha 1 under wl suggesting that a high n rate such as 360 kg n ha 1 could improve the accumulation and distribution of shoot biomass and n utilization of waterlogged maize the enhanced shoot biomass nitrate reductase activity n accumulation and n use efficiency were related to increased root biomass and root length density at higher n treatments under wl in addition compared with other n treatments 360 kg n ha 1 resulted in a better proportion of biomass distribution in the kernel and improved transfer of biomass from the vegetative organs to grain under wl which accounted for the enhanced harvest index therefore an appropriate increase in the nitrogen application rates up to 360 kg n ha 1 helped to improve biomass accumulation in the shoot and its transfer to the grain together with n use efficiency in maize under early sixth leaf stage waterlogging keywords leaf area harvest index nitrogen metabolism root growth zea mays 1 introduction waterlogging wl or flooding often occurs where there is substantial precipitation poor soil drainage and significant fluctuations in the high groundwater level ren et al 2016 it is estimated that waterlogged areas account for 12 of the world s cropping areas li et al 2006 along with global climate change wl is becoming a worldwide natural disaster the magnitude and frequency of wl have been predicted to increase particularly in high and mid latitude regions herzog et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 including the huanghuaihai plain and the jianghan plain in china ren et al 2017 wl leads to greater reliance on anaerobic respiration seen in the accumulation of toxins in the rhizosphere including hydrogen sulfide h2s and ferrous sulfide fes this toxic environment leads to reduced absorption of minerals and beneficial trace elements resulting in poor growth and development of the root system ren et al 2016 zhang et al 2021 moreover wl inhibits the accumulation and distribution of both biomass and nitrogen n in different organs leading to reduced n use efficiency and poor grain yields wu et al 2015 ren et al 2016 2017 wl is also known to produce adverse effects on plant physiological processes including decreased cell permeability zhang et al 2021 reduced root activity and respiration kaur et al 2020 and antioxidant inhibition resulting in the closure of stomata reduced chlorophyll concentrations in the leaves and a decline in the net photosynthetic rate p n zhou and oosterhuis 2012 tian et al 2021 the reduction in plant growth after wl may be related to lower levels of soil oxygen which limit both carbon and n metabolism and adversely affect the availability of soil nutrients including n herzog et al 2016 ren et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 in particular waterlogged plants suffer from n deficiency due to the enhanced denitrification and leaching of mobile nutrients limami et al 2014 kaur et al 2020 together with reduced rates of n mineralization haddad et al 2013 caused by the excessive soil moisture the application of n fertilizer is important for regulating crop growth and yield even under wl conditions e g wu et al 2015 men et al 2020 increasing the application of n fertilizer can augment the activities of superoxide dismutase peroxidase and catalase raise the p n transpiration rate stomatal conductance and yield components ears per ha kernels per ear 1000 kernel weight resulting in enhanced maize grain yield after six days of wl at the sixth leaf v6 stage tian et al 2021 n supplementation was also found to improve chlorophyll content in leaves shoot biomass and n accumulation in winter rape men et al 2020 and maize wu et al 2015 under a short term wl for 3 7 d a high rate of n fertilization 312 kg n ha 1 resulted in less reduction in maize yield compared to a low n rate 45 kg n ha 1 after 72 h of wl stress 20 reduction vs 35 reduction respectively kaur et al 2020 also an early study showed that the application of n fertilizer at the tenth leaf growth stage has beneficial effects on maize growth after three days of wl initiated at the v6 stage kaur et al 2017 additional foliar n fertilization improved root respiratory activity leaf chlorophyll content p n and increased nitrate reductase nr activity of waterlogged wheat resulting in improved plant nutrition and a relatively high grain yield wu et al 2013 2014 however an early study showed that the application of high n concentrations lowered n uptake subsequently reducing biomass and the redistribution of carbohydrate stores from the vegetative organs to the grain resulting in a more significant grain yield loss in wheat under post anthesis wl jiang et al 2008 in addition guo et al 2010 illustrated that appropriate n application 240 kg n ha 1 increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes and reduced lipid peroxidation thus improving the wl resistance of cotton whereas excessive n supply 480 kg n ha 1 behaved in the opposite way therefore the n fertilizer application rate should be carefully considered to reduce stress damage and promote the recovery of crop growth after the relief of wl stress although maize requires large amounts of water it is not resistant to wl the average rainfall on the jianghan plain is about 500 800 mm during the maize growing season usually covering the period between the v6 and maturity moreover the early growth stages of maize are susceptible to wl stress ren et al 2016 in addition shoot biomass accumulation and its distribution and n utilization are closely related to the crop yield arduini et al 2019 qi et al 2020a however to the best of our knowledge the effects of n fertilizer on maize shoot biomass accumulation and its distribution n uptake and use efficiency under wl and the physiological mechanisms underlying this remain largely unknown therefore the objectives of this study were to investigate 1 the shoot biomass accumulation and its distribution in response to varying n rates and 2 the effects on shoot n uptake n use efficiency nue nitrogen partial factor productivity pfpn and nitrogen harvest index nhi of maize under wl at the v6 stage various agronomic and physiological traits including leaf area index chlorophyll spad value nr activity harvest index root biomass and root length density were determined we hypothesized that appropriate increases in the n application rates improve root and leaf growth increasing the shoot biomass and its distribution to grain as well as nue in wl conditions to compensate for n loss due to wl the results will provide an essential scientific basis for the efficient management of n fertilization and further understanding of the physiological mechanisms underlying n fertilization in alleviating wl stress in maize 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site a two year 2018 and 2019 field experiment was performed at the agrometeorological experimental station of jingzhou city central china latitude 30 21 n longitude112 31 e altitude 30 m the station is located in a region with a typical subtropical monsoon climate zone with mean annual precipitation annual sunshine duration and annual temperature of 1095 mm 1718 h and 16 5 respectively the accumulated temperature above 10 c is 5094 9 5294 3 c the soil texture at the experimental site is calcareous alluvial the basic physicochemical properties of the experimental soil are summarized in table 1 the average air temperature precipitation and hours of sunshine during the maize growing season are shown in table 2 2 2 experimental design a split plot experimental plan was established using water regime as the main plots and n rate as subplots there were three replications for each treatment subplot the plot size was 16 m2 4 m 4 m and polyvinyl chloride pvc boards 4 m 2 3 m were used around the plot inserted to 2 0 m below the soil surface and with 0 4 m remaining above the ground to prevent water movement water regimes included ww or a relative soil mass water content of 70 85 field capacity fc as a reasonable control during the maize grown season ww and wl where a 2 3 cm water layer was retained for 6 d above the soil surface at the v6 stage the wl was initiated 41 days after planting dap of the crop in 2018 and 42 dap in 2019 the surface water in the wl plots was removed using a siphon at the end of the wl period and the soil moisture content was gradually reduced to that of the control soil moisture content of ww with a period of 5 7 d the n application rates included 0 n0 90 n1 180 n2 270 n3 and 360 n4 kg n ha 1 which were applied to each water regime the n fertilizer urea n 46 application was split into a basal application 40 on 31 march 2018 and 3 april 2019 and a top dressing fertilization at the twelfth leaf growth stage v12 60 on 25 june 2018 and 28 jun 2019 2 3 crop management the crop management strategies were described in detail by tian et al 2021 briefly ditches were arranged for each subplot to drain excessive water caused by heavy rainfall during the crop growing season excluding the v6 stage of maize under the wl treatment water was pumped onto the wl plots 4 6 times per day to maintain a 2 3 cm layer of free water above the field surface throughout the wl period no irrigation water was added to the maize excluded the wl due to a considerable amount of precipitation across the two experimental years table 2 calcium superphosphate and potash muriate were applied at rates of 329 kg ha 1 p2o5 17 and 300 kg ha 1 k2o 60 respectively before sowing maize cultivar with yidan no 629 was planted with a density of 73 000 plants ha 1 on 1 april 2018 and 4 april 2019 and the crops were harvested on 9 august 2018 and 11 august 2019 2 4 data collection 2 4 1 shoot biomass and its distribution five plants of each plot at the tasseling vt and maturity r6 stages were harvested for biomass determination corresponding to dap 92 and dap 127 in 2018 and dap 91 and dap 129 in 2019 respectively the sampled above ground parts of the plant were split into different components namely the leaf stem sheath and ear and the ear was further separated into the cob and kernel components at the r6 stage all samples were then dried in a drier at 75 0c to a consistent weight and were weighed to determine shoot biomass and calculate its distribution proportion of the related organ to the whole shoot qi et al 2020a 2 4 2 leaf area index lai and spad value leaf area and spad values were determined at the v6 v12 vt silking r1 filling r2 and milk r4 stages of maize corresponding to dap 47 78 92 100 109 and 120 in 2018 and dap 48 79 91 101 110 and 119 in 2019 respectively a portable spad 502 chlorophyll meter minolta camera co japan was used for measuring the spad values a graduated ruler was used for the measurement of leaf length l and leaf width w and the leaf area was calculated following the method of combe 2005 the lai was calculated by the ratio of total plant leaf area to per unit ground area 2 4 3 nitrogen uptake and its utilization and grain yield n concentrations in the mature plants were analyzed using the semi micro kjeldahl method aoac 1984 the shoot n uptake was calculated from the sum of the products of biomass and tissue n contents the nues included the nue the ratio of grain yield to the total amount of n uptake in shoots pfpn the ratio of grain yield to the amount of n application and nhi the ratio of the amount of n in grains to the amount of n in shoot biomass according to ju et al 2015 a dimension of 6 0 m2 in the center of each plot was harvested for grain yield determination adjusted to 14 5 moisture 2 4 4 nitrate reductase nr activity the nr activity from five representative leaves second fully expanded leaves was estimated at the v6 vt and r1 stages corresponding to the same dates as the leaf area measurement according to the method of aslam et al 2001 2 4 5 root sampling root biomass and root length were determined at the r1 and r6 stages on the same days as the shoot biomass measurement a hand driven auger diameter in 10 cm and length in 1 25 m was used for root sampling the samples were collected from 0 to 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm soil depths below the plant the root samples were first rinsed then arranged and floated in a glass container with shallow water and finally scanned using a scanner epson expression 1680 scanner seiko epson corp tokyo japan the root length was analyzed by the winrhizo root analyzer system regent instruments inc quebec canada the scanned seeds were dried at 75 c to a constant weight and weighed 2 5 data analysis the harvest index was calculated as the ratio of grain weight to shoot biomass at the r6 stage root length density rld was calculated as the ratio of root length to the volume of sampling soil the biomass transfer amount bta g plant 1 its transfer rate btr and the contribution rate of bta from vegetative organs to grain gcr were calculated by using eqs 1 3 respectively xu et al 2009 as follows 1 bta biomass in organ at the vt biomass in organ at the 2 biomass transfer rate biomass transfer amount in one organ biomass amount in the organ at the vt 100 3 gcr dta grain dry weight 100 2 6 statistical analysis results were subjected to analysis of variance anova using spss 12 0 software chicago il usa data were arranged in a split split plot design with years allocated as the main plots soil water conditions ww and wl as the sub plots and the n application rates n0 n1 n2 n3 and n4 as the sub subplots three replicates were used duncan s test was used to determine differences between means and p values 0 05 were considered statistically significant 3 results the analysis of variance revealed a significant interaction between soil water condition and n application rates for most of the measured parameters conversely the influence of year and the interactions with year were not significant for any of the variables measured probably because the differences in temperature between 2018 and 2019 were minor table 2 and the maize crops were irrigated when necessary therefore data were pooled and presented across the years steel and torrie 1980 the phenological development of maize was comparable among the different n application rates under the same water regime across the two years however the wl delayed the phenological development of maize and the growth processes from the v6 to r6 stages in wl were 1 2 d longer than those under ww conditions table 3 3 1 shoot biomass at the vt post vt and r6 stages the shoot biomass of the maize was significantly smaller in wl treatment than ww treatment irrespective of n application table 4 the shoot biomass at the vt post vt and r6 stages was significantly reduced in n0 plants compared to other n rates under the two water regimes under ww treatment the shoot biomass increased dramatically with the n application rate up to n3 and then decreased under the n4 under the wl treatment the shoot biomass increased with the n application rate up to n4 and the differences were statistically significant among the different n rates at the r6 stage table 4 3 2 distribution proportion of shoot biomass and harvest index the biomass distribution proportion in the stems and leaves was significantly greater in the wl coupled with n0 treatment than in the other treatments table 5 the ww combined with n3 treatment resulted in the smallest distribution proportion in the stems and leaves the n0 and n1 treatments resulted in a significantly greater distribution proportion in the cob than the other n application rates under the ww the n4 resulted in a significantly lower distribution proportion in the cob than the other n rates under the wl table 5 the biomass distribution proportion in the kernel and the harvest index showed similar variations among the different treatments compared with the shoot biomass at the r6 stage table 5 3 3 shoot biomass transfer and its contribution rate to grain the biomass transfer amount bta its transfer rate btr and the contribution of the bta from the vegetative organs to grain gcr were highest in the leaves followed by the stems and sheaths for all treatments table 6 however the changes in bta btr and gcr were not consistent among the different treatments the bta btr and gcr in leaves stem and sheath were significantly reduced in the wl condition compared to the ww treatment for all n rates both n0 and n1 resulted in decreased bta btr and gcr in the leaves stems and sheaths compared to the other n rates under the ww condition the bta btr and gcr values in the leaves stems and sheaths increased with increasing n application rates under wl the ww condition coupled with n3 or n4 produced the highest bta btr and gcr values in the leaves stems and sheaths while wl combined with n0 resulted in the lowest bta btr and gcr values in the leaves stems and sheaths compared to the other treatments table 6 3 4 nitrate reductase nr activity nitrate reductase nr activities at the v6 vt and r1 stages were significantly lower in the wl than in the ww treatment for each n rate table 7 moreover the nr activity at the v6 was significantly lower in the n0 compared to the other n application rates under the two water regimes the nr activity at the vt and r1 stages among the different treatments showed a similar variation compared with the shoot biomass at the r6 stage table 7 3 5 nitrogen uptake and its utilization n accumulation nhi nue and pfpn were significantly greater in the ww compared to the wl treatment irrespective of the n application rate table 8 nitrogen accumulation increased with increased n application up to n3 and was then maintained under the n4 treatment under the ww condition while accumulation increased under all n applications under wl the nhi and nue increased with the increase in n application rates up to n3 before plateauing at the n4 under both water regimes the pfpn decreased with increasing n application rates to n4 under the ww and decreased in response to increasing n to the n3 followed by a plateau at n4 under the wl 3 6 root length density rld and root biomass in all treatments both the rld and root biomass were reduced significantly from the r1 to r6 growth stages figs 1 and 2 the rld at the r1 stage and root biomass at the r6 stage among the different treatments showed a similar variation compared with the shoot biomass at the r6 stage figs 1 and 2 the rld at the r6 stage and root biomass at the r1 stage increased with the increase in n application up to n3 then decreased at the n4 under the ww and they increased with the increase in n rates up to n3 plateauing at the n4 under the wl figs 1 and 2 4 discussion wl during the early v3 and v6 growth stages resulted in longer term adverse eﬀects on maize growth seen in the continued observation of early leaf senescence reduced n uptake and metabolism and retarded photosynthetic rate during the late growth stages ren et al 2016 2017 in the present study the wl resulted in consistently reduced shoot biomass table 4 accompanied by smaller lai table s1 chlorophyll spad value table s2 and nr activity table 7 at the latter vt and r1 growth stages it has been found that larger leaf areas during the later growth stages of wheat contribute to extended photosynthesis giunta et al 2008 thus the decrease in lai is indicative of reduced photosynthesis in the leaves tian et al 2021 and decreased accumulation of shoot biomass flooding reduced the leaf thylakoids chlorophyll content and leaf water potential possibly accounting for the reduced p n under wl zhang et al 2021 moreover nr is one of the key enzymes in n metabolism controlling the first step of n uptake and utilization liu et al 2017 thus reduced nr activity is likely to affect plant normal n metabolism phukan et al 2016 ren et al 2017 alternatively wl decreased the activities of rubpcase and pepcase ren et al 2018 and reduced contents of soluble sugars and proteins guo et al 2009 in the leaves resulting in an imbalance between carbon and n metabolism zhang et al 2021 and consequently inhibiting the normal photosynthetic functions of the maize leaf in addition the growth and development of above ground plants depend on the acquisition of soil nutrients and water by the root systems fan et al 2016 thus the reduced shoot growth can be attributed to poor performance of the root system after wl ren et al 2016 arduini et al 2019 as shown by the reduced rld fig 1 and root biomass fig 2 under the wl the inhibition of root growth can be explained as follows first it is widely observed that anaerobiosis occurs when the soil is saturated with water hossain and uddin 2011 zhang et al 2021 tissues that consume large amounts of oxygen such as actively dividing root meristems are the first victims of the depleted oxygen and their cells rapidly enter an energy crisis condition loreti et al 2016 resulting in a decrease of root respiration that may also lead to the death of the root cells zhang et al 2021 second additional adverse conditions caused by wl in soil are the accumulation of co2 ethylene and biochemically reduced compounds in the root rhizosphere leading to inhibited root growth ren et al 2016 third root growth can also be limited by low soil n availability tian et al 2021 as a consequence of denitrification and n leaching due to wl kaur et al 2020 we also observed that a high rate of n application as in n4 enhanced shoot biomass table 4 under the wl this is in line with previous findings on cotton guo et al 2010 winter wheat wu et al 2015 and winter rapeseed liu et al 2017 suggesting that appropriate elevations in n fertilization can enhance plant tolerance to wl stress the reasons can be explained as follows first higher n applications applied before wl promotes root vigor after wl stress zhou and oosterhuis 2012 here 40 of n fertilizer was used as the basal application the remaining 60 of the n fertilizer was used as top dressing at the v12 stage after wl second higher n treatments enhance soil n availability after wl tian et al 2021 resulting in the greater rld fig 1 and root biomass fig 1 values which contribute to the improved efficiency of soil nutrient and water absorption by the roots skinner et al 1998 fan et al 2016 thus improving the plant n nutrition status qi et al 2020b the enhanced chlorophyll spad value table s2 and nr activity table 7 confirmed this wl induces soil n deficiency due to denitrification ammonia volatilization and n leaching limami et al 2014 nguyen et al 2018 in the present study the n3 produced the greatest shoot biomass table 4 under the ww but not under the wl the n4 did which supports our hypothesis that wl causes considerable n loss third the enhanced lai at the higher n treatments at the latter growth stages under the wl table s1 established a solid foundation for high shoot biomass qi et al 2020a in support supplemental n ameliorated the photosynthetic rate by promoting the synthesis of photosynthetic enzymes inhibiting abscisic acid production and stimulating gibberellic and cytokinin synthesis ma et al 2008 in addition compared with the n0 treatment the n fertilization treatments mainly increased shoot biomass of the waterlogged maize at the post vt stages rather than the vt stages table 4 which is consistent with the findings of an earlier study that n fertilization only increased the wheat biomass at the post flowering stage liang et al 2020 kernel crop n requirement characteristics usually low at the early growth stage and up to peak at the flowering or filling stage may partially account for this difference in the present study the maize was waterlogged for 6 d at the v6 stage after the v6 stage the maize plants enter a vigorous growth period their n requirements increase rapidly jing et al 2013 resulting in positive eﬀects on shoot growth following increased application of n fertilizer thus we concluded that supplementary n fertilization improves maize growth mainly during the tasseling to maturity periods after wl s early sixth leaf stage the harvest index is used to indicate the ability of the plant to transport source organ assimilates to sinks wl decreased the degree of biomass transfer from the vegetative organs to the grain before flowering liang et al 2020 which has been found to adversely affect the average growth and development of summer maize e g lowering the root shoot ratio ren et al 2016 leading to a smaller crop harvest index ren et al 2016 arduini et al 2019 liang et al 2020 in the present study the wl decreased the harvest index by lowering the distribution proportion of biomass in the kernel table 5 and contribution rate of biomass transfer amount from vegetative organs to grain gcr in leaves stems and sheaths table 6 this could be related to the reduced amounts of carbon in the ears 53 1 due to reduced activity of sucrose cleaving enzymes and p n caused by wl at an early v3 growth stage of maize hu et al 2021 combined with the previous study and our present results it can be concluded that early sixth leaf stage wl inhibits the plant s ability to transport carbohydrates from source to sink organs in maize however masoni et al 2016 reported that wl did not influence the harvest index in barley at the tillering stage the percentage dry weight reduction in the straw and roots was approximately the same as that in the grain moreover increasing gcr is an effective way to improve grain yield in kernel crops yin et al 2016 qi et al 2020a the present study found that a high n application rate as in n4 helps to improve the distribution proportion of biomass in the kernel table 5 and gcr in leaves stems and sheaths table 6 and consequently to produce a greater harvest index table 5 under the wl this could be related to relatively high soil n availability resulting from high n fertilizer treatments tian et al 2021 which enhances the transfer rate of carbohydrates from source to sink xu et al 2009 yin et al 2016 alternatively supplementary application of n fertilizer increase activities of superoxide dismutase peroxidase and catalase and thus alleviating the oxidative membrane damage caused by wl men et al 2020 and improving the transportation and distribution of photoassimilates wu et al 2015 also appropriate increases in the n supply after wl prolongs the vigorous growth of the root system guo et al 2010 and retards leaf senescence wu et al 2014 thus enhancing the transfer of assimilated nutrients from the vegetative organs to the grain li et al 2020 these results highlight the critical role of gcr in improving maize grain yield under wl and provide some helpful information to understanding the mechanism underlying n mediated enhancement of plant tolerance to wl stress wl stress adversely affects n uptake and utilization by plants wu et al 2015 arduini et al 2019 due to one or more of the following effects low soil n availability nguyen et al 2018 inhibited root growth ren et al 2016 ploschuk et al 2018 or the energy crisis caused by anaerobiosis in the root environment which impairs the active transport of nitrate against its electrochemical gradient pang et al 2007 zhang et al 2021 thus it is not easy to determine whether the lower n availability to roots and or the lower n translocation to the shoot is responsible for the reduced root and shoot growth arduini et al 2019 in this study the wl significantly decreased shoot n accumulation and nue table 8 this could be related to wl related decreases in the root absorption area active absorption area root bleeding rate and consequently root activity ren et al 2016 alternatively wl may delay the processes of plant growth ren et al 2014 table 3 inhibit root growth figs 1 and 2 and accelerate root senescence ren et al 2016 resulting in a lack of n nutrient supplies at the start of the reproductive growth of maize wu et al 2018 moreover wl reduced the soil nitrate content required for plant growth and yield by altering the ammonia oxidizing communities nguyen et al 2018 resulting in a significant reduction of ears per ha kernels per ear and 1000 kernel weight ultimately leading to reduced grain yields tian et al 2021 finally nhi reflects the distribution of n in grains to the total n in the shoot biomass at the r6 stage jin et al 2012 it has been shown that wl reduces grain n accumulation ren et al 2017 resulting in the decreased nhi table 8 indicating that early sixth leaf stage wl reduced the distribution of n in grains to the total n in maize in addition n0 application resulted in the lowest shoot biomass table 4 and n accumulation table 8 suggesting that the n0 treatment further accelerated maize n deficiency under wl conditions this was associated with the combined stress of wl and n deficiency which significantly inhibited normal plant growth tian et al 2021 as shown by the reduced lai table s1 chlorophyll spad value table s2 nr activity table 7 and nhi table 8 in the present study in support ren et al 2017 demonstrated that the reduced n accumulation was attributed to a reduction in the activities of key n metabolism enzymes nr glutamine glutamate synthase and glutamate dehydrogenase in maize due to wl thus we argue that both lower soil n availability and lower n translocation account for the reduced shoot growth and n utilization of maize under early sixth leaf stage wl however this is contrary to the findings of arduini et al 2019 that wl affected the growth of oat roots in a pot culture as well as n translocation to the shoot rather than soil n availability which was supported by enhanced net uptake rates of plant n after wl this contradiction may be explained by differences in wl duration test crops and experimental conditions kaur et al 2020 a relatively low fertilizer n loss has been observed in pot culture compared with field conditions wang et al 2019 which may be partially responsible for the normal supply of soil n in the former the effect of n management strategies on crop nue and the underlying mechanisms under drought conditions have been widely reported e g li et al 2009 lu et al 2021 however there is a lack of information on the effects of n fertilization on the nue of waterlogged crops and its possible causes liu et al 2017 in the present study we found that appropriate increases in n application help to improve nr activity table 7 shoot n accumulation and nhi table 8 accompanied by enhanced grain yields tian et al 2021 and consequently a relatively high nue the wl induced n deficiency both in soil and plant as described above it is widely accepted that increases in the n supply will significantly improve maize yields when the soil n content is low under ww conditions li et al 2020 moreover additional n fertilizer application known as rescue n has been shown to improve root respiratory activity and p n kaur et al 2020 antioxidant defense system and osmoregulation tian et al 2021 which contributed to improving n metabolism and uptake in waterlogged plants wu et al 2018 in addition the enhanced rld at higher n treatments under wl was responsible for the improved nue as n uptake by maize plants was positively correlated with rld zhang et al 2005 qi et al 2020b nitrogen partial factor productivity pfpn is an important indicator used to reflect the productivity of n fertilizers maintaining a large crop yield with relatively high pfpn is vital for both production and environmental protection past studies have shown that the n fertilizer s productivity usually decreases with increased rates of fertilization li et al 2019 zou et al 2020 indicating relatively lower economic returns under high n supply conditions in agreement with this although the pfpn was reduced significantly with increasing rates of n application under the two water regimes table 8 the decrement in the pfpn was reduced under wl this indicated that a high n rate as in n4 produces more economic benefits for maize production under early stage wl undoubtedly a high n application rate as in n4 poses a relatively high risk of n loss by ammonia volatilization leaching and denitrification of nitrate n resulting in the waste of agricultural resources and problems of environmental pollution ju et al 2009 thus these issues merit further study under wl conditions 5 conclusions early sixth leaf stage waterlogging for 6 d inhibited root root length density and root biomass and leaf lai growth at the post tasseling stages resulting in reduced shoot biomass and nitrogen accumulation as well as their distribution to the grain parts of the plants resulting in a low nitrogen use efficiency in maize moreover increasing the nitrogen fertilization rates partially ameliorated the adverse effects of early stage waterlogging on maize shoot biomass accumulation distribution and nitrogen use efficiency by improving both root and leaf growth the improved harvest index at a high level of nitrogen treatment 360 kg n ha 1 under early stage waterlogging was associated with an improved proportion of biomass distribution in the kernel and improved biomass transfer from the vegetative organs to the grain therefore we conclude that appropriate increases in the nitrogen application rate up to 360 kg n ha 1 could improve shoot biomass and distribution and nitrogen use efficiency in maize under early stage waterlogging the results also suggest the physiological mechanisms underlying plant shoot biomass and distribution and nitrogen
