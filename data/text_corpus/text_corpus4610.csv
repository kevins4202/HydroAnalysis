23050,understanding the ship manoeuvring behaviour in waves is of major interest to avoid ship responses which can lead to hazardous scenarios waves may impair the ship s manoeuvrability by inducing hull forces and moments and by changing the propeller and rudder performance these are fundamental problems which require further attention the present work aims to provide a better insight on the problem of manoeuvring in waves by investigating the change of the hull propeller and rudder hydrodynamic behaviour with respect to calm water coastal waves and finite water depths representative of the belgian coastal zone of the north sea are chosen for the present study these correspond to scenarios where ultra large container ships ulcs manoeuvre in waves and shallow water the study includes experiments conducted with a scale model of an ulcs in the towing tank for manoeuvres in confined water at flanders hydraulics research in cooperation with ghent university different combinations of ship forward speeds wave amplitudes and periods drift angles propeller rates and rudder angles are considered moreover numerical results for the wave induced forces moments and motions have been computed with the software package hydrostar and the results are compared with the experiments to evaluate their accuracy nomenclature symbols b breadth of ship m c 33 c 55 restoring coefficient in

manoeuvres in the close proximity to ports it will encounter several environmental phenomena such as wind waves and shallow water determining the influence of such phenomena on the ship s manoeuvrability is of great relevance in order to guarantee safe ship operations during the past decades the analysis of manoeuvring has mainly been focused to environmental conditions corresponding to calm water and infinite water depth studies as such have been restricted to cover horizontal motions only at most they have been extended to include roll motion for the case of finite water depth the study requires additional considerations for instance disregarding the effects of the ship s vertical motions from the study is not an option in such cases the ship experiences a significant induced sinkage and trim due to the squat phenomenon bear in mind that the limited water depth will in addition change the overall hydrodynamic behaviour of the forces and moments acting on the ship as reported in vantorre and eloot 1996 and ittc 2002 models for such scenarios finite water depth including the vertical motions are rather scarce in literature to the authors best knowledge one of the most recent work addressing this problem can be found in delefortrie et al 2016a b in practice when the ship manoeuvres in coastal areas approaching or leaving a port it will also navigate under the influence of waves considering the already restricted water depth and the induced squat effects the estimation of wave effects on the manoeuvring behaviour seems of critical importance manoeuvring in waves has been a constant topic of research during the last years in literature several works addressing the problem can be found among them one can refer to the works of hirano et al 1980 bailey et al 1998 ueno et al 2003 skejic and faltinsen 2008 and seo and kim 2011 more recent work has been performed by cura hochbaum and uharek 2016 papanikolaou et al 2016 tello ruiz et al 2016a zhang et al 2017 and wang et al 2018 in general the approaches can be summarised in two main groups the unified method and the two time scale method the unified method attempts to integrate the fluid phenomena in a more general formulation valid for manoeuvring as well as for seakeeping see for instance bailey et al 1998 and sutulo and guedes soares 2006 the two time scale method is a more practical approach as it does not consider any further modification of the manoeuvring model obtained from calm water analysis this approach considers waves effects given by the mean second order wave forces and moments only e g skejic and faltinsen 2008 seo and kim 2011 yasukawa and nakayama 2009 and papanikolaou et al 2016 in spite of the fundamental differences between the unified and the two time scale method it is important to mention that both evaluate wave forces similarly computing them as in seakeeping studies investigations of the influence of manoeuvring parameters such as the drift angle and yaw velocity on the wave induced forces and motions as estimated from seakeeping studies are limited in literature in general the drift angle influence is simply disregarded from the analysis works addressing this problem numerically can be found in sutulo and guedes soares 2008 and yasukawa et al 2010 and experimentally in yasukawa and adnan 2006 in the latter the influence of drift angle on the wave induced ship motions was evaluated for a container ship s 175 in deep water and waves longer than the ship length λ l p p for such characteristics the influence of the drift angle was found of relevant importance another important concern is with respect to the propeller and rudder performance under the effect of waves in literature it is surprising to notice that in spite of their significant importance for manoeuvres only few works can be found e g nakamura and naito 1977 bhattacharyya 2015 and taskar 2017 the latter are also dedicated to study the problem in deep water in shallow water however relevant research information is scarce it is important to point out that in literature the problem of manoeuvring in waves is mostly addressed in deep water there is limited information on how waves will affect the ship s manoeuvring behaviour in coastal zones where the limited water depth is a fundamental problem to the authors the study of manoeuvring in waves in shallow water deserves a great attention because it is in such areas where ships are mostly expected to manoeuvre in waves initial results on this topics were presented in tello ruiz et al 2016a a more extensive analysis was required to have a better view of the influence of waves on the ship s manoeuvrability 1 2 motivation and objectives of the present work it has been stressed above that there is a lack of research studies addressing the problem of manoeuvring in waves in restricted water depths the current methods have been mostly developed for deep water scenarios and their fundamental assumptions require yet further investigation to determine their applicability to restricted water depths but first before any further discussion is introduced it is necessary to mention that in the present study the definition of restricted water depths is adopted from pianc 2012 where the classification is made based on the water depth h to ship s draft amidships t m ratio h t m for shallow water this varies between 1 2 and 1 5 for medium deep water this ratio takes the values from 1 5 to 3 and for deep water larger values than 3 the present study is restricted to the limit between shallow to medium deep water depth where the ratio h t m takes the values of 1 5 corresponding to an under keel clearance of 50 of the ship s draft considering the stated above the main objective of the present study is to investigate the effect of waves on the ship s manoeuvrability in a finite water depth the investigation will be conducted mainly experimentally and to some extent numerically to investigate the effect of waves on the manoeuvring of the ship the study is conducted by comparing results obtained from tests in calm water and in waves the parameters evaluated are forces and moments propeller thrust and torque coefficients wake fraction at the propeller and rudder as well as the thrust deduction factor further investigations are also required to study the main assumptions such as the superposition of the wave forces to the manoeuvring forces commonly used in the unified and two time scale method for the present study a selected number of ship speeds drift angles wave lengths and amplitudes have been used during experiments tests were conducted in head and following waves with a scale model of an ulcs the ship speeds the drift angles and the wave main characteristics are chosen to be representative for the conditions commonly encounter in the belgian coastal zone of the north sea in these navigational areas the ship is expected to manoeuvre with slow to moderate speed and with a limited drift angles β less than 20 deg for the present study numerical estimations have also been computed for the first and second order wave forces and moments this has been performed with the software package hydrostar hydrostar uses a 3d boundary element method that incorporates the speed effects by employing the so called encounter frequency approximation based on the use of the green function associated to the encounter frequency bureau veritas 2012 2 the mathematical model 2 1 modular approach the governing equations of motion describing the ship s rigid body motions in six degrees of freedom are given by 1 m u v r w q x g r 2 q 2 y g p q r z g p r q m v w p u r x g p q r y g p 2 r 2 z g q r p w u q v p x g p r q y g q r p z g p 2 q 2 h x q h z

fixed coordinate system b frame of which the origin is fixed amidships with its x axis positive towards the bow the y axis positive to starboard and the z axis positive downwards the left hand side of eq 1 is defined by the ship s mass m the position of the centre of gravity x g y g and z g the ship velocities u v w p q r the angular momenta h x h y h z and their respective derivatives dotted variables the right hand side of eq 1 are the forces and moments f which are modularly expressed as 2 f f h f r f p f w the subscripts h r p and w stand for hull rudder propeller and wave contributions respectively eq 2 is expressed assuming that no other external forces and moments act on the ship except for waves the wave induced forces f w can be further subdivided as 3 f w f d f fk f 2 nd f 1 st f 2 nd where f d f fk and f 2 nd refer to the diffraction force the froude krylov force and the mean second order wave forces forces arising due to f d and f fk are also known as first order forces f 1 st the hull forces f h are assumed to be composed of two sub components as 4 f h f s f h where f s comprise forces arising from viscous lift and cross flow phenomena which can be treated independently from the body oscillation forces f h for practical purposes and considering the main objective of the present work f h will not be further discussed 2 2 steady forces f s f s can be expressed as a tabular and modular function this is partially adapted from delefortrie et al 2016a as 5 f s x s y s k s n s 1 2 ρ l p p s t m x β x γ x χ y β y γ y χ k β k γ k χ n β n γ n χ u 2 v 2 u 2 v p 2 v 2 v p 2 0 0 k v 0 where ρ l p p and t m are the water density the ship s length and draft respectively the exponent s of l p p is 1 for forces x h y h z h and 2 for moments k h m h n h the variables u and v stand for the ship s longitudinal and lateral velocity components respectively and the reference lateral velocity v p due to yaw motion is given by 6 v p r l p p 2 r being the ship s yaw angular velocity in eq 5 β γ and χ refer to the hydrodynamic angles defined by 7 β arctan v u γ arctan v p u χ arctan v p v twelve terms in eq 5 i e x β to n χ are tabular coefficients expressed as function of the hydrodynamic angles β γ and χ they express phenomena such as lift drag and cross flow effects which are relevant for the horizontal forces and moments eq 5 accounts for a 4dof analysis only the vertical responses are included separately steady forces in heave and the moment in pitch are evaluated by squat formulations for the sinkage z l c f and trim θ l c f as derived by tuck 1966 they are determine assuming squat effects as a result of a hydrostatically changing equilibrium position taking into account that the longitudinal centre of flotation lcf is small compared to the ship length l p p lcf l p p these steady forces and moments expressed at the b frame s origin can be found by 8 z t u h β z c 33 l p p 2 t u h m t u h β m c 55 l p p 3 t u h where is the ship displacement and the l p p is the ship length between perpendiculars c 33 and c 55 are respectively the restoring coefficients in heave and pitch the tuck s parameter t u h can be estimated by 9 t u h f r h 2 1 f r h 2 f r h is the depth based froude number given by the ratio v g h where g is the acceleration of gravity and h the water depth the viscous roll moment k v in eq 5 can be modelled as in ikeda et al 1977 and himeno 1981 by a linear k v p and nonlinear k v p p viscous damping coefficients and is a function of the roll angular velocity p 10 k v k v p p k v p p p p 2 3 wave forces f w because of the limited drift angles considered in the analysis the application of theoretical works developed for seakeeping can be applied to the manoeuvring problem without a significant change in the formulations for instance in skejic 2008 a strip theory formulation has been used and the drift angle has been disregarded other numerical methods such as panel methods can also be used under the same considerations 2 3 1 general discussion when the ship moves with a forward speed the analysis requires further approximations it is in general accepted to assume that the velocity potential φ x y z t can be separated into two main parts 11 φ x y z t v x ϕ s x y z ϕ t x y z e i ω e t a steady contribution v x ϕ s x y z due to the forward motions of the ship and a time dependent part associated with the incident wave system and the unsteady body motion ϕ t x y z e i ω e t ϕ t is the complex amplitude of the unsteady potential and ω e is the frequency of encounter in the moving reference h frame x y z moving horizontally parallel to the mean water surface with the ship at constant speed further simplification is achieved by assuming the unsteady potential ϕ t expressed as a linear superposition of the incident wave potential ϕ i the diffraction potential ϕ d and the radiation potential ξ j ϕ j 12 ϕ t ϕ i ϕ d j 1 6 ξ j ϕ j 2 3 2 linear wave forces the total hydrodynamic forces and moments on the ship hull can be obtained by the integration of the linearised pressure around the mean wetted surface s 0 the pressure can be obtained based on the bernoulli principle 13 p ρ ϕ t 1 2 ϕ 2 g z considering only linear terms in the taylor expansion of eq 13 the pressure taking into account the newman kelvin relationship is given by 14 p ρ i ω e v x ϕ t e i ω e t ρ g ξ 3 ξ 4 y ξ 5 x e i ω e t the second term in eq 14 gives the restoring terms which can be computed separately finally the total hydrodynamic forces and moments can be computed by 15 f hj h ρ s 0 n j i ω v x ϕ t d s e i ω e t replacing the potential ϕ t by its approximation given in eq 12 the forces and moments can be decomposed in the components given by the radiation diffraction forces and froude krylov effects considering only the last two the first order wave forces and moments can be expressed as 16 f 1 stj h ρ s 0 n j i ω v x ϕ i ϕ d d s e i ω e t 2 3 3 second order wave forces the main purpose of the present method is to account for a more correct estimation of the pressure forces and to integrate them on the actual hull s wetted surface s to address the problem the taylor expansion for the ship motions pressure forces and velocity potential φ are used thus φ can be expressed as 17 φ φ 0 ε φ 1 ε 2 φ 2 o ε 3 where ε 1 expressions similar to eq 17 can be derived for the ship motions x forces f and moments m in eq 17 the superscripts 0 1 and 2 refer to the static terms the first order terms and the second order terms respectively in journée and massie 2001 φ is shown to be decomposed in 18 φ φ i 1 φ d 1 φ r 1 φ d 2 φ i 2 the second order potential φ 2 in eq 17 is given by 19 φ 2 φ d 2 φ i 2 φ d 2 is an ordinary potential and φ i 2 is as a second order equivalent to φ i 1 the remaining part of the analysis is to compute the pressure and to integrate it on the actual hull wetted surface from the bernoulli eq 13 and assuming again a taylor expansion but now up to the second order only the pressure can be written as 20 p p 0 ε p 1 ε 2 p 2 where p 0 p 1 and p 2 are respectively given by 21 p 0 ρ g z 0 0 22 p 1 ρ g z 0 1 ρ ϕ 1 t 23 p 2 ρ 1 2 ϕ 1 2 ρ 2 ϕ 2 t 2 ρ x 1 ϕ 1 t the forces and moments on the actual surface s can then be obtained by 24 f s p n d s 25 m s p x n d s where n is the normal to the surface s considering only the diffraction and the incident wave potentials in eq 21 to eq 25 the second order wave forces and moments can be found 2 3 4 numerical solution different methods to estimate the hydrodynamic forces and moments based on potential theory are available in literature de caluwé 2015 investigated the accuracy of the estimations of these forces using several software packages wamit hydrostar and seaway in his study special attention was given to the mean second order forces and moments the comparison against experimental results obtained for a containership and a tanker showed that the results from hydrostar had a better agreement and convergence analysis hence in the present study wave forces will be further estimated using hydrostar only hydrostar is a 3d numerical panel method capable of estimating the radiation problem and the first and second order wave forces and moments to account for the ship s forward speed an approximation is made based on the green function associated with the encounter frequency to evaluate the second order effects in hydrostar three different methods are available the near field method the far field method and the middle field method bureau veritas 2012 in the present work the near field method will be used because of its faster convergence when the forward speed problem is included de caluwé 2015 2 4 propeller forces 2 4 1 thrust and torque coefficients the thrust t and torque q can be studied by first evaluating their respective thrust k t and torque k q coefficients 26 k t t ρ d 4 n 2 27 k q q ρ d 5 n 2 where n is the propeller rate d is the propeller diameter and ρ is the density of the water to obtain the wake fraction k t and k q are plotted as function of the apparent advance ratio 28 j v n d where v is the ship forward speed the wake fraction can be obtained by thrust identity w t or by torque identity w q with their respective k t and k q coefficients given by 29 w t 1 j j w q 1 j j both can be expressed as function of the apparent hydrodynamic advance angle ε 30 ε atan j 0 7 π 2 4 2 thrust deduction factor the propeller hull interaction is investigated by computing the increase of ship resistance as a fraction of the propeller thrust this term is commonly known as the thrust deduction fraction and is given by 31 t t f r t where f is the longitudinal force measured during tests with the propeller action t is the propeller thrust and r positive is the ship resistance 2 5 rudder forces to investigate the rudder behaviour in waves the wake fraction at the rudder w r will be further discussed w r can be identified from the longitudinal x r and lateral y r forces on the rudder by a similar process as the thrust and torque identity method the forces on the rudder in the b frame x r and y r can be related to the lift and drag coefficients by 32 x r ρ 2 a r v r 2 c d r α r c o s β r c l r α r s i n β r 33 y r ρ 2 a r v r 2 c d r α r s i n β r c l r α r c o s β r where v r is local speed defined by longitudinal u r and transversal v r velocities 34 v r u r 2 v r 2 and β r is the corresponding local drift angle defined by 35 β r arctan v r u r the lift c l r and drag c d r coefficients are functions of the effective inflow angle α r 36 α r δ r δ 0 β r where δ 0 is a correction of flow asymmetry see delefortrie 2007 and it is defined at the condition where the normal force satisfy 37 δ 0 δ r f n r 0 the transversal velocity at the rudder can be obtained by 38 v r k h r v r x r where k h r and x r refer to the straightening coefficient and the longitudinal position of the rudder axis respectively more details on these parameters can be found in vantorre 1989 eloot 2006 and delefortrie 2007 the longitudinal speed u r can be estimated by a weighting average of the free stream u r 0 and the flow due to the propeller action u r p as 39 u r η u r p 2 1 η u r 0 2 where η d p h r is the propeller diameter d to rudder height h r ratio the speed u r p can be estimated by means of momentum theory brix 1993 40 u r p u r 0 k m u p 1 8 k t π j 2 1 where u p is the flow axial velocity at the propeller location and k m is a factor taking into account the propeller jet contraction at the rudder location k t and j are the thrust coefficient and the propeller advance ratio respectively the free stream u r 0 is given by 41 u r 0 u 1 w r the wake fraction at the rudder w r x and w r y can be obtained by applying eq 32 to eq 41 for the x r force and the y r forces respectively and comparing them to the rudder open water characteristics 3 experimental study 3 1 the towing tank the experiments were conducted at the towing tank for manoeuvres in confined water at flanders hydraulics research fhr in antwerp belgium in cooperation with ghent university the towing tank has a total length of 87 5 m a width of 7 0 m and a maximum water depth of 0 5 m because of the presence of the harbour and the wave maker the useful length is limited to 68 0 m see fig 1 for better illustration the towing tank is equipped with a carriage mechanism which consists of a main carriage a lateral carriage a yawing table and a roll mechanism allowing to perform captive tests according to these four degrees of freedom in addition the ship can either be free or fixed in heave and pitch alternatively the roll mechanism also allows free roll so that either 4dof or 3dof captive tests can be performed fully captive and free running model tests can also be performed by using different beam frames attached to the carriage mechanism the towing tank is equipped with a wave generator which can be used to generate regular and irregular long crested waves a more detail discussion on the characteristics of the towing tank can be found in delefortrie et al 2016b during tests the ship s position and orientation along the tank are defined by using two coordinate systems an earth fixed coordinate system o 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 and a body fixed coordinate system o x y z both are north east down ned oriented the longitudinal axis of the earth axes system coincides with the towing tank s centre line and is positive towards the wave maker for the body axis system the longitudinal x axis is aligned with the ship s centreline positive towards the bow for brevity purposes the earth bound and the ship bound axes systems are referred as the e frame and the b frame respectively to define the ship s relative orientation during tests in waves parameters such as wave angle of encounter μ hull drift angle β and ship s heading angle ψ are used see fig 1 notice that the wave angle η relative to the e frame axes is always 180 deg during tests the wave propagation along the tank as well as the waves the ship model encounters must be recorded for this purpose wave gauges were located fixed relative to the carriage wg5 and wg6 and fixed relative to the tank wg1 to wg4 in fig 1 the general arrangement of the wave gauges is shown previous to tests with the ship model wg1 to wg4 were set at the towing tank s centre line y 0 0 m to verify the main wave characteristics without the influence of the ship model 3 2 the ship model model tests were conducted with a 1 90 scale model of an ultra large container ship ulcs the main characteristics are presented in table 1 a profile view of the ship hull is shown in fig 2 notice that in table 1 two different values for the longitudinal position of the centre of gravity x g are given this is because of the two different test types semi captive and fully captive tests which have been conducted with two distinctive beam frames a discussion with respect to these frames will be given in section 4 3 observe however that the difference in x g is very small and can be assumed to be negligible 3 2 1 propeller and rudder appendages the ship model was equipped with a single propeller and a single rudder the propeller geometry was designed according to the wageningen b series with six blades the rudder is a semi balanced design fig 3 show both of them as installed on the model their main particulars are given in table 2 3 3 beam frame units the model tests have been conducted with two different beam frames which connect the ship to the main carriage mechanism the frames are referred to as frame a and frame b and are related to semi captive tests and fully captive tests respectively frame a is commonly used at fhr while frame b has been rented from marin 3 3 1 beam frame a beam frame a comprises a set of two different instruments four load cells lc1x lc1y lc2x and lc2y and four potentiometers p1 to p4 the load cells measure the longitudinal and transversal forces while the potentiometers measure the vertical motions the ship is allowed to freely move in roll and pitch by means of a cardan point while free heave motions are allowed through a vertical guidance fig 4 illustrates the general arrangement of the instrumentation from the load cells lc1 and lc2 records surge and sway forces as well as yaw moments in the b frame can be derived similarly from the records of the potentiometers the motions in heave roll and pitch can be obtained 3 3 2 beam frame b beam frame b is composed of two sub frames both of them connected by six strain gauges s1 to s6 the beam frame installed on the ship model and the general arrangement of the instrumentation used during tests are illustrated in fig 5 the forces in surge sway and heave as well as the moments in roll pitch and yaw expressed on the b frame can be derived from the measurements obtained from the strain gauges and the distances a b and c because of the limited space between the carriage and the model the frame b s centre did not coincide with the b frame s origin hence a distance z c f indicating this position was measured 0 078 m the parameters a b and c were 0 80 m 0 22 m and 1 45 m respectively 3 4 test matrix the experimental program can be separated in two main groups steady straight line tests and harmonic yaw tests both of them have been conducted in calm water and in regular waves with the two different beam frames frame a and frame b almost all tests conducted with frame a were also executed with frame b however because of the limitation due to the squat effects tests at higher speed have only been performed with frame a these tests and other additional ones performed with frame a only are shown in grey shaded areas in the tables below 3 4 1 wave main characteristics seventeen regular waves have been chosen for the present study these waves can be differentiated in two groups as a function of their wave amplitudes ζ a 1 0 m rw1 and 1 35 m rw2 at full scale respectively the wave main particulars are presented in table 3 and have been calculated for a water depth h of 0 218 m 19 6 m full scale corresponding to the ship s keel to tank bottom clearance ukc of 50 of the ship s draft 3 4 2 steady straight line tests steady straight line tests have been conducted with and without the influence of a drift angle β table 4 presents the respective main parameters selected for the experiments such tests can also be performed with different combinations of propeller rates n and rudder angles δ r the selected propeller rates and rudder angles are shown in table 5 the steady tests described above with and without propeller and rudder action have also been tested with the effect of wave action the selected parameters are shown in table 6 and in table 7 3 4 3 harmonic yaw tests harmonic yaw tests have also been conducted with and without drift angle at constant ship speed the yaw velocity r in this case oscillates harmonically as a result of the harmonically changing ship s heading ψ ψ oscillates with a period ψ t and the amplitude ψ a the selected ship speed drift angles as well as the period and amplitude of the harmonic yaw oscillations are shown in table 8 the same harmonic yaw tests described above have also been conducted in head waves but only for two wave lengths λ see table 9 3 5 signal processing analysis 3 5 1 post processing analysis the experimental analysis required first to delimit a region along the tank where the model attains the desired test s characteristics such as constant speed and regular waves an example of this process is better illustrated in fig 6 bottom right figure where the coordinates of the ship s position x 0 y 0 and orientation of the ship with respect to waves μ along the towing thank are displayed observe that from the entire tests only the measurements corresponding to the region designed as tested area are displayed to further proceed with the present study the experimental results required a post processing analysis this has been conducted for all records obtained during tests such as the wave profiles and the forces and moments for the forces and moments a high frequency noise of around 5 hz was first removed by a low band pass filter the signals however required further post processing as noise was also present around the frequencies of interest a new filter was then constructed which was composed based on two band pass filters one focused on the main frequency component ω 1 and the second one focused on the second order components twice ω 1 in fig 7 the two band pass filters are illustrated for the test results shown in fig 6 the analysis for all forces moments and wave profile records required then a fourier analysis by fitting the filtered data to eq 42 this has been conducted by using a least squares method to obtain the eight unknown parameters a 0 a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 a 3 b 3 ω 1 42 f a j b j ω 1 a 0 j 1 3 a j cos j ω 1 t b j sin j ω 1 t where a 0 is the mean the fundamental frequency is given by ω 1 and the amplitude of the harmonics by g j a j 2 b j 2 more details on the present procedure can be found in tello ruiz et al 2016b and more recently in mansuy et al 2017 the resulting signals after the filtering process and the fourier fitting are also shown in fig 6 for comparison 3 5 2 uncertainty analysis an uncertainty analysis has been conducted only for the steady tests performed with the model fully captive frame b it is important to mention that the present uncertainty analysis only addresses the contribution due to the precision of the measurements bias sources of uncertainty have not been accounted for due to the complexity of the model set up and the experiments nevertheless the present results can be considered as representative of the errors in the measurements table 10 and table 11 present the respective uncertainty estimations for the forces and moments it is important to mention that taking into consideration the large number of parameters involved in the analysis only nine runs per test have been conducted these number or runs are however considered sufficient for the present purposes from tables 10 and 11 it can be observed that only surge forces and roll moments present the largest uncertainty values both of around 4 at the lower speed at higher speeds these magnitudes decrease the latter is also observed for the other forces and moments it is important to mention that even though smaller magnitudes of roll moment were measured their uncertainties remain smaller thus indicating at least for the steady tests that the present results are reliable the uncertainties presented in tables 10 and 11 are assumed to be representative for the other tests studied in the present work an extension of the uncertainty analysis was not feasible in the scope of the present work 4 results and discussion 4 1 first order forces and moments the results obtained for the first order forces in surge and heave as well as for the first order pitch moment are presented in fig 8 and fig 9 for two different speeds respectively in both figures fully captive test results are shown for head and following waves with and without the influence of the drift angle β in addition the numerical results computed with hydrostar hs have also been displayed for comparison bear in mind that hs results do not take into account the influence of β from figs 8 and 9 it can be observed that in general the results obtained at different drift angles coincide with each other which indicates that the drift angle influence on the first order quantities is rather small this holds true for both head and following waves there is a slightly larger difference for the lower speed but this becomes smaller at the higher speed from the comparison against hydrostar results it can be observed that estimations with hydrostar are better for head waves than for following waves in the latter hydrostar overestimate the results in the shorter wave length range at higher speeds in spite of the observed discrepancies it can be stated that in general the agreement of the results obtained with hydrostar and the experiments are quite satisfactory 4 2 ship motion to further investigate the ship behaviour in waves the ship motions in heave and pitch during semi captive tests are examined the results for four different speeds in head and following waves are plotted in figs 10 13 notice also that in these figures the ship motion responses estimated with hydrostar have been displayed roll motions are not shown in the figures below their smaller orders of magnitude notice that the wave angle of encounter μ is approximately 180 deg have not allowed distinction from noise on the gauges hence they were omitted from figs 10 13 it can be seen that the influence of drift angles on heave and pitch motions is present but negligibly small this holds true for head and following waves as well as for low and higher speeds observe also that the incorporation of the drift angle induces slightly larger differences on the motions than on the first order forces and moments section 5 1 comparing the results with the numerical estimations obtained from hydrostar slightly better estimations are obtained in head waves than in following waves similarly the predictions seem better at lower speeds than at higher speeds and for pitch motion than for heave motion in spite of these discrepancies it can be stated that for practical purposes the numerical estimation seems a good approximation of the experimental results for the entire range of ship speeds and wave lengths considered within the present analysis 4 3 steady components in order to investigate the effects of waves on the mean forces and moments the mean values obtained from tests with and without waves in head and following waves are plotted in figs 14 19 notice that all results are plotted dimensionless as functions of the square of the speed v 2 for figs 14 17 and as functions of tuck s parameter tu h for figs 18 and 19 forces and moments are non dimensionalised by 0 5 ρl p p t m v 2 and 0 5 ρl p p 2 t m v 2 respectively except for heave forces and pitch moments which are given dimensionless according to eq 8 bear in mind that the above expressions for the non dimensionalisation are commonly used in manoeuvring in calm water hence the present arrangement of the results should help to easily identify the influence of waves on the mean forces and moments and to determine their relative importance from fig 14 the surge forces in calm water cw present a slightly varying magnitude as the speed increases this is also observed as function of the drift angle comparing the cw results with the respective ones obtained in head waves rw1 and rw2 a significant variation in the dimensionless magnitudes is obtained at lower speeds at higher speeds however such change is rather small and appears to be negligible the latter is also observed when a larger wave amplitude rw2 in top left plot in fig 14 is considered with respect to the influence of the drift angle on wave effects no significant change in the mean surge forces is observed for the case of following waves see fig 15 the differences obtained between mean surge forces in cw and waves are similar to the ones discussed for head waves in fig 14 however it is important to mention that for the case of head waves and following waves as expected an increase and a decrease of the ship s resistance is observed respectively for the case of the mean sway force roll and yaw moment in head waves see fig 16 and in following waves see fig 17 the influence of waves on the mean forces and moments seems also negligible except at lower speeds for the case of heave force and pitch moment in figs 18 and 19 wave effects appear to be larger than for the cases of surge and sway forces and the roll and yaw moments this is seen by the larger spread of the results obtained during test in waves head and following notice also that the pitch moment presents the larger spread of results obtained in waves indicating a larger influence due to waves the differences obtained for heave force and pitch moment between tests in cw and in waves however reduce as the ship speed increases 4 3 1 influence of the wave length bear in mind that the differences observed between the mean forces and moments obtained in cw and in waves see figs 14 19 have been pointed out for the dimensionless quantities it should be stressed that although in such representation wave effects were found to be insignificant especially at higher speeds their magnitudes might still be of relevance for manoeuvring hence to have a different perspective of the importance of wave effects their relative magnitudes mean values in waves subtracted from the mean values in cw are shown in fig 20 and fig 21 for two different speeds only in these figures in addition the cw magnitudes are also presented see right y axis on the figures different from the previous cases in figs 20 and 21 results are plotted as function of ship length to wave length ratio l pp λ this in order to have a better overall view of the influence of the main wave characteristics that have the largest influence on the ship behaviour in contrast to the cw results from figs 20 and 21 it can be observed that wave effects see left y axis on the figures in surge forces are the most significant with values up to 20 of the cw magnitude see right y axis at lower speeds however this is reduced to less than 10 when the ship speed increases for the case of sway and heave forces in general the influence of waves is also less than 10 of the cw values and this is even lower than 2 5 for heave forces at the higher speed see fig 21 with respect to the pitch moment only a relevant influence around 16 of the cw values is observed at longer wave lengths l p p λ 2 and at the lower speed but this is also reduced to less than 5 at the higher speed regarding the roll and yaw moments it can be stated that from all the quantities studied they are the least influenced by waves showing an insignificant change in their magnitudes in comparison with the ones obtained from tests in cw from figs 20 and 21 it can be stated that with respect to the drift angles and the wave length their influence on the wave effects for all forces and moments is in general small and can be considered negligible this in spite of the larger influence obtained for pitch moment at longer wave lengths recall that the present analysis is focused on coastal waves in such areas waves with shorter wave lengths are mostly predominant 4 3 2 added wave resistance prediction with hydrostar to further investigate the effect of waves the results for the added wave resistance r aw also represented by δ x obtained for tests conducted at zero drift angle and four different forward speeds have been presented in fig 22 in addition numerical results computed with the software hydrostar have also been displayed for comparison test results obtained for the larger wave amplitude are presented only for two different speeds in fig 23 from fig 22 it can be seen that the raw for the case of lower speed and the ships fully captive subscript fix present larger oscillations in its magnitudes in contrast to the results observed for the ship semi captive subscript free this can be attributed to the larger noise in frame b model fully fixed and smaller magnitudes obtained for the r aw the latter can be confirmed when looking to the results obtained in fig 23 where less fluctuation in the raw values is observed for the fully captive tests at larger wave amplitudes larger raw magnitudes are expected thus less significance of the noise in the results in spite of the differences obtained for raw at smaller wave amplitudes between the fully captive and semi captive tests it can be observed that both results see figs 22 and 23 slightly differ with respect to each other the latter indicates a less significant effect of the ship motions on the estimation of raw hence they could be neglected from the analysis this would simplify the problem for the estimation of raw however one should bear in mind that an approximation as such will not be satisfactory for the longer wave length range from figs 22 and 23 one can also observe that the computed values with hydrostar present larger discrepancies with the experiments at higher speeds the latter however cannot be addressed to the less accurate prediction of the ship motions because they have shown a good agreement in figs 10 13 but could be associated to the speed approximation used in hydrostar 4 4 superposition taking into consideration the observations made above further studies are conducted by comparing the time series obtained in waves with the ones obtained by the superposition of the wave forces and moments first and second order obtained from hydrostar to the calm water magnitudes the results are presented in fig 24 and fig 25 for one forward speed with and without the influence of the drift angle respectively in addition the calm water results are also displayed for a better insight from figs 24 and 25 it can be stated that in general for all force and moments the superposition approach offers a good approximation of the test results this holds true even for the case when a drift angle has been considered see fig 25 in spite of some minor discrepancies obtained for the particular case of roll moments the superposed values show an out of phase with respect to the test results for both figures the latter however can be addressed due to a slightly difference in the vertical position of the frame b s centre measured with respect to ship s waterline notice that compared to the results discussed earlier in this case larger incoming wave angles μ have been attained of around 202 5 deg for the tests with the drift angle observe also that the calm water cw forces and moments in red see figs 24 and 25 attain values which are similar to the mean of the respective quantities obtained in waves this means that the magnitudes of the mean second order wave effects have a small influence the latter however should not be considered as a reason to disregard the second order wave effects but instead as one to support the application of the superposition approach 4 5 propeller the results obtained from the experiments conducted with the propeller action in calm water and in head waves have been expressed in terms of thrust kt and torque kq coefficients and the torque wq and thrust wt wake fractions the respective results are shown in fig 26 from fig 26 with respect to the thrust and torque coefficients it is observed that the difference between the results obtained in calm water and in waves are rather small for all combinations of the apparent advance number j the variations expressed in terms of the wake fractions confirm these observations hence for the tests under consideration it can be stated that the influence of coastal waves on the propeller behaviour is rather negligible notice that wq presents negative values which are rather unrealistic but this is mainly due to the consideration of the open water characteristics adopted in the present study which corresponds to deep water although the open water characteristics corresponding to the 50 ukc is desired it should be stressed that for the present purpose which is to estimate the effect of waves on the propeller behaviour the differences between the calm water and the wave results are more relevant that the real wake fraction magnitudes hence the importance of the present analysis 4 6 thrust deduction factor the investigation of the thrust deduction factor t has also been conducted in the present study it is important to mention that the analysis does not necessarily correspond to the self propulsion point the values for the thrust deduction factor have been obtained from towing tanks tests with the model semi captive frame a the results for three different wave lengths are presented in fig 27 as a function of the apparent hydrodynamic angle ε it can be seen from fig 27 that the thrust deduction factor remains approximately constant as a function of ε this is observed for both results in calm water and in waves comparing both an insignificant change in their magnitudes with respect to each other can be noticed hence it can be stated that within the limits of shorter wave lengths the variation of the thrust deduction factors is indifferent to the wave action 4 7 rudder to investigate the effect of waves on the rudder performance the wake fraction deduced from the rudder x wrx and y wry force components have been obtained from tests in calm water and in head waves the results for both test types in calm water and in waves are presented for three different wave lengths in fig 28 it is important to mention that for the tests presented in fig 28 the parameters η k m and v r take the values of 0 71 0 95 and 0 respectively v r is zero because the currently discussed test results have only been obtained from test without drift angle β or yaw motion from fig 28 one can observe that the wake fraction wrx is larger than the ones obtained for wry both appear to change slightly with ε and always remain smaller than 1 except for wrx at the lowest ε with respect to wave effects on the wake fractions they do not seem significantly important hence the behaviour of the rudder can be considered as the same in waves as the ones obtained in calm water once more bear in mind that these observations are only restricted to the combinations of rudder angles shorter wave lengths and smaller wave amplitudes which are however representative of the operational conditions expected in coastal areas 5 conclusions an extensive experimental study has been conducted to investigate the manoeuvring behaviour of an ulcs in coastal waves the ship behaviour and environmental characteristics were chosen to represent the most common scenarios encountered when approaching or leaving a port for an ulcs this represents operating in the range of shorter waves lengths compared to the ship length from the analysis of the first order forces and moments no significant influence on the results was obtained when the hull drift angle was included these results were further compared to numerical estimations by hydrostar it has been found that such forces and moments can be estimated with a good approximation similar observations were made for the case of the wave induced ship motions from the comparison of the mean forces and moments obtained in calm water and in waves it has been found that the effect of waves are of great relevance up to 20 of the calm water values for surge forces at low speeds when the ship speed increases however the effect of waves become less significant with respect to the wave length the influence of ship motions and drift angles no significant dependence has been observed only a slight increase in the sway forces was noticed taking into consideration the first and second order wave forces and moments and the calm water contributions the superposition approach has also been investigated the results show that even when the drift angles are incorporated in the analysis such an approximation can be considered as appropriate to investigate manoeuvring in waves with respect to the propeller and rudder behaviour in waves the investigation revealed throughout the evaluation of the thrust and torque coefficients and the wake fractions that for the chosen wave characteristics and propeller rates and rudder angles wave effects seem negligible similar findings have been obtained for the thrust deduction factor acknowledgments the present work is performed in the frame of project wl 2013 47 scientific support for investigating the manoeuvring behaviour of ships in waves granted to ghent university by flanders hydraulics research antwerp department of mobility and public works flemish government belgium for the numerical calculations a hydrostar licence was put at the main author s disposal by bureau veritas through their antwerp and paris offices which is highly appreciated 
23050,understanding the ship manoeuvring behaviour in waves is of major interest to avoid ship responses which can lead to hazardous scenarios waves may impair the ship s manoeuvrability by inducing hull forces and moments and by changing the propeller and rudder performance these are fundamental problems which require further attention the present work aims to provide a better insight on the problem of manoeuvring in waves by investigating the change of the hull propeller and rudder hydrodynamic behaviour with respect to calm water coastal waves and finite water depths representative of the belgian coastal zone of the north sea are chosen for the present study these correspond to scenarios where ultra large container ships ulcs manoeuvre in waves and shallow water the study includes experiments conducted with a scale model of an ulcs in the towing tank for manoeuvres in confined water at flanders hydraulics research in cooperation with ghent university different combinations of ship forward speeds wave amplitudes and periods drift angles propeller rates and rudder angles are considered moreover numerical results for the wave induced forces moments and motions have been computed with the software package hydrostar and the results are compared with the experiments to evaluate their accuracy nomenclature symbols b breadth of ship m c 33 c 55 restoring coefficient in

manoeuvres in the close proximity to ports it will encounter several environmental phenomena such as wind waves and shallow water determining the influence of such phenomena on the ship s manoeuvrability is of great relevance in order to guarantee safe ship operations during the past decades the analysis of manoeuvring has mainly been focused to environmental conditions corresponding to calm water and infinite water depth studies as such have been restricted to cover horizontal motions only at most they have been extended to include roll motion for the case of finite water depth the study requires additional considerations for instance disregarding the effects of the ship s vertical motions from the study is not an option in such cases the ship experiences a significant induced sinkage and trim due to the squat phenomenon bear in mind that the limited water depth will in addition change the overall hydrodynamic behaviour of the forces and moments acting on the ship as reported in vantorre and eloot 1996 and ittc 2002 models for such scenarios finite water depth including the vertical motions are rather scarce in literature to the authors best knowledge one of the most recent work addressing this problem can be found in delefortrie et al 2016a b in practice when the ship manoeuvres in coastal areas approaching or leaving a port it will also navigate under the influence of waves considering the already restricted water depth and the induced squat effects the estimation of wave effects on the manoeuvring behaviour seems of critical importance manoeuvring in waves has been a constant topic of research during the last years in literature several works addressing the problem can be found among them one can refer to the works of hirano et al 1980 bailey et al 1998 ueno et al 2003 skejic and faltinsen 2008 and seo and kim 2011 more recent work has been performed by cura hochbaum and uharek 2016 papanikolaou et al 2016 tello ruiz et al 2016a zhang et al 2017 and wang et al 2018 in general the approaches can be summarised in two main groups the unified method and the two time scale method the unified method attempts to integrate the fluid phenomena in a more general formulation valid for manoeuvring as well as for seakeeping see for instance bailey et al 1998 and sutulo and guedes soares 2006 the two time scale method is a more practical approach as it does not consider any further modification of the manoeuvring model obtained from calm water analysis this approach considers waves effects given by the mean second order wave forces and moments only e g skejic and faltinsen 2008 seo and kim 2011 yasukawa and nakayama 2009 and papanikolaou et al 2016 in spite of the fundamental differences between the unified and the two time scale method it is important to mention that both evaluate wave forces similarly computing them as in seakeeping studies investigations of the influence of manoeuvring parameters such as the drift angle and yaw velocity on the wave induced forces and motions as estimated from seakeeping studies are limited in literature in general the drift angle influence is simply disregarded from the analysis works addressing this problem numerically can be found in sutulo and guedes soares 2008 and yasukawa et al 2010 and experimentally in yasukawa and adnan 2006 in the latter the influence of drift angle on the wave induced ship motions was evaluated for a container ship s 175 in deep water and waves longer than the ship length λ l p p for such characteristics the influence of the drift angle was found of relevant importance another important concern is with respect to the propeller and rudder performance under the effect of waves in literature it is surprising to notice that in spite of their significant importance for manoeuvres only few works can be found e g nakamura and naito 1977 bhattacharyya 2015 and taskar 2017 the latter are also dedicated to study the problem in deep water in shallow water however relevant research information is scarce it is important to point out that in literature the problem of manoeuvring in waves is mostly addressed in deep water there is limited information on how waves will affect the ship s manoeuvring behaviour in coastal zones where the limited water depth is a fundamental problem to the authors the study of manoeuvring in waves in shallow water deserves a great attention because it is in such areas where ships are mostly expected to manoeuvre in waves initial results on this topics were presented in tello ruiz et al 2016a a more extensive analysis was required to have a better view of the influence of waves on the ship s manoeuvrability 1 2 motivation and objectives of the present work it has been stressed above that there is a lack of research studies addressing the problem of manoeuvring in waves in restricted water depths the current methods have been mostly developed for deep water scenarios and their fundamental assumptions require yet further investigation to determine their applicability to restricted water depths but first before any further discussion is introduced it is necessary to mention that in the present study the definition of restricted water depths is adopted from pianc 2012 where the classification is made based on the water depth h to ship s draft amidships t m ratio h t m for shallow water this varies between 1 2 and 1 5 for medium deep water this ratio takes the values from 1 5 to 3 and for deep water larger values than 3 the present study is restricted to the limit between shallow to medium deep water depth where the ratio h t m takes the values of 1 5 corresponding to an under keel clearance of 50 of the ship s draft considering the stated above the main objective of the present study is to investigate the effect of waves on the ship s manoeuvrability in a finite water depth the investigation will be conducted mainly experimentally and to some extent numerically to investigate the effect of waves on the manoeuvring of the ship the study is conducted by comparing results obtained from tests in calm water and in waves the parameters evaluated are forces and moments propeller thrust and torque coefficients wake fraction at the propeller and rudder as well as the thrust deduction factor further investigations are also required to study the main assumptions such as the superposition of the wave forces to the manoeuvring forces commonly used in the unified and two time scale method for the present study a selected number of ship speeds drift angles wave lengths and amplitudes have been used during experiments tests were conducted in head and following waves with a scale model of an ulcs the ship speeds the drift angles and the wave main characteristics are chosen to be representative for the conditions commonly encounter in the belgian coastal zone of the north sea in these navigational areas the ship is expected to manoeuvre with slow to moderate speed and with a limited drift angles β less than 20 deg for the present study numerical estimations have also been computed for the first and second order wave forces and moments this has been performed with the software package hydrostar hydrostar uses a 3d boundary element method that incorporates the speed effects by employing the so called encounter frequency approximation based on the use of the green function associated to the encounter frequency bureau veritas 2012 2 the mathematical model 2 1 modular approach the governing equations of motion describing the ship s rigid body motions in six degrees of freedom are given by 1 m u v r w q x g r 2 q 2 y g p q r z g p r q m v w p u r x g p q r y g p 2 r 2 z g q r p w u q v p x g p r q y g q r p z g p 2 q 2 h x q h z

fixed coordinate system b frame of which the origin is fixed amidships with its x axis positive towards the bow the y axis positive to starboard and the z axis positive downwards the left hand side of eq 1 is defined by the ship s mass m the position of the centre of gravity x g y g and z g the ship velocities u v w p q r the angular momenta h x h y h z and their respective derivatives dotted variables the right hand side of eq 1 are the forces and moments f which are modularly expressed as 2 f f h f r f p f w the subscripts h r p and w stand for hull rudder propeller and wave contributions respectively eq 2 is expressed assuming that no other external forces and moments act on the ship except for waves the wave induced forces f w can be further subdivided as 3 f w f d f fk f 2 nd f 1 st f 2 nd where f d f fk and f 2 nd refer to the diffraction force the froude krylov force and the mean second order wave forces forces arising due to f d and f fk are also known as first order forces f 1 st the hull forces f h are assumed to be composed of two sub components as 4 f h f s f h where f s comprise forces arising from viscous lift and cross flow phenomena which can be treated independently from the body oscillation forces f h for practical purposes and considering the main objective of the present work f h will not be further discussed 2 2 steady forces f s f s can be expressed as a tabular and modular function this is partially adapted from delefortrie et al 2016a as 5 f s x s y s k s n s 1 2 ρ l p p s t m x β x γ x χ y β y γ y χ k β k γ k χ n β n γ n χ u 2 v 2

variables u and v stand for the ship s longitudinal and lateral velocity components respectively and the reference lateral velocity v p due to yaw motion is given by 6 v p r l p p 2 r being the ship s yaw angular velocity in eq 5 β γ and χ refer to the hydrodynamic angles defined by 7 β arctan v u γ arctan v p u χ arctan v p v twelve terms in eq 5 i e x β to n χ are tabular coefficients expressed as function of the hydrodynamic angles β γ and χ they express phenomena such as lift drag and cross flow effects which are relevant for the horizontal forces and moments eq 5 accounts for a 4dof analysis only the vertical responses are included separately steady forces in heave and the moment in pitch are evaluated by squat formulations for the sinkage z l c f and trim θ l c f as derived by tuck 1966 they are determine assuming squat effects as a result of a hydrostatically changing equilibrium position taking into account that the longitudinal centre of flotation lcf is small compared to the ship length l p p lcf l p p these steady forces and moments expressed at the b frame s origin can be found by 8 z t u h β z c 33 l p p 2 t u h m t u h β m c 55 l p p 3 t u h where is the ship

f r h 2 1 f r h 2 f r h is the depth based froude number given by the ratio v g h where g is the acceleration of gravity and h the water depth the viscous roll moment k v in eq 5 can be modelled as in

because of the limited drift angles considered in the analysis the application of theoretical works developed for seakeeping can be applied to the manoeuvring problem without a significant change in the formulations for instance in skejic 2008 a strip theory formulation has been used and the drift angle has been disregarded other numerical methods such as panel methods can also be used under the same considerations 2 3 1 general discussion when the ship moves with a forward speed the analysis requires further approximations it is in general accepted to assume that the velocity potential φ x y z t can be separated into two main parts 11 φ x y z t v x ϕ s x y z ϕ t x y z e i ω e t a steady contribution v x ϕ s x y z due to the forward motions of the ship and a time dependent part associated with the incident wave system and the unsteady body motion ϕ t x y z e i ω e t ϕ t is the complex amplitude of the unsteady potential and ω e is the frequency of encounter in the moving reference h frame x y z moving horizontally parallel to the mean water surface with the ship at constant speed further simplification is achieved by assuming the unsteady potential ϕ t expressed as a linear superposition of the incident wave potential ϕ i the diffraction potential ϕ d and the radiation potential ξ j ϕ j 12 ϕ t ϕ i ϕ d j 1 6 ξ j ϕ j 2 3 2 linear wave forces the total hydrodynamic forces and moments on the ship hull can be obtained by the integration of the linearised pressure around the mean wetted surface s 0 the pressure can be obtained based on the bernoulli principle 13 p ρ ϕ t 1 2 ϕ 2 g z considering only linear terms in the taylor expansion of eq 13 the pressure taking into account the newman kelvin relationship is given by 14 p ρ i ω e v x ϕ t e i ω e t ρ g ξ 3 ξ 4 y ξ 5 x e i ω e t the second term in eq 14 gives the restoring terms which can be computed separately finally the total hydrodynamic forces and moments can be computed by 15 f hj h ρ s 0 n j i ω v x ϕ t d s e i ω e t replacing the potential ϕ t by its approximation given in eq 12 the forces and moments can be decomposed in the components given by the radiation diffraction forces and froude krylov effects considering only the last two the first order wave forces and moments can be expressed as 16 f 1 stj h ρ s 0 n j i ω v x ϕ i ϕ d d s e i ω e t 2 3 3 second order wave forces the main purpose of the present method is to account for a more correct estimation of the pressure forces and to integrate them on the actual hull s wetted surface s to address the problem the taylor expansion for the ship motions pressure forces and velocity potential φ are used thus φ can be expressed as 17 φ φ 0 ε φ 1 ε 2 φ 2 o ε 3 where ε 1 expressions similar to eq 17 can be derived for the ship motions x forces f and moments m in eq 17 the superscripts 0 1 and 2 refer to the static terms the first order terms and the second order terms respectively in journée and massie 2001 φ is shown to be decomposed in 18 φ φ i 1 φ d 1 φ r 1 φ d 2 φ i 2 the second order potential φ 2 in eq 17 is given by 19 φ 2 φ d 2 φ i 2 φ d 2 is an ordinary potential and φ i 2 is as a second order equivalent to φ i 1 the remaining part of the analysis is to compute the pressure and to integrate it on the actual hull wetted surface from the bernoulli eq 13 and assuming again a taylor expansion but now up to the second order only the pressure can be written as 20 p p 0 ε p 1 ε 2 p 2 where p 0 p 1 and p 2 are respectively given by 21 p 0 ρ g z 0 0 22 p 1 ρ g z 0 1 ρ ϕ 1 t 23 p 2 ρ 1 2 ϕ 1 2 ρ 2 ϕ 2 t 2 ρ x 1 ϕ 1 t the forces and moments on the actual surface s can then be obtained by 24 f s p n d s 25 m s p x n d s where n is the normal to the surface s considering only the diffraction and the incident wave potentials in eq 21 to eq 25 the second order wave forces and moments can be found 2 3 4 numerical solution different methods to estimate the hydrodynamic forces and moments based on potential theory are available in literature de caluwé 2015 investigated the accuracy of the estimations of these forces using several software packages wamit hydrostar and seaway in his study special attention was given to the mean second order forces and moments the comparison against experimental results obtained for a containership and a tanker showed that the results from hydrostar had a better agreement and convergence analysis hence in the present study wave forces will be further estimated using hydrostar only hydrostar is a 3d numerical panel method capable of estimating the radiation problem and the first and second order wave forces and moments to account for the ship s forward speed an approximation is made based on the green function associated with the encounter frequency to evaluate the second order effects in hydrostar three different methods are available the near field method the far field method and the middle field method bureau veritas 2012 in the present work the near field method will be used because of its faster convergence when the forward speed problem is included de caluwé 2015 2 4 propeller forces 2 4 1 thrust and torque coefficients the thrust t and torque q can be studied by first evaluating their respective thrust k t and torque k q coefficients 26 k t t ρ d 4 n 2 27 k q q ρ d 5 n 2 where n is the propeller rate d is the propeller diameter and ρ is the density of the water to obtain the wake fraction k t and k q are plotted as function of the apparent advance ratio 28 j v n d where v is the ship forward speed the wake fraction can be obtained by thrust identity w

7 π 2 4 2 thrust deduction factor the propeller hull interaction is investigated by computing the increase of ship resistance as a fraction of the propeller thrust this term is commonly known as the thrust deduction fraction and is given by 31 t t f r t where f is the longitudinal force measured during tests with the propeller action t is the propeller thrust and r positive is the ship resistance 2 5 rudder forces to investigate the rudder behaviour in waves the wake fraction at the rudder w r will be further discussed w r can be identified from the longitudinal x r and lateral y r forces on the rudder by a similar process as the thrust and torque identity method the forces on the rudder in the b frame x r and y r can be related to the lift and drag coefficients by 32 x r ρ 2 a r v r 2 c

2 and β r is the corresponding local drift angle defined by 35 β r arctan v r u r the lift c l r and drag c d r coefficients are functions of the effective inflow angle α r 36 α r δ r δ 0 β r where δ 0 is a correction of flow asymmetry see delefortrie 2007 and it is defined at the condition where the normal force satisfy 37 δ 0 δ r f n r 0 the transversal velocity at the rudder can be obtained by 38 v r k h r v r x r where k h r and x r refer to the straightening coefficient and the longitudinal position of the rudder axis respectively more details on these parameters can be found in vantorre 1989 eloot 2006 and delefortrie 2007 the longitudinal speed u r can be estimated by a weighting average of the free stream u r 0 and the flow due to the propeller action u r p as 39 u r η u r p 2 1 η u r 0 2 where η d p h r is the propeller diameter d to rudder height h r ratio the speed u r p can be estimated by means of momentum theory brix 1993 40 u r p u r 0 k m u p 1 8 k t π j 2 1 where u p is the flow axial velocity at the propeller location and k m is a factor taking into account the propeller jet contraction at the rudder location k t and j are the thrust coefficient and the propeller advance ratio respectively the free stream u r 0 is given by 41 u r 0 u 1 w r the wake fraction at the rudder w r x and w r y can be obtained by applying eq 32 to eq 41 for the x r force and the y r forces respectively and comparing them to the rudder open water characteristics 3 experimental study 3 1 the towing tank the experiments were conducted at the towing tank for manoeuvres in confined water at flanders hydraulics research fhr in antwerp belgium in cooperation with ghent university the towing tank has a total length of 87 5 m a width of 7 0 m and a maximum water depth of 0 5 m because of the presence of the harbour and the wave maker the useful length is limited to 68 0 m see fig 1 for better illustration the towing tank is equipped with a carriage mechanism which consists of a main carriage a lateral carriage a yawing table and a roll mechanism allowing to perform captive tests according to these four degrees of freedom in addition the ship can either be free or fixed in heave and pitch alternatively the roll mechanism also allows free roll so that either 4dof or 3dof captive tests can be performed fully captive and free running model tests can also be performed by using different beam frames attached to the carriage mechanism the towing tank is equipped with a wave generator which can be used to generate regular and irregular long crested waves a more detail discussion on the characteristics of the towing tank can be found in delefortrie et al 2016b during tests the ship s position and orientation along the tank are defined by using two coordinate systems an earth fixed coordinate system o 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 and a body fixed coordinate system o x y z both are north east down ned oriented the longitudinal axis of the earth axes system coincides with the towing tank s centre line and is positive towards the wave maker for the body axis system the longitudinal x axis is aligned with the ship s centreline positive towards the bow for brevity purposes the earth bound and the ship bound axes systems are referred as the e frame and the b frame respectively to define the ship s relative orientation during tests in waves parameters such as wave angle of encounter μ hull drift angle β and ship s heading angle ψ are used see fig 1 notice that the wave angle η relative to the e frame axes is always 180 deg during tests the wave propagation along the tank as well as the waves the ship model encounters must be recorded for this purpose wave gauges were located fixed relative to the carriage wg5 and wg6 and fixed relative to the tank wg1 to wg4 in fig 1 the general arrangement of the wave gauges is shown previous to tests with the ship model wg1 to wg4 were set at the towing tank s centre line y 0 0 m to verify the main wave characteristics without the influence of the ship model 3 2 the ship model model tests were conducted with a 1 90 scale model of an ultra large container ship ulcs the main characteristics are presented in table 1 a profile view of the ship hull is shown in fig 2 notice that in table 1 two different values for the longitudinal position of the centre of gravity x g are given this is because of the two different test types semi captive and fully captive tests which have been conducted with two distinctive beam frames a discussion with respect to these frames will be given in section 4 3 observe however that the difference in x g is very small and can be assumed to be negligible 3 2 1 propeller and rudder appendages the ship model was equipped with a single propeller and a single rudder the propeller geometry was designed according to the wageningen b series with six blades the rudder is a semi balanced design fig 3 show both of them as installed on the model their main particulars are given in table 2 3 3 beam frame units the model tests have been conducted with two different beam frames which connect the ship to the main carriage mechanism the frames are referred to as frame a and frame b and are related to semi captive tests and fully captive tests respectively frame a is commonly used at fhr while frame b has been rented from marin 3 3 1 beam frame a beam frame a comprises a set of two different instruments four load cells lc1x lc1y lc2x and lc2y and four potentiometers p1 to p4 the load cells measure the longitudinal and transversal forces while the potentiometers measure the vertical motions the ship is allowed to freely move in roll and pitch by means of a cardan point while free heave motions are allowed through a vertical guidance fig 4 illustrates the general arrangement of the instrumentation from the load cells lc1 and lc2 records surge and sway forces as well as yaw moments in the b frame can be derived similarly from the records of the potentiometers the motions in heave roll and pitch can be obtained 3 3 2 beam frame b beam frame b is composed of two sub frames both of them connected by six strain gauges s1 to s6 the beam frame installed on the ship model and the general arrangement of the instrumentation used during tests are illustrated in fig 5 the forces in surge sway and heave as well as the moments in roll pitch and yaw expressed on the b frame can be derived from the measurements obtained from the strain gauges and the distances a b and c because of the limited space between the carriage and the model the frame b s centre did not coincide with the b frame s origin hence a distance z c f indicating this position was measured 0 078 m the parameters a b and c were 0 80 m 0 22 m and 1 45 m respectively 3 4 test matrix the experimental program can be separated in two main groups steady straight line tests and harmonic yaw tests both of them have been conducted in calm water and in regular waves with the two different beam frames frame a and frame b almost all tests conducted with frame a were also executed with frame b however because of the limitation due to the squat effects tests at higher speed have only been performed with frame a these tests and other additional ones performed with frame a only are shown in grey shaded areas in the tables below 3 4 1 wave main characteristics seventeen regular waves have been chosen for the present study these waves can be differentiated in two groups as a function of their wave amplitudes ζ a 1 0 m rw1 and 1 35 m rw2 at full scale respectively the wave main particulars are presented in table 3 and have been calculated for a water depth h of 0 218 m 19 6 m full scale corresponding to the ship s keel to tank bottom clearance ukc of 50 of the ship s draft 3 4 2 steady straight line tests steady straight line tests have been conducted with and without the influence of a drift angle β table 4 presents the respective main parameters selected for the experiments such tests can also be performed with different combinations of propeller rates n and rudder angles δ r the selected propeller rates and rudder angles are shown in table 5 the steady tests described above with and without propeller and rudder action have also been tested with the effect of wave action the selected parameters are shown in table 6 and in table 7 3 4 3 harmonic yaw tests harmonic yaw tests have also been conducted with and without drift angle at constant ship speed the yaw velocity r in this case oscillates harmonically as a result of the harmonically changing ship s heading ψ ψ oscillates with a period ψ t and the amplitude ψ a the selected ship speed drift angles as well as the period and amplitude of the harmonic yaw oscillations are shown in table 8 the same harmonic yaw tests described above have also been conducted in head waves but only for two wave lengths λ see table 9 3 5 signal processing analysis 3 5 1 post processing analysis the experimental analysis required first to delimit a region along the tank where the model attains the desired test s characteristics such as constant speed and regular waves an example of this process is better illustrated in fig 6 bottom right figure where the coordinates of the ship s position x 0 y 0 and orientation of the ship with respect to waves μ along the towing thank are displayed observe that from the entire tests only the measurements corresponding to the region designed as tested area are displayed to further proceed with the present study the experimental results required a post processing analysis this has been conducted for all records obtained during tests such as the wave profiles and the forces and moments for the forces and moments a high frequency noise of around 5 hz was first removed by a low band pass filter the signals however required further post processing as noise was also present around the frequencies of interest a new filter was then constructed which was composed based on two band pass filters one focused on the main frequency component ω 1 and the second one focused on the second order components twice ω 1 in fig 7 the two band pass filters are illustrated for the test results shown in fig 6 the analysis for all forces moments and wave profile records required then a fourier analysis by fitting the filtered data to eq 42 this has been conducted by using a least squares method to obtain the eight unknown parameters a 0 a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 a 3 b 3 ω 1 42 f a j b j ω 1 a 0 j 1 3 a j cos j ω 1 t b j sin j ω 1 t where a 0 is the mean the fundamental frequency is given by ω 1 and the amplitude of the harmonics by g j a j 2 b j 2 more details on the present procedure can be found in tello ruiz et al 2016b and more recently in mansuy et al 2017 the resulting signals after the filtering process and the fourier fitting are also shown in fig 6 for comparison 3 5 2 uncertainty analysis an uncertainty analysis has been conducted only for the steady tests performed with the model fully captive frame b it is important to mention that the present uncertainty analysis only addresses the contribution due to the precision of the measurements bias sources of uncertainty have not been accounted for due to the complexity of the model set up and the experiments nevertheless the present results can be considered as representative of the errors in the measurements table 10 and table 11 present the respective uncertainty estimations for the forces and moments it is important to mention that taking into consideration the large number of parameters involved in the analysis only nine runs per test have been conducted these number or runs are however considered sufficient for the present purposes from tables 10 and 11 it can be observed that only surge forces and roll moments present the largest uncertainty values both of around 4 at the lower speed at higher speeds these magnitudes decrease the latter is also observed for the other forces and moments it is important to mention that even though smaller magnitudes of roll moment were measured their uncertainties remain smaller thus indicating at least for the steady tests that the present results are reliable the uncertainties presented in tables 10 and 11 are assumed to be representative for the other tests studied in the present work an extension of the uncertainty analysis was not feasible in the scope of the present work 4 results and discussion 4 1 first order forces and moments the results obtained for the first order forces in surge and heave as well as for the first order pitch moment are presented in fig 8 and fig 9 for two different speeds respectively in both figures fully captive test results are shown for head and following waves with and without the influence of the drift angle β in addition the numerical results computed with hydrostar hs have also been displayed for comparison bear in mind that hs results do not take into account the influence of β from figs 8 and 9 it can be observed that in general the results obtained at different drift angles coincide with each other which indicates that the drift angle influence on the first order quantities is rather small this holds true for both head and following waves there is a slightly larger difference for the lower speed but this becomes smaller at the higher speed from the comparison against hydrostar results it can be observed that estimations with hydrostar are better for head waves than for following waves in the latter hydrostar overestimate the results in the shorter wave length range at higher speeds in spite of the observed discrepancies it can be stated that in general the agreement of the results obtained with hydrostar and the experiments are quite satisfactory 4 2 ship motion to further investigate the ship behaviour in waves the ship motions in heave and pitch during semi captive tests are examined the results for four different speeds in head and following waves are plotted in figs 10 13 notice also that in these figures the ship motion responses estimated with hydrostar have been displayed roll motions are not shown in the figures below their smaller orders of magnitude notice that the wave angle of encounter μ is approximately 180 deg have not allowed distinction from noise on the gauges hence they were omitted from figs 10 13 it can be seen that the influence of drift angles on heave and pitch motions is present but negligibly small this holds true for head and following waves as well as for low and higher speeds observe also that the incorporation of the drift angle induces slightly larger differences on the motions than on the first order forces and moments section 5 1 comparing the results with the numerical estimations obtained from hydrostar slightly better estimations are obtained in head waves than in following waves similarly the predictions seem better at lower speeds than at higher speeds and for pitch motion than for heave motion in spite of these discrepancies it can be stated that for practical purposes the numerical estimation seems a good approximation of the experimental results for the entire range of ship speeds and wave lengths considered within the present analysis 4 3 steady components in order to investigate the effects of waves on the mean forces and moments the mean values obtained from tests with and without waves in head and following waves are plotted in figs 14 19 notice that all results are plotted dimensionless as functions of the square of the speed v 2 for figs 14 17 and as functions of tuck s parameter tu h for figs 18 and 19 forces and moments are non dimensionalised by 0 5 ρl p p t m v 2 and 0 5 ρl p p 2 t m v 2 respectively except for heave forces and pitch moments which are given dimensionless according to eq 8 bear in mind that the above expressions for the non dimensionalisation are commonly used in manoeuvring in calm water hence the present arrangement of the results should help to easily identify the influence of waves on the mean forces and moments and to determine their relative importance from fig 14 the surge forces in calm water cw present a slightly varying magnitude as the speed increases this is also observed as function of the drift angle comparing the cw results with the respective ones obtained in head waves rw1 and rw2 a significant variation in the dimensionless magnitudes is obtained at lower speeds at higher speeds however such change is rather small and appears to be negligible the latter is also observed when a larger wave amplitude rw2 in top left plot in fig 14 is considered with respect to the influence of the drift angle on wave effects no significant change in the mean surge forces is observed for the case of following waves see fig 15 the differences obtained between mean surge forces in cw and waves are similar to the ones discussed for head waves in fig 14 however it is important to mention that for the case of head waves and following waves as expected an increase and a decrease of the ship s resistance is observed respectively for the case of the mean sway force roll and yaw moment in head waves see fig 16 and in following waves see fig 17 the influence of waves on the mean forces and moments seems also negligible except at lower speeds for the case of heave force and pitch moment in figs 18 and 19 wave effects appear to be larger than for the cases of surge and sway forces and the roll and yaw moments this is seen by the larger spread of the results obtained during test in waves head and following notice also that the pitch moment presents the larger spread of results obtained in waves indicating a larger influence due to waves the differences obtained for heave force and pitch moment between tests in cw and in waves however reduce as the ship speed increases 4 3 1 influence of the wave length bear in mind that the differences observed between the mean forces and moments obtained in cw and in waves see figs 14 19 have been pointed out for the dimensionless quantities it should be stressed that although in such representation wave effects were found to be insignificant especially at higher speeds their magnitudes might still be of relevance for manoeuvring hence to have a different perspective of the importance of wave effects their relative magnitudes mean values in waves subtracted from the mean values in cw are shown in fig 20 and fig 21 for two different speeds only in these figures in addition the cw magnitudes are also presented see right y axis on the figures different from the previous cases in figs 20 and 21 results are plotted as function of ship length to wave length ratio l pp λ this in order to have a better overall view of the influence of the main wave characteristics that have the largest influence on the ship behaviour in contrast to the cw results from figs 20 and 21 it can be observed that wave effects see left y axis on the figures in surge forces are the most significant with values up to 20 of the cw magnitude see right y axis at lower speeds however this is reduced to less than 10 when the ship speed increases for the case of sway and heave forces in general the influence of waves is also less than 10 of the cw values and this is even lower than 2 5 for heave forces at the higher speed see fig 21 with respect to the pitch moment only a relevant influence around 16 of the cw values is observed at longer wave lengths l p p λ 2 and at the lower speed but this is also reduced to less than 5 at the higher speed regarding the roll and yaw moments it can be stated that from all the quantities studied they are the least influenced by waves showing an insignificant change in their magnitudes in comparison with the ones obtained from tests in cw from figs 20 and 21 it can be stated that with respect to the drift angles and the wave length their influence on the wave effects for all forces and moments is in general small and can be considered negligible this in spite of the larger influence obtained for pitch moment at longer wave lengths recall that the present analysis is focused on coastal waves in such areas waves with shorter wave lengths are mostly predominant 4 3 2 added wave resistance prediction with hydrostar to further investigate the effect of waves the results for the added wave resistance r aw also represented by δ x obtained for tests conducted at zero drift angle and four different forward speeds have been presented in fig 22 in addition numerical results computed with the software hydrostar have also been displayed for comparison test results obtained for the larger wave amplitude are presented only for two different speeds in fig 23 from fig 22 it can be seen that the raw for the case of lower speed and the ships fully captive subscript fix present larger oscillations in its magnitudes in contrast to the results observed for the ship semi captive subscript free this can be attributed to the larger noise in frame b model fully fixed and smaller magnitudes obtained for the r aw the latter can be confirmed when looking to the results obtained in fig 23 where less fluctuation in the raw values is observed for the fully captive tests at larger wave amplitudes larger raw magnitudes are expected thus less significance of the noise in the results in spite of the differences obtained for raw at smaller wave amplitudes between the fully captive and semi captive tests it can be observed that both results see figs 22 and 23 slightly differ with respect to each other the latter indicates a less significant effect of the ship motions on the estimation of raw hence they could be neglected from the analysis this would simplify the problem for the estimation of raw however one should bear in mind that an approximation as such will not be satisfactory for the longer wave length range from figs 22 and 23 one can also observe that the computed values with hydrostar present larger discrepancies with the experiments at higher speeds the latter however cannot be addressed to the less accurate prediction of the ship motions because they have shown a good agreement in figs 10 13 but could be associated to the speed approximation used in hydrostar 4 4 superposition taking into consideration the observations made above further studies are conducted by comparing the time series obtained in waves with the ones obtained by the superposition of the wave forces and moments first and second order obtained from hydrostar to the calm water magnitudes the results are presented in fig 24 and fig 25 for one forward speed with and without the influence of the drift angle respectively in addition the calm water results are also displayed for a better insight from figs 24 and 25 it can be stated that in general for all force and moments the superposition approach offers a good approximation of the test results this holds true even for the case when a drift angle has been considered see fig 25 in spite of some minor discrepancies obtained for the particular case of roll moments the superposed values show an out of phase with respect to the test results for both figures the latter however can be addressed due to a slightly difference in the vertical position of the frame b s centre measured with respect to ship s waterline notice that compared to the results discussed earlier in this case larger incoming wave angles μ have been attained of around 202 5 deg for the tests with the drift angle observe also that the calm water cw forces and moments in red see figs 24 and 25 attain values which are similar to the mean of the respective quantities obtained in waves this means that the magnitudes of the mean second order wave effects have a small influence the latter however should not be considered as a reason to disregard the second order wave effects but instead as one to support the application of the superposition approach 4 5 propeller the results obtained from the experiments conducted with the propeller action in calm water and in head waves have been expressed in terms of thrust kt and torque kq coefficients and the torque wq and thrust wt wake fractions the respective results are shown in fig 26 from fig 26 with respect to the thrust and torque coefficients it is observed that the difference between the results obtained in calm water and in waves are rather small for all combinations of the apparent advance number j the variations expressed in terms of the wake fractions confirm these observations hence for the tests under consideration it can be stated that the influence of coastal waves on the propeller behaviour is rather negligible notice that wq presents negative values which are rather unrealistic but this is mainly due to the consideration of the open water characteristics adopted in the present study which corresponds to deep water although the open water characteristics corresponding to the 50 ukc is desired it should be stressed that for the present purpose which is to estimate the effect of waves on the propeller behaviour the differences between the calm water and the wave results are more relevant that the real wake fraction magnitudes hence the importance of the present analysis 4 6 thrust deduction factor the investigation of the thrust deduction factor t has also been conducted in the present study it is important to mention that the analysis does not necessarily correspond to the self propulsion point the values for the thrust deduction factor have been obtained from towing tanks tests with the model semi captive frame a the results for three different wave lengths are presented in fig 27 as a function of the apparent hydrodynamic angle ε it can be seen from fig 27 that the thrust deduction factor remains approximately constant as a function of ε this is observed for both results in calm water and in waves comparing both an insignificant change in their magnitudes with respect to each other can be noticed hence it can be stated that within the limits of shorter wave lengths the variation of the thrust deduction factors is indifferent to the wave action 4 7 rudder to investigate the effect of waves on the rudder performance the wake fraction deduced from the rudder x wrx and y wry force components have been obtained from tests in calm water and in head waves the results for both test types in calm water and in waves are presented for three different wave lengths in fig 28 it is important to mention that for the tests presented in fig 28 the parameters η k m and v r take the values of 0 71 0 95 and 0 respectively v r is zero because the currently discussed test results have only been obtained from test without drift angle β or yaw motion from fig 28 one can observe that the wake fraction wrx is larger than the ones obtained for wry both appear to change slightly with ε and always remain smaller than 1 except for wrx at the lowest ε with respect to wave effects on the wake fractions they do not seem significantly important hence the behaviour of the rudder can be considered as the same in waves as the ones obtained in calm water once more bear in mind that these observations are only restricted to the combinations of rudder angles shorter wave lengths and smaller wave amplitudes which are however representative of the operational conditions expected in coastal areas 5 conclusions an extensive experimental study has been conducted to investigate the manoeuvring behaviour of an ulcs in coastal waves the ship behaviour and environmental characteristics were chosen to represent the most common scenarios encountered when approaching or leaving a port for an ulcs this represents operating in the range of shorter waves lengths compared to the ship length from the analysis of the first order forces and moments no significant influence on the results was obtained when the hull drift angle was included these results were further compared to numerical estimations by hydrostar it has been found that such forces and moments can be estimated with a good approximation similar observations were made for the case of the wave induced ship motions from the comparison of the mean forces and moments obtained in calm water and in waves it has been found that the effect of waves are of great relevance up to 20 of the calm water values for surge forces at low speeds when the ship speed increases however the effect of waves become less significant with respect to the wave length the influence of ship motions and drift angles no significant dependence has been observed only a slight increase in the sway forces was noticed taking into consideration the first and second order wave forces and moments and the calm water contributions the superposition approach has also been investigated the results show that even when the drift angles are incorporated in the analysis such an approximation can be considered as appropriate to investigate manoeuvring in waves with respect to the propeller and rudder behaviour in waves the investigation revealed throughout the evaluation of the thrust and torque coefficients and the wake fractions that for the chosen wave characteristics and propeller rates and rudder angles wave effects seem negligible similar findings have been obtained for the thrust deduction factor acknowledgments the present work is performed in the frame of project wl 2013 47 scientific support for investigating the manoeuvring behaviour of ships in waves granted to ghent university by flanders hydraulics research antwerp department of mobility and public works flemish government belgium for the numerical calculations a hydrostar licence was put at the main author s disposal by bureau veritas through their antwerp and paris offices which is highly appreciated 
23051,the paper presents a numerical investigation of the ship collision response for a floating pontoon high fidelity finite element models of a container ship bow and a prestressed concrete pontoon wall are established the effect of prestressing on the collision resistance of the pontoon is discussed integrated numerical simulations are conducted to study the structural deformation and energy absorption of the striking ship and the struck pontoon the results are compared with the structural responses when a rigid ship collides with a deformable pontoon and a deformable ship collides against a rigid pontoon parametric studies are also carried out to investigate the effect of the pontoon wall thickness and the strength and dimension of the ship bulb a dynamic punching shear check procedure that can be used in the preliminary design phase is proposed 1 introduction the norwegian public roads administration npra is currently exploring the feasibility of constructing a new coastal highway along the west coast of norway eight fjord crossing installations will replace the existing ferry connections due to the wide and deep nature of the fjords installations with fixed foundations are almost impossible to construct due to both technical and financial restrictions alternatively novel floating bridges or tunnels have to be designed and constructed for the floating bridge concepts the bridge decks are typically supported by towers or columns resting on floating pontoons the large volume pontoons which float at the sea surface level are at risk of accidental ship collisions the potential collision loads may cause damage to the pontoon wall and lead to subsequent flooding in the pontoon compartments this can pose a significant threat to the safety of the floating bridge therefore the collision resistance of the pontoons should be carefully evaluated to prevent progressive collapse of the bridge due to the collision induced flooding in the pontoon many previous studies have been reported on ship collision analysis the earliest attempt for ship ship collision investigation was conducted by minorsky 1958 based on this work an empirical relationship between the volume of damaged material and the absorbed energy was proposed later woisin 1980 modified minorsky s method and proposed a new formula based on a number of high energy collision tests in the 1990s pedersen et al 1993 and amdahl and eberg 1993 investigated ship ship collisions and ship collision with offshore structures tabri et al 2009 proposed an analytical model for ship collision analysis based on full scale experiments more recently finite element fe methods have been widely used in analysing ship collision with other ships and offshore structures liu 2017 sun et al 2015 travanca and hao 2014 these works have offered good insights into the large displacement structural behaviour during a collision several widely used codes and guidelines such as aashto 1991 eurocode 1998 and norsok standard 2007 provide simplified formulae for estimating the collision loads however most of the previous studies focus on ship ship collision and ship collision with offshore structures the literature on ship collision with bridges is limited yuan and harik 2005 2008 2009 consolazio and davidson 2008 consolazio et al 2006 consolazio and cowan 2003 2005 cowan et al 2015 and sha and hao 2012 2013 2015 investigated barge collision with bridge piers the vessel models in these analyses are typically barges travelling in inland waterways the barges have much smaller bows compared with seagoing ships in addition ships normally have a larger displacement and travel faster kang et al 2017 this means ship induced collisions will easily exert a much larger demand for strain energy dissipation in the bridge structures for ship bridge collision fan and yuan 2014 numerically investigated the collision response of a bridge pile cap considering soil structure interaction later fan et al 2016 proposed an approach to determining the dynamic ship impact load based on the ship bow force deformation relationship the equations for estimating the load duration and the time history of ship deformation were analytically derived however the structural deformation of the bridge components was ignored in the analysis in numerical ship ship collision analyses it is commonly assumed that the relatively stronger striking ship bow is rigid while the struck ship side structure is deformable in ship bridge collision analyses the ship bow is typically modelled as a deformable structure and the reinforced concrete bridge pier is treated as a rigid body while such assumptions simplify the modelling and simulation efforts the idealization can sometimes lead to inaccurate results as the structural damage and energy dissipation of the bridge structure are neglected sha and hao 2012 it is necessary to conduct integrated analyses which account for the deformation of both the striking ship and the struck bridge for ship collision with floating bridges this integrated analysis is deemed to be more critical as the water tightness of the floating structure should be carefully checked sha and amdahl 2016 if a pontoon endures excessive damage the water tightness may not be maintained flooding of the pontoon may lead to collapse of the bridge superstructures in the paper finite element models of a container ship bow and a prestressed concrete pontoon wall are presented the prestress in the pontoon is included through a dynamic relaxation analysis the effect of prestress on the collision resistance of the pontoon is discussed integrated numerical simulations are conducted to study the structural deformation and energy absorption of the striking ship and the struck pontoon parametric studies are carried out to investigate the effect of the pontoon wall thickness the strength and dimension of the ship bulb a punching shear check procedure that can be used in the preliminary design phase is proposed 2 pontoon model a cable stayed continuous floating bridge concept is shown in fig 1 the cable stayed main span in the middle is supported by two towers resting on two main pontoons on each side of the main span the continuous deck girder sits on nine small pontoons at both sides of the bridge the waterway below the 450 m long cable stayed middle span is designed as the navigation channel for large container and cruise ships the two main pontoons are therefore especially exposed to ship collisions in addition they are more critical regarding the overall response of the whole bridge hence the focus is placed on the collision resistance of the main pontoons in this study 2 1 pontoon wall configuration the two main pontoons have the same dimension of 100 m in length and 40 m in width the height of each pontoon is 20 m including a freeboard of 4 m the pontoon dimensions are illustrated in fig 2 the pontoon is divided into 24 compartments so that the damage of one or two compartments will not lead to excessive flooding a finite element model based on this prototype is developed for the collision analysis in order to limit the modelling effort and to reduce the computational time only the front wall of the first middle compartment in the main pontoon was modelled in detail for the head on collision scenario as indicated by the dashed area in fig 2 moreover it was not necessary to model the whole pontoon as most of the structure is far away from the impact region and thus not expected to have any influence on the local collision response of the front wall the pontoon wall is constructed of prestressed reinforced concrete in order to accurately model the structural strength detailed modelling was applied to the concrete reinforcements and tendons in the pontoon as shown in fig 3 the 0 9 m thick concrete wall was modelled with 8 node solid elements two layers of reinforcement were embedded inside of the concrete cover of the pontoon wall the diameter of the rebar and the stirrup is 15 mm and 8 mm respectively the prestress in the concrete is provided by tendons made by strands of high strength steel wires the diameter of the vertical and transverse tendons is 90 mm and 70 mm respectively the tendons are placed between two layers of reinforcements the reinforcements and tendons were both modelled by circular beam elements 2 2 material modelling the material model mat 72r3 in ls dyna which can simulate concrete damage under impact and collision loads with good accuracy sha and hao 2012 2013 was used for the concrete material in the pontoon this material model has been widely employed to model the dynamic behaviour of concrete including plasticity and damage softening after failure the concrete has a compressive strength of 60 mpa and the failure strain is set to 0 1 sha and hao 2012 the elastic plastic material model mat piecewise linear plasticity was employed to model the steel reinforcements and tendons in the pontoon the reinforcements are made of normal mild steel with a yield stress of 275 mpa the tendons are typically designated cona cmi bt 1306 150 and made by high strength steel strands with a yield stress of 1860 mpa characteristic properties of all materials are tabulated in table 1 any strain rate effect was neglected in the study for both steel and concrete materials the main reason is that the strain rate effect is relatively small in the present case and is rather uncertain and challenging to analyze properly as discussed by storheim and amdahl 2017 it is normally conservative to neglect it for the struck pontoon but may be unconservative for the crushing force of the bow which represents the action it is also likely that the two effects may cancel each other to some extent 2 3 prestress modelling for floating pontoons it is critical to ensure the water tightness during their service life conventional pontoons are made of reinforced concrete rc due to the low tensile strength of concrete rc floating structures are vulnerable to tensile cracks which may develop under permanent hydrostatic loadings therefore significant efforts are required for the constant repairing of surface cracks to ensure the water tightness of the pontoons during their service life otherwise the surface cracks may eventually result in water leakage and pontoon flooding to save cost related to repair prestressed concrete pc may be used instead of reinforced concrete compared with rc structures the tensile strength of pc structures is greatly improved by the introduction of initial compressive stresses in this study the pre tensioning method is used to apply the initial stress to the pontoon wall in ls dyna three approaches may be used to tension the tendons and pre stress the concrete they include the static implicit method the transient explicit method and the dynamic relaxation method schwer 2016 in this work the dynamic relaxation technique is utilized an advantage of the dynamic relaxation method is that one can control the convergence of the analysis to make sure that the result is close to the desired quasi static state this can be achieved by plotting the convergence factor and energy curves after the dynamic relaxation analysis is finished to introduce prestress in the concrete the tendons are first tensioned to the desired axial force level nodal loads are applied at both ends of the tendons through a dynamic relaxation analysis the tensile stress in the tensioned tendons is stored and written into a dynain file for the concrete pre stressing in the second step the convergence of the dynamic relaxation analysis is checked by the convergence factor curve and total energy curve as shown in fig 4 the axial forces in the vertical and horizontal tendons after convergence are shown in fig 5 a the dynain file outputted from the tendon tensioning analysis is included in the input file for concrete pre stressing a dynamic relaxation analysis is conducted to transmit the tension stresses in the tendons to compressive stresses in the concrete to make sure the stress is correctly transmitted the tendon elements and concrete elements should be properly coupled there are different methods to ensure proper bonding between tendons and concrete including shear nodes using 1d element and defining constraints between tendons and concrete in this study the tendon beam elements and concrete solid elements are coupled by sharing nodes the compressive stresses in the concrete after convergence are shown in fig 5 b 3 ship bow model the ship bow model used in this study is based on the container ship shown in fig 6 with a displacement of 20 000 tons the ship has an overall length of 166 62 m and a moulded breadth of 27 4 m the depth and the scantling draught of the ship are 13 2 m and 9 6 m respectively as shown in fig 6 the first 20 m of the ship bow structures are modelled this is considered sufficient to avoid influence of boundary conditions for the crushing range analyzed the decks stringers and transverse frames are included in addition to the outer shell panels the vertical stiffeners have a spacing of 0 6 m the thickness of the steel components in the ship bow varies from 7 5 mm to 20 5 mm 3 1 element and mesh the four node belytschko lin tsay shell element with five integration points is used in modelling the ship bow structure because of its computational efficiency the mesh size not only has a critical influence on the accuracy and reliability of the results but is also related to the computational time the balance between simulation accuracy with respect to structural resistance fracture prediction and computational efficiency should be maintained in this study the element size is generally set to 80 mm which gives a length thickness ratio in the acceptable range of 4 10 kulzep and peschmann 1999 the mesh size for the pontoon is similar to that of the ship 3 2 material modelling material modelling is also a critical aspect in ship collision analysis a verified power law hardening model is used to model the steel material in the container ship alsos et al 2009 this material is assumed to have isotropic plastic properties and the yield condition is based on plane stress j2 flow theory the equivalent stress strain relationship is represented by a modified power law formulation which includes the plateau strain to delay the onset of hardening the plasticity formulation is assumed to be strain rate independent the rice tracey cockcroft latham criterion rtcl is used to model the material fracture it considers stress triaxiality to distinguish between shear and tension dominated damage fracture is initiated once the accumulated damage reaches a critical level the criterion is mesh scaled which has been proved to give a good simulation of steel fracture alsos et al 2009 the container ship is fabricated in mild steel with a yield stress of 275 mpa detailed material parameters are tabulated in table 2 3 3 pressure area relationship of ship bulb for the preliminary collision design of the pontoon an impact pressure contact area relationship can be utilized storheim and amdahl 2014 calculated the average pressure contact area relationship for a modern supply vessel of 7500 ton based on nonlinear fe simulations an empirical equation between the impact pressure and the contact area was proposed as 1 p 12 a 0 7 where p and a are the average impact pressure and the contact area respectively similarly the pressure area relationship is also obtained in the current study by crushing the ship bulb against a rigid wall local contact pressures over subsets of the total contact area were calculated at different stages of deformations of the bow the results are plotted in fig 7 a fitted curve is proposed and plotted together with the simulation results in the figure the fitted curves can be represented by 2 p 18 a 1 5 compared with the bulb of the supply vessel bow described by storheim and amdahl 2014 the container ship bulb is much stronger naturally a higher pressure is observed in the early stage when the contact area is small to account for this early stage high pressure a relatively large pressure coefficient of 18 and a small power coefficient of 1 5 is proposed as shown in eq 2 after the strong ship bulb head is crushed the contact pressure is dominated mainly by the crushing resistance of the stiffened hull and the horizontal decks the pressure area relationship at this stage is then in the similar range as the supply vessel it is worth mentioning that the local high pressures have very limited durations and are continuously changing position hence for the bulb collision with a concrete pontoon wall it is possible that the concrete wall will entirely resist or undergo small nonlinear deformations during the short lived contact forces further any partial failure of the concrete wall is likely to relax the contact force these aspects have so far not been addressed 4 numerical simulations to speed up the simulations the ship collides against the pontoon wall at a constant speed of 10 m s this is considered reasonable with respect to avoiding significant dynamic buckling effects while strain rate is not considered the actual damage is determined by the evaluation of the energy dissipation relationships the nodes at the four sides of the pontoon wall are fixed in all degrees of freedom this fixed boundary condition is considered appropriate as there are top and bottom slabs and transverse internal walls which support the wall portion we have modelled as shown in fig 2 since the impacted area is sufficiently far away from the boundary this fixed boundary condition will not influence the results significantly moreover the pontoon response is dominated by the local punching shear while the flexural response is marginal as discussed in section 4 the automatic surface to surface contact asts algorithm is used to model the interaction between the ship and the pontoon the internal contacts of the ship bow are considered by defining the automatic single surface contact assc algorithm for all ship parts the assc is also assigned to the concrete reinforcements and tendons for all contact types the static and dynamic friction coefficients are set to 0 3 sha and hao 2012 4 1 structural deformation and impact force apart from the integrated ship pontoon collision simulation a deformable ship against a deformable pontoon a deformable ship against a rigid pontoon and a rigid ship against a deformable pontoon are also simulated for comparison the force displacement curves for the three cases are plotted in fig 8 and the structural deformations are illustrated in fig 9 in the integrated analysis the collision force increases quickly to the first peak of 15 mn at 0 1 m displacement a small drop occurs at this time instant due to the crushing failure of the concrete cover the collision force then increases to 35 mn as more structural components in the ship bulb get in contact with the pontoon wall a significant decrease in impact force follows as the horizontal deck and first vertical frame in the bulb buckles after that clear crests and troughs can be observed due to the continuous buckling and crushing of decks and collapse of vertical frames in the ship bulb in general the ship bow endures a large deformation in the bulb the pontoon wall is generally intact during the whole collision process this shows that the strength of the pontoon wall is higher than that of the ship bulb the ship resistance determines the collision force history and the majority of the collision energy is dissipated through the deformation and damage of the ship bulb for deformable bow against a rigid pontoon the evolution of the impact force follows the same pattern as the integrated analysis but the variation between peaks and troughs is slightly larger in the first half of the deformation range thus the flexibility of the wall smoothens the curves somewhat but the average force remains the same the structural response is also similar to that in the integrated analysis as the strength of the ship bulb dominates the collision process the collision energy is only dissipated by deformation of the ship bulb in this case for rigid ship against a deformable pontoon wall the force displacement curve is completely different from the two other cases the pontoon strength controls the force level the peak force attains 35 mn and then quickly drops to a small value as the bulb penetrates the pontoon wall structural damage occurs only in the pontoon wall as shown in fig 9 c the collision energy is dissipated through the failure of the pontoon wall the ship bulb penetrates the pontoon wall in a very short time and the total energy dissipation is significantly lower than in the other two cases these results demonstrate the enormous importance that the resistance to the punching of the concrete wall plays for the present case it can be concluded that the pontoon behaves as if it had been dimensioned according to strength design principles norsok 2004 an assessment based on a rigid ship bow would be very conservative and may lead to design problems 4 2 effect of prestress to investigate the effect of prestressing a pontoon wall model without prestressing is developed the response to the deformable bulb impact is compared with that for the prestressed pontoon wall the impact force time histories are compared in fig 10 a up to 0 55 s the force curves are virtually identical as the bulb crushes and governs the collision force at 0 55 s corresponding to approximately 5 5 m crushing of the bulb and when the forces reach a peak of 50 mn the wall without prestressing is penetrated by the remaining part of the bulb this is associated with a dramatic drop in the force level the axial stress in the rebar is compared in fig 10 b for the prestressed wall the axial stress is relatively low throughout the collision process because the pontoon remains intact for the wall without prestressing the axial stress in the rebar increases rapidly from 0 5 s and then drops quickly to zero this is because the concrete cover suffers crushing damage that results in direct contact between the ship bulb and the reinforcements next the rebar breaks due to a tensile fracture fig 11 shows that the bulb dissipates the majority of the collision energy in both cases up to the level of 160 mj however the share of energy dissipation changes dramatically after 0 55 s when the pontoon without prestressing also starts to absorb energy this corresponds to impact speed of 4 m s for a 20 000 ton ship if all energy is dissipated as strain energy some energy may be transferred to kinetic energy of the pontoon and bridge thus for a larger impact speed the picture will change a lot in addition to the change of energy distribution flooding will take place in the non prestressed pontoon the effective plastic strain contours of the pontoon wall with and without prestressing are illustrated in fig 12 in the beginning the contours are quite similar in both cases and large plastic strains concentrate in the contact area with prestressing the pontoon maintains integrity during the whole collision process i e no hole that will lead to flooding is created in the wall without prestressing large strains develop in the lower part of the contact area at 0 4 s excessive damage occurs around the contact perimeter the concrete wall is partly crushed and will allow flooding to take place in both cases the ship forecastle starts to contact the top of the pontoon wall at 0 6 s 4 3 effect of pontoon wall thickness to evaluate the effect of the pontoon wall thickness on the collision resistance two analyses are conducted with thicknesses of 0 7 m and 0 8 m and compared with the original design of 0 9 m thickness in all cases the pontoon walls are prestressed the force displacement curves for the different wall thicknesses are shown in fig 13 when the wall thickness is 0 8 m or less the pontoon has insufficient capacity to resist the collision from the bulb for the deformation range analyzed a thinner wall fails earlier and results in a lower energy absorption ability prior to flooding the energy dissipated for 0 8 m thickness is about 60 mj while only 18 mj collision energy is dissipated for the 0 7 m thick wall the corresponding impact speed considering all energy to be dissipated as strain energy is 2 5 m s and 1 3 m s fig 14 shows the structural damage in the three cases the bulb penetrates the pontoon wall with very little deformation with a wall thickness of 0 7 m the crushing of the bulb before penetration is more pronounced for the 0 8 m thick wall while the pontoon with a wall thickness 0 9 m can resist the impact with very limited spalling damages on the surface this shows that the structural damage is very sensitive to the relative strength of the ship bulb and the pontoon wall the major deformation switches from the ship to the pontoon when the wall thickness is reduced from 0 9 m to 0 8 m or less 4 4 punching shear considerations when the pontoon strength is smaller than the ship bulb a typical punching shear failure takes place in the pontoon wall see fig 14 a and b according to eurocode 2 2004 the punching shear stress for a reinforced concrete slab can be calculated based on the impact loads and slab dimensions the shear stress should be checked at the loading and the control perimeters as shown in fig 15 the shear stress at the loading perimeter should not exceed the shear capacity of the structure as given in the following equation 3 v e d β v e d u 0 d v r d m a x 0 4 0 6 1 f c k 250 f c d where ν e d is the numerically calculated shear stress ν r d max is the shear capacity at the loading perimeter β 1 15 is the factor accounting for eccentricity and v e d is the shear force u 0 is the perimeter of the loaded area and d is the effective depth of the wall f c d 60 m p a and f c k 50 m p a are the design and cylinder compressive strength of the concrete similarly the shear stress at the basic control perimeter should be checked by 4 v e d β v e d u 1 d v r d c c r d c k 100 ρ 1 f c k 1 3 where ν r d c is the shear capacity at the basic perimeters and u 1 is the perimeter of the basic control area c r d c 0 12 and k 1 0 2 d 2 are the size coefficients ρ 1 0 02 is the reinforcement ratio the punching shear check method is applied herein for ship collision with the prestressed pontoon wall the shear force in eqs 3 and 4 are taken as the impact load obtained from the numerical simulation as the impact force is time dependent the numerically calculated shear stresses also vary with time hence a dynamic punching shear check with respect to time is plotted for different wall thickness as shown in fig 16 the shear stresses at the loading and the control perimeters calculated based on the simulation results are then compared with the code specified shear capacities the shear stress history and the shear capacity for a 0 9 m thick pontoon wall are shown in fig 16 a the shear stress at the loading perimeter is much lower than the capacity most of the time except for the beginning when the calculated shear stress exceeds the capacity at this stage the contact area is small and the loading is short lived so it does not lead to punching failure of the pontoon wall at the control perimeter the calculated shear stress is fluctuating around the shear capacity for the 0 8 m thick pontoon wall the shear stress at the loading perimeter is also much lower than the capacity at the control perimeter the shear stress becomes consistently larger than the capacity after 0 22 s see fig 16 b and the pontoon wall fails this predicted failure time agrees well with the impact force time history as shown in fig 13 fig 16 c shows that the 0 7 m thick pontoon wall still has sufficient shear capacity at the loading perimeter the shear stress at the control perimeter is however larger than the shear capacity after around 0 07 s this also agrees well with the impact force time history in fig 13 generally the shear capacity at the loading perimeter is sufficient for the current ship collision load however the shear stress is close to or exceeds the capacity at the control perimeter these results illustrate that punching shear check approach can be efficiently used in the preliminary design phase 4 5 effect of ship bulb type the above analysis is conducted with a ship bow model for a 20 000 ton container ship to cover a wider range of ship bows two additional bow models were developed one is a cruise ship of a similar displacement but it has a lower bulb height of 5 5 m as shown in fig 17 b the ship was constructed of normal strength steel with a yield stress of 275 mpa and the plate thickness is in the range of 9 14 5 mm fig 17 c shows the bow model of an ice strengthened container ship which was constructed of high strength steel with a yield stress of 390 mpa and the steel plate thickness is typically in the range of 16 25 mm the ship models are illustrated in fig 17 and the corresponding dimensions of the three bulbs are listed in table 3 crushing simulation against a rigid wall is first conducted and the force crush depth relationships are compared for the three ship bows as shown in fig 18 the cruise ship and the normal container ship have a maximum force level of 25 mn and 50 mn respectively for the ice strengthened container ship the force level is much higher and reaches 80 mn thus the three bow models cover a wide range of ship bow strength and it is interesting to compare the response of the pontoon to these bow collisions it should be noted that the force crush depth curves are only presented up to 5 m crush depth upon further crash the force level may vary depending on the structural configuration in the ship bow integrated analyses are carried out for the pontoon wall with a thickness of 0 9 m the ship bows have an initial velocity of 10 m s in all three cases ship and pontoon wall damages are compared in fig 19 and fig 20 it comes as no surprise that the bulb of the cruise ship deforms completely as it is weaker than the container vessel the pontoon wall remains generally intact in the ice strengthened vessel case the bulb suffers very limited deformation while a large punching hole is created in the pontoon wall upon contact very limited less than 2 mj energy is dissipated when the pontoon wall is punched through further investigation would be needed for the damage stability with flooded compartments and the global response of the whole bridge the proposed 0 9 m thick pontoon wall with prestressing represents a strength design concept with respect to collisions from normal strength ship bows with a displacement in the range of 20 000 to 40 000 tons however this is no longer the case if ice strengthened ships pass the bridge the major damage will typically switch from the ship bulb to the pontoon moreover if penetration of one compartment is not sufficient to dissipate all the collision energy several compartments must be involved this could in turn lead to pontoon sinking or overturning that could put the global bridge stability in jeopardy 5 conclusions finite element models of a prestressed pontoon wall for a floating bridge and the bow of a 20 000 ton container ship were established and numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the response of the ship and pontoon during a collision the findings from the current study can be summarized as follows the introduction of a prestress in the pontoon wall will not only help to ensure the water tightness of the structure but also increases the collision resistance a 0 9 m thick pontoon remained generally intact under the collision of the container ship bow in the case studied it would be very conservative to assume the ship bow to be rigid because the energy dissipation was mostly taking place in the ship bow the results from the simulations were compared with the punching shear checks formulated in eurocode 2 it was found the shear capacity at the loading perimeter was normally sufficient the shear stress at the control perimeter tends to be more critical the requirements largely confirmed the results from the numerical simulations and showed that the procedure may be efficiently used in the preliminary design based on the force deformation and contact area deformation curves for the design collision event the structural damage was very sensitive to the relative strength of the ship bulb and the pontoon wall the major deformation switched from the ship to the pontoon when the pontoon wall thickness was reduced from 0 9 m to 0 8 m or less the simulations showed that the pontoon could be considered dimensioned according to strength design principles as far as the collisions with normal strength ship are concerned however the major structural failure can easily switch from the ship to the pontoon if an ice strengthened ship is involved the transition between different design regimes is very sensitive to the relative strength and it is important to critically evaluate the collision scenario and adopt accurate analysis methods in the bridge design process notably if strength design shall apply acknowledgement this work was supported by the norwegian public roads

23051,the paper presents a numerical investigation of the ship collision response for a floating pontoon high fidelity finite element models of a container ship bow and a prestressed concrete pontoon wall are established the effect of prestressing on the collision resistance of the pontoon is discussed integrated numerical simulations are conducted to study the structural deformation and energy absorption of the striking ship and the struck pontoon the results are compared with the structural responses when a rigid ship collides with a deformable pontoon and a deformable ship collides against a rigid pontoon parametric studies are also carried out to investigate the effect of the pontoon wall thickness and the strength and dimension of the ship bulb a dynamic punching shear check procedure that can be used in the preliminary design phase is proposed 1 introduction the norwegian public roads administration npra is currently exploring the feasibility of constructing a new coastal highway along the west coast of norway eight fjord crossing installations will replace the existing ferry connections due to the wide and deep nature of the fjords installations with fixed foundations are almost impossible to construct due to both technical and financial restrictions alternatively novel floating bridges or tunnels have to be designed and constructed for the floating bridge concepts the bridge decks are typically supported by towers or columns resting on floating pontoons the large volume pontoons which float at the sea surface level are at risk of accidental ship collisions the potential collision loads may cause damage to the pontoon wall and lead to subsequent flooding in the pontoon compartments this can pose a significant threat to the safety of the floating bridge therefore the collision resistance of the pontoons should be carefully evaluated to prevent progressive collapse of the bridge due to the collision induced flooding in the pontoon many previous studies have been reported on ship collision analysis the earliest attempt for ship ship collision investigation was conducted by minorsky 1958 based on this work an empirical relationship between the volume of damaged material and the absorbed energy was proposed later woisin 1980 modified minorsky s method and proposed a new formula based on a number of high energy collision tests in the 1990s pedersen et al 1993 and amdahl and eberg 1993 investigated ship ship collisions and ship collision with offshore structures tabri et al 2009 proposed an analytical model for ship collision analysis based on full scale experiments more recently finite element fe methods have been widely used in analysing ship collision with other ships and offshore structures liu 2017 sun et al 2015 travanca and hao 2014 these works have offered good insights into the large displacement structural behaviour during a collision several widely used codes and guidelines such as aashto 1991 eurocode 1998 and norsok standard 2007 provide simplified formulae for estimating the collision loads however most of the previous studies focus on ship ship collision and ship collision with offshore structures the literature on ship collision with bridges is limited yuan and harik 2005 2008 2009 consolazio and davidson 2008 consolazio et al 2006 consolazio and cowan 2003 2005 cowan et al 2015 and sha and hao 2012 2013 2015 investigated barge collision with bridge piers the vessel models in these analyses are typically barges travelling in inland waterways the barges have much smaller bows compared with seagoing ships in addition ships normally have a larger displacement and travel faster kang et al 2017 this means ship induced collisions will easily exert a much larger demand for strain energy dissipation in the bridge structures for ship bridge collision fan and yuan 2014 numerically investigated the collision response of a bridge pile cap considering soil structure interaction later fan et al 2016 proposed an approach to determining the dynamic ship impact load based on the ship bow force deformation relationship the equations for estimating the load duration and the time history of ship deformation were analytically derived however the structural deformation of the bridge components was ignored in the analysis in numerical ship ship collision analyses it is commonly assumed that the relatively stronger striking ship bow is rigid while the struck ship side structure is deformable in ship bridge collision analyses the ship bow is typically modelled as a deformable structure and the reinforced concrete bridge pier is treated as a rigid body while such assumptions simplify the modelling and simulation efforts the idealization can sometimes lead to inaccurate results as the structural damage and energy dissipation of the bridge structure are neglected sha and hao 2012 it is necessary to conduct integrated analyses which account for the deformation of both the striking ship and the struck bridge for ship collision with floating bridges this integrated analysis is deemed to be more critical as the water tightness of the floating structure should be carefully checked sha and amdahl 2016 if a pontoon endures excessive damage the water tightness may not be maintained flooding of the pontoon may lead to collapse of the bridge superstructures in the paper finite element models of a container ship bow and a prestressed concrete pontoon wall are presented the prestress in the pontoon is included through a dynamic relaxation analysis the effect of prestress on the collision resistance of the pontoon is discussed integrated numerical simulations are conducted to study the structural deformation and energy absorption of the striking ship and the struck pontoon parametric studies are carried out to investigate the effect of the pontoon wall thickness the strength and dimension of the ship bulb a punching shear check procedure that can be used in the preliminary design phase is proposed 2 pontoon model a cable stayed continuous floating bridge concept is shown in fig 1 the cable stayed main span in the middle is supported by two towers resting on two main pontoons on each side of the main span the continuous deck girder sits on nine small pontoons at both sides of the bridge the waterway below the 450 m long cable stayed middle span is designed as the navigation channel for large container and cruise ships the two main pontoons are therefore especially exposed to ship collisions in addition they are more critical regarding the overall response of the whole bridge hence the focus is placed on the collision resistance of the main pontoons in this study 2 1 pontoon wall configuration the two main pontoons have the same dimension of 100 m in length and 40 m in width the height of each pontoon is 20 m including a freeboard of 4 m the pontoon dimensions are illustrated in fig 2 the pontoon is divided into 24 compartments so that the damage of one or two compartments will not lead to excessive flooding a finite element model based on this prototype is developed for the collision analysis in order to limit the modelling effort and to reduce the computational time only the front wall of the first middle compartment in the main pontoon was modelled in detail for the head on collision scenario as indicated by the dashed area in fig 2 moreover it was not necessary to model the whole pontoon as most of the structure is far away from the impact region and thus not expected to have any influence on the local collision response of the front wall the pontoon wall is constructed of prestressed reinforced concrete in order to accurately model the structural strength detailed modelling was applied to the concrete reinforcements and tendons in the pontoon as shown in fig 3 the 0 9 m thick concrete wall was modelled with 8 node solid elements two layers of reinforcement were embedded inside of the concrete cover of the pontoon wall the diameter of the rebar and the stirrup is 15 mm and 8 mm respectively the prestress in the concrete is provided by tendons made by strands of high strength steel wires the diameter of the vertical and transverse tendons is 90 mm and 70 mm respectively the tendons are placed between two layers of reinforcements the reinforcements and tendons were both modelled by circular beam elements 2 2 material modelling the material model mat 72r3 in ls dyna which can simulate concrete damage under impact and collision loads with good accuracy sha and hao 2012 2013 was used for the concrete material in the pontoon this material model has been widely employed to model the dynamic behaviour of concrete including plasticity and damage softening after failure the concrete has a compressive strength of 60 mpa and the failure strain is set to 0 1 sha and hao 2012 the elastic plastic material model mat piecewise linear plasticity was employed to model the steel reinforcements and tendons in the pontoon the reinforcements are made of normal mild steel with a yield stress of 275 mpa the tendons are typically designated cona cmi bt 1306 150 and made by high strength steel strands with a yield stress of 1860 mpa characteristic properties of all materials are tabulated in table 1 any strain rate effect was neglected in the study for both steel and concrete materials the main reason is that the strain rate effect is relatively small in the present case and is rather uncertain and challenging to analyze properly as discussed by storheim and amdahl 2017 it is normally conservative to neglect it for the struck pontoon but may be unconservative for the crushing force of the bow which represents the action it is also likely that the two effects may cancel each other to some extent 2 3 prestress modelling for floating pontoons it is critical to ensure the water tightness during their service life conventional pontoons are made of reinforced concrete rc due to the low tensile strength of concrete rc floating structures are vulnerable to tensile cracks which may develop under permanent hydrostatic loadings therefore significant efforts are required for the constant repairing of surface cracks to ensure the water tightness of the pontoons during their service life otherwise the surface cracks may eventually result in water leakage and pontoon flooding to save cost related to repair prestressed concrete pc may be used instead of reinforced concrete compared with rc structures the tensile strength of pc structures is greatly improved by the introduction of initial compressive stresses in this study the pre tensioning method is used to apply the initial stress to the pontoon wall in ls dyna three approaches may be used to tension the tendons and pre stress the concrete they include the static implicit method the transient explicit method and the dynamic relaxation method schwer 2016 in this work the dynamic relaxation technique is utilized an advantage of the dynamic relaxation method is that one can control the convergence of the analysis to make sure that the result is close to the desired quasi static state this can be achieved by plotting the convergence factor and energy curves after the dynamic relaxation analysis is finished to introduce prestress in the concrete the tendons are first tensioned to the desired axial force level nodal loads are applied at both ends of the tendons through a dynamic relaxation analysis the tensile stress in the tensioned tendons is stored and written into a dynain file for the concrete pre stressing in the second step the convergence of the dynamic relaxation analysis is checked by the convergence factor curve and total energy curve as shown in fig 4 the axial forces in the vertical and horizontal tendons after convergence are shown in fig 5 a the dynain file outputted from the tendon tensioning analysis is included in the input file for concrete pre stressing a dynamic relaxation analysis is conducted to transmit the tension stresses in the tendons to compressive stresses in the concrete to make sure the stress is correctly transmitted the tendon elements and concrete elements should be properly coupled there are different methods to ensure proper bonding between tendons and concrete including shear nodes using 1d element and defining constraints between tendons and concrete in this study the tendon beam elements and concrete solid elements are coupled by sharing nodes the compressive stresses in the concrete after convergence are shown in fig 5 b 3 ship bow model the ship bow model used in this study is based on the container ship shown in fig 6 with a displacement of 20 000 tons the ship has an overall length of 166 62 m and a moulded breadth of 27 4 m the depth and the scantling draught of the ship are 13 2 m and 9 6 m respectively as shown in fig 6 the first 20 m of the ship bow structures are modelled this is considered sufficient to avoid influence of boundary conditions for the crushing range analyzed the decks stringers and transverse frames are included in addition to the outer shell panels the vertical stiffeners have a spacing of 0 6 m the thickness of the steel components in the ship bow varies from 7 5 mm to 20 5 mm 3 1 element and mesh the four node belytschko lin tsay shell element with five integration points is used in modelling the ship bow structure because of its computational efficiency the mesh size not only has a critical influence on the accuracy and reliability of the results but is also related to the computational time the balance between simulation accuracy with respect to structural resistance fracture prediction and computational efficiency should be maintained in this study the element size is generally set to 80 mm which gives a length thickness ratio in the acceptable range of 4 10 kulzep and peschmann 1999 the mesh size for the pontoon is similar to that of the ship 3 2 material modelling material modelling is also a critical aspect in ship collision analysis a verified power law hardening model is used to model the steel material in the container ship alsos et al 2009 this material is assumed to have isotropic plastic properties and the yield condition is based on plane stress j2 flow theory the equivalent stress strain relationship is represented by a modified power law formulation which includes the plateau strain to delay the onset of hardening the plasticity formulation is assumed to be strain rate independent the rice tracey cockcroft latham criterion rtcl is used to model the material fracture it considers stress triaxiality to distinguish between shear and tension dominated damage fracture is initiated once the accumulated damage reaches a critical level the criterion is mesh scaled which has been proved to give a good simulation of steel fracture alsos et al 2009 the container ship is fabricated in mild steel with a yield stress of 275 mpa detailed material parameters are tabulated in table 2 3 3 pressure area relationship of ship bulb for the preliminary collision design of the pontoon an impact pressure contact area relationship can be utilized storheim and amdahl 2014 calculated the average pressure contact area relationship for a modern supply vessel of 7500 ton based on nonlinear fe simulations an empirical equation between the impact pressure and the contact area was proposed as 1 p 12 a 0 7 where p and a are the average impact pressure and the contact area respectively similarly the pressure area relationship is also obtained in the current study by crushing the ship bulb against a rigid wall local contact pressures over subsets of the total contact area were calculated at different stages of deformations of the bow the results are plotted in fig 7 a fitted curve is proposed and plotted together with the simulation results in the figure the fitted curves can be represented by 2 p 18 a 1 5 compared with the bulb of the supply vessel bow described by storheim and amdahl 2014 the container ship bulb is much stronger naturally a higher pressure is observed in the early stage when the contact area is small to account for this early stage high pressure a relatively large pressure coefficient of 18 and a small power coefficient of 1 5 is proposed as shown in eq 2 after the strong ship bulb head is crushed the contact pressure is dominated mainly by the crushing resistance of the stiffened hull and the horizontal decks the pressure area relationship at this stage is then in the similar range as the supply vessel it is worth mentioning that the local high pressures have very limited durations and are continuously changing position hence for the bulb collision with a concrete pontoon wall it is possible that the concrete wall will entirely resist or undergo small nonlinear deformations during the short lived contact forces further any partial failure of the concrete wall is likely to relax the contact force these aspects have so far not been addressed 4 numerical simulations to speed up the simulations the ship collides against the pontoon wall at a constant speed of 10 m s this is considered reasonable with respect to avoiding significant dynamic buckling effects while strain rate is not considered the actual damage is determined by the evaluation of the energy dissipation relationships the nodes at the four sides of the pontoon wall are fixed in all degrees of freedom this fixed boundary condition is considered appropriate as there are top and bottom slabs and transverse internal walls which support the wall portion we have modelled as shown in fig 2 since the impacted area is sufficiently far away from the boundary this fixed boundary condition will not influence the results significantly moreover the pontoon response is dominated by the local punching shear while the flexural response is marginal as discussed in section 4 the automatic surface to surface contact asts algorithm is used to model the interaction between the ship and the pontoon the internal contacts of the ship bow are considered by defining the automatic single surface contact assc algorithm for all ship parts the assc is also assigned to the concrete reinforcements and tendons for all contact types the static and dynamic friction coefficients are set to 0 3 sha and hao 2012 4 1 structural deformation and impact force apart from the integrated ship pontoon collision simulation a deformable ship against a deformable pontoon a deformable ship against a rigid pontoon and a rigid ship against a deformable pontoon are also simulated for comparison the force displacement curves for the three cases are plotted in fig 8 and the structural deformations are illustrated in fig 9 in the integrated analysis the collision force increases quickly to the first peak of 15 mn at 0 1 m displacement a small drop occurs at this time instant due to the crushing failure of the concrete cover the collision force then increases to 35 mn as more structural components in the ship bulb get in contact with the pontoon wall a significant decrease in impact force follows as the horizontal deck and first vertical frame in the bulb buckles after that clear crests and troughs can be observed due to the continuous buckling and crushing of decks and collapse of vertical frames in the ship bulb in general the ship bow endures a large deformation in the bulb the pontoon wall is generally intact during the whole collision process this shows that the strength of the pontoon wall is higher than that of the ship bulb the ship resistance determines the collision force history and the majority of the collision energy is dissipated through the deformation and damage of the ship bulb for deformable bow against a rigid pontoon the evolution of the impact force follows the same pattern as the integrated analysis but the variation between peaks and troughs is slightly larger in the first half of the deformation range thus the flexibility of the wall smoothens the curves somewhat but the average force remains the same the structural response is also similar to that in the integrated analysis as the strength of the ship bulb dominates the collision process the collision energy is only dissipated by deformation of the ship bulb in this case for rigid ship against a deformable pontoon wall the force displacement curve is completely different from the two other cases the pontoon strength controls the force level the peak force attains 35 mn and then quickly drops to a small value as the bulb penetrates the pontoon wall structural damage occurs only in the pontoon wall as shown in fig 9 c the collision energy is dissipated through the failure of the pontoon wall the ship bulb penetrates the pontoon wall in a very short time and the total energy dissipation is significantly lower than in the other two cases these results demonstrate the enormous importance that the resistance to the punching of the concrete wall plays for the present case it can be concluded that the pontoon behaves as if it had been dimensioned according to strength design principles norsok 2004 an assessment based on a rigid ship bow would be very conservative and may lead to design problems 4 2 effect of prestress to investigate the effect of prestressing a pontoon wall model without prestressing is developed the response to the deformable bulb impact is compared with that for the prestressed pontoon wall the impact force time histories are compared in fig 10 a up to 0 55 s the force curves are virtually identical as the bulb crushes and governs the collision force at 0 55 s corresponding to approximately 5 5 m crushing of the bulb and when the forces reach a peak of 50 mn the wall without prestressing is penetrated by the remaining part of the bulb this is associated with a dramatic drop in the force level the axial stress in the rebar is compared in fig 10 b for the prestressed wall the axial stress is relatively low throughout the collision process because the pontoon remains intact for the wall without prestressing the axial stress in the rebar increases rapidly from 0 5 s and then drops quickly to zero this is because the concrete cover suffers crushing damage that results in direct contact between the ship bulb and the reinforcements next the rebar breaks due to a tensile fracture fig 11 shows that the bulb dissipates the majority of the collision energy in both cases up to the level of 160 mj however the share of energy dissipation changes dramatically after 0 55 s when the pontoon without prestressing also starts to absorb energy this corresponds to impact speed of 4 m s for a 20 000 ton ship if all energy is dissipated as strain energy some energy may be transferred to kinetic energy of the pontoon and bridge thus for a larger impact speed the picture will change a lot in addition to the change of energy distribution flooding will take place in the non prestressed pontoon the effective plastic strain contours of the pontoon wall with and without prestressing are illustrated in fig 12 in the beginning the contours are quite similar in both cases and large plastic strains concentrate in the contact area with prestressing the pontoon maintains integrity during the whole collision process i e no hole that will lead to flooding is created in the wall without prestressing large strains develop in the lower part of the contact area at 0 4 s excessive damage occurs around the contact perimeter the concrete wall is partly crushed and will allow flooding to take place in both cases the ship forecastle starts to contact the top of the pontoon wall at 0 6 s 4 3 effect of pontoon wall thickness to evaluate the effect of the pontoon wall thickness on the collision resistance two analyses are conducted with thicknesses of 0 7 m and 0 8 m and compared with the original design of 0 9 m thickness in all cases the pontoon walls are prestressed the force displacement curves for the different wall thicknesses are shown in fig 13 when the wall thickness is 0 8 m or less the pontoon has insufficient capacity to resist the collision from the bulb for the deformation range analyzed a thinner wall fails earlier and results in a lower energy absorption ability prior to flooding the energy dissipated for 0 8 m thickness is about 60 mj while only 18 mj collision energy is dissipated for the 0 7 m thick wall the corresponding impact speed considering all energy to be dissipated as strain energy is 2 5 m s and 1 3 m s fig 14 shows the structural damage in the three cases the bulb penetrates the pontoon wall with very little deformation with a wall thickness of 0 7 m the crushing of the bulb before penetration is more pronounced for the 0 8 m thick wall while the pontoon with a wall thickness 0 9 m can resist the impact with very limited spalling damages on the surface this shows that the structural damage is very sensitive to the relative strength of the ship bulb and the pontoon wall the major deformation switches from the ship to the pontoon when the wall thickness is reduced from 0 9 m to 0 8 m or less 4 4 punching shear considerations when the pontoon strength is smaller than the ship bulb a typical punching shear failure takes place in the pontoon wall see fig 14 a and b according to eurocode 2 2004 the punching shear stress for a reinforced concrete slab can be calculated based on the impact loads and slab dimensions the shear stress should be checked at the loading and the control perimeters as shown in fig 15 the shear stress at the loading perimeter should not exceed the shear capacity of the structure as given in the following equation 3 v e d β v e d u 0 d v r d m a x 0 4 0 6 1 f c k 250 f c d where ν e d is the numerically calculated shear stress ν r d max is the shear capacity at the loading perimeter β 1 15 is the factor accounting for eccentricity and v e d is the shear force u 0 is the perimeter of the loaded area and d is the effective depth of the wall f c d 60 m p a and f c k 50 m p a are the design and cylinder compressive strength of the concrete similarly the shear stress at the basic control perimeter should be checked by 4 v e d β v e d u 1 d v r d c c r d c k 100 ρ 1 f c k 1 3 where ν r d c is the shear capacity at the basic perimeters and u 1 is the perimeter of the basic control area c r d c 0 12 and k 1 0 2 d 2 are the size coefficients ρ 1 0 02 is the reinforcement ratio the punching shear check method is applied herein for ship collision with the prestressed pontoon wall the shear force in eqs 3 and 4 are taken as the impact load obtained from the numerical simulation as the impact force is time dependent the numerically calculated shear stresses also vary with time hence a dynamic punching shear check with respect to time is plotted for different wall thickness as shown in fig 16 the shear stresses at the loading and the control perimeters calculated based on the simulation results are then compared with the code specified shear capacities the shear stress history and the shear capacity for a 0 9 m thick pontoon wall are shown in fig 16 a the shear stress at the loading perimeter is much lower than the capacity most of the time except for the beginning when the calculated shear stress exceeds the capacity at this stage the contact area is small and the loading is short lived so it does not lead to punching failure of the pontoon wall at the control perimeter the calculated shear stress is fluctuating around the shear capacity for the 0 8 m thick pontoon wall the shear stress at the loading perimeter is also much lower than the capacity at the control perimeter the shear stress becomes consistently larger than the capacity after 0 22 s see fig 16 b and the pontoon wall fails this predicted failure time agrees well with the impact force time history as shown in fig 13 fig 16 c shows that the 0 7 m thick pontoon wall still has sufficient shear capacity at the loading perimeter the shear stress at the control perimeter is however larger than the shear capacity after around 0 07 s this also agrees well with the impact force time history in fig 13 generally the shear capacity at the loading perimeter is sufficient for the current ship collision load however the shear stress is close to or exceeds the capacity at the control perimeter these results illustrate that punching shear check approach can be efficiently used in the preliminary design phase 4 5 effect of ship bulb type the above analysis is conducted with a ship bow model for a 20 000 ton container ship to cover a wider range of ship bows two additional bow models were developed one is a cruise ship of a similar displacement but it has a lower bulb height of 5 5 m as shown in fig 17 b the ship was constructed of normal strength steel with a yield stress of 275 mpa and the plate thickness is in the range of 9 14 5 mm fig 17 c shows the bow model of an ice strengthened container ship which was constructed of high strength steel with a yield stress of 390 mpa and the steel plate thickness is typically in the range of 16 25 mm the ship models are illustrated in fig 17 and the corresponding dimensions of the three bulbs are listed in table 3 crushing simulation against a rigid wall is first conducted and the force crush depth relationships are compared for the three ship bows as shown in fig 18 the cruise ship and the normal container ship have a maximum force level of 25 mn and 50 mn respectively for the ice strengthened container ship the force level is much higher and reaches 80 mn thus the three bow models cover a wide range of ship bow strength and it is interesting to compare the response of the pontoon to these bow collisions it should be noted that the force crush depth curves are only presented up to 5 m crush depth upon further crash the force level may vary depending on the structural configuration in the ship bow integrated analyses are carried out for the pontoon wall with a thickness of 0 9 m the ship bows have an initial velocity of 10 m s in all three cases ship and pontoon wall damages are compared in fig 19 and fig 20 it comes as no surprise that the bulb of the cruise ship deforms completely as it is weaker than the container vessel the pontoon wall remains generally intact in the ice strengthened vessel case the bulb suffers very limited deformation while a large punching hole is created in the pontoon wall upon contact very limited less than 2 mj energy is dissipated when the pontoon wall is punched through further investigation would be needed for the damage stability with flooded compartments and the global response of the whole bridge the proposed 0 9 m thick pontoon wall with prestressing represents a strength design concept with respect to collisions from normal strength ship bows with a displacement in the range of 20 000 to 40 000 tons however this is no longer the case if ice strengthened ships pass the bridge the major damage will typically switch from the ship bulb to the pontoon moreover if penetration of one compartment is not sufficient to dissipate all the collision energy several compartments must be involved this could in turn lead to pontoon sinking or overturning that could put the global bridge stability in jeopardy 5 conclusions finite element models of a prestressed pontoon wall for a floating bridge and the bow of a 20 000 ton container ship were established and numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the response of the ship and pontoon during a collision the findings from the current study can be summarized as follows the introduction of a prestress in the pontoon wall will not only help to ensure the water tightness of the structure but also increases the collision resistance a 0 9 m thick pontoon remained generally intact under the collision of the container ship bow in the case studied it would be very conservative to assume the ship bow to be rigid because the energy dissipation was mostly taking place in the ship bow the results from the simulations were compared with the punching shear checks formulated in eurocode 2 it was found the shear capacity at the loading perimeter was normally sufficient the shear stress at the control perimeter tends to be more critical the requirements largely confirmed the results from the numerical simulations and showed that the procedure may be efficiently used in the preliminary design based on the force deformation and contact area deformation curves for the design collision event the structural damage was very sensitive to the relative strength of the ship bulb and the pontoon wall the major deformation switched from the ship to the pontoon when the pontoon wall thickness was reduced from 0 9 m to 0 8 m or less the simulations showed that the pontoon could be considered dimensioned according to strength design principles as far as the collisions with normal strength ship are concerned however the major structural failure can easily switch from the ship to the pontoon if an ice strengthened ship is involved the transition between different design regimes is very sensitive to the relative strength and it is important to critically evaluate the collision scenario and adopt accurate analysis methods in the bridge design process notably if strength design shall apply acknowledgement this work was supported by the norwegian public roads

density ratio 1 introduction freely moving particles in pipe flows are commonly observed in industrial flows examples are ores in lifting pipes in deep sea mining and pulverized coal in conveying pipelines the particle migration in tube flows is a classic issue in fluid mechanics particularly in two phase flow in the 1960s segré and silberberg 1961 discovered that the dilute suspended neutrally buoyant spheres in tube flows migrate away from both the wall and the centerline and accumulate at a radial position of approximately 0 6 times the tube radius namely the segré silberberg effect numerous experimental and theoretical works have been conducted to verify and explain the particle migration in a tube jeffrey and pearson 1965 karnis et al 1966 schonberg and hinch 1989 asmolv 1999 comprehensive reviews of theoretical and experimental studies have been presented by brenner 1966 cox and mason 1971 and leal 1980 in early years as one of the simplest shear flows in tubes the poiseuille flow with velocity profile defined as u u m 1 r r 2 u m is the maximum flow velocity in the tube center r is the radial position and r is the radius of the tube has been widely considered in previous studies when investigating particle migration in tubes generally the spherical particles have been selected the tube reynolds number r e t u m r ν ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid is one of the key factors affecting the particle motion and flow pattern in the tube analytical expressions have already been provided by numerous researchers since the 1960s bretherton 1962 saffman 1965 asmolv 1999 however the results were mostly based on perturbing stokes flow or potential flow which limited the applications of the expressions feng et al 1994 investigated the migration of a two dimensional circular particle in poiseuille flow at r e t o 10 r e t m a x 120 by numerical simulations focusing on the axial and radial migration of the sphere and the lift force four types of contributions to the lift force were distinguished a wall repulsion owing to lubrication an inertial lift related to shear slip a lift owing to particle rotation and a lift caused by the velocity profile curvature yu et al 2004 analyzed the saffman force introduced by the fluid rotation u and the magnus force related to the sphere rotation and the velocity difference between the sphere and the fluid at r e t 100 and concluded that it was challenging to establish general formulae to measure lift forces by separately considering each of the effects described by feng et al 1994 the sphere migration at high tube reynolds numbers r e t 2000 was investigated by experiments matas et al 2003 2004b a r e t m a x 2400 and numerical simulations shao et al 2008 r e t m a x 2200 an inner equilibrium position of the particles was observed by matas et al 2004a at r e t 600 when compared to the results of segré and silberberg 1961 the segré silberberg effect disappears at r e t 1500 owing to the strong velocity fluctuations of the particles the system is close to the laminar turbulent transition at this r e t matas et al 2004b it is noteworthy that spheres are almost neutrally buoyant segré and silberberg 1961 patankar et al 2001 schonberg and hinch 1989 matas et al 2004a shao et al 2008 or marginally denser than the fluid jeffrey and pearson 1965 hogg 1994 feng et al 1994 asmolv 1999 yu et al 2004 when considering the sphere migration in poiseuille flow the maximum values of the density ratio between the sphere and fluid ρ r ρ s ρ f where ρ s is the particle density and ρ f is the fluid density were 1 1 and 1 05 in the studies of feng et al 1994 and yu et al 2004 respectively the slip reynolds number r e s v s l i p d ν d is the sphere diameter v s l i p u f v s is the slip velocity where u f is the undisturbed flow velocity in the position of the sphere center v s is the sphere velocity is approximately o 1 or less in previous studies in fact heavy particles we simply define heavy as the density ratio of ρ r 1 1 in upward pipe flows are commonly observed in engineering applications such as those of the pulverized coal ρ r 1 4 in hydraulic transporting systems and the fine ores ρ r 2 0 in vertical lifting systems during deep sea mining the dynamic responses including the path trajectory slip velocity and radial equilibrium position of a heavy particle at different r e t are significant when selecting the pipe flow velocity to transport the particles however the density ratio considered in the previous studies was so small ρ r 1 1 that the industrial applications of the obtained conclusions were limited although the role of density ratio on the sphere migration has been evaluated in quiescent fluid jenny et al 2004 horowitz and williamson 2010 namkoong et al 2008 deloze et al 2012 zhou and dušek 2015 the results cannot be applied directly to the cases of the upward pipe flow consequently a detailed analysis of the migration of heavy spheres in vertical poiseuille flow is required the effects of r e t and ρ r on sphere migration and flow pattern need to be evaluated in this paper the motion of a heavy sphere in poiseuille flow is investigated using direct numerical simulation dns method the overset mesh and the moving computational domain are applied to model the long distance motion of the sphere the influences of r e t on the path trajectory of the sphere and the surrounding wake structures are evaluated at 0 r e t 1998 the density ratio ρ r varies in the range of 1 1 ρ r 4 which covers most of the particle densities in engineering applications the corresponding slip reynolds number is r e s o 10 2 which is larger than that in the literature o 1 and o 10 the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the mathematical formulae are provided in section 2 the computational overview and validation studies are presented in section 3 the results and discussion are described in section 4 finally the concluding remarks are presented in section 5 2 mathematical formulae incompressible flow is governed by the navier stokes n s equations expressed as follows 1 u 0 2 u t u u 1 ρ f p ν 2 u f g where u is the velocity of the fluid p represents the pressure f g denotes the gravitational force ρ f labels the density of the fluid ν is the kinematic viscosity and t is the time the n s equations are discretized using the finite volume method fvm the discretization of each term is formulated by integrating the term over a control volume using gauss s theorem here the second order upwind scheme is used to discretize the convective term the implicit unsteady solver is applied to carry out the transient computation the second order temporal discretization is utilized to obtain more accurate results compared to the first order temporal discretization for each time step the simple semi implicit method for pressure linked equation scheme is adopted to solve the governing equations for the velocity component and the pressure correction equation the six degree of freedom 6dof motion solver is employed to simulate the sphere migration in response to the flow induced forces and gravity

upward poiseuille flow inside a vertical circular tube is considered here the sphere is impelled under gravitational and hydrodynamic forces fig 1 shows the computational domain and the boundary conditions in the present study the diameters of the sphere and circular tube are d and d respectively the diameter ratio between the tube and sphere d d is set as 4 the numerical simulations are conducted by using the cfd code starccm v11 06 which has been widely used to simulate moving objects in the literature romero gomez and richmond 2016 liang and tao 2017 liu et al 2017 chandar et al 2018 at the inlet boundary the poiseuille flow u u m 1 r r 2 is prescribed yang et al 2005 jiang et al 2013 at the outlet boundary the pressure is set to zero and the velocity is specified as a zero normal gradient on the sphere surface the velocity is set as zero to represent the no slip wall condition and the pressure is set as a zero normal gradient on the tube wall a no slip wall boundary condition is applied the initial condition of the flow inside the tube is set as poiseuille flow u u m 1 r r 2 it has been verified that the effects of the boundary on the calculated results are negligible rather than constructing a long computational domain a moving computational domain is used to model the long distance and long time motion of the sphere in the upward flow asao et al 2013 rahmani and wachs 2014 the computational domain is set as moving vertically at a vertical velocity the same as that of the sphere the wall tangential velocity relative to the computational domain is set as the same value albeit in the opposite direction to cancel out the additional velocity and acceleration caused by the moving computational domain owing to the fact that the velocity and acceleration of computational domain are only exerted on the wall boundary rather than each volume cell in the computational domain no additional velocity would be superposed on the poiseuille flow cd adapco 2016 therefore the moving computational domain can be used to simulate the poiseuille flow in an infinitely long tube before conducting the simulations of the sphere migration the poiseuille flow has been validated without the sphere in order to address the rotation and large amplitude horizontal migration of the sphere we adopt the overset mesh scheme which has been widely used for simulating the free fall of cylinders romero gomez and richmond 2016 and spheres deloze et al 2012 koblitz et al 2017 in the published works conceptually the computational domain is discretized into several different meshes that overlap each other the characteristics including the shape and the motion of the meshes are different this feature is useful in problems dealing with large amplitude movement of objects at each time step the meshes do not have to be regenerated or modified thus offering greater flexibility over other mesh techniques such as mesh morphing cd adapco 2016 additionally local grid refinements on the particle surfaces contribute to capturing the viscous boundary layer accurately without appreciably increasing the total grid point count thereby saving the computational costs when compared to the static grid methods koblitz et al 2017 in the present study two sets of meshes are generated a spherical overset mesh containing the moving sphere and a cylindrical background mesh enclosing the entire domain as shown in fig 2 a considering the sphere diameter d the tube diameter d the thickness of boundary layers and the grid resolution near the sphere the spherical overset mesh is designed with a diameter of 3 3 d the center of the overset mesh coincides with the sphere center the overset mesh is overlaid on the background mesh with the outer boundary defined as the overset condition to separate the background mesh into an active part the blue mesh and an inactive part covered by the red overset mesh the flow will be computed in the overset mesh and the active part of the background mesh almost similar to a continuous mesh the flow solutions at the interface overlapping cells the greens cells in fig 2 a are obtained from the interpolation of both the overset and background meshes rather than solving the governing equations directly to establish the connectivity between the meshes fig 2 b shows the algorithm in the overlapping cells the background mesh is in blue whereas the overset mesh is in red two main aspects are considered the flow quantities at the last active overset cell c in fig 2 b and the fluxes through the cell face between c and a the acceptor cell marked by a red hollow circle in fig 2 b a two step overset process is conducted firstly the hole cutting step is conducted to estimate the cells that take part in the flow field calculation secondly the donor search is executed to determine the donor cells n4 n5 and n6 contributing to the acceptor cells a in fig 2 b the flow quantities at the acceptor cell a ϕ a are calculated as ϕ a α i ϕ n i where α i is the interpolation weighting factors and ϕ n i is the flow quantities at donor cells the flow quantities at c are computed based on the usual algebraic representation of the governing equations and involve three neighbor cells from the overset mesh n1 n2 and n3 and three cells from the background mesh n4 n5 and n6 the fluxes through the cell face between c and a are computed in a manner similar as for two active cells more detailed descriptions of the overset mesh scheme are available in the literature cd adapco 2016 hadzic 2006 koblitz et al 2017 in our simulation the computational domain is separated into sets of unstructured trimmed cells a cutaway view of the grid structures is shown in fig 3 a the grids are initially generated with a base size refinements are applied in the zones containing the sphere and the surrounding vortices the prism layer cells cd adapco 2016 are used in the vicinity of the spheres and the pipe wall to capture further details of the flow in the boundary layers in the present study the convective courant number is a maximum of 0 5 in most areas of the computational domain at the beginning of the simulations the sphere is fixed until the flow in the tube is fully developed 3 2 validation study validations of the spatial and temporal resolutions are conducted by evaluating the sedimentation of a sphere in quiescent fluid inside a vertical tube the density ratio ρ r 2 is selected the slip reynolds number r e s is approximately 263 once the sphere is released it accelerates rapidly transit state and finally moves helically fully developed state as shown in fig 7 a both the transit state and the fully developed state of the sphere motion have been compared at four meshes cases a1 a4 and four time step sizes cases b1 b4 the average values of the radial position x h r vertical velocity v z and the magnitude of horizontal velocity v h of the sphere in the fully developed states are summarized in table 1 and table 2 the time histories of the sphere velocities v z and v h in the transit states are compared in fig 4 as shown in table 1 a reasonable convergence is observed in the results of x h r v z and v h in the fully developed states as the increase of mesh elements moreover the time histories of v z and v h in cases a3 and a4 match adequately in the transit states as illustrated in fig 4 a and c respectively when focusing on the time step size highly marginal differences exist in the results in cases b3 a3 and b4 both in the transit states see fig 4 b and d and in the fully developed states see table 2 therefore based on the validations above the spatial resolution in case a3 and the time step size of δ t t 0 1 50 will be used in the following simulations to verify the capability of our numerical method we simulate the sedimentation of a sphere in a vertical tube and compare the calculated sphere migration to the dns results of deloze et al 2012 the initial configuration of our simulations is the same as that of deloze et al 2012 the vertical velocity v z at r e s 189 the corresponding galileo number g 150 which is defined as g ρ r 1 g d 3 ν deloze et al 2012 and the horizontal velocity v x at r e s 213 g 165 are revealed in fig 5 a and fig 5 b respectively the time histories of both v z and v x exhibit favorable agreement with the dns data of deloze et al 2012 in addition the calculated drag coefficients c d f z 1 8 ρ f v z 2 π d 2 of freely falling spheres in a vertical tube has been compared to the experimental data of clift et al 1978 at different r e s as shown in fig 6 marginal differences can be distinguished from the numerical and experimental data from these two validation cases we conclude that the present numerical method is valid for simulating the sphere migration in a vertical tube 4 results and discussion 4 1 sphere migration at different r e t the tube reynolds number r e t is one of the key parameters dominating the motion of a heavy sphere different path trajectories are observed in upward poiseuille flows at different r e t this section describes a series of numerical simulations conducted at r e t 1998 the typical density ratio ρ r 2 is selected the corresponding u m is in the range of 0 u m 4 9 in the present study 4 1 1 five types of path trajectories as shown in fig 7 five types of path trajectories can be observed at different r e t helical falling oscillating falling vertical falling vertical rising and chaotic rising the instantaneous wake structures in the asymptotic states of the sphere motion are presented in fig 8 the vortical structures are identified by the isosurface of the q criterion proposed by hunt et al 1988 5 q 1 2 ω 2 s 2 where s and ω denote the strain and rotation tensors respectively the q criterion has been widely used to represent the three dimensional vortical structures tian et al 2017a b in addition fig 9 shows the streamlines of the flow in the longitudinal section crossing the tube centerline and sphere center of the computational domain here the velocity field is relative to the moving reference frame of the sphere first we consider the helical fall of a heavy sphere in quiescent fluid r e t 0 in a tube as shown in fig 7 a the slip reynolds number is r e s 263 g 203 once the sphere is released the hopf bifurcation breaks the original axisymmetry of the vertical fall deloze et al 2012 the instability gives rise to the helical mode and the surrounding flow results in non zero lift on the sphere leading to the helical trajectories of the sphere in the asymptotic state of the helical fall double threaded wake structures are revealed in fig 8 a the wake near the sphere is approximately planar symmetric which can be reflected in the streamlines near the sphere see fig 9 a the twist of the wake far from the sphere is due to the helical trajectory from the viewpoint of both the trajectories and the wake structures the helical fall in the tube is similar to the steady oblique state of an unconfined freely falling sphere jenny et al 2004 deloze et al 2012 however the oscillations due to the vortex shedding are observed around the mean oblique trajectory when the sphere is released in the unbounded fluid at g 203 and ρ r 2 in the works of jenny et al 2004 the different trajectories indicate that the tube wall has a tendency to suppress vortex shedding behind the sphere incidentally the sphere trajectory in the tube is not always helical it is determined by the density ratio ρ r diameter ratio d d and galileo number g deloze et al 2012 the helical trajectory of the sphere has been broken by the poiseuille flow in the tube following the analysis of feng et al 1994 the mechanisms responsible for the horizontal motion of the sphere are identified as follows a lift caused by the shear flow including the curvature of the velocity profile the magnus force associated with sphere rotation the wall repulsion and a lift force related to r e s notably the effect of r e s has not been proposed by feng et al 1994 and yu et al 2004 owing to the small r e s approximately o 1 in their works at which no lift force would exist if there is no shear in the flow however a lift will be induced by the surrounding flow when r e s 211 even if the sphere is exposed to the homogeneous flow johnson and patel 1999 therefore the lift resulted from the r e s should be considered when the slip reynolds number is large r e s 263 in the present study in the cases of heavy spheres the sphere falls near the tube wall with horizontal oscillations at r e t 269 u m 0 66 as shown in fig 7 b an explanation for the oscillations is that the lift owing to the shear breaks the helical state of a freely falling sphere however can never achieve a static equilibrium with the effects of the sphere rotation the wall repulsion and r e s as shown in fig 9 b the flow field on both sides of the sphere in the longitudinal section is asymmetric vortex shedding can be observed behind the sphere fig 8 b when the vortices shed from the sphere the fluctuations of the lift force are induced leading to horizontal oscillations of the sphere as the increase of the tube reynolds number r e t 669 and 1106 the corresponding flow velocities are u m 1 64 and 2 72 a stable state of the sphere motion corresponding to an equilibrium of lift force can be obtained the sphere moves vertically in the vicinity of the tube wall as shown in fig 7 c and d when compared to the unstable state at r e t 269 a remarkable effect of the shear on the lift is revealed at a higher r e t the shear adjusts the radial position and the rotation of the sphere thus altering the wall repulsion and the magnus force accordingly the fluctuations of lift gradually vanish leading to a stable state finally fig 8 c and d show the wake structures in the vicinity of the sphere and tube wall in the asymptotic state constant double threaded structures of the flow can be observed behind the sphere in addition an annular structure and a pair of wing like structures appear in the front and back respectively of the sphere when flow passes through the gap between the sphere and the wall indicating the repulsive effect of the wall on the sphere as the flow velocity increases continuously r e t 1786 u m 4 38 the path trajectory becomes chaotic fig 7 e owing to the tube reynolds number close to the laminar turbulent transition the flow pattern would be affected strongly by a slight disturbance matas et al 2003 here the sphere blocks the flow in the tube resulting in the chaotic flow field figs 8 e and fig 9 e the sphere is impelled by the chaotic flow in return and moves irregularly 4 1 2 pressure and shear stress distributions in a specific interval of r e t the sphere moves vertically as the flow velocity increases the falling velocity of the sphere decreases gradually and the sphere is finally lifted in this section we focus on the pressure coefficient c p fig 10 and shear stress τ fig 11 on the vertically moving spheres in the fully developed states the vertical and horizontal projections of the pressure coefficient on the sphere surface are represented by c p z and c p h respectively τ z and τ h denote the vertical and horizontal components respectively of the shear stress following the work of feng et al 1994 the pressure and shear stress have been non dimensionalized by 1 2 ρ f u m 2 generally the pressure and shear stress act mainly on the upstream surface of the sphere 90 θ 270 as shown in figs 10 and 11 the pressure is approximately 4 6 times the shear stress this is related to the slip reynolds number r e s 263 at which the shear stress is significant as the flow velocity increases in the tube the non dimensional c p and τ decrease fig 10 a reveals that the maximum pressure coefficient appears at 190 θ 200 the position where the maximum c p appears is regarded as the stagnation point which is slightly shifted backward on the sphere surface as the flow velocity increases the shift of the stagnation point is mainly related to the shear of poiseuille flow the increase of r e t changes the shear the lift owing to the shear impels the sphere to a new equilibrium position the sphere rotation is modified and the wall wake interaction is adjusted therefore the flow in the layers that adhere to the sphere surface is influenced resulting in the modification of the distributions of c p and τ and the shift of the stagnation point as shown in fig 10 b four apparent extreme points of c p h can be observed on the falling sphere surface at r e t 555 and 669 the two extrema close to the tube centerline 180 θ 360 are larger than those close to the tube wall 0 θ 180 indicating that the intensity of the flow in the gap between the sphere and the wall is weaker the flow would pass through the gap smoothly this phenomenon is more conspicuous at larger r e t the extrema close to the wall almost disappear at r e t 1106 and 1207 it is noted that the phenomenon is inconsistent with the results of feng et al 1994 a possible explanation for the difference is the much larger slip reynolds number r e s 263 in the present study at which the wake structures around the sphere are asymmetric even in the infinite homogeneous flow fig 11 a and b show the vertical τ z and horizontal τ h components respectively of the shear stress on the sphere the shear stress is mainly experienced on the upstream surface of the sphere 90 θ 270 similar to the shift of stagnation point the extreme points of τ z and τ h on the sphere are altered at different r e t due to the change of the shear of poiseuille flow two extrema of τ z are observed in fig 11 a the vertical shear stress τ z on the side close to the wall is smaller than that on the side in the vicinity of the tube centerline reflecting the weaker flow intensity in the gap between the sphere and the wall once again although the extrema of τ h on both sides of the sphere are approximate the distribution of τ h is asymmetric since the stagnation point is on the side near the tube centerline 4 1 3 slip velocity and radial equilibrium position the slip velocity and radial equilibrium position of a heavy sphere in poiseuille flow are of more engineering interests when transporting the particles in pipelines fig 12 and fig 13 show the slip velocity v s l i p and the equilibrium position x h r respectively of the sphere at different u m here we use the flow velocity u m rather than r e t to provide an intuitive comparison between the slip velocity the sphere velocity and the flow velocity when referred to the helical and the oscillating trajectories see fig 7 a and b the average radial positions of the sphere in the fully developed states are presented the chaotic states of the spheres are excluded in addition the v s l i p and x h r at ρ r 1 8 and 2 3 are provided as a supplement to the results at ρ r 2 as shown in fig 12 the trends of v s l i p and v z are similar at ρ r 1 8 2 0 and 2 3 the slip velocity of the sphere in poiseuille flow varies in a relatively small interval when u m varies from 0 to 2 96 r e t 1207 before the sphere trajectory becomes chaotic the terminal velocity of the settling sphere in quiescent fluid is v s l i p 1 3 whereas the critical flow velocity which keeps the sphere suspending in the fluid namely the suspending velocity is u m 2 that is to say the sphere will not be lifted by poiseuille flow until u m is much larger than the terminal velocity of the sphere however the conclusion is qualitative and a quantitative relation between the critical flow velocity and ρ r is still required as revealed in fig 13 the equilibrium position of the sphere varies in a wide range of 0 4 x h r 0 66 which is close to the results in the cases of neutrally x h r 0 6 segré and silberberg 1961 and slightly non neutrally buoyant spheres matas et al 2004a jeffrey and pearson 1965 feng et al 1994 however the effects of the shear the sphere rotation and the wall on the heavy sphere are likely to be different from those discussed in the literature feng et al 1994 as the flow velocity increases x h r increases to a maximum value the sphere is closest to the wall and then begins to decrease the maximum equilibrium position appears at u m 2 which corresponds to the suspending velocity in summary r e t is one of the dominating parameters determining the path trajectory of a heavy sphere in poiseuille flow as the increase of r e t five types of path trajectories can be observed helical falling oscillating falling vertical falling vertical rising and chaotic rising the shear of poiseuille flow plays an essential role in the final state of the lift force and the sphere motion the slip velocity v s l i p varies in a marginal interval at a constant ρ r the equilibrium radial position of the sphere is in a range of 0 4 x h r 0 66 at different r e t the critical flow velocity to lift the sphere is larger than the terminal velocity of the sphere 4 2 hydrodynamic forces the sphere migration is determined by the hydrodynamic forces of the flow however it affects the surrounding flow in return the lift force and lateral migration of a non neutrally buoyant sphere have been summarized by feng et al 1994 and yu et al 2004 however at small slip reynolds numbers r e s o 1 as r e s is increased to o 10 2 the principles of these factors are likely to be different in this section the constrained numerical simulations in which various dofs of sphere motion are limited are conducted to investigate the effects of the rotation and translation of a heavy sphere on the hydrodynamic forces in the simulations the density ratio is ρ r 2 the flow velocity is u m 2 72 first the sphere is fixed in the tube with a horizontal deviation of 1 09 d the equilibrium position of the freely moving sphere in poiseuille flow in the positive y direction as shown in fig 14 then the rotation of the sphere is permitted when the sphere motion is fully developed the restrictions on the translational dofs of the sphere motion are removed the hydrodynamic forces the sphere velocity and the equilibrium position are shown in figs 15 17 respectively first the sphere is fixed in poiseuille flow the drag and lift forces are constant in the fully developed state as shown in fig 15 a it is noted that the lift force points toward the tube wall f y 0 indicating that the sphere would move toward the wall once the sphere is released the moment m x 0 tends to make the sphere rotate in the positive x direction the counterclockwise direction as shown in fig 15 b as mentioned in section 4 1 1 the large r e s contributes significantly to the lift force this is reflected by the asymmetric flow field and a steady lift force on the sphere when the sphere is exposed to the homogeneous flow at the same reynolds number johnson and patel 1999 as the sphere is fixed in poiseuille flow the flow velocity on the left side of the sphere near the tube center see fig 14 is larger than that on the right side near the wall indicating the lower pressure on the left side therefore the shear of poiseuille flow has the tendency to impel the sphere to the tube center this tendency will not change when the sphere is released due to the large slip velocity of the heavy sphere feng et al 1994 additionally the flow on the right side of the sphere is affected by the wall the wall wake interaction gives rise to the repulsive effect on the sphere feng et al 1994 the effects of r e s the shear and the wall reach a stable state producing a resultant lift force towards the tube wall once the rotational dofs are permitted the unbalanced m x makes the sphere rotate in the counterclockwise direction ω x 0 see fig 16 b both drag and lift forces increase owing to the sphere rotation it is noteworthy that the increase of the lift force f y is significant and mainly caused by the pressure difference on the sphere surface the contribution of the shear stress is negligible as shown in fig 18 an explanation for the increase of f y is the magnus effect which is related to the angular velocity ω x and slip velocity v s l i p the counterclockwise rotation of the sphere accelerates the fluid on the right near the wall and slows the fluid on the left near the tube creating an additional pressure difference and increasing the lift force toward the tube wall the magnus effect was considered to be small or negligible for neutrally and slightly non neutrally buoyant spheres in upward poiseuille flow owing to the small density ratio and the corresponding r e s feng et al 1994 yu et al 2004 as r e s increases to r e s o 10 2 the magnus force will play an essential role in the horizontal migration of the freely moving sphere in poiseuille flow finally the translational dofs are unlimited and the sphere moves freely in poiseuille flow once the sphere is released it accelerates in the vertical direction owing to the drag force f z and attains a constant vertical velocity v z finally as shown in fig 16 a in the radial direction the sphere moves toward the wall owing to the unbalanced lift force f y however it is immediately exposed to the repulsive wake wall interaction which tends to push the sphere away from the wall meanwhile a negative m x appears see fig 15 b and suppresses the sphere rotation fig 16 b the magnus effect is weakened owing to the decrease of both ω x and the relative velocity between the sphere and the fluid therefore the sphere decelerates rapidly and moves toward the tube center subsequently the wall repulsion decreases as the increase of the gap between the sphere and the wall a positive m x is introduced and impels the sphere to rotate counterclockwise the magnus effect is recovered gradually the sphere decelerates and then moves toward the wall again after several oscillations the effects of the wall the shear the sphere rotation and r e s achieve a balance the sphere reaches a radial equilibrium position in summary the final states of a heavy sphere in poiseuille flow is determined by the combined effects of r e s the shear of poiseuille flow the sphere rotation and the wall the large slip reynolds number r e s owing to the large density ratio ρ r makes significant contributions to the lift force the shear of poiseuille flow tends to push the sphere toward the tube center the magnus effect due to the sphere rotation is significant at r e s o 10 2 and tends to impel the sphere toward the tube wall the repulsive wall wake interaction affects the lift force strongly and pushes the sphere away from the wall additionally the wall has a tendency to suppress the sphere rotation and diminish the magnus effect 4 3 role of density ratio the density ratio ρ r plays an important role in the sphere motion in poiseuille flow as the density ratio increases the slip reynolds number r e s v s l i p d ν changes resulting in different flow field around the sphere the contributions of the shear the wall the sphere rotation and r e s to the final state of the sphere will be altered in this section the sphere motion and the flow field in poiseuille flow are simulated at 1 1 ρ r 4 0 without loss of generality the tube reynolds number r e t 1106 u m 2 72 is selected the calculated vertical velocity v z horizontal velocity v h and angular velocity ω h of the sphere are presented in figs 19 21 respectively owing to the difficulty to measure the directions of v h and ω h in the chaotic state the magnitudes of v h and ω h at ρ r 1 5 are provided as an alternative in figs 20 and 21 the fully developed wake structures at different ρ r are shown in fig 22 in general three types of path trajectories of the sphere are observed at r e t 1106 steady periodic oscillating and chaotic when the density ratio is small ρ r 1 1 and 1 5 the path trajectory of the sphere is chaotic the vertical velocity v z varies randomly within a certain range fig 19 the horizontal and angular velocities are irregular figs 20 and 21 the wake structures around the sphere are disordered as shown in fig 22 a the slip reynolds number at ρ r 1 5 is approximate 220 the lift introduced by r e s is much smaller and has a weaker effect on the sphere when compared to the case of ρ r 2 r e s 263 johnson and patel 1999 due to the small inertia of the sphere at ρ r 1 5 the sphere motion will be affected by any small perturbations once the sphere is released it moves away from the tube center and oscillates in the flow the oscillations of the released sphere disrupt the flow in the tube the lift related to the shear becomes chaotic and will never be balanced by the effects of r e s the sphere rotation and the wall the flow and the sphere motion will never obtain stable states as the density ratio increases ρ r 1 8 2 0 and 2 3 the sphere moves vertically in a radial equilibrium position see figs 19 and 20 and rotates at a constant angular velocity see fig 21 in the final state fig 22 b reveals the constant wake structures which have been described in section 4 1 1 the equilibrium state is related to the larger inertia of the sphere and the effect of a larger r e s which overwhelms the lift caused by the shear finally the effects of all the factors attain the balance leading to stable states of the sphere and the flow field at ρ r 2 5 3 0 and 4 0 the periodic oscillations of the sphere velocity including v z v h and ω h are observed in figs 19 21 the vortex shedding behind the sphere is revealed in fig 22 c the average slip reynolds number at ρ r 2 5 is r e s 320 at which the periodic vortex shedding appears behind the sphere in the case of flow past a sphere johnson and patel 1999 it is reasonable to believe that the effect of r e s plays a dominating role in the lift force thereby resulting in the periodic oscillations of the sphere although the frequency of the vortex shedding is different from that of flow past a fixed sphere 5 concluding remarks a heavy sphere moving in upward poiseuille flow is numerically investigated using dns method the overset mesh and the moving computation domain are utilized to address the long distance motion of the sphere we mainly focus on the dynamic responses of the sphere including the path trajectory the slip velocity and the radial equilibrium position in the tube the flow patterns and the hydrodynamic forces are revealed the effect of the tube reynolds number r e t on the heavy sphere ρ r 2 is evaluated with r e t up to 1998 a wide range of density ratio 1 1 ρ r 4 is selected to investigate the role of density on sphere migration in poiseuille flow the corresponding slip reynolds number is r e s o 10 2 the results are likely to provide potential guidance on selecting the flow velocity to transport the heavy particles in vertical pipes the main conclusions are drawn as follows 1 dependent on the tube reynolds number five types of path trajectories of the heavy sphere ρ r 2 are observed helical falling oscillating falling vertical falling vertical rising and chaotic rising 2 the slip velocity changes marginally with tube reynolds number r e t at a constant ρ r the sphere will be lifted when the flow velocity u m is larger than a critical value the radial equilibrium position of the sphere at ρ r 2 varies in a wide range of 0 4 x h r 0 66 the largest x h r corresponds to the suspending state of a sphere in poiseuille flow 3 different from the neutrally and slightly non neutrally buoyant spheres a heavy sphere gives rise to a much larger slip reynolds number r e s which effects the lift force and the final state of sphere motion significantly the lift force associated with the rotation of a heavy sphere is much larger than that in the cases of neutrally and slightly non neutrally buoyant spheres the shear tends to push the sphere toward the tube center the wall repulsion contributes substantially to the horizontal migration of the sphere and exhibits the tendency to suppress the sphere rotation the final states of the sphere are affected by the slip reynolds number r e s the shear of poiseuille flow the sphere rotation and the wall repulsion 4 the density ratio plays a significant role in the dynamic responses

density ratio 1 introduction freely moving particles in pipe flows are commonly observed in industrial flows examples are ores in lifting pipes in deep sea mining and pulverized coal in conveying pipelines the particle migration in tube flows is a classic issue in fluid mechanics particularly in two phase flow in the 1960s segré and silberberg 1961 discovered that the dilute suspended neutrally buoyant spheres in tube flows migrate away from both the wall and the centerline and accumulate at a radial position of approximately 0 6 times the tube radius namely the segré silberberg effect numerous experimental and theoretical works have been conducted to verify and explain the particle migration in a tube jeffrey and pearson 1965 karnis et al 1966 schonberg and hinch 1989 asmolv 1999 comprehensive reviews of theoretical and experimental studies have been presented by brenner 1966 cox and mason 1971 and leal 1980 in early years as one of the simplest shear flows in tubes the poiseuille flow with velocity profile defined as u u m 1 r r 2 u m is the maximum flow velocity in the tube center r is the radial position and r is the radius of the tube has been widely considered in previous studies when investigating particle migration in tubes generally the spherical particles have been selected the tube reynolds number r e t u m r ν ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid is one of the key factors affecting the particle motion and flow pattern in the tube analytical expressions have already been provided by numerous researchers since the 1960s bretherton 1962 saffman 1965 asmolv 1999 however the results were mostly based on perturbing stokes flow or potential flow which limited the applications of the expressions feng et al 1994 investigated the migration of a two dimensional circular particle in poiseuille flow at r e t o 10 r e t m a x 120 by numerical simulations focusing on the axial and radial migration of the sphere and the lift force four types of contributions to the lift force were distinguished a wall repulsion owing to lubrication an inertial lift related to shear slip a lift owing to particle rotation and a lift caused by the velocity profile curvature yu et al 2004 analyzed the saffman force introduced by the fluid rotation u and the magnus force related to the sphere rotation and the velocity difference between the sphere and the fluid at r e t 100 and concluded that it was challenging to establish general formulae to measure lift forces by separately considering each of the effects described by feng et al 1994 the sphere migration at high tube reynolds numbers r e t 2000 was investigated by experiments matas et al 2003 2004b a r e t m a x 2400 and numerical simulations shao et al 2008 r e t m a x 2200 an inner equilibrium position of the particles was observed by matas et al 2004a at r e t 600 when compared to the results of segré and silberberg 1961 the segré silberberg effect disappears at r e t 1500 owing to the strong velocity fluctuations of the particles the system is close to the laminar turbulent transition at this r e t matas et al 2004b it is noteworthy that spheres are almost neutrally buoyant segré and silberberg 1961 patankar et al 2001 schonberg and hinch 1989 matas et al 2004a shao et al 2008 or marginally denser than the fluid jeffrey and pearson 1965 hogg 1994 feng et al 1994 asmolv 1999 yu et al 2004 when considering the sphere migration in poiseuille flow the maximum values of the density ratio between the sphere and fluid ρ r ρ s ρ f where ρ s is the particle density and ρ f is the fluid density were 1 1 and 1 05 in the studies of feng et al 1994 and yu et al 2004 respectively the slip reynolds number r e s v s l i p d ν d is the sphere diameter v s l i p u f v s is the slip velocity where u f is the undisturbed flow velocity in the position of the sphere center v s is the sphere velocity is approximately o 1 or less in previous studies in fact heavy particles we simply define heavy as the density ratio of ρ r 1 1 in upward pipe flows are commonly observed in engineering applications such as those of the pulverized coal ρ r 1 4 in hydraulic transporting systems and the fine ores ρ r 2 0 in vertical lifting systems during deep sea mining the dynamic responses including the path trajectory slip velocity and radial equilibrium position of a heavy particle at different r e t are significant when selecting the pipe flow velocity to transport the particles however the density ratio considered in the previous studies was so small ρ r 1 1 that the industrial applications of the obtained conclusions were limited although the role of density ratio on the sphere migration has been evaluated in quiescent fluid jenny et al 2004 horowitz and williamson 2010 namkoong et al 2008 deloze et al 2012 zhou and dušek 2015 the results cannot be applied directly to the cases of the upward pipe flow consequently a detailed analysis of the migration of heavy spheres in vertical poiseuille flow is required the effects of r e t and ρ r on sphere migration and flow pattern need to be evaluated in this paper the motion of a heavy sphere in poiseuille flow is investigated using direct numerical simulation dns method the overset mesh and the moving computational domain are applied to model the long distance motion of the sphere the influences of r e t on the path trajectory of the sphere and the surrounding wake structures are evaluated at 0 r e t 1998 the density ratio ρ r varies in the range of 1 1 ρ r 4 which covers most of the particle densities in engineering applications the corresponding slip reynolds number is r e s o 10 2 which is larger than that in the literature o 1 and o 10 the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the mathematical formulae are provided in section 2 the computational overview and validation studies are presented in section 3 the results and discussion are described in section 4 finally the concluding remarks are presented in section 5 2 mathematical formulae incompressible flow is governed by the navier stokes n s equations expressed as follows 1 u 0 2 u t u u 1 ρ f p ν 2 u f g where u is the velocity of the fluid p represents the pressure f g denotes the gravitational force ρ f labels the density of the fluid ν is the kinematic viscosity and t is the time the n s equations are discretized using the finite volume method fvm the discretization of each term is formulated by integrating the term over a control volume using gauss s theorem here the second order upwind scheme is used to discretize the convective term the implicit unsteady solver is applied to carry out the transient computation the second order temporal discretization is utilized to obtain more accurate results compared to the first order temporal discretization for each time step the simple semi implicit method for pressure linked equation scheme is adopted to solve the governing equations for the velocity component and the pressure correction equation the six degree of freedom 6dof motion solver is employed to simulate the sphere migration in response to the flow induced forces and gravity first the resultant forces acting on the sphere are calculated and are used to solve the governing equations of sphere motion 3 m d v d t f 4 a d ω d t ω a ω m where m represents the sphere mass v demotes the velocity of the sphere center a is the tensor of the moments of inertia and ω is the angular velocity of the sphere f and m are the resultant force and moment respectively on the sphere in this study the dimensionless forms of the calculated results are used the reference scales used to non dimensionalize the results are as follows l 0 d for length v 0 ρ r 1 g d for velocity ω 0 ρ r 1 g

upward poiseuille flow inside a vertical circular tube is considered here the sphere is impelled under gravitational and hydrodynamic forces fig 1 shows the computational domain and the boundary conditions in the present study the diameters of the sphere and circular tube are d and d respectively the diameter ratio between the tube and sphere d d is set as 4 the numerical simulations are conducted by using the cfd code starccm v11 06 which has been widely used to simulate moving objects in the literature romero gomez and richmond 2016 liang and tao 2017 liu et al 2017 chandar et al 2018 at the inlet boundary the poiseuille flow u u m 1 r r 2 is prescribed yang et al 2005 jiang et al 2013 at the outlet boundary the pressure is set to zero and the velocity is specified as a zero normal gradient on the sphere surface the velocity is set as zero to represent the no slip wall condition and the pressure is set as a zero normal gradient on the tube wall a no slip wall boundary condition is applied the initial condition of the flow inside the tube is set as poiseuille flow u u m 1 r r 2 it has been verified that the effects of the boundary on the calculated results are negligible rather than constructing a long computational domain a moving computational domain is used to model the long distance and long time motion of the sphere in the upward flow asao et al 2013 rahmani and wachs 2014 the computational domain is set as moving vertically at a vertical velocity the same as that of the sphere the wall tangential velocity relative to the computational domain is set as the same value albeit in the opposite direction to cancel out the additional velocity and acceleration caused by the moving computational domain owing to the fact that the velocity and acceleration of computational domain are only exerted on the wall boundary rather than each volume cell in the computational domain no additional velocity would be superposed on the poiseuille flow cd adapco 2016 therefore the moving computational domain can be used to simulate the poiseuille flow in an infinitely long tube before conducting the simulations of the sphere migration the poiseuille flow has been validated without the sphere in order to address the rotation and large amplitude horizontal migration of the sphere we adopt the overset mesh scheme which has been widely used for simulating the free fall of cylinders romero gomez and richmond 2016 and spheres deloze et al 2012 koblitz et al 2017 in the published works conceptually the computational domain is discretized into several different meshes that overlap each other the characteristics including the shape and the motion of the meshes are different this feature is useful in problems dealing with large amplitude movement of objects at each time step the meshes do not have to be regenerated or modified thus offering greater flexibility over other mesh techniques such as mesh morphing cd adapco 2016 additionally local grid refinements on the particle surfaces contribute to capturing the viscous boundary layer accurately without appreciably increasing the total grid point count thereby saving the computational costs when compared to the static grid methods koblitz et al 2017 in the present study two sets of meshes are generated a spherical overset mesh containing the moving sphere and a cylindrical background mesh enclosing the entire domain as shown in fig 2 a considering the sphere diameter d the tube diameter d the thickness of boundary layers and the grid resolution near the sphere the spherical overset mesh is designed with a diameter of 3 3 d the center of the overset mesh coincides with the sphere center the overset mesh is overlaid on the background mesh with the outer boundary defined as the overset condition to separate the background mesh into an active part the blue mesh and an inactive part covered by the red overset mesh the flow will be computed in the overset mesh and the active part of the background mesh almost similar to a continuous mesh the flow solutions at the interface overlapping cells the greens cells in fig 2 a are obtained from the interpolation of both the overset and background meshes rather than solving the governing equations directly to establish the connectivity between the meshes fig 2 b shows the algorithm in the overlapping cells the background mesh is in blue whereas the overset mesh is in red two main aspects are considered the flow quantities at the last active overset cell c in fig 2 b and the fluxes through the cell face between c and a the acceptor cell marked by a red hollow circle in fig 2 b a two step overset process is conducted firstly the hole cutting step is conducted to estimate the cells that take part in the flow field calculation secondly the donor search is executed to determine the donor cells n4 n5 and n6 contributing to the acceptor cells a in fig 2 b the flow quantities at the acceptor cell a ϕ a are calculated as ϕ a α i ϕ n i where α i is the interpolation weighting factors and ϕ n i is the flow quantities at donor cells the flow quantities at c are computed based on the usual algebraic representation of the governing equations and involve three neighbor cells from the overset mesh n1 n2 and n3 and three cells from the background mesh n4 n5 and n6 the fluxes through the cell face between c and a are computed in a manner similar as for two active cells more detailed descriptions of the overset mesh scheme are available in the literature cd adapco 2016 hadzic 2006 koblitz et al 2017 in our simulation the computational domain is separated into sets of unstructured trimmed cells a cutaway view of the grid structures is shown in fig 3 a the grids are initially generated with a base size refinements are applied in the zones containing the sphere and the surrounding vortices the prism layer cells cd adapco 2016 are used in the vicinity of the spheres and the pipe wall to capture further details of the flow in the boundary layers in the present study the convective courant number is a maximum of 0 5 in most areas of the computational domain at the beginning of the simulations the sphere is fixed until the flow in the tube is fully developed 3 2 validation study validations of the spatial and temporal resolutions are conducted by evaluating the sedimentation of a sphere in quiescent fluid inside a vertical tube the density ratio ρ r 2 is selected the slip reynolds number r e s is approximately 263 once the sphere is released it accelerates rapidly transit state and finally moves helically fully developed state as shown in fig 7 a both the transit state and the fully developed state of the sphere motion have been compared at four meshes cases a1 a4 and four time step sizes cases b1 b4 the average values of the radial position x h r vertical velocity v z and the magnitude of horizontal velocity v h of the sphere in the fully developed states are summarized in table 1 and table 2 the time histories of the sphere velocities v z and v h in the transit states are compared in fig 4 as shown in table 1 a reasonable convergence is observed in the results of x h r v z and v h in the fully developed states as the increase of mesh elements moreover the time histories of v z and v h in cases a3 and a4 match adequately in the transit states as illustrated in fig 4 a and c respectively when focusing on the time step size highly marginal differences exist in the results in cases b3 a3 and b4 both in the transit states see fig 4 b and d and in the fully developed states see table 2 therefore based on the validations above the spatial resolution in case a3 and the time step size of δ t t 0 1 50 will be used in the following simulations to verify the capability of our numerical method we simulate the sedimentation of a sphere in a vertical tube and compare the calculated sphere migration to the dns results of deloze et al 2012 the initial configuration of our simulations is the same as that of deloze et al 2012 the vertical velocity v z at r e s 189 the corresponding galileo number g 150 which is defined as g ρ r 1 g d 3 ν deloze et al 2012 and the horizontal velocity v x at r e s 213 g 165 are revealed in fig 5 a and fig 5 b respectively the time histories of both v z and v x exhibit favorable agreement with the dns data of deloze et al 2012 in addition the calculated drag coefficients c d f z 1 8 ρ f v z 2 π d 2 of freely falling spheres in a vertical tube has been compared to the experimental data of clift et al 1978 at different r e s as shown in fig 6 marginal differences can be distinguished from the numerical and experimental data from these two validation cases we conclude that the present numerical method is valid for simulating the sphere migration in a vertical tube 4 results and discussion 4 1 sphere migration at different r e t the tube reynolds number r e t is one of the key parameters dominating the motion of a heavy sphere different path trajectories are observed in upward poiseuille flows at different r e t this section describes a series of numerical simulations conducted at r e t 1998 the typical density ratio ρ r 2 is selected the corresponding u m is in the range of 0 u m 4 9 in the present study 4 1 1 five types of path trajectories as shown in fig 7 five types of path trajectories can be observed at different r e t helical falling oscillating falling vertical falling vertical rising and chaotic rising the instantaneous wake structures in the asymptotic states of the sphere motion are presented in fig 8 the vortical structures are identified by the isosurface of the q criterion proposed by hunt et al 1988 5 q 1 2 ω 2 s 2 where s and ω denote the strain and rotation tensors respectively the q criterion has been widely used to represent the three dimensional vortical structures tian et al 2017a b in addition fig 9 shows the streamlines of the flow in the longitudinal section crossing the tube centerline and sphere center of the computational domain here the velocity field is relative to the moving reference frame of the sphere first we consider the helical fall of a heavy sphere in quiescent fluid r e t 0 in a tube as shown in fig 7 a the slip reynolds number is r e s 263 g 203 once the sphere is released the hopf bifurcation breaks the original axisymmetry of the vertical fall deloze et al 2012 the instability gives rise to the helical mode and the surrounding flow results in non zero lift on the sphere leading to the helical trajectories of the sphere in the asymptotic state of the helical fall double threaded wake structures are revealed in fig 8 a the wake near the sphere is approximately planar symmetric which can be reflected in the streamlines near the sphere see fig 9 a the twist of the wake far from the sphere is due to the helical trajectory from the viewpoint of both the trajectories and the wake structures the helical fall in the tube is similar to the steady oblique state of an unconfined freely falling sphere jenny et al 2004 deloze et al 2012 however the oscillations due to the vortex shedding are observed around the mean oblique trajectory when the sphere is released in the unbounded fluid at g 203 and ρ r 2 in the works of jenny et al 2004 the different trajectories indicate that the tube wall has a tendency to suppress vortex shedding behind the sphere incidentally the sphere trajectory in the tube is not always helical it is determined by the density ratio ρ r diameter ratio d d and galileo number g deloze et al 2012 the helical trajectory of the sphere has been broken by the poiseuille flow in the tube following the analysis of feng et al 1994 the mechanisms responsible for the horizontal motion of the sphere are identified as follows a lift caused by the shear flow including the curvature of the velocity profile the magnus force associated with sphere rotation the wall repulsion and a lift force related to r e s notably the effect of r e s has not been proposed by feng et al 1994 and yu et al 2004 owing to the small r e s approximately o 1 in their works at which no lift force would exist if there is no shear in the flow however a lift will be induced by the surrounding flow when r e s 211 even if the sphere is exposed to the homogeneous flow johnson and patel 1999 therefore the lift resulted from the r e s should be considered when the slip reynolds number is large r e s 263 in the present study in the cases of heavy spheres the sphere falls near the tube wall with horizontal oscillations at r e t 269 u m 0 66 as shown in fig 7 b an explanation for the oscillations is that the lift owing to the shear breaks the helical state of a freely falling sphere however can never achieve a static equilibrium with the effects of the sphere rotation the wall repulsion and r e s as shown in fig 9 b the flow field on both sides of the sphere in the longitudinal section is asymmetric vortex shedding can be observed behind the sphere fig 8 b when the vortices shed from the sphere the fluctuations of the lift force are induced leading to horizontal oscillations of the sphere as the increase of the tube reynolds number r e t 669 and 1106 the corresponding flow velocities are u m 1 64 and 2 72 a stable state of the sphere motion corresponding to an equilibrium of lift force can be obtained the sphere moves vertically in the vicinity of the tube wall as shown in fig 7 c and d when compared to the unstable state at r e t 269 a remarkable effect of the shear on the lift is revealed at a higher r e t the shear adjusts the radial position and the rotation of the sphere thus altering the wall repulsion and the magnus force accordingly the fluctuations of lift gradually vanish leading to a stable state finally fig 8 c and d show the wake structures in the vicinity of the sphere and tube wall in the asymptotic state constant double threaded structures of the flow can be observed behind the sphere in addition an annular structure and a pair of wing like structures appear in the front and back respectively of the sphere when flow passes through the gap between the sphere and the wall indicating the repulsive effect of the wall on the sphere as the flow velocity increases continuously r e t 1786 u m 4 38 the path trajectory becomes chaotic fig 7 e owing to the tube reynolds number close to the laminar turbulent transition the flow pattern would be affected strongly by a slight disturbance matas et al 2003 here the sphere blocks the flow in the tube resulting in the chaotic flow field figs 8 e and fig 9 e the sphere is impelled by the chaotic flow in return and moves irregularly 4 1 2 pressure and shear stress distributions in a specific interval of r e t the sphere moves vertically as the flow velocity increases the falling velocity of the sphere decreases gradually and the sphere is finally lifted in this section we focus on the pressure coefficient c p fig 10 and shear stress τ fig 11 on the vertically moving spheres in the fully developed states the vertical and horizontal projections of the pressure coefficient on the sphere surface are represented by c p z and c p h respectively τ z and τ h denote the vertical and horizontal components respectively of the shear stress following the work of feng et al 1994 the pressure and shear stress have been non dimensionalized by 1 2 ρ f u m 2 generally the pressure and shear stress act mainly on the upstream surface of the sphere 90 θ 270 as shown in figs 10 and 11 the pressure is approximately 4 6 times the shear stress this is related to the slip reynolds number r e s 263 at which the shear stress is significant as the flow velocity increases in the tube the non dimensional c p and τ decrease fig 10 a reveals that the maximum pressure coefficient appears at 190 θ 200 the position where the maximum c p appears is regarded as the stagnation point which is slightly shifted backward on the sphere surface as the flow velocity increases the shift of the stagnation point is mainly related to the shear of poiseuille flow the increase of r e t changes the shear the lift owing to the shear impels the sphere to a new equilibrium position the sphere rotation is modified and the wall wake interaction is adjusted therefore the flow in the layers that adhere to the sphere surface is influenced resulting in the modification of the distributions of c p and τ and the shift of the stagnation point as shown in fig 10 b four apparent extreme points of c p h can be observed on the falling sphere surface at r e t 555 and 669 the two extrema close to the tube centerline 180 θ 360 are larger than those close to the tube wall 0 θ 180 indicating that the intensity of the flow in the gap between the sphere and the wall is weaker the flow would pass through the gap smoothly this phenomenon is more conspicuous at larger r e t the extrema close to the wall almost disappear at r e t 1106 and 1207 it is noted that the phenomenon is inconsistent with the results of feng et al 1994 a possible explanation for the difference is the much larger slip reynolds number r e s 263 in the present study at which the wake structures around the sphere are asymmetric even in the infinite homogeneous flow fig 11 a and b show the vertical τ z and horizontal τ h components respectively of the shear stress on the sphere the shear stress is mainly experienced on the upstream surface of the sphere 90 θ 270 similar to the shift of stagnation point the extreme points of τ z and τ h on the sphere are altered at different r e t due to the change of the shear of poiseuille flow two extrema of τ z are observed in fig 11 a the vertical shear stress τ z on the side close to the wall is smaller than that on the side in the vicinity of the tube centerline reflecting the weaker flow intensity in the gap between the sphere and the wall once again although the extrema of τ h on both sides of the sphere are approximate the distribution of τ h is asymmetric since the stagnation point is on the side near the tube centerline 4 1 3 slip velocity and radial equilibrium position the slip velocity and radial equilibrium position of a heavy sphere in poiseuille flow are of more engineering interests when transporting the particles in pipelines fig 12 and fig 13 show the slip velocity v s l i p and the equilibrium position x h r respectively of the sphere at different u m here we use the flow velocity u m rather than r e t to provide an intuitive comparison between the slip velocity the sphere velocity and the flow velocity when referred to the helical and the oscillating trajectories see fig 7 a and b the average radial positions of the sphere in the fully developed states are presented the chaotic states of the spheres are excluded in addition the v s l i p and x h r at ρ r 1 8 and 2 3 are provided as a supplement to the results at ρ r 2 as shown in fig 12 the trends of v s l i p and v z are similar at ρ r 1 8 2 0 and 2 3 the slip velocity of the sphere in poiseuille flow varies in a relatively small interval when u m varies from 0 to 2 96 r e t 1207 before the sphere trajectory becomes chaotic the terminal velocity of the settling sphere in quiescent fluid is v s l i p 1 3 whereas the critical flow velocity which keeps the sphere suspending in the fluid namely the suspending velocity is u m 2 that is to say the sphere will not be lifted by poiseuille flow until u m is much larger than the terminal velocity of the sphere however the conclusion is qualitative and a quantitative relation between the critical flow velocity and ρ r is still required as revealed in fig 13 the equilibrium position of the sphere varies in a wide range of 0 4 x h r 0 66 which is close to the results in the cases of neutrally x h r 0 6 segré and silberberg 1961 and slightly non neutrally buoyant spheres matas et al 2004a jeffrey and pearson 1965 feng et al 1994 however the effects of the shear the sphere rotation and the wall on the heavy sphere are likely to be different from those discussed in the literature feng et al 1994 as the flow velocity increases x h r increases to a maximum value the sphere is closest to the wall and then begins to decrease the maximum equilibrium position appears at u m 2 which corresponds to the suspending velocity in summary r e t is one of the dominating parameters determining the path trajectory of a heavy sphere in poiseuille flow as the increase of r e t five types of path trajectories can be observed helical falling oscillating falling vertical falling vertical rising and chaotic rising the shear of poiseuille flow plays an essential role in the final state of the lift force and the sphere motion the slip velocity v s l i p varies in a marginal interval at a constant ρ r the equilibrium radial position of the sphere is in a range of 0 4 x h r 0 66 at different r e t the critical flow velocity to lift the sphere is larger than the terminal velocity of the sphere 4 2 hydrodynamic forces the sphere migration is determined by the hydrodynamic forces of the flow however it affects the surrounding flow in return the lift force and lateral migration of a non neutrally buoyant sphere have been summarized by feng et al 1994 and yu et al 2004 however at small slip reynolds numbers r e s o 1 as r e s is increased to o 10 2 the principles of these factors are likely to be different in this section the constrained numerical simulations in which various dofs of sphere motion are limited are conducted to investigate the effects of the rotation and translation of a heavy sphere on the hydrodynamic forces in the simulations the density ratio is ρ r 2 the flow velocity is u m 2 72 first the sphere is fixed in the tube with a horizontal deviation of 1 09 d the equilibrium position of the freely moving sphere in poiseuille flow in the positive y direction as shown in fig 14 then the rotation of the sphere is permitted when the sphere motion is fully developed the restrictions on the translational dofs of the sphere motion are removed the hydrodynamic forces the sphere velocity and the equilibrium position are shown in figs 15 17 respectively first the sphere is fixed in poiseuille flow the drag and lift forces are constant in the fully developed state as shown in fig 15 a it is noted that the lift force points toward the tube wall f y 0 indicating that the sphere would move toward the wall once the sphere is released the moment m x 0 tends to make the sphere rotate in the positive x direction the counterclockwise direction as shown in fig 15 b as mentioned in section 4 1 1 the large r e s contributes significantly to the lift force this is reflected by the asymmetric flow field and a steady lift force on the sphere when the sphere is exposed to the homogeneous flow at the same reynolds number johnson and patel 1999 as the sphere is fixed in poiseuille flow the flow velocity on the left side of the sphere near the tube center see fig 14 is larger than that on the right side near the wall indicating the lower pressure on the left side therefore the shear of poiseuille flow has the tendency to impel the sphere to the tube center this tendency will not change when the sphere is released due to the large slip velocity of the heavy sphere feng et al 1994 additionally the flow on the right side of the sphere is affected by the wall the wall wake interaction gives rise to the repulsive effect on the sphere feng et al 1994 the effects of r e s the shear and the wall reach a stable state producing a resultant lift force towards the tube wall once the rotational dofs are permitted the unbalanced m x makes the sphere rotate in the counterclockwise direction ω x 0 see fig 16 b both drag and lift forces increase owing to the sphere rotation it is noteworthy that the increase of the lift force f y is significant and mainly caused by the pressure difference on the sphere surface the contribution of the shear stress is negligible as shown in fig 18 an explanation for the increase of f y is the magnus effect which is related to the angular velocity ω x and slip velocity v s l i p the counterclockwise rotation of the sphere accelerates the fluid on the right near the wall and slows the fluid on the left near the tube creating an additional pressure difference and increasing the lift force toward the tube wall the magnus effect was considered to be small or negligible for neutrally and slightly non neutrally buoyant spheres in upward poiseuille flow owing to the small density ratio and the corresponding r e s feng et al 1994 yu et al 2004 as r e s increases to r e s o 10 2 the magnus force will play an essential role in the horizontal migration of the freely moving sphere in poiseuille flow finally the translational dofs are unlimited and the sphere moves freely in poiseuille flow once the sphere is released it accelerates in the vertical direction owing to the drag force f z and attains a constant vertical velocity v z finally as shown in fig 16 a in the radial direction the sphere moves toward the wall owing to the unbalanced lift force f y however it is immediately exposed to the repulsive wake wall interaction which tends to push the sphere away from the wall meanwhile a negative m x appears see fig 15 b and suppresses the sphere rotation fig 16 b the magnus effect is weakened owing to the decrease of both ω x and the relative velocity between the sphere and the fluid therefore the sphere decelerates rapidly and moves toward the tube center subsequently the wall repulsion decreases as the increase of the gap between the sphere and the wall a positive m x is introduced and impels the sphere to rotate counterclockwise the magnus effect is recovered gradually the sphere decelerates and then moves toward the wall again after several oscillations the effects of the wall the shear the sphere rotation and r e s achieve a balance the sphere reaches a radial equilibrium position in summary the final states of a heavy sphere in poiseuille flow is determined by the combined effects of r e s the shear of poiseuille flow the sphere rotation and the wall the large slip reynolds number r e s owing to the large density ratio ρ r makes significant contributions to the lift force the shear of poiseuille flow tends to push the sphere toward the tube center the magnus effect due to the sphere rotation is significant at r e s o 10 2 and tends to impel the sphere toward the tube wall the repulsive wall wake interaction affects the lift force strongly and pushes the sphere away from the wall additionally the wall has a tendency to suppress the sphere rotation and diminish the magnus effect 4 3 role of density ratio the density ratio ρ r plays an important role in the sphere motion in poiseuille flow as the density ratio increases the slip reynolds number r e s v s l i p d ν changes resulting in different flow field around the sphere the contributions of the shear the wall the sphere rotation and r e s to the final state of the sphere will be altered in this section the sphere motion and the flow field in poiseuille flow are simulated at 1 1 ρ r 4 0 without loss of generality the tube reynolds number r e t 1106 u m 2 72 is selected the calculated vertical velocity v z horizontal velocity v h and angular velocity ω h of the sphere are presented in figs 19 21 respectively owing to the difficulty to measure the directions of v h and ω h in the chaotic state the magnitudes of v h and ω h at ρ r 1 5 are provided as an alternative in figs 20 and 21 the fully developed wake structures at different ρ r are shown in fig 22 in general three types of path trajectories of the sphere are observed at r e t 1106 steady periodic oscillating and chaotic when the density ratio is small ρ r 1 1 and 1 5 the path trajectory of the sphere is chaotic the vertical velocity v z varies randomly within a certain range fig 19 the horizontal and angular velocities are irregular figs 20 and 21 the wake structures around the sphere are disordered as shown in fig 22 a the slip reynolds number at ρ r 1 5 is approximate 220 the lift introduced by r e s is much smaller and has a weaker effect on the sphere when compared to the case of ρ r 2 r e s 263 johnson and patel 1999 due to the small inertia of the sphere at ρ r 1 5 the sphere motion will be affected by any small perturbations once the sphere is released it moves away from the tube center and oscillates in the flow the oscillations of the released sphere disrupt the flow in the tube the lift related to the shear becomes chaotic and will never be balanced by the effects of r e s the sphere rotation and the wall the flow and the sphere motion will never obtain stable states as the density ratio increases ρ r 1 8 2 0 and 2 3 the sphere moves vertically in a radial equilibrium position see figs 19 and 20 and rotates at a constant angular velocity see fig 21 in the final state fig 22 b reveals the constant wake structures which have been described in section 4 1 1 the equilibrium state is related to the larger inertia of the sphere and the effect of a larger r e s which overwhelms the lift caused by the shear finally the effects of all the factors attain the balance leading to stable states of the sphere and the flow field at ρ r 2 5 3 0 and 4 0 the periodic oscillations of the sphere velocity including v z v h and ω h are observed in figs 19 21 the vortex shedding behind the sphere is revealed in fig 22 c the average slip reynolds number at ρ r 2 5 is r e s 320 at which the periodic vortex shedding appears behind the sphere in the case of flow past a sphere johnson and patel 1999 it is reasonable to believe that the effect of r e s plays a dominating role in the lift force thereby resulting in the periodic oscillations of the sphere although the frequency of the vortex shedding is different from that of flow past a fixed sphere 5 concluding remarks a heavy sphere moving in upward poiseuille flow is numerically investigated using dns method the overset mesh and the moving computation domain are utilized to address the long distance motion of the sphere we mainly focus on the dynamic responses of the sphere including the path trajectory the slip velocity and the radial equilibrium position in the tube the flow patterns and the hydrodynamic forces are revealed the effect of the tube reynolds number r e t on the heavy sphere ρ r 2 is evaluated with r e t up to 1998 a wide range of density ratio 1 1 ρ r 4 is selected to investigate the role of density on sphere migration in poiseuille flow the corresponding slip reynolds number is r e s o 10 2 the results are likely to provide potential guidance on selecting the flow velocity to transport the heavy particles in vertical pipes the main conclusions are drawn as follows 1 dependent on the tube reynolds number five types of path trajectories of the heavy sphere ρ r 2 are observed helical falling oscillating falling vertical falling vertical rising and chaotic rising 2 the slip velocity changes marginally with tube reynolds number r e t at a constant ρ r the sphere will be lifted when the flow velocity u m is larger than a critical value the radial equilibrium position of the sphere at ρ r 2 varies in a wide range of 0 4 x h r 0 66 the largest x h r corresponds to the suspending state of a sphere in poiseuille flow 3 different from the neutrally and slightly non neutrally buoyant spheres a heavy sphere gives rise to a much larger slip reynolds number r e s which effects the lift force and the final state of sphere motion significantly the lift force associated with the rotation of a heavy sphere is much larger than that in the cases of neutrally and slightly non neutrally buoyant spheres the shear tends to push the sphere toward the tube center the wall repulsion contributes substantially to the horizontal migration of the sphere and exhibits the tendency to suppress the sphere rotation the final states of the sphere are affected by the slip reynolds number r e s the shear of poiseuille flow the sphere rotation and the wall repulsion 4 the density ratio plays a significant role in the dynamic responses of a heavy sphere in poiseuille flow with the variation of ρ r 1 1 ρ r 4 three types of path trajectories are observed at r e t 1106 steady periodic oscillating and chaotic acknowledgement this

23053,in this paper considering the difficult maneuverability of the air cushion vehicle acv a driver assistance system das of acv including an intuitive human computer interface das monitor and das controller is developed for humans the human computer interface is easy to be understood and used for humans and as das monitor appropriate sensors installed at handles of rudders and propellers are used to monitor driver s operational changes for the design of das controller model knowledge neural network mknn method is first proposed in this paper to deal with the parameter uncertainty of acv s complex model then the mknn based controller is designed as the das controller the das with mknn based controller can assist drivers in better control operations according to their action instructions and numerical simulations are implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the developed das with mknn based controller keywords motion control air cushion vehicle uncertainty neural network adaptive control 1 introduction air cushion vehicle acv as shown in fig 1 has a flexible skirt system around its periphery to seal the cushion air yun and bliault 2000 it can be lifted up by a large enough air cushion force to get amphibious performance and run at a high speed thus acv has been the focus of many oceanic research works including the exploration of oceans transportation scientific and military missions and more fu et al 2017 2018 the acv has very little contact with the water surface and the low righting moments at small ranges of an acv hovering over water result in rolling pitching yawing drifting and surging motions all being significant yun and bliault 2000 a maneuvering hovercraft moves with an angle of drift and generates an asymmetric wave pattern leading to the appearance of two additional reactions the side force and yawing moment zilman 2006 if the drift angle exceeds the angle of drift which corresponds to the maximum of hydrodynamic forces the behavior of acv will be nonstable zilman 1993 and when the acv is turning roll motion always exists and increases with the increase of the turn rate and drift angle tao and chengjie 2012 for safety a higher operating requirement for drivers is needed in the high speed moving process to prevent dangers like stern kickoff plough in great heeling and etc fu et al 2018 zilman 1993 hua 2008 to lighten this burden the study about driving control of acv is meaningful however from a detailed review of the available literature about the driving control of acv sira ramirez 2002 zhao and pang 2010 morales et al 2015 rigatos and raffo 2015 shojaei 2015 only simple three degrees of freedom dof model were adopted and aerodynamic and hydrodynamic forces and moments acting on the body were not represented in their equations of motion it s worth noting that four dof model including roll motion is closer to the performance of the real ship than three dof model for the study of acv s motion control fu et al 2018 jun and huang 2007 any analysis of a marine vehicle must include the analysis of the structure of these forces and moments formally after years of efforts by researchers cohen et al 2001 dyachenko 1999 doctors 1997 doctors and sharma 1972 newman and poole 1962 okita et al 2001 sahin and hyman 2001 tuck and lazauskas 2001 tuck et al 2002 drags of acv can be computed by using essentially the same formulas but they are affected by unavoidable uncertainties in the problem parameters caused by the limitation of test the error of manual record the measurement error of instrument especially other unknown uncertainty like unknown disturbance zilman 2006 intelligent controller can learn the dynamics of the robots with uncertainty online and tune the parameters and structure of the controller according to the operating dynamics and conditions without requiring the mathematical model of the control plant lu et al 2018 such as fuzzy logic systems sanchez et al 2015 xia et al 2018 wang et al 2017 chen et al 2018 hwang et al 2014 lin et al 2018 and artificial neural networks xia and huo 2016 feng and wen 2015 liu et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 mu et al 2017 ni et al 2018 however the authors believe that the model knowledge obtained by researchers through research and summarization of mathematical models for many years is also valuable and meaningful the model knowledge that people have mastered over the years should not be abandoned by existing intelligent control method but be combined with them to get better performance hence model knowledge neural network mknn method which integrates useful acv s model knowledge into the structure of classical radial basis function neural network is first proposed in this paper and a mknn based controller is designed to deal with the parameter uncertainty moreover the traditional automatic driving systems are completely controlled by the controller during it is used and humans cannot intervene unless the automatic driving function is turned off however sometimes what humans expect is to assist them in their operations rather than giving up their right to operate so driver assistance system das of acv is designed for humans in this paper the das integrates automatic control and manual operation very well and can assist the drivers in operating when necessary the paper is organized as follows in section 2 four dof model of acv is established das including das interface das monitor and das controller are described and designed in section 3 simulations are shown in section 4 finally the conclusion of this work is summarized in section 5 2 acv model description assumption 1 the motions of pitch and heave are not discussed the fan flow q of cushion fans is assumed to be constant assumption 2 the acv has two same air propellers and two same air rudders which are symmetrically mounted at the tail of the hull as shown in fig 2 and they can only be operated simultaneously not separately four dof model of acv are as follows 1 x y φ ψ cos ψ sin ψ cos φ 0 0 sin ψ cos ψ cos φ 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 cos φ u v p r 2 m u m v j x p j z r m v r m u r 0 0 f x d 2 f x r

assistance systems includes three parts das interface das monitor and das controller 3 1 das interface the human computer interface of the das is shown as fig 3 there are four parts in the interface including working mode monitor controller and motion display part a working mode part displays the current working mode enable or unable of the das part b monitor part displays the current driver s action on the handles of rudders and propellers part c controller part displays the current states of speed course and turn rate assistance subsystems and their values part d motion display part can intuitively show the motion state of acv 3 2 das monitor selecting the appropriate sensors to install on the handles as shown in fig 4 and monitor the driver s action on the handles hold or release these sensors can be pressure transducer temperature transducer or other suitable sensors speed assistance subsystem during the driver s operation relative sensors are working to monitor the action of driver on handles of propellers if the driver releases the handles it means the driver wishes to remain at the current speed subjectively in this case if the speed is still changing it indicates that there are other reasons for the change of speed then the speed assistance subsystem starts and helps the driver control the speed at the desired value turn rate assistance subsystem during the driver s operation relative sensors are working to monitor the action of driver on handle of rudders if the driver releases the handle it means the driver wishes to remain at the current turn rate subjectively in this case if the turn rate is still changing it indicates that there are other reasons for the change of turn rate then the turn rate assistance subsystem starts and helps the driver control the turn rate at the desired value course assistance subsystem relative sensors are working to monitor the action of driver on handle of rudders when rudder angle is zero if the driver releases the handle it means the driver wishes to remain at the current course angle subjectively in this case if the course angle is still changing it indicates that there are other reasons for the change of course angle then the course assistance subsystem starts and helps the driver control the course angle at the desired value 3 3 das controller 3 3 1 speed and turn rate controller we define

of the speed and course assistance subsystems of the das by comparing situation 1 with situation 2 and 3 in case 1 verify the effectiveness of the speed and turn rate assistance subsystems of the das by comparing situation 1 with situation 2 and 3 in case 2 verify the superiority of the das with mknn based controller in situation 3 by comparing the control performance of das with ordinary controller in situation 2 in both two cases 4 2 scheme the first case is about the verification of the speed and course assistance subsystems the other is about the speed and turn rate assistance subsystems in each case a comparison of three different situations is conducted situation 1 no das that is das is not used the acv is operated only by driver s manual operation force and moment of

controller for both situation 2 and 3 when t 200 s τ f x and τ m z are given by 32 then driver releases handles and the das starts working from t 200 s τ f x and τ m z are generated by the corresponding das controller in all situations the time varying disturbances wang et al 2018 du et al 2016 as shown in 36 are taken as unknown disturbance 36 d t j ψ φ t b where j ψ φ cos ψ sin ψ cos

vector of zero mean gaussian white noises and a r 4 4 is a diagonal matrix scaling the amplitude of w 4 3 parameters the main particulars of acv are shown in table 1 the other input parameters and coefficients are shown in table 2 and the following function n w m u is selected to represent the relationship between c w m and u according to the corresponding relationship curve in third chapter of yun and bliault 2000 n w m u 0 3 e u 10 2 2 8 2 0 2 choose b 0 1 10 4 n 1 10 4 n 1 10 4 n m 1 10 4 n m t t d i a g 10 3 10 3 10 3 10 3 and a d i a g 5000 5000 5000 5000 the initial values of acv are x

rate are the values at t 200 s for situations 2 and 3 controllers used in different situations are shown in table 3 among them figs 6 10 show the motion states of acv in case 1 and 2 the input force and moment are shown by figs 11 and 12 the generated disturbance of situation 3 in case 1 and case 2 are shown by fig 13 it is worth noting that the disturbance of situation 1 and 2 are slight different from situation 3 due to the randomness of zero mean gaussian white noises for the sake of brevity they are not shown here and self learning parameters are shown in fig 14 it is obvious from figs 6 8 that although the force and moment of actuators of situation 1 in both two cases are remain unchanged but the speed course angle and turn rate of situation 1 are not stable because of the disturbance and for situation 2 in both cases the das with ordinary controller starts working at t 200 s then the stability of the speed is improved from t 200 s as shown in fig 6 by the speed controller of das similarly the stability of turn rate is improved by the turn rate controller in fig 8 and the course keeping is realized from fig 7 however it is obvious that the control performance of situation 2 is unsatisfied and large errors are existed the reason is the das controller used in situation 2 of both two cases is designed based on a parameter uncertainty model in situation 3 of two cases the das with mknn based controller are adopted it is undeniable from the comparisons of figs 6 8 that the das with mknn based controller is better than das with ordinary controller in situation 2 it can help drivers control the states stay on the values from t 200 s with small enough errors although the unknown disturbance and parameter uncertainty are existed 5 conclusion in this paper a das including an intuitive human computer interface das monitor and das controller is developed for acv the human computer interface is easy to be understood and used for humans and das monitor can monitor driver s operational changes for the das controller part mknn method is first proposed in this paper to deal with parameter uncertainty then the mknn based controller is designed

23053,in this paper considering the difficult maneuverability of the air cushion vehicle acv a driver assistance system das of acv including an intuitive human computer interface das monitor and das controller is developed for humans the human computer interface is easy to be understood and used for humans and as das monitor appropriate sensors installed at handles of rudders and propellers are used to monitor driver s operational changes for the design of das controller model knowledge neural network mknn method is first proposed in this paper to deal with the parameter uncertainty of acv s complex model then the mknn based controller is designed as the das controller the das with mknn based controller can assist drivers in better control operations according to their action instructions and numerical simulations are implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the developed das with mknn based controller keywords motion control air cushion vehicle uncertainty neural network adaptive control 1 introduction air cushion vehicle acv as shown in fig 1 has a flexible skirt system around its periphery to seal the cushion air yun and bliault 2000 it can be lifted up by a large enough air cushion force to get amphibious performance and run at a high speed thus acv has been the focus of many oceanic research works including the exploration of oceans transportation scientific and military missions and more fu et al 2017 2018 the acv has very little contact with the water surface and the low righting moments at small ranges of an acv hovering over water result in rolling pitching yawing drifting and surging motions all being significant yun and bliault 2000 a maneuvering hovercraft moves with an angle of drift and generates an asymmetric wave pattern leading to the appearance of two additional reactions the side force and yawing moment zilman 2006 if the drift angle exceeds the angle of drift which corresponds to the maximum of hydrodynamic forces the behavior of acv will be nonstable zilman 1993 and when the acv is turning roll motion always exists and increases with the increase of the turn rate and drift angle tao and chengjie 2012 for safety a higher operating requirement for drivers is needed in the high speed moving process to prevent dangers like stern kickoff plough in great heeling and etc fu et al 2018 zilman 1993 hua 2008 to lighten this burden the study about driving control of acv is meaningful however from a detailed review of the available literature about the driving control of acv sira ramirez 2002 zhao and pang 2010 morales et al 2015 rigatos and raffo 2015 shojaei 2015 only simple three degrees of freedom dof model were adopted and aerodynamic and hydrodynamic forces and moments acting on the body were not represented in their equations of motion it s worth noting that four dof model including roll motion is closer to the performance of the real ship than three dof model for the study of acv s motion control fu et al 2018 jun and huang 2007 any analysis of a marine vehicle must include the analysis of the structure of these forces and moments formally after years of efforts by researchers cohen et al 2001 dyachenko 1999 doctors 1997 doctors and sharma 1972 newman and poole 1962 okita et al 2001 sahin and hyman 2001 tuck and lazauskas 2001 tuck et al 2002 drags of acv can be computed by using essentially the same formulas but they are affected by unavoidable uncertainties in the problem parameters caused by the limitation of test the error of manual record the measurement error of instrument especially other unknown uncertainty like unknown disturbance zilman 2006 intelligent controller can learn the dynamics of the robots with uncertainty online and tune the parameters and structure of the controller according to the operating dynamics and conditions without requiring the mathematical model of the control plant lu et al 2018 such as fuzzy logic systems sanchez et al 2015 xia et al 2018 wang et al 2017 chen et al 2018 hwang et al 2014 lin et al 2018 and artificial neural networks xia and huo 2016 feng and wen 2015 liu et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 mu et al 2017 ni et al 2018 however the authors believe that the model knowledge obtained by researchers through research and summarization of mathematical models for many years is also valuable and meaningful the model knowledge that people have mastered over the years should not be abandoned by existing intelligent control method but be combined with them to get better performance hence model knowledge neural network mknn method which integrates useful acv s model knowledge into the structure of classical radial basis function neural network is first proposed in this paper and a mknn based controller is designed to deal with the parameter uncertainty moreover the traditional automatic driving systems are completely controlled by the controller during it is used and humans cannot intervene unless the automatic driving function is turned off however sometimes what humans expect is to assist them in their operations rather than giving up their right to operate so driver assistance system das of acv is designed for humans in this paper the das integrates automatic control and manual operation very well and can assist the drivers in operating when necessary the paper is organized as follows in section 2 four dof model of acv is established das including das interface das monitor and das controller are described and designed in section 3 simulations are shown in section 4 finally the conclusion of this work is summarized in section 5 2 acv model description assumption 1 the motions of pitch and heave are not discussed the fan flow q of cushion fans is assumed to be constant assumption 2 the acv has two same air propellers and two same air rudders which are symmetrically mounted at the tail of the hull as shown in fig 2 and they can only be operated simultaneously not separately four dof model of acv are as follows 1 x y φ ψ cos ψ sin ψ cos φ 0 0 sin ψ cos ψ cos φ 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 cos φ u v p r 2 m u m v j x p j z r m v r m u r 0 0 f x d 2 f x r

assistance systems includes three parts das interface das monitor and das controller 3 1 das interface the human computer interface of the das is shown as fig 3 there are four parts in the interface including working mode monitor controller and motion display part a working mode part displays the current working mode enable or unable of the das part b monitor part displays the current driver s action on the handles of rudders and propellers part c controller part displays the current states of speed course and turn rate assistance subsystems and their values part d motion display part can intuitively show the motion state of acv 3 2 das monitor selecting the appropriate sensors to install on the handles as shown in fig 4 and monitor the driver s action on the handles hold or release these sensors can be pressure transducer temperature transducer or other suitable sensors speed assistance subsystem during the driver s operation relative sensors are working to monitor the action of driver on handles of propellers if the driver releases the handles it means the driver wishes to remain at the current speed subjectively in this case if the speed is still changing it indicates that there are other reasons for the change of speed then the speed assistance subsystem starts and helps the driver control the speed at the desired value turn rate assistance subsystem during the driver s operation relative sensors are working to monitor the action of driver on handle of rudders if the driver releases the handle it means the driver wishes to remain at the current turn rate subjectively in this case if the turn rate is still changing it indicates that there are other reasons for the change of turn rate then the turn rate assistance subsystem starts and helps the driver control the turn rate at the desired value course assistance subsystem relative sensors are working to monitor the action of driver on handle of rudders when rudder angle is zero if the driver releases the handle it means the driver wishes to remain at the current course angle subjectively in this case if the course angle is still changing it indicates that there are other reasons for the change of course angle then the course assistance subsystem starts and helps the driver control the course angle at the desired value 3 3 das controller 3 3 1 speed and turn rate controller we define

of the speed and course assistance subsystems of the das by comparing situation 1 with situation 2 and 3 in case 1 verify the effectiveness of the speed and turn rate assistance subsystems of the das by comparing situation 1 with situation 2 and 3 in case 2 verify the superiority of the das with mknn based controller in situation 3 by comparing the control performance of das with ordinary controller in situation 2 in both two cases 4 2 scheme the first case is about the verification of the speed and course assistance subsystems the other is about the speed and turn rate assistance

controller for both situation 2 and 3 when t 200 s τ f x and τ m z are given by 32 then driver releases handles and the das starts working from t 200 s τ f x and τ m z are generated by the corresponding das controller in all situations the time varying disturbances wang et al 2018 du et al 2016 as shown in 36 are taken as unknown disturbance 36 d t j ψ φ t b where j ψ φ cos ψ sin ψ cos

coefficients are shown in table 2 and the following function n w m u is selected to represent the relationship between c w m and u according to the corresponding relationship curve in third chapter of yun and bliault 2000 n w m u 0 3 e u 10 2 2 8 2 0 2 choose b 0 1 10 4 n 1 10 4 n 1 10 4 n m 1 10 4 n m t t d i a g 10 3 10 3 10 3 10 3 and a d i a g 5000 5000 5000 5000 the initial values of acv are x

rate are the values at t 200 s for situations 2 and 3 controllers used in different situations are shown in table 3 among them figs 6 10 show the motion states of acv in case 1 and 2 the input force and moment are shown by figs 11 and 12 the generated disturbance of situation 3 in case 1 and case 2 are shown by fig 13 it is worth noting that the disturbance of situation 1 and 2 are slight different from situation 3 due to the randomness of zero mean gaussian white noises for the sake of brevity they are not shown here and self learning parameters are shown in fig 14 it is obvious from figs 6 8 that although the force and moment of actuators of situation 1 in both two cases are remain unchanged but the speed course angle and turn rate of situation 1 are not stable because of the disturbance and for situation 2 in both cases the das with ordinary controller starts working at t 200 s then the stability of the speed is improved from t 200 s as shown in fig 6 by the speed controller of das similarly the stability of turn rate is improved by the turn rate controller in fig 8 and the course keeping is realized from fig 7 however it is obvious that the control performance of situation 2 is unsatisfied and large errors are existed the reason is the das controller used in situation 2 of both two cases is designed based on a parameter uncertainty model in situation 3 of two cases the das with mknn based controller are adopted it is undeniable from the comparisons of figs 6 8 that the das with mknn based controller is better than das with ordinary controller in situation 2 it can help drivers control the states stay on the values from t 200 s with small enough errors although the unknown disturbance and parameter uncertainty are existed 5 conclusion in this paper a das including an intuitive human computer interface das monitor and das controller is developed for acv the human computer interface is easy to be understood and used for humans and das monitor can monitor driver s operational changes for the das controller part mknn method is first proposed in this paper to deal with parameter uncertainty then the mknn based controller is designed as the das controller the developed das can assist drivers in better control operations according to their action instructions the simulations indicate the effectiveness of the das moreover the

23054,eedi energy efficiency design indicator a mandatory regulation is closely related to many design parameters of ships hulls which were conventionally set to be constant however it is often the case that considerable parameter fluctuations occur during actual navigation so it is more reasonable to state the important parameters as uncertainty variables there are two primary types of uncertainty aleatory uncertainty which exists objectively in architecture and its operating environment and epistemic uncertainty deriving from the ignorance or incomplete information of designers accordingly a mixed aleatory epistemic uncertainty analysis and optimization method based on probability and evidence theory is introduced in this research furthermore transformation methods of uncertainty targets and constraints to certainty targets are employed to conduct a mixed uncertainty optimization upon comparison with optimization design of certainty and traditional uncertainty mixed aleatory epistemic uncertainty optimization shows excellent adaptability and reliability in minimum eedi ship hull lines designs keywords eedi mixed uncertainty optimization ship hull lines epistemic uncertainty 1 introduction energy efficiency design indicator eedi a mandatory regulation for all newly built ships since january 1 2013 imo mepc 2014 to expresses the co2 discharge generated by ship transportation of each tonnage unit quantity of shipments and has already become a significant index for naval architecture energy efficiency compulsory execution of eedi accelerates the process of energy saving and emission reduction in naval architecture and higher requirements are proposed for the development of green ships eedi is closely related to ship hull lines which greatly affect sailing performance and other features it is well recognized that numbers of internal or external uncertainty parameters have an effect on eedi such as ship resistance service speed some turbine factors and so on however relevant studies are mostly carried out based on a simplified environment thus some important environmental parameters were usually set as deterministic or constant in the design process zou 2014 cheng et al 2014 although the perturbation uncertainty magnitudes are relatively small in most cases their continuous calculation and coupling effects with other parameters would cause the system response to have large deviations in the outcomes neglecting the influence of uncertainty would lead to a low robustness result with specific limitations in practical application there are two kinds of uncertainty in engineering designs aleatory uncertainty which exists objectively in architecture and its operating environment and epistemic uncertainty which derives from the ignorance or incomplete information of designers the former is uncertainty that is usually expressed in the form of interval or probability as the latter is unknown without any available probability distribution it can be only described by several assignment schemes of the possible values as is shown in fig 1 considering the two uncertainty factors comprehensively some theoretical literature research studies were carried out in recent years system reliability threshold limitation was analyzed by probability theory and fuzzy set du and choi 2008 adduri and penmetsa 2009 zhang et al 2010 unified uncertainty analysis method was proposed by means of probability analysis via the first order reliability analysis form method and interval analysis based on evidence theory du 2008 and mixed uncertainty quantification with collocation based stochastic expansions and optimization based interval estimation was researched as well eldred et al 2011 aiming at the optimization problem under mixed uncertainty reliability based optimization methods under both aleatory and epistemic uncertainties were studied yao et al 2013 focusing on how to transform the reliability based optimization problem into its quasi equivalent deterministic formulation according to the information obtained in the uncertainty analysis mixed aleatory epistemic uncertainty quantification was made within the context of hypersonic flows for application lockwood et al 2012 both uncertainties were well taken into account in the above studies but appropriate algorithms still needed to be researched for the specific engineering applications also recently uncertainty analysis and optimization was gradually taken seriously in the naval architecture field principal dimensions of container ships were optimized by robust design rd and robust optimization design rod diez and peri 2010 afterward rod was introduced in the ship hull simulation based design sbd system and principal dimensions or hull forms were optimized with the influence of speed disturbance and wave response diez et al 2014 leotardi et al 2015 xi et al 2015 a review of methods on the uncertainties in the estimation of wave loads was made and ship responses during operation were also reviewed in a later case reliability assessment methods were used to account for the variation of ship and environmental parameters papanikolaou et al 2014 the common characteristic of the above studies was as follows aleatory uncertainty parameters were researched but epistemic uncertainties caused by incomplete information of particular parameters were ignored and to some extent one might say that uncertainty and unknown were not distinguished clearly thus exacerbating the unreliability of the results because the interval analysis and fuzzy theory are the simplifications of evidence theory under certain conditions mixed aleatory epistemic uncertainty analysis and optimization methods based on probability and evidence theory are the clear focus of this study the purpose of this study is to provide guidance for designers on hull form optimization with mixed uncertainty parameters first the formula and parameters of eedi with the numerical method for calculating resistance are described and the minimum eedi optimization model is established next aleatory epistemic uncertainty analysis is proposed pointing at the optimization model finally a suitable mixed uncertainty optimization method is used to obtain the optimal result and the feasibility and superiority of the novel approach are verified 2 optimization model for minimum eedi 2 1 eedi for calculation and analysis eedi can be expressed by the ratio of co2 emissions and quantity of shipments and is related to the

of its high precision and consideration of fluid motion in this study reynolds average n s formula rans are selected in the cfd solver and k ε viscous model are used for the multiphase calculation because of the long iterative process of cfd calculation approximate model is necessary which is a typical way in the ship simulation based design sbd kandasamy et al 2013 process back propagation neural network bpnn is a kind of multilayer feed forward network with error back propagation algorithm li and liu 2015 because of its excellent ability to approximate nonlinear function bpnn becomes one of typical approximation technologies and is adopted here to establish the approximate model of r t when training neural networks a large number of experimental design points sample points should be distributed in the design space the accuracy of neural network is directly affected by the number of and the distribution of sample points meanwhile too much sample points cost a high computational cost to compromise this contradiction and to ensure the uniformity of sample distribution uniform design method is employed here uniform design table of 11 factors and 16 levels u 16 16 11 is used and 16 sets of experimental program are generated in order to scatter the sample points evenly 50 sub schemes are randomly generated in the range of input variables set by each experimental program therefore a total of 800 schemes were generated the parameters of bp neural network are chosen as layer number is 3 and the number of neurons in the input layer the middle layer and the output layer are all 11 6 1 convergence threshold is 1 10 6 adaptive learning rate method is used as the training method here with an additional momentum factor which improves speed and ensures that the network does not fall into local minima 2 3 optimization model this study takes a large cargo ship as the example design variables are identified by principal dimensions such as waterline length l waterline width b and the modification of the hull shape which can be represented by the original data points multiplied hull modification functions are as shown in eqs 5 and 6 5 y f x z y f x z ω x z y a x z y a x z ω x z 6 ω x z 1 m n a m n sin π x x 0 x max x 0 m 2 sin π z 0 z z 0 t n 2 where y f a x z represents forward or after half of the hull points after changed both in the mid ship section of the interface ω x z is modification function of hull form a m n is control factor for hull shape in this research m n 1 2 3 in order to ensure that the internal space of hull is not significantly reduced and the travelling performance maintains acceptable changing of molded volume and cruising resistance is taking as constraint condition 7 0 r t r t 0 where and 0 are optimal and initial hull form s molded volume which can be calculated via simpson method by the hull points r t 0 is initial hull form s resistance constraint condition is assumed as a form of penalty function then the minimum eedi

include aleatory uncertainty vector x and epistemic uncertainty vector z due to the combined influence of mixed uncertainty actual exact probability of response value of f x z cannot be obtained thus evidence theory is used here and the belief and plausibility are adopted for lower and upper bounds of probability description a finite set of possible values of epistemic uncertainty vector z is assuming as ω each element in the power set 2 ω corresponds to one basic probability assignment bpa bpa function is denoted by m 2 ω 0 1 and meets 9 a 2 ω m a 0 m ϕ 0 a 2 ω m a 1 where m a is valid only for proposition a but not for the sub propositions element in the power set 2 ω whose bpa is greater than 0 is called focal element according to the evidence theory uncertainty distribution of f x z could be described by cumulative belief function cbf and cumulative plausibility function cpf defined as 10 c b f a b e l f a c p f a p l f a where a is limit condition value and failure region is denoted by d z f z a then the failure belief bel and plausibility pl can be calculated by reliability analysis distribution function of epistemic uncertainty vector z includes n c focal elements be indicated as c k 1 k n c in order to get the failure belief and plausibility aleatory uncertainty vector x is fixed as x then failure belief and failure plausibility at the failure region d bel d and pl d can be obtained by 11 b e l d k 1 n c m c k b e l k d p l d k 1 n c m c k p l k d where bel k d and pl k d are sub failure belief and sub failure plausibility for focal element c k and are described as 12 b e l k d pr x z c k f x z a pr f max x z a z c k p l k d pr x z c k f x z a pr f min x z a z c k therefore sub failure belief and sub failure plausibility of each focal element become the key factor of the failure belief and plausibility calculation first order reliability analysis method form was lead into this kind of unified uncertainty analysis uua problem and the form uua

variables x in the original space x with the transformation relationship t x σ after that limit state function is transformed to f t 1 σ z g σ z a there are two nesting problems need handling in eq 14 searching the maximum point at exterior layer and calculating the maximum response value of epistemic uncertainty vector at internal layer pointing at this framework improved hasofer lind rackwitz fiessler ihrlf algorithm is adopted by form uua ihrlf to obtain the renewal optimum point du 2008 but great error may arise because of the poor convergence performance which probably reach a local optimum or with no convergence at all sequential quadratic programming sqp is used as the optimizer in form uua sqp algorithm peiling 1991 that makes the optimization calculation more effective however with high computational complexity due to the two double level nesting problems of each focal element in the mixed uncertainty analysis as a modification form based on single level optimization form uua slo chen et al 2013 transfers the double layer nesting problem to single layer optimization as the following optimization model 15 f i n d σ z min σ s t g σ z a z c k f o r 1 i n

element c k n z is number of focal elements 3 2 uncertainty analysis of eedi a large cargo ship is taken as the example in this study for the purpose of designing a reasonable project input ranges are usually set empirically which are obtained according to the statistics of conventional ship types initial input ranges setting of this study is shown in table 2 in order to analyze the influence of variable changing on output namely the eedi it s necessary to conduct sensitivity analysis latin hypercube lh is used here benefited from the total freedom in selecting number of designs to run after 1200 runs inputs effect degree on the output is obtained by the means of pareto contribution as shown in fig 2 as is shown in fig 2 in addition to a mn other inputs all have great impacts on eedi in order to reduce the computational complexity it s necessary to ignore the uncertainty of unimportant factors for the following calculation so the hull control factors a mn are kept fixed also judging by experience the cruising speed and draft are usually under normal distribution in the course of navigation therefore the aleatory uncertainty variables and their distribution are as in table 3 epistemic uncertainty variables reflect the lack of knowledge for some particular domain focusing on eedi as eq 3 carbon conversion coefficient c f and propulsion coefficient pc are directly related to the internal operation condition of turbine engine when navigation epistemic uncertainty would exist all through the voyage epistemic uncertainty variables therefore are set as in table 4 because of the complex data model and huge calculation cost there are other important uncertainties during ship operation in unpredictable marine environment that are not considered in the study such as the influence of marine fouling and of added resistance in waves these factors can also be fit in the proposed approach by accurately analyzing the composition and probability distribution information after confirming the bpas of possible intervals the epistemic uncertainty information can be taken into account similarly as c f and pc in table 4 the failure belief and failure plausibility of constraints as shown in eq 7 are analyzed under condition in tables 3 and 4 to do the horizontally performance research comparison of four methods mentioned above form uua ihrlf form uua sqp form uua slo and monte carlo simulation mcs is made sampling method for mcs is 104 sample points are drawn from the random variable space and then 2500 epistemic uncertainty samples of each sample point are drawn from the focal elements space c k thus the total number of samples is 104 2500 n c where n c is the total number of epistemic uncertainty variable focal elements in joint distribution analysis result is shown in table 5 results of the four methods as is shown in table 5 are very close and reasonable and can prove the feasibility and computational efficiency of the form uuas as can be noticed disparity of belief and plausibility of case 2 is smaller than case 1 detail description of epistemic uncertainty therefore can improve the accuracy of system response function response value cbf and cpf curves of two cases 1 and 2 are shown in fig 3 bounds of cumulative probability distribution can be reflected by cbf and cpf curves the greater the distance between two curves the more difficult to determine the real probability distribution otherwise it s more accurate to describe the uncertainty distribution of response value as is shown in fig 3 difference between results of the four methods a b c and d is very small distance of case 2 is smaller than of case 1 that is because epistemic uncertainty variables of case 2 is more detailed than of case 1 thus the uncertainty distribution description of case 2 is more accurate along with the continuous enrichment of epistemic uncertainty information the distance between cpf and cbf will continue to decrease and tend to 0 until they converge to the true probability distribution curve 4 mixed uncertainty optimization 4 1 algorithms taking aleatory uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty into consideration jointly mixed uncertainty optimization can be described as 16 f i n d μ x min f s t p l f x p z f p f o b j p l g x p z c p f c o n x l μ x x u where x is design variable with bounds x l and x u while p and z denote aleatory uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty respectively as is required in eq 16 plausibility of objective function f x p z greater than f should be no larger than p f obj while plausibility of constraint function g x p z smaller than c should be no larger than p f con there would be some difficulties if the traditional uncertainty optimization method being used to eq 16 firstly complex mixed uncertainty analysis at inner layer brings huge computational cost secondly the optimization goal is not explicitly expressed but is the variables which satisfy the cumulative plausibility distribution thereby the computational burden would further increase to solve the aforementioned problems sequential optimization and mixed uncertainty analysis method somua was proposed yao 2011 which decomposed the traditional method into two sub problems deterministic optimization and mixed uncertainty analysis firstly in terms of the distribution characteristics uncertainty problem is transformed into equivalent deterministic optimization approximately and a closest optimal result to the real optimal solution is obtained secondly uncertainty analysis of the deterministic optimal result is conducted in which the description update of the next deterministic optimization step can be established and a more precisely optimal result from the deterministic optimization is finally obtained 4 1 1 uncertainty constraint transformation transformation method of uncertainty constraint conditions is described as follows current cycle step is denoted as i deterministic optimal point at current cycle step is μ x i and constraint failure region is d c o n g x p z c both the constraint failure plausibility p l i d c o n and failure sub plausibility p l k i d c o n can be calculated by uncertainty analysis the constraint failure plausibility of next cycle step p l i 1 d c o n could achieve the desired goal as long as 17 p l i 1 d c o n p l k i d c o n p l i d c o n p f c o n where p f con is the anticipated requirement sub failure plausibility of focal element k is as 18 p l k i 1 d c o n pr x p g min x p z c z c k pr g x p z c z j x p arg min z c k g x p z apparently z is not an independent variable but a factor from c k that could minimize the constraint function g after substituting j x p g x p z becomes to g j x p denoting b k c o n i 1 p l k i d c o n p l i d c o n p f c o n then quantile g j k c o n b i 1 x p is described as 19 pr g j x p g j k c o n b i 1 x p b k c o n i 1 thus eq 17 equivalents to 20 g j k c o n b i 1 x p c value of quantile g j k c o n b i 1 x p can be obtained by probability method as performance measure approach pma youn et al 2003 by solving the following optimization problem 21 f i n d u u x u p min g j u g u z z arg min z c k g u z s t u φ 1 b k c o n i 1 where u u x u p is random design variable and random system parameter after transferring to standard normal space and g u z is the corresponding description of g x p z the optimal point of eq 21 is named as the maximum possible inverse point and after transferring to original probability space it becomes to x k i m p p c o n i 1 p k i m p p c o n i 1 z k i m p p c o n i 1 then the quantile g j k c o n b i 1 x p can be estimated by g x k i m p p c o n i 1 p k i m p p c o n i 1 z k i m p p c o n i 1 to avoid huge computational costs at the i 1 step in deterministic optimization distance from variable expectation μ x i 1 to the two corresponding maximum possible inverse points x k i m m p c o n i 1 and x k i m m p c o n i are assumed the same which is denoted as s k c o n i 1 μ x i x k i m m p c o n i then maximum possible inverse point of μ x i 1 can be estimated by 22 x k i m p p c o n i 1 p k i m p p c o n i 1 z k i m p p c o n i 1 μ x i 1 s k c o n i 1 p k i m p p c o n i z k i m p p c o n i upon substitution eq 22 to eq 20 the constraint requirement of sub failure plausibility of focal element k becomes to 23 g μ x i 1 s k c o n i 1 p k i m p p c o n i z k i m p p c o n i c it can be understood from eq 23 that in the design space original constraint function translates the distance of vector s k c o n i 1 then the maximum possible inverse points of any point at constraint function boundary are in the feasible region of the original constraint function which is illustrated in fig 4 as is stated above by translating original uncertainty constraints to n c deterministic constraints imposed to each focal element as shown in eq 23 the reliability requirement of original constraints could be greatly meet 4 1 2 uncertainty target transformation transformation method of uncertainty target is described as follows current cycle step is denoted as i deterministic optimal point at current cycle step is μ x i optimization target is f i and target failure region is d o b j f x p z f i target failure plausibility is p l i d o b j and failure sub plausibility is p l k i d o b j target failure plausibility can achieve the desired goal as long as target failure sub plausibility of next cycle step meets 24 p l k i 1 d o b j p l k i d o b j p l i d o b j p f o b j where p f obj is the anticipated failure requirement for each focal element c k 1 k n c the sub plausibility target of μ x i is b k o b j i 1 whose maximum possible inverse point is x k i m p p o b j i p k i m p p o b j i z k i m p p o b j i then eq 24 can be transferred to 25 f μ x i 1 s k o b j i 1 p k i m p p o b j i z k i m p p o b j i f where s k o b j i 1 μ x i x k i m m p o b j i then the uncertainty optimization target is transferred to 26 min f s t f μ x i 1 s k o b j i 1 p k i m p p o b j i z k i m p p o b j i f 1 k n c which is equivalence as 27 min f max 1 k n c f μ x i 1 s k o b j i 1 p k i m p p o b j i z k i m p p o b j i 4 2 mixed uncertainty optimization of eedi based on the above transformation methods of constraint and target the optimization model for minimum expectation of eedi is established here that considers both the aleatory uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty as in table 6 in the 1st loop uncertainty constraint and target are transformed to the certainty ones then the initial result of certainty optimization is obtained after that updates of certainty optimization are conducted repeatedly until the target failure plausibility and constraint failure plausibility are all reduced to the acceptable level namely reaching the convergence the historical curve of this mixed uncertainty optimization is shown in fig 5 as shown in fig 5 convergence is reached after 15 loops in the 2nd and 3rd loop failure plausibility of target and constraint diminish rapidly then rise slowly until reaching the optimal in the next 10 loops to illustrate the proposed mixed uncertainty optimization method the optimization problem is also solved by traditional uncertainty and certainty optimization methods in the traditional uncertainty optimization epistemic uncertainty variables in table 6 are set to normal distribution whose expectation is the middle value and standard deviation is 1 of expectation in the certainty optimization all the uncertainty parameters are set to constant at the middle value or expectation the results of multiple methods are shown in table 7 as shown in table 7 all of the three optimization types can get better results of eedi but small differences exist eedi of mixed uncertainty is slightly worse than the certainty s and traditional uncertainty s and this phenomenon is also applicable to the constraints this is because the mixed uncertainty considers the epistemic uncertainty which has more inaccurate unknown information thus mixed uncertainty optimization method has the fine availability when dealing with design problems with unknown information and the result of which has stronger immunity for the unknown effect of uncertain factors 5 conclusions pointing at ship hull form optimization design a minimum eedi optimization model is established with the design space comprising principal dimensions and ship form coefficients the influences of two types of uncertainty aleatory and epistemic are considered in this study analysis and optimization of mixed uncertainty are conducted respectively the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the more detailed the epistemic uncertainty variables the more accurate the uncertainty distribution description but this requires longer computing times 2 a mixed uncertainty optimization method can obtain the optimum result with acceptable constraints and failure plausibility thus this method is effective 3 under the same conditions the result of mixed uncertainty optimization is slightly worse than the results of certainty and of traditional uncertainty but the former considers the unknown information so it can better reflect reality and thus be superior 4 compared with traditional methods somua can reduce the computation complexity but its computation cost is still high with the increased number of focal elements the complexity of transformed deterministic optimization problems will increase greatly so the efficiency of somua will decrease thus further studies can be carried out to research the transformation method of uncertainty optimization targets and constraints with a large number of focal elements acknowledgement this work is supported by the national natural science foundation of

23054,eedi energy efficiency design indicator a mandatory regulation is closely related to many design parameters of ships hulls which were conventionally set to be constant however it is often the case that considerable parameter fluctuations occur during actual navigation so it is more reasonable to state the important parameters as uncertainty variables there are two primary types of uncertainty aleatory uncertainty which exists objectively in architecture and its operating environment and epistemic uncertainty deriving from the ignorance or incomplete information of designers accordingly a mixed aleatory epistemic uncertainty analysis and optimization method based on probability and evidence theory is introduced in this research furthermore transformation methods of uncertainty targets and constraints to certainty targets are employed to conduct a mixed uncertainty optimization upon comparison with optimization design of certainty and traditional uncertainty mixed aleatory epistemic uncertainty optimization shows excellent adaptability and reliability in minimum eedi ship hull lines designs keywords eedi mixed uncertainty optimization ship hull lines epistemic uncertainty 1 introduction energy efficiency design indicator eedi a mandatory regulation for all newly built ships since january 1 2013 imo mepc 2014 to expresses the co2 discharge generated by ship transportation of each tonnage unit quantity of shipments and has already become a significant index for naval architecture energy efficiency compulsory execution of eedi accelerates the process of energy saving and emission reduction in naval architecture and higher requirements are proposed for the development of green ships eedi is closely related to ship hull lines which greatly affect sailing performance and other features it is well recognized that numbers of internal or external uncertainty parameters have an effect on eedi such as ship resistance service speed some turbine factors and so on however relevant studies are mostly carried out based on a simplified environment thus some important environmental parameters were usually set as deterministic or constant in the design process zou 2014 cheng et al 2014 although the perturbation uncertainty magnitudes are relatively small in most cases their continuous calculation and coupling effects with other parameters would cause the system response to have large deviations in the outcomes neglecting the influence of uncertainty would lead to a low robustness result with specific limitations in practical application there are two kinds of uncertainty in engineering designs aleatory uncertainty which exists objectively in architecture and its operating environment and epistemic uncertainty which derives from the ignorance or incomplete information of designers the former is uncertainty that is usually expressed in the form of interval or probability as the latter is unknown without any available probability distribution it can be only described by several assignment schemes of the possible values as is shown in fig 1 considering the two uncertainty factors comprehensively some theoretical literature research studies were carried out in recent years system reliability threshold limitation was analyzed by probability theory and fuzzy set du and choi 2008 adduri and penmetsa 2009 zhang et al 2010 unified uncertainty analysis method was proposed by means of probability analysis via the first order reliability analysis form method and interval analysis based on evidence theory du 2008 and mixed uncertainty quantification with collocation based stochastic expansions and optimization based interval estimation was researched as well eldred et al 2011 aiming at the optimization problem under mixed uncertainty reliability based optimization methods under both aleatory and epistemic uncertainties were studied yao et al 2013 focusing on how to transform the reliability based optimization problem into its quasi equivalent deterministic formulation according to the information obtained in the uncertainty analysis mixed aleatory epistemic uncertainty quantification was made within the context of hypersonic flows for application lockwood et al 2012 both uncertainties were well taken into account in the above studies but appropriate algorithms still needed to be researched for the specific engineering applications also recently uncertainty analysis and optimization was gradually taken seriously in the naval architecture field principal dimensions of container ships were optimized by robust design rd and robust optimization design rod diez and peri 2010 afterward rod was introduced in the ship hull simulation based design sbd system and principal dimensions or hull forms were optimized with the influence of speed disturbance and wave response diez et al 2014 leotardi et al 2015 xi et al 2015 a review of methods on the uncertainties in the estimation of wave loads was made and ship responses during operation were also reviewed in a later case reliability assessment methods were used to account for the variation of ship and environmental parameters papanikolaou et al 2014 the common characteristic of the above studies was as follows aleatory uncertainty parameters were researched but epistemic uncertainties caused by incomplete information of particular parameters were ignored and to some extent one might say that uncertainty and unknown were not distinguished clearly thus exacerbating the unreliability of the results because the interval analysis and fuzzy theory are the simplifications of evidence theory under certain conditions mixed aleatory epistemic uncertainty analysis and optimization methods based on probability and evidence theory are the clear focus of this study the purpose of this study is to provide guidance for designers on hull form optimization with mixed uncertainty parameters first the formula and parameters of eedi with the numerical method for calculating resistance are described and the minimum eedi optimization model is established next aleatory epistemic uncertainty analysis is proposed pointing at the optimization model finally a suitable mixed uncertainty optimization method is used to obtain the optimal result and the feasibility and superiority of the novel approach are verified 2 optimization model for minimum eedi 2 1 eedi for calculation and analysis eedi can be expressed by the ratio of co2 emissions and quantity of shipments and is related to the

denoted by d z f z a then the failure belief bel and plausibility pl can be calculated by reliability analysis distribution function of epistemic uncertainty vector z includes n c focal elements be indicated as c k 1 k n c in order to get the failure belief and plausibility aleatory uncertainty vector x is fixed as x then failure belief and failure plausibility at the failure region d bel d and pl d can be obtained by 11 b e l d k 1 n c m c k b e l k d p l d k 1 n c m c k p l k d where bel k d and pl k d are sub failure belief and sub failure plausibility for focal element c k and are described as 12 b e l k d pr x z c k f x z a pr f max x z a z c k p l k d pr x z c k f x z a pr f min x z a z c k therefore sub failure belief and sub failure plausibility of each focal element become the key factor of the failure belief and plausibility calculation first order reliability analysis method form was lead into this kind of unified uncertainty analysis uua problem and the form uua method was proposed du 2006 objective f x z is assumed as continuous function then eq 12 could be overwritten as 13 b e l k d pr x f max x z a z c k φ σ k b e l b e l k d 0 5 1 p l k d e l s e p l k d pr x f min x z a z c k φ σ k p l p l k d 0 5 1 b e l k d e l s e where σ k b e l and σ k p l are maximum possible points which are the optimal results of the following optimization model 14 o p t min

variables x in the original space x with the transformation relationship t x σ after that limit state function is transformed to f t 1 σ z g σ z a there are two nesting problems need handling in eq 14 searching the maximum point at exterior layer and calculating the maximum response value of epistemic uncertainty vector at internal layer pointing at this framework improved hasofer lind rackwitz fiessler ihrlf algorithm is adopted by form uua ihrlf to obtain the renewal optimum point du 2008 but great error may arise because of the poor convergence performance which probably reach a local optimum or with no convergence at all sequential quadratic programming sqp is used as the optimizer in form uua sqp algorithm peiling 1991 that makes the optimization calculation more effective however with high computational complexity due to the two double level nesting problems of each focal element in the mixed uncertainty analysis as a modification form based on single level optimization form uua slo chen et al 2013 transfers the double layer nesting problem to single layer optimization as the following optimization model 15 f i n d σ z min σ s t g σ z a z c k f o r 1 i n

element c k n z is number of focal elements 3 2 uncertainty analysis of eedi a large cargo ship is taken as the example in this study for the purpose of designing a reasonable project input ranges are usually set empirically which are obtained according to the statistics of conventional ship types initial input ranges setting of this study is shown in table 2 in order to analyze the influence of variable changing on output namely the eedi it s necessary to conduct sensitivity analysis latin hypercube lh is used here benefited from the total freedom in selecting number of designs to run after 1200 runs inputs effect degree on the output is obtained by the means of pareto contribution as shown in fig 2 as is shown in fig 2 in addition to a mn other inputs all have great impacts on eedi in order to reduce the computational complexity it s necessary to ignore the uncertainty of unimportant factors for the following calculation so the hull control factors a mn are kept fixed also judging by experience the cruising speed and draft are usually under normal distribution in the course of navigation therefore the aleatory uncertainty variables and their distribution are as in table 3 epistemic uncertainty variables reflect the lack of knowledge for some particular domain focusing on eedi as eq 3 carbon conversion coefficient c f and propulsion coefficient pc are directly related to the internal operation condition of turbine engine when navigation epistemic uncertainty would exist all through the voyage epistemic uncertainty variables therefore are set as in table 4 because of the complex data model and huge calculation cost there are other important uncertainties during ship operation in unpredictable marine environment that are not considered in the study such as the influence of marine fouling and of added resistance in waves these factors can also be fit in the proposed approach by accurately analyzing the composition and probability distribution information after confirming the bpas of possible intervals the epistemic uncertainty information can be taken into account similarly as c f and pc in table 4 the failure belief and failure plausibility of constraints as shown in eq 7 are analyzed under condition in tables 3 and 4 to do the horizontally performance research comparison of four methods mentioned above form uua ihrlf form uua sqp form uua slo and monte carlo simulation mcs is made sampling method for mcs is 104 sample points are drawn from the random variable space and then 2500 epistemic uncertainty samples of each sample point are drawn from the focal elements space c k thus the total number of samples is 104 2500 n c where n c is the total number of epistemic uncertainty variable focal elements in joint distribution analysis result is shown in table 5 results of the four methods as is shown in table 5 are very close and reasonable and can prove the feasibility and computational efficiency of the form uuas as can be noticed disparity of belief and plausibility of case 2 is smaller than case 1 detail description of epistemic uncertainty therefore can improve the accuracy of system response function response value cbf and cpf curves of two cases 1 and 2 are shown in fig 3 bounds of cumulative probability distribution can be reflected by cbf and cpf curves the greater the distance between two curves the more difficult to determine the real probability distribution otherwise it s more accurate to describe the uncertainty distribution of response value as is shown in fig 3 difference between results of the four methods a b c and d is very small distance of case 2 is smaller than of case 1 that is because epistemic uncertainty variables of case 2 is more detailed than of case 1 thus the uncertainty distribution description of case 2 is more accurate along with the continuous enrichment of epistemic uncertainty information the distance between cpf and cbf will continue to decrease and tend to 0 until they converge to the true probability distribution curve 4 mixed uncertainty optimization 4 1 algorithms taking aleatory uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty into consideration jointly mixed uncertainty optimization can be described as 16 f i n d μ x min f s t p l f x p z f p f o b j p l g x p z c p f c o n x l μ x x u where x is design variable with bounds x l and x u while p and z denote aleatory uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty respectively as is required in eq 16 plausibility of objective function f x p z greater than f should be no larger than p f obj while plausibility of constraint function g x p z smaller than c should be no larger than p f con there would be some difficulties if the traditional uncertainty optimization method being used to eq 16 firstly complex mixed uncertainty analysis at inner layer brings huge computational cost secondly the optimization goal is not explicitly expressed but is the variables which satisfy the cumulative plausibility distribution thereby the computational burden would further increase to solve the aforementioned problems sequential optimization and mixed uncertainty analysis method somua was proposed yao 2011 which decomposed the traditional method into two sub problems deterministic optimization and mixed uncertainty analysis firstly in terms of the distribution characteristics uncertainty problem is transformed into equivalent deterministic optimization approximately and a closest optimal result to the real optimal solution is obtained secondly uncertainty analysis of the deterministic optimal result is conducted in which the description update of the next deterministic optimization step can be established and a more precisely optimal result from the deterministic optimization is finally obtained 4 1 1 uncertainty constraint transformation transformation method of uncertainty constraint conditions is described as follows current cycle step is denoted as i deterministic optimal point at current cycle step is μ x i and constraint failure region is d c o n g x p z c both the constraint failure plausibility p l i d c o n and failure sub plausibility p l k i d c o n can be calculated by uncertainty analysis the constraint failure plausibility of next cycle step p l i 1 d c o n could achieve the desired goal as long as 17 p l i 1 d c o n p l k i d c o n p l i d c o n p f c o n where p f con is the anticipated requirement sub failure plausibility of focal element k is as 18 p l k i 1 d c o n pr x p g min x p z c z c k pr g x p z c z j x p arg min z c k g x p z apparently z is not an independent variable but a factor from c k that could minimize the constraint function g after substituting j x p g x p z becomes to g j x p denoting b k c o n i 1 p l k i d c o n p l i d c o n p f c o n then quantile g j k c o n b i 1 x p is described as 19 pr g j x p g j k c o n b i 1 x p b k c o n i 1 thus eq 17 equivalents to 20 g j k c o n b i 1 x p c value of quantile g j k c o n b i 1 x p can be obtained by probability method as performance measure approach pma youn et al 2003 by solving the following optimization problem 21 f i n d u u x u p min g j u g u z z arg min z c k g u z s t u φ 1 b k c o n i 1 where u u x u p is random design variable and random system parameter after transferring to standard normal space and g u z is the corresponding description of g x p z the optimal point of eq 21 is named as the maximum possible inverse point and after transferring to original probability space it becomes to x k i m p p c o n i 1 p k i m p p c o n i 1 z k i m p p c o n i 1 then the quantile g j k c o n b i 1 x p can be estimated by g x k i m p p c o n i 1 p k i m p p c o n i 1 z k i m p p c o n i 1 to avoid huge computational costs at the i 1 step in deterministic optimization distance from variable expectation μ x i 1 to the two corresponding maximum possible inverse points x k i m m p c o n i 1 and x k i m m p c o n i are assumed the same which is denoted as s k c o n i 1 μ x i x k i m m p c o n i then maximum possible inverse point of μ x i 1 can be estimated by 22 x k i m p p c o n i 1 p k i m p p c o n i 1 z k i m p p c o n i 1 μ x i 1 s k c o n i 1 p k i m p p c o n i z k i m p p c o n i upon substitution eq 22 to eq 20 the constraint requirement of sub failure plausibility of focal element k becomes to 23 g μ x i 1 s k c o n i 1 p k i m p p c o n i z k i m p p c o n i c it can be understood from eq 23 that in the design space original constraint function translates the distance of vector s k c o n i 1 then the maximum possible inverse points of any point at constraint function boundary are in the feasible region of the original constraint function which is illustrated in fig 4 as is stated above by translating original uncertainty constraints to n c deterministic constraints imposed to each focal element as shown in eq 23 the reliability requirement of original constraints could be greatly meet 4 1 2 uncertainty target transformation transformation method of uncertainty target is described as follows current cycle step is denoted as i deterministic optimal point at current cycle step is μ x i optimization target is f i and target failure region is d o b j f x p z f i target failure plausibility is p l i d o b j and failure sub plausibility is p l k i d o b j target failure plausibility can achieve the desired goal as long as target failure sub plausibility of next cycle step meets 24 p l k i 1 d o b j p l k i d o b j p l i d o b j p f o b j where p f obj is the anticipated failure requirement for each focal element c k 1 k n c the sub plausibility target of μ x i is b k o b j i 1 whose maximum possible inverse point is x k i m p p o b j i p k i m p p o b j i z k i m p p o b j i then eq 24 can be transferred to 25 f μ x i 1 s k o b j i 1 p k i m p p o b j i z k i m p p o b j i f where s k o b j i 1 μ x i x k i m m p o b j i then the uncertainty optimization target is transferred to 26 min f s t f μ x i 1 s k o b j i 1 p k i m p p o b j i z k i m p p o b j i f 1 k n c which is equivalence as 27 min f max 1 k n c f μ x i 1 s k o b j i 1 p k i m p p o b j i z k i m p p o b j i 4 2 mixed uncertainty optimization of eedi based on the above transformation methods of constraint and target the optimization model for minimum expectation of eedi is established here that considers both the aleatory uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty as in table 6 in the 1st loop uncertainty constraint and target are transformed to the certainty ones then the initial result of certainty optimization is obtained after that updates of certainty optimization are conducted repeatedly until the target failure plausibility and constraint failure plausibility are all reduced to the acceptable level namely reaching the convergence the historical curve of this mixed uncertainty optimization is shown in fig 5 as shown in fig 5 convergence is reached after 15 loops in the 2nd and 3rd loop failure plausibility of target and constraint diminish rapidly then rise slowly until reaching the optimal in the next 10 loops to illustrate the proposed mixed uncertainty optimization method the optimization problem is also solved by traditional uncertainty and certainty optimization methods in the traditional uncertainty optimization epistemic uncertainty variables in table 6 are set to normal distribution whose expectation is the middle value and standard deviation is 1 of expectation in the certainty optimization all the uncertainty parameters are set to constant at the middle value or expectation the results of multiple methods are shown in table 7 as shown in table 7 all of the three optimization types can get better results of eedi but small differences exist eedi of mixed uncertainty is slightly worse than the certainty s and traditional uncertainty s and this phenomenon is also applicable to the constraints this is because the mixed uncertainty considers the epistemic uncertainty which has more inaccurate unknown information thus mixed uncertainty optimization method has the fine availability when dealing with design problems with unknown information and the result of which has stronger immunity for the unknown effect of uncertain factors 5 conclusions pointing at ship hull form optimization design a minimum eedi optimization model is established with the design space comprising principal dimensions and ship form coefficients the influences of two types of uncertainty aleatory and epistemic are considered in this study analysis and optimization of mixed uncertainty are conducted respectively the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the more detailed the epistemic uncertainty variables the more accurate the uncertainty distribution description but this requires longer computing times 2 a mixed uncertainty optimization method can obtain the optimum result with acceptable constraints and failure plausibility thus this method is effective 3 under the same conditions the result of mixed uncertainty optimization is slightly worse than the results of certainty and of traditional uncertainty but the former considers the unknown information so it can better reflect reality and thus be superior 4 compared with traditional methods somua can reduce the computation complexity but its computation cost is still high with the increased number of focal elements the complexity of transformed deterministic optimization problems will increase greatly so the efficiency of somua will decrease thus further studies can be carried out to research the transformation method of uncertainty optimization targets and constraints with a large number of focal elements acknowledgement this work is supported by the national natural science foundation of
