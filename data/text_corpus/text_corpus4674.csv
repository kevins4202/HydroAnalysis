static loading and validated with experimental results for the numerical analysis a general nonlinear mathematical model of the laminated composite curved shell panel including the effect of the internal damage is derived with the help of two higher order kinematic theories and green lagrange nonlinear strain the desired governing equation is obtained by minimizing the energy expression and solved via nonlinear finite element steps the numerical responses are computed via a generic matlab code developed based on the present mathematical formulation the degree of accuracy of the current numerical model has been checked and the subsequent validation is established by comparing the present results with available published results in addition an experimental investigation has also been carried out for the comparison purpose via three point bend test on the laminated glass epoxy composite with artificial delamination lastly numbers of numerical examples are solved to demonstrate the implicit behavior of the currently developed higher order nonlinear model for the analysis of the pre damaged layered structure keywords nonlinear bending delaminated composite panel experimental validation mechanical load host 1 introduction since last few decades the application of layered composites material has been increased rapidly in the manufacturing the weight sensitive and high performance structures in civil construction marine aircraft aerospace and automobile industries due to their excellent property and ability to be tailored for particular applications gay and hoa 2007 most commonly the laminated composite structure does not have any reinforcement in the thickness direction which leads to the high inter laminar shear stress and subsequent separation of the consecutive layers the separation of the layer generally termed to be delamination or debonding may arise due to the several reasons and in several ways some of the common reasons are entrapment of air pockets or foreign particles incomplete curing material and geometric discontinuity during the manufacturing and eccentric and low velocity impact loading during service life sridharan 2008 the presence of internal debonding could affect the structural integrity and the structural performance significantly hence the thorough understanding and quantitative measurement of the influence of the debonding on the stiffness and structural responses of the laminated structure is very much essential in order to identify the necessary gaps of the earlier studies on the delaminated structure a comprehensive review of the previously published literature is discussed in the following lines and subsequent objective of the present article also framed accordingly the present review is mainly focused on the two major issues i e the solution techniques adopted for the desired structural responses and the mid plane kinematics used for the mathematical modeling purpose of the laminated delaminated structure in the early nineties the transverse deflection behavior of laminated composite curved shell panels single and doubly are investigated numerically by reddy and chandrashekhara 1985 using finite element fe model based on the extended sander s shell theory including the von karman type of geometrical nonlinear strain displacement relations similarly fe steps are further utilized to examine the nonlinear bending and the stress behavior of the laminated composites plate by barbero and reddy 1990 using the generalized laminated plate theory glpt in conjunction with von karman nonlinear strain the fe solutions of the nonlinear static and the transient responses of the laminated composite plate are reported by chang and huang 1991 based on the higher order mid plane theory and von karman geometrical nonlinearity also the nonlinear fe steps are employed to compute the bending strength of the doubly curved laminated composite as well as the sandwich shell panels by kant and kommineni 1992 1994 using the higher order kinematic theory and von karman strains the nonlinear static and dynamic fe solutions of the laminated composites plate are reported by ganapathi et al 1996 for the laminated structure using an eight noded quadrilateral element and von karman strain displacement relations further a new plate shell triangular element is developed by zhang and kim 2005 to compute the geometrical nonlinear deflection parameters of the laminated plate based on the first order mid plane kinematics later the first order shear deformation theory fost type of mid plane kinematics along with von karman geometrical nonlinear strains are utilized by baltacıoglu et al 2010 for the computation of the flexural strength of the orthotropic laminated structure via numerical methods the effect of combined pressure and thermal loading on the nonlinear flexural behavior of the laminated composite plate resting on an elastic foundation is analysed by shen 2000 the closed form solution of the fundamental frequency and flexural behavior of the sandwich shell panel is presented first time by biglari and jafari 2010 with the help of newly developed three layered higher order mixed theory gupta et al 2013 reported the fe solutions of the nonlinear flexural responses of the laminated composite plate with growing damage via the fost kinematics and von karman nonlinear strains likewise the static buckling flutter and dynamic responses of the functionally graded material fgm plate structure using the fe associated non uniform rational b spline method by valizadeh et al 2013 in the framework of the fost kinematics in contrast to the finite element method fem galerkin kriging in association with the meshfree approach also employed to compute the buckling and the flexural characteristic of the laminated composite plate by bui and nguyen 2013 the nonlinear fe solutions of the large deflection transverse bending characteristics of the fgm sandwich plate is computed using the refined plate theory and von karman nonlinearity by kaci et al 2013 further the four variable refined plate theory is developed first time to investigate the static responses of the fgm plate by benatta et al 2014 including the geometrical nonlinearity under the pressure loading similarly the fe technique has been implemented to examine the modal responses of thick and thin laminated structure by tornabene et al 2017 in the framework of the equivalent layerwise theory unlike the other available techniques the explicit dynamic relaxation method has been employed by alamatian and rezaeepazhand 2016 for the analysis of the nonlinear static characteristic of the laminated composite plate with variable cross sections malta and martin malta et al 2017 investigated numerically the effect of compressive load on the five layer flexible pipe using 3d nonlinear fe model now the articles reviewed in this section for the structure or the structural components with internal damage and solved using various numerical analytical technique including the large finite deformation effect the influence of the generation and the propagation of the transverse crack on the stiffness behavior of the angle ply laminated composites plate is reported by amara et al 2006 further the delaminated composite beam is analysed numerically by hicks et al 2003 using the energy method in association with the fe approach and compared with subsequent experimental results similarly the effect of delamination on the laminated tube and bar structures are computed using the simulation model by carneiro and savi vieira and savi 2000 wang and shenoi 2003 proposed a new modeling approach based on the linear curved beam theory including the fracture mechanics for the analysis of the delaminated composite curved beam likewise the dynamic characteristics of the laminated composite structure with delamination are modeled using the sub laminate approach by manoach et al 2016 the progressive failure analysis of the damaged layered composite structure with and without stiffener is presented by riccio et al 2016 2017a 2017b the system of exact kinematic condition sekc steps have been employed to evaluate the dynamic characteristics by szekrényes 2015 to study the effect of delamination through the width of the plate to main the kinematic continuity between the laminated and debonded composite further the updated version of sekc approach is introduced by szekrényes 2016 to examine the mechanical responses of delaminated composite plates using different mid plane kinematic first second and third order plate theories similarly the effect of the location and the length of the delamination are investigated by using new artificial immune system method bazardehi et al 2012 mohebbi et al 2013 the extensive review of the literature reveals that the various work has been attempted and reported on the linear nonlinear flexural strength of the laminated composite curve and flat panel is mainly using von karman type of geometrical nonlinear strains in the framework of fost and host higher order shear deformation theory mid plane kinematics in addition the damaged laminated composite panel model also focused on the edge debonding rather than internal debonding however both types of debonding phenomena in the laminate structures are equally important and cannot be avoided to the best of the authors knowledge no fe modeling has been discussed or reported yet in the open literature which accounts the large deformation in green lagrange type of nonlinear strain kinematics in association with host mid plane theory considering the effect of internal damage using the sub laminate concept hence in the present work authors aim to develop a generic type of fe model for the laminated curved shell panel with internal damage in the framework of two host kinematic model and green lagrange nonlinear strain to evaluate the nonlinear transverse deflection under the quasi static type of mechanical load the necessary consistency behavior and the validity of the said higher order models have been established by solving an adequate number of examples further to show the inevitability of the proposed host kinematics the results are compared with experimental results of laminated glass epoxy composite plate with and without damage lastly the importance and effect of the geometrical and material parameters along with various size position and location of delamination on the nonlinear transverse deflection under two different mechanical load are computed and conferred in details 2 theory and formulation 2 1 geometry of the proposed shell panel the physical model of the doubly curved laminated composite shell panel fig 1 assumed to be consist of n number of orthotropic layers of uniform thickness and converted to the necessary mathematical form for the analysis purpose the geometrical parameters of the shell panel geometries are length a width b thickness h in ξ 1 ξ 2 and ζ directions respectively utilized for defining the shell geometry including the principal radii of curvature r ξ 1 and r ξ 2 along the ξ 1 and ξ 2 directions respectively at the mid plane ζ 0 of the shell and twist radius of curvature r ξ 1 ξ 2 is assumed to be infinite the global coordinate system ξ 1 ξ 2 ζ is located at the mid plane of the laminated shell panel with ζ in the vertical direction the different configuration of the panel geometries can be achieved by choosing the curvature suitably say cylindrical shell r ξ 1 r r ξ 2 spherical r ξ 1 r r ξ 2 r elliptical r ξ 1 r r ξ 2 2 r hyperboloid r ξ 1 r r ξ 2 r and plate r ξ 1 r ξ 2 2 2 deformation kinematics for the modeling purpose two well established higher order kinematics are utilized in this investigation to display the state space variables of any point within the material continuum of the laminated composite curved shell panel and termed as host 1 and host 2 the displacement kinematics of the host 1 and host 2 is considered to be nine and ten degrees of freedom dof respectively now the host 1 and host 2 are expressed as same as in reddy and liu 1985 1 host 1 u ξ 1 ξ 2 ζ u 0 1 ζ r 1 ζ ϕ 1 ζ 2 ψ 1 ζ 3 θ 1 v ξ 1 ξ 2 ζ v 0 1 ζ r 2 ζ ϕ 2 ζ 2 ψ 2 ζ 3 θ 2 w ξ 1 ξ 2 ζ w 0 2 host 2 u ξ 1 ξ 2 ζ u 0 1 ζ r 1 ζ ϕ 1 ζ 2 ψ 1 ζ 3 θ 1 v ξ 1 ξ 2 ζ v 0 1 ζ r 2 ζ ϕ 2 ζ 2 ψ 2 ζ 3 θ 2 w ξ 1 ξ 2 ζ w 0 ζ ϕ 3 where u v and w are the displacements of any point along the curvilinear coordinate directions i e ξ 1 ξ 2 and ζ respectively the displacement functions say u 0 v 0 and w 0 are the displacements defined at the mid plane of the panel structure including the rotations of normals ϕ 1 and ϕ 2 about the corresponding ξ 2 and ξ 1 axes respectively the remaining mathematical functions in the displacement fields say ϕ 3 ψ 1 ψ 2 θ 1 and θ 2 are the necessary higher order terms of taylor s series expansion defined at the mid plane to maintain the parabolic variation of the shear stresses however the present formulation deals with the shallow shell panel which holds the relation 1 r ξ 1 1 r ξ 2 1 so the terms 1 ξ r ξ 1 and 1 ξ r ξ 2 can be equated to unity in equations 1 and 2 and modified form can be given as 3 u ξ 1 ξ 2 ζ u 0 ζ ϕ 1 ζ 2 ψ 1 ζ 3 θ 1 v ξ 1 ξ 2 ζ v 0 ζ ϕ 2 ζ 2 ψ 2 ζ 3 θ 2 w ξ 1 ξ 2 ζ w 0 4 u ξ 1 ξ 2 ζ u 0 ζ ϕ 1 ζ 2 ψ 1 ζ 3 θ 1 v ξ 1 ξ 2 ζ v 0 ζ ϕ 2 ζ 2 ψ 2 ζ 3 θ 2 w ξ 1 ξ 2 ζ w 0 ζ ϕ 3 further the delaminated shell panel has been modeled mathematically using the kinematic model as in ju et al 1995 with few modifications to maintain the same variables as well as the necessary continuity in equations 3 and 4 similar to the laminated segment the mid plane displacement functions of the delaminated segment already having p number of delamination as in fig 2 is defined another coordinates o ξ 1 ξ 2 and ζ can be expressed as 5 u ξ 1 ξ 2 ζ u 0 ζ ϕ 1 ζ 2 ψ 1 ζ 3 θ 1 v ξ 1 ξ 2 ζ v 0 ζ ϕ 2 ζ 2 ψ 2 ζ 3 θ 2 w ξ 1 ξ 2 ζ w 0 6 u ξ 1 ξ 2 ζ u 0 ζ ϕ 1 ζ 2 ψ 1 ζ 3 θ 1 v ξ 1 ξ 2 ζ v 0 ζ ϕ 2 ζ 2 ψ 2 ζ 3 θ 2 w ξ 1 ξ 2 ζ w 0 ζ ϕ 3 here the displacement functions are also replicate the same values as in the laminate case i e u v and w are the displacements of a general point in the direction of ξ 1 ξ 2 and ζ respectively including u 0 v 0 and w 0 are the displacements of a point on the mid plane and ϕ 1 and ϕ 2 are the rotations of the normal to the mid plane about ξ 2 and ξ 1 axis respectively the parameters ϕ 3 ψ 1 ψ 2 θ 1 and θ 2 are higher order terms of taylor series expansion defined at the mid plane 2 3 strain displacement relation the generalized nonlinear deformation of the laminated structure with and without internal damage is modeled using the following green s strain in lagrangian space as in reddy 2004 7 ε i j ε ξ 1 ξ 1 ε ξ 2 ξ 2 ε ζ ζ ε ξ 2 ζ ε ξ 1 ζ ε ξ 1 ξ 2 u ξ 1 w r 1 v ξ 2 w r 2 w ζ v ζ w ξ 2 v r 2 u ζ w ξ 1 u r 1 u ξ 2 v ξ 1 2 w r 12 1 2 u ξ 1 w r 1 2 v ξ 1 w r 12 2 w ξ 1 u r 1 2 1 2 u ξ 2 w r 12 2 v ξ 2 w r 2 2 w ξ 2 v r 2 2 1 2 u ζ 2 v ζ 2 w ζ 2 u ξ 2 w r 12 u ζ v ξ 2 w r 2 v ζ w ξ 2 v r 2 w ζ u ξ 1 w r 1 u ζ v ξ 1 w r 12 v ζ w ξ 1 u r 1 w ζ u ξ 1 w r 1 u ξ 2 w r 12 v ξ 1 w r 12 v ξ 2 w r 2 w ξ 1 u r 1 w ξ 2 v r 2 8 ε i j ε l ε n l where ε l and ε n l are the linear and nonlinear strain tensors respectively now the individual mid plane strains are obtained by substituting the corresponding displacement fields i e equations 3 and 4 into equation 7 and conceded as 9 ε i j ε ξ 1 ξ 1 0 ε ξ 2 ξ 2 0 ε ζ ζ 0 ε ξ 2 ζ 0 ε ξ 1 ζ 0 ε ξ 1 ξ 2 0

strains the details of the thickness coefficient matrices can be seen in the references singh and panda 2014 mahapatra and panda 2015 in this study the strain displacement relations are provided only for the host 2 cases for the sake of brevity it is noteworthy to mention that the expressions could be formed for the host 1 model by dropping the necessary terms from the displacement and strain displacement relations 2 4 laminate constitutive relations the generalized stress strain relations for any material continuum which kth layer is oriented at an arbitrary angle θ about any arbitrary axes are given by 10 σ i j k q i j ε i j k where σ i j q i j and ε i j are the stress tensor the elastic coefficient matrix and the strain tensor respectively jones 1975 2 5 energy calculation the total strain energy of the laminated shell panel due to the mechanical loading is computed using the necessary stress and strain tensors and reported as 11 u 1 2 k 1 n ζ k 1 ζ k ε i j t σ i j d ζ d ξ 1 d ξ 2 2 6 work done the total work done due to the applied transverse mechanical load f is expressed in the following form 12 w a δ t f d a 2 7 finite element formulation the most of the numerical analysis of laminated structure is investigated using the fem due to the easy applicability to the problems associated with the material and geometrical complexities hence a suitable isoparametric fem step is implemented for the modeling of the current shell structure including delamination for the discretisation purpose in this study a nine noded quadrilateral lagrangian element with nine and ten degrees of freedom per node is considered according to the type of model i e the host 1 and the host 2 respectively the details regarding the nodal polynomial functions of the present isoparametric element can be seen from the source cook et al 2000 now the displacement filed vector over each of the element can be expressed as follows 13 δ i 1 9 n i δ i where n i and δ i are nodal interpolation functions and the nodal displacement vectors respectively the nodal displacement vector for the proposed models i e the host 1 and the host 2 are represented as δ i u 0 i v 0 i w 0 i ϕ 1 i ϕ 2 i ψ 1 i ψ 2 i θ 1 i θ 2 i t and δ i u 0 i v 0 i w 0 i ϕ 1 i ϕ 2 i ϕ 3 i ψ 1 i ψ 2 i θ 1 i θ 2 i t respectively after introducing the fe steps the linear and the nonlinear mid plane strain vectors can be rewritten in terms of nodal displacement vectors and conceded to the following form 14 ε l b δ i ε n l a g δ i where b and g are the strain displacement matrices of the linear and the nonlinear strain vectors respectively however a is the displacements dependent matrix i e the linear displacement will be taken as the input to form the necessary matrix the individual terms of all individual matrices i e a b and g can be seen in singh and panda 2014 mahapatra and panda 2015 for the corresponding kinematic models as said previously the elemental stiffness k can be further expressed as in the following line 15 k a k 1 n ζ k 1 ζ k b t d l b d z d a 1 2 a k 1 n ζ k 1 ζ k b t d n l 1 a g d z d a a k 1 n ζ k 1 ζ k g t a t d n l 2 b d z d a 1 2 a k 1 n ζ k 1 ζ k g t a t d n l 3 a g d z d a 16 k k l k l k n l 1 k n l 2 k n l 3 k n l and d l ζ k 1 ζ k h l t q k h l d n l 1 ζ k 1 ζ k h l t q k h n l d n l 2 ζ k 1 ζ k h n l t q k h l d n l 3 ζ k 1 ζ k h n l t q k h n l in order to maintain the brevity the detailed derivation regarding the stiffness calculation of delaminated segment is not provided however the elemental stiffness k matrix of the delaminated segment can easily be obtained by reiterating the steps from equations 7 16 2 8 conditions for the displacement continuity in the earlier sections the element in the laminated and the delaminated segments are derived separately with the assumption that all the variables in the displacement kinematics are independent however at the sharing boundaries of both the segment the displacement continuity condition for the displacement field must be satisfied in order to understand the same in a more clear way a panel with the elements in both the laminated and delaminated segment is presented in fig 3 for the easy readability two elements are named as element e 1 and element e 2 in the laminate and delaminate segments respectively it is easy to visualize that there are three nodes in the sharing boundaries say 1 4 and 8 for the common nodes 1 4 and 8 the displacement field variable are represented as 17 δ i u 0 i v 0 i w 0 i ϕ 1 i ϕ 2 i ϕ 3 i ψ 1 i ψ 2 i θ 1 i θ 2 i t for e 1 18 δ i u 0 i v 0 i w 0 i ϕ 1 i ϕ 2 i ϕ 3 i ψ 1 i ψ 2 i θ 1 i θ 2 i t for e 2 now the continuity conditions for the displacement at the sharing boundaries are expressed as 19 u 0 i u 0 i e ϕ 1 i e 2 ψ 1 i e 3 θ 1 i v 0 i v 0 i e ϕ 2 i e 2 ψ 2 i e 3 θ 2 i w 0 i w 0 i ϕ 1 i ϕ 1 i ϕ 2 i ϕ 2 i ϕ 3 i ϕ 3 i ψ 1 i ψ 1 i ψ 2 i ψ 2 i θ 1 i θ 1 i θ 2 i θ 2 i where e denotes the distance between the mid plane of the laminate e 1 and the delaminated e 2 elements for the presently proposed conditions i e equation 19 helps to maintain the continuity throughout and allow the models to the detention of the global mechanical responses however the present formulation does not consider any local effect like the perturbation of the stress field around the point of initiation of the deboning but the consideration of the system of exact kinematic conditions sekc describes as in szekrenyes 2013 account for the local effect for the similar type of analysis now equation 19 is rewritten in the matrix form and expressed as 20 δ i λ δ i for i 1 4 and 8 where λ is the coefficient matrix the detail components of this matrix for both the models can be seen in hirwani et al 2016 now using equations 3 and 4 the following transformations of the element e 2 is provided in the following lines 21 δ f δ where 22 δ δ 1 δ 2 δ 3 δ 4 δ 5 δ 6 δ 7 δ 8 δ 9 t 23 f d i a g λ i i λ i i i λ i where the matrix i is 9 9 and 10 10 identity matrices for host 1 and host 2 respectively it is important to discuss that λ will have the considerable value for the sharing node otherwise it is an identity matrix as mentioned in equation 23 now the transformations for the element stiffness and mass matrices of the debonded element e 2 can be expressed as 24 k f t k f after the successful implementation of continuity conditions the elemental stiffness matrix k and nodal displacement vector δ i will be replaced by k and δ i for the node at sharing boundaries further the modified elemental stiffness k will be utilized to frame the global stiffness matrices via assembly steps as in the fem 2 9 system governing equations the necessary equilibrium equation for the static analysis of the laminated composites shell panel is obtained by minimizing the total potential energy expression and conceded as 25 u w 0 where is the potential energy functional expression due to the external transverse mechanical load now the final form of the bending equilibrium equation of the laminated structure under the transverse mechanical load is expressed by substitution equations 11 and 12 into equation 25 26 k δ f where k and f are the global stiffness matrix and global force vectors respectively 2 10 end constraint conditions now equation 26 is solved by imposing the following end constraints at each side of the panel simply supported case v 0 w 0 ϕ 2 ϕ 3 ψ 2 θ 2 0 at ξ 1 0 and a u 0 w 0 ϕ 1 ϕ 3 ψ 1 θ 1 0 at ξ 2 0 and b clamped case u 0 v 0 w 0 ϕ 1 ϕ 2 ϕ 3 ψ 1 ψ 2 θ 1 θ 2 at ξ 1 0 and a at ξ 2 0 and b 3 results and discussion the nonlinear static deflections of debonded composite curved shell panel under the influence two types of quasi static mechanical load are computed numerically with the help of presently developed host based nonlinear fe models the rate of convergence of the proposed higher order fe solutions have been checked for different mesh densities and compared with those available published results to verify the accuracy also the transverse deflection responses are computed experimentally for the comparison purpose with the help of three point bend test using the in house fabricated woven glass fiber reinforced epoxy composite plate including the artificial debonding at national institute of technology rourkela nit rourkela for the numerical calculation the elastic properties of the laminated composite are evaluated experimentally using uniaxial tensile test in addition different kind of numerical examples has been solved to examine the influences of the geometrical parameter debonding size location and position on nonlinear static deflection strength of the laminated curved panel as mentioned previously two types of mechanical loading have been considered for the present computational analysis namely uniformly distributed load udl and sinusoidal load sdl where udl and sdl follow the relation q q 0 and q q 0 sin π ξ 1 a sin π ξ 2 b respectively the material properties used in the current numerical analysis including the experimentally evaluated properties are provided in table 1 the present study utilized three different sizes of debonding and represented as a ratio of side length i e c a where c and a are the lengths of the delamination and parent panel along the longitudinal directions respectively in this analysis three debonding sizes are utilized say c a 0 25 0 5 and 0 75 including the laminate case c a 0 where the value is set to be zero further the deflection responses are presented in nondimensional form say w w h where w is the maximum deflection at the center of the panel else stated otherwise 3 1 convergence and comparison of the present results the convergence rate of the present nonlinear numerical solution has been established by solving an arbitrary example with the help of proposed higher order fe models host 1 and host 2 the nonlinear deflection parameters are computed for the square a b 0 25 m four layer antisymmetric cross ply 0 90 2 cylindrical shell panel a h 50 with simply supported boundaries under two mechanical loading udl and sdl it is also necessary to mention that the responses are computed for four different curvature ratios r a 5 10 20 and 50 to address the effect of curvature on the deflection responses and the mesh densities the material property mat 1 is used and the computed responses are presented in fig 4 a b from the figures it could be easily concluded that the results are converging well with different mesh densities and an 8 8 mesh sufficient to compute the desired responses and is utilized further throughout the analysis further the transverse deflections of the simply supported square eight layer 0 8 laminated composite plate are computed numerically under udl type of mechanical load the computed deflections are obtained via the presently proposed higher order kinematic models compared with the available open literature results zhang and kim 2006 argyris and tenek 1994 and depicted in table 2 for the solution of this example the material properties and the geometrical parameters are taken as same as the references in addition another validation study is reported with the reference reddy and liu 1985 for the simply supported spherical shell panel with three different stacking sequences 0 90 0 90 0 and 0 90 90 0 under the sdl type of loading and presented in table 3 the results are also calculated using the same input parameters as in the reference reddy and liu 1985 and compared with that of the fost and the host solutions from the same reference in continuation to the earlier studies further the deflection responses of the laminated composite cylindrical shell panel with and without internal debonding c a 0 25 under the mechanical udl is examined using the newly developed numerical models in this study the nondimensional transverse central line deflection along the panel length is examined and subsequent comparisons are made with fost result of nanda 2014 and presented in fig 5 the geometrical configurations and the composite properties for this numerical example are taken same as in reference nanda 2014 from the comparison tables and the figure it is understood that the present linear and or nonlinear results of the flat curved structure with and without internal damage are within expected line and few deviations between the results exist due to the difference in modeling and solution techniques respectively 3 2 debonded laminated plate fabrication steps in order to conduct the experimental investigation glass epoxy composite plate with and without artificial delamination have been fabricated at national institute of technology rourkela nit rourkela using the hand lay up method now the detail of the fabrication process is provided in the following lines first of all the necessary materials such as woven glass fiber in a required size and number epoxy lapox l 12 hardener k 6 wooden mould roller mould release spray polyvinyl alcohol plastic sheet have been arranged further the epoxy and the corresponding hardener 10 1 wt ratio are mixed together with proper care i e avoiding the bubbles formation in the mixture the fabrication steps start with the application of mould release agent on the plastic sheet and further it is laid down on the flat wooden platform now the thin layer of the gel is coated with the help of brush on the plastic sheet and the woven glass fiber is placed and pressed with the help of roller to avoid any void formations the process is repeated till the plane of delamination where artificial delamination needs to place the artificial delamination of required size at the particular location is incorporated using a teflon tape fig 6 a after the incorporation of the delamination same or different numbers of woven glass fiber are placed following the same steps as discussed previously after completing the above steps another plastic sheet is placed at the top of the laminate now the laminate is processed for the pre curing in the hot press fig 6 b at 60 c for 30 min and then left for post curing in the ambient condition for two days finally the plastic sheet at the top and bottom of the laminate are removed and the composite is stored in an air tied atmosphere the above described process is utilized to fabricate the three sets of the flat laminated composite using eight layers of woven glass fabric the first set of glass fiber reinforced polymer gfrp composite are obtained by fabricating the laminate with three different sizes of artificial debonding c a 0 0 25 and 0 5 at the centre mid plane of the laminate as shown in fig 7 similarly a debonding c a 0 25 is seeded at the centre of the different interfaces i 1 i 2 i 3 and i 4 fig 8 to get the second set of the delaminated flat composite further the third set is prepared by incorporating the artificial damage c a 0 25 at the different locations left 1 left 2 middle right 1 and right 2 as depicted in fig 9 3 3 material property evaluation now the elastic properties of the fabricated gfrp composite plate are obtained with the help of uniaxial tensile test the standard specimens for the testing are prepared as per the astm standard astm d 3039 3039m and their details are given in fig 10 a the specimen is cut along three different directions say longitudinal transverse and 45 inclined to the longitudinal direction to get the desired young s modulus say e ξ 1 e ξ 2 and e 45 respectively further the test is performed using the universal testing machine utm instron 1195 fig 10 b at nit rourkela by setting the loading rate of 1 mm min to avoid the distortion of the specimens as discussed previously the shear modulus is evaluated with the help of mathematical relation g ξ 1 ξ 2 4 e 45 1 e ξ 1 1 e ξ 2 2 υ ξ 1 ξ 2 e ξ 1 1 it is necessary to mention that poisson s ratio is taken to be 0 17 from the earlier published open literature mohanty et al 2012 the final set of material property is found out by averaging the three result of each sample to avoid the discrepancy as well as ensure the accuracy of the desired properties and presented in table 1 mat 2 3 4 experimental evaluation of static deflection and comparison with numerical result first of all the sample specimens for the three point bend test is prepared according to the astm standard astm 790 and presented in fig 11 a the test is performed for all the three sets of the laminated delaminated composite using a 30 kn capacity universal testing machine utm instron 5967 fig 11 b at nit rourkela for the test purpose the loading rate of 2 mm min is kept fixed for all the experimentation and the deflections are imported from the machine and saved corresponding to the data sheet of each sample now for the comparison purpose the nonlinear static deflections of the all the set of laminated delaminated composite are computed numerically with the help of presently developed higher order fe models it is important to mention that the numerical responses are obtained for plate dimension 48mm 16mm 3 mm using the experimental material property mat 2 in table 1 further the co ordinate for the different location of the delamination is provided in table 4 the numerically computed result for all the three sets of delaminated composite i e size position and location are now compared with those of the corresponding experimental results and provided in the corresponding tables i e tables 5 7 respectively from the tables it can be easily pointed out that the responses obtained via the host 2 are showing close values for all three cases i e the size location and position of delamination when compared to the host 1 all most each case the differences are below 10 when the delamination size increases however the results show negligible error 1 for the location as well as the position it is mainly due to the fact that the host 2 model is derived by taking the thickness stretching effect and large deformation behavior through green lagrange strain displacement relation 3 5 additional numerical analysis the convergence and subsequent comparison studies including the experimental validation indicates the capability of the presently developed higher order nonlinear kinematic models to solve the variety of geometrical nonlinear problem of damaged laminated flat curved composite structure based on the above conclusion the models are now employed to solve a series of numerical illustrations to demonstrate the applicability of the said models and have the better insight of the certain design parameter effect on the nonlinear bending characteristics in this section for all the illustration a square laminate a b 0 25 m under the transverse load of magnitude 0 1 mpa is considered using the mat 1 material property else stated otherwise the nonlinear deflection parameters are presented in the nondimensional form using the same formulae said previously w w h 3 6 influence of side to thickness ratio on nonlinear static bending responses of delaminated elliptical shell panel in this illustration a four layer cross ply 0 90 0 90 elliptical shell panel r a 20 with the simply supported constraint is analysed for different size of delamination under the mechanical udl and sdl type of loading the nondimensional transverse central displacements for the five different side to thickness ratios a h 10 20 30 40 and 50 is computed employing the proposed higher order models and shown in fig 12 a b it is observed from the results that the deflection parameters increased with increasing of the side to thickness ratio irrespective of the size of delamination with the increase in side to thickness ratio the thickness of the panel and overall stiffness decreases result in the deflection responses increases additionally a significant increase in nonlinear deflection parameter has also been observed with increase in the size of the deboning and the results are within the expected line 3 7 influence of curvature ratio on nonlinear bending responses of delaminated composite hyperboloid shell panel the nondimensional transverse central displacement of clamped four layer cross ply 0 90 0 90 hyperboloid shell panel with different size of internal damage subjected to sdl and udl loading is examined for five different curvature ratio r a 5 10 20 50 and 100 and presented in fig 13 a b it is evident from the figures that the nonlinear deflection parameters increased irrespective of the size of internal damage when the curvature ratio increases it is because of the well known fact that the deep shell panel has the higher bending strength as compared to shallow shell panel and in this example the same situation occur when curvature ratio increases for the constant side length further the deflection parameters are following an increasing trend when the size of internal damage at the centre mid plane increases for both the mechanical loading i e sdl and udl loading also it is worthy to mention that the debonding of the consecutive layers of the laminate reduces the overall stiffness of the structural panel and it results the increase of the deflection values 3 8 influence of aspect ratio on nonlinear bending responses of delaminated composite spherical shell panel the effect of aspect ratio on the nonlinear static responses of the simply supported symmetric cross ply 0 90 90 0 delaminated spherical shell panel r a 20 and a h 50 under udl and sdl loading is studied numerically in this example the results are calculated using both the higher order models for different aspect ratios a b 1 1 5 2 2 5 and 3 and plotted in fig 14 a b the results indicate the notable effect of the aspect ratios on the transverse central displacement i e the central displacement values decreased with the increase in aspect ratios for both types of mechanical loading udl and sdl the deflection values are higher for the udl loading in comparison to the sdl type of loading it is due to the fact that the load magnitude is uniform in case of udl throughout the panel surface whereas the load varies from zero to maximum from the boundary to the mid plane for sinusoidal loading however the effect of the size of internal damage is same as discussed in the previous example for all five aspect ratios 3 9 influence of modular ratio on nonlinear bending responses of delaminated composite cylindrical shell panel the nonlinear bending strength of the clamped symmetric cross ply 0 90 90 0 cylindrical shell panel r a 20 and a h 50 with different size of delamination at the centre mid plane of the laminated under udl and sdl loading is investigated for the five different modular ratios and shown in fig 15 a b the figures show the reduction in nonlinear transverse displacement with an increase in the modular ratios as expected for the present case it is because when the modular ratio increased the global stiffness increase which in turn decreases the transverse deflection values subsequently the figures also show the significant increase in the displacement parameter as the area of debonding increases between two consecutive layers irrespective of the loading conditions 3 10 influence of size of debonding on nonlinear bending responses of delaminated composite spherical shell panel in order to demonstrate the effect of the delamination size on the nonlinear static responses a simply supported spherical shell panel 0 90 90 0 s example is solved using the design parameters a h 50 and r a 50 under two loadings udl and sdl the responses transverse centerline deflection along length and width are evaluated for the different sizes of debonding areas fig 7 with the help of presently developed nonlinear fe models and depicted in fig 16 a d the interesting outcome reveals that the delamination size has the significant effect on the deflection parameter i e as the increase in the debonding sizes the overall structural integrity stiffness decrease which in turn increases the deflection parameter further it is important to discuss that the effect of debonding size is independent of loading 3 11 influence of delamination position on nonlinear bending responses of delaminated composites elliptical shell panel the debonding not always initiated at the centre of mid plane of the laminated structure but it may arise at any interfaces as well in a real situation so it is a matter of concern that the debonding at every interface is equally important or the emphasis has to be given for the debonding at any particular interface in order to understand such case an example of elliptical shell panel with the delamination c a 0 5 at the different interfaces is investigated under udl and sdl types of loading the detailed position of the delamination can be seen in fig 8 for the computation a clamped eight layer 0 90 0 90 s elliptical shell panel is investigated numerically by setting the thickness and curvature ratios as 50 and 20 respectively the nonlinear transverse centerline displacement along the length and the width of the elliptical shell panel are calculated and plotted in fig 17 a d the deformation characteristic is found to be maximum for the middle interface i 1 and it starts falling as the debonding moves in other interfaces i e i 2 i 3 and i 4 and it is lowest for the interface i 4 the above trend clearly indicates that the debonding at the mid plane is more significant than any other interfaces away from the mid plane 3 12 influence of location of debonded area on nonlinear bending responses of delaminated hyperboloid composite shell panel the significance of the debonding size and the position is already demonstrated in the earlier example now the effect of location of the debonding area on the nonlinear static responses of doubly curved shell panel has been illustrated in this example by shifting the debonded area into five different locations left right middle top and bottom on the mid plane of the laminated plate as shown in fig 18 the responses are computed numerically for the simply supported hyperboloid shell panel a h 50 r a 20 with rectangular a 2b delamination c a 0 25 and antisymmetric cross ply 0 90 0 90 s lay up sequences under the udl and sdl type of loading the nonlinear transverse centerline displacement along the length x a and width y b are calculated using presently developed fe models and presented in fig 19 a d the figures indicate the significant effect of the change in location of the debonding area on the nonlinear responses in addition it is interesting to note that the responses follow the same trend and equal magnitude for the left or right shift of delamination irrespective of the models and loading conditions 3 13 influence of size of debonding on in plane stress of cylindrical shell panel in this example the influence of delamination sizes on the stress is demonstrated for the analysis a simply supported cylindrical shell panel with cross ply laminations 0 90 90 0 is examined using the side to thickness and the curvature ratios as 50 and 60 respectively under two types of mechanical loading udl and sdl the stress values are computed through the thickness using both the host models and shown in fig 20 a b the responses are calculated using the mat 3 type of properties and setting the load 100 kn from the figures the increasing trend of stress values is found with the increase in delamination sizes it is worthy to discuss here that the present results calculated using the constitutive relations in this example the stresses are expressed in the nondimensional form using the formulae as σ n d σ a h 2 e ξ 2 respectively 4 conclusive remarks the nonlinear static deflections of the laminated composite shell structures are computed numerically with the help of new nonlinear mathematical model based on the higher order kinematic theories including green lagrange nonlinear strains and all the nonlinear higher order strain terms the responses are evaluated via a generic computer code prepared in matlab environment the convergence and the validation study of the proposed nonlinear numerical models have been performed by computing an adequate number of numerical examples in addition the responses are computed experimentally with the help of three point bend test on in house fabricated woven glass epoxy laminate composite plate including different sizes of the delamination in order to add more confidence as well as the superiority of the proposed numerical study the present results are compared with those of the experimental data lastly the applicability of the developed models has been explored by solving few new examples which show the influences of the material and geometrical parameter on the nonlinear static behavior of the curved shell panel on the basis of the numerical and the experimental investigation the following conclusive remarks have been put forward for the better understanding the validation studies indicate that the results of the presently developed nonlinear higher order models are in line with those of the earlier published result further the confidence on the present models has also been added by comparing the present static deflections with that of the experimental nonlinear bending responses of internally damaged glass epoxy laminate various numerical interpretations indicate the significant effect of the damage on the nonlinear static behavior i e the presence of debonding reduces the total structural deformation bearing capacity and increases the deflection responses in addition the presence of the debonding at the mid plane middle interface of the laminate is more crucial than any other interface away from the mid plane the debonding nearer to the constrained boundary does not affect the overall stiffness and static responses significantly in comparison to centrally located debonding the result indicates that the stress and the deflection parameters affected considerably due to increase in the size of internal debonding i e following an increasing trend with the increase in the size of the debonding irrespective of the type of loading 
23370,in the present article nonlinear static deflections of internally damaged shear deformable laminated composite curved single and doubly shell panel are investigated numerically under the quasi static loading and validated with experimental results for the numerical analysis a general nonlinear mathematical model of the laminated composite curved shell panel including the effect of the

carried out for the comparison purpose via three point bend test on the laminated glass epoxy composite with artificial delamination lastly numbers of numerical examples are solved to demonstrate the implicit behavior of the currently developed higher order nonlinear model for the analysis of the pre damaged layered structure keywords nonlinear bending delaminated composite panel experimental validation mechanical load host 1 introduction since last few decades the application of layered composites material has been increased rapidly in the manufacturing the weight sensitive and high performance structures in civil construction marine aircraft aerospace and automobile industries due to their excellent property and ability to be tailored for particular applications gay and hoa 2007 most commonly the laminated composite structure does not have any reinforcement in the thickness direction which leads to the high inter laminar shear stress and subsequent separation of the consecutive layers the separation of the layer generally termed to be delamination or debonding may arise due to the several reasons and in several ways some of the common reasons are entrapment of air pockets or foreign particles incomplete curing material and geometric discontinuity during the manufacturing and eccentric and low velocity impact loading during service life sridharan 2008 the presence of internal debonding could affect the structural integrity and the structural performance significantly hence the thorough understanding and quantitative measurement of the influence of the debonding on the stiffness and structural responses of the laminated structure is very much essential in order to identify the necessary gaps of the earlier studies on the delaminated structure a comprehensive review of the previously published literature is discussed in the following lines and subsequent objective of the present article also framed accordingly the present review is mainly focused on the two major issues i e the solution techniques adopted for the desired structural responses and the mid plane kinematics used for the mathematical modeling purpose of the laminated delaminated structure in the early nineties the transverse deflection behavior of laminated composite curved shell panels single and doubly are investigated numerically by reddy and chandrashekhara 1985 using finite element fe model based on the extended sander s shell theory including the von karman type of geometrical nonlinear strain displacement relations similarly fe steps are further utilized to examine the nonlinear bending and the stress behavior of the laminated composites plate by barbero and reddy 1990 using the generalized laminated plate theory glpt in conjunction with von karman nonlinear strain the fe solutions of the nonlinear static and the transient responses of the laminated composite plate are reported by chang and huang 1991 based on the higher order mid plane theory and von karman geometrical nonlinearity also the nonlinear fe steps are employed to compute the bending strength of the doubly curved laminated composite as well as the sandwich shell panels by kant and kommineni 1992 1994 using the higher order kinematic theory and von karman strains the nonlinear static and dynamic fe solutions of the laminated composites plate are reported by ganapathi et al 1996 for the laminated structure using an eight noded quadrilateral element and von karman strain displacement relations further a new plate shell triangular element is developed by zhang and kim 2005 to compute the geometrical nonlinear deflection parameters of the laminated plate based on the first order mid plane kinematics later the first order shear deformation theory fost type of mid plane kinematics along with von karman geometrical nonlinear strains are utilized by baltacıoglu et al 2010 for the computation of the flexural strength of the orthotropic laminated structure via numerical methods the effect of combined pressure and thermal loading on the nonlinear flexural behavior of the laminated composite plate resting on an elastic foundation is analysed by shen 2000 the closed form solution of the fundamental frequency and flexural behavior of the sandwich shell panel is presented first time by biglari and jafari 2010 with the help of newly developed three layered higher order mixed theory gupta et al 2013 reported the fe solutions of the nonlinear flexural responses of the laminated composite plate with growing damage via the fost kinematics and von karman nonlinear strains likewise the static buckling flutter and dynamic responses of the functionally graded material fgm plate structure using the fe associated non uniform rational b spline method by valizadeh et al 2013 in the framework of the fost kinematics in contrast to the finite element method fem galerkin kriging in association with the meshfree approach also employed to compute the buckling and the flexural characteristic of the laminated composite plate by bui and nguyen 2013 the nonlinear fe solutions of the large deflection transverse bending characteristics of the fgm sandwich plate is computed using the refined plate theory and von karman nonlinearity by kaci et al 2013 further the four variable refined plate theory is developed first time to investigate the static responses of the fgm plate by benatta et al 2014 including the geometrical nonlinearity under the pressure loading similarly the fe technique has been implemented to examine the modal responses of thick and thin laminated structure by tornabene et al 2017 in the framework of the equivalent layerwise theory unlike the other available techniques the explicit dynamic relaxation method has been employed by alamatian and rezaeepazhand 2016 for the analysis of the nonlinear static characteristic of the laminated composite plate with variable cross sections malta and martin malta et al 2017 investigated numerically the effect of compressive load on the five layer flexible pipe using 3d nonlinear fe model now the articles reviewed in this section for the structure or the structural components with internal damage and solved using various numerical analytical technique including the large finite deformation effect the influence of the generation and the propagation of the transverse crack on the stiffness behavior of the angle ply laminated composites plate is reported by amara et al 2006 further the delaminated composite beam is analysed numerically by hicks et al 2003 using the energy method in association with the fe approach and compared with subsequent experimental results similarly the effect of delamination on the laminated tube and bar structures are computed using the simulation model by carneiro and savi vieira and savi 2000 wang and shenoi 2003 proposed a new modeling approach based on the linear curved beam theory including the fracture mechanics for the analysis of the delaminated composite curved beam likewise the dynamic characteristics of the laminated composite structure with delamination are modeled using the sub laminate approach by manoach et al 2016 the progressive failure analysis of the damaged layered composite structure with and without stiffener is presented by riccio et al 2016 2017a 2017b the system of exact kinematic condition sekc steps have been employed to evaluate the dynamic characteristics by szekrényes 2015 to study the effect of delamination through the width of the plate to main the kinematic continuity between the laminated and debonded composite further the updated version of sekc approach is introduced by szekrényes 2016 to examine the mechanical responses of delaminated composite plates using different mid plane kinematic first second and third order plate theories similarly the effect of the location and the length of the delamination are investigated by using new artificial immune system method bazardehi et al 2012 mohebbi et al 2013 the extensive review of the literature reveals that the various work has been attempted and reported on the linear nonlinear flexural strength of the laminated composite curve and flat panel is mainly using von karman type of geometrical nonlinear strains in the framework of fost and host higher order shear deformation theory mid plane kinematics in addition the damaged laminated composite panel model also focused on the edge debonding rather than internal debonding however both types of debonding phenomena in the laminate structures are equally important and cannot be avoided to the best of the authors knowledge no fe modeling has been discussed or reported yet in the open literature which accounts the large deformation in green lagrange type of nonlinear strain kinematics in association with host mid plane theory considering the effect of internal damage using the sub laminate concept hence in the present work authors aim to develop a generic type of fe model for the laminated curved shell panel with internal damage in the framework of two host kinematic model and green lagrange nonlinear strain to evaluate the nonlinear transverse deflection under the quasi static type of mechanical load the necessary consistency behavior and the validity of the said higher order models have been established by solving an adequate number of examples further to show the inevitability of the proposed host kinematics the results are compared with experimental results of laminated glass epoxy composite plate with and without damage lastly the importance and effect of the geometrical and material parameters along with various size position and location of delamination on the nonlinear transverse deflection under two different mechanical load are computed and conferred in details 2 theory and formulation 2 1 geometry of the proposed shell panel the physical model of the doubly curved laminated composite shell panel fig 1 assumed to be consist of n number of orthotropic layers of uniform thickness and converted to the necessary mathematical form for the analysis purpose the geometrical parameters of the shell panel geometries are length a width b thickness h in ξ 1 ξ 2 and ζ directions respectively utilized for defining the shell geometry including the principal radii of curvature r ξ 1 and r ξ 2 along the ξ 1 and ξ 2 directions respectively at the mid plane ζ 0 of the shell and twist radius of curvature r ξ 1 ξ 2 is assumed to be infinite the global coordinate system ξ 1 ξ 2 ζ is located at the mid plane of the laminated shell panel with ζ in the vertical direction the different configuration of the panel geometries can be achieved by choosing the curvature suitably say cylindrical shell r ξ 1 r r ξ 2 spherical r ξ 1 r r ξ 2 r elliptical r ξ 1 r r ξ 2 2 r hyperboloid r ξ 1 r r ξ 2 r and plate r ξ 1 r ξ 2 2 2 deformation kinematics for the modeling purpose two well established higher order kinematics are utilized in this investigation to display the state space variables of any point within the material continuum of the laminated composite curved shell panel and termed as host 1 and host 2 the displacement kinematics of the host 1 and host 2 is considered to be nine and ten degrees of freedom dof respectively now the host 1 and host 2 are expressed as same as in reddy and liu 1985 1 host 1 u ξ 1 ξ 2 ζ u 0 1 ζ r 1 ζ ϕ 1 ζ 2 ψ 1 ζ 3 θ 1 v ξ 1 ξ 2 ζ v 0 1 ζ r 2 ζ ϕ 2 ζ 2 ψ 2 ζ 3 θ 2 w ξ 1 ξ 2 ζ w 0 2 host 2 u ξ 1 ξ 2 ζ u 0 1 ζ r 1 ζ ϕ

respectively the displacement functions say u 0 v 0 and w 0 are the displacements defined at the mid plane of the panel structure including the rotations of normals ϕ 1 and ϕ 2 about the corresponding ξ 2 and ξ 1 axes respectively the remaining mathematical functions in the displacement fields say ϕ 3 ψ 1 ψ 2 θ 1 and θ 2 are the necessary higher order terms of taylor s series expansion defined at the mid plane to maintain the parabolic variation of the shear stresses however the present formulation deals with the shallow shell panel which holds the relation 1 r ξ 1 1 r ξ 2 1 so the terms 1 ξ r ξ 1 and 1 ξ r ξ 2 can be equated to unity in equations 1 and 2 and modified form can be given as 3 u ξ 1 ξ 2 ζ u 0 ζ ϕ 1 ζ 2 ψ 1 ζ 3 θ 1 v ξ 1 ξ 2 ζ v 0 ζ ϕ 2 ζ 2 ψ 2 ζ 3 θ 2 w ξ 1 ξ 2 ζ w 0 4 u ξ 1 ξ

1995 with few modifications to maintain the same variables as well as the necessary continuity in equations 3 and 4 similar to the laminated segment the mid plane displacement functions of the delaminated segment already having p number of delamination as in fig 2 is defined another coordinates o ξ 1 ξ 2 and ζ can be expressed as 5 u ξ 1 ξ 2 ζ u 0 ζ ϕ 1 ζ 2 ψ 1 ζ 3 θ 1 v ξ 1 ξ 2 ζ v 0 ζ ϕ 2 ζ 2 ψ 2 ζ 3 θ 2 w ξ 1 ξ 2 ζ w 0 6 u ξ 1 ξ 2 ζ u 0 ζ ϕ 1 ζ 2 ψ 1 ζ 3 θ 1 v ξ 1 ξ 2 ζ v 0 ζ ϕ 2 ζ 2 ψ 2 ζ 3 θ 2 w ξ 1 ξ 2 ζ w 0 ζ ϕ 3 here the displacement functions are also replicate the same values as in the laminate case i e u v and w are the displacements of a general point in the direction of ξ 1 ξ 2 and ζ respectively including u 0 v 0 and w 0 are the displacements of a point on the mid plane and ϕ 1 and ϕ 2 are the rotations of the normal to the mid plane about ξ 2 and ξ 1 axis respectively the parameters ϕ 3 ψ 1 ψ 2 θ 1 and θ 2 are higher order terms of taylor series expansion defined at the mid plane 2 3 strain displacement relation the generalized nonlinear deformation of the laminated structure with and without internal damage is modeled using the following green s strain in lagrangian space as in reddy 2004 7 ε i j ε ξ 1 ξ 1 ε ξ 2 ξ 2 ε ζ ζ ε ξ 2 ζ ε ξ 1 ζ ε ξ 1 ξ 2 u ξ 1 w r 1 v ξ 2 w r 2 w ζ v ζ w ξ 2 v r 2 u ζ w ξ 1 u r 1 u ξ 2 v ξ 1 2 w r 12 1 2 u ξ 1 w r 1

strains the details of the thickness coefficient matrices can be seen in the references singh and panda 2014 mahapatra and panda 2015 in this study the strain displacement relations are provided only for the host 2 cases for the sake of brevity it is noteworthy to mention that the expressions could be formed for the host 1 model by dropping the necessary terms from the displacement and strain displacement relations 2 4 laminate constitutive relations the generalized stress strain relations for any material continuum which kth layer is oriented at an arbitrary angle θ about any arbitrary axes are given by 10 σ i j k q i j ε i j k where σ i j q i j and ε i j are the stress tensor the elastic coefficient matrix and the strain tensor respectively jones 1975 2 5 energy calculation the

analysis of laminated structure is investigated using the fem due to the easy applicability to the problems associated with the material and geometrical complexities hence a suitable isoparametric fem step is implemented for the modeling of the current shell structure including delamination for the discretisation purpose in this study a nine noded quadrilateral lagrangian element with nine and ten degrees of freedom per node is considered according to the type of model i e the host 1 and the host 2 respectively the details regarding the nodal polynomial functions of the present isoparametric element can be seen from the source cook et al 2000 now the displacement filed vector over each of the element can be expressed as follows 13 δ i 1 9 n i δ i where n i and δ i are nodal interpolation functions and the nodal displacement vectors respectively the nodal displacement vector for the proposed models i e the host 1 and the host 2 are represented as δ i u 0 i v 0 i w 0 i ϕ 1 i ϕ 2 i ψ 1 i ψ 2 i θ 1 i θ 2 i t and δ i u 0 i v 0 i w 0 i ϕ 1 i ϕ 2 i ϕ 3 i ψ 1 i ψ 2 i θ 1 i θ 2 i t respectively after introducing the fe steps the linear and the nonlinear mid plane strain vectors can be rewritten in terms of nodal displacement vectors and conceded to the following form 14 ε l b δ i ε n l a g δ i where b and g are the strain displacement matrices of the linear and the nonlinear strain vectors respectively however a is the displacements dependent matrix i e the linear displacement will be taken as the input to form the necessary matrix the individual terms of all individual matrices i e a b and g can be seen in singh and panda 2014 mahapatra and panda 2015 for the corresponding kinematic models as said previously the elemental stiffness k can be further expressed as in the

brevity the detailed derivation regarding the stiffness calculation of delaminated segment is not provided however the elemental stiffness k matrix of the delaminated segment can easily be obtained by reiterating the steps from equations 7 16 2 8 conditions for the displacement continuity in the earlier sections the element in the laminated and the delaminated segments are derived separately with the assumption that all the variables in the displacement kinematics are independent however at the sharing boundaries of both the segment the displacement continuity condition for the displacement field must be satisfied in order to understand the same in a more clear way a panel with the elements in both the laminated and delaminated segment is presented in fig 3 for the easy readability two elements are named as element e 1 and element e 2 in the laminate and delaminate segments respectively it is easy to visualize that there are three nodes in the sharing boundaries say 1 4 and 8 for the common nodes 1 4 and 8 the displacement field variable are represented as 17 δ i u 0 i v 0 i w 0 i ϕ 1 i ϕ 2 i ϕ 3 i ψ 1 i ψ 2 i θ 1 i θ 2 i t for e 1 18 δ i u 0 i v 0 i w 0 i ϕ 1 i ϕ 2 i ϕ 3 i ψ 1 i ψ 2 i θ 1 i θ 2 i t for e 2 now the continuity conditions for the displacement at the sharing boundaries are expressed as 19 u 0 i u 0 i e ϕ 1 i e 2 ψ 1 i e 3 θ 1 i v 0 i v 0 i e ϕ 2 i e 2 ψ 2 i e 3 θ 2 i w 0 i w 0 i ϕ 1 i ϕ 1 i ϕ 2 i ϕ 2 i ϕ 3 i ϕ 3 i ψ 1 i ψ 1 i ψ 2 i ψ 2 i θ 1 i θ 1 i θ 2 i θ 2 i where e denotes the distance between the mid plane of the laminate e 1 and the delaminated e 2 elements for the presently proposed conditions i e equation 19 helps to maintain the continuity throughout and allow the models to the detention of the global mechanical responses however the present formulation does not consider any local effect like the perturbation of the stress field around the point of initiation of the deboning but the consideration of the system of exact kinematic conditions sekc describes as in szekrenyes 2013 account for the local effect for the similar type of analysis now equation 19 is rewritten in the matrix form and expressed as 20 δ i λ δ i for i 1 4 and 8 where λ is the coefficient matrix the detail components of this matrix for both the models can be seen in hirwani et al 2016 now using equations 3 and 4 the following transformations of the element e 2 is provided in the following lines 21 δ f δ where 22 δ δ 1 δ 2 δ 3 δ 4 δ 5 δ 6 δ 7 δ 8 δ 9 t 23 f d i a g λ i i λ i i i λ i where the matrix i is 9 9 and 10 10 identity matrices for host 1 and host 2 respectively it is important to discuss that λ will have the considerable value for the sharing node otherwise it is an identity matrix as mentioned in equation 23 now the transformations for the element stiffness and mass matrices of the debonded element e 2 can be expressed as 24 k f t k f after the successful implementation of continuity conditions the elemental stiffness matrix k and nodal displacement vector δ i will be replaced by k and δ i for the node at sharing boundaries further the modified elemental stiffness k will be utilized to frame the global stiffness matrices via assembly steps as in the fem 2 9 system governing equations the necessary equilibrium equation for the static analysis of the laminated composites shell panel is obtained by minimizing the total potential energy expression and conceded as 25 u w 0 where is the potential energy functional expression due to the external transverse mechanical load now the final form of the bending equilibrium equation of the laminated structure under the transverse mechanical load is expressed by substitution equations 11 and 12 into equation 25 26 k δ f where k and f are the global stiffness matrix and global force vectors respectively 2 10 end constraint conditions now equation 26 is solved by imposing the following end constraints at each side of the panel simply supported case v 0 w 0 ϕ 2 ϕ 3 ψ 2 θ 2 0 at ξ 1 0 and a u 0 w 0 ϕ 1 ϕ 3 ψ 1 θ 1 0 at ξ 2 0 and b clamped case u 0 v 0 w 0 ϕ 1 ϕ 2 ϕ 3 ψ 1 ψ 2 θ 1 θ 2 at ξ 1 0 and a at ξ 2 0 and b 3 results and discussion the nonlinear static deflections of debonded composite curved shell panel under the influence two types of quasi static mechanical load are computed numerically with the help of presently developed host based nonlinear fe models the rate of convergence of the proposed higher order fe solutions have been checked for different mesh densities and compared with those available published results to verify the accuracy also the transverse deflection responses are computed experimentally for the comparison purpose with the help of three point bend test using the in house fabricated woven glass fiber reinforced epoxy composite plate including the artificial debonding at national institute of technology rourkela nit rourkela for the numerical calculation the elastic properties of the laminated composite are evaluated experimentally using uniaxial tensile test in addition different kind of numerical examples has been solved to examine the influences of the geometrical parameter debonding size location and position on nonlinear static deflection strength of the laminated curved panel as mentioned previously two types of mechanical loading have been considered for the present computational analysis namely uniformly distributed load udl and sinusoidal load sdl where udl and sdl follow the relation q q 0 and q q 0 sin π ξ 1 a sin π ξ 2 b respectively the material properties used in the current numerical analysis including the experimentally evaluated properties are provided in table 1 the present study utilized three different sizes of debonding and represented as a ratio of side length i e c a where c and a are the lengths of the delamination and parent panel along the longitudinal directions respectively in this analysis three debonding sizes are utilized say c a 0 25 0 5 and 0 75 including the laminate case c a 0 where the value is set to be zero further the deflection responses are presented in nondimensional form say w w h where w is the maximum deflection at the center of the panel else stated otherwise 3 1 convergence and comparison of the present results the convergence rate of the present nonlinear numerical solution has been established by solving an arbitrary example with the help of proposed higher order fe models host 1 and host 2 the nonlinear deflection parameters are computed for the square a b 0 25 m four layer antisymmetric cross ply 0 90 2 cylindrical shell panel a h 50 with simply supported boundaries under two mechanical loading udl and sdl it is also necessary to mention that the responses are computed for four different curvature ratios r a 5 10 20 and 50 to address the effect of curvature on the deflection responses and the mesh densities the material property mat 1 is used and the computed responses are presented in fig 4 a b from the figures it could be easily concluded that the results are converging well with different mesh densities and an 8 8 mesh sufficient to compute the desired responses and is utilized further throughout the analysis further the transverse deflections of the simply supported square eight layer 0 8 laminated composite plate are computed numerically under udl type of mechanical load the computed deflections are obtained via the presently proposed higher order kinematic models compared with the available open literature results zhang and kim 2006 argyris and tenek 1994 and depicted in table 2 for the solution of this example the material properties and the geometrical parameters are taken as same as the references in addition another validation study is reported with the reference reddy and liu 1985 for the simply supported spherical shell panel with three different stacking sequences 0 90 0 90 0 and 0 90 90 0 under the sdl type of loading and presented in table 3 the results are also calculated using the same input parameters as in the reference reddy and liu 1985 and compared with that of the fost and the host solutions from the same reference in continuation to the earlier studies further the deflection responses of the laminated composite cylindrical shell panel with and without internal debonding c a 0 25 under the mechanical udl is examined using the newly developed numerical models in this study the nondimensional transverse central line deflection along the panel length is examined and subsequent comparisons are made with fost result of nanda 2014 and presented in fig 5 the geometrical configurations and the composite properties for this numerical example are taken same as in reference nanda 2014 from the comparison tables and the figure it is understood that the present linear and or nonlinear results of the flat curved structure with and without internal damage are within expected line and few deviations between the results exist due to the difference in modeling and solution techniques respectively 3 2 debonded laminated plate fabrication steps in order to conduct the experimental investigation glass epoxy composite plate with and without artificial delamination have been fabricated at national institute of technology rourkela nit rourkela using the hand lay up method now the detail of the fabrication process is provided in the following lines first of all the necessary materials such as woven glass fiber in a required size and number epoxy lapox l 12 hardener k 6 wooden mould roller mould release spray polyvinyl alcohol plastic sheet have been arranged further the epoxy and the corresponding hardener 10 1 wt ratio are mixed together with proper care i e avoiding the bubbles formation in the mixture the fabrication steps start with the application of mould release agent on the plastic sheet and further it is laid down on the flat wooden platform now the thin layer of the gel is coated with the help of brush on the plastic sheet and the woven glass fiber is placed and pressed with the help of roller to avoid any void formations the process is repeated till the plane of delamination where artificial delamination needs to place the artificial delamination of required size at the particular location is incorporated using a teflon tape fig 6 a after the incorporation of the delamination same or different numbers of woven glass fiber are placed following the same steps as discussed previously after completing the above steps another plastic sheet is placed at the top of the laminate now the laminate is processed for the pre curing in the hot press fig 6 b at 60 c for 30 min and then left for post curing in the ambient condition for two days finally the plastic sheet at the top and bottom of the laminate are removed and the composite is stored in an air tied atmosphere the above described process is utilized to fabricate the three sets of the flat laminated composite using eight layers of woven glass fabric the first set of glass fiber reinforced polymer gfrp composite are obtained by fabricating the laminate with three different sizes of artificial debonding c a 0 0 25 and 0 5 at the centre mid plane of the laminate as shown in fig 7 similarly a debonding c a 0 25 is seeded at the centre of the different interfaces i 1 i 2 i 3 and i 4 fig 8 to get the second set of the delaminated flat composite further the third set is prepared by incorporating the artificial damage c a 0 25 at the different locations left 1 left 2 middle right 1 and right 2 as depicted in fig 9 3 3 material property evaluation now the elastic properties of the fabricated gfrp composite plate are obtained with the help of uniaxial tensile test the standard specimens for the testing are prepared as per the astm standard astm d 3039 3039m and their details are given in fig 10 a the specimen is cut along three different directions say longitudinal transverse and 45 inclined to the longitudinal direction to get the desired young s modulus say e ξ 1 e ξ 2 and e 45 respectively further the test is performed using the universal testing machine utm instron 1195 fig 10 b at nit rourkela by setting the loading rate of 1 mm min to avoid the distortion of the specimens as discussed previously the shear modulus is evaluated with the help of mathematical relation g ξ 1 ξ 2 4 e 45 1 e ξ 1 1 e ξ 2 2 υ ξ 1 ξ 2 e ξ 1 1 it is necessary to mention that poisson s ratio is taken to be 0 17 from the earlier published open literature mohanty et al 2012 the final set of material property is found out by averaging the three result of each sample to avoid the discrepancy as well as ensure the accuracy of the desired properties and presented in table 1 mat 2 3 4 experimental evaluation of static deflection and comparison with numerical result first of all the sample specimens for the three point bend test is prepared according to the astm standard astm 790 and presented in fig 11 a the test is performed for all the three sets of the laminated delaminated composite using a 30 kn capacity universal testing machine utm instron 5967 fig 11 b at nit rourkela for the test purpose the loading rate of 2 mm min is kept fixed for all the experimentation and the deflections are imported from the machine and saved corresponding to the data sheet of each sample now for the comparison purpose the nonlinear static deflections of the all the set of laminated delaminated composite are computed numerically with the help of presently developed higher order fe models it is important to mention that the numerical responses are obtained for plate dimension 48mm 16mm 3 mm using the experimental material property mat 2 in table 1 further the co ordinate for the different location of the delamination is provided in table 4 the numerically computed result for all the three sets of delaminated composite i e size position and location are now compared with those of the corresponding experimental results and provided in the corresponding tables i e tables 5 7 respectively from the tables it can be easily pointed out that the responses obtained via the host 2 are showing close values for all three cases i e the size location and position of delamination when compared to the host 1 all most each case the differences are below 10 when the delamination size increases however the results show negligible error 1 for the location as well as the position it is mainly due to the fact that the host 2 model is derived by taking the thickness stretching effect and large deformation behavior through green lagrange strain displacement relation 3 5 additional numerical analysis the convergence and subsequent comparison studies including the experimental validation indicates the capability of the presently developed higher order nonlinear kinematic models to solve the variety of geometrical nonlinear problem of damaged laminated flat curved composite structure based on the above conclusion the models are now employed to solve a series of numerical illustrations to demonstrate the applicability of the said models and have the better insight of the certain design parameter effect on the nonlinear bending characteristics in this section for all the illustration a square laminate a b 0 25 m under the transverse load of magnitude 0 1 mpa is considered using the mat 1 material property else stated otherwise the nonlinear deflection parameters are presented in the nondimensional form using the same formulae said previously w w h 3 6 influence of side to thickness ratio on nonlinear static bending responses of delaminated elliptical shell panel in this illustration a four layer cross ply 0 90 0 90 elliptical shell panel r a 20 with the simply supported constraint is analysed for different size of delamination under the mechanical udl and sdl type of loading the nondimensional transverse central displacements for the five different side to thickness ratios a h 10 20 30 40 and 50 is computed employing the proposed higher order models and shown in fig 12 a b it is observed from the results that the deflection parameters increased with increasing of the side to thickness ratio irrespective of the size of delamination with the increase in side to thickness ratio the thickness of the panel and overall stiffness decreases result in the deflection responses increases additionally a significant increase in nonlinear deflection parameter has also been observed with increase in the size of the deboning and the results are within the expected line 3 7 influence of curvature ratio on nonlinear bending responses of delaminated composite hyperboloid shell panel the nondimensional transverse central displacement of clamped four layer cross ply 0 90 0 90 hyperboloid shell panel with different size of internal damage subjected to sdl and udl loading is examined for five different curvature ratio r a 5 10 20 50 and 100 and presented in fig 13 a b it is evident from the figures that the nonlinear deflection parameters increased irrespective of the size of internal damage when the curvature ratio increases it is because of the well known fact that the deep shell panel has the higher bending strength as compared to shallow shell panel and in this example the same situation occur when curvature ratio increases for the constant side length further the deflection parameters are following an increasing trend when the size of internal damage at the centre mid plane increases for both the mechanical loading i e sdl and udl loading also it is worthy to mention that the debonding of the consecutive layers of the laminate reduces the overall stiffness of the structural panel and it results the increase of the deflection values 3 8 influence of aspect ratio on nonlinear bending responses of delaminated composite spherical shell panel the effect of aspect ratio on the nonlinear static responses of the simply supported symmetric cross ply 0 90 90 0 delaminated spherical shell panel r a 20 and a h 50 under udl and sdl loading is studied numerically in this example the results are calculated using both the higher order models for different aspect ratios a b 1 1 5 2 2 5 and 3 and plotted in fig 14 a b the results indicate the notable effect of the aspect ratios on the transverse central displacement i e the central displacement values decreased with the increase in aspect ratios for both types of mechanical loading udl and sdl the deflection values are higher for the udl loading in comparison to the sdl type of loading it is due to the fact that the load magnitude is uniform in case of udl throughout the panel surface whereas the load varies from zero to maximum from the boundary to the mid plane for sinusoidal loading however the effect of the size of internal damage is same as discussed in the previous example for all five aspect ratios 3 9 influence of modular ratio on nonlinear bending responses of delaminated composite cylindrical shell panel the nonlinear bending strength of the clamped symmetric cross ply 0 90 90 0 cylindrical shell panel r a 20 and a h 50 with different size of delamination at the centre mid plane of the laminated under udl and sdl loading is investigated for the five different modular ratios and shown in fig 15 a b the figures show the reduction in nonlinear transverse displacement with an increase in the modular ratios as expected for the present case it is because when the modular ratio increased the global stiffness increase which in turn decreases the transverse deflection values subsequently the figures also show the significant increase in the displacement parameter as the area of debonding increases between two consecutive layers irrespective of the loading conditions 3 10 influence of size of debonding on nonlinear bending responses of delaminated composite spherical shell panel in order to demonstrate the effect of the delamination size on the nonlinear static responses a simply supported spherical shell panel 0 90 90 0 s example is solved using the design parameters a h 50 and r a 50 under two loadings udl and sdl the responses transverse centerline deflection along length and width are evaluated for the different sizes of debonding areas fig 7 with the help of presently developed nonlinear fe models and depicted in fig 16 a d the interesting outcome reveals that the delamination size has the significant effect on the deflection parameter i e as the increase in the debonding sizes the overall structural integrity stiffness decrease which in turn increases the deflection parameter further it is important to discuss that the effect of debonding size is independent of loading 3 11 influence of delamination position on nonlinear bending responses of delaminated composites elliptical shell panel the debonding not always initiated at the centre of mid plane of the laminated structure but it may arise at any interfaces as well in a real situation so it is a matter of concern that the debonding at every interface is equally important or the emphasis has to be given for the debonding at any particular interface in order to understand such case an example of elliptical shell panel with the delamination c a 0 5 at the different interfaces is investigated under udl and sdl types of loading the detailed position of the delamination can be seen in fig 8 for the computation a clamped eight layer 0 90 0 90 s elliptical shell panel is investigated numerically by setting the thickness and curvature ratios as 50 and 20 respectively the nonlinear transverse centerline displacement along the length and the width of the elliptical shell panel are calculated and plotted in fig 17 a d the deformation characteristic is found to be maximum for the middle interface i 1 and it starts falling as the debonding moves in other interfaces i e i 2 i 3 and i 4 and it is lowest for the interface i 4 the above trend clearly indicates that the debonding at the mid plane is more significant than any other interfaces away from the mid plane 3 12 influence of location of debonded area on nonlinear bending responses of delaminated hyperboloid composite shell panel the significance of the debonding size and the position is already demonstrated in the earlier example now the effect of location of the debonding area on the nonlinear static responses of doubly curved shell panel has been illustrated in this example by shifting the debonded area into five different locations left right middle top and bottom on the mid plane of the laminated plate as shown in fig 18 the responses are computed numerically for the simply supported hyperboloid shell panel a h 50 r a 20 with rectangular a 2b delamination c a 0 25 and antisymmetric cross ply 0 90 0 90 s lay up sequences under the udl and sdl type of loading the nonlinear transverse centerline displacement along the length x a and width y b are calculated using presently developed fe models and presented in fig 19 a d the figures indicate the significant effect of the change in location of the debonding area on the nonlinear responses in addition it is interesting to note that the responses follow the same trend and equal magnitude for the left or right shift of delamination irrespective of the models and loading conditions 3 13 influence of size of debonding on in plane stress of cylindrical shell panel in this example the influence of delamination sizes on the stress is demonstrated for the analysis a simply supported cylindrical shell panel with cross ply laminations 0 90 90 0 is examined using the side to thickness and the curvature ratios as 50 and 60 respectively under two types of mechanical loading udl and sdl the stress values are computed through the thickness using both the host models and shown in fig 20 a b the responses are calculated using the mat 3 type of properties and setting the load 100 kn from the figures the increasing trend of stress values is found with the increase in delamination sizes it is worthy to discuss here that the present results calculated using the constitutive relations in this example the stresses are expressed in the nondimensional form using the formulae as σ n d σ a h 2 e ξ 2 respectively 4 conclusive remarks the nonlinear static deflections of the laminated composite shell structures are computed numerically with the help of new nonlinear mathematical model based on the higher order kinematic theories including green lagrange nonlinear strains and all the nonlinear higher order strain terms the responses are evaluated via a generic computer code prepared in matlab environment the convergence and the validation study of the proposed nonlinear numerical models have been performed by computing an adequate number of numerical examples in addition the responses are computed experimentally with the help of three point bend test on in house fabricated woven glass epoxy laminate composite plate including different sizes of the delamination in order to add more confidence as well as the superiority of the proposed numerical study the present results are compared with those of the experimental data lastly the applicability of the developed models has been explored by solving few new examples which show the influences of the material and geometrical parameter on the nonlinear static behavior of the curved shell panel on the basis of the numerical and the experimental investigation the following conclusive remarks have been put forward for the better understanding the validation studies indicate that the results of the presently developed nonlinear higher order models are in line with those of the earlier published result further the confidence on the present models has also been added by comparing the present static deflections with that of the experimental nonlinear bending responses of internally damaged glass epoxy laminate various numerical interpretations indicate the significant effect of the damage on the nonlinear static behavior i e the presence of debonding reduces the total structural deformation bearing capacity and increases the deflection responses in addition the presence of the debonding at the mid plane middle interface of the laminate is more crucial than any other interface away from the mid plane the debonding nearer to the constrained boundary does not affect the overall stiffness and static responses significantly in comparison to centrally located debonding the result indicates that the stress and the deflection parameters affected considerably due to increase in the size of internal debonding i e following an increasing trend with the increase in the size of the debonding irrespective of the type of loading 
23371,the investigation of tsunami bore force mitigation is important to new houses design around already built houses the tsunami bore is simulated by dam break wave in the 3d numerical flume built by commercial software ansys fluent the numerical model is validated by the physical experiment the tsunami in line force time history of detached house without protecting barrier is divided into four stages and the characteristics of each stage are analyzed the influencing parameters of the mitigation effect in the above four stages including α the relative clear distance between the front and rear houses and β the relative bay width of the front house are studied elaborately further the mechanism of the influence of α and β are explored results show the tsunami in line force on the rear house can be remarkably smaller even become minus or slightly larger than the case without front house when α and β changes characteristics of the reconstruction bore behind the front house including completeness of bore bore height velocity etc are responsible for the tsunami force changes on the rear house at last the chart of mitigation index varies with α and β is presented keywords tsunami bore force mitigation effect modeling onshore structure computational fluid dynamics cfd residential house 1 introduction in the beginning of the 21st century two devastating tsunamis happened and caused terrific loss of life and serious destructions to the coastal infrastructures about 200 thousand people were killed and lots of infrastructures were destroyed in the 2004 indian ocean tsunami and tens of thousands of deaths and missing was reported and many bridges residential houses and harbors especially the nuclear power station were destroyed in the 2011 japan tohoku tsunami the generation of tsunami could not be controlled by human but researches on how to optimize the structures to increase the resist ability are meaningful and practical many researchers have devoted to the tsunami forces on coastal structures i e the characteristics influence parameters and calculation methods of tsunami forces have been investigated intensively shoji and hiraki 2011 carried out hydraulic experiments to clarify a tsunami wave load on a bridge deck subjected to different breaker bores results show the averaged values of drag coefficient is 1 52 for surging breaker bores and 1 56 for plunging breaker bores hamzah et al 2001 numerically and experimentally investigated hydrodynamic pressure of a bore on a vertical barrier the bore impact on the vertical wall is identified and correlated with the incident wave kinematics the results show two types of pressure peaks impulsive pressure and followed by the standing wave pressure al faesly et al 2011 conducted physical experiment on a large scale model of onshore structure to test the pressure distribution around the model and total net forces when the model subjected to tsunami bores results show the flume bed conditions wet or dry bore water level have influence on time histories of pressure and force the bore force profile demonstrates the existence of three major components of the hydrodynamic force impact runup and quasi steady hydrodynamic and also tsunami forces on coastal houses have been widely studied thusyanthan and madabhushi 2008 studied the tsunami wave loading on coastal house compared the impact of a tsunami wave on a typical coastal house with that on a new tsunami resistant design results reveal how the tsunami wave passed through the new house design without damaging it but severely damaged the typical coastal house lindt et al 2009 studied the tsunami bore forces on a compliant residential building model the lateral displacement under each wave impact was measured in oregon state university s tsunami wave basin by using a one sixth scale building model and an experimental load deformation relationship was determined for a nominally identical one sixth scale model in the colorado state university structure laboratory robertson et al 2013 carried out a series of experiments in the large wave flume at oregon state university to quantify tsunami bore forces on structures results show the bores propagated with a froude number of approximately 2 and that the forces follow froude scaling and a design formula for the maximum impact force is presented heintz and mahoney 2008 investigated the feasibility of designing vertical evacuation structures providing refuge for tsunami inundation area the fema p 646 2008 introduced the guidelines for design of structures for vertical evacuation from tsunamis and suggested the recommendations on siting concepts performance objectives design loads and load combinations for locating and designing tsunami vertical evacuation structures the mitigation effects caused by protecting barriers in front of the coastal structures are seldom investigated crespo et al 2007 reported that the protecting barriers dikes and seawalls could mitigate the force and moment exerted on the structures in terms of the dike height and the distance from the dike to the structures wei and dalrymple 2016 used gpusph to investigate tsunami forces on bridge superstructures and tsunami mitigation on bridges by employing a service road bridge and an offshore breakwater it is found that a two girder service road bridge is effective in reducing tsunami forces on the main bridge furthermore a breakwater can also reduce tsunami force on a bridge and there is an optimal distance about eight times of the local water depth or 13 times of the incoming tsunami height between the breakwater and the bridge to achieve the best reduction effect wijatmiko and murakami 2012 used three dimension numerical simulation based on modified navier stoke equations and vof model to study the tsunami bore inundation flow around cylindrical structure surrounded by weir results indicate that the existence of protective weir significantly reduce wave velocity inside the protective weir tsunami wave often breaks nearshore then transforms into a hydraulic bore that has a uniform depth and infinite wavelength with a steep and turbulent bore front ordinarily there are two ways to generate tsunami bores in laboratory or in numerical simulation one is to generate a solitary wave by wave maker in the wave flume or in the wave basin and the solitary wave will break and transform into bores at the slope of the flume end because of the shoaling effect the tsunami bores and the resulting force on structures generated in this way has been employed by lukkunaprasit et al 2008 oshnack et al 2009 thomas and cox 2012 wang et al 2014 ghosh et al 2016 pringgana et al 2016 etc another way is to simulate tsunami bore by using dam break wave the water flume with the flat bottom is separated into two parts by a gate the upstream of the gate acts as a reservoir and the downstream acts as dry bed without initial water or wet bed with a smaller depth of water representing the structures have already been inundated before the attack by the largest tsunami bore when the gate is removed away quickly the water breaks down from the upstream then transform into bores chanson 2005 2006 showed the analogy between a tsunami induced bore and the dam break hydraulic bore and demonstrated the correctness of using dam break bore to quantify the effects of tsunami induced bores on the structures based on these points many researchers i e crespo et al 2007 douglas and nistor 2015 motley et al 2015 árnason et al 2009 triatmadja and nurhasanah 2012 rahman et al 2014 etc applied dam break bore to simulate the tsunami induced bore experimentally and numerically the method of generating tsunami bore by dam break wave is adopted in this study as the dam break wave is relatively convenient to be generated both in laboratory and in cfd compared with the generation of the solitary wave in addition the wave height cross section velocity of tsunami bore could be formulated using downstream initial water depth and upstream water depth i e the formulations presented by stoker 1957 for wet bed cases and by chanson 2005 for dry bed cases respectively vice versa by using these formulations upstream water depth and downstream initial water depth of generating a tsunami bore with designated wave height and cross section velocity could be estimated which will greatly facilitate the design of experimental scheme generally the investigation of tsunami bore force mitigation on the residential houses caused by the front houses has not been reported the mitigation effect and its influencing factors are important to build new houses around already built houses this study employs commercial software ansys fluent to investigate tsunami forces mitigation on the rear house protected by the front house and the influencing factors such as relative clear distance between the front and rear houses relative bay width of the front house are studied elaborately 2 numerical simulation method 2 1 basic equations the numerical simulations in this study employ a well established finite volume numerical code called ansys

the near wall region of structure the solution gradients are much high so the calculations in the near wall regions are critical to the precision of simulation as reynolds number is large when tsunami bores interact with structures scalable wall function is chosen to treat the boundary layer this wall function is able to avoid the deterioration of standard wall function under grid refinement when y is very small here y y μ ρ τ w where y is the distance from the wall to the center of the innermost cell and τ w is the wall shear stress μ and ρ are dynamic viscosity and density of water respectively the size of the most inner cell d s is twice of y and y is set as 60 in this study 2 2 validation of the numerical simulation method in order to validate the numerical simulation method a numerical testing flume with the same dimensions say 16 6 m long 0 6 m wide and 0 45 m deep as used in the physical experiment by árnason et al 2009 is built shown in fig 1 note that all the parameters such as dimensions of the flume dimensions and location of the circular column the downstream water depth and the impoundment behind the gate are totally the same as the physical experiment the bottom front and back walls left and right walls of the numerical testing flume are set as stationary wall boundary conditions the top of the testing flume is set as pressure outlet to allow air flow in or out of the flume the boundary of the circular column is set as stationary wall too the impoundment behind the gate is set as h 1 250 mm the downstream water depth is set as h 0 20 mm the densities of water and air are 998 2 kg m 3 and 1 225 kg m 3 respectively and the viscosities of water and air are 0 00103 kg m s and 0 000017894 kg m s respectively the gravitational acceleration g is set as 9 81 m s 2 the grid size of the computational domain is key to both calculation precision and efficiency so three grid size generation schemes namely fine mid and coarse shown in table 1 are tested comparison of water surface elevation fluid velocity time history at the monitoring point p0 11 1 0 046 0 3 between numerical simulation and the experiment are shown in fig 2 and fig 3 respectively it s observed that the mid and fine schemes are almost have the same accuracy and match better with the experimental than the coarse scheme in fig 2 however the mid scheme mostly approaches to the average position of the experiment curve and the coarse scheme show the dam break bore arrives at the circular column a little later than experimental value comparison of the horizontal in line forces on circular column are shown in fig 4 which illustrates that four curves match well and the curve of mid scheme mostly coincide with the curve of the experiment the peak values of the water surface elevations velocities at the monitoring point p0 before the circular column namely h max u max respectively and the in line forces f max on circular column are compared in table 1 comparison shows both the peak values of the mid and fine schemes are much closed to the experimental peak values however the fine scheme has much low calculation efficiency as it consumed time more than 3 times of the mid scheme taking both precision and time cost into consideration grid size used by mid scheme is adopted in the following study note that air entrapments may introduce remarkable difference between physical experiment and numerical simulation especially for the cases of structures containing open chambers as lots of airs will be entrapped in the chambers when tsunami bores flood the structures studies by seiffert et al 2016 shows the entrapped air significantly influence vertical force but has relatively little effect on horizontal forces in the direction of wave propagation the simplified models of the houses are solid boxes containing no chambers in this study only air layers but no air pockets will generate at the first contact between water and solid structure which may result in a shock wave force on the structure with a high magnitude and short duration this phenomenon has been studied by bagnold 1939 mitsuyasu 1966 and so on numerical method based on solving rans equations can well simulate the impinging force include shock wave force introduced by air layer of tsunami bore such as in reference by motley et al 2015 tsunami force on rectangular column will be studied in this study but difference of tsunami bore forces on circular column between physical experiment and numerical simulation introduced by air layer may differ from the difference on rectangular column so comparison of tsunami force on square column between numerical simulation and physical experiment was conducted and is demonstrated in fig 5 note that physical experiments on both circular and square column were conducted by árnason árnason et al 2009 the numerical simulation technique and parameters used on circular column are employed here generally two curves agree with each other quite well in fig 5 impinging forces marked with boxes differ from each other but the peak values marked with circles in the increasing stage are almost the same so peak values in the increasing stage will be used to define the mitigation index in following study comparisons demonstrate that the numerical simulation method including turbulent model wall function grid size and boundary conditions discussed above are correct and could be employed to simulate the tsunami bore and tsunami forces with confidence 3 model setup 3 1 case description low rise residential houses are widely located in china s south east coastal villages where the tsunami hazard could not be ignored wang et al 2012 the typical detached residential house with the horizontal dimensions 8 m 5 m bay width depth is chosen as the rear house and the front house share the same depth but different bay width tsunami bore is assumed to advance toward bay width in order to reduce the time cost of numerical computation the houses are scaled down by length scale 1 20 the model houses and their relative positions are shown in fig 6 in which w f and l f are bay width and depth of the front house respectively w r and l r are the bay width and depth of the rear house respectively d is the clear distance between two house our focus is on how the bay width of the front house w f and clear distance d influence the tsunami forces on the rear house so dimensions and location of the rear house keep unchanged but the bay width of the front house w f varies and the location of the front house moves closer or farther to change the clear distance d further relative clear distance is defined as α d w r and relative bay width of the front house is defined as β w f w r to denote two dimensionless parameters the cases in this study is listed in table 2 clear distance d 0 25 m 4 75 m means for each value of w f or β clear distance changes from 0 2 m to 4 75 m with interval 0 5 m correspondingly relative clear distance α changes from 0 625 to 11 875 with interval 1 25 so altogether 70 cases will be simulated 3 2 size of numerical flume the smaller ratio of structure width to flume width will lead to strong blockage effect which ultimately influence the hydrodynamic forces on the structure wei and dalrymple 2016 changed the flume width to study the blockage effect numerically results show when flume width is larger than 7 5 times of the upstream edge square cylinder approximately blockage effect could be ignored the largest bay width of the front house is 0 8 m so the minimum width of 6 0 m is required in order to minimize the blockage effect obviously the numerical flume 16 6 m long 0 6 m wide and 0 45 m deep built in section 2 2 could not be used anymore a new numerical flume with dimensions 20 m 6 m 0 5 m length width depth is built by using the same parameters in section 2 2 as shown in fig 7 3 3 basic parameters of tsunami bore generation wang et al 2012 conducted numerical simulation to estimate the potential tsunami hazard in china s south east coastal area results show the possible tsunami wave height could be 1 5 m and 2 5 m if respectively m w 9 0 and m w 9 3 megathrust earthquake happens at japan northwest offshore as a representative of possible tsunami wave height 1 8 m is chosen for the prototype wave height and correspondingly 0 09 m is chosen to be the tsunami wave height of model test generated in the numerical flume considering the length scale ratio 1 20 follow the method presented by árnason 2005 based on the shallow water wave equation and tsunami bore height the initial impoundment could be calculated out that is h 1 0 25 m tsunami is not a single wave but a series of bores and usually the second or third bore may be the largest bore which means the residential houses have already been partially submerged before the largest bore impinging on houses triatmadja and nurhasanah 2012 in this study the initial water depth h 0 0 4 0 m for real house and correspondingly h 0 0 02 m for model houses are assumed the initial impoundment h 1 and initial water depth h 0 are shown in fig 7 4 results analysis 4 1 the requirement of the relative clear distance the dam break wave might not fully develop before it arrived at the front house if the distance between the gate and the front house is too short when the relative clear distance α keeps increasing reminding that the location of the rear house keeps unchanged as α changes the un fully developed tsunami bore will introduce some uncertain interference to our study so the characteristics of the tsunami bore are validated in terms of tsunami force when it arrives at the front house in each case with different α fig 8 shows the horizontal in line force time history f x t when β 2 α changes correspondingly l g changes from 0 625 to 11 875 with interval 1 25 it could be observed that in the first 2 s after tsunami bore impacting on the front house the in line force curves match pretty well demonstrating that tsunami bores have already well developed and almost keep stable before impinging the front house but after 2 s deviations between curves are observed and those deviations mainly result from the influence of the rear house 4 2 tsunami forces on the rear house without the front house in order to demonstrate the influence of the front house on the rear house elaborately the in line force characteristics on the rear house without the protecting effect of the front house is studied firstly a monitoring point p1 14 99 0 06 3 0 locating in the centerline of the numerical flume and just 1 cm upstream of the front face of the rear house 6 cm above the flume bottom is defined to detect the time history of the water surface height h t and in line velocity u t the normalized in line force f x t f x t f x m a x on the rear house water surface elevation h t h t h m a x and in line velocity u t u t u m a x at the point p1 are depicted in fig 9 in which f x m a x h m a x and u m a x are respectively the maximum values of f x t h t and u t in terms of in line force f x t the interaction between tsunami bore and house could be divided into 4 stages detailed as 1 the impinging stage namely stage i shown in fig 9 a in this stage the tsunami bore front collides on the upstream face of the house the in line force water surface elevation and the in line velocity at p1 increase suddenly under the impingement of fast advancing bore front the flow field is illustrated in fig 10 a 2 the increasing stage namely stage ii shown in fig 9 b the tsunami bore is split into two branches flowing around the house the blockage effect makes the water surface elevation at the front face of the rear house increase rapidly but the water surface elevation of the downstream face increases gradually due to the protecting effect of the rear house shown in fig 10 b the velocity in front of the rear house decreases quickly and the difference of the hydrostatic force between the front and back faces of the rear house take the major responsibility of the in line tsunami force which increases sharply during this stage shown in fig 9 b 3 the decreasing stage namely stage iii shown in fig 9 b the run up height on the front face gradually decrease and the downstream face is gradually inundated shown in fig 10 c considering the velocity at the front of the rear house is almost unchanged so the gradually increasing water surface height at the downstream face results in a slowly decreasing resultant in line force shown in fig 9 b note that the hydrostatic forces on the front and back faces of the house are opposite 4 the quasi stable stage namely stage iv shown in fig 9 b the water surface heights at the front and back face of the rear house are almost stable shown in fig 10 d also the velocity in front of the rear house is unchangeable so the in line force in this stage is almost stable 4 3 tsunami forces on the rear house protected by the front house 4 3 1 influence of the relative clear distance α with the protection of the front house the flow field around the rear house is changed then the tsunami force acting on rear house changes accordingly both of the relative clear distance α and relative bay width β introduce prominent influences on tsunami force of the rear house here the influence of the relative clear distance α will be studied in detail the cases with relative bay width remaining unchanged e g β 2 and the relative clear distance α varing from 0 625 to 11 875 with interval 1 25 are studied the comparison of in line force time histories between cases with α 0 625 1 875 5 625 11 825 and the case without front house is shown in fig 11 the influences introduced by the front house could be concluded in five points approximately detailed as 1 the time of tsunami bore arriving at the rear house is delayed and the larger the relative clear distance α the longer of the delayed time the protecting effect of the front house slows tsunami bore and delays the impingement of the tsunami on the rear house 2 in the impinging stage generally the peak value of impact force increases with the increase of α and if α is so small that the reconstruction of the tsunami bore has not completed no obvious peak values are observed for example α 0 625 shown in fig the peak values in this stage are smaller than that of the case without front house except of the case with α 11 875 and increase with α generally shown in fig 12 3 in the increasing stage the peak value increases with the increase of α generally and the peak value is slightly larger than the case without front house when α is large i e α 11 875 5 625 and are much smaller than the case without front house when α is small i e α 1 875 0 625 4 in the quasi stable stage the average in line force is smaller than without front house and increases with the increase of α the average in line force may become minus namely pointing to upstream when α is smaller i e α 0 625 5 the mitigation effect is improved as α decreases in terms of impulse on the rear house which equal to the product of time and force decreases as the decrease of α because of the obvious shortening of the duration of main tsunami force and decrease of the average main tsunami force when α decreases generally the tsunami force on the rear house changes violently when protected by the front house the mechanism of the tsunami force changes with α is explored further the relative clear distance α determines the gap between the front house and the rear house which provide a distance for the development of the reconstruction of the split bore when blocked by the front house when impinging on the front house the tsunami bore is split into two branches flowing around the front house and approaching toward the middle line of the flume note that the two front ends of the branches advance with larger in line velocity components and a pair of opposite crosswise z axis direction velocities namely positive w and negative w for left and right branches facing the downstream respectively when α is large enough i e α 11 875 or α 5 625 the distance between the two houses is large enough to allow the two branches join together namely flow reconstruction completes shown in fig 13 b in the confluence process two branches collide with each other in the centerline of the flume which diminishes the crosswise velocity w and results in a relative larger bore height than the case without front house shown by comparison between fig 13 a and fig 13 b also shown in fig 14 which ultimately introduces larger peak values in the impinging stage and increasing stage shown in fig 11 due to the protecting effect of the front house the water surface height behind the reconstructed bore i e the water surface height after t 6 5s decreases rapidly shown in fig 14 that s the main reason why tsunami force is smaller than that without front house in the decreasing and quasi stable stages however when α is small i e α 0 625 most part of the split branches will flow around the rear house as there is no enough distance for the two branches approaching to the centerline bore reconstruction is not completed shown in fig 13 c so few or no water will impinge on the front face of the rear house then the peak value of impact force decreases or disappears in the impinging stage shown in fig 11 and the minus in line force is observed in the quasi stable stage as the water surface height at the back face is larger than that at the front face just as shown in fig 15 in order to shed light on flow field between the front and rear houses a vertical plane at the centerline of the flume between the two houses is set as view plane to display the evolution of water surface height shown in fig 16 a the time histories of water surface profile of cases with different α are shown in fig 16 b c d and e when α is small the water surface height is close to initial downstream water depth 0 02 m and it increases slightly around t 7s but no run up at the upstream face of the rear house x 15 m is observed because the split branches bypass the rear house before joining to reconstruct bore as the distance between the two houses is too small for small α case with the increase of α the water surface height increases and run up of the bore comes into being run up height increases firstly comparing fig 16 c and d then decreases comparing fig 16 d and e which also can be observed in fig 14 the peak values in the increasing stage compared with the case without front house the flow rate between the two houses decreases because a part of water has been blocked in front of the front house and a part of the two split branch water hasn t flow toward the centerline of the flume to reconstruct bores directly bypassing the rear house the smaller α the more water bypassing the rear house and the lower flow rate soon after the occurrence of run up run up declines quickly for smaller α cases as flow rate is extremely lower and for larger α cases overturn of run up occurs and the collapsed run up moves upstream but encountered with the downstream advancing flows then pushed back and upraised in front of the rear house namely bow wave forms which can be observed clearly in fig 16 e however compared with the case without front house the height of the bow wave is smaller due to the low flow rate so a sharp decrease of the water surface height and tsunami force after t 6 5s in fig 14 and fig 11 respectively could be observed in the decreasing stage as hydrostatic dominates in this stage froude number f r u g h at the position of the rear house which has been removed away is investigated in which u is the in line flow velocity h is the water surface height and g is the gravitational acceleration 7 monitoring points n 1 n 7 are set at the effective influencing width which is the bore width assumed to obviously influence the bore force on the rear house is defined 3 time of the rear house width in this study to the rear house shown in fig 17 to investigate f r distribution along the cross section of the flume z direction the f r time history of 4 out of 7 the left are omitted because of symmetry monitoring points are compared with the case without houses in which dam break bore can flow freely without any interference with structures shown in fig 17 what can be observed is that f r of all monitoring points have peak values greater than 1 the peak value of n 1 is mostly closed to that of case without houses as the flow field far from the centerline of flume is weakly influenced by the blockage of the front house both the bore front of the case without houses and reconstructed bore front are supercritical then a quasi stable period after t 6 5s approximately with f r values around 1 but lightly smaller than the case without houses is observed which indicates the supercritical flow behind the bore front is easily affected by the front house and changed into subcritical the influence of front house is more obvious at the centerline positions i e n 4 then increments of f r are observed after t 9s approximately except of the case without houses this is caused by the increasing of velocity and decreasing of water surface height at the monitoring points generally positions closed to the centerline of flume are more affected by the front house and have smaller f r values in the following text f r of the effective influencing width will be derived by averaging the velocities of the seven monitoring points f r time histories comparison of the effective influencing width of the cases with different α is shown in fig 18 it can be observed that f r is larger than 1 in bore front and gradually become less than 1 behind the bore front for lager α cases i e 11 875 and 5 625 indicating that the reconstructed bore front is supercritical for lager α cases but the flow behind the bore front gradually changes into subcritical for smaller α cases f r is less than 1 and even becomes minus i e 1 875 and 0 625 indicating the reconstructed bore is subcritical for smaller α cases minus f r means minus velocity implying the reconstructed bore don t approaches forward but flows backward to the downstream face of the front house as there is no water at the beginning of the split branch flowing around the front house however if α is larger the monitoring points are out of the backflow area no minus velocity will be measured and then f r is positive 4 3 2 influence of relative bay width β the influence of β is discussed based on the cases with relative clear distance α 5 625 unchanged and β changes from 0 5 to 2 0 with the interval 0 25 the comparison shown in fig 19 indicates the differences of in line force time histories induced by changes of β generally five differences are concluded as follows 1 the impinging occurs later with the increase of β 2 in the impinging stage the impingement force peak values are smaller than the case without front house and decrease with the increase of the β shown in fig 19 a 3 in the increasing stage the peak value increases with the increase of β when β 2 the peak values is smaller than that of without front house case but is a little larger than without front house case when β 2 4 in the quasi stable stage the average in line force is smaller than the case without front house and decreases with the increase of β 5 the mitigation effect is improved as β increases the impulse on the rear house decreases as the increase of β because of the shortening of the duration of main tsunami force and decrease of the average main tsunami force when β increases just as stated in section 4 3 1 the confluence of the two split branches may generate a relative larger bore height than the case without front house which result in a larger peak value than the case without front house i e β 2 in fig 19 b and the crosswise z axis direction velocities of the branches increase with the increase of β and the collision between two branches become more violent which makes the reconstructed bore height increase shown in fig 20 also the larger β allows a longer approaching time before two branches meet in the centerline which leads to the location of reconstruction bore further from the front house in other words nearer to the rear house then the decrease of the bore height during the propagation process will be smaller for larger β cases so larger β larger bore height and smaller decrease of the bore height generating lager peak value in the increasing stage i e β 2 0 1 5 shown in fig 19 b compared with the case with larger β i e β 2 the tsunami wave in the cases with smaller β i e β 0 5 can flow around the front house more easily and quickly the bulk of blocked water is smaller and its run up is smaller too in front of the front house shown in fig 21 in other words in smaller β case the bulk of water behind the front house is larger and the in line velocity of which is larger which results in a relatively larger average in line force and longer duration namely weaker protection effect than the cases with larger β shown in fig 19 b fig 22 shows the evolution of water surface at the view plane same as the view plane defined in fig 16 a of different β the run up height of β 2 is a little higher than β 0 5 which results in a larger bore forces at increasing stage however at the quasi stable stage for example at t 8s the water surface height of β 2 is smaller than that of β 0 5 which leads to a smaller force in the quasi stable stage shown in fig 19 fig 23 shows the comparison of evolution of water surface of cases with different β at the view plane the flow behind the front house reconstructed and propagated its water surface height increased with time or x coordinate firstly then decreased during the propagation process the positions x coordinate of maximum water surface height of different β are marked in fig 23 they are x 14 20 m 14 02 m 13 79 m and 13 83 m when β 2 1 5 1 and 0 5 respectively the positions agree with the previous analysis that larger β allows a longer approaching time before two branches meet in the centerline which leads to the location of reconstruction bore further from the front house the maximum height of reconstructed bore increases with β approximately which is consistent with the water surface height in fig 16 f r time histories of the effective influencing width at different β when 3 125 is shown in fig 24 what can be observed is that values of f r increase with the decrease of β the bore front is supercritical but the flow behind the bore is subcritical generally compared with the case without houses shown in fig 18 values of f r at reconstructed bore front increase lightly for larger α or smaller β cases but decrease obviously for smaller α and larger β cases bore front is supercritical for larger α cases values of f r of flow behind bore fronts are less than the case without front houses and normally less than 1 indicating the flow changing into subcritical because of blockage of the front house according to árnason et al 2009 when f r 1 energy loss in the bore can become significant so energy loss in the reconstructed bore is relatively smaller compared with the case without houses as blockage of front house dissipate a part of energy in other words the front house plays a protective role 4 4 estimation of the mitigating effect as air layer might affect the calculation precision of peak values in the impinging stage shown in fig 5 peak values on the rear house in the increasing stage namely f 0 m a x and f m a x for the cases without and with front house respectively are used to define mitigation index η f 0 m a x f m a x f 0 m a x to describe the mitigation effect it can be observed in fig 25 a that η decreases sharply with α when α 5 625 indicating the front house has an obvious protecting effect on mitigating the peak force of tsunami force on the rear house when α 5 625 η almost keeps stable and decreases to zero i e β 0 75 or is less than zero i e β 0 75 indicating the front house has almost no protecting effect or even increases the peak value of tsunami force on the rear house it can be observed in fig 25 b that when α 4 375 η increases with relative bay width β indicating the protecting effect increases with the enlargement of the relative bay width however when α 4 375 η decreases with β and η is less than zero for larger β indicating the front house almost has no protecting effect on reducing the peak value of the tsunami force on the rear house or even worth introducing a larger peak value note that above conclusion is obtained based on the peak value of the increasing stage however the protection effect is improved with the increase of β and decrease of α because of shortening of the duration of main tsunami force and decrease of the average main tsunami force just as stated in sections 4 3 1 and 4 3 2 5 conclusions mitigation of tsunami bore force on the typical detached residential houses located in china s south east coastal village is numerically investigated in this study 3d numerical dam break wave is used to simulate tsunami bore in the 3d numerical flume by ansys fluent the numerical method including grid size boundary conditions turbulence model etc is validated by comparisons of tsunami bore height velocity and in line force on cylinder with those of the physical experiment by árnason et al 2009 the time history of the tsunami in line force on the detached house without protection of the front house is divided into four stages i e the impinging stage increasing stage decreasing stage and quasi stable stage and the characteristics of each stage are analyzed then the influence of relative clear distance α and relative bay width β on the above four stages are discussed elaborately and summarized as 1 the arriving time of the tsunami bore is delayed by the front house the larger α the longer the delayed time the larger β the longer the delayed time 2 in the impinging stage the peak value of the impact force is smaller than the case without front house except for the cases with larger α i e α 11 875 and increases with the increase of α decreases with the increase of β 3 in the increasing stage the peak value can be slightly larger than the case without front house for the cases with larger α i e α 11 875 5 625 or larger β i e β 2 the peak value increases with the increase of α and also increases with the increase of β when α is large enough i e α 5 625 4 in the quasi stable stage the average in line force is smaller than the case without front house and increases with the increase of α decreases with the increase of β 5 the mitigation effect improves as α decreases and improves as β increases also the mechanisms of the influence of α and β on the tsunami force are explored and results show 1 if the gap between the front and rear houses is large enough for the reconstruction of the tsunami bore the peak values of the impinging stage and increasing stage may be larger than those of the without front house case respectively because of the increased bore height generated during the confluence process of the two branches 2 the larger water depth at the downstream face relative to the upstream face of the rear house which resulted from the un fully developed reconstructed bore is mainly responsible for the minus in line force namely the force pointing to upstream 3 when α is large i e α 9 375 the larger β provides a longer crosswise distance for the two branches to approach to the centerline of the flume which makes the two branches generate larger crosswise velocities and collide more violently then generates a larger reconstruction bore height at a location closer to the rear house which ultimately produces a larger peak value in the increasing stage 4 the larger β the smaller bulk of the water impacts on the rear house and lower runup in front of the rear house which results a smaller average in line force in the quasi stable stage at last the chart of mitigation index η varies with α and β is presented which is beneficial to plan the new residential house and meaningful for further study acknowledgements this work is supported by the national natural science

23371,the investigation of tsunami bore force mitigation is important to new houses design around already built houses the tsunami bore is simulated by dam break wave in the 3d numerical flume built by commercial software ansys fluent the numerical model is validated by the physical experiment the tsunami in line force time history of detached house without protecting barrier is divided into four stages and the characteristics of each stage are analyzed the influencing parameters of the mitigation effect in the above four stages including α the relative clear distance between the front and rear houses and β the relative bay width of the front house are studied elaborately further the mechanism of the influence of α and β are explored results show the tsunami in line force on the rear house can be remarkably smaller even become minus or slightly larger than the case without front house when α and β changes characteristics of the reconstruction bore behind the front house including completeness of bore bore height velocity etc are responsible for the tsunami force changes on the rear house at last the chart of mitigation index varies with α and β is presented keywords tsunami bore force mitigation effect modeling onshore structure computational fluid dynamics cfd residential house 1 introduction in the beginning of the 21st century two devastating tsunamis happened and caused terrific loss of life and serious destructions to the coastal infrastructures about 200 thousand people were killed and lots of infrastructures were destroyed in the 2004 indian ocean tsunami and tens of thousands of deaths and missing was reported and many bridges residential houses and harbors especially the nuclear power station were destroyed in the 2011 japan tohoku tsunami the generation of tsunami could not be controlled by human but researches on how to optimize the structures to increase the resist ability are meaningful and practical many researchers have devoted to the tsunami forces on coastal structures i e the characteristics influence parameters and calculation methods of tsunami forces have been investigated intensively shoji and hiraki 2011 carried out hydraulic experiments to clarify a tsunami wave load on a bridge deck subjected to different breaker bores results show the averaged values of drag coefficient is 1 52 for surging breaker bores and 1 56 for plunging breaker bores hamzah et al 2001 numerically and experimentally investigated hydrodynamic pressure of a bore on a vertical barrier the bore impact on the vertical wall is identified and correlated with the incident wave kinematics the results show two types of pressure peaks impulsive pressure and followed by the standing wave pressure al faesly et al 2011 conducted physical experiment on a large scale model of onshore structure to test the pressure distribution around the model and total net forces when the model subjected to tsunami bores results show the flume bed

severely damaged the typical coastal house lindt et al 2009 studied the tsunami bore forces on a compliant residential building model the lateral displacement under each wave impact was measured in

vertical evacuation structures the mitigation effects caused by protecting barriers in front of the coastal structures are seldom investigated crespo et al 2007 reported that the protecting barriers dikes and seawalls could mitigate the force and moment exerted on the structures in terms of the dike height and the distance from the dike to the structures wei and dalrymple 2016 used gpusph to investigate tsunami forces on bridge superstructures and tsunami mitigation on bridges by employing a service road bridge and an offshore breakwater it is found that a two girder service road bridge is effective in reducing tsunami forces on the main bridge furthermore a breakwater can also reduce tsunami force on a bridge and there is an optimal distance about eight times of the local water depth or 13 times of the incoming tsunami height between the breakwater and the bridge to achieve the best reduction effect wijatmiko and murakami 2012 used three dimension numerical simulation based on modified navier stoke equations and vof model to study the tsunami bore inundation flow around cylindrical structure surrounded by weir results indicate that the existence of protective weir significantly reduce wave velocity inside the protective weir tsunami wave often breaks nearshore then transforms into a hydraulic bore that has a uniform depth and infinite wavelength with a steep and turbulent bore front ordinarily there are two ways to generate tsunami bores in laboratory or in numerical simulation one is to generate a solitary wave by wave maker in the wave flume or in the wave basin and the solitary wave will break and transform into bores at the slope of the flume end because of the shoaling effect the tsunami bores and the resulting force on structures generated in this way has been employed by lukkunaprasit et al 2008 oshnack et al 2009 thomas and cox 2012 wang et al 2014 ghosh et al 2016 pringgana et al 2016 etc another way is to simulate tsunami bore by using dam break wave the water flume with the flat bottom is separated into two parts by a gate the upstream of the gate acts as a reservoir and the downstream acts as dry bed without initial water or wet bed with a smaller depth of water representing the structures have already been inundated before the attack by the largest tsunami bore when the gate is removed away quickly the water breaks down from the upstream then transform into bores chanson 2005 2006 showed the analogy between a tsunami induced bore and the dam break hydraulic bore and demonstrated the correctness of using dam break bore to quantify the effects of tsunami induced bores on the structures based on these points many researchers i e crespo et al 2007 douglas and nistor 2015 motley et al 2015 árnason et al 2009 triatmadja and nurhasanah 2012 rahman et al 2014 etc applied dam break bore to simulate the tsunami induced bore experimentally and numerically the method of generating tsunami bore by dam break wave is adopted in this study as the dam break wave is relatively convenient to be generated both in laboratory and in cfd compared with the generation of the solitary wave in addition the wave height cross section velocity of tsunami bore could be formulated using downstream initial water depth and upstream water depth i e the formulations presented by stoker 1957 for wet bed cases and by chanson 2005 for dry bed cases respectively vice versa by using these formulations upstream water depth and downstream initial water depth of generating a tsunami bore with designated wave height and cross section velocity could be estimated which will greatly facilitate the design of experimental scheme generally the investigation of tsunami bore force mitigation on the residential houses caused by the front houses has not been reported the mitigation effect and its influencing factors are important to build new houses around already built houses this study employs commercial software ansys fluent to investigate tsunami forces mitigation on the rear house protected by the front house and the influencing factors such as relative clear distance between the front and rear houses relative bay width of the front house are studied elaborately 2 numerical simulation method 2 1 basic equations the numerical simulations in this study employ a well established finite volume numerical code called ansys fluent to calculate all the cases the numerical code fluent solves the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations in which the conservation of mass and the conservation of momentum are respectively 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i μ ρ 2 u i x j x j 1 ρ ρ u i u j x j where u i is the time averaged velocity in which the indices i and j represents the directions of the coordinates x y z note that this index based notation implies the sum over a repeated index in terms involving multiple indices the time averaged velocity can be defined as u i 1 δ t t 0 t 0 δ t u i d t where the flow velocity can be decomposed to u i u i u i u i is the velocity fluctuation p is the time average pressure ρ is the density of water and μ is the dynamic viscosity the computational domain consists of water and air and vof method is employed to trace the water surface height as the dam break bores will deform and break intensively during their generation and advancing process especially when interacting with structures so rng k ε turbulent model is chosen the turbulence kinetic energy k and its rate of dissipation ε are calculated from the following equations 3 ρ k t ρ k u i x i x j α k μ e f f k x j g k ρ ε 4 ρ ε t ρ ε u i x i x j α k μ e f f ε x j c 1 ε ε k g k c 2 ε ρ ε 2 k in which g k ρ u i u j u j x i μ t ρ c μ k 2 ε the constants c μ 0 0845 c 1ε 1 42 c 2ε 1 68 in the near wall region of structure the solution gradients are much high so the calculations in the near wall regions are critical to the precision of simulation as reynolds number is large when tsunami bores interact with structures scalable wall function is chosen to treat the boundary layer this wall function is able to avoid the deterioration of standard wall function under grid refinement when y is very small here y y μ ρ τ w where y is the distance from the wall to the center of the innermost cell and τ w is the wall shear stress μ and ρ are dynamic viscosity and density of water respectively the size of the most inner cell d s is twice of y and y is set as 60 in this study 2 2 validation of the numerical simulation method in order to validate the numerical simulation method a numerical testing flume with the same dimensions say 16 6 m long 0 6 m wide and 0 45 m deep as used in the physical experiment by árnason et al 2009 is built shown in fig 1 note that all the parameters such as dimensions of the flume dimensions and location of the circular column the downstream water depth and the impoundment behind the gate are totally the same as the physical experiment the bottom front and back walls left and right walls of the numerical testing flume are set as stationary wall boundary conditions the top of the testing flume is set as pressure outlet to allow air flow in or out of the flume the boundary of the circular column is set as stationary wall too the impoundment behind the gate is set as h 1 250 mm the downstream water depth is set as h 0 20 mm the densities of water and air are 998 2 kg m 3 and 1 225 kg m 3 respectively and the viscosities of water and air are 0 00103 kg m s and 0 000017894 kg m s respectively the gravitational acceleration g is set as 9 81 m s 2 the grid size of the computational domain is key to both calculation precision and efficiency so three grid size generation schemes namely fine mid and coarse shown in table 1 are tested comparison of water surface elevation fluid velocity time history at the monitoring point p0 11 1 0 046 0 3 between numerical simulation and the experiment are shown in fig 2 and fig 3 respectively it s observed that the mid and fine schemes are almost have the same accuracy and match better with the experimental than the coarse scheme in fig 2 however the mid scheme mostly approaches to the average position of the experiment curve and the coarse scheme show the dam break bore arrives at the circular column a little later than experimental value comparison of the horizontal in line forces on circular column are shown in fig 4 which illustrates that four curves match well and the curve of mid scheme mostly coincide with the curve of the experiment the peak values of the water surface elevations velocities at the monitoring point p0 before the circular column namely h max u max respectively and the in line forces f max on circular column are compared in table 1 comparison shows both the peak values of the mid and fine schemes are much closed to the experimental peak values however the fine scheme has much low calculation efficiency as it consumed time more than 3 times of the mid scheme taking both precision and time cost into consideration grid size used by mid scheme is adopted in the following study note that air entrapments may introduce remarkable difference between physical experiment and numerical simulation especially for the cases of structures containing open chambers as lots of airs will be entrapped in the chambers when tsunami bores flood the structures studies by seiffert et al 2016 shows the entrapped air significantly influence vertical force but has relatively little effect on horizontal forces in the direction of wave propagation the simplified models of the houses are solid boxes containing no chambers in this study only air layers but no air pockets will generate at the first contact between water and solid structure which may result in a shock wave force on the structure with a high magnitude and short duration this phenomenon has been studied by bagnold 1939 mitsuyasu 1966 and so on numerical method based on solving rans equations can well simulate the impinging force include shock wave force introduced by air layer of tsunami bore such as in reference by motley et al 2015 tsunami force on rectangular column will be studied in this study but difference of tsunami bore forces on circular column between physical experiment and numerical simulation introduced by air layer may differ from the difference on rectangular column so comparison of tsunami force on square column between numerical simulation and physical experiment was conducted and is demonstrated in fig 5 note that physical experiments on both circular and square column were conducted by árnason árnason et al 2009 the numerical simulation technique and parameters used on circular column are employed here generally two curves agree with each other quite well in fig 5 impinging forces marked with boxes differ from each other but the peak values marked with circles in the increasing stage are almost the same so peak values in the increasing stage will be used to define the mitigation index in following study comparisons demonstrate that the numerical simulation method including turbulent model wall function grid size and boundary conditions discussed above are correct and could be employed to simulate the tsunami bore and tsunami forces with confidence 3 model setup 3 1 case description low rise residential houses are widely located in china s south east coastal villages where the tsunami hazard could not be ignored wang et al 2012 the typical detached residential house with the horizontal dimensions 8 m 5 m bay width depth is chosen as the rear house and the front house share the same depth but different bay width tsunami bore is assumed to advance toward bay width in order to reduce the time cost of numerical computation the houses are scaled down by length scale 1 20 the model houses and their relative positions are shown in fig 6 in which w f and l f are bay width and depth of the front house respectively w r and l r are the bay width and depth of the rear house respectively d is the clear distance between two house our focus is on how the bay width of the front house w f and clear distance d influence the tsunami forces on the rear house so dimensions and location of the rear house keep unchanged but the bay width of the front house w f varies and the location of the front house moves closer or farther to change the clear distance d further relative clear distance is defined as α d w r and relative bay width of the front house is defined as β w f w r to denote two dimensionless parameters the cases in this study is listed in table 2 clear distance d 0 25 m 4 75 m means for each value of w f or β clear distance changes from 0 2 m to 4 75 m with interval 0 5 m correspondingly relative clear distance α changes from 0 625 to 11 875 with interval 1 25 so altogether 70 cases will be simulated 3 2 size of numerical flume the smaller ratio of structure width to flume width will lead to strong blockage effect which ultimately influence the hydrodynamic forces on the structure wei and dalrymple 2016 changed the flume width to study the blockage effect numerically results show when flume width is larger than 7 5 times of the upstream edge square cylinder approximately blockage effect could be ignored the largest bay width of the front house is 0 8 m so the minimum width of 6 0 m is required in order to minimize the blockage effect obviously the numerical flume 16 6 m long 0 6 m wide and 0 45 m deep built in section 2 2 could not be used anymore a new numerical flume with dimensions 20 m 6 m 0 5 m length width depth is built by using the same parameters in section 2 2 as shown in fig 7 3 3 basic parameters of tsunami bore generation wang et al 2012 conducted numerical simulation to estimate the potential tsunami hazard in china s south east coastal area results show the possible tsunami wave height could be 1 5 m and 2 5 m if respectively m w 9 0 and m w 9 3 megathrust earthquake happens at japan northwest offshore as a representative of possible tsunami wave height 1 8 m is chosen for the prototype wave height and correspondingly 0 09 m is chosen to be the tsunami wave height of model test generated in the numerical flume considering the length scale ratio 1 20 follow the method presented by árnason 2005 based on the shallow water wave equation and tsunami bore height the initial impoundment could be calculated out that is h 1 0 25 m tsunami is not a single wave but a series of bores and usually the second or third bore may be the largest bore which means the residential houses have already been partially submerged before the largest bore impinging on houses triatmadja and nurhasanah 2012 in this study the initial water depth h 0 0 4 0 m for real house and correspondingly h 0 0 02 m for model houses are assumed the initial impoundment h 1 and initial water depth h 0 are shown in fig 7 4 results analysis 4 1 the requirement of the relative clear distance the dam break wave might not fully develop before it arrived at the front house if the distance between the gate and the front house is too short when the relative clear distance α keeps increasing reminding that the location of the rear house keeps unchanged as α changes the un fully developed tsunami bore will introduce some uncertain interference to our study so the characteristics of the tsunami bore are validated in terms of tsunami force when it arrives at the front house in each case with different α fig 8 shows the horizontal in line force time history f x t when β 2 α changes correspondingly l g changes from 0 625 to 11 875 with interval 1 25 it could be observed that in the first 2 s after tsunami bore impacting on the front house the in line force curves match pretty well demonstrating that tsunami bores have already well developed and almost keep stable before impinging the front house but after 2 s deviations between curves are observed and those deviations mainly result from the influence of the rear house 4 2 tsunami forces on the rear house without the front house in order to demonstrate the influence of the front house on the rear house elaborately the in line force characteristics on the rear house without the protecting effect of the front house is studied firstly a monitoring point p1 14 99 0 06 3 0 locating in the centerline of the numerical flume and just 1 cm upstream of the front face of the rear house 6 cm above the flume bottom is defined to detect the time history of the water surface height h t and in line velocity u t the normalized in line force f x t f x t f x m a x on the rear house water surface elevation h t h t h m a x and in line velocity u t u t u m a x at the point p1 are depicted in fig 9 in which f x m a x h m a x and u m a x are respectively the maximum values of f x t h t and u t in terms of in line force f x t the interaction between tsunami bore and house could be divided into 4 stages detailed as 1 the impinging stage namely stage i shown in fig 9 a in this stage the tsunami bore front collides on the upstream face of the house the in line force water surface elevation and the in line velocity at p1 increase suddenly under the impingement of fast advancing bore front the flow field is illustrated in fig 10 a 2 the increasing stage namely stage ii shown in fig 9 b the tsunami bore is split into two branches flowing around the house the blockage effect makes the water surface elevation at the front face of the rear house increase rapidly but the water surface elevation of the downstream face increases gradually due to the protecting effect of the rear house shown in fig 10 b the velocity in front of the rear house decreases quickly and the difference of the hydrostatic force between the front and back faces of the rear house take the major responsibility of the in line tsunami force which increases sharply during this stage shown in fig 9 b 3 the decreasing stage namely stage iii shown in fig 9 b the run up height on the front face gradually decrease and the downstream face is gradually inundated shown in fig 10 c considering the velocity at the front of the rear house is almost unchanged so the gradually increasing water surface height at the downstream face results in a slowly decreasing resultant in line force shown in fig 9 b note that the hydrostatic forces on the front and back faces of the house are opposite 4 the quasi stable stage namely stage iv shown in fig 9 b the water surface heights at the front and back face of the rear house are almost stable shown in fig 10 d also the velocity in front of the rear house is unchangeable so the in line force in this stage is almost stable 4 3 tsunami forces on the rear house protected by the front house 4 3 1 influence of the relative clear distance α with the protection of the front house the flow field around the rear house is changed then the tsunami force acting on rear house changes accordingly both of the relative clear distance α and relative bay width β introduce prominent influences on tsunami force of the rear house here the influence of the relative clear distance α will be studied in detail the cases with relative bay width remaining unchanged e g β 2 and the relative clear distance α varing from 0 625 to 11 875 with interval 1 25 are studied the comparison of in line force time histories between cases with α 0 625 1 875 5 625 11 825 and the case without front house is shown in fig 11 the influences introduced by the front house could be concluded in five points approximately detailed as 1 the time of tsunami bore arriving at the rear house is delayed and the larger the relative clear distance α the longer of the delayed time the protecting effect of the front house slows tsunami bore and delays the impingement of the tsunami on the rear house 2 in the impinging stage generally the peak value of impact force increases with the increase of α and if α is so small that the reconstruction of the tsunami bore has not completed no obvious peak values are observed for example α 0 625 shown in fig the peak values in this stage are smaller than that of the case without front house except of the case with α 11 875 and increase with α generally shown in fig 12 3 in the increasing stage the peak value increases with the increase of α generally and the peak value is slightly larger than the case without front house when α is large i e α 11 875 5 625 and are much smaller than the case without front house when α is small i e α 1 875 0 625 4 in the quasi stable stage the average in line force is smaller than without front house and increases with the increase of α the average in line force may become minus namely pointing to upstream when α is smaller i e α 0 625 5 the mitigation effect is improved as α decreases in terms of impulse on the rear house which equal to the product of time and force decreases as the decrease of α because of the obvious shortening of the duration of main tsunami force and decrease of the average main tsunami force when α decreases generally the tsunami force on the rear house changes violently when protected by the front house the mechanism of the tsunami force changes with α is explored further the relative clear distance α determines the gap between the front house and the rear house which provide a distance for the development of the reconstruction of the split bore when blocked by the front house when impinging on the front house the tsunami bore is split into two branches flowing around the front house and approaching toward the middle line of the flume note that the two front ends of the branches advance with larger in line velocity components and a pair of opposite crosswise z axis direction velocities namely positive w and negative w for left and right branches facing the downstream respectively when α is large enough i e α 11 875 or α 5 625 the distance between the two houses is large enough to allow the two branches join together namely flow reconstruction completes shown in fig 13 b in the confluence process two branches collide with each other in the centerline of the flume which diminishes the crosswise velocity w and results in a relative larger bore height than the case without front house shown by comparison between fig 13 a and fig 13 b also shown in fig 14 which ultimately introduces larger peak values in the impinging stage and increasing stage shown in fig 11 due to the protecting effect of the front house the water surface height behind the reconstructed bore i e the water surface height after t 6 5s decreases rapidly shown in fig 14 that s the main reason why tsunami force is smaller than that without front house in the decreasing and quasi stable stages however when α is small i e α 0 625 most part of the split branches will flow around the rear house as there is no enough distance for the two branches approaching to the centerline bore reconstruction is not completed shown in fig 13 c so few or no water will impinge on the front face of the rear house then the peak value of impact force decreases or disappears in the impinging stage shown in fig 11 and the minus in line force is observed in the quasi stable stage as the water surface height at the back face is larger than that at the front face just as shown in fig 15 in order to shed light on flow field between the front and rear houses a vertical plane at the centerline of the flume between the two houses is set as view plane to display the evolution of water surface height shown in fig 16 a the time histories of water surface profile of cases with different α are shown in fig 16 b c d and e when α is small the water surface height is close to initial downstream water depth 0 02 m and it increases slightly around t 7s but no run up at the upstream face of the rear house x 15 m is observed because the split branches bypass the rear house before joining to reconstruct bore as the distance between the two houses is too small for small α case with the increase of α the water surface height increases and run up of the bore comes into being run up height increases firstly comparing fig 16 c and d then decreases comparing fig 16 d and e which also can be observed in fig 14 the peak values in the increasing stage compared with the case without front house the flow rate between the two houses decreases because a part of water has been blocked in front of the front house and a part of the two split branch water hasn t flow toward the centerline of the flume to reconstruct bores directly bypassing the rear house the smaller α the more water bypassing the rear house and the lower flow rate soon after the occurrence of run up run up declines quickly for smaller α cases as flow rate is extremely lower and for larger α cases overturn of run up occurs and the collapsed run up moves upstream but encountered with the downstream advancing flows then pushed back and upraised in front of the rear house namely bow wave forms which can be observed clearly in fig 16 e however compared with the case without front house the height of the bow wave is smaller due to the low flow rate so a sharp decrease of the water surface height and tsunami force after t 6 5s in fig 14 and fig 11 respectively could be observed in the decreasing stage as hydrostatic dominates in this stage froude number f r u g h at the position of the rear house which has been removed away is investigated in which u is the in line flow velocity h is the water surface height and g is the gravitational acceleration 7 monitoring points n 1 n 7 are set at the effective influencing width which is the bore width assumed to obviously influence the bore force on the rear house is defined 3 time of the rear house width in this study to the rear house shown in fig 17 to investigate f r distribution along the cross section of the flume z direction the f r time history of 4 out of 7 the left are omitted because of symmetry monitoring points are compared with the case without houses in which dam break bore can flow freely without any interference with structures shown in fig 17 what can be observed is that f r of all monitoring points have peak values greater than 1 the peak value of n 1 is mostly closed to that of case without houses as the flow field far from the centerline of flume is weakly influenced by the blockage of the front house both the bore front of the case without houses and reconstructed bore front are supercritical then a quasi stable period after t 6 5s approximately with f r values around 1 but lightly smaller than the case without houses is observed which indicates the supercritical flow behind the bore front is easily affected by the front house and changed into subcritical the influence of front house is more obvious at the centerline positions i e n 4 then increments of f r are observed after t 9s approximately except of the case without houses this is caused by the increasing of velocity and decreasing of water surface height at the monitoring points generally positions closed to the centerline of flume are more affected by the front house and have smaller f r values in the following text f r of the effective influencing width will be derived by averaging the velocities of the seven monitoring points f r time histories comparison of the effective influencing width of the cases with different α is shown in fig 18 it can be observed that f r is larger than 1 in bore front and gradually become less than 1 behind the bore front for lager α cases i e 11 875 and 5 625 indicating that the reconstructed bore front is supercritical for lager α cases but the flow behind the bore front gradually changes into subcritical for smaller α cases f r is less than 1 and even becomes minus i e 1 875 and 0 625 indicating the reconstructed bore is subcritical for smaller α cases minus f r means minus velocity implying the reconstructed bore don t approaches forward but flows backward to the downstream face of the front house as there is no water at the beginning of the split branch flowing around the front house however if α is larger the monitoring points are out of the backflow area no minus velocity will be measured and then f r is positive 4 3 2 influence of relative bay width β the influence of β is discussed based on the cases with relative clear distance α 5 625 unchanged and β changes from 0 5 to 2 0 with the interval 0 25 the comparison shown in fig 19 indicates the differences of in line force time histories induced by changes of β generally five differences are concluded as follows 1 the impinging occurs later with the increase of β 2 in the impinging stage the impingement force peak values are smaller than the case without front house and decrease with the increase of the β shown in fig 19 a 3 in the increasing stage the peak value increases with the increase of β when β 2 the peak values is smaller than that of without front house case but is a little larger than without front house case when β 2 4 in the quasi stable stage the average in line force is smaller than the case without front house and decreases with the increase of β 5 the mitigation effect is improved as β increases the impulse on the rear house decreases as the increase of β because of the shortening of the duration of main tsunami force and decrease of the average main tsunami force when β increases just as stated in section 4 3 1 the confluence of the two split branches may generate a relative larger bore height than the case without front house which result in a larger peak value than the case without front house i e β 2 in fig 19 b and the crosswise z axis direction velocities of the branches increase with the increase of β and the collision between two branches become more violent which makes the reconstructed bore height increase shown in fig 20 also the larger β allows a longer approaching time before two branches meet in the centerline which leads to the location of reconstruction bore further from the front house in other words nearer to the rear house then the decrease of the bore height during the propagation process will be smaller for larger β cases so larger β larger bore height and smaller decrease of the bore height generating lager peak value in the increasing stage i e β 2 0 1 5 shown in fig 19 b compared with the case with larger β i e β 2 the tsunami wave in the cases with smaller β i e β 0 5 can flow around the front house more easily and quickly the bulk of blocked water is smaller and its run up is smaller too in front of the front house shown in fig 21 in other words in smaller β case the bulk of water behind the front house is larger and the in line velocity of which is larger which results in a relatively larger average in line force and longer duration namely weaker protection effect than the cases with larger β shown in fig 19 b fig 22 shows the evolution of water surface at the view plane same as the view plane defined in fig 16 a of different β the run up height of β 2 is a little higher than β 0 5 which results in a larger bore forces at increasing stage however at the quasi stable stage for example at t 8s the water surface height of β 2 is smaller than that of β 0 5 which leads to a smaller force in the quasi stable stage shown in fig 19 fig 23 shows the comparison of evolution of water surface of cases with different β at the view plane the flow behind the front house reconstructed and propagated its water surface height increased with time or x coordinate firstly then decreased during the propagation process the positions x coordinate of maximum water surface height of different β are marked in fig 23 they are x 14 20 m 14 02 m 13 79 m and 13 83 m when β 2 1 5 1 and 0 5 respectively the positions agree with the previous analysis that larger β allows a longer approaching time before two branches meet in the centerline which leads to the location of reconstruction bore further from the front house the maximum height of reconstructed bore increases with β approximately which is consistent with the water surface height in fig 16 f r time histories of the effective influencing width at different β when 3 125 is shown in fig 24 what can be observed is that values of f r increase with the decrease of β the bore front is supercritical but the flow behind the bore is subcritical generally compared with the case without houses shown in fig 18 values of f r at reconstructed bore front increase lightly for larger α or smaller β cases but decrease obviously for smaller α and larger β cases bore front is supercritical for larger α cases values of f r of flow behind bore fronts are less than the case without front houses and normally less than 1 indicating the flow changing into subcritical because of blockage of the front house according to árnason et al 2009 when f r 1 energy loss in the bore can become significant so energy loss in the reconstructed bore is relatively smaller compared with the case without houses as blockage of front house dissipate a part of energy in other words the front house plays a protective role 4 4 estimation of the mitigating effect as air layer might affect the calculation precision of peak values in the impinging stage shown in fig 5 peak values on the rear house in the increasing stage namely f 0 m a x and f m a x for the cases without and with front house respectively are used to define mitigation index η f 0 m a x f m a x f 0 m a x to describe the mitigation effect it can be observed in fig 25 a that η decreases sharply with α when α 5 625 indicating the front house has an obvious protecting effect on mitigating the peak force of tsunami force on the rear house when α 5 625 η almost keeps stable and decreases to zero i e β 0 75 or is less than zero i e β 0 75 indicating the front house has almost no protecting effect or even increases the peak value of tsunami force on the rear house it can be observed in fig 25 b that when α 4 375 η increases with relative bay width β indicating the protecting effect increases with the enlargement of the relative bay width however when α 4 375 η decreases with β and η is less than zero for larger β indicating the front house almost has no protecting effect on reducing the peak value of the tsunami force on the rear house or even worth introducing a larger peak value note that above conclusion is obtained based on the peak value of the increasing stage however the protection effect is improved with the increase of β and decrease of α because of shortening of the duration of main tsunami force and decrease of the average main tsunami force just as stated in sections 4 3 1 and 4 3 2 5 conclusions mitigation of tsunami bore force on the typical detached residential houses located in china s south east coastal village is numerically investigated in this study 3d numerical dam break wave is used to simulate tsunami bore in the 3d numerical flume by ansys fluent the numerical method including grid size boundary conditions turbulence model etc is validated by comparisons of tsunami bore height velocity and in line force on cylinder with those of the physical experiment by árnason et al 2009 the time history of the tsunami in line force on the detached house without protection of the front house is divided into four stages i e the impinging stage increasing stage decreasing stage and quasi stable stage and the characteristics of each stage are analyzed then the influence of relative clear distance α and relative bay width β on the above four stages are discussed elaborately and summarized as 1 the arriving time of the tsunami bore is delayed by the front house the larger α the longer the delayed time the larger β the longer the delayed time 2 in the impinging stage the peak value of the impact force is smaller than the case without front house except for the cases with larger α i e α 11 875 and increases with the increase of α decreases with the increase of β 3 in the increasing stage the peak value can be slightly larger than the case without front house for the cases with larger α i e α 11 875 5 625 or larger β i e β 2 the peak value increases with the increase of α and also increases with the increase of β when α is large enough i e α 5 625 4 in the quasi stable stage the average in line force is smaller than the case without front house and increases with the increase of α decreases with the increase of β 5 the mitigation effect improves as α decreases and improves as β increases also the mechanisms of the influence of α and β on the tsunami force are explored and results show 1 if the gap between the front and rear houses is large enough for the reconstruction of the tsunami bore the peak values of the impinging stage and increasing stage may be larger than those of the without front house case respectively because of the increased bore height generated during the confluence process of the two branches 2 the larger water depth at the downstream face relative to the upstream face of the rear house which resulted from the un fully developed reconstructed bore is mainly responsible for the minus in line force namely the force pointing to upstream 3 when α is large i e α 9 375 the larger β provides a longer crosswise distance for the two branches to approach to the centerline of the flume which makes the two branches generate larger crosswise velocities and collide more violently then generates a larger reconstruction bore height at a location closer to the rear house which ultimately produces a larger peak value in the increasing stage 4 the larger β the smaller bulk of the water impacts on the rear house and lower runup in front of the rear house which results a smaller average in line force in the quasi stable stage at last the chart of mitigation index η varies with α and β is presented which is beneficial to plan the new residential house and meaningful for further study acknowledgements this work is supported by the national natural science

23372,an analytical study is presented in this paper for oblique wave scattering by a floating elastic plate in a one or two layer body of water over a porous seabed of infinite depth the solution procedure adopted under the assumption of small amplitude surface waves and structural response is the eigenfunction expansion method the study aims to look into the interaction between oblique waves and a floating elastic plate that serves as an effective breakwater effects of three types of edge conditions viz i free edge ii simple supported edge and iii clamped edge are analyzed numerical results for the reflection and transmission coefficients are computed and examined for various values of the wave porous bed and structural parameters results for wave interaction with an elastic plate over a non porous bed are obtained as special cases and compared with results available in the literature the study reveals that for various combinations of wave and structural parameters zero reflection and full transmission may occur in case of rigid bottom and real porous effect parameter of the porous bed however for complex porous effect parameter zero reflection and full transmission do not occur moreover due to the energy dissipation by porous bed wave transmission decreases significantly with increase in length of the floating plate in case of complex porous effect parameter the results will be useful in the design of breakwaters for the protection of harbors inlets and beaches against attacks from surface waves keywords oblique waves porous seabed floating elastic plate two layer fluid 1 introduction over the past few decades marine floating structures have been extensively investigated by researchers as well as practicing engineers for a wide range of applications in ocean and coastal engineering the main advantage of floating structures is that they allow free passage of currents thereby avoiding undesirable problems such as sediment deposition near the structures in particular there has been an increasing interest in the use of flexible floating structures as breakwaters since flexible structures may enhance wave attenuation through wave structure interaction and most importantly these structures are light in weight cost effective reusable and environmental friendly a variety of mathematical techniques have been developed for wave interaction with floating or submerged structures various aspects of wave interaction with very large floating structures have been examined by among many others fox and squire 1994 meylan and squire 1996 and chen et al 2006 using fourier analysis and a newly developed inner product sahoo et al 2001 studied the scattering of surface waves by a floating semi infinite elastic plate in a two dimensional water domain of finite depth meanwhile teng et al 2001 applied a modified eigenfunction method to wave interaction with a semi infinite elastic plate sturova 2009 developed the time domain mode expansion method for hydroelastic analysis of the heterogeneous plate floating on shallow water of variable depth oblique scattering of waves by a moored finite floating elastic plate with changes in bottom topography was recently examined by karmakar and soares 2012 papathanasiou et al 2015 developed model based on finite element method for two dimensional problems concerning the response of large floating elastic bodies in an inhomogeneous shallow water environment characterized by variable bathymetry and thickness distribution an experimental validation of theoretical models of regular water wave transmission through arrays of floating disks is investigated by bennetts and williams 2015 moreover the presence of thermal strain surface friction due to wind and water flow beneath the ice are the natural sources of compressive stress on a floating ice sheet in case of a large compressive force buckling phenomena occurs and details of this phenomena has been studied by mohanty et al 2014 in case of flexural gravity wave motion over rigid bed apart from wave interaction with floating structures there has been a parallel interest in the problems of wave interaction with submerged structures hassan et al 2009 analyzed the surface wave interaction with submerged flexible plates of finite and semi infinite length in two and three dimensional fluid domains williams and meylan 2012 presented an analytical study on the surface wave interaction with a semi infinite submerged elastic plate using the wiener hopf technique there is a sizeable body of literature on the study of full partial i e fully or partially extended across the water column porous breakwater of finite width using the model of sollitt and cross 1972 oblique wave transmission by fully extended porous structures was studied by dalrymple et al 1991 followed by losada et al 1996 who studied wave interaction with submerged porous structures a thorough review on wave interaction with various perforated breakwaters can be found in huang et al 2011 to avoid the complex dispersion relation within the porous medium liu and li 2013 developed an alternative analytic solution method for wave past a porous structure koley et al 2015 used a boundary element method to study wave interaction with bottom standing submerged structures that have a perforated outer layer and are placed on a sloping bed in coastal waters density stratifications often happen as a result of solar heating or the meeting of fresh water with salty water in estuarine regions recently there has been a growing interest in studying wave structure interaction in a two layer fluid system by considering an upper lighter fluid of density ρ 1 overlying a heavier fluid of density ρ 2 various aspects of wave motion in a two layer fluid have been studied by linton and mciver 1995 sherief et al 2004 kashiwagi et al 2006 and the references cited therein bhattacharjee and sahoo 2008 looked into problems of flexural gravity waves in a two layer fluid xu and lu 2010 and lin and lu 2013 also presented analytical models for interaction between waves and a floating elastic plate in a two layer fluid recently oblique wave interaction with flexible and porous barriers in a two layer fluid was examined by behera et al 2013 unlike wave propagation over impermeable rigid bed in the case of water wave propagation over a permeable seabed various dissipation mechanisms associated with the porous medium contribute to wave damping and thus transforms the wave characteristics an enhanced coupled mode system is developed by belibassakis 2012 for modeling wave induced pressure and groundwater flow in variable bathymetry coastal regions in the layer under the permeable seabed on the other hand to study wave motion over a porous seabed a special type of porous bed condition was used by martha et al 2007 and maiti and mandal 2014 in which the fluid flow within the porous bed is not taken into consideration and the porosity parameter is similar to the porous effect parameter introduced by yu and chwang 1994 with the resistance effect being predominant in this model the rigid bed condition is replaced by a boundary condition which is assumed to be a porous bed the bed depth is assumed to be infinitely extended the fluid motions are such that the resulting boundary condition on the sea bed used holds good agreement and depends on a known parameter g which has a dimension of l e n g t h 1 called the porous effect parameter this assumption ensures the existence of plane wave solution that will decay otherwise at the far field in the open water region to the authors knowledge there exists no study in the literature that considers oblique wave scattering by a floating elastic plate in a single or two layer fluid over such a seabed the present work aims to look into the problem of oblique wave scattering by a floating flexible plate over a porous bed as discussed above in both the cases of single and two layer fluids with the assumption that there exist an interface in case of the two layer fluid it may be noted that the physical problems for single and two layer are different from practical point of view for example in case of a homogeneous fluid a single plane progressive wave will propagate due to the presence of the free surface on the other hand in two layer fluid plane progressive waves in surface and internal modes will propagate due to the presence of the free surface and interface as a result incident reflected and transmitted wave characteristics in surface and internal modes are discussed in case of two layer fluids which is not the case for homogeneous single layer fluid the mathematical problems are formulated under the assumption of small amplitude water wave theory and structural response it is also assumed that the flexible plate is under the action of a uniform compressive force effect of three different types of edge conditions namely clamped edge simply supported edge and free edge are analyzed in the present study the roots of the dispersion relation in the open water and plate covered regions over a porous bed are analyzed using contour plots in case of two layer fluid due to the presence of the interface there exist waves modes in the surface and internal modes in both the cases of the open water region and plate covered region thus in the case of two layer fluid the reflection and transmission coefficients exist in surface and internal modes moreover in the present study the porous effect parameter which signifies the bed porosity is assumed to be a complex number to account for the both the inertia and resistance effects various numerical results for the reflection and transmission coefficients are computed and analyzed to study the effects compressive force length of the plate porous effect parameter of the porous bed oblique angle of incidence structural rigidity of the plate position of the interface and density ratio the computed results are compared with those available in the literature for the special case of wave scattering by a floating elastic plate over a non porous porous bed in a single two layer fluid system 2 wave scattering by a floating elastic plate in a single layer fluid system in this subsection wave scattering by a floating elastic plate over a porous bed is studied for a homogeneous fluid 2 1 mathematical formulation three dimensional cartesian coordinates are chosen wherein the z axis is taken vertically downward positive into the fluid region with z 0 being the undisturbed free surface and the x y plane is considered as a horizontal plane it is assumed that a thin elastic plate having length b and uniform thickness d floats on the mean free surface z 0 of a fluid medium of uniform density ρ and water of finite depth h in the present study for dealing with more realistic physical situation in which both the resistance and inertia effects will contribute for energy dissipation by the seabed the porous effect parameter is assumed to be complex in nature unlike in the work of martha et al 2007 and maiti and mandal 2014 in which the porous effect parameter was assumed to be a real number to ensure progressive wave at the far field moreover in the present study the fluid motion inside the porous bed is not considered since water depth is finite only boundary condition at interface between fluid and porous bed is used to handle the physical problem under the assumption that the porous seabed is infinitely extended in the horizontal direction the whole fluid domain is divided into three sub domains as shown in fig 1 namely the open water region x 0 as region 1 the region below the flexible plate 0 x b as region 2 and the open water region x b as region 3 the fluid is assumed to be inviscid incompressible and the fluid motion is considered irrotational and simple harmonic in time with an angular frequency ω which ensures the existence of velocity potentials φ j x y z t for j 1 2 3 in the three regions the velocity potentials φ j for j 1 2 3 satisfy the three dimensional laplace equation given by 1 2 x 2 2 y 2 2 z 2 φ j 0 the boundary condition on the permeable bed is given by as in martha et al 2007 and maiti and mandal 2014 2 φ j z g φ j 0 on z h for j 1 2 3 where g is the porous effect parameter characterizing the bed permeability having dimension of length in general the porous effect parameter is a complex number to account for both the resistance and inertia effect as in yu and chwang 1994 it may be noted that to ensure propagation of progressive wave at the far field in the open water region g was assumed to be a real number see maiti and mandal 2014 assuming that there is no gap between air and water as well as the fluid and the floating elastic plate the linearized kinematic condition on the mean free surface yields 3 φ j z η j t on z 0 for j 1 2 3 where η 1 and η 3 are the free surface elevations in the open water regions 1 and 3 respectively and η 2 is the deflection of the floating plate the linearized dynamic condition on the mean free surface in regions 1 and 3 yield 4 φ j t g η j on z 0 for j 1 3 where g is the acceleration due to gravity eliminating η j for j 1 3 from the kinematic and dynamic conditions given by eqs 3 and 4 the linearized free surface boundary conditions in the open water regions 1 and 3 are obtained as follows 5 2 φ j t 2 g φ j z on z 0 for j 1 3 moreover from bernoulli s equation the linearized pressure p h x y z t acting on the floating plate as in mohanty et al 2014 is obtained as 6 p h ρ φ 2 t ρ g η 2 on z 0 in the presence of a uniform compressive force n along the x y plane the thin plate equation yields 7 e i x y 4 n x y 2 ρ e d 2 t 2 η 2 p h where e and ρ e are young s modulus and density of the elastic plate respectively with i d 3 12 1 ν 2 and ν being the poisson ratio of the elastic plate using eqs 3 6 and 7 the linearized plate covered boundary condition is obtained as 8 e i x y 4 n x y 2 ρ e d 2 t 2 ρ g φ 2 z ρ 2 φ 2 t 2 on z 0 moreover assuming that the incident wave is propagating at an angle θ with respect to the x axis the velocity potentials and free surface elevations in each region are of the form φ j x y z t re ϕ j x z e i μ y y ω t and η j x y t re η x e i μ y y ω t respectively for j 1 2 3 where μ y k 0 sin θ with k 0 being the wave number of the plane gravity wave thus the spatial velocity potential ϕ j x z for j 1 2 3 will satisfy the helmholtz equation given by 9 2 x 2 2 z 2 μ y 2 ϕ j 0 for j 1 2 3 along with the boundary conditions as in eqs 2 5 further using eq 1 the dynamic boundary condition as in eq 8 can be rewritten as following mohapatra et al 2013 10 d 4 z 4 q 2 z 2 m k 1 ϕ 2 z k ϕ 2 0 where d e i ρ g q n ρ g k ω 2 g and m ρ e d ρ further the continuity of pressure and velocity near the fluid structure interfaces at x 0 and x b yield 11 ϕ j 0 z ϕ 2 0 z ϕ j 0 z x ϕ 2 0 z x where j 1 at x 0 and j 3 at x b it is assumed that the edges of the floating plate are either free simply supported or clamped in the case of free edges the bending moment and shear force are zero on the edges and the conditions are given by 12 e i 2 x 2 ν μ y 2 ϕ 2 z 0 e i 2 x 2 2 ν μ y 2 x q x ϕ 2 z 0 at 0 0 and b 0 in the case of simply supported edges the deflection and bending moment of the plate are zero and the conditions are given by 13 ϕ 2 z 0 e i 2 x 2 ν μ y 2 ϕ 2 z 0 at 0 0 and b 0 while the plate deflection and slope of the plate deflection are zero in the case of clamped edges and the conditions are given by 14 ϕ 2 z 0 2 ϕ 2 x z 0 at 0 0 and b 0 finally the radiation condition for oblique wave scattering by a floating elastic plate over a porous bed yields 15 ϕ j x z i 0 e i q 0 x r 0 e i q 0 x f 0 k 0 z j 1 x t 0 e i q 0 x f 0 k 0 z j 3 x where i 0 is the known constant associated with the amplitude of the incident wave r 0 and t 0 are the unknown constants associated with the reflected and transmitted wave amplitudes respectively with q 0 k 0 2 μ y 2 and k 0 being the most predominant progressive wave number which is a complex number in general however in case of real g k 0 becomes a real positive number details about the roots of the dispersion relation will be discussed in the subsequent section 16 k 0 k 0 tanh k 0 h g k k 0 g tanh k 0 h further in eq 15 f 0 k 0 z is the eigenfunction associated with k 0 and is given by 17 f 0 k 0 z i g ω k 0 cosh k 0 h z g sinh k 0 h z cosh k 0 h g sinh k 0 h 2 2 method of solution the spatial velocity potentials in regions 1 2 and 3 satisfying the governing equation 9 along with the boundary conditions prescribed in eqs 2 5 and 15 are written as 18 ϕ j x z i 0 e i q 0 x f 0 k 0 z n 0 r n e i q n x f n k n z for x 0 j 1 n 0 a n e i q n x b n e i q n x b g n p n z for 0 x b j 2 n 0 t n e i q n x b f n k n z for x b j 3 where r n a n b n and t n for n 0 1 2 are unknown expansion coefficients to be determined with q n k n 2 μ y 2 and q n p n 2 μ y 2 and the eigenfunctions f n k n z and g n p n z are given by 19 f n k n z i g ω k n cosh k n h z g sinh k n h z cosh k n h g sinh k n h 20 g n p n z i g ω p n cosh p n h z g sinh p n h z cosh p n h g sinh p n h in the open water regions 1 and 3 the eigenvalues k n satisfy the dispersion relation 21 k n k n tanh k n h g k k n g tanh k n h on the other hand in the plate covered region 2 the eigenvalues p n satisfy the dispersion relation 22 d p n 4 q p n 2 m k 1 p n 2 tanh p n h p n g k p n g tanh p n h the eigenfunctions in the open water regions f n k n z are orthonormal i e 23 0 h f n k n z f m k m z d z δ n m where δ n m is the kronecker delta however the vertical eigenfunctions in the plate covered region are not orthogonal as has been discussed by sahoo et al 2001 in the present study orthogonality of the eigenfunction in the open water regions are used to solve the boundary value problem it may be noted that for g 0 and q 0 the dispersion relation in eqs 21 and 22 reduce to the dispersion relations for the open water and plate covered regions respectively over a non porous bed as in maiti and mandal 2014 in the present work the nature of the roots of the dispersion relation in the open water and plate covered regions as given in eqs 21 and 22 are analyzed in fig 2 a and b using contour plots as has been performed by fox and squire 1990 for determining the roots of the dispersion equations in the open water and plate covered regions newton raphson method is used initial guess in the newton raphson method for each root is obtained using contour plot unlike gravity waves over a non porous bed fig 2 a reveals that the dispersion relation in eq 21 has two real roots k 0 further it has infinite many imaginary roots of opposite signs k n n 1 2 3 which imply the existence of evanescent modes of which only the first few roots are shown here on the other hand unlike flexural gravity wave motion over a non porous bed fig 2 b shows that the dispersion relation given in eq 22 has two real roots p 0 four complex roots p i p i i p i i i and p i v with p i p i v and p i i p i i i which are non propagating in nature there is a sequence of purely imaginary roots p n n 1 2 3 which also imply the existence of evanescent modes similar observations were made by maiti and mandal 2014 in the case of a porous bed and by fox and squire 1994 in the case of a non porous bed on the other hand fig 3 reveals that when the porous effect parameter g is complex all the roots of the dispersion relations in open water and plate covered regions are complex in nature and all the roots are in close proximity with the roots discussed in fig 2 and the forms of the velocity potentials will remain similar to that of the real valued g as in eq 18 moreover it may be noted that the roots of the dispersion relation which are close to the real axis are referred as the most predominant progressive wave modes as discussed in behera and sahoo 2014 these modes are considered in the radiation condition as in eq 15 to account for the wave motion in regions i and 3 next using the matching conditions at x 0 and x b as in eq 11 and the orthogonality of the eigenfunctions as defined in eq 23 and truncating the infinite sums after ℕ terms a system of 4 ℕ 4 equations for the determination of the unknowns associated with the velocity potentials in eq 18 are obtained as follows 24 ℕ n 0 r n x n m ℕ n 0 a n b n e i q n b y n m δ 0 m i 0 x 0 m 25 ℕ n 0 q n r n x n m ℕ n 0 q n a n b n e i q n b y n m δ 0 m q 0 i 0 x 0 m 26 ℕ n 0 t n x n m ℕ n 0 a n e i q n b b n y n m 0 27 n 0 ℕ q n t n x n m n 0 ℕ q n a n e i q n b b n y n m 0 where 28 x n m 0 h f n k n z f m k m z d z and y n m 0 h g n p n z f m k m z d z further it is assumed that the edges of the floating elastic plate are simple supported thus using eq 13 four additional equations are obtained as follows 29 ℕ n 0 e n p n a n b n e i q n b 0 30 ℕ n 0 e n p n a n e i q n b b n 0 31 ℕ n 0 e i q n 2 ν μ y 2 e n p n a n b n e i q n b 0 32 ℕ n 0 e i q n 2 ν μ y 2 e n p n a n e i q n b b n 0 where 33 e n p n sinh p n h g cosh p n h p n cosh p n h g sinh p n h solving the system of equations as given in eqs 24 27 and 29 32 will determine the unknown constants r n a n b n and t n similarly eqs 12 and 14 are used in the case of the floating plate having free or clamped edges respectively 2 3 numerical results and discussion in this subsection the effects of various wave and structural parameters such as bed porosity and plate characteristics are investigated in a homogeneous fluid of uniform density by analyzing the reflection and transmission coefficients which are computed using matlab programs these reflection and transmission coefficients will provide global information about the scattering and dissipation of wave energy by the floating plate in the presence of porous sea bed moreover the role of compressive force and bed porosity on the phase and group velocity is analyzed to understand the general characteristics of wave motion unless stated otherwise the following values of physical parameters are considered i 0 1 m h 5 m t 5 sec b h 6 g h 0 25 0 25 i g 9 81 m sec2 θ 20 ν 0 3 e 5 gpa d 0 1 m and n e i ρ g once the unknowns are determined the reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients can be easily computed using the formulae 34 k r r 0 i 0 k t t 0 i 0 and k d 1 k r 2 k t 2 in order to study the convergence of the infinite series numerical values of reflection coefficients k r are computed for different values of ℕ and illustrated table 1 for certain fixed values of k 0 h where ℕ 0 represents the progressive wave mode solution table 1 reveals that the numerical results converge up to 5 decimal accuracy for ℕ larger than 15 in fig 4 a and b the phase velocity ω p 0 and group velocity d ω d p 0 versus wave number p 0 are plotted respectively for different values of the porous effect parameter g h and compressive force n in case of flexural gravity wave motion over a porous bed fig 4 a reveals that for n 2 e i ρ g 1 2 zero phase velocity occurs in case of each g h this value of n is referred to as critical compressive force for which the frequency of the progressive wave vanishes as discussed in mohapatra et al 2013 in case of rigid bed however phase velocity decreases with an increase in the values of the porous effect parameter g h on the other hand from fig 4 b it is observed that the group velocity is negative for n 2 e i ρ g 1 2 which indicates that the wave crest and wave group move in opposite direction further for p 0 0 069 and n 2 e i ρ g 1 2 certain discontinuity in wave energy propagation is observed irrespective of g h and is similar to the observation made in mohanty et al 2014 for g h 0 which ensures that the value of the critical compressive force is unaltered in the presence of the sea bed porosity for critical compressive force n 2 e i ρ g 1 2 the group velocity does not exist mathematically see mohanty et al 2014 and buckling occurs under such circumstances this will lead to the discontinuity in the behavior of the propagation of flexural gravity waves similar observations were made by schulkes et al 1987 however for g h 0 the group velocity decreases with an increase in n below the critical compressive force limit this may be due to the fact that critical value of the compressive force is a plate characteristics while porous effect parameter is a characteristic of the sea bed the bed porosity will change the wave induced response not the structural characteristics of the floating plate thus in the present study the values of compressive force n is restricted to values below the critical compressive force in fig 5 a and b the reflection coefficient versus ω h g are plotted for different values of non dimensional plate length b h with θ 0 and 30 respectively in case of plate having free edge conditions both the figures reveals that the curves of reflection coefficients k r obtained by the present theory for rigid bed g h 0 are in close agreement with fig 2 of sturova 1999 moreover with an increase in non dimensional plate length b h the number of zeros in wave reflection increases a comparison between fig 5 a and b reveals that there is a decrease in the frequency of occurrence of zero reflection for oblique angle of incidence further for smaller plate length wave reflection is less for oblique angle of incidence in fig 6 a the reflection and transmission coefficients versus non dimensional plate length k 0 b are plotted for different edge conditions namely clamped simply supported and free edges fig 6 a reveals that the plate having clamped edges exhibits larger reflection and smaller transmission which indicates that a major part of the wave energy will be reflected in case of a clamped edge plate and thus less wave will transmit below the plate however plate having free edges exhibits smaller reflection and larger transmission compared to the other two types of edge conditions thus in case of a floating plate with free edge wave induced force on the floating plate will be more as more wave energy will transmit through the structure compared to that a plate having clamped or simply supported edge the dissipation coefficient versus k 0 b is plotted for different edge conditions in fig 6 b fig 6 b depicts that wave energy dissipates more with increase in plate length both the figures reveal that the reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients follow certain oscillatory pattern with an increase in the structural length moreover the study reveals that the amplitude of oscillation decrease with an increase in non dimensional length k 0 b as energy loss takes place by the porous bed as it is found that the plate having clamped edges results more reflection and less transmission clamped edge may be preferred as an effective edge condition hereafter all the numerical results in the manuscript are discussed for a floating plate having clamped edges in fig 7 a the reflection and transmission coefficients and b dissipation coefficients versus k 0 b are plotted for different values of the porous effect parameter g h fig 7 a reveals that in case of non porous bed g h 0 and real g h the reflection and transmission coefficients follow certain oscillatory pattern and zero reflection and full transmission observed periodically and satisfies the energy relation k 2 2 k t 2 1 on the other hand for complex values of the porous effect parameter g h k 2 2 k t 2 1 due to the dissipation of wave energy by the porous bed moreover in case of complex g h with an increase in non dimensional length of the plate k 0 b the amplitude of the oscillation of the reflection coefficient decreases uniformly with an increase in plate length the uniform decrease in wave reflection is due to the dissipation of wave energy by the porous sea bed moreover wave reflection and transmission decrease with an increase in the absolute value of g h in case of complex g h fig 7 b reveals that the dissipation coefficient k d increases with an increase in the absolute value of the porous effect parameter g h and plate length which is due to the dissipation of wave energy as it passes through the porous bed in fig 8 a and b the reflection and transmission coefficients versus non dimensional plate length k 0 b are plotted for different values of young s modulus of the floating plate e and compressive force n respectively fig 8 a depicts that the increase in young s modulus of the plate e results in an increase in the wave reflection but a decrease in the wave transmission the plate becomes more rigid with larger e i and therefore most of the waves which concentrate near the free surface are reflected back and in the process less wave energy is transmitted below the plate similar observations were made by sahoo et al 2001 and maiti and mandal 2014 in the case of wave scattering by a semi infinite plate over a porous non porous bed thus the plate having a moderate value of e are suitable as an effective coastal structure for wave attenuation on the other hand the wave reflection decreases and transmission increases with an increase in compressive force n as shown fig 8 b an increase in compressive force often enhances the structural deformation which result in the increase in the wave transmission and decrease in wave reflection within the critical limit this may be due to the decay in the rate of energy propagation by the floating plate with an increase in compressive force as observed in fig 4 in fig 9 a and b the reflection and transmission coefficients versus oblique angle θ are plotted for different values of the porous effect parameter g h and young s modulus e of the floating plate respectively fig 9 a reveals that zero reflection and full transmission occur for certain values of the angle of incidence θ in case of non porous bed g h 0 and real g h and this angle is said to be the critical angle which is similar to the observation found in behera et al 2013 and fox and squire 1994 however zero reflection and full transmission do not occur for complex g h on the other hand with an increase in the absolute value of the complex porous effect parameter there is an increase in the value of the angle of incidence for which wave reflection attends certain minimum which is due to the dissipation of wave energy by the porous bed fig 9 b depicts that the reflection coefficient increases with an increase in young s modulus e while an opposite pattern is observed in the transmission coefficient which is similar to be observation found in fig 8 a 3 wave scattering by a floating elastic plate in a two layer fluid system in this subsection the problem for wave scattering by a floating elastic plate in a two layer fluid over a porous bed is presented unlike the case of a single layer fluid due to the presence of the interface and the free surface and plate covered surface there exist two wave modes in each of the open water regions and plate covered region as discussed in behera et al 2013 and bhattacharjee and sahoo 2008 3 1 mathematical formulation in this case the fluid and structural characteristics are the same as have been considered in subsection 2 1 except that the fluid domain is occupied by two immiscible fluids having the mean interface at z h the upper and lower fluids are of finite depths 0 z h and h z h and constant densities ρ 1 and ρ 2 respectively as shown in fig 10 the velocity potentials φ j for j 1 2 3 satisfy eq 1 along with the boundary conditions 2 8 with ρ being replaced by ρ 1 further using the continuity of velocity and pressure at the interface the dynamic and boundary conditions at the mean interface at z h yield as in bhattacharjee and sahoo 2008 where ξ j for j 1 2 3 are the interface elevations in regions 1 2 3 respectively and s ρ 1 ρ 2 with 0 s 1 moreover the spatial velocity potential satisfy the helmholtz equation as in eq 9 along with the boundary conditions given in eqs 10 14 now the radiation condition for oblique wave scattering by a floating elastic plate in a two layer fluid over porous bed gives 37 ϕ j x z i i n i i n e i q n x r n e i q n x f n k n z j 1 x i i n i t n e i q n x f n k n z j 3 x where i n r n and t n for n i i i are constants associated with the incident reflected and transmitted wave amplitudes respectively in the surface and internal modes with q n k n 2 μ y 2 here k i and k i i are the complex wave numbers associated with the most predominant progressive waves surface mode sm and the internal mode im in the open water regions 1 and 3 respectively with f n k n z being the associated eigenfunctions details about the roots of the dispersion relation will be discussed in the subsequent section 3 2 method of solution for analyzing the role of wave motion in the two layer fluid domain it is assumed that the plane progressive flexural gravity waves in the surface and internal modes are of the forms η re η 0 e i p x ω t and ζ re ζ 0 e i p x ω t with η 0 and ζ 0 being the amplitudes of the flexural gravity waves in the surface and internal modes respectively using the governing equation 1 along with boundary conditions 2 4 and 35 36 the velocity potential can be written as 38 φ x z t i ω μ cosh p z sinh p z η p 0 z h i ω p cosh p h z g sinh p h z ζ p p sinh p h h g cosh p h h h z h where g is the porous effect parameter associated with the porous bed as discussed in section 2 and p is the wave number of the gravity waves in the plate covered region which satisfies the dispersion relation 39 k m p μ p d p 4 q p 2 1 in eq 39 μ is given by 40 μ s tanh p h l k 1 s p coth p h s coth p h l k

equivalent form of eq 39 is given by 43 u p k 2 v p k w p 0 where u p m p g s coth p h h m p s g coth p h 1 g m s coth p h h coth p h s g m v p p c g m 1 s coth p h h z coth p h g coth p h h coth p h

the open water region in the presence of a porous bed and the dispersion relation in the open water region in terms of k is given by 44 u w k 2 v w k w w 0 where u w s coth k h h coth k h g s coth k h h coth k h v w k coth k h h coth k h g coth k h h coth k h 1 w w k 2 1 s 1 g coth k h h it may be noted that for g 0 and q 0 the dispersion relation in eqs 43 and 44 reduce to the dispersion relations for the open water and plate covered regions respectively in a two layer fluid over a non porous bed as in lin and lu 2013 further for q 0 s 1 and h h the dispersion relations in eqs 43 and 44 reduce to the corresponding dispersion relations in the case of a single layer fluid as given in eqs 21 and 22 respectively in a manner similar to that for a single layer fluid as described in subsection 2 1 the roots of the dispersion relations for open water and plate covered regions as given in eqs 43 and 44 are shown in fig 11 a and b respectively unlike gravity wave motion over a non porous bed fig 11 a reveals that the dispersion relation in eq 43 has two pairs of complex roots of opposite signs k i and k i i which are referred to as the wave numbers associated with the most predominant progressive waves in surface mode sm and internal mode im respectively further it has infinitely many complex roots which are close to the imaginary axis with opposite signs k n n 1 2 3 and correspond to the evanescent modes on the other hand unlike flexural gravity wave motion over an impermeable bed fig 11 b shows that the dispersion relation given in eq 44 has two pairs of complex roots of opposite signs p i and p i i and are referred to as the wave numbers associated with the most predominant progressive waves in the flexural gravity mode and internal mode and are very close to the real axis two pairs of complex roots of the forms p i i i p v i and p i v p v which are non propagating in nature and lies in the complex plane and there are a sequence of complex roots p n n 1 2 3 which are close to the imaginary axis and corresponds to the evanescent modes similar to behera and sahoo 2014 moreover similar observations were made by bhattacharjee and sahoo 2008 for a non porous bed where the wave number associated with the progressive wave mode is a real number and evanescent wave modes are purely imaginary numbers thus in a two layer fluid the forms of the spatial velocity potentials in regions 1 2 and 3 are given by 45 ϕ j x z ii n i i n e i q n x f n k n z n i ii 1 r n e i q n x f n k n z for x 0 j 1 n i ii 1 a n e i q n x b n e i q n x b g n p n z for 0 x b j 2 n i

surface and internal modes and are assumed to be known moreover r n and t n for n i and i i are associated with the amplitudes of the reflected and transmitted waves in surface and internal modes respectively in eq 45 k n and p n are the roots of the dispersion relation as given in eqs 43 and 44 respectively with q n k n 2 μ y 2 and q n p n 2 μ y 2 further the eigenfunctions f n k n z and g n k n z are given by 46 f n k n z sinh k n h h g cosh k n h h k n sinh k n h k cosh k n h k n cosh k n z k sinh k n z 0 z h cosh k n h z g sinh k n h z h z h 47 g n p n z sinh p n h h g cosh p n h h p n

k m z d z again in a manner similar to that in the case of a single layer fluid a system of equations for the determination of the unknowns associated with the velocity potentials in eq 45 are obtained as follows 49 ℕ n i i i 1 r n x n m ℕ n n i i i 1 a n b n e i q n b y n m i i n i δ n m i n x n m 50 ℕ n i i i 1 q n r n x n m ℕ n i i i 1 q n a n b n e i q n b y n m i i n i δ n m q n i n x

to satisfy one of the edge conditions namely free simply supported or built in edge in the context of the present section it is assumed that the plate is having simply supported edges thus using eq 13 four additional equations are obtained as below 55 ℕ n i i i 1 k e n p n a n b n e i q n b 0 56 ℕ n i i i 1 k e n p n a n e i q n b b n 0 57 ℕ n i i i 1 e i q n 2 ν μ y 2 k e n p n a n b n e i q n b 0

i i i 1 2 eqs 49 52 and 55 58 are solved similarly eqs 12 and 14 are used in the case of the floating plate having free and clamped edges respectively 3 3 numerical results and discussion in this case the depth ratio h h 0 2 density ratio s 0 75 and other parameters given in subsection 2 3 are kept fixed unless it is stated otherwise the reflection and transmission coefficients in sm and im can be easily computed using the formulae 60 k r i r i i i and k t i t i i i in sm k r i i r i i i i i and k t i i t i i i i i in im in fig 12 a and b the reflection and transmission coefficients versus oblique angle θ are plotted for waves in sm and im respectively for different values of the porous effect parameter g h fig 12 a depicts that with an increase in the absolute value of the porous effect parameter g h results lower reflection and transmission in sm further in sm zero reflection and full transmission occur for certain values of the angle of incidence θ in case of rigid bottom g h 0 and real g h similar observation is obtained for a homogeneous fluid as has been shown in fig 9 a moreover zero minimum in the reflection coefficient for waves in surface mode does not occur for complex porous effect parameter g h and the observation is similar to that of a homogeneous fluid moreover increasing absolute values of g h tends to shift the position of the minimum reflection for waves in sm fig 12 b depicts that with an increase in the oblique angle of incidence frequency of occurrence of zero wave reflection in internal mode increases and amplitude of oscillation in wave reflection increases with an increase in angle of incidence which may be due to the resonating interaction of the waves in surface and internal modes the maxima in wave reflection corresponds to the case of constructive interference while the minima corresponds to the case of destructive interference further the wave reflection and transmission decrease in im with an increase in the absolute values of g h the variations in wave reflection and transmission for waves in im compared to that in sm with an increase in the porous effect parameter is due to the fact that in a two layer fluid system the angle of incidence in surface mode and internal modes changes with stratification which follows snell s law of refraction in fig 13 a and b the reflection and transmission coefficients versus oblique angle θ are plotted for waves in sm and im respectively for different values of the depth ratio h h both the figures demonstrates that the general patterns in wave reflection and transmission are similar to those discussed above in fig 12 a and b owing to the higher wave energy concentration near the free surface the wave reflection is more and wave transmission is less in both sm and im when the interface is closer to the free surface similar observation was made by behera et al 2015 in the case of wave scattering by a partial porous structure in a two layer fluid fig 13 a depicts that with an increase in h h zero reflection and full transmission occur for lower values of oblique angle θ in fig 14 a and b the reflection and transmission coefficients versus oblique angle θ are plotted for waves in sm and im respectively for different values of the density ratio s from these figures it is observed that the reflection coefficient decreases while the transmission coefficient increases as the density ratio s increases this may be sue to the fact that as the density variation increases interfacial effect becomes more predominant and the role of waves in interface plays a significant role which obstruct the wave motion fig 14 b depicts that oscillatory patterns in wave reflection and transmission for waves in im increases with an increase in the density ratio s which is due to the mutual interaction between waves in surface and interface in fig 15 a and b the reflection and transmission coefficients versus oblique angle θ are plotted for waves in sm and im respectively for different values of young s modulus of the floating plate e from fig 15 a it is observed that the wave reflection increases while the wave transmission decreases with an increase in young s modulus of the plate e this is similar to the case of homogeneous fluid as has been seen in fig 7 b on the other hand fig 15 b depicts that the wave reflection decreases for im waves with an increase in e in fig 16 a and b the reflection and transmission coefficients versus oblique angle θ are plotted for waves in sm and im respectively for different values of compressive force n fig 16 a depicts that there are two times where minima of wave reflection occur in sm when compressive force tends to zero and 0 θ 90 while for larger values of compressive force n there is only one time where minimum of wave reflection occurs however the number of times where minima of reflection and maxima of transmission occur do not change with an increase in the compressive force as shown in fig 16 b for im waves generally k r i increases and k t i decreases as the compressive force increases while k r i i decreases and k t i i increases as the compressive force n increases in fig 17 a and b the reflection and transmission coefficients versus non dimensional plate length k i b are plotted for waves in sm and im respectively for different values of the porous effect parameter g h fig 17 a shows that both the wave reflection and transmission in sm decrease as a result of the increase in the absolute values of porous effect parameter g h moreover unlike the occurrence of multiple zeros in wave reflection for real value of porous effect parameter zero reflection does not occur for complex porous effect parameter g h with an increase in plate length k i b this is similar to that for homogeneous fluid as seen in fig 7 a on the other hand wave reflection increases and wave transmission decreases for waves in im with an increase in the absolute values of g h in the two layer fluid system since the total wave energy is conserved less energy concentration near the free surface corresponds to higher energy concentration at the interface thus due to the resonating interaction of the waves in sm and im waves in im becomes predominant and is reflected by the floating plate in fig 18 a and b the reflection and transmission coefficients versus non dimensional plate length k i b are plotted for waves in sm and im respectively for different values of the depth ratio h h the general patterns in wave reflection and transmission for sm and im waves are similar to those already observed in fig 17 a and b fig 18 a depicts that as the depth ratio h h increases the minima in the wave reflection for sm shifted to the left however fig 18 b depicts that for waves in im with an increase in h h the minima in the wave reflection shifted to the right from these figures it is observed that the amplitude of the oscillatory pattern of the reflection coefficient decreases with an increase in h h this is due to the concentration of higher amount of wave energy near the free surface as has been discussed in behera et al 2015 like the earlier discussion wave transmission follows an opposite trend to that of wave reflection for waves in sm and im in fig 19 a and b the reflection and transmission coefficients versus non dimensional plate length k i b are plotted for waves in sm and im respectively for different values of the density ratio s in general wave reflection decreases and the transmission increases for both sm and im waves with an increase in the density ratio s the patterns in wave reflection and transmission are more oscillatory in im when compared with that in sm the optimum wave reflection is due to the constructive interference while the minimum wave reflection is due to the destructive interference of the waves in sm and im moreover the increase in the frequency of occurrence of optimum wave reflection and transmission in im is due to the resonating interaction of the waves in surface and internal modes fig 19 b depicts that as with an increase in density ratio smaller wave reflection and nearly full transmission occur for waves in im with an increase in the density ratio the two fluid behaves like a single fluid and the role of the interface diminishes which results in the transmission of a major part of the wave energy with negligible reflection 4 conclusion in the present paper oblique wave scattering by a floating elastic plate over a porous bed is studied in single and two layer fluid systems the mathematical problems are formulated under the assumption of small amplitude waves and structural response and are solved using the eigenfunction expansion method numerical results are computed and discussed for the reflection and transmission coefficients to reveal effects due to the wave and structural parameters the computed results are validated by comparing with known results available in the literature in both the cases of a single and two layer fluids over a non porous bed inclusion of the resistance effect in the porous effect parameter leads to dissipation of global wave energy due to energy loss by porous sea bed a comparison for various types of edge conditions reveals that in case of a floating plate with free edge wave induced force on the floating plate will be more as more wave energy will transmit through the structure compared to that a plate having clamped or simply supported edge it is depicted that the critical compressive force for which wave celerity vanishes in the plate covered region is independent of the bed permeability however for g h 0 the group velocity decreases with an increase in the compressive force n below the critical compressive force limit the present study depicts that under particular conditions for some combinations of the wave and structural parameters zero reflection and full transmission may occur in case of rigid bottom and real g h for porous bed however for complex g h zero reflection and full transmission do not occur moreover in case of complex g h due the energy dissipation by porous bed wave transmission decreases significantly with increase in length of the floating plate further the study reveals that with an increase in the absolute values of the porous effect parameter of the porous bed both wave reflection and transmission decrease in both the case of single and two layer fluids the patterns in the wave reflection and transmission in the internal mode are more oscillatory when compared with that in the surface mode which is due to the resonating interaction of the waves in surface and interface modes due to the higher wave energy concentration near the free surface wave reflection is larger and wave transmission is hence lower for waves in either the surface or internal mode when the interface is closer to the free surface these findings will enhance the understanding of the wave energy distribution in a homogeneous and stratified fluid in oblique seas and will be of immense help in the design of floating breakwaters and other marine structures located on a porous sea bed the concept can be generalized to include the role of bottom undulation for dealing with wave structure interaction problems in the presence of porous bed 
23372,an analytical study is presented in this paper for oblique wave scattering by a floating elastic plate in a one or two layer body of water over a porous seabed of infinite depth the solution procedure adopted under the assumption of small amplitude surface waves and structural response is the eigenfunction expansion method the study aims to look into the interaction between oblique waves and a floating elastic plate that serves as an effective breakwater effects of three types of edge conditions viz i free edge ii simple supported edge and iii clamped edge are analyzed numerical results for the reflection and transmission coefficients are computed and examined for various values of the wave porous bed and structural parameters results for wave interaction with an elastic plate over a non porous bed are obtained as special cases and compared with results available in the literature the study reveals that for various combinations of wave and structural parameters zero reflection and full transmission may occur in case of rigid bottom and real porous effect parameter of the porous bed however for complex porous effect parameter zero reflection and full transmission do not occur moreover due to the energy dissipation by porous bed wave transmission decreases significantly with increase in length of the floating plate in case of complex porous effect parameter the results will be useful in the design of breakwaters for the protection of harbors inlets and beaches against attacks from surface waves keywords oblique waves porous seabed floating elastic plate two layer fluid 1 introduction over the past few decades marine floating structures have been extensively investigated by researchers as well as practicing engineers for a wide range of applications in ocean and coastal engineering the main advantage of floating structures is that they allow free passage of currents thereby avoiding undesirable problems such as sediment deposition near the structures in particular there has been an increasing interest in the use of flexible floating structures as breakwaters since flexible structures may enhance wave attenuation through wave structure interaction and most importantly these structures are light in weight cost effective reusable and environmental friendly a variety of mathematical techniques have been developed for wave interaction with floating or submerged structures various aspects of wave interaction with very large floating structures have been examined by among many others fox and squire 1994 meylan and squire 1996 and chen et al 2006 using fourier analysis and a newly developed inner product sahoo et al 2001 studied the scattering of surface waves by a floating semi infinite elastic plate in a two dimensional water domain of finite depth meanwhile teng et al 2001 applied a modified eigenfunction method to wave interaction with a semi infinite elastic plate sturova 2009 developed the time domain mode expansion method for hydroelastic analysis of the heterogeneous plate floating on shallow water of variable depth oblique scattering of waves by a moored finite floating elastic plate with changes in bottom topography was recently examined by karmakar and soares 2012 papathanasiou et al 2015 developed model based on finite element method for two dimensional problems concerning the response of large floating elastic bodies in an inhomogeneous shallow water environment characterized by variable bathymetry and thickness distribution an experimental validation of theoretical models of regular water wave transmission through arrays of floating disks is investigated by bennetts and williams 2015 moreover the presence of thermal strain surface friction due to wind and water flow beneath the ice are the natural sources of compressive stress on a floating ice sheet in case of a large compressive force buckling phenomena occurs and details of this phenomena has been studied by mohanty et al 2014 in case of flexural gravity wave motion over rigid bed apart from wave interaction with floating structures there has been a parallel interest in the problems of wave interaction with submerged structures hassan et al 2009 analyzed the surface wave interaction with submerged flexible plates of finite and semi infinite length in two and three dimensional fluid domains williams and meylan 2012 presented an analytical study on the surface wave interaction with a semi infinite submerged elastic plate using the wiener hopf technique there is a sizeable body of literature on the study of full partial i e fully or partially extended across the water column porous breakwater of finite width using the model of sollitt and cross 1972 oblique wave transmission by fully extended porous structures was studied by dalrymple et al 1991 followed by losada et al 1996 who studied wave interaction with submerged porous structures a thorough review on wave interaction with various perforated breakwaters can be found in huang et al 2011 to avoid the complex dispersion relation within the porous medium liu and li 2013 developed an alternative analytic solution method for wave past a porous structure koley et al 2015 used a boundary element method to study wave interaction with bottom standing submerged structures that have a perforated outer layer and are placed on a sloping bed in coastal waters density stratifications often happen as a result of solar heating or the meeting of fresh water with salty water in estuarine regions recently there has been a growing interest in studying wave structure interaction in a two layer fluid system by considering an upper lighter fluid of density ρ 1 overlying a heavier fluid of density ρ 2 various aspects of wave motion in a two layer fluid have been studied by linton and mciver 1995 sherief et al 2004 kashiwagi et al 2006 and the references cited therein bhattacharjee and sahoo 2008 looked into problems of flexural gravity waves in a two layer fluid xu and lu 2010 and lin and lu 2013 also presented analytical models for interaction between waves and a floating elastic plate in a two layer fluid recently oblique wave interaction with flexible and porous barriers in a two layer fluid was examined by behera et al 2013 unlike wave propagation over impermeable rigid bed in the case of water wave propagation over a permeable seabed various dissipation mechanisms associated with the porous medium contribute to wave damping and thus transforms the wave characteristics an enhanced coupled mode system is developed by belibassakis 2012 for modeling wave induced pressure and groundwater flow in variable bathymetry coastal regions in the layer under the permeable seabed on the other hand to study wave motion over a porous seabed a special type of porous bed condition was used by martha et al 2007 and maiti and mandal 2014 in which the fluid flow within the porous bed is not taken into consideration and the porosity parameter is similar to the porous effect parameter introduced by yu and chwang 1994 with the resistance effect being predominant in this model the rigid bed condition is replaced by a boundary condition which is assumed to be a porous bed the bed depth is assumed to be infinitely extended the fluid motions are such that the resulting boundary condition on the sea bed used holds good agreement and depends on a known parameter g which has a dimension of l e n g t h 1 called the porous effect parameter this assumption ensures the existence of plane wave solution that will decay otherwise at the far field in the open water region to the authors knowledge there exists no study in the literature that considers oblique wave scattering by a floating elastic plate in a single or two layer fluid over such a seabed the present work aims to look into the problem of oblique wave scattering by a floating flexible plate over a porous bed as discussed above in both the cases of single and two layer fluids with the assumption that there exist an interface in case of the two layer fluid it may be noted that the physical problems for single and two layer are different from practical point of view for example in case of a homogeneous fluid a single plane progressive wave will propagate due to the presence of the free surface on the other hand in two layer fluid plane progressive waves in surface and internal modes will propagate due to the presence of the free surface and interface as a result incident reflected and transmitted wave characteristics in surface and internal modes are discussed in case of two layer fluids which is not the case for homogeneous single layer fluid the mathematical problems are formulated under the assumption of small amplitude water wave theory and structural response it is also assumed that the flexible plate is under the action of a uniform compressive force effect of three different types of edge conditions namely clamped edge simply supported edge and free edge are analyzed in the present study the roots of the dispersion relation in the open water and plate covered regions over a porous bed are analyzed using contour plots in case of two layer fluid due to the presence of the interface there exist waves modes in the surface and internal modes in both the cases of the open water region and plate covered region thus in the case of two layer fluid the reflection and transmission coefficients exist in surface and internal modes moreover in the present study the porous effect parameter which signifies the bed porosity is assumed to be a complex number to account for the both the inertia and resistance effects various numerical results for the reflection and transmission coefficients are computed and analyzed to study the effects compressive force length of the plate porous effect parameter of the porous bed oblique angle of incidence structural rigidity of the plate position of the interface and density ratio the computed results are compared with those available in the literature for the special case of wave scattering by a floating elastic plate over a non porous porous bed in a single two layer fluid system 2 wave scattering by a floating elastic plate in a single layer fluid system in this subsection wave scattering by a floating elastic plate over a porous bed is studied for a homogeneous fluid 2 1 mathematical formulation three dimensional cartesian coordinates are chosen wherein the z axis is taken vertically downward positive into the fluid region with z 0 being the undisturbed free surface and the x y plane is considered as a horizontal plane it is assumed that a thin elastic plate having length b and uniform thickness d floats on the mean free surface z 0 of a fluid medium of uniform density ρ and water of finite depth h in the present study for dealing with more realistic physical situation in which both the resistance and inertia effects will contribute for energy dissipation by the seabed the porous effect parameter is assumed to be complex in nature unlike in the work of martha et al 2007 and maiti and mandal 2014 in which the porous effect parameter was assumed to be a real number to ensure progressive wave at the far field moreover in the present study the fluid motion inside the porous bed is not considered since water depth is finite only boundary condition at interface between fluid and porous bed is used to handle the physical problem under the assumption that the porous seabed is infinitely extended in the horizontal direction the whole fluid domain is divided into three sub domains as shown in fig 1 namely the open water region x 0 as region 1 the region below the flexible plate 0 x b as region 2 and the open water region x b as region 3 the fluid is assumed to be inviscid incompressible and the fluid motion is considered irrotational and simple harmonic in time with an angular frequency ω which ensures the existence of velocity potentials φ j x y z t for j 1 2 3 in the three regions the velocity potentials φ j for j 1 2 3 satisfy the three dimensional laplace equation given by 1 2 x 2 2 y 2 2 z 2 φ j 0 the boundary condition on the permeable bed is given by as in martha et al 2007 and maiti and mandal 2014 2 φ j z g φ j 0 on z h for j 1 2 3 where g is the porous effect parameter characterizing the bed permeability having dimension of length in general the porous effect parameter is a complex number to account for both the resistance and inertia effect as in yu and chwang 1994 it may be noted that to ensure propagation of progressive wave at the far field in the open water region g was assumed to be a real number see maiti and mandal 2014 assuming that there is no gap between air and water as well as the fluid and the floating elastic plate the linearized kinematic condition on the mean free surface yields 3 φ j z η j t on z 0 for j 1 2 3 where η 1 and η 3 are the free surface elevations in the open water regions 1 and 3 respectively and η 2 is the deflection of the floating plate the linearized dynamic condition on the mean free surface in regions 1 and 3 yield 4 φ j t g η j on z 0 for j 1 3 where g is the acceleration due to gravity eliminating η j for j 1 3 from the kinematic and dynamic conditions given by eqs 3 and 4 the linearized free surface boundary conditions in the open water regions 1 and 3 are obtained as follows 5 2 φ j t 2 g φ j z on z 0 for j 1 3 moreover from bernoulli s equation the linearized pressure p h x y z t acting on the floating plate as in mohanty et al 2014 is obtained as 6 p h ρ φ 2 t ρ g η 2 on z 0 in the presence of a uniform compressive force n along the x y plane the thin plate equation yields 7 e i x y 4 n x y 2 ρ e d 2 t 2 η 2 p h where e and ρ e are young s modulus and density of the elastic plate respectively with i d 3 12 1 ν 2 and ν being the poisson ratio of the elastic plate using eqs 3 6 and 7 the linearized plate covered boundary condition is obtained as 8 e i x y 4 n x y 2 ρ e d 2 t 2 ρ g φ 2 z ρ 2 φ 2 t 2 on z 0 moreover assuming that the incident wave is propagating at an angle θ with respect to the x axis the velocity potentials and free surface elevations in each region are of the form φ j x y z t re ϕ j x z e i μ y y ω t and η j x y t re η x e i μ y y ω t respectively for j 1 2 3 where μ y k 0 sin θ with k 0 being the wave number of the plane gravity wave thus the spatial velocity potential ϕ j x z for j 1 2 3 will satisfy the helmholtz equation given by 9 2 x 2 2 z 2 μ y 2 ϕ j 0 for j 1 2 3 along with the boundary conditions as in eqs 2 5 further using eq 1 the dynamic boundary condition as in eq 8 can be rewritten as following mohapatra et al 2013 10 d 4 z 4 q 2 z 2 m k 1 ϕ 2 z k ϕ 2 0 where d e i ρ g q n ρ g k ω 2 g and m ρ e d ρ further the continuity of pressure and velocity near the fluid structure interfaces at x 0 and x b yield 11 ϕ j 0 z ϕ 2 0 z ϕ j 0 z x ϕ 2 0 z x where j 1 at x 0 and j 3 at x b it is assumed that the edges of the floating plate are either free simply supported or clamped in the case of free edges the bending moment and shear force are zero on the edges and the conditions are given by 12 e i 2 x 2 ν μ y 2 ϕ 2 z 0 e i 2 x 2 2 ν μ y 2 x q x ϕ 2 z 0 at 0 0 and b 0 in the case of simply supported edges the deflection and bending moment of the plate are zero and the conditions are given by 13 ϕ 2 z 0 e i 2 x 2 ν μ y 2 ϕ 2 z 0 at 0 0 and b 0 while the plate deflection and slope of the plate deflection are zero in the case of clamped edges and the conditions are given by 14 ϕ 2 z 0 2 ϕ 2 x z 0 at 0 0 and b 0 finally the radiation condition for oblique wave scattering by a floating elastic plate over a porous bed yields 15 ϕ j x z i 0 e i q 0 x r 0 e i q 0 x f 0 k 0 z j 1 x t 0 e i q 0 x f 0 k 0 z j 3 x where i 0 is the known constant associated with the amplitude of the incident wave r 0 and t 0 are the unknown constants associated with the reflected and transmitted wave amplitudes respectively with q 0 k 0 2 μ y 2 and k 0 being the most predominant progressive wave number which is a complex number in general however in case of real g k 0 becomes a real positive number details about the roots of the dispersion relation will be discussed in the subsequent section 16 k 0 k 0 tanh k 0 h g k k 0 g tanh k 0 h further in eq 15 f 0 k 0 z is the eigenfunction associated with k 0 and is given by 17 f 0 k 0 z i g ω k 0 cosh k 0 h z g sinh k 0 h z cosh k 0 h g sinh k 0 h 2 2 method of solution the spatial velocity potentials in regions 1 2 and 3 satisfying the governing equation 9 along with the boundary conditions prescribed in eqs 2 5 and 15 are written as 18 ϕ j x z i 0 e i q 0 x f 0 k 0 z n 0 r n e i q n x f n k n z for x 0 j 1 n 0 a n e i q n x b n e i q n x b g n p n z for 0 x b j 2 n 0 t n e i q n x b f n k n z for x b j 3 where r n a n b n and t n for n 0 1 2 are unknown expansion coefficients to be determined with q n k n 2 μ y 2 and q n p n 2 μ y 2 and the eigenfunctions f n k n z and g n p n z are given by 19 f n k n z i g ω k n cosh k n h z g sinh k n h z cosh k n h g sinh k n h 20 g n p n z i g ω p n cosh p n h z g

covered region 2 the eigenvalues p n satisfy the dispersion relation 22 d p n 4 q p n 2 m k 1 p n 2 tanh p n h p n g k p n g tanh p n h the eigenfunctions in the open water regions f n k n z are orthonormal i e 23 0 h f n k n z f m k m z d z δ n m where δ n m is the kronecker delta however the vertical eigenfunctions in the plate covered region are not orthogonal as has been discussed by sahoo et al 2001 in the present study orthogonality of the eigenfunction in the open water regions are used to solve the boundary value problem it may be noted that for g 0 and q 0 the dispersion relation in eqs 21 and 22 reduce to the dispersion relations for the open water and plate covered regions respectively over a non porous bed as in maiti and mandal 2014 in the present work the nature of the roots of the dispersion relation in the open water and plate covered regions as given in eqs 21 and 22 are analyzed in fig 2 a and b using contour plots as has been performed by fox and squire 1990 for determining the roots of the dispersion equations in the open water and plate covered regions newton raphson method is used initial guess in the newton raphson method for each root is obtained using contour plot unlike gravity waves over a non porous bed fig 2 a reveals that the dispersion relation in eq 21 has two real roots k 0 further it has infinite many imaginary roots of opposite signs k n n 1 2 3 which imply the existence of evanescent modes of which only the first few roots are shown here on the other hand unlike flexural gravity wave motion over a non porous bed fig 2 b shows that the dispersion relation given in eq 22 has two real roots p 0 four complex roots p i p i i p i i i and p i v with p i p i v and p i i p i i i which are non propagating in nature there is a sequence of purely imaginary roots p n n 1 2 3 which also imply the existence of evanescent modes similar observations were made by maiti and mandal 2014 in the case of a porous bed and by fox and squire 1994 in the case of a non porous bed on the other hand fig 3 reveals that when the porous effect parameter g is complex all the roots of the dispersion relations in open water and plate covered regions are complex in nature and all the roots are in close proximity with the roots discussed in fig 2 and the forms of the velocity potentials will remain similar to that of the real valued g as in eq 18 moreover it may be noted that the roots of the dispersion relation which are close to the real axis are referred as the most predominant progressive wave modes as discussed in behera and sahoo 2014 these modes are considered in the radiation condition as in eq 15 to account for the wave motion in regions i and 3 next using the matching conditions at x 0 and x b as in eq 11 and the orthogonality of the eigenfunctions as defined in eq 23 and truncating the infinite sums after ℕ terms a system of 4 ℕ 4 equations for the determination of the unknowns associated with the velocity potentials in eq 18 are obtained as follows 24 ℕ n 0 r n x n m ℕ n 0 a n b n e i q n b y n m δ 0 m i 0 x 0 m 25 ℕ n 0 q n r n x n m ℕ n 0 q n a n b n e i q n b y n m δ 0 m q 0 i 0 x 0 m 26 ℕ n 0 t n x

that the edges of the floating elastic plate are simple supported thus using eq 13 four additional equations are obtained as follows 29 ℕ n 0 e n p n a n b n e i q n b 0 30 ℕ n 0 e n p n a n e i q n b

system of equations as given in eqs 24 27 and 29 32 will determine the unknown constants r n a n b n and t n similarly eqs 12 and 14 are used in the case of the floating plate having free or clamped edges respectively 2 3 numerical results and discussion in this subsection the effects of various wave and structural parameters such as bed porosity and plate characteristics are investigated in a homogeneous fluid of uniform density by analyzing the reflection and transmission coefficients which are computed using matlab programs these reflection and transmission coefficients will provide global information about the scattering and dissipation of wave energy by the floating plate in the presence of porous sea bed moreover the role of compressive force and bed porosity on the phase and group velocity is analyzed to understand the general characteristics of wave motion unless stated otherwise the following values of physical parameters are considered i 0 1 m h 5 m t 5 sec b h 6 g h 0 25 0 25 i g 9 81 m sec2 θ 20 ν 0 3 e 5 gpa d 0 1 m and n e i ρ g once the unknowns are determined the reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients can be easily computed using the formulae 34 k r r 0 i 0 k t t 0 i 0 and k d 1 k r 2 k t 2 in order to study the convergence of the infinite series numerical values of reflection coefficients k r are computed for different values of ℕ and illustrated table 1 for certain fixed values of k 0 h where ℕ 0 represents the progressive wave mode solution table 1 reveals that the numerical results converge up to 5 decimal accuracy for ℕ larger than 15 in fig 4 a and b the phase velocity ω p 0 and group velocity d ω d p 0 versus wave number p 0 are plotted respectively for different values of the porous effect parameter g h and compressive force n in case of flexural gravity wave motion over a porous bed fig 4 a reveals that for n 2 e i ρ g 1 2 zero phase velocity occurs in case of each g h this value of n is referred to as critical compressive force for which the frequency of the progressive wave vanishes as discussed in mohapatra et al 2013 in case of rigid bed however phase velocity decreases with an increase in the values of the porous effect parameter g h on the other hand from fig 4 b it is observed that the group velocity is negative for n 2 e i ρ g 1 2 which indicates that the wave crest and wave group move in opposite direction further for p 0 0 069 and n 2 e i ρ g 1 2 certain discontinuity in wave energy propagation is observed irrespective of g h and is similar to the observation made in mohanty et al 2014 for g h 0 which ensures that the value of the critical compressive force is unaltered in the presence of the sea bed porosity for critical compressive force n 2 e i ρ g 1 2 the group velocity does not exist mathematically see mohanty et al 2014 and buckling occurs under such circumstances this will lead to the discontinuity in the behavior of the propagation of flexural gravity waves similar observations were made by schulkes et al 1987 however for g h 0 the group velocity decreases with an increase in n below the critical compressive force limit this may be due to the fact that critical value of the compressive force is a plate characteristics while porous effect parameter is a characteristic of the sea bed the bed porosity will change the wave induced response not the structural characteristics of the floating plate thus in the present study the values of compressive force n is restricted to values below the critical compressive force in fig 5 a and b the reflection coefficient versus ω h g are plotted for different values of non dimensional plate length b h with θ 0 and 30 respectively in case of plate having free edge conditions both the figures reveals that the curves of reflection coefficients k r obtained by the present theory for rigid bed g h 0 are in close agreement with fig 2 of sturova 1999 moreover with an increase in non dimensional plate length b h the number of zeros in wave reflection increases a comparison between fig 5 a and b reveals that there is a decrease in the frequency of occurrence of zero reflection for oblique angle of incidence further for smaller plate length wave reflection is less for oblique angle of incidence in fig 6 a the reflection and transmission coefficients versus non dimensional plate length k 0 b are plotted for different edge conditions namely clamped simply supported and free edges fig 6 a reveals that the plate having clamped edges exhibits larger reflection and smaller transmission which indicates that a major part of the wave energy will be reflected in case of a clamped edge plate and thus less wave will transmit below the plate however plate having free edges exhibits smaller reflection and larger transmission compared to the other two types of edge conditions thus in case of a floating plate with free edge wave induced force on the floating plate will be more as more wave energy will transmit through the structure compared to that a plate having clamped or simply supported edge the dissipation coefficient versus k 0 b is plotted for different edge conditions in fig 6 b fig 6 b depicts that wave energy dissipates more with increase in plate length both the figures reveal that the reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients follow certain oscillatory pattern with an increase in the structural length moreover the study reveals that the amplitude of oscillation decrease with an increase in non dimensional length k 0 b as energy loss takes place by the porous bed as it is found that the plate having clamped edges results more reflection and less transmission clamped edge may be preferred as an effective edge condition hereafter all the numerical results in the manuscript are discussed for a floating plate having clamped edges in fig 7 a the reflection and transmission coefficients and b dissipation coefficients versus k 0 b are plotted for different values of the porous effect parameter g h fig 7 a reveals that in case of non porous bed g h 0 and real g h the reflection and transmission coefficients follow certain oscillatory pattern and zero reflection and full transmission observed periodically and satisfies the energy relation k 2 2 k t 2 1 on the other hand for complex values of the porous effect parameter g h k 2 2 k t 2 1 due to the dissipation of wave energy by the porous bed moreover in case of complex g h with an increase in non dimensional length of the plate k 0 b the amplitude of the oscillation of the reflection coefficient decreases uniformly with an increase in plate length the uniform decrease in wave reflection is due to the dissipation of wave energy by the porous sea bed moreover wave reflection and transmission decrease with an increase in the absolute value of g h in case of complex g h fig 7 b reveals that the dissipation coefficient k d increases with an increase in the absolute value of the porous effect parameter g h and plate length which is due to the dissipation of wave energy as it passes through the porous bed in fig 8 a and b the reflection and transmission coefficients versus non dimensional plate length k 0 b are plotted for different values of young s modulus of the floating plate e and compressive force n respectively fig 8 a depicts that the increase in young s modulus of the plate e results in an increase in the wave reflection but a decrease in the wave transmission the plate becomes more rigid with larger e i and therefore most of the waves which concentrate near the free surface are reflected back and in the process less wave energy is transmitted below the plate similar observations were made by sahoo et al 2001 and maiti and mandal 2014 in the case of wave scattering by a semi infinite plate over a porous non porous bed thus the plate having a moderate value of e are suitable as an effective coastal structure for wave attenuation on the other hand the wave reflection decreases and transmission increases with an increase in compressive force n as shown fig 8 b an increase in compressive force often enhances the structural deformation which result in the increase in the wave transmission and decrease in wave reflection within the critical limit this may be due to the decay in the rate of energy propagation by the floating plate with an increase in compressive force as observed in fig 4 in fig 9 a and b the reflection and transmission coefficients versus oblique angle θ are plotted for different values of the porous effect parameter g h and young s modulus e of the floating plate respectively fig 9 a reveals that zero reflection and full transmission occur for certain values of the angle of incidence θ in case of non porous bed g h 0 and real g h and this angle is said to be the critical angle which is similar to the observation found in behera et al 2013 and fox and squire 1994 however zero reflection and full transmission do not occur for complex g h on the other hand with an increase in the absolute value of the complex porous effect parameter there is an increase in the value of the angle of incidence for which wave reflection attends certain minimum which is due to the dissipation of wave energy by the porous bed fig 9 b depicts that the reflection coefficient increases with an increase in young s modulus e while an opposite pattern is observed in the transmission coefficient which is similar to be observation found in fig 8 a 3 wave scattering by a floating elastic plate in a two layer fluid system in this subsection the problem for wave scattering by a floating elastic plate in a two layer fluid over a porous bed is presented unlike the case of a single layer fluid due to the presence of the interface and the free surface and plate covered surface there exist two wave modes in each of the open water regions and plate covered region as discussed in behera et al 2013 and bhattacharjee and sahoo 2008 3 1 mathematical formulation in this case the fluid and structural characteristics are the same as have been considered in subsection 2 1 except that the fluid domain is occupied by two immiscible fluids having the mean interface at z h the upper and lower fluids are of finite depths 0 z h and h z h and constant densities ρ 1 and ρ 2 respectively as shown in fig 10 the velocity potentials φ j for j 1 2 3 satisfy eq 1 along with the boundary conditions 2 8 with ρ being replaced by ρ 1 further using the continuity of velocity and pressure at the interface the dynamic and boundary conditions at the mean interface at z h yield as in bhattacharjee and sahoo 2008 where ξ j for j 1 2 3 are the interface elevations in regions 1 2 3 respectively and s ρ 1 ρ 2 with 0 s 1 moreover the spatial velocity potential satisfy the helmholtz equation as in eq 9 along with the boundary conditions given in eqs 10 14 now the radiation condition for oblique wave scattering by a floating elastic plate in a two layer fluid over porous bed gives 37 ϕ j x z i i n i i n e i q n x r n e i q n x f n k n z j 1 x i i n i t n e i q n x f n k n z j 3 x where i n r n and t n for n i i i are constants associated with the incident reflected and transmitted wave amplitudes respectively in the surface and internal modes with q n k n 2 μ y 2 here k i and k i i are the complex wave numbers associated with the most predominant progressive waves surface mode sm and the internal mode im in the open water regions 1 and 3 respectively with f n k n z being the associated eigenfunctions details about the roots of the dispersion relation will be discussed in the subsequent section 3 2 method of solution for analyzing the role of wave motion in the two layer fluid domain it is assumed that the plane progressive flexural gravity waves in the surface and internal modes are of the forms η re η 0 e i p x ω t and ζ re ζ 0 e i p x ω t with η 0 and ζ 0 being the amplitudes of the flexural gravity waves in the surface and internal modes respectively using the governing equation 1 along with boundary conditions 2 4 and 35 36 the velocity potential can be written as 38 φ x z t i ω μ cosh p z sinh p z η p 0 z h i ω p cosh p h z g sinh p h z ζ p p sinh p h h g cosh p h h h z h where g is the porous effect parameter associated with the porous bed as discussed in section 2 and p is the wave number of the gravity waves in the plate covered region which satisfies the dispersion relation 39 k m p μ p d p 4 q p 2 1 in eq 39 μ is given by 40 μ s tanh p h l k 1 s p coth p h s coth p h l k 1 s p where 41 l p coth p h h g p g coth p h h also the ratio of the amplitudes of flexural gravity waves in the surface and internal modes is given by 42 η 0 ζ 0 s coth p h l k p 1 s s k an equivalent form of eq 39 is given by 43 u p k 2 v p k w p 0 where u p m p g s coth p h h m p s g coth p h 1 g m s coth p h h coth p h s g m v p p c g m 1 s coth p h h z coth p h g coth p h h coth p h p m 1 s g c w p p 2 c 1 s 1 g coth p h h with g g p z s c 1 1 c d p 4 q p 2 1 and m ρ s d ρ 1 on the other hand for d 0 q 0 and m 0 eqs 42 and 43 give the amplitude ratio and dispersion relation for the open water region in the presence of a porous bed and the dispersion relation in the open water region in terms of k is given by 44 u w k 2 v w k w w 0 where u w s coth k h h coth k h g s coth k h h coth k h v w k coth k h h coth k h g coth k h h coth k h 1 w w k 2 1 s 1 g coth k h h it may be noted that for g 0 and q 0 the dispersion relation in eqs 43 and 44 reduce to the dispersion relations for the open water and plate covered regions respectively in a two layer fluid over a non porous bed as in lin and lu 2013 further for q 0 s 1 and h h the dispersion relations in eqs 43 and 44 reduce to the corresponding dispersion relations in the case of a single layer fluid as given in eqs 21 and 22 respectively in a manner similar to that for a single layer fluid as described in subsection 2 1 the roots of the dispersion relations for open water and plate covered regions as given in eqs 43 and 44 are shown in fig 11 a and b respectively unlike gravity wave motion over a non porous bed fig 11 a reveals that the dispersion relation in eq 43 has two pairs of complex roots of opposite signs k i and k i i which are referred to as the wave numbers associated with the most predominant progressive waves in surface mode sm and internal mode im respectively further it has infinitely many complex roots which are close to the imaginary axis with opposite signs k n n 1 2 3 and correspond to the evanescent modes on the other hand unlike flexural gravity wave motion over an impermeable bed fig 11 b shows that the dispersion relation given in eq 44 has two pairs of complex roots of opposite signs p i and p i i and are referred to as the wave numbers associated with the most predominant progressive waves in the flexural gravity mode and internal mode and are very close to the real axis two pairs of complex roots of the forms p i i i p v i and p i v p v which are non propagating in nature and lies in the complex plane and there are a sequence of complex roots p n n 1 2 3 which are close to the imaginary axis and corresponds to the evanescent modes similar to behera and sahoo 2014 moreover similar observations were made by bhattacharjee and sahoo 2008 for a non porous bed where the wave number associated with the progressive wave mode is a real number and evanescent wave modes are purely imaginary numbers thus in a two layer fluid the forms of the spatial velocity potentials in regions 1 2 and 3 are given by 45 ϕ j x z ii n i i n e i q n x f n k n z n i ii 1 r n e i q n x f n k n z for x 0 j 1 n i ii 1 a n e i q n x b n e i q n x b g n p n z for 0 x b j 2 n i ii 1 t n e i q n x b f n k n z for x b j 3 where r n a n b n and t n for n i i i 1 2 are the unknown coefficients to be determined i n s are associated with the amplitudes of the incident waves in surface and internal modes and are assumed to be known moreover r n and t n for n i and i i are associated with the amplitudes of the reflected and transmitted waves in surface and internal modes respectively in eq 45 k n and p n are the roots of the dispersion relation as given in eqs 43 and 44 respectively with q n k n 2 μ y 2 and q n p n 2 μ y 2 further the eigenfunctions f n k n z and g n k n z are given by 46 f n k n z sinh k n h h g cosh k n h h k n sinh k n h k cosh k n h k n cosh k n z k sinh k n z 0 z h cosh k n h z g sinh k n h z h z h 47 g n p n z sinh p n h h g cosh p n h h p n c sinh p n h k cosh p n h p n c cosh p n z k p n z 0 z h cosh p n h z g sinh p n h z h z h where c c m k and c m and g are the same as those defined in eq 43 the eigenfunctions f n k n z in the open water region is integrable in 0 z h having a discontinuity at z h and are orthogonal with respect to the inner product defined by 48 f n k n z f m k m z s 0 h f n k n z f m k m z d z h h f n k n z f m k m z d z again in a manner similar to that in the case of a single layer fluid a system of equations for the determination of the unknowns associated with the velocity potentials in eq 45 are obtained as follows 49 ℕ n i i i 1 r n x n m ℕ n n i i i 1 a n b n e i q n b y n m i i n i δ n m i n x n m 50 ℕ n i i i 1 q n r n x n m ℕ n i i i 1 q n a n b n e i q n b y n m i i n i δ n m q n i n x

to satisfy one of the edge conditions namely free simply supported or built in edge in the context of the present section it is assumed that the plate is having simply supported edges thus using eq 13 four additional equations are obtained as below 55 ℕ n i i i 1 k e n p n a n b n e i q n b 0 56 ℕ n i i i 1 k e n p n a n e i q n b b n 0 57 ℕ n i i i 1 e i q n 2 ν μ y 2 k e n p n a n b n e i q n b 0

i i i 1 2 eqs 49 52 and 55 58 are solved similarly eqs 12 and 14 are used in the case of the floating plate having free and clamped edges respectively 3 3 numerical results and discussion in this case the depth ratio h h 0 2 density ratio s 0 75 and other parameters given in subsection 2 3 are kept fixed unless it is stated otherwise the reflection and transmission coefficients in sm and im can be easily computed using the formulae 60 k r i r i i i and k t i t i i i in sm k r i i r i i i i i and k t i i t i i i i i in im in fig 12 a and b the reflection and transmission coefficients versus oblique angle θ are plotted for waves in sm and im respectively for different values of the porous effect parameter g h fig 12 a depicts that with an increase in the absolute value of the porous effect parameter g h results lower reflection and transmission in sm further in sm zero reflection and full transmission occur for certain values of the angle of incidence θ in case of rigid bottom g h 0 and real g h similar observation is obtained for a homogeneous fluid as has been shown in fig 9 a moreover zero minimum in the reflection coefficient for waves in surface mode does not occur for complex porous effect parameter g h and the observation is similar to that of a homogeneous fluid moreover increasing absolute values of g h tends to shift the position of the minimum reflection for waves in sm fig 12 b depicts that with an increase in the oblique angle of incidence frequency of occurrence of zero wave reflection in internal mode increases and amplitude of oscillation in wave reflection increases with an increase in angle of incidence which may be due to the resonating interaction of the waves in surface and internal modes the maxima in wave reflection corresponds to the case of constructive interference while the minima corresponds to the case of destructive interference further the wave reflection and transmission decrease in im with an increase in the absolute values of g h the variations in wave reflection and transmission for waves in im compared to that in sm with an increase in the porous effect parameter is due to the fact that in a two layer fluid system the angle of incidence in surface mode and internal modes changes with stratification which follows snell s law of refraction in fig 13 a and b the reflection and transmission coefficients versus oblique angle θ are plotted for waves in sm and im respectively for different values of the depth ratio h h both the figures demonstrates that the general patterns in wave reflection and transmission are similar to those discussed above in fig 12 a and b owing to the higher wave energy concentration near the free surface the wave reflection is more and wave transmission is less in both sm and im when the interface is closer to the free surface similar observation was made by behera et al 2015 in the case of wave scattering by a partial porous structure in a two layer fluid fig 13 a depicts that with an increase in h h zero reflection and full transmission occur for lower values of oblique angle θ in fig 14 a and b the reflection and transmission coefficients versus oblique angle θ are plotted for waves in sm and im respectively for different values of the density ratio s from these figures it is observed that the reflection coefficient decreases while the transmission coefficient increases as the density ratio s increases this may be sue to the fact that as the density variation increases interfacial effect becomes more predominant and the role of waves in interface plays a significant role which obstruct the wave motion fig 14 b depicts that oscillatory patterns in wave reflection and transmission for waves in im increases with an increase in the density ratio s which is due to the mutual interaction between waves in surface and interface in fig 15 a and b the reflection and transmission coefficients versus oblique angle θ are plotted for waves in sm and im respectively for different values of young s modulus of the floating plate e from fig 15 a it is observed that the wave reflection increases while the wave transmission decreases with an increase in young s modulus of the plate e this is similar to the case of homogeneous fluid as has been seen in fig 7 b on the other hand fig 15 b depicts that the wave reflection decreases for im waves with an increase in e in fig 16 a and b the reflection and transmission coefficients versus oblique angle θ are plotted for waves in sm and im respectively for different values of compressive force n fig 16 a depicts that there are two times where minima of wave reflection occur in sm when compressive force tends to zero and 0 θ 90 while for larger values of compressive force n there is only one time where minimum of wave reflection occurs however the number of times where minima of reflection and maxima of transmission occur do not change with an increase in the compressive force as shown in fig 16 b for im waves generally k r i increases and k t i decreases as the compressive force increases while k r i i decreases and k t i i increases as the compressive force n increases in fig 17 a and b the reflection and transmission coefficients versus non dimensional plate length k i b are plotted for waves in sm and im respectively for different values of the porous effect parameter g h fig 17 a shows that both the wave reflection and transmission in sm decrease as a result of the increase in the absolute values of porous effect parameter g h moreover unlike the occurrence of multiple zeros in wave reflection for real value of porous effect parameter zero reflection does not occur for complex porous effect parameter g h with an increase in plate length k i b this is similar to that for homogeneous fluid as seen in fig 7 a on the other hand wave reflection increases and wave transmission decreases for waves in im with an increase in the absolute values of g h in the two layer fluid system since the total wave energy is conserved less energy concentration near the free surface corresponds to higher energy concentration at the interface thus due to the resonating interaction of the waves in sm and im waves in im becomes predominant and is reflected by the floating plate in fig 18 a and b the reflection and transmission coefficients versus non dimensional plate length k i b are plotted for waves in sm and im respectively for different values of the depth ratio h h the general patterns in wave reflection and transmission for sm and im waves are similar to those already observed in fig 17 a and b fig 18 a depicts that as the depth ratio h h increases the minima in the wave reflection for sm shifted to the left however fig 18 b depicts that for waves in im with an increase in h h the minima in the wave reflection shifted to the right from these figures it is observed that the amplitude of the oscillatory pattern of the reflection coefficient decreases with an increase in h h this is due to the concentration of higher amount of wave energy near the free surface as has been discussed in behera et al 2015 like the earlier discussion wave transmission follows an opposite trend to that of wave reflection for waves in sm and im in fig 19 a and b the reflection and transmission coefficients versus non dimensional plate length k i b are plotted for waves in sm and im respectively for different values of the density ratio s in general wave reflection decreases and the transmission increases for both sm and im waves with an increase in the density ratio s the patterns in wave reflection and transmission are more oscillatory in im when compared with that in sm the optimum wave reflection is due to the constructive interference while the minimum wave reflection is due to the destructive interference of the waves in sm and im moreover the increase in the frequency of occurrence of optimum wave reflection and transmission in im is due to the resonating interaction of the waves in surface and internal modes fig 19 b depicts that as with an increase in density ratio smaller wave reflection and nearly full transmission occur for waves in im with an increase in the density ratio the two fluid behaves like a single fluid and the role of the interface diminishes which results in the transmission of a major part of the wave energy with negligible reflection 4 conclusion in the present paper oblique wave scattering by a floating elastic plate over a porous bed is studied in single and two layer fluid systems the mathematical problems are formulated under the assumption of small amplitude waves and structural response and are solved using the eigenfunction expansion method numerical results are computed and discussed for the reflection and transmission coefficients to reveal effects due to the wave and structural parameters the computed results are validated by comparing with known results available in the literature in both the cases of a single and two layer fluids over a non porous bed inclusion of the resistance effect in the porous effect parameter leads to dissipation of global wave energy due to energy loss by porous sea bed a comparison for various types of edge conditions reveals that in case of a floating plate with free edge wave induced force on the floating plate will be more as more wave energy will transmit through the structure compared to that a plate having clamped or simply supported edge it is depicted that the critical compressive force for which wave celerity vanishes in the plate covered region is independent of the bed permeability however for g h 0 the group velocity decreases with an increase in the compressive force n below the critical compressive force limit the present study depicts that under particular conditions for some combinations of the wave and structural parameters zero reflection and full transmission may occur in case of rigid bottom and real g h for porous bed however for complex g h zero reflection and full transmission do not occur moreover in case of complex g h due the energy dissipation by porous bed wave transmission decreases significantly with increase in length of the floating plate further the study reveals that with an increase in the absolute values of the porous effect parameter of the porous bed both wave reflection and transmission decrease in both the case of single and two layer fluids the patterns in the wave reflection and transmission in the internal mode are more oscillatory when compared with that in the surface mode which is due to the resonating interaction of the waves in surface and interface modes due to the higher wave energy concentration near the free surface wave reflection is larger and wave transmission is hence lower for waves in either the surface or internal mode when the interface is closer to the free surface these findings will enhance the understanding of the wave energy distribution in a homogeneous and stratified fluid in oblique seas and will be of immense help in the design of floating breakwaters and other marine structures located on a porous sea bed the concept can be generalized to include the role of bottom undulation for dealing with wave structure interaction problems in the presence of porous bed

are protected by the headland the water exchange between the bay and the open sea is weakened which in some cases causes the deterioration of water quality and the bloom of algae and seaweed e g crowther et al 2001 fogarty et al 2003 jones and obiri danso 1998 xia et al 2000 especially for the part of water behind the artificial headlands to avoid the potential deterioration of water quality in artificial headland bays two alternative types of artificial headland detached artificial headland dah and submerged artificial headland sah have been proposed to improve the water exchange a detached headland is a headland with a tidal channel reserved in the landward end of it as illustrated in fig 1 a the detached headland blocks a large part of wave while it allows the water to flow in and out of the headland bay through the tidal channel a submerged headland is a low crested structure lcs with the crest level lower than mean sea level msl as illustrated in fig 1 b the submerged headland can induce significant wave energy dissipation while it allows the tidal flow to get through and refresh the water behind it pan et al 2014 studied the effects of the reserved tidal channel in an artificial headland by involving the tidal channel the concept of dah was proposed implicitly and its effects on the beach protection and water exchange were discussed it has been found that the tidal channel largely improves the water exchange at the cost of an acceptable loss of beach protection however the tidal channel would induce large flow velocity in some cases which may induce local scour using a submerged headland may be an alternative scheme of tidal channel in this paper the concepts of sah and dah are given and their effects in beach nourishment are compared in the aspect of beach protection and water exchange a shoreline change model and a constituent transport model are set up to investigate the performance of sah and dah in a beach nourishment projects the models are verified by field surveys and then different project schemes are simulated to compare the performance of sah and dah in beach protection and water exchange 2 study area west beach situated in beidaihe district in qinhuangdao is a 3 2 km long embayed beach bounded on either extremity by relatively short headlands as shown in fig 2 at the west end of the beach a groin is constructed to guide the waterway of a small harbour while the east end of the beach has a natural cape west beach is a low energy beach exposed to small waves an analysis of wave measurement from 2011 to 2014 indicates that most of the waves come from the s to ese direction the predominant wave direction is the se direction accounting for 21 72 of all waves most of the recorded significant wave heights h s about 91 23 of all data are smaller than 0 6 m and only 1 01 of the recorded significant wave heights are larger than 0 9 m the average wave period t s is 4 5 s west beach is located near an amphidromic point experiencing a regular diurnal tide with multiannual average tidal rang of 0 74 m before the beach nourishment the west beach was subjected to beach erosion due to river damming upstream in nearby rivers and sand quarrying in the estuary therefore decision was made to initiate a beach nourishment project to protect and enlarge the west beach a two phase beach nourishment project was conducted as illustrated in fig 2 the first phase phase i carried out in may and june 2008 nourished only part of the west beach with the construction of a nearshore sandbar and a submerged breakwater after the trial project the monitoring of beach profiles was conducted along the eight profiles as shown in fig 2 to provide needed post nourishment data for model verification the second phase phase ii covering the whole west beach with a 50 m wide beach fill was conducted in november to december 2010 the median grain size of the borrowed sand ranged between 0 42 and 0 61 mm while the median grain size of native beach was 0 34 mm the designed beach slope was 1 10 above low water level and 1 8 below low water level designed berm height was 3 m and sand fill volume was 2 567 106 m3 with an overfill factor 1 12 as calculated according to the coastal engineering manual usace 2002 three detached submerged breakwaters and two artificial headlands were constructed at both ends of the beach the submerged breakwaters were constructed in 4 m depth about 450 m offshore with lengths of about 250 m and crest levels of 1 2 m below the mean sea level 3 shoreline change a shoreline change model is set up to study the effects of sah and dah on shoreline changes six cases with different conditions of artificial headland are simulated and the effects of submerged and detached headland are then discussed 3 1 model setup and verification the tools to predict beach evolution can be categorized into two classes analysis model and process based model analysis model on beach evolution usually refers to one line model based on the longshore transport due to wave breaking one line model cannot reflect profile evolution and needs field data to calibrate the model parameters to get good results but it has advantages in simulation of long term shoreline change and structure response evolution many shoreline change models are developed based on one line model e g genesis model of coastal engineering research center cerc unibest cl model of delft hydraulics litpack model of dhi etc process based model simulated the storm process and calculate the sand transport directly one of the most well known process based models is the xbeach model roelvink et al 2009 which considers the effects of wave propagation long waves and sediment transport on the morphological changes of beaches however the xbeach model is a storm response model and adopts to short term problems in this study the major concern is the long term responses of shoreline to sah and dah on which the one line model has good performance in addition the post nourishment surveys after the phase i of the project provide enough data for model calibration hence one line model is used to setup the shoreline change model genesis model is one of the widely used one line model developed by cerc hanson and kraus 1989 genesis model has been shown to be capable of reproducing shoreline changes resulting from coastal structures chu et al 1987 hanson et al 1988 1989 and it has been employed in the beach nourishment project around the world e g lee et al 2008 kuang et al 2010 nairn et al 1998 ravens and sitanggang 2007 gravens et al 1991 provided detailed information concerning the application of the genesis model the governing equation is given as 1 d y d t 1 d b d c q x 0 where x indicates the distance alongshore y indicates the distance offshore d b is the berm height d c is the closure depth and q is the longshore sand transport rate which is given by 2 q h s 2 c g b a 1 sin 2 θ b s a 2 cos θ b s h s x b where h s is the significant wave height c g is the wave group speed given by linear wave theory b is the subscript denoting the wave breaking condition and θ bs is the angle of breaking waves to the local shoreline the non dimensional parameters a 1 and a 2 can be calculated by two calibration parameters k 1 and k 2 respectively hanson et al 1989 the computational domain covers the whole west beach the detailed model setup is the berm height d b 2 m based on the profile measurement the closure depth d c 7 m according to previous study on sand transport of this area and k 1 2k 2 0 76 calibrated in model sensitivity study kuang et al 2011 in the modeling of the phase i project the initial shoreline and the arrangement of the artificial headland and submerged breakwaters are set up as in fig 2 the median grain size d 50 0 40 mm is used for both filled sand and local sand the 8 month shoreline changes after the phase i of the project were simulated and compared to the measurements as verification the beach elevations were measured along 8 profiles as shown in fig 2 in the monitoring profiles the distances between two adjacent measure points were less than 5 m in the area where the water depth was less than 1 5 m the elevations were measured with total stations gts 102n while in the other area the elevations were measured with echo sounders hd30 after the phase i project the measurements were taken twice a month the measured shoreline positions were obtained from the measurements of the 8 monitoring profiles the comparisons of the simulated and measured shoreline changes in 4 months and 8 months after project completion are shown in fig 3 the origin of the x axis is at the p8 profile as indicated in fig 2 and the 8 measured points from left to right indicate the shoreline positions at profile p8 to p1 respectively the good agreements achieved provide confidence that the model can be applied for the modeling of the phase ii project of west beach more details of the model verification can be found in the simulation of the phase i project kuang et al 2010 3 2 simulated cases with the verified shoreline change model cases with different artificial headland conditions are designed and 10 year shoreline changes after phase ii project are simulated under each case the key parameter that controls the beach protection performance of sah is the wave transmission coefficient k t defined as the ratio of the incident wave height directly shoreward of the breakwater to the wave height directly seaward of the breakwater e g k t of a tah is 0 and k t under no artificial headland condition is 1 the transmission coefficients can be estimated by empirical formulae e g buccino and calabrese 2007 d angremond et al 1996 seabrook and hall 1998 tomasicchio and d alessandro 2013 wamsley and ahrens 2003 these five empirical formulae get similar estimations and an average value of them is taken in this study the key parameter that controls the beach protection performance of dah is the proportion of tidal channel p tc defined as the ratio of the length of tidal channel to the total length of the detached headland including the tidal channel itself e g p tc of a tah is 0 and p tc under no artificial headland condition is 1 according to the key parameters six cases with different artificial headland conditions are simulated to investigate the performance of sah and dah in beach protection the cases are listed in table 1 case 1 and 6 are control cases to show the shoreline changes with tah and no artificial headlands nah case 2 and 3 are simulated to see the effects of sah and case 4 and 5 are simulated to see the effects of dah 3 3 results and discussion the simulated shoreline changes of the 6 cases are plotted in fig 4 the shoreline change indicates the relative change of the shoreline position compared to pre nourishment shoreline position a positive value means an increase of the beach width fig 4 a shows the results of sah cases and fig 4 b shows the results of dah cases the simulated results of tah and nah are also plotted for the purpose of comparison five major salients of the shoreline can be found for all cases those three salients in the middle of the beach are due to the three offshore submerged breakwaters and will not be discussed in this paper the salients at both ends of the beach are induced by the artificial headlands and their scales are influenced by the structural style and parameters of the artificial headlands both the sah and dah have good performance in protecting the beach behind them as seen in fig 4 when the k t or p tc equals 0 3 the shoreline changes are very close to those under tah case with the k t or p tc increasing to 0 5 the beach behind the artificial headlands is obvious wider than that in the case without artificial headlands hence it is feasible to use sah and dah instead of tah to protect the beach with the k t or p tc smaller than 0 5 the performance of sah or dah is close to tah from the point of view of beach protection by a comparison of fig 4 a and b it can be found that generally the sah forms smoother shoreline shape than the dah behind the tidal channels of the dahs the shoreline retreats significantly while behind the sahs the shoreline has a smoother shape smoother shoreline behind the artificial headlands is beneficial for tourism landscape it can also be found that the sensitivities of the shoreline changes to k t and p tc is different in the west and east end of the beach which can be explained by the state of the beach before nourishment according to kuang et al 2011 the beach experiences an east to west longshore sediment transport and as a result the west end of the beach is in silted condition despite of the eroded condition of the beach in the east end of the beach where it is in eroded condition the change of shoreline is sensitive to the change of k t and p tc with the increase of k t and p tc the beach width keeps decreasing in the west end of the beach where it is in silted condition the beach width shows different sensitivities to k t and p tc for the sah cases the shoreline changes under the cases of k t 0 and 0 3 are very close to each other in the west end of the beach in the case of k t 0 5 the beach behind the artificial headlands is narrower than that in the cases of k t 0 and 0 3 but still obviously wider than that in the case without the headlands the response of the shoreline change can be explained by that the effect of small partial transmission of waves on silted beach is negligible hence using a sah with a small k t in silted condition loses little beach protection effect for the dah cases the shoreline changes in the west end of the beach under the cases of p tc 0 3 and 0 5 are very close to each other and between the results of the cases of tah and nah one possible explanation is that the key effect of the landward end of an artificial breakwater in a silted condition is the blocking of longshore transport with the reservation of tidal channel in the dah the longshore transport can get through hence as if the tidal channel is long enough to enable the major part of longshore transport the length of tidal channel or the value of p tc has little influence on the shoreline shape behind 4 water exchange a constituent transport model is set up to study the effects of dah and sah on water exchanges six cases of tidal flow fields are simulated based on the simulated flow fields forty eight cases of constituent transport are simulated flushing times of the areas behind the artificial headlands are calculated according the simulated results of constituent transport the effects of sah and dah on water exchange are then discussed 4 1 model setup and verification the constituent transport model is set up based on the delft3d package which is an open source model system that consists of several integrated models e g delft3d flow and delft waq delft3d water quality model lesser et al 2004 the delft3d package has been utilized to in hydrodynamic and water quality simulations around the world e g bouma et al 2007 hartog et al 2008 lee and qu 2004 van dongeren et al 2008 the constituent transport model contains two parts the flow model and the transport model the flow model is set up based on the delft3d flow and verified by the comparison between simulated and measured water levels flow velocities and flow directions the transport model is set up based on the delft waq and driven by the simulated results of the flow model and provides concentration fields which are needed in the calculation of flushing times a four level orthogonal curvilinear grid system is set up as shown in fig 5 the level 1 grid covers the whole bohai sea to ensure a correct tidal flow field the two level 4 grids covering the west and east ends of the beach respectively provide the highest spatial resolution to represent the shape of the artificial headlands the level 2 and 3 grids are as intermediate the connections between the grids are implemented using the dd boundary domain decomposition boundary technology deltares 2010 by which the parameters can propagate through the internal boundaries smoothly the sizes of the level 1 2 3 grids and two level 4 grids for west and east end of the beach are 253 145 118 73 181 85 31 31 and 64 55 respectively considering that the water depth in the headland bay is relative shallow less than 4 m and in a large area outside the bay the water depth is less than 6 m five layers are adopted in the vertical dimension σ co ordinate to account the flow and concentration stratification in the water the offshore bathymetry is taken from bathymetric chart of bohai sea and the nearshore bathymetry in the scale of the level 3 grid is from the measurement of qinhuangdao mineral resource and hydrogeological brigade a field data collection including hourly measurements of flow velocity and direction at five stations in the sea area around west beach was conducted from 1100 may 20 to 1100 may 21 2011 to support model verification the locations of the five stations i e ob1 ob5 are as shown in fig 5 at ob1 to ob4 the flow velocity and direction were measured at 3 10 and 7 10 of the total water depth at ob5 the flow velocity and direction were only measured at mid depth the measurements of water level at a nearshore station station wl as shown in fig 5 during may 16 to 17 and may 20 to 21 were also used to verify the model the flow model was run from may 11 2011 to may 25 2011 during which field measurement data were available to verify the model the time step was set as 15 s the open boundary located through the bohai strait and the open boundary condition was given based on the tidal tables of dalian and yantai fig 5 provided by national marine data and information service of china the discharge of daihe river was treated as a constant discharge the value of which was given according to the multiannual average flow of daihe river of 1 62 m3 s the comparison between model simulations and observations of flow velocity and direction at represented stations ob3 and ob5 are given in fig 6 a and b respectively the comparisons between model simulations and observations of water levels at station wl is given in fig 6 c as seen good agreement can be found between model simulations and observations for flow velocity flow direction and water level which indicates that the flow model provides satisfactory descriptions of the tidal flow field in the modeled area 4 2 flushing time flushing time indicating the time scale of water exchange of a water body is widely used in assessment of water quality of estuaries e g alber and sheldon 1999 brooks et al 1999 guo and lordi 2000 huang et al 2011 miller and mcpherson 1991 bays e g abdelrhman 2005 choi and lee 2004 huang and spaulding 2002 liu et al 2004 pilson 1985 and other water bodies e g wang et al 2007 in this study the flushing time is defined as the time required for the mass of a conservative constituent which can be diluted but doesn t degrade in the water body reducing to a given percent of its initial mass the given percent namely cut off percentage was taken as 10 in huang et al 2011 and 1 e in abdelrhman 2005 and asselin and spaulding 1993 considering that the study area of this study is a relative open bay with short headlands and consequently the water exchange is relative fast 10 is chosen to be the cut off percentage to calculate the flushing time for estimating the flushing time of a particular area a unit tracer concentration is prescribed initially inside the area in a model and the transport of this mass is then calculated and the time variation of the tracer mass m t inside the calculated area is tracked the time required for reducing the tracer mass m t to 10 of the initial mass m0 is defined as the flushing time 4 3 simulated cases to investigate the influences of the dah and sah on the flushing time in different conditions 6 cases of tidal flow and 48 cases of constituent transport are simulated all the cases of tidal flow are run from may 11 2011 to may 25 2011 which is long enough to cover a spring tide and a neap tide the artificial headland conditions of the 6 cases are as listed in table 2 driven by the simulated results of the 6 cases of the flow model 48 case of constituent transport are simulated by the transport model to investigate the water exchange in different conditions of artificial headlands calculated areas and tidal conditions each simulated tidal flow field drives 8 constituent transport cases of 2 different calculation areas and 4 tidal conditions the two areas behind the artificial headlands as shown in fig 7 are selected as the calculation areas for the flushing time four tidal conditions including spring flood starting at 11 00 may 19 2011 spring ebb starting at 03 30 may 20 2011 neap flood starting at 05 00 may 14 2011 and neap ebb starting at 00 00 may 15 2011 as illustrated in fig 8 are chosen as the calculated tidal condition to study the effects of tidal condition to water exchange the simulated cases of the tidal flow and constituent transport are listed in table 2 for each case a unit tracer concentration is initially prescribed inside the studied area area 1 or area 2 and during the simulated time the time variation of the tracer mass inside the studied area is tracked 4 4 results and discussion the tracer mass reduction curves under different cases are given in fig 9 for area 1 and fig 10 for area 2 the curves with symbols represent the reduction history of the mean value of the fractions of the tracer mass under the same headland condition but different tidal conditions spring flood spring ebb neap flood and neap ebb while the vertical lines show the ranges of the fractions of the tracer mass under different tidal conditions as seen in figs 9 and 10 the tracer mass reduction curves under sah and dah cases are generally in between those of tah and nah cases the reduction rates of the tracer concentration increase with the increase of k t and p tc under sah and dah conditions respectively although with little differences when k t p tc the sah and dah cases have similar tracer mass reduction curves tidal conditions also have some influence on the tracer mass reduction process as indicated by the vertical lines in figs 9 and 10 representing the ranges of the fractions of the tracer mass due to the differences in tidal phases in order to have a direct comparison among the cases flushing times are calculated according to the tracer mass reduction curves when the tracer mass m t decreased to 10 of the initial mass m0 the calculated flushing times are plotter in fig 11 as seen the flushing times of sah and dah cases are obviously smaller than those of tah cases smaller values of k t and p tc induces larger flushing times e g the cases with k t and p tc equaling 0 3 have larger flushing times than those cases with k t and p tc equaling 0 5 the tidal phases have obvious influence on the flushing times as seen area 1 has longer flushing time in flood tides while area 2 has longer flushing time under ebb tides in particular the flushing times of area 2 are obviously longer under ebb conditions for both sah and dah cases in area 2 the flushing times under ebb tides are significantly longer than those under flood tides which can be explained by the tidal current directions the tidal current direction near the west beach is approximately parallel to the shoreline with a west to east direction under ebb condition and an east to west direction under flood condition under ebb tides the tidal flow direction is towards the open side of area 2 however due to low tidal levels under ebb tides the outlet flow over sah and through the channel of dah is weakened as a result a low velocity less than 0 01 m s area is formed behind the artificial headland as shown in fig 12 on the contrary although in flood tides the flow direction is east to west and towards the open side of area 1 the high tidal level ensures better flow out capabilities through sah or dah this explains why in area 1 the flushing times are longer in flood tides but the differences are not as significant in ebb tides 5 conclusions in this study the performance of sah and dah in a beach nourishment project is investigated and compared via numerical models the effects of sah and dah to shoreline change and water exchange are considered the results of this research provide references to improve the water exchange for the beach nourishment projects with artificial headlands to be constructed both the sah and dah have good performance in protecting the beach behind them when the k t or p tc equals 0 3 and 0 5 which are common used values for sah and dah hence it is feasible to use either sah or dah instead of tah to protect the beach comparison between the simulated shorelines of sah and dah cases shows that sah generates smoother shoreline shape which is beneficial for tourism landscape the eroding and silting characteristics of beach also has some effect on the performance of sah and dah under eroded condition the sensitivities of the shoreline to k t and p tc are similar while under silted condition the sah seems to have slightly better performance the water exchange conditions of the area behind the artificial headland under sah and dah cases are generally in between those of tah and nah cases with similar tracer mass reduction curves when k t and p tc have the same value the tidal condition has some influences on the flushing time of certain cases generally the sah and dah reduce the flushing time significantly compared to tah case in the tested ranges of k t and p tc e g in area 1 in the west beach the flushing times of sah cases with k t 0 3 and 0 5 and dah cases with p tc 0 3 and 0 5 are approximate 45 5 55 9 48 2 53 3 smaller than that of tah case in area 2 in the west beach the flushing times of sah cases with k t 0 3 and 0 5 and dah cases with p tc 0 3 and 0 5 are approximate 27 3 36 9 14 8 41 0 smaller than that of tah case generally speaking the using of both sah and dah are alternative measures of tah to improve the water exchange at the cost of an acceptable loss of beach protection performance the sah has some advantages in getting smooth shoreline shape and better performance under silted condition from the point of view of shoreline change the sah and dah have similar performance of strengthen the water exchange in the shadow zone actually in the nourishment project of the west beach the finally adopted scheme is a combination of sah and dah with k t 0 3 and p tc 0 5 and post nourishment survey shows that considerable widths of beach have been maintained at both ends of the west beach the information and insight gained from this study serve the beach nourishment in artificial headland bays to strengthen the water exchange and reduce the risk of water quality deterioration the conclusions of this paper are based on the case study on the west beach the conclusions are applicable to beaches of similar conditions i e sandy beaches with low wave energy and small tidal range however the sah and dah may also be used on other types of beaches but feasibility study and scheme comparison are needed before application of them acknowledgements the authors want to thank the supports from the national key r d program of china 2016yfc0401505 and the

district in qinhuangdao is a 3 2 km long embayed beach bounded on either extremity by relatively short headlands as shown in fig 2 at the west end of the beach a groin is constructed to guide the waterway of a small harbour while the east end of the beach has a natural cape west beach is a low energy beach exposed to small waves an analysis of wave measurement from 2011 to 2014 indicates that most of the waves come from the s to ese direction the predominant wave direction is the se direction accounting for 21 72 of all waves most of the recorded significant wave heights h s about 91 23 of all data are smaller than 0 6 m and only 1 01 of the recorded significant wave heights are larger than 0 9 m the average wave period t s is 4 5 s west beach is located near an amphidromic point experiencing a regular diurnal tide with multiannual average tidal rang of 0 74 m before the beach nourishment the west beach was subjected to beach erosion due to river damming upstream in nearby rivers and sand quarrying in the estuary therefore decision was made to initiate a beach nourishment project to protect and enlarge the west beach a two phase beach nourishment project was conducted as illustrated in fig 2 the first phase phase i carried out in may and june 2008 nourished only part of the west beach with the construction of a nearshore sandbar and a submerged breakwater after the trial project the monitoring of beach profiles was conducted along the eight profiles as shown in fig 2 to provide needed post nourishment data for model verification the second phase phase ii covering the whole west beach with a 50 m wide beach fill was conducted in november to december 2010 the median grain size of the borrowed sand ranged between 0 42 and 0 61 mm while the median grain size of native beach was 0 34 mm the designed beach slope was 1 10 above low water level and 1 8 below low water level designed berm height was 3 m and sand fill volume was 2 567 106 m3 with an overfill factor 1 12 as calculated according to the coastal engineering manual usace 2002 three detached submerged breakwaters and two artificial headlands were constructed at both ends of the beach the submerged breakwaters were constructed in 4 m depth about 450 m offshore with lengths of about 250 m and crest levels of 1 2 m below the mean sea level 3 shoreline change a shoreline change model is set up to study the effects of sah and dah on shoreline changes six cases with different conditions of artificial headland are simulated and the effects of submerged and detached headland are then discussed 3 1 model setup and verification the tools to predict beach evolution can be categorized into two classes analysis model and process based model analysis model on beach evolution usually refers to one line model based on the longshore transport due to wave breaking one line model cannot reflect profile evolution and needs field data to calibrate the model parameters to get good results but it has advantages in simulation of long term shoreline change and structure response evolution many shoreline change models are developed based on one line model e g genesis model of coastal engineering research center cerc unibest cl model of delft hydraulics litpack model of dhi etc process based model simulated the storm process and calculate the sand transport directly one of the most well known process based models is the xbeach model roelvink et al 2009 which considers the effects of wave propagation long waves and sediment transport on the morphological changes of beaches however the xbeach model is a storm response model and adopts to short term problems in this study the major concern is the long term responses of shoreline to sah and dah on which the one line model has good performance in addition the post nourishment surveys after the phase i of the project provide enough data for model calibration hence one line model is used to setup the shoreline change model genesis model is one of the widely used one line model developed by cerc hanson and kraus 1989 genesis model has been shown to be capable of reproducing shoreline changes resulting from coastal structures chu et al 1987 hanson et al 1988 1989 and it has been employed in the beach nourishment project around the world e g lee et al 2008 kuang et al 2010 nairn et al 1998 ravens and sitanggang 2007 gravens et al 1991 provided detailed information concerning the application of the genesis model the governing equation is given as 1 d y d t 1 d b d c q x 0 where x indicates the distance alongshore y indicates the distance offshore d b is the berm height d c is the closure depth and q is the longshore sand transport rate which is given by 2 q h s 2 c g b a 1 sin 2 θ b s a 2 cos θ b s h s x b where h s is the significant wave height c g is the wave group speed given by linear wave theory b is the subscript denoting the wave breaking condition and θ bs is the angle of breaking waves to the local shoreline the non dimensional parameters a 1 and a 2 can be calculated by two calibration parameters k 1 and k 2 respectively hanson et al 1989 the computational domain covers the whole west beach the detailed model setup is the berm height d b 2 m based on the profile measurement the closure depth d c 7 m according to previous study on sand transport of this area and k 1 2k 2 0 76 calibrated in model sensitivity study kuang et al 2011 in the modeling of the phase i project the initial shoreline and the arrangement of the artificial headland and submerged breakwaters are set up as in fig 2 the median grain size d 50 0 40 mm is used for both filled sand and local sand the 8 month shoreline changes after the phase i of the project were simulated and compared to the measurements as verification the beach elevations were measured along 8 profiles as shown in fig 2 in the monitoring profiles the distances between two adjacent measure points were less than 5 m in the area where the water depth was less than 1 5 m the elevations were measured with total stations gts 102n while in the other area the elevations were measured with echo sounders hd30 after the phase i project the measurements were taken twice a month the measured shoreline positions were obtained from the measurements of the 8 monitoring profiles the comparisons of the simulated and measured shoreline changes in 4 months and 8 months after project completion are shown in fig 3 the origin of the x axis is at the p8 profile as indicated in fig 2 and the 8 measured points from left to right indicate the shoreline positions at profile p8 to p1 respectively the good agreements achieved provide confidence that the model can be applied for the modeling of the phase ii project of west beach more details of the model verification can be found in the simulation of the phase i project kuang et al 2010 3 2 simulated cases with the verified shoreline change model cases with different artificial headland conditions are designed and 10 year shoreline changes after phase ii project are simulated under each case the key parameter that controls the beach protection performance of sah is the wave transmission coefficient k t defined as the ratio of the incident wave height directly shoreward of the breakwater to the wave height directly seaward of the breakwater e g k t of a tah is 0 and k t under no artificial headland condition is 1 the transmission coefficients can be estimated by empirical formulae e g buccino and calabrese 2007 d angremond et al 1996 seabrook and hall 1998 tomasicchio and d alessandro 2013 wamsley and ahrens 2003 these five empirical formulae get similar estimations and an average value of them is taken in this study the key parameter that controls the beach protection performance of dah is the proportion of tidal channel p tc defined as the ratio of the length of tidal channel to the total length of the detached headland including the tidal channel itself e g p tc of a tah is 0 and p tc under no artificial headland condition is 1 according to the key parameters six cases with different artificial headland conditions are simulated to investigate the performance of sah and dah in beach protection the cases are listed in table 1 case 1 and 6 are control cases to show the shoreline changes with tah and no artificial headlands nah case 2 and 3 are simulated to see the effects of sah and case 4 and 5 are simulated to see the effects of dah 3 3 results and discussion the simulated shoreline changes of the 6 cases are plotted in fig 4 the shoreline change indicates the relative change of the shoreline position compared to pre nourishment shoreline position a positive value means an increase of the beach width fig 4 a shows the results of sah cases and fig 4 b shows the results of dah cases the simulated results of tah and nah are also plotted for the purpose of comparison five major salients of the shoreline can be found for all cases those three salients in the middle of the beach are due to the three offshore submerged breakwaters and will not be discussed in this paper the salients at both ends of the beach are induced by the artificial headlands and their scales are influenced by the structural style and parameters of the artificial headlands both the sah and dah have good performance in protecting the beach behind them as seen in fig 4 when the k t or p tc equals 0 3 the shoreline changes are very close to those under tah case with the k t or p tc increasing to 0 5 the beach behind the artificial headlands is obvious wider than that in the case without artificial headlands hence it is feasible to use sah and dah instead of tah to protect the beach with the k t or p tc smaller than 0 5 the performance of sah or dah is close to tah from the point of view of beach protection by a comparison of fig 4 a and b it can be found that generally the sah forms smoother shoreline shape than the dah behind the tidal channels of the dahs the shoreline retreats significantly while behind the sahs the shoreline has a smoother shape smoother shoreline behind the artificial headlands is beneficial for tourism landscape it can also be found that the sensitivities of the shoreline changes to k t and p tc is different in the west and east end of the beach which can be explained by the state of the beach before nourishment according to kuang et al 2011 the beach experiences an east to west longshore sediment transport and as a result the west end of the beach is in silted condition despite of the eroded condition of the beach in the east end of the beach where it is in eroded condition the change of shoreline is sensitive to the change of k t and p tc with the increase of k t and p tc the beach width keeps decreasing in the west end of the beach where it is in silted condition the beach width shows different sensitivities to k t and p tc for the sah cases the shoreline changes under the cases of k t 0 and 0 3 are very close to each other in the west end of the beach in the case of k t 0 5 the beach behind the artificial headlands is narrower than that in the cases of k t 0 and 0 3 but still obviously wider than that in the case without the headlands the response of the shoreline change can be explained by that the effect of small partial transmission of waves on silted beach is negligible hence using a sah with a small k t in silted condition loses little beach protection effect for the dah cases the shoreline changes in the west end of the beach under the cases of p tc 0 3 and 0 5 are very close to each other and between the results of the cases of tah and nah one possible explanation is that the key effect of the landward end of an artificial breakwater in a silted condition is the blocking of longshore transport with the reservation of tidal channel in the dah the longshore transport can get through hence as if the tidal channel is long enough to enable the major part of longshore transport the length of tidal channel or the value of p tc has little influence on the shoreline shape behind 4 water exchange a constituent transport model is set up to study the effects of dah and sah on water exchanges six cases of tidal flow fields are simulated based on the simulated flow fields forty eight cases of constituent transport are simulated flushing times of the areas behind the artificial headlands are calculated according the simulated results of constituent transport the effects of sah and dah on water exchange are then discussed 4 1 model setup and verification the constituent transport model is set up based on the delft3d package which is an open source model system that consists of several integrated models e g delft3d flow and delft waq delft3d water quality model lesser et al 2004 the delft3d package has been utilized to in hydrodynamic and water quality simulations around the world e g bouma et al 2007 hartog et al 2008 lee and qu 2004 van dongeren et al 2008 the constituent transport model contains two parts the flow model and the transport model the flow model is set up based on the delft3d flow and verified by the comparison between simulated and measured water levels flow velocities and flow directions the transport model is set up based on the delft waq and driven by the simulated results of the flow model and provides concentration fields which are needed in the calculation of flushing times a four level orthogonal curvilinear grid system is set up as shown in fig 5 the level 1 grid covers the whole bohai sea to ensure a correct tidal flow field the two level 4 grids covering the west and east ends of the beach respectively provide the highest spatial resolution to represent the shape of the artificial headlands the level 2 and 3 grids are as intermediate the connections between the grids are implemented using the dd boundary domain decomposition boundary technology deltares 2010 by which the parameters can propagate through the internal boundaries smoothly the sizes of the level 1 2 3 grids and two level 4 grids for west and east end of the beach are 253 145 118 73 181 85 31 31 and 64 55 respectively considering that the water depth in the headland bay is relative shallow less than 4 m and in a large area outside the bay the water depth is less than 6 m five layers are adopted in the vertical dimension σ co ordinate to account the flow and concentration stratification in the water the offshore bathymetry is taken from bathymetric chart of bohai sea and the nearshore bathymetry in the scale of the level 3 grid is from the measurement of qinhuangdao mineral resource and hydrogeological brigade a field data collection including hourly measurements of flow velocity and direction at five stations in the sea area around west beach was conducted from 1100 may 20 to 1100 may 21 2011 to support model verification the locations of the five stations i e ob1 ob5 are as shown in fig 5 at ob1 to ob4 the flow velocity and direction were measured at 3 10 and 7 10 of the total water depth at ob5 the flow velocity and direction were only measured at mid depth the measurements of water level at a nearshore station station wl as shown in fig 5 during may 16 to 17 and may 20 to 21 were also used to verify the model the flow model was run from may 11 2011 to may 25 2011 during which field measurement data were available to verify the model the time step was set as 15 s the open boundary located through the bohai strait and the open boundary condition was given based on the tidal tables of dalian and yantai fig 5 provided by national marine data and information service of china the discharge of daihe river was treated as a constant discharge the value of which was given according to the multiannual average flow of daihe river of 1 62 m3 s the comparison between model simulations and observations of flow velocity and direction at represented stations ob3 and ob5 are given in fig 6 a and b respectively the comparisons between model simulations and observations of water levels at station wl is given in fig 6 c as seen good agreement can be found between model simulations and observations for flow velocity flow direction and water level which indicates that the flow model provides satisfactory descriptions of the tidal flow field in the modeled area 4 2 flushing time flushing time indicating the time scale of water exchange of a water body is widely used in assessment of water quality of estuaries e g alber and sheldon 1999 brooks et al 1999 guo and lordi 2000 huang et al 2011 miller and mcpherson 1991 bays e g abdelrhman 2005 choi and lee 2004 huang and spaulding 2002 liu et al 2004 pilson 1985 and other water bodies e g wang et al 2007 in this study the flushing time is defined as the time required for the mass of a conservative constituent which can be diluted but doesn t degrade in the water body reducing to a given percent of its initial mass the given percent namely cut off percentage was taken as 10 in huang et al 2011 and 1 e in abdelrhman 2005 and asselin and spaulding 1993 considering that the study area of this study is a relative open bay with short headlands and consequently the water exchange is relative fast 10 is chosen to be the cut off percentage to calculate the flushing time for estimating the flushing time of a particular area a unit tracer concentration is prescribed initially inside the area in a model and the transport of this mass is then calculated and the time variation of the tracer mass m t inside the calculated area is tracked the time required for reducing the tracer mass m t to 10 of the initial mass m0 is defined as the flushing time 4 3 simulated cases to investigate the influences of the dah and sah on the flushing time in different conditions 6 cases of tidal flow and 48 cases of constituent transport are simulated all the cases of tidal flow are run from may 11 2011 to may 25 2011 which is long enough to cover a spring tide and a neap tide the artificial headland conditions of the 6 cases are as listed in table 2 driven by the simulated results of the 6 cases of the flow model 48 case of constituent transport are simulated by the transport model to investigate the water exchange in different conditions of artificial headlands calculated areas and tidal conditions each simulated tidal flow field drives 8 constituent transport cases of 2 different calculation areas and 4 tidal conditions the two areas behind the artificial headlands as shown in fig 7 are selected as the calculation areas for the flushing time four tidal conditions including spring flood starting at 11 00 may 19 2011 spring ebb starting at 03 30 may 20 2011 neap flood starting at 05 00 may 14 2011 and neap ebb starting at 00 00 may 15 2011 as illustrated in fig 8 are chosen as the calculated tidal condition to study the effects of tidal condition to water exchange the simulated cases of the tidal flow and constituent transport are listed in table 2 for each case a unit tracer concentration is initially prescribed inside the studied area area 1 or area 2 and during the simulated time the time variation of the tracer mass inside the studied area is tracked 4 4 results and discussion the tracer mass reduction curves under different cases are given in fig 9 for area 1 and fig 10 for area 2 the curves with symbols represent the reduction history of the mean value of the fractions of the tracer mass under the same headland condition but different tidal conditions spring flood spring ebb neap flood and neap ebb while the vertical lines show the ranges of the fractions of the tracer mass under different tidal conditions as seen in figs 9 and 10 the tracer mass reduction curves under sah and dah cases are generally in between those of tah and nah cases the reduction rates of the tracer concentration increase with the increase of k t and p tc under sah and dah conditions respectively although with little differences when k t p tc the sah and dah cases have similar tracer mass reduction curves tidal conditions also have some influence on the tracer mass reduction process as indicated by the vertical lines in figs 9 and 10 representing the ranges of the fractions of the tracer mass due to the differences in tidal phases in order to have a direct comparison among the cases flushing times are calculated according to the tracer mass reduction curves when the tracer mass m t decreased to 10 of the initial mass m0 the calculated flushing times are plotter in fig 11 as seen the flushing times of sah and dah cases are obviously smaller than those of tah cases smaller values of k t and p tc induces larger flushing times e g the cases with k t and p tc equaling 0 3 have larger flushing times than those cases with k t and p tc equaling 0 5 the tidal phases have obvious influence on the flushing times as seen area 1 has longer flushing time in flood tides while area 2 has longer flushing time under ebb tides in particular the flushing times of area 2 are obviously longer under ebb conditions for both sah and dah cases in area 2 the flushing times under ebb tides are significantly longer than those under flood tides which can be explained by the tidal current directions the tidal current direction near the west beach is approximately parallel to the shoreline with a west to east direction under ebb condition and an east to west direction under flood condition under ebb tides the tidal flow direction is towards the open side of area 2 however due to low tidal levels under ebb tides the outlet flow over sah and through the channel of dah is weakened as a result a low velocity less than 0 01 m s area is formed behind the artificial headland as shown in fig 12 on the contrary although in flood tides the flow direction is east to west and towards the open side of area 1 the high tidal level ensures better flow out capabilities through sah or dah this explains why in area 1 the flushing times are longer in flood tides but the differences are not as significant in ebb tides 5 conclusions in this study the performance of sah and dah in a beach nourishment project is investigated and compared via numerical models the effects of sah and dah to shoreline change and water exchange are considered the results of this research provide references to improve the water exchange for the beach nourishment projects with artificial headlands to be constructed both the sah and dah have good performance in protecting the beach behind them when the k t or p tc equals 0 3 and 0 5 which are common used values for sah and dah hence it is feasible to use either sah or dah instead of tah to protect the beach comparison between the simulated shorelines of sah and dah cases shows that sah generates smoother shoreline shape which is beneficial for tourism landscape the eroding and silting characteristics of beach also has some effect on the performance of sah and dah under eroded condition the sensitivities of the shoreline to k t and p tc are similar while under silted condition the sah seems to have slightly better performance the water exchange conditions of the area behind the artificial headland under sah and dah cases are generally in between those of tah and nah cases with similar tracer mass reduction curves when k t and p tc have the same value the tidal condition has some influences on the flushing time of certain cases generally the sah and dah reduce the flushing time significantly compared to tah case in the tested ranges of k t and p tc e g in area 1 in the west beach the flushing times of sah cases with k t 0 3 and 0 5 and dah cases with p tc 0 3 and 0 5 are approximate 45 5 55 9 48 2 53 3 smaller than that of tah case in area 2 in the west beach the flushing times of sah cases with k t 0 3 and 0 5 and dah cases with p tc 0 3 and 0 5 are approximate 27 3 36 9 14 8 41 0 smaller than that of tah case generally speaking the using of both sah and dah are alternative measures of tah to improve the water exchange at the cost of an acceptable loss of beach protection performance the sah has some advantages in getting smooth shoreline shape and better performance under silted condition from the point of view of shoreline change the sah and dah have similar performance of strengthen the water exchange in the shadow zone actually in the nourishment project of the west beach the finally adopted scheme is a combination of sah and dah with k t 0 3 and p tc 0 5 and post nourishment survey shows that considerable widths of beach have been maintained at both ends of the west beach the information and insight gained from this study serve the beach nourishment in artificial headland bays to strengthen the water exchange and reduce the risk of water quality deterioration the conclusions of this paper are based on the case study on the west beach the conclusions are applicable to beaches of similar conditions i e sandy beaches with low wave energy and small tidal range however the sah and dah may also be used on other types of beaches but feasibility study and scheme comparison are needed before application of them acknowledgements the authors want to thank the supports from the national key r d program of china 2016yfc0401505 and the

23374,the prediction of fire detector activation time is essential to ship fire safety design in this study a model was developed to predict heat detector activation time under ship fires in a long narrow space firstly smoke transport time of fires in a long narrow space was determined by the time of smoke spreading from fire resource to the target location i e the location of heat detector in this study on the ceiling theoretical calculation method concerning smoke transport time under steady fires was then proposed based on the correlations of temperature and velocity developed in previous studies series of experiments were conducted in a reduced scale test rig for validation using the proposed method a dimensionless model of transport time under steady fires was theoretically derived secondly following the temperature rise equation of heat detector and considering the influence of smoke transport time lag analytic solution was obtained by integrating for steady or quasi steady fires and a time varying spreadsheet template combining with improved euler s method was proposed to predict the activation time for unsteady fires case study results showed the proposed model

terrible accidents for a ship statistics showed that the losses caused by ship fires are accounted for more than 11 total loss in all marine accidents kang et al 2017 ahmedx 2016 wang et al 2013 previous studies showed that an early fire detection system is crucial to detect the fire and effectively suppress fire as a fundamental component of fire detection system two types of detectors are commonly utilized in ships including fire smoke detector and heat detector international maritime organization imo 2008 and heat detector is widely used in long narrow spaces such as exit passageway corridor and beamed ceiling etc moreover heat detector is also serving as an initiator of automatic sprinkler system the current activation time prediction models for heat detector and their corresponding computing program have been popularly utilized such as detact qs and detact t2 they are applicable to large unconfined ceilings however there are many narrow spaces in a ship and the above calculation procedures are thus not applicable additionally as one of the most important design standards for ship fire safety the international code for fire safety systems international maritime organization 2015 appended to solas convention international maritime organization imo 2008 has roughly specified the maximum protection area and the largest installation spacing for a single heat detector the related provisions are lack of general and sophisticated theoretical supports regarding heat detector activation time this study focuses on the development of a theoretical model concerning heat detector activation time for long narrow spaces as a reference the development of the activation time model for the case of unconfined ceilings is summarized as following firstly alpert 2002 developed the correlations concerning velocities and temperatures of smoke spreading after conducting experimental and theoretical analysis for steady or quasi steady fires upon on that alpert 1972 presented a calculation method concerning the activation time of fire detectors using alpert s correlations evans and stroup stroup and evans 1988 published a computer program called detact qs which has been extensively utilized in fire safety design secondly for an unsteady fire it may take a longer time for smoke spreading from fire source to the heat detector on the ceiling due to small fire size at fire early stage mowrer 1990 presented the concept of transport time lag which always takes up a larger proportion of the detection time after that newman and mowrer 1990 newman 1988 gave an expression for calculating the transport time lag of power law fires especially for the case of t squared fires heskestad and delichatsios 1979 heskestad and delichatsios 1989 developed a model to predict the transport time lag which has been used in the activation time program of detact t2 evans and stroup 1985 also based on this model beyler 1984 worked out an analytical solution for the activation time of heat detector compared with the case of unconfined ceilings previous studies wang and xu 2013 wang et al 2011 2017 koslowski and motevalli 1993 delichatsios 1981 koslowski and motevalli 1994 hu et al 2005 ji et al 2011 li et al 2011 2013 kunsch 2002 li and haukur 2013 yang et al 2011 motevalli and yuan 2008 indicated different behaviors of smoke spreading in long narrow spaces including smoke spreading model the correlations of temperature or velocity etc this is because after fire onset smoke flow in long narrow spaces is largely influenced by barriers such as side walls crossbeam and crossing pipelines however the existing heat detector activation time models is based on the correlations in case of unconfined ceilings which have been confirmed unsuitable for the case of long narrow spaces of ships wang and xu 2013 wang et al 2011 koslowski and motevalli 1993 it should be mentioned that although the dimensionless equations regarding smoke transport time lag velocity and temperature considering the smoke lag effect in long narrow space for time squared fires were developed in our previous work wang et al 2017 the analytical solution of heat detector activation time has not been successfully obtained till now an alternative approximate method of solving the heat detector activation time is presented in this study in a similar way with the development of the activation time model of heat detector under unconfined ceilings this study focuses on developing an activation time model considering the transport time lag for long narrow spaces in ships there are four main sections the first section provides the general concepts of smoke ceiling jet and spreading process in long narrow spaces the second section focuses on the calculation method of smoke transport time under steady fires which is validated by a series of reduced scale experiments the fourth section derives a dimensionless theoretical model of transport time under steady fires the last section proposes a method to calculate the activation time of heat detector in long narrow spaces 2 smoke ceiling jet flow and spreading process smoke spreading process in a long narrow space is systematically studied delichatsios 1981 which can be divided into three stages as shown in fig 1 at the first stage smoke plume rises up vertically from fire source until hitting the ceiling the ceiling jet then spreads radially until reaching the side walls denoted by the dotted circle in fig 1 which can be considered as the second stage during the third stage ceiling jet transition from the radial to horizontal spreading it is usually considered as one dimensional smoke flow in the process of smoke spreading a phenomenon called density jump was shown at the position marked by o in fig 1 delichatsios 1981 considered the density jump as a transition of hot smoke from supercritical gravity flow froude number 1 to subcritical gravity flow froude number 1 after this transition the hot smoke spreads along the longitudinal direction of the long narrow space which is usually considered as one dimensional spreading while the smoke transition from the subcritical gravity flow to critical gravity flow froude number 1 for long narrow spaces with various aspect ratios height width density jump could happen at one dimensional spreading stage the third stage after the smoke were intersected by two side walls when the aspect ratio is more than 1 0 or during the second stage before the smoke hitting the two side walls when the aspect ratio is less than 1 0 3 calculating method of smoke transport time under steady fires 3 1 theoretical calculation method as stated in our previous work wang et al 2017 smoke transport time t t r a n s is defined as the time of fire smoke spreading from fire origin to the target location on the ceiling in long narrow spaces in ships the long narrow spaces are general with an aspect ratio of more than 1 from delichatsios s work delichatsios 1981 it means that the smoke would be intersected by two side walls before density jump occurring for a fire an approximately calculation method of smoke transport time was proposed previously as follows wang and xu 2013 wang et al 2017 it consists of three parts the time for smoke rising from the fire source to the ceiling t s the time for smoke transporting from the ceiling jet impingement point to the two side walls t r and one dimensional smoke flowing time t l therefore t t r a n s is the sum of the three times which can be expressed by 1 t t r a n s t s t r t l the details concerning three parts of the smoke transport time are seen in our previous work wang and xu 2013 wang et al 2017 for clarity some equations being necessary are presented as follows 2 t s 0 h 1 u s d z 3 t r 0 l b 1 u r d r 4 t l l b r 1 u l d r where u s u r and u l are the vertical velocity of smoke rising along the plume centerline and the radial spreading velocity and one dimensional

validation although the approximate calculation method regarding the smoke transport time for a steady fire is proposed in our previous work wang et al 2017 the validated experiments and its corresponding theoretical model are not performed for this a set of reduced scale test rig was built with a dimension of 1 m width 1 m height 6 m length the schematic diagram marked the positions for each one of experimental equipments as shown in fig 1 to facilitate the observation during the experiment the side walls of the corridor were made of fire proof glass which can stand a high temperature of 600 c the ceiling was made of 2 mm double layer stainless steel boards with kaowool filled in between to record the smoke temperature histories with different longitudinal distances a set of 0 5 mm k type thermocouples labeled as 1 to 4 with horizontal interval of 1 m were positioned 1 cm underneath the ceiling the measurement frequency of these thermocouples was 1 hz a 10 cm diameter n heptane pool fire was used as the fire source in the experiments before conducting the experiment the heat release rate of 10 cm n heptane pool fire was measured using a cone calorimeter the experimental heat release rate history has indicated a full developed burning period located within 50 160 s after the ignition and the average heat release rate is around 4 kw presented in our previous work wang et al 2017 it is indicated that after burning for about 60 s the pool fire reaching its steady burning stage therefore for each test before moving into this reduced scale experimental platform the n heptane pool was ignited and continuously burning for more than 60 s to ensure the pool combustion reaching a steady stage of fire experiment during the experiments a temperature rise of 1 c over the ambient temperature was employed as a criterion to determine the arrival of heat front of smoke at each measuring position hu et al 2004 tanaka et al 2000 the experiments were repeated four times the average smoke transport time were utilized to validate the model mentioned above as shown in fig 2 the prediction has a good agreement with experiments with a maximum error of approximately 7 therefore it can be concluded that the smoke transport time calculation method for unsteady fires mentioned in above sections is applicable this reduced scale test rig represents a long narrow space aboard a ship at a scale of less than 1 4 because of the case of long narrow space with a sectional area of 4 m width 4 m height aboard a ship maybe reach the maximum size for all long narrow spaces in typical ships it needs to be noticed that the length of 6 m designed in our experiments is only to facilitate the measuring the smoke transport time along the longitudinal direction but not means that this length corresponds to the 24 m length in full scale according to similarity theory the heat release rate is proportional to the scale ratio to the power of 5 2 i e q l 5 2 alpert 2002 l is the scale ratio taking a value of not less than 1 4 in this experimental rig the hrr of 4kw in our experiments is corresponding to a hrr up to 4 k w 1 4 5 2 128 k w in full scale 4 dimensionless theoretical model of transport time under steady fires to facilitate the calculation of smoke transport time for steady fires in a long narrow space it is necessary to develop a corresponding empirically theoretical model a theoretically dimensionless analysis is primarily conducted based on similarity theory sedov 1982 for a steady fire t t r a n s should be a function of several variables including q t ρ c p r h g l b and etc which can be expressed as follows 8 t t r a n s f q t ρ c p r h g l b dimensional analysis and similarity theory were employed to normalize eq 8 the characteristic time t 0 is defined as follows 9 t 0 h g q 0 1 3 where the dimensionless heat release rate of fire q 0 is defined as alpert 2002 10 q 0 q ρ c p t g 1 2 h 5 2 the dimensionless transport time and length are defined as follows respectively 11 t t r a n s t t r a n s t 0 12 l 0 r h therefore eq 8 can be then converted to 13 t t r a n s f l 0 l b h to obtain more smoke transport times under different scenarios different fire cases were assumed with given parameters including heat release rate ceiling height radial distance and half width of corridor the descriptions of all cases and its related results are summarized in table 1 the dimensionless time t t r a n s and the dimensionless length l 0 can be obtained using eqs 11 and 12 respectively by correlating t t r a n s and l 0 with l b h varying from 0 21 to 0 5 the results are shown in fig 5 a and 5 g a good linear relationship can be observed between these two dimensionless quantities it can be known from fig 3 that the slopes of the regression between t t r a n s and l 0 are dependent on l b h to address the effects of l b h on the slopes a correlation is then assumed 14 t t r a n s k l 0 where k is the slope of regression which is considered dependent on l b h by correlating k with l b h as shown in fig 4 the relationship can be given by 15 k 1 358 l b h 0 1933 combining eqs 11 15 a closed form dimensionless equation of smoke transport time can be obtained for steady fires in long narrow spaces 16 t t r a n s h g q 1 3 1 358 l b h 0 1933 r h previous study li et al 2011 on smoke transport time under beamed ceiling channel and tunnel demonstrated that the longitudinal temperature distribution is largely dependent on the aspect ratio of cross section two types of aspect ratio of the cross section include aspect ratio of more than 1 0 i e l b h is less than 0 5 and the others i e l b h is more than 0 5 these two different types of aspect ratio would result in different stanton numbers of smoke spreading which is defined as follows 17 s t h c ρ u l c p p r 2 3 f 2 where h c is the convective coefficient of smoke spreading over the ceiling w m2 k ρ is ambient air density kg m3 p r is prandtl number considering a value of 0 7 0 8 for gas and f is the friction coefficient between the smoke and the ceiling different stanton numbers further lead to various smoke spreading characteristics delichatsios 1981 explained this based on experimental results as mentioned in section 2 density jump may occur during the second or third stage of smoke transportation which is determined by the aspect ratio of long narrow spaces as the aspect ratio is larger than 1 density jump would happen during the third stage after the ceiling jet flow of smoke were intersected by the two side walls or during the second stage before the smoke hitting the two side walls when the aspect ratio is less than 1 0 kunsch s study kunsch 2002 obtained s t within a range of 0 0027 0 0037 while li et al li et al 2013 indicated a different value of 0 00733 for 1 0 higher aspect ratio of section of long narrow spaces and 0 00406 for the others this may be caused by different methods of determining the friction coefficient between smoke and tunnel or other type of wall as this study is not focusing on tunnel the value of s t in the following analysis will be adopted from delichatsios 1981 due to similar scenarios which is range in 0 012 0 03 changing the numeric value of s t the corresponding equation of k was obtained by repeating the calculations for the fire scenarios listed in table 1 and conducting a parameter fitting of eq 14 the fitting curves of k are illustrated in fig 5 the equations corresponding to the fitting curves are also collected in the rightmost column in table 2 it is easy to see that k increases with a higher s t and further leads to a longer transport time it is known that from eq 15 k correlates with s t of a function relation of power exponent an expression can be then assumed 18 k c l b h m where coefficients c and m imply the effects of s t on k based on the numeric results shown in table 2 the results of the related coefficients correlated with s t are shown in fig 6 it was observed that both c and m show good linear relationships with s t expressed by the following eqs 19 and 20 respectively 19 c 4 685 s t 1 217 20 m 1 135 s t 0 196 combining eqs 15 19 and 20 a closed form dimensionless equation of smoke transport time is obtained 21 t t r a n s h g q 1 3 4 685 s t 1 217 l b h 1 135 s t 0 196 r h 5 activation time model of heat detector in long narrow spaces generally heat detector mainly includes three types of fixed temperature detector rate of rise detector and rate of rise fixed temperature detector for each one the prediction model for heat detector temperature rise rate is same and based on a convective heat transfer process neglecting radiation heat loss from the thermo sensitive component of heat detector for simplifying the introduction the activation time model of a fixed temperature detector is focused on the first order differential equation that describes temperature rise rate of the sensitive element of heat detector is given by koslowski and motevalli 1994 li and haukur 2013 22 d t e d t u r t i t t e where t e is the temperature of sensitive element of heat detector k t is the temperature of smoke flowing through the detector k u is one dimensional smoke flow velocity calculated using eq 7a m s and r t i is the response time index of heat detector m s 1 2 before the arrival of the hot smoke the temperature of sensitive element of heat detector is equal to ambient temperature 23 t e t t t l a g t l a g is defined as smoke transport time lag which is determined by the time from fire onset to the time of smoke reaching the heat detector 5 1 analytic analysis for the case of steady or quasi steady fire for a fixed temperature detector assuming that the activation temperature of heat detector is t a c t the temperature rise over the ambient temperature is given by 24 δ t a c t t a c t t it should be noticed if the size of a steady fire is small enough the smoke temperature induced by the fire is thus not high enough to activate the heat detector i e the temperature rise of the element sensitive of heat detector is less than the threshold value of the temperature rise of the heat detector for a steady or a quasi steady fire with a suitable fire size the smoke temperature rise induced by the fire is high enough to activate the heat detector the smoke transport time lag can be calculated by eq 21 however for such a large scale fire the smoke transport time lag is often negligible compared with the time of hot smoke heating the sensitive element of heat detector up to its temperature threshold nevertheless the smoke transport time lag is still calculated by eq 21 i e t l a g t t r a n s for a steady fire or quasi steady fire so the analytic solution of activation time can be easily obtained by integrating over the time on eq 22 25 t r t i u ln t t t t e substituting eq 7a into eq 24 the complete expression of the activation time of heat detector is obtained as follows 26 t a c t r t i 0 3194 h δ t 1 4 h l b 1 12 ln δ t δ t δ t a c t where t a c t is the activation time of heat detector and δ t is calculated by eq 7b 5 2 numeric analysis for the case of unsteady fire for the case of unsteady fires the proposed activation time prediction model of heat detector consists of eqs 7 22 and 23 to solve this set of equations the expression of heat release rate varying with the time should be substituted into eq 7 after that it is to predict the needed transport time to reach the activation temperature and smoke flow velocity at the heat detector obviously it is very difficult to obtain the analytic solution of the activation time because of the nonlinear relationship as an alternative way a time varying spreadsheet template is utilized to obtain the numeric solution instead and its related calculation procedures shown in table 3 the time varying spreadsheet is in a similar manner to the numerical analysis that the whole time period was divided into numerous time steps which are small enough to ensure the heat release rate of fire source at each time step can be regarded as a constant then the heat release rate at each time step q t i can be obtained according to the given hrr history smoke velocity at one dimensional propagation stage third stage u l t i can be calculated using eq 7a the smoke transport time at the time of t i t t r a n s q t i is calculated using eq 21 the arrival time for the produced smoke from fire source at the time step of t i reaching the heat detector can be calculated by 27 t a r r i v a l t i t i t t r a n s q t i as stated above it should be noticed that the concept of smoke transport time in this study is only aiming at a steady fire as concerned the smoke transport time lag for an unsteady fire is not simply equal to the smoke transport time for an unsteady fire smoke transport time lag is determined by the time from fire onset to the time the first smoke front reaching heat detector which is a sum of the time of smoke generated from fire and its transportation time from fire origin to the location of heat detector following above analysis and eq 27 the arrival time of the first smoke front at heat detector t a r r i v a l t 1 a i e smoke transport time lag mentioned above t l a g is determined by the minimum time step for the smoke front reaching the heat detector after that the heat detector is continually heated by follow up the second third smoke front and so on it should be mentioned that during the time period between the j and j 1 smoke fronts the temperature rise of the heat detector is calculated by eq 22 based on iterations the improved euler s method with a second order accuracy stoer and bulirsch 2007 called as the prediction correction method was adopted to solve eq 22 the iteration procedure implemented is given as follows 28a t e p u l t j r t i t g j t e j t l a g j 1 t l a g j t 0 j 28b t e c u l t j 1 r t i t g j 1 t e p t l a g j 1 t l a g j t 0 j 28c t e j 1 1 2 t e p t e c t e p and t e c represent the predicted value and corrected value of the finally expected value of t e j 1 respectively the expected value of t e j 1 is a half of the sum of t e p and t e c it should be noticed that the temperature of the sensitive element of the heat detector remains at the ambient temperature before the arrival of hot smoke the predicted transport time lag of smoke originated from the fire early stage shows a relatively large value before the arrival of the first smoke front its physical meaning can be interpreted as the fire size is too small at the early stage and thus smoke temperature and its thermal buoyancy rapidly decreases due to the micro phase energy dissipation behaviors such as viscous dissipation and diffusion in the transport process hydraulic pressure loss of the smoke is high enough disenabling smoke from arriving at the location of heat detector ultimately the smoke generated during the fire early stage is then caught up and involved by the follow up hot smoke it is therefore reflected in the transport time calculation being a large numeric value the calculation procedure can be summarized by the following five steps as shown in fig 7 6 case studies to illustrate the capability of the developed model for a detector or sprinkler with a fixed temperature two scenarios of long narrow spaces were selected with input parameters of the model provided in table 4 the results obtained by the proposed model and the current detect t2 respectively were compared for the first case the fire source is centrally located in a long narrow corridor and set as t squared growing fire which is generally used in fire safety design holborna et al 2004 the heat release rate of fire source at different time steps can be calculated using q t α t 2 the heat detector is located on the ceiling and 2 m away from the fire plume centerline other parameters for this case are shown in table 4 by varying the ceiling height h from 2 m to 4 m with an interval of 0 2 m the activation time of the heat detector were calculated by the proposed model in this study and the previously popularly used model detect t2 in open spaces the results are shown in fig 8 a it can be seen that the activation time from our proposed model are higher than those of detect t2 the difference is about 35 for a 2 m high ceiling and the difference keeps increasing with a higher ceiling and reaches about 65 at h of 4 m for the second case different scenarios are implemented by varying the parameter r from 1 2 m 3 0 m with an interval of 0 1 at h of 3 5m other parameters are also the same and presented in table 4 the comparison between the proposed model and detect t2 can be seen in fig 8 b both the activation times show a good linear increasing trend with the horizontal distance from the centerline of fire plume of r the predicted activation times of our proposed model are longer than those of detect t2 at r of 1 2 m the difference between the two predictions is about 80 while it decreases with a bigger r and reaches about 27 at r of 3 m based on the above two cases the prediction from the proposed model and the current model of detect t2 respectively are significantly different this is mainly because of the different smoke behaviors under a long narrow or open space that result in different correlations regarding velocity and temperature distribution it can be concluded that the proposed activation time model can be applicable to long narrow spaces which can expand the application scope of detect t2 it should be mentioned that due to the experimental difficulties in designing an exact time squared fire at present the corresponding experiments would be conducted in the future to validate the capability of the proposed model in this aspect 7 conclusions transport time lag behaviors of smoke spread and its applications in activation time theoretical model of heat detector were investigated experimentally and numerically for ship fires in long narrow spaces the following conclusions can be drawn 1 a theoretical model regarding smoke transport time is developed based on the weak fire plume theories and one dimensional smoke flow equation in long narrow spaces the reduced scale experimental results show that the theoretical model proposed is validated with similarity theory a non dimensional model concerning smoke transport time for steady fires in long narrow spaces is developed as well for validation several experimental rigs with different dimensions would be set up to conduct the corresponding verification experiments to the model in the future 2 a mathematical model concerning the activation time of heat detector in long narrow spaces is theoretically developed for steady fires or quasi steady fires the analytic solution to the activation time is obtained by integrating over time on the temperature rise equation of heat detector for unsteady fires an alternative of a time varying spreadsheet template taking into account the smoke transport time lag is proposed to predict the activation time the calculation procedures consisting of five steps are also presented accordingly 3 it is indicated from the comparison that the predictions of activation time based on the proposed model are much higher than those from detect t2 this is mainly because the different smoke behaviors such as temperature and velocity distribution between the long narrow and open spaces the proposed model developed in this work is applicable for long narrow spaces and expand the application scope of detact t2 it is should be mentioned that this work only addressed the theoretical model for the activation time model of heat detector to extensively apply this work to engineering practice the related experimental validation of this model will be conducted in future work acknowledgments the authors would like to thank the

23374,the prediction of fire detector activation time is essential to ship fire safety design in this study a model was developed to predict heat detector activation time under ship fires in a long narrow space firstly smoke transport time of fires in a long narrow space was determined by the time of smoke spreading from fire resource to the target location i e the location of heat detector in this study on the ceiling theoretical calculation method concerning smoke transport time under steady fires was then proposed based on the correlations of temperature and velocity developed in previous studies series of experiments were conducted in a reduced scale test rig for validation using the proposed method a dimensionless model of transport time under steady fires was theoretically derived secondly following the temperature rise equation of heat detector and considering the influence of smoke transport time lag analytic solution was obtained by integrating for steady or quasi steady fires and a time varying spreadsheet template combining with improved euler s method was proposed to predict the activation time for unsteady fires case study results showed the proposed model

terrible accidents for a ship statistics showed that the losses caused by ship fires are accounted for more than 11 total loss in all marine accidents kang et al 2017 ahmedx 2016 wang et al 2013 previous studies showed that an early fire detection system is crucial to detect the fire and effectively suppress fire as a fundamental component of fire detection system two types of detectors are commonly utilized in ships including fire smoke detector and heat detector international maritime organization imo 2008 and heat detector is widely used in long narrow spaces such as exit passageway corridor and beamed ceiling etc moreover heat detector is also serving as an initiator of automatic sprinkler system the current activation time prediction models for heat detector and their corresponding computing program have been popularly utilized such as detact qs and detact t2 they are applicable to large unconfined ceilings however there are many narrow spaces in a ship and the above calculation procedures are thus not applicable additionally as one of the most important design standards for ship fire safety the international code for fire safety systems international maritime organization 2015 appended to solas convention international maritime organization imo 2008 has roughly specified the maximum protection area and the largest installation spacing for a single heat detector the related provisions are lack of general and sophisticated theoretical supports regarding heat detector activation time this study focuses on the development of a theoretical model concerning heat detector activation time for long narrow spaces as a reference the development of the activation time model for the case of unconfined ceilings is summarized as following firstly alpert 2002 developed the correlations concerning velocities and temperatures of smoke spreading after conducting experimental and theoretical analysis for steady or quasi steady fires upon on that alpert 1972 presented a calculation method concerning the activation time of fire detectors using alpert s correlations evans and stroup stroup and evans 1988 published a computer program called detact qs which has been extensively utilized in fire safety design secondly for an unsteady fire it may take a longer time for smoke spreading from fire source to the heat detector on the ceiling due to small fire size at fire early stage mowrer 1990 presented the concept of transport time lag which always takes up a larger proportion of the detection time after that newman and mowrer 1990 newman 1988 gave an expression for calculating the transport time lag of power law fires especially for the case of t squared fires heskestad and delichatsios 1979 heskestad and delichatsios 1989 developed a model to predict the transport time lag which has been used in the activation time program of detact t2 evans and stroup 1985 also based on this model beyler 1984 worked out an analytical solution for the activation time of heat detector compared with the case of unconfined ceilings previous studies wang and xu 2013 wang et al 2011 2017 koslowski and motevalli 1993 delichatsios 1981 koslowski and motevalli 1994 hu et al 2005 ji et al 2011 li et al 2011 2013 kunsch 2002 li and haukur 2013 yang et al 2011 motevalli and yuan 2008 indicated different behaviors of smoke spreading in long narrow spaces including smoke spreading model the correlations of temperature or velocity etc this is because after fire onset smoke flow in long narrow spaces is largely influenced by barriers such as side walls crossbeam and crossing pipelines however the existing heat detector activation time models is based on the correlations in case of unconfined ceilings which have been confirmed unsuitable for the case of long narrow spaces of ships wang and xu 2013 wang et al 2011 koslowski and motevalli 1993 it should be mentioned that although the dimensionless equations regarding smoke transport time lag velocity and temperature considering the smoke lag effect in long narrow space for time squared fires were developed in our previous work wang et al 2017 the analytical solution of heat detector activation time has not been successfully obtained till now an alternative approximate method of solving the heat detector activation time is presented in this study in a similar way with the development of the activation time model of heat detector under unconfined ceilings this study focuses on developing an activation time model considering the transport time lag for long narrow spaces in ships there are four main sections the first section provides the general concepts of smoke ceiling jet and spreading process in long narrow spaces the second section focuses on the calculation method of smoke transport time under steady fires which is validated by a series of reduced scale experiments the fourth section derives a dimensionless theoretical model of transport time under steady fires the last section proposes a method to calculate the activation time of heat detector in long narrow spaces 2 smoke ceiling jet flow and spreading process smoke spreading process in a long narrow space is systematically studied delichatsios 1981 which can be divided into three stages as shown in fig 1 at the first stage smoke plume rises up vertically from fire source until hitting the ceiling the ceiling jet then spreads radially until reaching the side walls denoted by the dotted circle in fig 1 which can be considered as the second stage during the third stage ceiling jet transition from the radial to horizontal spreading it is usually considered as one dimensional smoke flow in the process of smoke spreading a phenomenon called density jump was shown at the position marked by o in fig 1 delichatsios 1981 considered the density jump as a transition of hot smoke from supercritical gravity flow froude number 1 to subcritical gravity flow froude number 1 after this transition the hot smoke spreads along the longitudinal direction of the long narrow space which is usually considered as one dimensional spreading while the smoke transition from the subcritical gravity flow to critical gravity flow froude number 1 for long narrow spaces with various aspect ratios height width density jump could happen at one dimensional spreading stage the third stage after the smoke were intersected by two side walls when the aspect ratio is more than 1 0 or during the second stage before the smoke hitting the two side walls when the aspect ratio is less than 1 0 3 calculating method of smoke transport time under steady fires 3 1 theoretical calculation method as stated in our previous work wang et al 2017 smoke transport time t t r a n s is defined as the time of fire smoke spreading from fire origin to the target location on the ceiling in long narrow spaces in ships the long narrow spaces are general with an aspect ratio of more than 1 from delichatsios s work delichatsios 1981 it means that the smoke would be intersected by two side walls before density jump occurring for a fire an approximately calculation method of smoke transport time was proposed previously as follows wang and xu 2013 wang et al 2017 it consists of three parts the time for smoke rising from the fire source to the ceiling t s the time for smoke transporting from the ceiling jet impingement point to the two side walls t r and one dimensional smoke flowing time t l therefore t t r a n s is the sum of the three times which can be expressed by 1 t t r a n s t s t r t l the details concerning three parts of the smoke transport time are seen in our previous work wang and xu 2013 wang et al 2017 for clarity some equations being necessary are presented as follows 2 t s 0 h 1 u s d z 3 t r 0 l b 1 u r d r 4 t l l b r 1 u l d r where u s u r and u l are the vertical velocity of smoke rising along the plume centerline and the radial spreading velocity and one dimensional smoke flow velocity respectively and calculated by eqs 5 7 5 u s 5 6 9 10 π η 2 1 3 g c p ρ t 1 3 q 1 3 z 1 3 6 u r 0 96 q h 1 3 r h 0 15 0 195 q h 1 3 r h 5 6 r h 0 15 7a u l 0 102 h δ t h l b 1 6 r

validation although the approximate calculation method regarding the smoke transport time for a steady fire is proposed in our previous work wang et al 2017 the validated experiments and its corresponding theoretical model are not performed for this a set of reduced scale test rig was built with a dimension of 1 m width 1 m height 6 m length the schematic diagram marked the positions for each one of experimental equipments as shown in fig 1 to facilitate the observation during the experiment the side walls of the corridor were made of fire proof glass which can stand a high temperature of 600 c the ceiling was made of 2 mm double layer stainless steel boards with kaowool filled in between to record the smoke temperature histories with different longitudinal distances a set of 0 5 mm k type thermocouples labeled as 1 to 4 with horizontal interval of 1 m were positioned 1 cm underneath the ceiling the measurement frequency of these thermocouples was 1 hz a 10 cm diameter n heptane pool fire was used as the fire source in the experiments before conducting the experiment the heat release rate of 10 cm n heptane pool fire was measured using a cone calorimeter the experimental heat release rate history has indicated a full developed burning period located within 50 160 s after the ignition and the average heat release rate is around 4 kw presented in our previous work wang et al 2017 it is indicated that after burning for about 60 s the pool fire reaching its steady burning stage therefore for each test before moving into this reduced scale experimental platform the n heptane pool was ignited and continuously burning for more than 60 s to ensure the pool combustion reaching a steady stage of fire experiment during the experiments a temperature rise of 1 c over the ambient temperature was employed as a criterion to determine the arrival of heat front of smoke at each measuring position hu et al 2004 tanaka et al 2000 the experiments were repeated four times the average smoke transport time were utilized to validate the model mentioned above as shown in fig 2 the prediction has a good agreement with experiments with a maximum error of approximately 7 therefore it can be concluded that the smoke transport time calculation method for unsteady fires mentioned in above sections is applicable this reduced scale test rig represents a long narrow space aboard a ship at a scale of less than 1 4 because of the case of long narrow space with a sectional area of 4 m width 4 m height aboard a ship maybe reach the maximum size for all long narrow spaces in typical ships it needs to be noticed that the length of 6 m designed in our experiments is only to facilitate the measuring the smoke transport time along the longitudinal direction but not means that this length corresponds to the 24 m length in full scale according to similarity theory the heat release rate is proportional to the scale ratio to the power of 5 2 i e q l 5 2 alpert 2002 l is the scale ratio taking a value of not less than 1 4 in this experimental rig the hrr of 4kw in our experiments is corresponding to a hrr up to 4 k w 1 4 5 2 128 k w in full scale 4 dimensionless theoretical model of transport time under steady fires to facilitate the calculation of smoke transport time for steady fires in a long narrow space it is necessary to develop a corresponding empirically theoretical model a theoretically dimensionless analysis is primarily conducted based on similarity theory sedov 1982 for a steady fire t t r a n s should be a function of several variables including q t ρ c p r h g l b and etc which can be expressed as follows 8 t t r a n s f q t ρ c p r h g l b dimensional analysis and similarity theory were employed to normalize eq 8 the characteristic time t 0 is defined as follows 9 t 0 h g q 0 1 3 where the dimensionless heat release rate of fire q 0 is defined as alpert 2002 10 q 0 q ρ c p t g 1 2 h 5 2 the dimensionless transport time and length are defined as follows respectively 11 t t r a n s t t r a n s t 0 12 l 0 r h therefore eq 8 can be then converted to 13 t t r a n s f l 0 l b h to obtain more smoke transport times under different scenarios different fire cases were assumed with given parameters including heat release rate ceiling height radial distance and half width of corridor the descriptions of all cases and its related results are summarized in table 1 the dimensionless time t t r a n s and the dimensionless length l 0 can be obtained using eqs 11 and 12 respectively by correlating t t r a n s and l 0 with l b h varying from 0 21 to 0 5 the results are shown in fig 5 a and 5 g a good linear relationship can be observed between these two dimensionless quantities it can be known from fig 3 that the slopes of the regression between t t r a n s and l 0 are dependent on l b h to address the effects of l b h on the slopes a correlation is then assumed 14 t t r a n s k l 0 where k is the slope of regression which is considered dependent on l b h by correlating k with l b h as shown in fig 4 the relationship can be given by 15 k 1 358 l b h 0 1933 combining eqs 11 15 a closed form dimensionless equation of smoke transport time can be obtained for steady fires in long narrow spaces 16 t t r a n s h g q 1 3 1 358 l b h 0 1933 r h previous study li et al 2011 on smoke transport time under beamed ceiling channel and tunnel demonstrated that the longitudinal temperature distribution is largely dependent on the aspect ratio of cross section two types of aspect ratio of the cross section include aspect ratio of more than 1 0 i e l b h is less than 0 5 and the others i e l b h is more than 0 5 these two different types of aspect ratio would result in different stanton numbers of smoke spreading which is defined as follows 17 s t h c ρ u l c p p r 2 3 f 2 where h c is the convective coefficient of smoke spreading over the ceiling w m2 k ρ is ambient air density kg m3 p r is prandtl number considering a value of 0 7 0 8 for gas and f is the friction coefficient between the smoke and the ceiling different stanton numbers further lead to various smoke spreading characteristics delichatsios 1981 explained this based on experimental results as mentioned in section 2 density jump may occur during the second or third stage of smoke transportation which is determined by the aspect ratio of long narrow spaces as the aspect ratio is larger than 1 density jump would happen during the third stage after the ceiling jet flow of smoke were intersected by the two side walls or during the second stage before the smoke hitting the two side walls when the aspect ratio is less than 1 0 kunsch s study kunsch 2002 obtained s t within a range of 0 0027 0 0037 while li et al li et al 2013 indicated a different value of 0 00733 for 1 0 higher aspect ratio of section of long narrow spaces and 0 00406 for the others this may be caused by different methods of determining the friction coefficient between smoke and tunnel or other type of wall as this study is not focusing on tunnel the value of s t in the following analysis will be adopted from delichatsios 1981 due to similar scenarios which is range in 0 012 0 03 changing the numeric value of s t the corresponding equation of k was obtained by repeating the calculations for the fire scenarios listed in table 1 and conducting a parameter fitting of eq 14 the fitting curves of k are illustrated in fig 5 the equations corresponding to the fitting curves are also collected in the rightmost column in table 2 it is easy to see that k increases with a higher s t and further leads to a longer transport time it is known that from eq 15 k correlates with s t of a function relation of power exponent an expression can be then assumed 18 k c l b h m where coefficients c and m imply the effects of s t on k based on the numeric results shown in table 2 the results of the related coefficients correlated with s t are shown in fig 6 it was observed that both c and m show good linear relationships with s t expressed by the following eqs 19 and 20 respectively 19 c 4 685 s

activation time model of heat detector in long narrow spaces generally heat detector mainly includes three types of fixed temperature detector rate of rise detector and rate of rise fixed temperature detector for each one the prediction model for heat detector temperature rise rate is same and based on a convective heat transfer process neglecting radiation heat loss from the thermo sensitive component of heat detector for simplifying the introduction the activation time model of a fixed temperature detector is focused on the first order differential equation that describes temperature rise rate of the sensitive element of heat detector is given by koslowski and motevalli 1994 li and haukur 2013 22 d t e d t u r t i t t e where t e is the temperature of sensitive element of heat detector k t is the temperature of smoke flowing through the detector k u is one dimensional smoke flow velocity calculated using eq 7a m s and r t i is the response time index of heat detector m s 1 2 before the arrival of the hot smoke the temperature of sensitive element of heat detector is equal to ambient temperature 23 t e t t t l a g t l a g is defined as smoke transport time lag which is determined by the time from fire onset to the time of smoke reaching the heat detector 5 1 analytic analysis for the case of steady or quasi steady fire for a fixed temperature detector assuming that the activation temperature of heat detector is t a c t the temperature rise over the ambient temperature is given by 24 δ t a c t t a c t t it should be noticed if the size of a steady fire is small enough the smoke temperature induced by the fire is thus not high enough to activate the heat detector i e the temperature rise of the element sensitive of heat detector is less than the threshold value of the temperature rise of the heat detector for a steady or a quasi steady fire with a suitable fire size the smoke temperature rise induced by the fire is high enough to activate the heat detector the smoke transport time lag can be calculated by eq 21 however for such a large scale fire the smoke transport time lag is often negligible compared with the time of hot smoke heating the sensitive element of heat detector up to its temperature threshold nevertheless the smoke transport time lag is still calculated by eq 21 i e t l a g t t r a n s for a steady fire or quasi steady fire so the analytic solution of activation time can be easily obtained by integrating over the time on eq 22 25 t r t i u ln t t t t e substituting eq 7a into eq 24 the complete expression of the activation time of heat detector is obtained as follows 26 t a c t r t i 0 3194 h δ t 1 4 h l b 1 12 ln δ t δ t δ t a c t where t a c t is the activation time of heat detector and δ t is calculated by eq 7b 5 2 numeric analysis for the case of unsteady fire for the case of unsteady fires the proposed activation time prediction model of heat detector consists of eqs 7 22 and 23 to solve this set of equations the expression of heat release rate varying with the time should be substituted into eq 7 after that it is to predict the needed transport time to reach the activation temperature and smoke flow velocity at the heat detector obviously it is very difficult to obtain the analytic solution of the activation time because of the nonlinear relationship as an alternative way a time varying spreadsheet template is utilized to obtain the numeric solution instead and its related calculation procedures shown in table 3 the time varying spreadsheet is in a similar manner to the numerical analysis that the whole time period was divided into numerous time steps which are small enough to ensure the heat release rate of fire source at each time step can be regarded as a constant then the heat release rate at each time step q t i can be obtained according to the given hrr history smoke velocity at one dimensional propagation stage third stage u l t i can be calculated using eq 7a the smoke transport time at the time of t i t t r a n s q t i is calculated using eq 21 the arrival time for the produced smoke from fire source at the time step of t i reaching the heat detector can be calculated by 27 t a r r i v a l t i t i t t r a n s q t i as stated above it should be noticed that the concept of smoke transport time in this study is only aiming at a steady fire as concerned the smoke transport time lag for an unsteady fire is not simply equal to the smoke transport time for an unsteady fire smoke transport time lag is determined by the time from fire onset to the time the first smoke front reaching heat detector which is a sum of the time of smoke generated from fire and its transportation time from fire origin to the location of heat detector following above analysis and eq 27 the arrival time of the first smoke front at heat detector t a r r i v a l t 1 a i e smoke transport time lag mentioned above t l a g is determined by the minimum time step for the smoke front reaching the heat detector after that the heat detector is continually heated by follow up the second third smoke front and so on it should be mentioned that during the time period between the j and j 1 smoke fronts the temperature rise of the heat detector is calculated by eq 22 based on iterations the improved euler s method with a second order accuracy stoer and bulirsch 2007 called as the prediction correction method was adopted to solve eq 22 the iteration procedure implemented is given as follows 28a t e p u l t j r t i t g j t e j t l a g j 1 t l a g j t 0 j 28b t e c u l t j 1 r t i t g j 1 t e p t l a g j 1 t l a g j t 0 j 28c t e j 1 1 2 t e p t e c t e p and t e c represent the predicted value and corrected value of the finally expected value of t e j 1 respectively the expected value of t e j 1 is a half of the sum of t e p and t e c it should be noticed that the temperature of the sensitive element of the heat detector remains at the ambient temperature before the arrival of hot smoke the predicted transport time lag of smoke originated from the fire early stage shows a relatively large value before the arrival of the first smoke front its physical meaning can be interpreted as the fire size is too small at the early stage and thus smoke temperature and its thermal buoyancy rapidly decreases due to the micro phase energy dissipation behaviors such as viscous dissipation and diffusion in the transport process hydraulic pressure loss of the smoke is high enough disenabling smoke from arriving at the location of heat detector ultimately the smoke generated during the fire early stage is then caught up and involved by the follow up hot smoke it is therefore reflected in the transport time calculation being a large numeric value the calculation procedure can be summarized by the following five steps as shown in fig 7 6 case studies to illustrate the capability of the developed model for a detector or sprinkler with a fixed temperature two scenarios of long narrow spaces were selected with input parameters of the model provided in table 4 the results obtained by the proposed model and the current detect t2 respectively were compared for the first case the fire source is centrally located in a long narrow corridor and set as t squared growing fire which is generally used in fire safety design holborna et al 2004 the heat release rate of fire source at different time steps can be calculated using q t α t 2 the heat detector is located on the ceiling and 2 m away from the fire plume centerline other parameters for this case are shown in table 4 by varying the ceiling height h from 2 m to 4 m with an interval of 0 2 m the activation time of the heat detector were calculated by the proposed model in this study and the previously popularly used model detect t2 in open spaces the results are shown in fig 8 a it can be seen that the activation time from our proposed model are higher than those of detect t2 the difference is about 35 for a 2 m high ceiling and the difference keeps increasing with a higher ceiling and reaches about 65 at h of 4 m for the second case different scenarios are implemented by varying the parameter r from 1 2 m 3 0 m with an interval of 0 1 at h of 3 5m other parameters are also the same and presented in table 4 the comparison between the proposed model and detect t2 can be seen in fig 8 b both the activation times show a good linear increasing trend with the horizontal distance from the centerline of fire plume of r the predicted activation times of our proposed model are longer than those of detect t2 at r of 1 2 m the difference between the two predictions is about 80 while it decreases with a bigger r and reaches about 27 at r of 3 m based on the above two cases the prediction from the proposed model and the current model of detect t2 respectively are significantly different this is mainly because of the different smoke behaviors under a long narrow or open space that result in different correlations regarding velocity and temperature distribution it can be concluded that the proposed activation time model can be applicable to long narrow spaces which can expand the application scope of detect t2 it should be mentioned that due to the experimental difficulties in designing an exact time squared fire at present the corresponding experiments would be conducted in the future to validate the capability of the proposed model in this aspect 7 conclusions transport time lag behaviors of smoke spread and its applications in activation time theoretical model of heat detector were investigated experimentally and numerically for ship fires in long narrow spaces the following conclusions can be drawn 1 a theoretical model regarding smoke transport time is developed based on the weak fire plume theories and one dimensional smoke flow equation in long narrow spaces the reduced scale experimental results show that the theoretical model proposed is validated with similarity theory a non dimensional model concerning smoke transport time for steady fires in long narrow spaces is developed as well for validation several experimental rigs with different dimensions would be set up to conduct the corresponding verification experiments to the model in the future 2 a mathematical model concerning the activation time of heat detector in long narrow spaces is theoretically developed for steady fires or quasi steady fires the analytic solution to the activation time is obtained by integrating over time on the temperature rise equation of heat detector for unsteady fires an alternative of a time varying spreadsheet template taking into account the smoke transport time lag is proposed to predict the activation time the calculation procedures consisting of five steps are also presented accordingly 3 it is indicated from the comparison that the predictions of activation time based on the proposed model are much higher than those from detect t2 this is mainly because the different smoke behaviors such as temperature and velocity distribution between the long narrow and open spaces the proposed model developed in this work is applicable for long narrow spaces and expand the application scope of detact t2 it is should be mentioned that this work only addressed the theoretical model for the activation time model of heat detector to extensively apply this work to engineering practice the related experimental validation of this model will be conducted in future work acknowledgments the authors would like to thank the
