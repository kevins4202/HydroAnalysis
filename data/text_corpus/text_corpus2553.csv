12765,this study focused on treating municipal wastewater using a novel two stage partial nitritation anammox pn a process by gel immobilization the first stage employed a pn immobilized carrier reactor in which the nitrite accumulation rate was 90 7 95 1 and the cod removal rate was 33 2 2 9 the second stage comprised an anammox based sequencing batch reactor sbr fed with the effluent from the first stage two second stage sbrs were tested to compare their treatment effect one contained anammox granules ag sbr and one contained anammox immobilized carriers ac sbr the ac sbr exhibited better nitrogen removal performance than the ag sbr during the pn a process with the nitrogen removal rate of ac sbr being 83 4 1 5 the gel immobilization technology effectively reduced the adverse effects of dissolved oxygen and organic matter in the pn reactor effluent on the anammox system aerobic denitrification was observed in the ag sbr in the pn immobilized carrier nitrospira was the dominant nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob with a relative abundance of 0 10 indicating that the growth of nob was effectively inhibited in municipal wastewater candidatus kuenenia was the dominant genus of anammox bacteria exhibiting a relative abundance of 1 50 and 19 26 in the ag sbr and ac sbr respectively thus the pn a process by gel immobilization is an effective treatment for municipal wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords anammox granules anammox immobilized carrier gel immobilization municipal wastewater two stage pn a process data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the partial nitritation anammox pn a process is an ideal energy saving and resource recovery technology in wastewater treatment plants this pn a process can save 60 of the aeration energy consumption without adding an organic carbon source 1 until now the pn a process has achieved good operation effects in high ammonia wastewater treatment such as sludge digestion liquid and landfill leachate 2 although the feasibility of the pn a process has been verified under mainstream conditions 3 5 it has not yet been applied for large scale mainstream treatment the stable production of nitrite no2 n and the stability of the anammox system are the key to achieving the implementation of mainstream pn a processes furthermore compared with one stage processes in a single reactor performing pn and anammox respectively in a two stage two reactor process can more easily enrich and maintain the functional bacteria ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and anammox bacteria by controlling the operating parameters in the different reactors 6 7 however there are two problems in the traditional two stage pn a process with activated sludge for treating municipal wastewater first in conventional pn activated sludge systems nitrifying bacteria nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and aob and heterotrophic bacteria often exist in the same reactor therefore in the presence of organic matter some fast growing heterotrophic bacteria are more competitive for substrates and dissolved oxygen do than the nitrifying bacteria thus adversely affecting pn 8 bao et al 9 found that when the influent chemical oxygen demand cod concentration was halved in an aerobic granular sludge reactor the nitrite accumulation rate nar of the system increased the other problem is that a higher do content in pn effluent and complex organic compounds in the municipal wastewater may adversely affect the activity and abundance of anammox bacteria 6 some studies suggest that when organic matter is present in wastewater anammox bacteria will gradually lose the competitive advantage due to their slow growth rate compared to heterotrophic bacteria thus reducing the nitrogen removal effect of anammox 10 11 however some studies have found that a low concentration of organic matter does not affect the activity of anammox bacteria and can even promote synergistic nitrogen removal through denitrifying bacteria thus improving the nitrogen removal efficiency of the system 12 13 compared with traditional suspended sludge systems granules and microbial immobilization technologies can effectively retain and enrich microorganisms in the reactor and reduce the adverse effects of the external environment on microbial activity 14 16 however anammox granules still face challenges related to size control and shape retention in municipal wastewater treatment systems immobilization technologies can effectively reduce the abundance of heterotrophic bacteria in the immobilized carrier by immobilizing a large number of functional microorganisms aob and anammox bacteria on a limited carrier therefore because there are fewer heterotrophic bacteria in the immobilized filler the overgrowth of heterotrophic bacteria is effectively reduced in addition many studies have demonstrated the existence of a do gradient in immobilized fillers 17 19 this is of great significance for achieving stable pn and reducing the adverse effect of do on anammox bacterial activity in summary immobilization technologies can effectively promote the application of the pn a process in municipal wastewater treatment however research on using this technology to achieve pn a in a system to treat municipal wastewater has not been reported in this study a two stage pn a system based on an immobilization technology was constructed and the feasibility of achieving nitrogen removal from municipal wastewater was investigated a continuous flow reactor was used to achieve pn of municipal wastewater with a pn pva gel immobilized carrier two sequencing batch reactors sbrs one with anammox granules and one with anammox immobilized carriers were separately fed with effluent from the pn reactor to compare their treatment ability the specific objectives were to 1 investigate the nitrite accumulation performance of the pn immobilized carrier in municipal wastewater 2 compare the nitrogen and organic matter removal performance of the anammox granules and anammox immobilized carrier in the pn a process and 3 study the effect of the immobilization technology on the microbial community structure of the pn a process this study will promote efficient pn a processes for mainstream wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 partial nitrification immobilized carrier reactor operation a lab scale reactor with a working volume of 10 l was used as the pn immobilized carrier continuous flow reactor fig 1 the reactor was operated at room temperature 25 1 c and the do concentration was controlled at 3 8 4 0 mg l using a do probe wtw germany in conjunction with an off on air pump with a programmable logic controller the pn immobilized carrier was prepared as per our previous research with filling rate v v of 10 20 in the seed sludge the relative abundance of nitrosomonas a known aob was 65 61 while that of nob was 0 05 the hydraulic residence time hrt was maintained at 1 0 h 2 2 set up and operation of the anammox reactors 2 2 1 preparation of immobilized anammox granules the anammox granules 2 5 3 mm were procured from an actual monosodium glutamate wastewater treatment project inner mongolia china the anammox granular sludge was crushed into smaller particles of 0 5 0 7 mm using a submersible sewage pump 40puma 2 10s tsurumi pump japan and then mixed with polyvinyl alcohol and other materials to prepare the anammox immobilized carrier according to our previous research 15 16 the anammox immobilized carrier was shaped as a cylinder of 15 mm in diameter 5 mm in height and 1 2 mm in thickness 2 2 2 anammox reactor operation two sbrs with a working volume of 0 8 l each were used as the reactors for the anammox granules ag sbr and anammox immobilized carrier ac sbr respectively fig 1 the filling rate of the ac sbr was 18 v v and the same biomass of anammox granules was added to the ag sbr the two reactors were placed in a constant temperature shaker to maintain the temperature at 30 1 c and the shaker speed was controlled at 80 rpm zhwy 2102c china the upper part of the reactor was equipped with a hole that was used for sampling and measuring ph and do while at the same time reducing the influence of oxygen in the air the sbrs operated in batch mode and each circle consisted of feeding 3 min anoxic reaction time based on the phase and settling and drainage 7 min at the beginning of each cycle the pn reactor effluent was added into the two anammox reactors to a working volume of 0 8 l at the end of each cycle the granules and carriers were intercepted using a 200 mesh screen and the effluent was discharged before the next cycle the operation of the two anammox reactors was divided into two stages phase i was the start up stage with an operation period of 8 0 h phase ii was the stable operation stage with an operation period of 6 0 h the variations in nitrogen and cod concentrations in a typical cycle of the ag sbr and ac sbr were measured 2 3 wastewater characteristics the municipal wastewater used in this study was collected from the effluent of the primary sedimentation tank of the gao bei dian municipal wastewater treatment plant beijing china the main wastewater characteristics are shown in table 1 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 wastewater quality analysis the concentrations of cod total nitrogen tn ammonium nh4 n no2 n and nitrate no3 n were analyzed according to the apha standard methods 21 the do and ph were measured with portable do and ph meters respectively hach usa 2 4 2 high throughput sequencing the illumina miseq high throughput sequencing platform illumina san diego usa was used to analyze the microbial composition of the inoculated anammox granular sludge a0 and the initial pn immobilized carrier p0 as well as the pn immobilized carrier p1 anammox granular sludge ag and anammox immobilized carrier ac collected after the operation the v3 v4 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified with primers 341f cctacgggnggcwgcag and 805r gactachvgggtatctaatcc the obtained bacterial 16s rrna gene sequences were compared with the national center for biotechnology information ncbi database the raw reads were deposited into the ncbi sequence read archive sra accession number srp401657 using megan software the 16s rrna gene sequences were analyzed and classified according to a certain threshold to obtain operation classification units otus diversity analysis was performed according to the otus and finally the results were visualized 2 5 calculations 2 5 1 calculation of the nitrite accumulation ratio in the pn immobilized carrier reactor the nitrite accumulation ratio nar of the pn immobilized carrier reactor was calculated as follows nar no 2 eff no 2 inf no 2 eff no 2 inf no 3 eff no 3 inf 100 where no2 inf and no2 eff are the no2 concentrations of influent and effluent respectively and no3 eff and no3 inf are the no3 concentrations of effluent and influent respectively 2 5 2 calculation of the nitrogen removal contribution rate in the anammox immobilized carrier reactor without considering biomass synthesis the nitrogen removal contribution of the denitrification and anammox processes in the ag sbr and ac sbr was calculated based on du et al 22 the nitrogen removal contribution rate of the anammox reactor was calculated as follows nrp anammox nh 4 1 1 32 0 26 tn inf tn eff 100 nrp denitrification 100 nrp an where nrp anammox and nrp denitrification are the proportions of anammox and denitrification respectively in nitrogen removal nh4 represents the difference in the influent and effluent ammonium concentrations and tn inf and tn eff are the tn concentrations in the influent and effluent respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrite accumulation and cod removal performance of the pn immobilized carrier reactor the nitrogen and cod concentrations in the influent and effluent of the pn immobilized carrier reactor are shown in fig 2 during operation of the pn immobilized carrier reactor with municipal wastewater the effluent ammonium and nitrite concentrations were stable at 16 2 23 3 and 22 8 34 5 mg l respectively the nar of the reactor was 90 7 95 1 indicating that the pn immobilized carrier can achieve stable pn with municipal wastewater under normal temperature conditions the oxygen limited environment formed by the high aob and low nob contents in the pn immobilized carrier were the main reasons for the pn of the municipal wastewater 20 despite fluctuations of the influent ammonium concentration 41 4 58 3 mg l the ratio of the effluent nitrite concentration to effluent ammonium concentration was maintained at 1 34 1 60 furthermore the nar of the pn immobilized carrier treating municipal wastewater was higher than that treating simulated wastewater observed in previous studies 20 this was mainly related to the higher concentration of residual ammonia nitrogen in the effluent according to the monod equation the growth rate of aob is related to the ammonium concentration in the reactor thus the residual ammonia nitrogen in the reactor can promote aob activity to increase the nar 23 24 under a cod influent concentration of 130 8 173 5 mg l and c n ratio of 2 5 3 7 the cod removal rate of the pn immobilized carrier reactor was 33 2 2 9 according to our previous research 19 removal of organic matter in municipal wastewater by the reactor mainly occurred due to heterotrophs in municipal wastewater and pn immobilized carrier promotion of the growth of heterotrophs in the pn immobilized carrier by organic matter in the municipal wastewater may intensify competition between heterotrophs and nitrifiers for do in the immobilized carrier and further enhance the oxygen limited environment thereby promoting pn some studies have suggested that a high c n ratio leads to the growth of heterotrophic bacteria resulting in suppression of aob 25 26 however in this study even under high influent c n ratios the pn immobilized carrier was not greatly affected mainly for two reasons on one hand the composition of the organic matter in the municipal wastewater is complex and the part that can be quickly used by heterotrophic bacteria is low so increasing the c n ratio could not effectively promote the growth of heterotrophic bacteria on the other hand the proportion of heterotrophic bacteria in the pn immobilized carrier is low and aob occupy the advantage even though the presence of organic matter will promote the growth of heterotrophic bacteria the immobilized filler can effectively maintain the dominance of aob over heterotrophic bacteria and effectively reduce the influence of high c n ratios on aob growth however fluctuation of the cod concentration and c n ratio in the influent did not affect the nar of the reactor but only the cod removal efficiency fig 2b suggesting that organic matter in the low c n ratio municipal wastewater did not affect nitrite accumulation in the pn immobilized carrier reactor the above results show that the pn immobilized carrier can achieve stable pn and can thus provide suitable influent conditions for the anammox reactor 3 2 nitrogen and cod removal performance of the anammox reactors 3 2 1 pollutant removal performance and nitrogen removal pathway the nitrogen removal performance of the ag sbr and ac sbr are shown in fig 3a and c respectively the ag sbr and ac sbr initially treated the effluent of the pn immobilized carrier reactor for 8 0 h after which the operation period was changed to 6 0 h the effluent no3 concentration and the nitrogen compound balance of the ag sbr and ac sbr are shown in fig 3b and d respectively in phase i after 7 days start up the ammonia removal rate arr and total nitrogen removal rate tnr of the ag sbr reached 84 0 and 76 7 respectively from 7 to 25 days the effluent quality was classified as a based on the national discharge standard criteria of china gb18918 2002 nh4 n 5 0 mg l tn 15 0 mg l this indicates that the anammox granular sludge in the high ammonia treatment system can start the anammox process using low strength municipal wastewater start up of the anammox process in the ac sbr was completed on day 10 with the arr and tnr reaching 93 9 and 83 3 respectively inhibition of the anammox bacterial activity during the cross linking of the immobilized carrier may be the main reason why the start up time was longer than that of the granular sludge 27 moreover the effluent quality was classified as a based on the stricter local discharge standard criteria of beijing china after 10 days of start up db11 890 2012 nh4 n 1 5 mg l tn 10 0 mg l many studies have shown that the beneficial microenvironment of the immobilized carrier can promote the active expression of anammox bacteria 15 16 19 20 28 thereby explaining why the ac sbr can achieve higher effluent quality than the ag sbr after initiation during phase ii 26 55 d the operation period was decreased to 6 0 h to increase the influent load thereby decreasing the average nrr and average tnr of the ag sbr to 64 1 5 1 and 59 4 3 4 respectively this indicates that the anammox granular sludge cannot adapt to the inflow loading rate of municipal wastewater wang et al 29 also found that a short hrt resulted in lower anammox granular sludge activity when treating low strength sewage however the ac sbr showed a more stable nitrogen removal performance than the ag sbr under the high inflow loading and the effluent quality still met the local discharge standard criteria studies have also shown that under adverse environments immobilized systems have a better nitrogen removal performance than sludge systems 15 16 30 accordingly the ac sbr showed a better nitrogen removal performance than the ag sbr treating municipal wastewater in the pn a process based on the anammox reaction equation the required stoichiometric ratios of no2 n to nh4 n and no3 n to nh4 n should be 1 32 and 0 26 respectively 31 after the ag sbr start up the average no2 n nh4 n value was 1 84 0 17 which is higher than the theoretical value of 1 32 while the average no3 n nh4 n value 0 30 0 08 was higher fig 3b this phenomenon was caused by the effect of aerobic denitrification which caused the no3 n concentration in the effluent of the ag sbr to be significantly higher than that of the ac sbr p 0 05 fig 3b and d after the ac sbr start up the average no2 n nh4 n value was 1 42 0 09 which was lower than that of the ag sbr and slightly higher than the theoretical value the average no3 n nh4 n value was 0 11 0 03 which is higher than the theoretical value indicating the existence of the denitrification process in the ac sbr the reason for the different denitrification pathways in the ag sbr and ac sbr will be analyzed in section 3 2 2 the cod removal performance and influent c n ratio of the ag sbr and ac sbr are shown in fig 4a the average cod removal rate of the ag sbr was 49 1 4 4 which was higher than that of the ac sbr 36 6 5 7 aerobic denitrification in the ag sbr enhanced cod removal the presence of cod and high do in the influent may lead to the inhibition of anammox bacteria and the acceleration of aerobic denitrification reproduction since the pn reactor removed some organic matter the influent c n ratio of the ac sbr and ag sbr decreased to 1 5 2 7 the average nitrogen removal contribution of denitrification in the ac sbr and ag sbr was 13 9 3 1 and 19 8 4 1 fig 4b and c respectively indicating that a good balance was maintained between anammox bacteria and denitrifying bacteria the optimal c n ratio of anammox for synergistic denitrification is generally 0 5 1 0 32 because organic matter in municipal sewage is complex and not easily used by denitrifying bacteria the overgrowth of denitrifying bacteria was effectively reduced even at higher c n ratios it is worth noting that the increased influent load only affected the nitrogen removal efficiency of the anammox granules and immobilized carriers whereas the nitrogen removal pathway was not affected the main reason for this phenomenon may be that most of the readily biodegradable organic matter in the municipal wastewater was removed in the pn reactor so even under the high c n ratio conditions the denitrifying bacteria had a low utilization rate for the refractory organic matter resulting in weakened denitrification moreover the lower nitrogen removal contribution of denitrification in the immobilized carriers indicates that the immobilization technology can enhance the dominance of anammox bacteria in the ac sbr leaving denitrifying bacteria in a non dominant position wang et al 32 also found that immobilized carriers have high tolerance to cod in domestic wastewater thus these results indicate that the immobilized carriers can enhance the application of anammox in municipal wastewater 3 2 2 typical operating cycle tests next the degradation of organic matter and changes in the inorganic nitrogen and do of the ag sbr and ac sbr during a typical cycle were examined fig 5a and c in the 0 2 h stage of the ag sbr reaction excessive consumption of no2 n and excessive accumulation of no3 n occurred and the concentration of consumed no2 n was higher than the concentration of accumulated no3 n the decrease in do and cod concentrations indicates that aerobic denitrification occurred in the ag sbr high throughput results demonstrated an increased abundance of heterotrophic nitrifying and aerobic denitrifying bacteria fig 7b heterotrophic nitrifying and aerobic denitrifying bacteria have a stronger affinity for do than autotrophic bacteria nob therefore the nitrification of nob was weak even under high do conditions high throughput sequencing results demonstrate that the abundance of nob was only 0 10 which is much lower than the 28 00 observed for heterotrophic nitrifying and aerobic denitrifying bacteria indicating that nitrification by nob was not the main cause of the excessive accumulation of no3 in the ag sbr nitrate accumulation during no2 n degradation via aerobic denitrification has also been previously reported 33 34 although heterotrophic nitrifying and aerobic denitrifying bacteria can only achieve efficient heterotrophic nitrification under a high c n ratio 35 36 aerobic denitrification often occurs simultaneously with heterotrophic nitrification so heterotrophic nitrification may be the main cause of the excessive no3 accumulation the nh4 n removal rate was not affected by the lower do concentration during the whole reaction cycle which indicates that the removal of ammonia nitrogen was mainly through the anammox pathway in the 2 6 h stage of the reaction due to the low do concentration and the presence of cod the 1 5 mg l of no3 n that was produced by anammox pathway was removed via denitrification therefore the denitrification in the 2 6 h stage had little effect on the nitrogen removal efficiency of the anammox granular sludge while the aerobic denitrification in the 0 2 h stage caused by the high do and organic matter in the effluent of the pn reactor was the main influencing factor because immobilization can effectively reduce the transfer of oxygen in the carrier 37 no significant nitrification was observed in the ac sbr during a typical operating cycle fig 5b in the 0 2 h stage of the ac sbr reaction due to the high do concentration in the influent organic matter consumption by heterotrophic bacteria was the main reason for the decreased cod concentration at this time there was no obvious denitrification in the ag sbr due to the negative effect of the high do concentration on denitrifying bacteria in the 2 6 h stage of the ac sbr reaction with the decreased do concentration denitrification in the ac sbr gradually increased and the nitrate removal by denitrification was 3 9 mg l for the ac sbr the final inorganic nitrogen concentrations nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were lower than those of the ag sbr while the final do and cod concentrations were higher indicating that the immobilization technology effectively reduced the negative impacts of do and organic matter in municipal wastewater on the activity of anammox bacteria the results of the typical cycle test show that the different effects of the influent do and cod concentrations on the ag sbr and ac sbr were the main reasons for the different denitrification pathways 3 3 microbial community structure of the pn a process 3 3 1 microbial diversity and richness of the pn a process high throughput sequencing analysis revealed otus and diversity indices changes in the five samples table 2 in general the municipal wastewater operation increased the population diversity the organic matter in the municipal wastewater promoted the growth of heterotrophic bacteria in the pn immobilized carrier while the do and organic matter of the pn reactor effluent served as substrates for the various microbial populations in the ag sbr and ac sbr however the simpson index of ac sample was lower than that of ag sample suggesting a more diverse community composition in addition the ace index and chao1 indices of ac were higher than those of ag suggesting that the municipal wastewater may promote the enrichment of anammox related populations in the ac sbr while the growth of miscellaneous bacteria in the ag sbr weakened the advantage of anammox bacteria these results may also explain the higher nrr and tnr values of the ac sbr 3 3 2 community structure of the pn immobilized carrier the microbial community structure changes of the pn immobilized carrier under municipal wastewater conditions was investigated by high throughput sequencing analysis at the phylum level the dominant bacteria in the pn immobilized carrier reactor were proteobacteria 60 7 50 4 bacteroidetes 15 7 25 1 chloroflexi 5 7 6 3 and verrucomicrobia 1 7 7 8 fig 6a among them proteobacteria is an important phylum related to nitrogen removal the relative abundance of bacteroidetes members of which metabolize carbohydrates and degrade complex organic matter increased in the pn immobilized carrier 38 thus the growth of these microorganisms was facilitated by organic matter in the municipal wastewater after municipal wastewater treatment nitrosomonas 26 1 was the most abundant microorganism detected in the pn immobilized carrier fig 6b which indicates that even in the presence of organic matter the immobilization technology can effectively maintain the dominance of aob relative to heterotrophs the observed decrease in the relative abundance of nitrosomonas was mainly caused by the slow growth of aob due to the low ammonia concentration in the municipal wastewater nitrospira was the dominant nob with the content increasing from 0 04 to 0 10 after operation the contents of the nob affiliated genera nitrobacter and nitrolancea decreased from 0 01 and 0 05 respectively to not be detected nitrospira has better substrate affinity than nitrobacter and nitrolancea 32 therefore nitrospira became the dominant nob in the pn immobilized carrier under the low substrate concentration of the municipal wastewater these results indicate that the pn immobilized carrier can maintain a low nob content in summary the pn immobilized carrier can effectively reduce the growth of nob while maintaining aob dominance 3 3 3 community structure of the anammox reactors to investigate the microbial community structure changes of the ag sbr and ac sbr after municipal wastewater treatment the microbial structure at phylum level was examined for taxa with relative abundances 0 1 fig 7a at the phylum level planctomycetes 41 36 which is affiliated with anammox bacteria was dominant in a0 after 55 days of municipal wastewater operation the bacterial composition of ag and ac changed with proteobacteria becoming the dominant bacteria phylum of both samples accounting for 50 36 and 30 61 respectively proteobacteria contains a variety of heterotrophic bacteria and organic matter in municipal wastewater inevitably promotes their growth in anammox systems chloroflexi and bacteroidetes are thought to be involved in the formation of sludge granules 39 the decreased proportion of these two phyla in ag after operation may be responsible for disintegration of the anammox granular sludge fig 7c and d the variation dominant microbial genera are shown in fig 7b compared with ac the municipal wastewater treatment operation changed the microbial community structure of ag to a greater extent a0 was the sample before ag operation and simultaneously acted as the inoculated sludge of ac so a0 represents the microbial community structure before ag and ac operation candidatus kuenenia was the dominant genus of anammox bacteria in a0 37 02 after municipal wastewater operation the relative abundance in ag was 1 50 while that in ac was 19 26 anammox genera also included candidatus brocadia and its proportion in ag and ac decreased to 0 15 and 1 05 respectively since the immobilized carrier has a longer srt and can reduce the adverse effects of the external environment it is more conducive to maintaining the abundance and dominance of anammox bacteria which are a slow growing and environmentally sensitive bacterial group however low strength municipal wastewater still led to a decreased abundance of anammox genera in the ac these data support the present observation that the tnr of the ac sbr was higher than that of the ag sbr denitrifying bacteria are also key functional bacteria in anammox systems due to the influence of do and organic matter in the effluent of the pn reactor the genus acinetobacter which is associated with aerobic denitrification function 33 34 became the dominant 28 00 in ag this supported the present conclusion section 3 2 2 that denitrification in the ag sbr was mainly aerobic denitrification in addition the relative abundances of nitrosomonas and nitrospira which are autotrophic nitrifying bacteria decreased in ag due to the influence of aerobic denitrification compared with ag the main denitrifying genus in ac was aridibacter 11 37 which has been shown to participate in denitrification under anoxic conditions using nitrate as an electron acceptor 40 the decreased relative abundances of nitrosomonas and nitrospira in ac also demonstrate the presence of an anoxic environment in the immobilized carrier these results indicate that the difference in the do environment between the anammox immobilized carrier and the anammox granular sludge is the main reason for the varying structure of denitrifying bacteria in ag and ac therefore the ac sbr exhibited a better nitrogen removal performance than the ag sbr in the two stage pn a process in addition color is considered to be an intuitive and important indicator reflecting the activity of anammox granular sludge 41 for ag most of the red granules and a small part of dark brown granules transitioned to black granules after municipal wastewater treatment fig 7c and d red anammox granular sludge is generally considered to have a higher abundance of anammox bacteria while black sludge is considered to have a higher abundance of heterotrophic bacteria therefore the color change of ag is consistent with its microbial structure change 3 4 characteristics of the mainstream pn a process by gel immobilization stable pn and maintenance of anammox bacterial activity are crucial to the stability of the pn a process treating municipal wastewater in this study the pn immobilized carrier achieved stable pn and provided suitable influent conditions for the anammox reactor furthermore the pn reactor could degrade organic matter in the municipal wastewater which can effectively reduce the adverse effects of organic matter on the anammox system compared with the anammox granular sludge higher anammox bacterial activity and tnr was achieved by using anammox granular sludge as an immobilized carrier in the pn a system this is due to the use of an immobilization technology to effectively reduce the adverse effects caused by do and organic matter in the effluent of the pn reactor on the anammox system results show that 83 4 1 5 of the tn was removed by this two stage immobilized carrier pn a system resulting in good effluent quality the pn a process by gel immobilization has two advantages in practical engineering applications the first is that the immobilized carrier has good settling performance so it only needs a single reactor without a sedimentation tank the second due to the high abundance of functional bacteria in the immobilized carrier is that it can effectively improve the treatment capacity of wastewater treatment plants future research should explore the structural stability of the immobilized carriers for long term operation and the stability of the two stage immobilized carrier pn a system under actual mainstream conditions which exhibits fluctuating water flow low temperature and other varying conditions 4 conclusions a novel two stage pn a system employing gel immobilization was developed to treat municipal wastewater the resulting tn removal efficiency reached 83 4 1 5 and the nitrogen concentration in effluent met local water quality discharge standards stable pn with a high nar of 90 7 95 1 and a cod removal rate of 33 2 2 9 provided suitable influent conditions for the anammox reactor the ac sbr exhibited better a nitrogen removal performance than the ag sbr during the pn a process the immobilized carrier can effectively reduce the adverse effects of do and organic matter from the pn reactor effluent on anammox system which were the main factors affecting the denitrification pathways of the ag sbr and ac sbr the pn immobilized carrier can effectively reduce the growth of nob while maintaining the dominance of aob and the anammox immobilized carrier maintained the dominance of the functional bacteria candidatus kuenenia this study confirms the feasibility of using gel immobilization to achieve advanced nitrogen removal from municipal wastewater via the pn a process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

12765,this study focused on treating municipal wastewater using a novel two stage partial nitritation anammox pn a process by gel immobilization the first stage employed a pn immobilized carrier reactor in which the nitrite accumulation rate was 90 7 95 1 and the cod removal rate was 33 2 2 9 the second stage comprised an anammox based sequencing batch reactor sbr fed with the effluent from the first stage two second stage sbrs were tested to compare their treatment effect one contained anammox granules ag sbr and one contained anammox immobilized carriers ac sbr the ac sbr exhibited better nitrogen removal performance than the ag sbr during the pn a process with the nitrogen removal rate of ac sbr being 83 4 1 5 the gel immobilization technology effectively reduced the adverse effects of dissolved oxygen and organic matter in the pn reactor effluent on the anammox system aerobic denitrification was observed in the ag sbr in the pn immobilized carrier nitrospira was the dominant nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob with a relative abundance of 0 10 indicating that the growth of nob was effectively inhibited in municipal wastewater candidatus kuenenia was the dominant genus of anammox bacteria exhibiting a relative abundance of 1 50 and 19 26 in the ag sbr and ac sbr respectively thus the pn a process by gel immobilization is an effective treatment for municipal wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords anammox granules anammox immobilized carrier gel immobilization municipal wastewater two stage pn a process data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the partial nitritation anammox pn a process is an ideal energy saving and resource recovery technology in wastewater treatment plants this pn a process can save 60 of the aeration energy consumption without adding an organic carbon source 1 until now the pn a process has achieved good operation effects in high ammonia wastewater treatment such as sludge digestion liquid and landfill leachate 2 although the feasibility of the pn a process has been verified under mainstream conditions 3 5 it has not yet been applied for large scale mainstream treatment the stable production of nitrite no2 n and the stability of the anammox system are the key to achieving the implementation of mainstream pn a processes furthermore compared with one stage processes in a single reactor performing pn and anammox respectively in a two stage two reactor process can more easily enrich and maintain the functional bacteria ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and anammox bacteria by controlling the operating parameters in the different reactors 6 7 however there are two problems in the traditional two stage pn a process with activated sludge for treating municipal wastewater first in conventional pn activated sludge systems nitrifying bacteria nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and aob and heterotrophic bacteria often exist in the same reactor therefore in the presence of organic matter some fast growing heterotrophic bacteria are more competitive for substrates and dissolved oxygen do than the nitrifying bacteria thus adversely affecting pn 8 bao et al 9 found that when the influent chemical oxygen demand cod concentration was halved in an aerobic granular sludge reactor the nitrite accumulation rate nar of the system increased the other problem is that a higher do content in pn effluent and complex organic compounds in the municipal wastewater may adversely affect the activity and abundance of anammox bacteria 6 some studies suggest that when organic matter is present in wastewater anammox bacteria will gradually lose the competitive advantage due to their slow growth rate compared to heterotrophic bacteria thus reducing the nitrogen removal effect of anammox 10 11 however some studies have found that a low concentration of organic matter does not affect the activity of anammox bacteria and can even promote synergistic nitrogen removal through denitrifying bacteria thus improving the nitrogen removal efficiency of the system 12 13 compared with traditional suspended sludge systems granules and microbial immobilization technologies can effectively retain and enrich microorganisms in the reactor and reduce the adverse effects of the external environment on microbial activity 14 16 however anammox granules still face challenges related to size control and shape retention in municipal wastewater treatment systems immobilization technologies can effectively reduce the abundance of heterotrophic bacteria in the immobilized carrier by immobilizing a large number of functional microorganisms aob and anammox bacteria on a limited carrier therefore because there are fewer heterotrophic bacteria in the immobilized filler the overgrowth of heterotrophic bacteria is effectively reduced in addition many studies have demonstrated the existence of a do gradient in immobilized fillers 17 19 this is of great significance for achieving stable pn and reducing the adverse effect of do on anammox bacterial activity in summary immobilization technologies can effectively promote the application of the pn a process in municipal wastewater treatment however research on using this technology to achieve pn a in a system to treat municipal wastewater has not been reported in this study a two stage pn a system based on an immobilization technology was constructed and the feasibility of achieving nitrogen removal from municipal wastewater was investigated a continuous flow reactor was used to achieve pn of municipal wastewater with a pn pva gel immobilized carrier two sequencing batch reactors sbrs one with anammox granules and one with anammox immobilized carriers were separately fed with effluent from the pn reactor to compare their treatment ability the specific objectives were to 1 investigate the nitrite accumulation performance of the pn immobilized carrier in municipal wastewater 2 compare the nitrogen and organic matter removal performance of the anammox granules and anammox immobilized carrier in the pn a process and 3 study the effect of the immobilization technology on the microbial community structure of the pn a process this study will promote efficient pn a processes for mainstream wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 partial nitrification immobilized carrier reactor operation a lab scale reactor with a working volume of 10 l was used as the pn immobilized carrier continuous flow reactor fig 1 the reactor was operated at room temperature 25 1 c and the do concentration was controlled at 3 8 4 0 mg l using a do probe wtw germany in conjunction with an off on air pump with a programmable logic controller the pn immobilized carrier was prepared as per our previous research with filling rate v v of 10 20 in the seed sludge the relative abundance of nitrosomonas a known aob was 65 61 while that of nob was 0 05 the hydraulic residence time hrt was maintained at 1 0 h 2 2 set up and operation of the anammox reactors 2 2 1 preparation of immobilized anammox granules the anammox granules 2 5 3 mm were procured from an actual monosodium glutamate wastewater treatment project inner mongolia china the anammox granular sludge was crushed into smaller particles of 0 5 0 7 mm using a submersible sewage pump 40puma 2 10s tsurumi pump japan and then mixed with polyvinyl alcohol and other materials to prepare the anammox immobilized carrier according to our previous research 15 16 the anammox immobilized carrier was shaped as a cylinder of 15 mm in diameter 5 mm in height and 1 2 mm in thickness 2 2 2 anammox reactor operation two sbrs with a working volume of 0 8 l each were used as the reactors for the anammox granules ag sbr and anammox immobilized carrier ac sbr respectively fig 1 the filling rate of the ac sbr was 18 v v and the same biomass of anammox granules was added to the ag sbr the two reactors were placed in a constant temperature shaker to maintain the temperature at 30 1 c and the shaker speed was controlled at 80 rpm zhwy 2102c china the upper part of the reactor was equipped with a hole that was used for sampling and measuring ph and do while at the same time reducing the influence of oxygen in the air the sbrs operated in batch mode and each circle consisted of feeding 3 min anoxic reaction time based on the phase and settling and drainage 7 min at the beginning of each cycle the pn reactor effluent was added into the two anammox reactors to a working volume of 0 8 l at the end of each cycle the granules and carriers were intercepted using a 200 mesh screen and the effluent was discharged before the next cycle the operation of the two anammox reactors was divided into two stages phase i was the start up stage with an operation period of 8 0 h phase ii was the stable operation stage with an operation period of 6 0 h the variations in nitrogen and cod concentrations in a typical cycle of the ag sbr and ac sbr were measured 2 3 wastewater characteristics the municipal wastewater used in this study was collected from the effluent of the primary sedimentation tank of the gao bei dian municipal wastewater treatment plant beijing china the main wastewater characteristics are shown in table 1 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 wastewater quality analysis the concentrations of cod total nitrogen tn ammonium nh4 n no2 n and nitrate no3 n were analyzed according to the apha standard methods 21 the do and ph were measured with portable do and ph meters respectively hach usa 2 4 2 high throughput sequencing the illumina miseq high throughput sequencing platform illumina san diego usa was used to analyze the microbial composition of the inoculated anammox granular sludge a0 and the initial pn immobilized carrier p0 as well as the pn immobilized carrier p1 anammox granular sludge ag and anammox immobilized carrier ac collected after the operation the v3 v4 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified with primers 341f cctacgggnggcwgcag and 805r gactachvgggtatctaatcc the obtained bacterial 16s rrna gene sequences were compared with the national center for biotechnology information ncbi database the raw reads were deposited into the ncbi sequence read archive sra accession number srp401657 using megan software the 16s rrna gene sequences were analyzed and classified according to a certain threshold to obtain operation classification units otus diversity analysis was performed according to the otus and finally the results were visualized 2 5 calculations 2 5 1 calculation of the nitrite accumulation ratio in the pn immobilized carrier reactor the nitrite accumulation ratio nar of the pn immobilized carrier reactor was calculated as follows nar no 2 eff no 2 inf no 2 eff no 2 inf no 3 eff no 3 inf 100 where no2 inf and no2 eff are the no2 concentrations of influent and effluent respectively and no3 eff and no3 inf are the no3 concentrations of effluent and influent respectively 2 5 2 calculation of the nitrogen removal contribution rate in the anammox immobilized carrier reactor without considering biomass synthesis the nitrogen removal contribution of the denitrification and anammox processes in the ag sbr and ac sbr was calculated based on du et al 22 the nitrogen removal contribution rate of the anammox reactor was calculated as follows nrp anammox nh 4 1 1 32 0 26 tn inf tn eff 100 nrp denitrification 100 nrp an where nrp anammox and nrp denitrification are the proportions of anammox and denitrification respectively in nitrogen removal nh4 represents the difference in the influent and effluent ammonium concentrations and tn inf and tn eff are the tn concentrations in the influent and effluent respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrite accumulation and cod removal performance of the pn immobilized carrier reactor the nitrogen and cod concentrations in the influent and effluent of the pn immobilized carrier reactor are shown in fig 2 during operation of the pn immobilized carrier reactor with municipal wastewater the effluent ammonium and nitrite concentrations were stable at 16 2 23 3 and 22 8 34 5 mg l respectively the nar of the reactor was 90 7 95 1 indicating that the pn immobilized carrier can achieve stable pn with municipal wastewater under normal temperature conditions the oxygen limited environment formed by the high aob and low nob contents in the pn immobilized carrier were the main reasons for the pn of the municipal wastewater 20 despite fluctuations of the influent ammonium concentration 41 4 58 3 mg l the ratio of the effluent nitrite concentration to effluent ammonium concentration was maintained at 1 34 1 60 furthermore the nar of the pn immobilized carrier treating municipal wastewater was higher than that treating simulated wastewater observed in previous studies 20 this was mainly related to the higher concentration of residual ammonia nitrogen in the effluent according to the monod equation the growth rate of aob is related to the ammonium concentration in the reactor thus the residual ammonia nitrogen in the reactor can promote aob activity to increase the nar 23 24 under a cod influent concentration of 130 8 173 5 mg l and c n ratio of 2 5 3 7 the cod removal rate of the pn immobilized carrier reactor was 33 2 2 9 according to our previous research 19 removal of organic matter in municipal wastewater by the reactor mainly occurred due to heterotrophs in municipal wastewater and pn immobilized carrier promotion of the growth of heterotrophs in the pn immobilized carrier by organic matter in the municipal wastewater may intensify competition between heterotrophs and nitrifiers for do in the immobilized carrier and further enhance the oxygen limited environment thereby promoting pn some studies have suggested that a high c n ratio leads to the growth of heterotrophic bacteria resulting in suppression of aob 25 26 however in this study even under high influent c n ratios the pn immobilized carrier was not greatly affected mainly for two reasons on one hand the composition of the organic matter in the municipal wastewater is complex and the part that can be quickly used by heterotrophic bacteria is low so increasing the c n ratio could not effectively promote the growth of heterotrophic bacteria on the other hand the proportion of heterotrophic bacteria in the pn immobilized carrier is low and aob occupy the advantage even though the presence of organic matter will promote the growth of heterotrophic bacteria the immobilized filler can effectively maintain the dominance of aob over heterotrophic bacteria and effectively reduce the influence of high c n ratios on aob growth however fluctuation of the cod concentration and c n ratio in the influent did not affect the nar of the reactor but only the cod removal efficiency fig 2b suggesting that organic matter in the low c n ratio municipal wastewater did not affect nitrite accumulation in the pn immobilized carrier reactor the above results show that the pn immobilized carrier can achieve stable pn and can thus provide suitable influent conditions for the anammox reactor 3 2 nitrogen and cod removal performance of the anammox reactors 3 2 1 pollutant removal performance and nitrogen removal pathway the nitrogen removal performance of the ag sbr and ac sbr are shown in fig 3a and c respectively the ag sbr and ac sbr initially treated the effluent of the pn immobilized carrier reactor for 8 0 h after which the operation period was changed to 6 0 h the effluent no3 concentration and the nitrogen compound balance of the ag sbr and ac sbr are shown in fig 3b and d respectively in phase i after 7 days start up the ammonia removal rate arr and total nitrogen removal rate tnr of the ag sbr reached 84 0 and 76 7 respectively from 7 to 25 days the effluent quality was classified as a based on the national discharge standard criteria of china gb18918 2002 nh4 n 5 0 mg l tn 15 0 mg l this indicates that the anammox granular sludge in the high ammonia treatment system can start the anammox process using low strength municipal wastewater start up of the anammox process in the ac sbr was completed on day 10 with the arr and tnr reaching 93 9 and 83 3 respectively inhibition of the anammox bacterial activity during the cross linking of the immobilized carrier may be the main reason why the start up time was longer than that of the granular sludge 27 moreover the effluent quality was classified as a based on the stricter local discharge standard criteria of beijing china after 10 days of start up db11 890 2012 nh4 n 1 5 mg l tn 10 0 mg l many studies have shown that the beneficial microenvironment of the immobilized carrier can promote the active expression of anammox bacteria 15 16 19 20 28 thereby explaining why the ac sbr can achieve higher effluent quality than the ag sbr after initiation during phase ii 26 55 d the operation period was decreased to 6 0 h to increase the influent load thereby decreasing the average nrr and average tnr of the ag sbr to 64 1 5 1 and 59 4 3 4 respectively this indicates that the anammox granular sludge cannot adapt to the inflow loading rate of municipal wastewater wang et al 29 also found that a short hrt resulted in lower anammox granular sludge activity when treating low strength sewage however the ac sbr showed a more stable nitrogen removal performance than the ag sbr under the high inflow loading and the effluent quality still met the local discharge standard criteria studies have also shown that under adverse environments immobilized systems have a better nitrogen removal performance than sludge systems 15 16 30 accordingly the ac sbr showed a better nitrogen removal performance than the ag sbr treating municipal wastewater in the pn a process based on the anammox reaction equation the required stoichiometric ratios of no2 n to nh4 n and no3 n to nh4 n should be 1 32 and 0 26 respectively 31 after the ag sbr start up the average no2 n nh4 n value was 1 84 0 17 which is higher than the theoretical value of 1 32 while the average no3 n nh4 n value 0 30 0 08 was higher fig 3b this phenomenon was caused by the effect of aerobic denitrification which caused the no3 n concentration in the effluent of the ag sbr to be significantly higher than that of the ac sbr p 0 05 fig 3b and d after the ac sbr start up the average no2 n nh4 n value was 1 42 0 09 which was lower than that of the ag sbr and slightly higher than the theoretical value the average no3 n nh4 n value was 0 11 0 03 which is higher than the theoretical value indicating the existence of the denitrification process in the ac sbr the reason for the different denitrification pathways in the ag sbr and ac sbr will be analyzed in section 3 2 2 the cod removal performance and influent c n ratio of the ag sbr and ac sbr are shown in fig 4a the average cod removal rate of the ag sbr was 49 1 4 4 which was higher than that of the ac sbr 36 6 5 7 aerobic denitrification in the ag sbr enhanced cod removal the presence of cod and high do in the influent may lead to the inhibition of anammox bacteria and the acceleration of aerobic denitrification reproduction since the pn reactor removed some organic matter the influent c n ratio of the ac sbr and ag sbr decreased to 1 5 2 7 the average nitrogen removal contribution of denitrification in the ac sbr and ag sbr was 13 9 3 1 and 19 8 4 1 fig 4b and c respectively indicating that a good balance was maintained between anammox bacteria and denitrifying bacteria the optimal c n ratio of anammox for synergistic denitrification is generally 0 5 1 0 32 because organic matter in municipal sewage is complex and not easily used by denitrifying bacteria the overgrowth of denitrifying bacteria was effectively reduced even at higher c n ratios it is worth noting that the increased influent load only affected the nitrogen removal efficiency of the anammox granules and immobilized carriers whereas the nitrogen removal pathway was not affected the main reason for this phenomenon may be that most of the readily biodegradable organic matter in the municipal wastewater was removed in the pn reactor so even under the high c n ratio conditions the denitrifying bacteria had a low utilization rate for the refractory organic matter resulting in weakened denitrification moreover the lower nitrogen removal contribution of denitrification in the immobilized carriers indicates that the immobilization technology can enhance the dominance of anammox bacteria in the ac sbr leaving denitrifying bacteria in a non dominant position wang et al 32 also found that immobilized carriers have high tolerance to cod in domestic wastewater thus these results indicate that the immobilized carriers can enhance the application of anammox in municipal wastewater 3 2 2 typical operating cycle tests next the degradation of organic matter and changes in the inorganic nitrogen and do of the ag sbr and ac sbr during a typical cycle were examined fig 5a and c in the 0 2 h stage of the ag sbr reaction excessive consumption of no2 n and excessive accumulation of no3 n occurred and the concentration of consumed no2 n was higher than the concentration of accumulated no3 n the decrease in do and cod concentrations indicates that aerobic denitrification occurred in the ag sbr high throughput results demonstrated an increased abundance of heterotrophic nitrifying and aerobic denitrifying bacteria fig 7b heterotrophic nitrifying and aerobic denitrifying bacteria have a stronger affinity for do than autotrophic bacteria nob therefore the nitrification of nob was weak even under high do conditions high throughput sequencing results demonstrate that the abundance of nob was only 0 10 which is much lower than the 28 00 observed for heterotrophic nitrifying and aerobic denitrifying bacteria indicating that nitrification by nob was not the main cause of the excessive accumulation of no3 in the ag sbr nitrate accumulation during no2 n degradation via aerobic denitrification has also been previously reported 33 34 although heterotrophic nitrifying and aerobic denitrifying bacteria can only achieve efficient heterotrophic nitrification under a high c n ratio 35 36 aerobic denitrification often occurs simultaneously with heterotrophic nitrification so heterotrophic nitrification may be the main cause of the excessive no3 accumulation the nh4 n removal rate was not affected by the lower do concentration during the whole reaction cycle which indicates that the removal of ammonia nitrogen was mainly through the anammox pathway in the 2 6 h stage of the reaction due to the low do concentration and the presence of cod the 1 5 mg l of no3 n that was produced by anammox pathway was removed via denitrification therefore the denitrification in the 2 6 h stage had little effect on the nitrogen removal efficiency of the anammox granular sludge while the aerobic denitrification in the 0 2 h stage caused by the high do and organic matter in the effluent of the pn reactor was the main influencing factor because immobilization can effectively reduce the transfer of oxygen in the carrier 37 no significant nitrification was observed in the ac sbr during a typical operating cycle fig 5b in the 0 2 h stage of the ac sbr reaction due to the high do concentration in the influent organic matter consumption by heterotrophic bacteria was the main reason for the decreased cod concentration at this time there was no obvious denitrification in the ag sbr due to the negative effect of the high do concentration on denitrifying bacteria in the 2 6 h stage of the ac sbr reaction with the decreased do concentration denitrification in the ac sbr gradually increased and the nitrate removal by denitrification was 3 9 mg l for the ac sbr the final inorganic nitrogen concentrations nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were lower than those of the ag sbr while the final do and cod concentrations were higher indicating that the immobilization technology effectively reduced the negative impacts of do and organic matter in municipal wastewater on the activity of anammox bacteria the results of the typical cycle test show that the different effects of the influent do and cod concentrations on the ag sbr and ac sbr were the main reasons for the different denitrification pathways 3 3 microbial community structure of the pn a process 3 3 1 microbial diversity and richness of the pn a process high throughput sequencing analysis revealed otus and diversity indices changes in the five samples table 2 in general the municipal wastewater operation increased the population diversity the organic matter in the municipal wastewater promoted the growth of heterotrophic bacteria in the pn immobilized carrier while the do and organic matter of the pn reactor effluent served as substrates for the various microbial populations in the ag sbr and ac sbr however the simpson index of ac sample was lower than that of ag sample suggesting a more diverse community composition in addition the ace index and chao1 indices of ac were higher than those of ag suggesting that the municipal wastewater may promote the enrichment of anammox related populations in the ac sbr while the growth of miscellaneous bacteria in the ag sbr weakened the advantage of anammox bacteria these results may also explain the higher nrr and tnr values of the ac sbr 3 3 2 community structure of the pn immobilized carrier the microbial community structure changes of the pn immobilized carrier under municipal wastewater conditions was investigated by high throughput sequencing analysis at the phylum level the dominant bacteria in the pn immobilized carrier reactor were proteobacteria 60 7 50 4 bacteroidetes 15 7 25 1 chloroflexi 5 7 6 3 and verrucomicrobia 1 7 7 8 fig 6a among them proteobacteria is an important phylum related to nitrogen removal the relative abundance of bacteroidetes members of which metabolize carbohydrates and degrade complex organic matter increased in the pn immobilized carrier 38 thus the growth of these microorganisms was facilitated by organic matter in the municipal wastewater after municipal wastewater treatment nitrosomonas 26 1 was the most abundant microorganism detected in the pn immobilized carrier fig 6b which indicates that even in the presence of organic matter the immobilization technology can effectively maintain the dominance of aob relative to heterotrophs the observed decrease in the relative abundance of nitrosomonas was mainly caused by the slow growth of aob due to the low ammonia concentration in the municipal wastewater nitrospira was the dominant nob with the content increasing from 0 04 to 0 10 after operation the contents of the nob affiliated genera nitrobacter and nitrolancea decreased from 0 01 and 0 05 respectively to not be detected nitrospira has better substrate affinity than nitrobacter and nitrolancea 32 therefore nitrospira became the dominant nob in the pn immobilized carrier under the low substrate concentration of the municipal wastewater these results indicate that the pn immobilized carrier can maintain a low nob content in summary the pn immobilized carrier can effectively reduce the growth of nob while maintaining aob dominance 3 3 3 community structure of the anammox reactors to investigate the microbial community structure changes of the ag sbr and ac sbr after municipal wastewater treatment the microbial structure at phylum level was examined for taxa with relative abundances 0 1 fig 7a at the phylum level planctomycetes 41 36 which is affiliated with anammox bacteria was dominant in a0 after 55 days of municipal wastewater operation the bacterial composition of ag and ac changed with proteobacteria becoming the dominant bacteria phylum of both samples accounting for 50 36 and 30 61 respectively proteobacteria contains a variety of heterotrophic bacteria and organic matter in municipal wastewater inevitably promotes their growth in anammox systems chloroflexi and bacteroidetes are thought to be involved in the formation of sludge granules 39 the decreased proportion of these two phyla in ag after operation may be responsible for disintegration of the anammox granular sludge fig 7c and d the variation dominant microbial genera are shown in fig 7b compared with ac the municipal wastewater treatment operation changed the microbial community structure of ag to a greater extent a0 was the sample before ag operation and simultaneously acted as the inoculated sludge of ac so a0 represents the microbial community structure before ag and ac operation candidatus kuenenia was the dominant genus of anammox bacteria in a0 37 02 after municipal wastewater operation the relative abundance in ag was 1 50 while that in ac was 19 26 anammox genera also included candidatus brocadia and its proportion in ag and ac decreased to 0 15 and 1 05 respectively since the immobilized carrier has a longer srt and can reduce the adverse effects of the external environment it is more conducive to maintaining the abundance and dominance of anammox bacteria which are a slow growing and environmentally sensitive bacterial group however low strength municipal wastewater still led to a decreased abundance of anammox genera in the ac these data support the present observation that the tnr of the ac sbr was higher than that of the ag sbr denitrifying bacteria are also key functional bacteria in anammox systems due to the influence of do and organic matter in the effluent of the pn reactor the genus acinetobacter which is associated with aerobic denitrification function 33 34 became the dominant 28 00 in ag this supported the present conclusion section 3 2 2 that denitrification in the ag sbr was mainly aerobic denitrification in addition the relative abundances of nitrosomonas and nitrospira which are autotrophic nitrifying bacteria decreased in ag due to the influence of aerobic denitrification compared with ag the main denitrifying genus in ac was aridibacter 11 37 which has been shown to participate in denitrification under anoxic conditions using nitrate as an electron acceptor 40 the decreased relative abundances of nitrosomonas and nitrospira in ac also demonstrate the presence of an anoxic environment in the immobilized carrier these results indicate that the difference in the do environment between the anammox immobilized carrier and the anammox granular sludge is the main reason for the varying structure of denitrifying bacteria in ag and ac therefore the ac sbr exhibited a better nitrogen removal performance than the ag sbr in the two stage pn a process in addition color is considered to be an intuitive and important indicator reflecting the activity of anammox granular sludge 41 for ag most of the red granules and a small part of dark brown granules transitioned to black granules after municipal wastewater treatment fig 7c and d red anammox granular sludge is generally considered to have a higher abundance of anammox bacteria while black sludge is considered to have a higher abundance of heterotrophic bacteria therefore the color change of ag is consistent with its microbial structure change 3 4 characteristics of the mainstream pn a process by gel immobilization stable pn and maintenance of anammox bacterial activity are crucial to the stability of the pn a process treating municipal wastewater in this study the pn immobilized carrier achieved stable pn and provided suitable influent conditions for the anammox reactor furthermore the pn reactor could degrade organic matter in the municipal wastewater which can effectively reduce the adverse effects of organic matter on the anammox system compared with the anammox granular sludge higher anammox bacterial activity and tnr was achieved by using anammox granular sludge as an immobilized carrier in the pn a system this is due to the use of an immobilization technology to effectively reduce the adverse effects caused by do and organic matter in the effluent of the pn reactor on the anammox system results show that 83 4 1 5 of the tn was removed by this two stage immobilized carrier pn a system resulting in good effluent quality the pn a process by gel immobilization has two advantages in practical engineering applications the first is that the immobilized carrier has good settling performance so it only needs a single reactor without a sedimentation tank the second due to the high abundance of functional bacteria in the immobilized carrier is that it can effectively improve the treatment capacity of wastewater treatment plants future research should explore the structural stability of the immobilized carriers for long term operation and the stability of the two stage immobilized carrier pn a system under actual mainstream conditions which exhibits fluctuating water flow low temperature and other varying conditions 4 conclusions a novel two stage pn a system employing gel immobilization was developed to treat municipal wastewater the resulting tn removal efficiency reached 83 4 1 5 and the nitrogen concentration in effluent met local water quality discharge standards stable pn with a high nar of 90 7 95 1 and a cod removal rate of 33 2 2 9 provided suitable influent conditions for the anammox reactor the ac sbr exhibited better a nitrogen removal performance than the ag sbr during the pn a process the immobilized carrier can effectively reduce the adverse effects of do and organic matter from the pn reactor effluent on anammox system which were the main factors affecting the denitrification pathways of the ag sbr and ac sbr the pn immobilized carrier can effectively reduce the growth of nob while maintaining the dominance of aob and the anammox immobilized carrier maintained the dominance of the functional bacteria candidatus kuenenia this study confirms the feasibility of using gel immobilization to achieve advanced

12766,nanofiltration nf has been increasingly used in drinking water treatment plants however the severe membrane fouling caused by organic matter poses great challenges to the application of nf technology this study investigated the mitigation of nf membrane fouling by different chemical cleaning reagents e g citric acid naoh na4 edta and na sds na4 edta and na sds performed better to achieve nf permeability recovery of up to 90 5 94 2 just in a single chemical cleaning cycle the hydraulic irreversible membrane fouling could be reduced by 44 9 53 8 in the multi cycle operation of chemical cleaning na4 edta based cleaning was beneficial to the removal performance of sulfamethazine sm2 and conferred higher removal efficiency than na sds based cleaning efficiency the impact of chemical cleaning on energy consumption was evaluated and indicated that na4 edta based cleaning could reduce the proportion of unfavorable energy consumption by 4 54 the operation stability of the nf process could be effectively improved by chemical cleaning and the organic pollutants accumulated on the membrane surface can be removed especially the chemical cleaning using na4 edta and na sds these findings could improve the operational efficiency of the nf process with low energy consumption low chemical consumption and less adverse environmental impact graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords nanofiltration membrane fouling chemical cleaning operation stability data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction nf process has been widely used in the field of municipal water supply in recent years owing to its effectiveness in the removals of toxic and harmful substances in the water while simultaneously retaining the mineral elements that are beneficial to human health 1 the effective pore size range of nf membrane is less than 1 nm and the molecular weight cut off is less than 400 da so the steric hindrance effect is more significant than that of the uf membrane which can remove almost all particles suspended solids colloids and microorganisms through steric hindrance 2 3 however previous studies have found that the fouling of nf membrane was rather severe in the treatment of surface water which brought great challenges to the practical application of nf membrane 4 5 the membrane fouling of nf process in treating the surface water was mainly caused by the organics foulants organic substances such as humus and proteins rich in surface water would accumulate on the nf membrane surface and deposit in the membrane pores resulting in severe membrane fouling and flux reduction 6 7 unlike ultrafiltration uf membrane nf would not adopt the operation of a high frequency backwashing process during its long term filtration and only chemical cleaning was performed under the condition of significant water production reduction or the transmembrane pressure increasing by more than 20 8 9 therefore the chemical cleaning of nf membranes played a fundamental role in the achievements of the steady operation of nf process 8 the chemical cleaning process could control the chemically recoverable membrane fouling in the nf process and positively affect the chemical and interface properties of the membrane surface and residual membrane fouling 10 12 however there are few reports on the chemical cleaning of nf process in surface water treatment 13 14 at present nf technology is mainly employed in the process of seawater desalination and the research on chemical cleaning in nf system primarily focused on the removal efficiency of various pollutants therefore it s full of significance and practice to systematically investigate the effects of chemical cleaning protocols on the operation stability and membrane fouling control of nf process in surface water treatments regarding nf membrane cleaning current research mainly focuses on chemical cleaning based on reagents 15 among them there are many studies on acidic reagents and alkaline reagents and the representative reagents are citric acid and naoh some scholars have also studied the cleaning effect of the alkaline chelating reagent na4 edta on the fouled nf membrane focusing on flux recovery and fouling alleviation 16 similar to uf process acids conferred an effective role in alleviating the inorganics caused membrane fouling of nf process and alkali exerted an excellent effect on the organics induced nf membrane fouling 17 18 in surface water treatment by nf process the specific membrane fouling caused by the inorganic and organic foulants occurred simultaneously 14 most organic pollutants in surface water were negatively charged and the introduction of chelating agents and surfactants can interact with organic contaminants in the water high ph conditions would benefit by making the natural organic matter nom induced fouling layer on the nf membrane surface looser more sparse and more susceptible to being diminished by the chemical cleaning program 19 mo et al evaluated the effects of different cleaning agents and cleaning frequencies on the alleviation of nf membrane fouling and suggested that the optimized protocol of nf process was to adopt acid based cleaning initially and followed by alkali based cleaning in deeply treating the effluent from the membrane bio reactor mbr system if the acid cleaning step was ignored before alkaline cleaning naoh could not contact organic pollutants 20 alexander simon et al estimated the effect of chemical cleaning under different temperature conditions on the physicochemical properties of nf membrane and its separation efficiency for inorganic salts which indicated that high temperature conditions would amplify or reduce the effects of chemical cleaning on the other membrane properties including hydrophobicity surface roughness and permeability 21 another study further demonstrated that the chemical cleaning method on line and off line cleaning and the change of transmembrane pressure also conferred different effects on the cleaning efficiency of nf membrane 22 at present research on chemical cleaning in nf process mainly focused on selecting some conventional chemical cleaning reagents and the changes in operating conditions 15 23 liikanen et al evaluated the cleaning efficiency and effect of various cleaning reagents such as citric acid hcl naoh na4 edta na2s2o4 on nf255 membrane its research focus was mainly on comparing cleaning efficiency in terms of flux recovery and fouling removal which provided a reference for the later research of nf membrane cleaning 23 li elimelech et al used atomic force microscopy afm to measure the condition of the membrane surface and between the bulk foulant and fouling layers carboxylate modified afm colloidal probes were used as a humic acid surrogate to investigate the mechanism of organic fouling and chemical cleaning the study on the interaction between chemical cleaning reagents and fouling layer provided a reference for the in depth exploration of chemical cleaning mechanism 24 but the mitigation mechanism of different types of chemical cleaning reagents on the membrane fouling of nf process was required to be further verified the cleaning mechanism of some special cleaning reagents based on na4 edta and na sds has not been deeply explored most current studies overlooked the long term performance evaluation of nf process after chemical cleaning the mechanism of membrane fouling development after chemical cleaning and the control effect of chemical cleaning on the irreversible membrane fouling required systematic investigation there was also a lack of mechanism evaluation and regulation principle about the influence of the chemical cleaning process on the membrane surface properties membrane fouling development and pollutant removal during surface water treatment by nf process therefore the objective of this study aimed at investigating the effect of four different reagents based chemical cleaning on the nf membrane fouling control including investigating the inhibitory effect and mechanism of the cleaning process on the development of nf membrane fouling under multi cycle and cross cycle conditions the nf membranes before and after chemical cleaning were characterized and the cleaning effects of four different chemical cleaning reagents were systematically investigated the concentration and migration law of sm2 accumulated in the filter cake layer on the membrane surface and exist in the filtered concentrated water were determined to further explore the mechanism of four different chemical cleaning agents for controlling membrane fouling the influence of the chemical cleaning reagents on the operation stability of nf technology was investigated by

is 42 cm2 the membrane was pressurized by pure water at 6 bar for 1 h to stabilize the water flux before the membrane test the cross flow velocity was controlled at 0 45 m s and the testing pressure was 5 bar nf270 membrane dupont nf270 usa was used as the experimental nf membrane the membrane properties obtained from the manufacturer are polyamide material with mwco of 200 400 da salt rejection of 97 maximum operating pressure of 41 bar and ph range of 2 11 due to the long filtration time of nf the pump would increase the water temperature during the pressurization process therefore a thermostatic bath was used to control the water temperature at 25 c 25 the pressure before the nf membrane was controlled to be 0 5 mpa by the high pressure pump the cross flow valve and the return valve the flow rate of cross flow filtration was 20 40 l h and this experiment adopted the filtration mode of constant production water volume the volume of raw water was 5 l and the water production data was recorded by the balance and computer the filtration process stopped when the water production reached the set requirement of 2 5 l the contaminated nf membrane was usually chemically cleaned the membrane surface was washed using permeate water during the start and stop of the operation the selection of chemical cleaning agents was optimized according to the recommendations of filmtec

groups of parallel filtering experiments were performed 2 3 analysis method 2 3 1 membrane resistance analysis nf membrane fouling was divided into reversible and irreversible fouling and the membrane resistance distribution was analyzed to characterize membrane fouling quantitatively the membrane resistance was divided into reversible and irreversible chemical cleaning resistance to evaluate the membrane fouling which can be diminished by chemical cleaning or not 27 the membrane resistance calculation method was derived from darcy s formula 1 j δp μ r where j is the membrane flux l m 2 h 1 δp is the transmembrane pressure pa μ is the viscosity coefficient of water pa s r is the membrane resistance m 1 according to the characteristics of membrane fouling control by the chemical cleanings concerning the reversibility or not the membrane resistance can be divided into the following three parts 2 r r m r cr r ir where r m is the self membrane resistance r cr is the chemically reversible membrane resistance r ir is the irreversible membrane resistance before the experiment pure water was filtered on the new membrane and the pure water flux was measured and brought into formula 1 to calculate its self membrane resistance after the filtration experiment was completed membrane fouling occurred changed the raw water to pure water measured the pure water flux of the membrane after fouling and calculated the total resistance r1 of the fouled membrane then the membrane was chemically cleaned the pure water flux of the membrane after cleaning was measured and the total resistance r2 of the membrane after cleaning was calculated the difference between the two results of r1 and r2 was the chemically reversible membrane resistance of nf and the result of subtracting the self membrane resistance from r2 was the irreversible membrane resistance 2 3 2 permeability removal efficiency analysis the calculations of nf membrane water permeability flux permeability recovery efficiency and removal efficiency were calculated by following equations respectively 3 j v ta 4 frr j w j 100 5 r 1 c p c f 100 where j is the membrane flux l m 2 h 1 t is the running time h a is the

concentration in membrane permeate and feed weed respectively 2 3 3 membrane characterization the surface morphologies of the intrinsic nf membrane and fouling layer formed on the membrane surface were characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem quanta 200 fei usa before the sem visualization the membrane sample was rinsed with pure water several times and then the membrane sample was cut into slices with a size of 0 5 cm 0 5 cm after drying at a temperature of 45 c for 24 h the samples were fixed on the observation table and the edge area was fixed with conductive glue the pretreated membrane samples were selected at different magnifications for observation furthermore the nf membrane surfaces in different states were characterized using an attenuated total reflection flourier transformed infrared spectroscopy atr ftir spectrum one b perkinelmer usa after drying the membrane samples at a low temperature 45 c for 24 h the surfaces of the nf membranes in different states were

mode with a scan range of 10 μm 10 μm the chemical composition of the nf270 was inspected with x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab250xi usa 2 3 4 methods for trace organics the trace organic compound sm2 was determined using high performance liquid chromatography 1200 agilent usa equipped with the liquid chromatography column of ods c18 column spherisorb ods2 column 5 μm 4 6 mm 250 mm

acetonitrile and 25 pure water the detection flow efficiency was 1 ml min and the injection volume was 100 μl 28 2 3 5 analysis of 3d fluorescence spectrum the excitation emission matrix eem spectra were generated through scanning with excitation wavelengths of 200 450 nm at an interval of 5 nm and emission wavelengths of 250 550 nm at an interval of 1 nm by using a fluorescence spectrometer f7000 hitachi japan the florescent characteristics of the foulants accumulated on the membrane surface before and after chemical cleaning were determined by a molecular fluorescence spectrometer the 3 d fluorescence spectrum reflected the result of the superposition of the fluorescent properties of various components in the experiment the parallel factor analysis parafac method was used to distinguish the response signal of the superimposed components of the fluorescent substances 29 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane permeability and recovery efficiency 3 1 1 single cycle chemical cleaning fig 2 shows the permeability and cleaning recovery efficiency of the nf membrane in treating the feed water based on the cleaning procedure using different reagents the nf membranes used were all new nf270 membranes of the same specification and the filtration mode was constant production water volume as shown in fig 2 serious membrane fouling occurred in the nf membrane the raw water permeability of nf decreased rapidly from the initial 8 3 9 1 lmh bar to 5 62 6 01 lmh bar and the specific flux decreased by more than 35 the permeability of nf process was recovered by chemical cleaning but the recovery effect was different with different cleaning chemicals after cleaning with acid citric acid alkali naoh chelating agent na4 edta and surfactant na sds the permeability recovery efficiency of the nf membrane were 74 6 84 1 90 5 and 94 2 respectively citric acid exerted the lowest cleaning efficiency in controlling the membrane fouling mainly because acid could alleviate the inorganics caused membrane fouling and conferred little effects on the organics induced membrane fouling 30 the content of inorganic salts in songhua river water was low and the proportion of inorganics induced membrane fouling was less than 10 31 therefore citric acid just exhibited a limited effect on relieving the nf membrane fouling the cleaning effect of naoh on membrane fouling performed better than that of citric acid mainly attributed to the higher solubility of nom in alkaline conditions 32 the two special cleaning reagents have a good cleaning effect on membrane fouling as a chelating agent na4 edta could not only combine with metal ions to alleviate the inorganic membrane fouling but also undergo a coordination reaction with carboxylate humic acid was rich in carboxyl so na4 edta could effectively react with humic acid and dissolve it to control the membrane fouling and recover the membrane permeability as an anionic surfactant na sds also had a strong cleaning effect on the alleviation of membrane fouling especially on the organics induced membrane fouling 33 interestingly the cleaning recovery efficiency of surfactants was the highest among the four chemical cleaning reagents furthermore it could also be implied that na4 edta and na sds both conferred excellent and similar effects on the membrane fouling control in the single cycle cleaning 3 1 2 multi cycle chemical cleaning based on the results of fig 2 it can be found that the suggested four reagents were beneficial to the membrane permeability recovery however none of them could fully restore the permeability of the nf process indicating that the residual membrane fouling was related to the irreversible membrane fouling therefore this section would examine the cleaning efficiency and the accumulation of irreversible membrane fouling during four chemical cleaning cycles as illustrated in fig 3 the membrane permeability gradually decreased with the increase of the nf operating cycle especially after the fourth cycle of filtration the membrane permeability of acid cleaning and alkali cleaning based nf process had dropped to a rather low level 5 87 lmh bar and 6 75 lmh bar obviously more melancholy than the scenarios of na4 edta and na sds 7 4 lmh bar and 7 07 lmh bar it was worth noting that in the third and fourth cycles the decline and recovery of the nf membrane permeability after na4 edta and na sds cleaning were different from the previous two cycles in addition the chemical cleaning effect of na4 edta on the membrane permeability was better than that in the case of na sds involved cleaning process to further observe the effect of chemical cleaning reagents on membrane fouling under long term operation the accumulation of irreversible membrane fouling after chemical cleaning in the four cycle process was calculated the results are shown in fig 4 combining figs 3 and 4 it can be found that irreversible fouling of the nf membrane continued to accumulate as the filtration cycle progressed the chemical cleaning process was difficult to completely control the occurrence of such irreversible fouling which was also the main reason for the decline of the life of nf membranes 34 however the effects of the four chemical cleaning reagents on irreversible fouling were different citric acid was less effective and irreversible fouling continuously grew the fastest reaching the highest filtration resistance of 7 97 1012 m 1 in the first filtration cycle the increased efficiency in the subsequent three cycles gradually decreased and the irreversible fouling reached 14 23 1012 m 1 after four cycle filtration the permeability of the fourth cycle was only 68 2 of the first cycle and the irreversible pollution appeared serious in the first cycle after na4 edta cleaning the irreversible membrane fouling increased less only 2 9 1012 m 1 the growth efficiency of irreversible fouling in each of the following three cycles was slow and the increment gradually decreased after the final fourth chemical cleaning cycle the irreversible fouling only increased to 6 58 1012 m 1 and the permeability recovery efficiency remained at approximately 82 the development of membrane fouling in naoh based cleaning scenario was close to that of na4 edta but the effect was not as good as that of na4 edta the membrane resistance of naoh based nf process was significantly higher than that of na4 edta in every cycle na sds conferred the best cleaning effect in the first cycle and the irreversible membrane fouling was the lowest approximately just 1 78 1012 m 1 but na sds based cleaning procedure was different from other cleaning reagents in that the increment of irreversible membrane fouling in the fourth cycle was larger than that in the second and third cycles which resulted in the accumulation of irreversible membrane fouling after four cycles being higher than that of na4 edta reaching approximately 7 84 1012 m 1 such results should be related to that some monomers of the surfactant in the repeated cleaning process were adsorbed on the membrane surface thereby increasing the membrane filtration resistance 35 another nf study has also reported such a phenomenon 21 a similar phenomenon was found to be more pronounced for cationic surfactants since the surface of the nf membranes was predominantly negatively charged therefore for the nf membrane fouling caused by the organic foulants na sds was optimized as the best chemical cleaning with the highest membrane permeability recovery in terms of irreversible membrane fouling control although na sds performed better in a single cleaning the little difference was observed from that of na4 edta during long term operation due to the adsorption of the surfactant reagent monomer 3 2 removal efficiency and migration law of sm2 sm2 was selected as a typical trace organic compound to investigate the contribution of nf to the removal of trace organics and the stability of nf to the removal of trace organics under chemical cleaning conditions the molecular weight of sm2 was 300 da and the effect of nf270 on the removal of sm2 during chemical cleaning was more clearly evaluated fig 5 displays the variety in the removal efficiency of sm2 compared to the new nf membrane with sm2 removal efficiency of 64 6 it was found that the decrease of sm2 removal efficiency was positively correlated with the degree of membrane fouling with the aggravation of membrane fouling the removal effect of sm2 became worse so its removal rate decreased more seriously after chemical cleaning the reduction of the removal efficiency could be alleviated to a certain extent but none of them could be beneficial to the removal of trace organics or completely alleviate the problem of the removal efficiency reduction previous studies indicated that the membrane fouling was not conducive to the removal of trace organic compounds by the nf process 36 the potential explanation was related to that the fouling caused by calcium ion adsorption on the membrane surface would weaken the electrostatic repulsion effect resulting in the fouling layer absorbing the trace organics and causing the membrane surface concentration to increase at the same time the change in hydrophilic hydrophobic interaction and concentration polarization would also be changed accordingly specifically the mitigation effect of citric acid on the attenuation of the sm2 removal efficiency was limited but when the filtration time was 3 h the removal efficiency of sm2 after chemical cleaning decreased by 1 2 compared with that before cleaning interestingly although it has been proved in the previous section that na4 edta and na sds were both effective and little difference was found in controlling the nf fouling obvious differences between the two cleaning agents in the removal of trace organics were observed na4 edta conferred higher capability in alleviating the decrease of sm2 removal efficiency than na sds in the most fouled group membrane fouling caused a 9 2 drop in the removal efficiency of sm2 compared with the clean membrane the removal efficiency of sm2 just decreased by 5 7 after cleaning with na sds while the removal efficiency of sm2 decreased by only 1 9 after cleaning with na4 edta the above phenomenon also had similar results in other groups fig 6 showed the material balance analysis of sm2 in the system when the nf membrane intercepted sm2 under different conditions the mass distribution ratio of sm2 in the system when sm2 was retained by nf membrane under different conditions was analyzed due to the adsorption of the cake layer attached on the membrane surface the fouled nf membrane would significantly increase the accumulation of sm2 on the membrane surface 37 38 however after comparing na4 edta and na sds cleaning it was found that chelating reagents and surfactants could alleviate organics induced membrane fouling and reduce the deposition of trace organics after chemical cleaning although the percentage of residual sm2 on the membrane surface decreased there was no significant difference between the two special chemical cleaners however from the variety of the removal efficiency of sm2 in fig 6 it could be inferred that the migration of trace organics in the membrane system should not be the main factor affecting the improvement of the membrane retention effect of the chemical cleaning reagents 3 3 membrane characterization after chemical cleaning 3 3 1 analysis of functional group properties the ati ftir spectra of the nf membranes cleaned with different reagents are shown in fig 7 it could be seen that the intrinsic nf270 membrane without any fouling showed the typical characteristic peaks of the polyamide functional and support layer it could be seen that 1488 cm 1 1504 cm 1 and 1580 cm 1 were the stretching vibration peaks in the phenyl ring these characteristic peaks were superimposed on characteristic peaks of the polyamide layer and polysulfone layer 39 such results elucidated that the thickness of the polyamide functional layer on the surface of nf270 was small so the characteristic peaks of the polysulfone support layer were detected by infrared rays the spectrum of fouled nf delivered absorption peaks at 3400 cm 1 1630 cm 1 and 1420 cm 1 which was consistent with the characteristic that the main nom in songhua river water was humus 40 at the same time the main characteristic peaks of the nf membrane were weakened after chemical cleaning the characteristic peaks of the nf270 support layer were observed again the red circle in fig 7 41 the recovery efficiencies of the characteristic peaks after chemical cleaning with different reagents were different which were mainly reflected in the highest recovery intensity of naoh na4 edta and na sds indicating that such three chemical reagents conferred the best removal effect on organic foulants especially after edta cleaning the characteristic peaks of the nf270 support layer basically recovered and were similar to that of the new membrane comparing the cleaning effects of the four reagents it could be found that the characteristic peaks of humic substances were weakened indicating that the chemical cleaning mainly contributed to the removals of nom contaminants from the spectral point of view limited differences in the effects of the four cleaning processes were observed from the recovery results of the penetration performance in section 3 1 3 3 2 morphology observation of membrane surface by sem fig 8 is the sem images of nf membranes with or without chemical cleaning a rough fouling layer was found on the surface of the fouled nf membrane without any cleaning reagents different from low pressure membranes such as uf nf membranes rarely blocked the membrane pores and the formation of cake layer caused by small molecular organic substances was the main cause of the membrane fouling after chemical cleaning the foulants accumulated on the membrane surface were reduced in the acid based cleaning part of the foulants still left on the membrane surface and the cake layer could also be obviously visualized compared with the membrane before cleaning the cake layer was reduced but it was denser and had a gel like shape the membrane surface was rather clean and smooth after cleaning using the na4 edta and na sds indicating that the cleaning process could effectively remove the fouling layer adhering to the surface of the nf membrane 3 3 3 quantification of membrane surface roughness by afm the images of the nf membrane surface captured by the afm under different chemical cleaning conditions are shown in fig 9 and the roughness of the membrane surface was also quantified in this study no significant scaling problem was observed since the feed water of nf process was pretreated by the bank filter consequently the increased roughness of the fouled membrane surface originated from the formation of organics induced cake layer attached on the membrane surface the roughness of the cake layer would affect the hydraulic conditions during nf operation which resulted in a reduction of the effective pressure at the same time the rough membrane surface was more liable to cause the accumulation of foulants especially organic pollutants further facilitating the membrane fouling it could be seen that the roughness of the fouled membrane surface was 260 nm and the chemical cleaning could effectively restore the smoothness of the membrane surface by removing the organic matter on the membrane surface to reduce its roughness in the case of acid based chemical cleaning the roughness foulant membrane surface was reduced to 177 nm and further reduced to 125 nm in the scenario of alkaline based cleaning the effect of na4 edta and na sds was good and consistent with the results of flux recovery and the membrane surface roughness was the lowest after cleaning compared to the fouled membrane the roughness of nf membrane surface after cleaning with na4 edta and na sds was decreased to 97 nm and 82 nm respectively which also proved the cleaning effect from the membrane surface morphology 21 3 3 4 molecular fluorescence spectrometer the nf membranes before and after chemical cleaning were characterized by solid phase eem since the nf270 used in this experiment was mainly made of polyamide a strong response was observed in fe eem under solid phase conditions centered in the region of ex em 205 354 nm the clean nf membrane mainly showed the self response of polyamide but such response was attenuated with membrane fouling occurring 33 39 42 this was mainly because the nom dominated fouling layer covered the membrane surface when treating songhua river water under solid phase conditions nom had no obvious florescent response due to the presence of highly absorbing colored groups so that it would shelter the response of polyamide in solid phase eem in the present experiment the difference of the eem of the membrane surface between fouled and after chemical cleaning was used to evaluate the chemical cleaning effect by the characteristic response change of the polyamide area as shown in fig 10 it could be seen that the polyamide self response after chemical cleaning was recovered compared with citric acid cleaning the two special chemical cleaning reagents na4 edta and na sds could remove more contaminants and make the filter cake layer thinner to significantly improve the response of the polyamide 43 3 3 5 element distribution changes on the membrane surface the fouled and cleaned nf membranes were tested by xps to analyze the amount of calcium ions deposited on the membrane surface table 1 shows the xps spectrum and element content analysis of nf membranes under different conditions the o n ratio of the clean nf membrane was 2 which was in line with the o n ratio range of the polyamide membrane 44 45 however with the increase of organic pollutants accumulated on the membrane surface all kinds of natural organic matter had become the main characteristic substances this resulted in an increase in the o content and a decrease in the s content at the same time the calcium content of the fouled membrane increased the potential explanation was that some of the calcium ions were attracted by the negatively charged nf membrane surface the other part of the calcium ions had a bridging effect with natural organics e g humus and calcium ions have existed on the membrane surface during the formation of the filter cake layer in comparison with the elemental changes on the membrane surface after chemical cleaning it could be seen that the c o ratio of the nf membrane after acid cleaning was basically the same as that before cleaning which indicated that the effect of the acid cleaning on the organic fouling control was ineffective on the other hand the proportion of calcium ions after acid cleaning was higher than that of fouled membranes this may be due to the poor cleaning effect of acid cleaning on organic pollution and the strong complex formed by organic pollution and calcium ions was not well removed it could also be seen from the sem image that the nf membrane surface was dense and in gel like shape after acid cleaning which promoted the aggregation of calcium ions on the membrane surface in the scenarios of the two special reagents na4 edta and na sds the c o ratio of the membrane surface changed significantly indicating that the cleaning process efficiently removed the organic matter accumulated on the membrane surface however the proportion of calcium on the membrane surface was different after cleaning with such two reagents the calcium concentration after na sds cleaning was the highest reaching 1 18 this was mainly because the cleaning process of the two reagents was under alkaline conditions which was not conducive to releasing calcium ions due to the electrostatic adsorption by the membrane surface on the other hand the active reagent monomer remained on the membrane surface after cleaning 46 these residual active agents increased the negative charge on the membrane surface which was also not conducive to removing calcium ions 21 as a consequence the calcium ions on the membrane surface increased after na sds cleaning but after na4 edta cleaning the calcium ions content decreased significantly as a chelating agent na4 edta would form a strong complex with calcium ions due to coordination therefore nom molecules interacting with calcium ions were replaced by edta through a ligand exchange reaction making the foulants easier to be washed off from the membrane surface 47 at the same time the calcium ions between the filter cake layer were also taken away as a result the proportion of calcium on the surface of the membrane after cleaning was only 0 64 3 4 energy consumption analysis chemical cleaning would not only affect the membrane surface properties but also influence the development of membrane fouling in the next cycle for the entire filtration cycle whether these effects had an impact on the energy consumption of the cycle operation was the point we focused on in this study therefore we investigated the variation in energy consumption of the complete cycle filtration process after chemical cleaning and the results are shown in fig 11 it could be found that for the new nf270 the proportion of other energy was only 3 64 this part of the energy consumption was mainly related to the flow channel of the nf small test component after multiple cycles of fouling and cleaning the proportion of the other energy increased significantly in the case with low cleaning efficiency among them the proportion of other energy in citric acid based cleaning reached 13 35 48 compared with the energy consumption of na sds and acid based cleaning na4 edta performed much better and could further reduce other energy consumption by 2 47 and 4 54 respectively under the premise of merely calculating the membrane surface s energy consumption without considering the pump s conversion efficiency and other factors the membrane fouling caused an extra energy consumption of 0 288 kwh which was a huge energy cost however we could reduce energy consumption by removing or alleviating membrane fouling with an effective chemical cleaning method 49 for example na4 edta cleaning could reduce energy consumption by 4 54 compared to the case using acid cleaning the unfavorable power consumption per ton of water was reduced to 0 220 kwh the electricity consumption per ton of water was saved by 0 068 kwh energy consumption could be reduced through the chemical cleaning process which effectively improved the operational stability of nf process 3 5 mechanisms of na4 edta and na sds based cleaning the above results showed that the fouled nf membrane exerted a rough filter cake layer 50 52 unlike uf membranes although nf also has pollutants that block membrane pores in the songhua river water treatment process the filter cake layer fouling caused by small molecular organics is the main membrane fouling 33 52 na4 edta and na sds involved chemical cleaning conferred more excellent permeability recovery and the possible mechanism is illustrated in fig 12 as a chelating reagent na4 edta can coordinate with calcium ions to form strong complexes and nom molecules interacting with calcium ions would be replaced by the edta through ligand exchange reaction 53 the stability of the cake layer was destroyed making contaminants accumulated on the nf membrane surface easier to be washed away 23 33 at the same time the calcium ions deposited within the cake layers were also washed away during the chemical cleaning process resulting in a significant reduction in the proportion of calcium ions on the membrane surface after cleaning 20 the roughness of the film surface was reduced and the film surface under sem was clean as a surfactant na sds mainly relied on the hydrophobic end of the active agent to adhere to organic matters and dissolve the organic fouling layer 24 33 54 at the same time the bridge effect formed by calcium ions and organic matters was decomposed and part of the calcium ions was released and washed away under alkaline conditions the membrane was negatively charged and the hydrophobic end of na sds would be close to the membrane interface 50 55 the active monomers remaining on the membrane surface can increase the negative charge of the membrane surface 16 which was not conducive to the removal of calcium ions thus the calcium ions on the membrane surface would increase after na sds cleaning both sds and edta based chemical cleaning reduced the roughness of the membrane surface from the characterization of afm after cleaning 4 conclusion in this study the chemical cleaning efficiency and membrane fouling control of the nf process using four typical chemical cleaning reagents were evaluated the main conclusions were as follows 1 na sds based cleaning had the highest cleaning efficiency and the permeability could be recovered by 94 2 in the single cycle operation in terms of irreversible fouling control na4 edta based cleaning had the best performance and the irreversible resistance was only 6 58 1012 m 1 after four cycles which was better than that of na sds 2 na4 edta based cleaning performed better in mitigating the decrease of sm2 removal efficiency compared to the scenario of na sds but a limited difference was observed in the transfer results of sm2 between the two former reagents the migration of trace organics was not the main factor for the two reagents i e na4 edta and na sds to influence the membrane rejection 3 as a chelating reagent na4 edta could coordinate with calcium ions to form strong complexes and nom molecules interacting with calcium ions would be replaced by the edta through ligand exchange reaction edta could destabilize the filter cake layer making it easier for contaminants accumulated on the nf membrane surface to be washed away 4 na sds mainly relied on the hydrophobic end of the active agent to adsorb organic matter the bridging effect formed by calcium ions and organic matter was decomposed the organic fouling layer was dissolved and part of the calcium ions was released and washed away however after repeated chemical cleaning the active monomers would remain on the membrane surface which would increase the negative charge on the membrane surface during the long term operation na sds was not conducive to the removal of calcium ions 5 in terms of energy consumption control the effect of na4 edta was better than na sds compared with other reagents na4 edta based cleaning reduced other energy consumption by 4 54 energy consumption could be reduced and the operation stability of nf treatment could be effectively improved by

12766,nanofiltration nf has been increasingly used in drinking water treatment plants however the severe membrane fouling caused by organic matter poses great challenges to the application of nf technology this study investigated the mitigation of nf membrane fouling by different chemical cleaning reagents e g citric acid naoh na4 edta and na sds na4 edta and na sds performed better to achieve nf permeability recovery of up to 90 5 94 2 just in a single chemical cleaning cycle the hydraulic irreversible membrane fouling could be reduced by 44 9 53 8 in the multi cycle operation of chemical cleaning na4 edta based cleaning was beneficial to the removal performance of sulfamethazine sm2 and conferred higher removal efficiency than na sds based cleaning efficiency the impact of chemical cleaning on energy consumption was evaluated and indicated that na4 edta based cleaning could reduce the proportion of unfavorable energy consumption by 4 54 the operation stability of the nf process could be effectively improved by chemical cleaning and the organic pollutants accumulated on the membrane surface can be removed especially the chemical cleaning using na4 edta and na sds these findings could improve the operational efficiency of the nf process with low energy consumption low chemical consumption and less adverse environmental impact graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords nanofiltration membrane fouling chemical cleaning operation stability data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction nf process has been widely used in the field of municipal water supply in recent years owing to its effectiveness in the removals of toxic and harmful substances in the water while simultaneously retaining the mineral elements that are beneficial to human health 1 the effective pore size range of nf membrane is less than 1 nm and the molecular weight cut off is less than 400 da so the steric hindrance effect is more significant than that of the uf membrane which can remove almost all particles suspended solids colloids and microorganisms through steric hindrance 2 3 however previous studies have found that the fouling of nf membrane was rather severe in the treatment of surface water which brought great challenges to the practical application of nf membrane 4 5 the membrane fouling of nf process in treating the surface water was mainly caused by the organics foulants organic substances such as humus and proteins rich in surface water would accumulate on the nf membrane surface and deposit in the membrane pores resulting in severe membrane fouling and flux reduction 6 7 unlike ultrafiltration uf membrane nf would not adopt the operation of a high frequency backwashing process during its long term filtration and only chemical cleaning was performed under the condition of significant water production reduction or the transmembrane pressure increasing by more than 20 8 9 therefore the chemical cleaning of nf membranes played a fundamental role in the achievements of the steady operation of nf process 8 the chemical cleaning process could control the chemically recoverable membrane fouling in the nf process and positively affect the chemical and interface properties of the membrane surface and residual membrane fouling 10 12 however there are few reports on the chemical cleaning of nf process in surface water treatment 13 14 at present nf technology is mainly employed in the process of seawater desalination and the research on chemical cleaning in nf system primarily focused on the removal efficiency of various pollutants therefore it s full of significance and practice to systematically investigate the effects of chemical cleaning protocols on the operation stability and membrane fouling control of nf process in surface water treatments regarding nf membrane cleaning current research mainly focuses on chemical cleaning based on reagents 15 among them there are many studies on acidic reagents and alkaline reagents and the representative reagents are citric acid and naoh some scholars have also studied the cleaning effect of the alkaline chelating reagent na4 edta on the fouled nf membrane focusing on flux recovery and fouling alleviation 16 similar to uf process acids conferred an effective role in alleviating the inorganics caused membrane fouling of nf process and alkali exerted an excellent effect on the organics induced nf membrane fouling 17 18 in surface water treatment by nf process the specific membrane fouling caused by the inorganic and organic foulants occurred simultaneously 14 most organic pollutants in surface water were negatively charged and the introduction of chelating agents and surfactants can interact with organic contaminants in the water high ph conditions would benefit by making the natural organic matter nom induced fouling layer on the nf membrane surface looser more sparse and more susceptible to being diminished by the chemical cleaning program 19 mo et al evaluated the effects of different cleaning agents and cleaning frequencies on the alleviation of nf membrane fouling and suggested that the optimized protocol of nf process was to adopt acid based cleaning initially and followed by alkali based cleaning in deeply treating the effluent from the membrane bio reactor mbr system if the acid cleaning step was ignored before alkaline cleaning naoh could not contact organic pollutants 20 alexander simon et al estimated the effect of chemical cleaning under different temperature conditions on the physicochemical properties of nf membrane and its separation efficiency for inorganic salts which indicated that high temperature conditions would amplify or reduce the effects of chemical cleaning on the other membrane properties including hydrophobicity surface roughness and permeability 21 another study further demonstrated that the chemical cleaning method on line and off line cleaning and the change of transmembrane pressure also conferred different effects on the cleaning efficiency of nf membrane 22 at present research on chemical cleaning in nf process mainly focused on selecting some conventional chemical cleaning reagents and the changes in operating conditions 15 23 liikanen et al evaluated the cleaning efficiency and effect of various cleaning reagents such as citric acid hcl naoh na4 edta na2s2o4 on nf255 membrane its research focus was mainly on comparing cleaning efficiency in terms of flux recovery and fouling removal which provided a reference for the later research of nf membrane cleaning 23 li elimelech et al used atomic force microscopy afm to measure the condition of the membrane surface and between the bulk foulant and fouling layers carboxylate modified afm colloidal probes were used as a humic acid surrogate to investigate the mechanism of organic fouling and chemical cleaning the study on the interaction between chemical cleaning reagents and fouling layer provided a reference for the in depth exploration of chemical cleaning mechanism 24 but the mitigation mechanism of different types of chemical cleaning reagents on the membrane fouling of nf process was required to be further verified the cleaning mechanism of some special cleaning reagents based on na4 edta and na sds has not been deeply explored most current studies overlooked the long term performance evaluation of nf process after chemical cleaning the mechanism of membrane fouling development after chemical cleaning and the control effect of chemical cleaning on the irreversible membrane fouling required systematic investigation there was also a lack of mechanism evaluation and regulation principle about the influence of the chemical cleaning process on the membrane surface properties membrane fouling development and pollutant removal during surface water treatment by nf process therefore the objective of this study aimed at investigating the effect of four different reagents based chemical cleaning on the nf membrane fouling control including investigating the inhibitory effect and mechanism of the cleaning process on the development of nf membrane fouling under multi cycle and cross cycle conditions the nf membranes before and after chemical cleaning were characterized and the cleaning effects of four different chemical cleaning reagents were systematically investigated the concentration and migration law of sm2 accumulated in the filter cake layer on the membrane surface and exist in the filtered concentrated water were determined to further explore the mechanism of four different chemical cleaning agents for controlling membrane fouling the influence of the chemical cleaning reagents on the operation stability of nf technology was investigated by studying the changes of chemical cleaning reagents on nf membrane filtration retention performance and operating energy consumption 2 experimental materials and methods 2 1 experimental water and

316 φ10 mm china electronic balances stx1202zh ohaus usa and computers the details can be found in fig 1 the cross flow membrane cell filtration equipment with an effective area of each membrane cell is 42 cm2 the membrane was pressurized by pure water at 6 bar for 1 h to stabilize the water flux before the membrane test the cross flow velocity was controlled at 0 45 m s and the testing pressure was 5 bar nf270 membrane dupont nf270 usa was used as the experimental nf membrane the membrane properties obtained from the manufacturer are polyamide material with mwco of 200 400 da salt rejection of 97 maximum operating pressure of 41 bar and ph range of 2 11 due to the long filtration time of nf the pump would increase the water temperature during the pressurization process therefore a thermostatic bath was used to control the water temperature at 25 c 25 the pressure before the nf membrane was controlled to be 0 5 mpa by the high pressure pump the cross flow valve and the return valve the flow rate of cross flow filtration was 20 40 l h and this experiment adopted the filtration mode of constant production water volume the volume of raw water was 5 l and the water production data was recorded by the balance and computer the filtration process stopped when the water production reached the set requirement of 2 5 l the contaminated nf membrane was usually chemically cleaned the membrane surface was washed using permeate water during the start and stop of the operation the selection of chemical cleaning agents was optimized according to the recommendations of filmtec

groups of parallel filtering experiments were performed 2 3 analysis method 2 3 1 membrane resistance analysis nf membrane fouling was divided into reversible and irreversible fouling and the membrane resistance distribution was analyzed to characterize membrane fouling quantitatively the membrane resistance was divided into reversible and irreversible chemical cleaning resistance to evaluate the membrane fouling which can be diminished by chemical cleaning or not 27 the membrane resistance calculation method was derived from darcy s formula 1 j δp μ r where j is the membrane flux l m 2 h 1 δp is the transmembrane pressure pa μ is the viscosity coefficient of water pa s r is the membrane resistance m 1 according to the characteristics of membrane fouling control by the chemical cleanings concerning the reversibility or not the membrane resistance can be divided into the following three parts 2 r r m r cr r ir where r m is the self membrane resistance r cr is the chemically reversible membrane resistance r ir is the irreversible membrane resistance before the experiment pure water was filtered on the new membrane and the pure water flux was measured and brought into formula 1 to calculate its self membrane resistance after the filtration experiment was completed membrane fouling occurred changed the raw water to pure water measured the pure water flux of the membrane after fouling and calculated the total resistance r1 of the fouled membrane then the membrane was chemically cleaned the pure water flux of the membrane after cleaning was measured and the total resistance r2 of the membrane after cleaning was calculated the difference between the two results of r1 and r2 was the chemically reversible membrane resistance of nf and the result of subtracting the self membrane resistance from r2 was the irreversible membrane resistance 2 3 2 permeability removal efficiency analysis the calculations of nf membrane water permeability flux permeability recovery efficiency and removal efficiency were calculated by following equations respectively 3 j v ta 4 frr j w j 100 5 r 1 c p c f 100 where j is the membrane flux l m 2 h 1 t is the running time h a is the

concentration in membrane permeate and feed weed respectively 2 3 3 membrane characterization the surface morphologies of the intrinsic nf membrane and fouling layer formed on the membrane surface were characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem quanta 200 fei usa before the sem visualization the membrane sample was rinsed with pure water several times and then the membrane sample was cut into slices with a size of 0 5 cm 0 5 cm after drying at a temperature of 45 c for 24 h the samples were fixed on the observation table and the edge area was fixed with conductive glue the pretreated membrane samples were selected at different magnifications for observation furthermore the nf membrane surfaces in different states were characterized using an attenuated total reflection flourier transformed infrared spectroscopy atr ftir spectrum one b perkinelmer usa after drying the membrane samples at a low temperature 45 c for 24 h the surfaces of the nf membranes in different states were detected and characterized the surface morphology and roughness of nf membranes and pollutants in different states were characterized by atomic force microscopy afm bioscope veeco usa afm uses tapping mode with a scan range of 10 μm 10 μm the chemical composition of the nf270 was inspected with x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab250xi usa 2 3 4 methods for trace organics the trace organic compound sm2 was determined using high performance liquid chromatography 1200 agilent usa equipped with the liquid chromatography column of ods c18 column spherisorb ods2 column 5 μm 4 6 mm 250 mm waters usa the detector was an ultraviolet detector with a characteristic detection wavelength of 270 nm acetonitrile and pure water were adopted in the mobile phases at a mobile phase ratio of 75 acetonitrile and 25 pure water the detection flow efficiency was 1 ml min and the injection volume was 100 μl 28 2 3 5 analysis of 3d fluorescence spectrum the excitation emission matrix eem spectra were generated through scanning with excitation wavelengths of 200 450 nm at an interval of 5 nm and emission wavelengths of 250 550 nm at an interval of 1 nm by using a fluorescence spectrometer f7000 hitachi japan the florescent characteristics of the foulants accumulated on the membrane surface before and after chemical cleaning were determined by a molecular fluorescence spectrometer the 3 d fluorescence spectrum reflected the result of the superposition of the fluorescent properties of various components in the experiment the parallel factor analysis parafac method was used to distinguish the response signal of the superimposed components of the fluorescent substances 29 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane permeability and recovery efficiency 3 1 1 single cycle chemical cleaning fig 2 shows the permeability and cleaning recovery efficiency of the nf membrane in treating the feed water based on the cleaning procedure using different reagents the nf membranes used were all new nf270 membranes of the same specification and the filtration mode was constant production water volume as shown in fig 2 serious membrane fouling occurred in the nf membrane the raw water permeability of nf decreased rapidly from the initial 8 3 9 1 lmh bar to 5 62 6 01 lmh bar and the specific flux decreased by more than 35 the permeability of nf process was recovered by chemical cleaning but the recovery effect was different with different cleaning chemicals after cleaning with acid citric acid alkali naoh chelating agent na4 edta and surfactant na sds the permeability recovery efficiency of the nf membrane were 74 6 84 1 90 5 and 94 2 respectively citric acid exerted the lowest cleaning efficiency in controlling the membrane fouling mainly because acid could alleviate the inorganics caused membrane fouling and conferred little effects on the organics induced membrane fouling 30 the content of inorganic salts in songhua river water was low and the proportion of inorganics induced membrane fouling was less than 10 31 therefore citric acid just exhibited a limited effect on relieving the nf membrane fouling the cleaning effect of naoh on membrane fouling performed better than that of citric acid mainly attributed to the higher solubility of nom in alkaline conditions 32 the two special cleaning reagents have a good cleaning effect on membrane fouling as a chelating agent na4 edta could not only combine with metal ions to alleviate the inorganic membrane fouling but also undergo a coordination reaction with carboxylate humic acid was rich in carboxyl so na4 edta could effectively react with humic acid and dissolve it to control the membrane fouling and recover the membrane permeability as an anionic surfactant na sds also had a strong cleaning effect on the alleviation of membrane fouling especially on the organics induced membrane fouling 33 interestingly the cleaning recovery efficiency of surfactants was the highest among the four chemical cleaning reagents furthermore it could also be implied that na4 edta and na sds both conferred excellent and similar effects on the membrane fouling control in the single cycle cleaning 3 1 2 multi cycle chemical cleaning based on the results of fig 2 it can be found that the suggested four reagents were beneficial to the membrane permeability recovery however none of them could fully restore the permeability of the nf process indicating that the residual membrane fouling was related to the irreversible membrane fouling therefore this section would examine the cleaning efficiency and the accumulation of irreversible membrane fouling during four chemical cleaning cycles as illustrated in fig 3 the membrane permeability gradually decreased with the increase of the nf operating cycle especially after the fourth cycle of filtration the membrane permeability of acid cleaning and alkali cleaning based nf process had dropped to a rather low level 5 87 lmh bar and 6 75 lmh bar obviously more melancholy than the scenarios of na4 edta and na sds 7 4 lmh bar and 7 07 lmh bar it was worth noting that in the third and fourth cycles the decline and recovery of the nf membrane permeability after na4 edta and na sds cleaning were different from the previous two cycles in addition the chemical cleaning effect of na4 edta on the membrane permeability was better than that in the case of na sds involved cleaning process to further observe the effect of chemical cleaning reagents on membrane fouling under long term operation the accumulation of irreversible membrane fouling after chemical cleaning in the four cycle process was calculated the results are shown in fig 4 combining figs 3 and 4 it can be found that irreversible fouling of the nf membrane continued to accumulate as the filtration cycle progressed the chemical cleaning process was difficult to completely control the occurrence of such irreversible fouling which was also the main reason for the decline of the life of nf membranes 34 however the effects of the four chemical cleaning reagents on irreversible fouling were different citric acid was less effective and irreversible fouling continuously grew the fastest reaching the highest filtration resistance of 7 97 1012 m 1 in the first filtration cycle the increased efficiency in the subsequent three cycles gradually decreased and the irreversible fouling reached 14 23 1012 m 1 after four cycle filtration the permeability of the fourth cycle was only 68 2 of the first cycle and the irreversible pollution appeared serious in the first cycle after na4 edta cleaning the irreversible membrane fouling increased less only 2 9 1012 m 1 the growth efficiency of irreversible fouling in each of the following three cycles was slow and the increment gradually decreased after the final fourth chemical cleaning cycle the irreversible fouling only increased to 6 58 1012 m 1 and the permeability recovery efficiency remained at approximately 82 the development of membrane fouling in naoh based cleaning scenario was close to that of na4 edta but the effect was not as good as that of na4 edta the membrane resistance of naoh based nf process was significantly higher than that of na4 edta in every cycle na sds conferred the best cleaning effect in the first cycle and the irreversible membrane fouling was the lowest approximately just 1 78 1012 m 1 but na sds based cleaning procedure was different from other cleaning reagents in that the increment of irreversible membrane fouling in the fourth cycle was larger than that in the second and third cycles which resulted in the accumulation of irreversible membrane fouling after four cycles being higher than that of na4 edta reaching approximately 7 84 1012 m 1 such results should be related to that some monomers of the surfactant in the repeated cleaning process were adsorbed on the membrane surface thereby increasing the membrane filtration resistance 35 another nf study has also reported such a phenomenon 21 a similar phenomenon was found to be more pronounced for cationic surfactants since the surface of the nf membranes was predominantly negatively charged therefore for the nf membrane fouling caused by the organic foulants na sds was optimized as the best chemical cleaning with the highest membrane permeability recovery in terms of irreversible membrane fouling control although na sds performed better in a single cleaning the little difference was observed from that of na4 edta during long term operation due to the adsorption of the surfactant reagent monomer 3 2 removal efficiency and migration law of sm2 sm2 was selected as a typical trace organic compound to investigate the contribution of nf to the removal of trace organics and the stability of nf to the removal of trace organics under chemical cleaning conditions the molecular weight of sm2 was 300 da and the effect of nf270 on the removal of sm2 during chemical cleaning was more clearly evaluated fig 5 displays the variety in the removal efficiency of sm2 compared to the new nf membrane with sm2 removal efficiency of 64 6 it was found that the decrease of sm2 removal efficiency was positively correlated with the degree of membrane fouling with the aggravation of membrane fouling the removal effect of sm2 became worse so its removal rate decreased more seriously after chemical cleaning the reduction of the removal efficiency could be alleviated to a certain extent but none of them could be beneficial to the removal of trace organics or completely alleviate the problem of the removal efficiency reduction previous studies indicated that the membrane fouling was not conducive to the removal of trace organic compounds by the nf process 36 the potential explanation was related to that the fouling caused by calcium ion adsorption on the membrane surface would weaken the electrostatic repulsion effect resulting in the fouling layer absorbing the trace organics and causing the membrane surface concentration to increase at the same time the change in hydrophilic hydrophobic interaction and concentration polarization would also be changed accordingly specifically the mitigation effect of citric acid on the attenuation of the sm2 removal efficiency was limited but when the filtration time was 3 h the removal efficiency of sm2 after chemical cleaning decreased by 1 2 compared with that before cleaning interestingly although it has been proved in the previous section that na4 edta and na sds were both effective and little difference was found in controlling the nf fouling obvious differences between the two cleaning agents in the removal of trace organics were observed na4 edta conferred higher capability in alleviating the decrease of sm2 removal efficiency than na sds in the most fouled group membrane fouling caused a 9 2 drop in the removal efficiency of sm2 compared with the clean membrane the removal efficiency of sm2 just decreased by 5 7 after cleaning with na sds while the removal efficiency of sm2 decreased by only 1 9 after cleaning with na4 edta the above phenomenon also had similar results in other groups fig 6 showed the material balance analysis of sm2 in the system when the nf membrane intercepted sm2 under different conditions the mass distribution ratio of sm2 in the system when sm2 was retained by nf membrane under different conditions was analyzed due to the adsorption of the cake layer attached on the membrane surface the fouled nf membrane would significantly increase the accumulation of sm2 on the membrane surface 37 38 however after comparing na4 edta and na sds cleaning it was found that chelating reagents and surfactants could alleviate organics induced membrane fouling and reduce the deposition of trace organics after chemical cleaning although the percentage of residual sm2 on the membrane surface decreased there was no significant difference between the two special chemical cleaners however from the variety of the removal efficiency of sm2 in fig 6 it could be inferred that the migration of trace organics in the membrane system should not be the main factor affecting the improvement of the membrane retention effect of the chemical cleaning reagents 3 3 membrane characterization after chemical cleaning 3 3 1 analysis of functional group properties the ati ftir spectra of the nf membranes cleaned with different reagents are shown in fig 7 it could be seen that the intrinsic nf270 membrane without any fouling showed the typical characteristic peaks of the polyamide functional and support layer it could be seen that 1488 cm 1 1504 cm 1 and 1580 cm 1 were the stretching vibration peaks in the phenyl ring these characteristic peaks were superimposed on characteristic peaks of the polyamide layer and polysulfone layer 39 such results elucidated that the thickness of the polyamide functional layer on the surface of nf270 was small so the characteristic peaks of the polysulfone support layer were detected by infrared rays the spectrum of fouled nf delivered absorption peaks at 3400 cm 1 1630 cm 1 and 1420 cm 1 which was consistent with the characteristic that the main nom in songhua river water was humus 40 at the same time the main characteristic peaks of the nf membrane were weakened after chemical cleaning the characteristic peaks of the nf270 support layer were observed again the red circle in fig 7 41 the recovery efficiencies of the characteristic peaks after chemical cleaning with different reagents were different which were mainly reflected in the highest recovery intensity of naoh na4 edta and na sds indicating that such three chemical reagents conferred the best removal effect on organic foulants especially after edta cleaning the characteristic peaks of the nf270 support layer basically recovered and were similar to that of the new membrane comparing the cleaning effects of the four reagents it could be found that the characteristic peaks of humic substances were weakened indicating that the chemical cleaning mainly contributed to the removals of nom contaminants from the spectral point of view limited differences in the effects of the four cleaning processes were observed from the recovery results of the penetration performance in section 3 1 3 3 2 morphology observation of membrane surface by sem fig 8 is the sem images of nf membranes with or without chemical cleaning a rough fouling layer was found on the surface of the fouled nf membrane without any cleaning reagents different from low pressure membranes such as uf nf membranes rarely blocked the membrane pores and the formation of cake layer caused by small molecular organic substances was the main cause of the membrane fouling after chemical cleaning the foulants accumulated on the membrane surface were reduced in the acid based cleaning part of the foulants still left on the membrane surface and the cake layer could also be obviously visualized compared with the membrane before cleaning the cake layer was reduced but it was denser and had a gel like shape the membrane surface was rather clean and smooth after cleaning using the na4 edta and na sds indicating that the cleaning process could effectively remove the fouling layer adhering to the surface of the nf membrane 3 3 3 quantification of membrane surface roughness by afm the images of the nf membrane surface captured by the afm under different chemical cleaning conditions are shown in fig 9 and the roughness of the membrane surface was also quantified in this study no significant scaling problem was observed since the feed water of nf process was pretreated by the bank filter consequently the increased roughness of the fouled membrane surface originated from the formation of organics induced cake layer attached on the membrane surface the roughness of the cake layer would affect the hydraulic conditions during nf operation which resulted in a reduction of the effective pressure at the same time the rough membrane surface was more liable to cause the accumulation of foulants especially organic pollutants further facilitating the membrane fouling it could be seen that the roughness of the fouled membrane surface was 260 nm and the chemical cleaning could effectively restore the smoothness of the membrane surface by removing the organic matter on the membrane surface to reduce its roughness in the case of acid based chemical cleaning the roughness foulant membrane surface was reduced to 177 nm and further reduced to 125 nm in the scenario of alkaline based cleaning the effect of na4 edta and na sds was good and consistent with the results of flux recovery and the membrane surface roughness was the lowest after cleaning compared to the fouled membrane the roughness of nf membrane surface after cleaning with na4 edta and na sds was decreased to 97 nm and 82 nm respectively which also proved the cleaning effect from the membrane surface morphology 21 3 3 4 molecular fluorescence spectrometer the nf membranes before and after chemical cleaning were characterized by solid phase eem since the nf270 used in this experiment was mainly made of polyamide a strong response was observed in fe eem under solid phase conditions centered in the region of ex em 205 354 nm the clean nf membrane mainly showed the self response of polyamide but such response was attenuated with membrane fouling occurring 33 39 42 this was mainly because the nom dominated fouling layer covered the membrane surface when treating songhua river water under solid phase conditions nom had no obvious florescent response due to the presence of highly absorbing colored groups so that it would shelter the response of polyamide in solid phase eem in the present experiment the difference of the eem of the membrane surface between fouled and after chemical cleaning was used to evaluate the chemical cleaning effect by the characteristic response change of the polyamide area as shown in fig 10 it could be seen that the polyamide self response after chemical cleaning was recovered compared with citric acid cleaning the two special chemical cleaning reagents na4 edta and na sds could remove more contaminants and make the filter cake layer thinner to significantly improve the response of the polyamide 43 3 3 5 element distribution changes on the membrane surface the fouled and cleaned nf membranes were tested by xps to analyze the amount of calcium ions deposited on the membrane surface table 1 shows the xps spectrum and element content analysis of nf membranes under different conditions the o n ratio of the clean nf membrane was 2 which was in line with the o n ratio range of the polyamide membrane 44 45 however with the increase of organic pollutants accumulated on the membrane surface all kinds of natural organic matter had become the main characteristic substances this resulted in an increase in the o content and a decrease in the s content at the same time the calcium content of the fouled membrane increased the potential explanation was that some of the calcium ions were attracted by the negatively charged nf membrane surface the other part of the calcium ions had a bridging effect with natural organics e g humus and calcium ions have existed on the membrane surface during the formation of the filter cake layer in comparison with the elemental changes on the membrane surface after chemical cleaning it could be seen that the c o ratio of the nf membrane after acid cleaning was basically the same as that before cleaning which indicated that the effect of the acid cleaning on the organic fouling control was ineffective on the other hand the proportion of calcium ions after acid cleaning was higher than that of fouled membranes this may be due to the poor cleaning effect of acid cleaning on organic pollution and the strong complex formed by organic pollution and calcium ions was not well removed it could also be seen from the sem image that the nf membrane surface was dense and in gel like shape after acid cleaning which promoted the aggregation of calcium ions on the membrane surface in the scenarios of the two special reagents na4 edta and na sds the c o ratio of the membrane surface changed significantly indicating that the cleaning process efficiently removed the organic matter accumulated on the membrane surface however the proportion of calcium on the membrane surface was different after cleaning with such two reagents the calcium concentration after na sds cleaning was the highest reaching 1 18 this was mainly because the cleaning process of the two reagents was under alkaline conditions which was not conducive to releasing calcium ions due to the electrostatic adsorption by the membrane surface on the other hand the active reagent monomer remained on the membrane surface after cleaning 46 these residual active agents increased the negative charge on the membrane surface which was also not conducive to removing calcium ions 21 as a consequence the calcium ions on the membrane surface increased after na sds cleaning but after na4 edta cleaning the calcium ions content decreased significantly as a chelating agent na4 edta would form a strong complex with calcium ions due to coordination therefore nom molecules interacting with calcium ions were replaced by edta through a ligand exchange reaction making the foulants easier to be washed off from the membrane surface 47 at the same time the calcium ions between the filter cake layer were also taken away as a result the proportion of calcium on the surface of the membrane after cleaning was only 0 64 3 4 energy consumption analysis chemical cleaning would not only affect the membrane surface properties but also influence the development of membrane fouling in the next cycle for the entire filtration cycle whether these effects had an impact on the energy consumption of the cycle operation was the point we focused on in this study therefore we investigated the variation in energy consumption of the complete cycle filtration process after chemical cleaning and the results are shown in fig 11 it could be found that for the new nf270 the proportion of other energy was only 3 64 this part of the energy consumption was mainly related to the flow channel of the nf small test component after multiple cycles of fouling and cleaning the proportion of the other energy increased significantly in the case with low cleaning efficiency among them the proportion of other energy in citric acid based cleaning reached 13 35 48 compared with the energy consumption of na sds and acid based cleaning na4 edta performed much better and could further reduce other energy consumption by 2 47 and 4 54 respectively under the premise of merely calculating the membrane surface s energy consumption without considering the pump s conversion efficiency and other factors the membrane fouling caused an extra energy consumption of 0 288 kwh which was a huge energy cost however we could reduce energy consumption by removing or alleviating membrane fouling with an effective chemical cleaning method 49 for example na4 edta cleaning could reduce energy consumption by 4 54 compared to the case using acid cleaning the unfavorable power consumption per ton of water was reduced to 0 220 kwh the electricity consumption per ton of water was saved by 0 068 kwh energy consumption could be reduced through the chemical cleaning process which effectively improved the operational stability of nf process 3 5 mechanisms of na4 edta and na sds based cleaning the above results showed that the fouled nf membrane exerted a rough filter cake layer 50 52 unlike uf membranes although nf also has pollutants that block membrane pores in the songhua river water treatment process the filter cake layer fouling caused by small molecular organics is the main membrane fouling 33 52 na4 edta and na sds involved chemical cleaning conferred more excellent permeability recovery and the possible mechanism is illustrated in fig 12 as a chelating reagent na4 edta can coordinate with calcium ions to form strong complexes and nom molecules interacting with calcium ions would be replaced by the edta through ligand exchange reaction 53 the stability of the cake layer was destroyed making contaminants accumulated on the nf membrane surface easier to be washed away 23 33 at the same time the calcium ions deposited within the cake layers were also washed away during the chemical cleaning process resulting in a significant reduction in the proportion of calcium ions on the membrane surface after cleaning 20 the roughness of the film surface was reduced and the film surface under sem was clean as a surfactant na sds mainly relied on the hydrophobic end of the active agent to adhere to organic matters and dissolve the organic fouling layer 24 33 54 at the same time the bridge effect formed by calcium ions and organic matters was decomposed and part of the calcium ions was released and washed away under alkaline conditions the membrane was negatively charged and the hydrophobic end of na sds would be close to the membrane interface 50 55 the active monomers remaining on the membrane surface can increase the negative charge of the membrane surface 16 which was not conducive to the removal of calcium ions thus the calcium ions on the membrane surface would increase after na sds cleaning both sds and edta based chemical cleaning reduced the roughness of the membrane surface from the characterization of afm after cleaning 4 conclusion in this study the chemical cleaning efficiency and membrane fouling control of the nf process using four typical chemical cleaning reagents were evaluated the main conclusions were as follows 1 na sds based cleaning had the highest cleaning efficiency and the permeability could be recovered by 94 2 in the single cycle operation in terms of irreversible fouling control na4 edta based cleaning had the best performance and the irreversible resistance was only 6 58 1012 m 1 after four cycles which was better than that of na sds 2 na4 edta based cleaning performed better in mitigating the decrease of sm2 removal efficiency compared to the scenario of na sds but a limited difference was observed in the transfer results of sm2 between the two former reagents the migration of trace organics was not the main factor for the two reagents i e na4 edta and na sds to influence the membrane rejection 3 as a chelating reagent na4 edta could coordinate with calcium ions to form strong complexes and nom molecules interacting with calcium ions would be replaced by the edta through ligand exchange reaction edta could destabilize the filter cake layer making it easier for contaminants accumulated on the nf membrane surface to be washed away 4 na sds mainly relied on the hydrophobic end of the active agent to adsorb organic matter the bridging effect formed by calcium ions and organic matter was decomposed the organic fouling layer was dissolved and part of the calcium ions was released and washed away however after repeated chemical cleaning the active monomers would remain on the membrane surface which would increase the negative charge on the membrane surface during the long term operation na sds was not conducive to the removal of calcium ions 5 in terms of energy consumption control the effect of na4 edta was better than na sds compared with other reagents na4 edta based cleaning reduced other energy consumption by 4 54 energy consumption could be reduced and the operation stability of nf treatment could be effectively improved by

capacity for the depletion of carbendazim constructed wetland study with leca and phytoremediation using chrysopogon zizanioides yielded maximum removal efficiency of carbendazim in the range of 96 99 6 which corroborated closely with the results from the hydrus model results demonstrate the combined efficacious use of leca and chrysopogon zizanioides to abate carbendazim from wastewater which can be recommended as a cost effective solution for its field scale applications graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords carbendazim fungicide constructed wetland isotherm and kinetics hydrus data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction pesticide is a substance used to control the population of insects weeds fungi and all sorts of harmful pests almost 40 of agricultural products are lost worldwide due to plant diseases and pest attacks pesticides help control all these damages and significantly increase crop production 1 despite their beneficial application pesticides have detrimental effects on the environment with lingering action on humans and other animals 2 carbendazim methyl benzimidazole 2 yl carbamate mbc is a systematic broad spectrum fungicide that belongs to the benzimidazole class and is a 2 aminobenzimidazole with a methoxycarbonyl group substituting for the primary amino group carbendazim is widely used in india to control fungal diseases in several vegetables fruits medicinal herbs ornamental plants and turf grasses 3 4 and also in paper leather textile and paint industries 5 carbendazim is persistent due to its benzimidazole ring which is difficult to break 6 7 the slow degradation of this compound and bioaccumulation adversely affect humans other mammalian species and microorganisms carbendazim is a possible human carcinogen and high doses of it influence the hypothalamus pituitary gonad axis thereby damaging the testicles of animals and causing infertility 8 9 according to singh et al 10 carbendazim not only messes with the microbial community structure in ecosystems but also induces aneugenic and mutagenic effects and causes apoptosis hepatocellular dysfunction disruption of hematological functions teratogenicity mitotic spindle abnormalities and embryo toxicity as per the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac the health value for carbendazim in drinking water in australia is 0 1 mg l where health values are calculated from the average daily intake usually 10 for a 70 kg adult consuming 2 l of water per day 11 according to is 10500 2012 12 the maximum pesticide residue level in drinking water is 190 μg l without any exemptions however the widespread usage of carbendazim in forestry and agriculture paves the entry of this contaminant into the aquatic systems where concentrations as high as 4 5 mg l were found 10 which is well over the permissible limit this is of alarming concern in developing countries like india where a considerable population relies on these aquatic systems only for drinking water thus inviting the pesticides into their bodies leading to health complications hence proper usage of effective methods for removing carbendazim from surface water and wastewater is a vital issue that needs addressing to protect human health researchers have adopted various techniques to remediate carbendazim and other pesticides from wastewater advanced oxidation process aop in the presence of h2o2 tio2 and uv 13 15 bio stimulation and bio catalysis 16 photocatalytic treatment 17 phytoremediation combined with the presence of carbendazim degrading bacterial strains such as bacillus subtilis paracoccus sp flavobacterium sp and pseudomonas sp 18 20 and adsorption through solid adsorbents like bentonite silica montmorillonite and activated charcoal 21 25 are some of the treatment techniques which have been applied several artificially manufactured adsorbents including graphene oxide metal organic frameworks and activated carbon 26 27 as well as naturally occurring adsorbents including agricultural residues zeolites and clay minerals 28 29 have been recognized for attenuation of carbendazim synthetic sorbents are excessively expensive limiting their use to laboratory investigations only and preventing widespread application in the field as a result adsorbents like zeolite cork kaolinite and lightweight expanded clay aggregate leca with an exceptional specific surface area and outstanding compound stability have recently become the focus as the choice of bed materials in constructed wetland and have piqued the interest of researchers 30 33 keeping all of these in view the present study is focused on the development of a cost effective wastewater treatment system in the form of an artificially constructed wetland using silty sandy soil 34 or leca 35 as primary bed material with the inclusion of chrysopogon zizanioides as major macrophyte to treat carbendazim laden wastewater silty sandy soil and leca have been previously proved as excellent adsorbents for organic contaminants with removal efficiencies reaching as high as 97 30 34 vetiver is a perennial bunchgrass of the family poaceae that grows up to 1 5 m in height under favorable conditions and has a typical downward growing root system 36 this species has been employed for soil erosion resistance oil extraction and fodder vetiver can sustain a wide range of ph and grow in various soils 37 vetiver is also vividly used for contaminant remediation and has proved to be successful in the removal of a wide variety of organic contaminants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pesticides antibiotics and heavy metals 38 44 several researchers have also reported the excellent potential of chrysopogon zizanioides while used in constructed wetlands for effective removal of a wide variety of contaminants ranging from domestic wastewater to heavy metals poly aromatic hydrocarbons and antibiotics 45 50 however the efficiency of silty sandy soil leca and vetiver alone or in combination have not been examined for abatement of carbendazim pollution using constructed wetlands in the present study the physicochemical properties of soil and leca were determined as per the guidelines depicted in the bureau of indian standards 51 55 using the response surface methodology approach the effects of various significant factors like adsorbent dosage contact time and initial contaminant concentration were estimated to determine the maximum contaminant removal efficiencies under both static and dynamic adsorption processes to obtain a better adsorbent for use as bed material in a laboratory scale constructed wetland setup additionally the kinetics and isotherm of carbendazim adsorption by the soil and leca were evaluated which provided the necessary information related to the adsorption capacity of the two materials further to influence the choice of geo media for wetland beds finally the findings of the experimental results were verified using the hydrus software package which effectively simulates the fate and transport of contaminants in porous media 56 the scope adopted in the investigation is believed to highlight the adsorptive behavior of aqueous carbendazim in geo media and the potential of the mitigating processes planned in this context to address societal health problems 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials sorbent hydraulic conductivity plays a crucial role in wetlands and must be considered when selecting a wetland site according to usepa 625 1 88 022 1998 the ideal range is from 10 4 to 10 5 cm s 34 the silty sand used in potato fields was obtained from the durgapur barrage area west bengal india 34 leca was procured from suyog plastics a commercial firm based in gujarat india leca is made by heating clay materials to roughly 1300 c 57 due to the evaporation of pore water and other organic compounds and the addition of expansion agents such as sawdust clay expands fast during this process leca comprises pellets varying in size from 1 to 32 mm in diameter with an average bulk density of 400 600 kg m3 it has a honeycomb interior and a smooth ceramic like exterior layer 58 59 the present study used leca pellets ranging from 5 to 8 mm chrysopogon zizanioides used in the present study were purchased from a local nursery in durgapur india 100 pure carbendazim was used in the study procured from cdh chemicals india all aqueous solutions of carbendazim were prepared using deionized water mixed with 2 ethanol the soil was collected using the auger boring method and stored in sterilized bags to avoid contamination leca was first washed under running water and then oven dried to remove suspended solid particulates 2 2 quality assurance and quality control all analyses were done in triplicates with the average value calculated from there within a 5 margin of error the maximum values were obtained those values were considered while the other values were discarded chemicals of analytical grade were used throughout a double distilled water free of ammonia was prepared in the laboratory and was used to prepare the spiked samples standard curves were monitored regularly and the calibration standards were logged in a data storage file furthermore primary qc qa objectives such as the fabrication of spiked samples reference samples and blanks for making standards standard protocols and replicates epa apha guidelines 60 were followed as precisely as possible precision accuracy and bias homogeneity were maintained all of the analytical equipment used in the inquiry was calibrated and maintained as per the instructions of the manufacturer and best practices using standard reference solutions supplied by the manufacturer or obtained from reliable sources general awareness was also employed to evade contamination of samples special measures taken during sample collection included proper capping pre cleaning and dust protection 2 3 physico chemical characterization physicochemical characterization of silty sand and leca was conducted in the laboratory under standard temperature and pressure stp conforming to the guidelines in is 2720 1983 51 55 a similar approach was also adopted by adhikary et al 34 2 4 phzpc test zero surface charge points of leca and silty sandy soil were established using the phzpc experiment the specific ph of the adsorbent at which its surface is devoid of adsorbed h3o and oh ions is known as the ph of zero point charge 150 mg of adsorbent was shaken in 50 ml of a 0 01 m sodium chloride nacl solution with a pre set ph using a bod shaker for 24 h using hcl and naoh in varying concentrations the ph was initially changed to five levels ranging from 2 to 10 afterward the samples were filtered using a vacuum filter rechecking the ph of the filtrates was done and plotting the initial ph on the horizontal axis versus ph phfinal phinitial on the vertical axis yielded the zero point charge ph 2 5 batch adsorption test and response surface methodology batch experiments were executed to assess carbendazim adsorption through soil and leca to obtain equilibrium kinetics and isotherms at first a conventional approach was made to check the equilibrium time a dose of 1 g of soil and an initial solute concentration of 12 ppm were fixed and contact time was varied from 30 min to 24 h then after getting the equilibrium time the soil dose was varied from 0 5 g up to 2 g and the initial concentration from 4 mg l to 12 mg l to check variation in adsorption the maximum concentration of carbendazim was fixed at 12 mg l after that the range of adsorbent dose time of contact and initial concentration of carbendazim were chosen accordingly design expert statistical package software has been utilized to determine experimental design using response surface methodology rsm which explores the relationships between multiple explanatory variables and one or more response variables in the conventional method single variables are optimized one after the other to check their influence on final responses but this does not allow changing all the independent factors simultaneously and observing the combined effect 61 therefore response surface methodology rsm was adopted to use parameters used in experimental design effectively the main idea of rsm is to use a sequence of designed experiments to obtain an optimal response the main advantage of using rsm is that it reduces experimental trials and evaluates the influence of different factors on a particular response 62 in contrast to conventional methods the interaction among process variables can be determined by statistical techniques the time of contact 63 64 and adsorbent dosage 34 65 are two of the most important factors considered in the rsm design along with input contaminant concentration being the third one other researchers have adopted similar concentration ranges 66 68 screening characterization robust parameter design combined designs comparative testing mixture designs and optimization are all features of design expert statistical software dedicated to performing experiment design 69 the process parameters were optimized using the box behnken model bbd for maximal carbendazim removal the bbd model offers 15 viable options accordingly adsorbent doses ranged from 10 to 40 g l time of contact was kept between 4 and 8 h and carbendazim concentrations varied from 4 to 12 mg l 67 a temperature of 25 c and a shaker speed of 150 rpm was maintained the solutions were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min before using the vacuum filtering procedure the solutions output concentration was determined using a uv visible spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 285 nm 6 67 the following two equations analyzed the removal efficiency 1 adsorbent sorption capacity qe c i c e m v 2 carbendazim removal c i c e c i 100 where ci is the input concentration of carbendazim mg l ce is the equilibrium concentration mg l v is the sample volume l m is the adsorbent mass gram qe is the amount of carbendazim adsorbed per unit mass of adsorbent mg g and r is percentage removal of carbendazim 2 6 ph variation the initial ph of the adsorption system substantially affects the adsorption of contaminants as it affects the binding nature of sorbate and the morphology of the sorbent surface 70 ph dependent sorption is significant in explaining the transport and distribution of organic compounds in adsorbent adsorbate interfaces 71 73 changes aid the deprotonation of antibiotic functional groups in ph the ability of these moieties to receive electrons is influenced by ph changes which suppresses or elevates cation π bonding and π π stacking 74 the ph was changed from 2 to 10 for this experiment using hcl and naoh solutions 2 7 temperature variation temperature also plays a vital role in the adsorption of organic contaminants on sorbents an increase in temperature decreases the viscosity of the solution thereby enhancing the rate of molecular diffusion thus it becomes easier for contaminant molecules to cross the external boundary layer and move into the internal pores of sorbents 75 76 in this study the temperature was varied from 5 c to 45 c with an interval of 10 c 2 8 isotherm studies to find the best fitting isotherm model the equilibrium concentration data from batch adsorption trials were employed in three alternative models linear langmuir 77 and freundlich 78 models 2 9 kinetic studies batch adsorption experiments provided the data for equilibrium concentrations to determine the best fit utilizing correlation data three distinct kinetic models were considered intra particle diffusion 79 pseudo second order 80 and elovich 81 the following equation was used to calculate soil sorption capacity qt at time t qt mg g 3 q t c i c e t m v where ce t is the equilibrium concentration mg l at a particular time t 2 10 one dimensional soil column experiment to evaluate the adsorption of carbendazim in soil and leca a dynamic flow through condition was created using a laboratory scale column filtering approach as depicted in fig 1 this experiment used a vertical flow one dimensional column design a perspex cylinder with a 25 mm internal diameter and height of 300 mm was used in which silty sandy soil was poured up to a height of 30 mm another test was conducted for leca using a bigger column of a diameter of 60 mm and an adsorbent height of 200 mm to get an appropriate breakthrough curve because the saturated hydraulic conductivity for leca is relatively high glass beads were placed at the top of the column to ensure an equitable solution distribution glass wool was placed at the bottom to prevent adsorbent drainage from the outlet the sorbent was placed in the column in layers up to the necessary height with 85 relative compaction to avoid clogging throughout the experiment sidewall flow is always a concern for packed columns generally caused by flexing the column walls during or after soil packing or improper packing of the columns the wall effect results in a preferential flow path which leads to spatial heterogeneity that ultimately results in significant bias in experimental results there are several approaches to negate the side wall effect sand gluing roughening of walls and installation of annular rings 82 in this study a very thin layer of sand was glued to the inner side of the columns to avoid the bias in results caused by the wall effect the concentration of carbendazim was kept at 12 mg l throughout and the leachates were collected at regular intervals from the outlet a uv visible spectrophotometer with a wavelength of 285 nm was used to measure carbendazim exit concentrations 2 11 construction of wetland the optimum removal efficiency of an adsorbent differs from the static batch condition when subjected to dynamic flow through conditions as in constructed wetland depending on the results from static batch experiments it was planned to use either silty sandy soil or leca in constructed wetland experiments four identical laboratory scale vertical surface flow created wetlands with dimensions of 520 mm 340 mm 320 mm were put up for the study as exhibited in fig 2 one wetland was scheduled to use adsorbent silty sand or leca up to a height of 200 mm chrysopogon zizanioides was planted in the other wetland two wetlands were kept as control units with only distilled water replacing the contaminant solution one wetland was without vegetation while the other one was planted a holed plate and steel wool were placed below the soil bed to prevent leaching about two months were selected in the planned setup to allow time for proper development of the root zone which was supposed to act as the principal contaminant uptake unit of the plant after the elapsed period of 2 months 12 mg l carbendazim solution was poured intermittently for 6 h cycles to test the efficacy of the wetland for adsorption 2 12 hydrus modeling hydrus includes computational finite element models for simulating single and multi dimensional heat fluid and solute transport in partially inundated porous media hydrus was used to simulate two and three dimensional numerical models in this investigation hydrus program is used to solve fick s advection dispersion equation for solute transport and richard s equation for saturated unsaturated water flow advective dispersive transport is considered in the liquid phase while diffusion for the gaseous phase the controlling flow and transport equations are numerically solved using the galerkin type linear finite element techniques 2 12 1 standard solute transport the software replicated the experimental column studies using a conventional solute transport model to verify the laboratory results the numerical model was built using the same data set as the column experiments 34 2 12 2 constructed wetland cw2d hydrus water flow and solute transport program includes cw2d reactive transport module which was created to characterize wetland degradation processes and biochemical transformations 83 84 cw2d module takes into account thirteen different components and nine different processes it also assumes a constant concentration of microorganisms in each finite element the flow equation includes a sink term to account for water uptake by plant roots according to dittmer et al 85 hydrus plant uptake models which describe nutrient and water uptake could be used to simulate plant uptake in massive loaded systems the simulation findings for low strength wastewater show that these models overemphasize potential nutrient uptake the present study simulated the experimental laboratory scale wetland using a cw2d module the pesticide was introduced as slowly biodegradable organic matter and the model was run continuously for 24 h with sporadic contaminant loading every 6 h the above models employed data from batch adsorption isotherm and kinetic investigations as input parameters 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of adsorbent a potentially effective adsorbent must have a high affinity for adsorption porosity and specific surface area reversibility becomes an important criterion as the recovery of the adsorbent is needed in case of costly synthetically manufactured adsorbents physicochemical characterization of leca and silty sandy soil has been shown in table 1 3 2 zero point charge the effect of surface functionality on pesticide adsorption may be complicated by the charge characteristics of the adsorbent surface henceforth all experiments were performed using these adsorbents by keeping ph equal to their respective phzpc values the zero point charge ph of soil and leca were determined and the results are shown in fig 3 the surface of the adsorbent is positively charged if the ph is lesser than the phzpc value and negatively charged if the ph is greater than phzpc it can be observed from the figure that for leca the zero point is shifted towards the right with a phzpc value of around 8 as compared to silty sandy soil which has a phzpc value of about 7 this shifting of phzpc towards the alkaline region indicates that initially the surface had abundant negative charges which is true for leca as it contained more clay particles than silty sandy soil and the clay surface had negative charges 3 3 batch adsorption results laboratory scale batch tests were conducted to simulate the static non flow through system that provides the adsorption capacity of the sorbents using the conventional method it was found that maximum adsorption occurred at around 4 h after that the increasing time did not have any significant changes in adsorption as the effluent concentration was constant for up to 8 h the effluent concentration increased after that which might be due to desorption bbd produced 15 trial runs with different combinations of input parameters to optimize the removal efficiency the results produced by these batch tests are shown in table 2 among other models design expert suggested the best fitting for the mentioned cases through anova analysis tabulated in table 3 the two most important parameters to judge the efficacy of a model are fisher s f value and probability p value the higher f value indicates more accuracy of the model in predicting the outcomes and the p value should be 0 05 it can be seen from table 3 that in the case of silty sandy soil the initial contaminant concentration c c2 alone and in combination with sorbent dosage and contact time ac bc b2 is a significant parameter controlling removal efficiency whereas in the case of leca all the three input parameters are deemed significant on their own a b c and in combination ab ac bc c2 the contribution of initial contaminant concentration in the whole system is one of the most crucial aspects driving the results as intra parametric quadratic reactions are also deemed significant for both the adsorbents this implies that the whole adsorption system heavily depends on initial carbendazim concentration the results also define that the choice of parameters and the range of values are more appropriate for leca than silty sandy soil this signifies that interaction between input parameters is much more in the case of leca which might be a reason for more adsorption of carbendazim using leca compared to silty sandy soil fit statistics table 4 show that the quadratic model best fits soil and leca with a difference between adjusted and predicted r2 values of 0 2 34 anova analysis has shown overall model was significant in both cases with a p value of 0 0014 and 0 0002 and f values of 23 59 and 52 61 for soil and leca respectively the model f value for leca was more than twice that of silty sandy soil which indicates that in the given input parameter conditions leca was a more potential candidate than silty sandy soil for the adsorption of carbendazim from wastewater the increase in sample size increases the r2 value significantly and the adjusted r2 nullifies the effect of sample size and if the difference is 0 2 then it can be stated that the sample size does have little or no significance in this present study removal efficiencies of soil and leca as final responses were obtained from rsm results eqs 4 and 5 are presented in terms of actual factors explaining how closely the intra variable and inter variable interactions affect the adsorption process positive and negative factors indicate favorable and adverse effects respectively 4 removal efficiency of soil 54 09 1 26 soil dose 6 96 contact time 6 71 initial conc 0 062198 soil dose contact time 0 13 soil

leca dose contact time 0 04 leca dose initial conc 0 42 contact time initial conc 0 01 leca dose 2 0 85 contact time 2 0 69 initial conc 2 the given levels for each factor specified in the original units of those factors can be predicted using the actual factor equations for both equations the intercept is non zero which states that the intercept is not at the center of the design space defining the mean of the input parameter conditions thus these equations must not be used to determine the relative impact of each factor the intercept of the leca eq 14 04 is much closer to the center in compared to the soil eq 54 09 indicating that in the case of the second design the deviation of the design function is less at the center due to the presence of more data points there this indicates that small errors occur near the design points and moderate errors are experienced near the design center and at the design perimeter designs with points that are pushed closer to the center of the design afford considerably more protection against bias errors 86 in this study the targeted optimal removal efficiency parameter condition was kept to be at best economically viable condition by keeping adsorbent dosage 10 g l and contact time 4 h as minimum and carbendazim concentration 12 mg l as maximum which deviates from the mean parametric values viz dosage of 25 g l a contact time of 6 h and initial concentration of 8 mg l so that the error occurring is negligible negative and positive coefficients define the opposing and favorable effects of carbendazim removal when the concentration of a factor is raised the reaction gets better however the response doesn t get better when the factor has a negative effect 87 according to the above equations contact time and initial concentration influenced adsorption in both cases the adsorbent dose had a negative effect in the case of soil but not in the case of leca this contrasting nature of soil and leca in terms of dosage could have been caused by the limited adsorption sites in silty sandy soil compared to a more significant number of sites present in leca the comparative high adsorption capacity of leca also being indicative of this ramp plots fig 4 and contour plots fig 5 indicate optimized results for soil and leca after triplicating the experiments an average removal value of 57 and 70 were obtained for soil and leca respectively from the batch study at optimum conditions leca showed higher efficiency in adsorbing carbendazim than silty sandy soil so leca was taken as the main adsorbent in the cw bed 3 4 effect of ph fig 6 demonstrates the variation of adsorptive capacities of the studied sorbents with changes in ph it is observed that with the change in ph from the acidic to the alkaline range the adsorption decreased for both the sorbents while for silty sandy soil the change in adsorption was gradual leca showed more steep variation in both the cases highly acidic conditions provided the best results which might be due to the fact that in acidic ph carbendazim is adsorbed by the clay fraction of the sorbents and leca had more clay content than silty sandy soil which resulted in higher adsorption the change in ph from neutral to alkaline region did not show any drastic changes in adsorption this leads to the conclusion that due to protonation carbendazim was predominantly adsorbed by the minerals rather than neutral molecules generally adsorbed by organic matter which was negligible for both sorbents similar results were obtained by paszko 88 according to li et al 76 the adsorption of ionizable organic compounds is ph dependent due to the presence of varied species which strongly affects solubility this phenomenon is also due to the π π electron donor acceptor interaction which is one of the significant forces for the adsorption of organic compounds containing benzene rings 3 5 effect of temperature the influence of temperature on antibiotic adsorption was investigated by varying the temperature from 5 c to 45 c in 10 c intervals the adsorption of carbendazim was shown to increase with the increment in temperature fig 7 a steeper change is observed for leca than in silty sandy soil which might be due to more clay particles in leca this improvement in adsorption with temperature increase may be caused by either a rise in the number of binding sites on the soil or a surge in their affinity for carbendazim the carbendazim solvent system is temperature sensitive and when the temperature goes up carbendazim becomes less hydrophilic and more compact which increases surface activity and hence physical adsorption capacity of both the adsorbents also a rise in temperature of the system increases protonated fraction of carbendazim which was much more readily adsorbed than the molecular fraction a similar observation was stated by li et al 89 3 6 adsorption isotherm and kinetics the adsorption isotherm for soil and leca was evaluated by varying the initial concentration of carbendazim from 2 to 12 mg l keeping a constant adsorbent dose of 0 5 g and constant contact time of 4 h langmuir model provided the best fit in both cases as shown in table 5 which indicates strong monolayer adsorption of carbendazim on both sorbents the results show the adsorption capacity of leca 1 2657 mg g to be more than twice that of silty sandy soil 0 5009 mg g which might be due to more clay content in leca thus generating more active sites for sorption also the fact that negatively charged clay particles generally help to bind the protonated form of carbendazim resulting in a stronger bond between leca and carbendazim compared to silty sandy soil adsorption kinetics is mainly assessed to determine the rate of contaminant uptake through adsorbent with respect to time at a constant adsorbent and adsorbate dose it also determines the adsorption process duration and helps find the equilibrium time 34 90 among different kinetics models studied pseudo second order was found well fitted for both adsorbents as shown in table 5 it is termed pseudo because the equation is based on the amount of adsorbed material on the adsorbent instead of the concentration in the liquid the pseudo second order rate constant tends to decrease with the increase in sorbent surface area which leads to an increase in active sorption sites 91 the rate constant for leca 13 99 g mg min is almost one fourth of that of silty sandy soil 56 88 g mg min which indicates that the surface area of leca was significantly higher thus leading to more sorption as monolayer sorption is prevalent the surface area plays an extremely important role in selecting the proper adsorbent these results clearly indicate that leca was the better choice of adsorbent 3 7 adsorption study in dynamic conditions and hydrus modeling 3 7 1 vertical column test standard solute transport fig 8 depicts the variation in aspect ratio c c0 over time for a vertical column of tested adsorbent containing 12 mg l of an initial carbendazim spiked constant head solution c0 the steady rise in concentrations c at the outlet location for different time intervals suggests that the experiment reached 90 saturation after roughly 30 h or 1 25 days for silty sandy soil on the other hand the equilibrium concentration was attained after 1 75 days or 42 h at which point 99 of the starting concentration could be tracked in the effluent solution indicating that the soil column had been exhausted in the case of leca the breakthrough was achieved in around 8 5 days possibly due to the use of a 200 mm deep bed very high hydraulic conductivity and good adsorptive capacity of leca the efficiency shown by hydrus closely corroborates the experimental results it was transpired from batch and column test results that leca had higher efficiency than silty sandy soil for imparting the attenuating effect on carbendazim so it was decided to use leca as bed material in a constructed wetland 3 7 2 constructed wetland cw2d fig 9 exhibits the effluent concentration of carbendazim with respect to elapsed time in both cases of laboratory scale constructed wetland and numerical modelling using hydrus the experiment was initially conducted with the solution ph maintained at phzpc of leca the maximum and minimum effluent carbendazim concentrations in a constructed wetland without vegetation were 2 04 mg l and 0 9 mg l respectively with removal efficiencies ranging from 83 to 92 5 however this was still higher than the maximum permissible residual limit set by indian standard drinking water guidelines 190 μg l so additional measures were incorporated to enhance the removal efficiencies the ph of the influent solution was reduced to highly acidic conditions which yielded even further enhancement in maximum removal efficiency upto 99 56 thereby limiting the effluent concentration to 52 8 μg l which was within the permissible limit since leca is devoid of organic matter it encourages the adsorption of protonated carbendazim resulting in higher removal efficiency under acidic conditions 3 7 3 inclusion of chrysopogon zizanioides root water uptake in a real world scenario a strong acidic ph wetland would not always be favorable especially when vegetation is considered a part of it though chrysopogon zizanioides is known to survive and flourish in strong acidic ph 37 that may not be possible in the case of other wetland plants also for practical applications of wetlands a mixture of a wide variety of contaminants would come as inflow not carbendazim alone an acidic ph helps this pesticide laden wastewater retain effectively but that might not be the case for other contaminants thus to restrict the effluent concentration within the permissible limit the inclusion of phytoremediation with the help of chrysopogon zizanioides was also considered an alternative in highly acidic ph wetlands the experiment in the vegetated bed was conducted the same way after the vetiver roots almost reached the bottom of the tank so that the root uptake effect could be well understood in the vegetated bed the maximum and minimum effluent concentrations of carbendazim observed were 0 48 mg l and 0 048 mg l respectively thus making the effective removal efficiency between 96 and 99 6 as shown in fig 10 the inclusion of macrophytes further boosted the aqueous carbendazim removal with the root water uptake proving to be a vital auxiliary mechanism apart from adsorption by leca the movement of pesticides through soil can occur by two processes mass flow and diffusion the migration mechanism of carbendazim in the constructed wetland was simulated through the hydrus cw2d module the input parameters include the physicochemical properties of leca and adsorption isotherm and kinetic coefficients obtained from batch adsorption experiments all the dimensions of the wetland tank were kept identical to the laboratory setups figs 9 and 10 thus compare the concentration of the bottom most exit point of the laboratory scale and the hydrus modelled wetland system the effluent concentrations from the laboratory scale test results were shifted slightly upwards in the above data indicating that less adsorption would be obtained at a given period this is clear because hydrus optimizes removal efficiency by considering the most favorable flow and surrounding ambient circumstances as a result the hydrus predicted findings yielded a lower exit concentration 3 8 recyclability the recyclability of the leca sand mix wetland model was tested in the present study to understand the stability and cost effectiveness of adsorbents it is essential to evaluate the recyclability of a material in real world applications this test is crucial since it illustrates how well the project can be scaled up to design a sizable artificial wetland the test measures the exhaustion time of the setup the setup used in this case was similar to the one dimensional vertical flow column study setup a column of 60 mm diameter was packed with leca and sand up to a height of 200 mm just like in the wetland since there was no retention period in this case the cycles were repeated as soon as the entire amount of solution had drained to the bottom each cycle from the initial instant of pouring to the last moment of draining took a mere 5 min on average the data of every 15 cycles were recorded up to 210 cycles on this system 100 carbendazim removal was achieved after that the efficiency dipped to 76 at the 255th cycle following that a consistent fall in removal efficiency was noted for the following 45 cycles dropping to its lowest level at 16 at the 300th cycle fig 11 3 9 environmental implication carbendazim is a possible human carcinogen this low cost strategy for keeping carbendazim laden wastewater from entering the environment has only been studied in the laboratory however the exceptional record of leca in efficiently adsorbing carbendazim from aqueous solutions suggests that it might be useful in field scale constructed wetland systems the long term advantage of this solution is that this simplistic approach requires little expertise for setup and maintenance thus attracting government organizations pharmaceutical industries and rural communities to implement this effective technique for removal of carbendazim and other organic contaminants from wastewater to prevent them from entering surface and groundwater bodies 4 conclusions an investigation was carried out to determine how to mitigate contamination in groundwater due to carbendazim laden wastewater originating from various industries and agricultural fields lightweight expanded clay aggregate leca and silty sandy soil were proposed to be used as bed materials in a wetland system in this study to lessen the problem of carbendazim contamination the optimal removal efficiency in the laboratory scale batch test was around 70 for leca compared to 55 for silty sandy soil a constant increase in temperature and highly acidic ph proved to be favorable conditions for carbendazim sorption the adsorption isotherm langmuir model for leca had a high coefficient of determination r2 0 99 and low isotherm coefficient kl 0 4587 l mg and silty sandy soil had a coefficient of determination r2 0 993 and isotherm coefficient kl 0 621 l mg which indicated that leca had reasonable and better adsorption capacity compared to silty sandy soil for reducing the concentration of carbendazim in wastewater the pseudo second order type of kinetics was observed to be the best fit for both cases vertical column tests on silty sandy soil revealed that 90 of the breakthrough was accomplished in 1 25 days for a 30 mm soil column compared to 8 5 days for a 200 mm leca column which exhibited that leca had a higher adsorbing capacity within a short time frame for carbendazim the removal efficiency of carbendazim for leca in the laboratory scale constructed wetland was about 92 which was consistent with the results of the vertical column test however further improvement of removal efficiency was achieved using chrysopogon zizanioides vetiver upto 99 6 and lowering the ph of the influent contaminant solution upto 99 56 to highly acidic conditions similar results from hydrus predicted models justified the outcome well in each case it can therefore be concluded that leca either in an acidic environment or in normal conditions combined with chrysopogon zizanioides is an outstanding economically viable adsorbent for the treatment of carbendazim laden wastewater from various sources in a lesser time period in a vertical surface flow constructed wetland declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

12767,indiscriminate disposal of hazardous waste into land generates harmful effects in the lithosphere carbendazim is widely used to prevent fungal diseases in agricultural fields and industries such as paper leather and paint in an uncontrolled manner and is reported as a possible human carcinogen when consumed therefore it is urgently needed to find effective methods to remove carbendazim from wastewater in this investigation lightweight expanded clay aggregate leca and silty sand have been explored as alternating bed materials in a constructed wetland with chrysopogon zizanioides for phytoremediation to attenuate carbendazim from wastewater the hydraulic conductivity of the soil and leca were found as 1 63 10 7 m s and 1 12 10 3 m s respectively batch adsorption test data exhibited that langmuir and pseudo second order were the best fitting isotherm and kinetic models in both cases with regression coefficient r2 values of 0 99 for all also leca had a high adsorptive capacity for the depletion of carbendazim constructed wetland study with leca and phytoremediation using chrysopogon zizanioides yielded maximum removal efficiency of carbendazim in the range of 96 99 6 which corroborated closely with the results from the hydrus model results demonstrate the combined efficacious use of leca and chrysopogon zizanioides to abate carbendazim from wastewater which can be recommended as a cost effective solution for its field scale applications graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords carbendazim fungicide constructed wetland isotherm and kinetics hydrus data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction pesticide is a substance used to control the population of insects weeds fungi and all sorts of harmful pests almost 40 of agricultural products are lost worldwide due to plant diseases and pest attacks pesticides help control all these damages and significantly increase crop production 1 despite their beneficial application pesticides have detrimental effects on the environment with lingering action on humans and other animals 2 carbendazim methyl benzimidazole 2 yl carbamate mbc is a systematic broad spectrum fungicide that belongs to the benzimidazole class and is a 2 aminobenzimidazole with a methoxycarbonyl group substituting for the primary amino group carbendazim is widely used in india to control fungal diseases in several vegetables fruits medicinal herbs ornamental plants and turf grasses 3 4 and also in paper leather textile and paint industries 5 carbendazim is persistent due to its benzimidazole ring which is difficult to break 6 7 the slow degradation of this compound and bioaccumulation adversely affect humans other mammalian species and microorganisms carbendazim is a possible human carcinogen and high doses of it influence the hypothalamus pituitary gonad axis thereby damaging the testicles of animals and causing infertility 8 9 according to singh et al 10 carbendazim not only messes with the microbial community structure in ecosystems but also induces aneugenic and mutagenic effects and causes apoptosis hepatocellular dysfunction disruption of hematological functions teratogenicity mitotic spindle abnormalities and embryo toxicity as per the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac the health value for carbendazim in drinking water in australia is 0 1 mg l where health values are calculated from the average daily intake usually 10 for a 70 kg adult consuming 2 l of water per day 11 according to is 10500 2012 12 the maximum pesticide residue level in drinking water is 190 μg l without any exemptions however the widespread usage of carbendazim in forestry and agriculture paves the entry of this contaminant into the aquatic systems where concentrations as high as 4 5 mg l were found 10 which is well over the permissible limit this is of alarming concern in developing countries like india where a considerable population relies on these aquatic systems only for drinking water thus inviting the pesticides into their bodies leading to health complications hence proper usage of effective methods for removing carbendazim from surface water and wastewater is a vital issue that needs addressing to protect human health researchers have adopted various techniques to remediate carbendazim and other pesticides from wastewater advanced oxidation process aop in the presence of h2o2 tio2 and uv 13 15 bio stimulation and bio catalysis 16 photocatalytic treatment 17 phytoremediation combined with the presence of carbendazim degrading bacterial strains such as bacillus subtilis paracoccus sp flavobacterium sp and pseudomonas sp 18 20 and adsorption through solid adsorbents like bentonite silica montmorillonite and activated charcoal 21 25 are some of the treatment techniques which have been applied several artificially manufactured adsorbents including graphene oxide metal organic frameworks and activated carbon 26 27 as well as naturally occurring adsorbents including agricultural residues zeolites and clay minerals 28 29 have been recognized for attenuation of carbendazim synthetic sorbents are excessively expensive limiting their use to laboratory investigations only and preventing widespread application in the field as a result adsorbents like zeolite cork kaolinite and lightweight expanded clay aggregate leca with an exceptional specific surface area and outstanding compound stability have recently become the focus as the choice of bed materials in constructed wetland and have piqued the interest of researchers 30 33 keeping all of these in view the present study is focused on the development of a cost effective wastewater treatment system in the form of an artificially constructed wetland using silty sandy soil 34 or leca 35 as primary bed material with the inclusion of chrysopogon zizanioides as major macrophyte to treat carbendazim laden wastewater silty sandy soil and leca have been previously proved as excellent adsorbents for organic contaminants with removal efficiencies reaching as high as 97 30 34 vetiver is a perennial bunchgrass of the family poaceae that grows up to 1 5 m in height under favorable conditions and has a typical downward growing root system 36 this species has been employed for soil erosion resistance oil extraction and fodder vetiver can sustain a wide range of ph and grow in various soils 37 vetiver is also vividly used for contaminant remediation and has proved to be successful in the removal of a wide variety of organic contaminants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pesticides antibiotics and heavy metals 38 44 several researchers have also reported the excellent potential of chrysopogon zizanioides while used in constructed wetlands for effective removal of a wide variety of contaminants ranging from domestic wastewater to heavy metals poly aromatic hydrocarbons and antibiotics 45 50 however the efficiency of silty sandy soil leca and vetiver alone or in combination have not been examined for abatement of carbendazim pollution using constructed wetlands in the present study the physicochemical properties of soil and leca were determined as per the guidelines depicted in the bureau of indian standards 51 55 using the response surface methodology approach the effects of various significant factors like adsorbent dosage contact time and initial contaminant concentration were estimated to determine the maximum contaminant removal efficiencies under both static and dynamic adsorption processes to obtain a better adsorbent for use as bed material in a laboratory scale constructed wetland setup additionally the kinetics and isotherm of carbendazim adsorption by the soil and leca were evaluated which provided the necessary information related to the adsorption capacity of the two materials further to influence the choice of geo media for wetland beds finally the findings of the experimental results were verified using the hydrus software package which effectively simulates the fate and transport of contaminants in porous media 56 the scope adopted in the investigation is believed to highlight the adsorptive behavior of aqueous carbendazim in geo media and the potential of the mitigating processes planned in this context to address societal health problems 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials sorbent hydraulic conductivity plays a crucial role in wetlands and must be considered when selecting a wetland site according to usepa 625 1 88 022 1998 the ideal range is from 10 4 to 10 5 cm s 34 the silty sand used in potato fields was obtained from the durgapur barrage area west bengal india 34 leca was procured from suyog plastics a commercial firm based in gujarat india leca is made by heating clay materials to roughly 1300 c 57 due to the evaporation of pore water and other organic compounds and the addition of expansion agents such as sawdust clay expands fast during this process leca comprises pellets varying in size from 1 to 32 mm in diameter with an average bulk density of 400 600 kg m3 it has a honeycomb interior and a smooth ceramic like exterior layer 58 59 the present study used leca pellets ranging from 5 to 8 mm chrysopogon zizanioides used in the present study were purchased from a local nursery in durgapur india 100 pure carbendazim was used in the study procured from cdh chemicals india all aqueous solutions of carbendazim were prepared using deionized water mixed with 2 ethanol the soil was collected using the auger boring method and stored in sterilized bags to avoid contamination leca was first washed under running water and then oven dried to remove suspended solid particulates 2 2 quality assurance and quality control all analyses were done in triplicates with the average value calculated from there within a 5 margin of error the maximum values were obtained those values were considered while the other values were discarded chemicals of analytical grade were used throughout a double distilled water free of ammonia was prepared in the laboratory and was used to prepare the spiked samples standard curves were monitored regularly and the calibration standards were logged in a data storage file furthermore primary qc qa objectives such as the fabrication of spiked samples reference samples and blanks for making standards standard protocols and replicates epa apha guidelines 60 were followed as precisely as possible precision accuracy and bias homogeneity were maintained all of the analytical equipment used in the inquiry was calibrated and maintained as per the instructions of the manufacturer and best practices using standard reference solutions supplied by the manufacturer or obtained from reliable sources general awareness was also employed to evade contamination of samples special measures taken during sample collection included proper capping pre cleaning and dust protection 2 3 physico chemical characterization physicochemical characterization of silty sand and leca was conducted in the laboratory under standard temperature and pressure stp conforming to the guidelines in is 2720 1983 51 55 a similar approach was also adopted by adhikary et al 34 2 4 phzpc test zero surface charge points of leca and silty sandy soil were established using the phzpc experiment the specific ph of the adsorbent at which its surface is devoid of adsorbed h3o and oh ions is known as the ph of zero point charge 150 mg of adsorbent was shaken in 50 ml of a 0 01 m sodium chloride nacl solution with a pre set ph using a bod shaker for 24 h using hcl and naoh in varying concentrations the ph was initially changed to five levels ranging from 2 to 10 afterward the samples were filtered using a vacuum filter rechecking the ph of the filtrates was done and plotting the initial ph on the horizontal axis versus ph phfinal phinitial on the vertical axis yielded the zero point charge ph 2 5 batch adsorption test and response surface methodology batch experiments were executed to assess carbendazim adsorption through soil and leca to obtain equilibrium kinetics and isotherms at first a conventional approach was made to check the equilibrium time a dose of 1 g of soil and an initial solute concentration of 12 ppm were fixed and contact time was varied from 30 min to 24 h then after getting the equilibrium time the soil dose was varied from 0 5 g up to 2 g and the initial concentration from 4 mg l to 12 mg l to check variation in adsorption the maximum concentration of carbendazim was fixed at 12 mg l after that the range of adsorbent dose time of contact and initial concentration of carbendazim were chosen accordingly design expert statistical package software has been utilized to determine experimental design using response surface methodology rsm which explores the relationships between multiple explanatory variables and one or more response variables in the conventional method single variables are optimized one after the other to check their influence on final responses but this does not allow changing all the independent factors simultaneously and observing the combined effect 61 therefore response surface methodology rsm was adopted to use parameters used in experimental design effectively the main idea of rsm is to use a sequence of designed experiments to obtain an optimal response the main advantage of using rsm is that it reduces experimental trials and evaluates the influence of different factors on a particular response 62 in contrast to conventional methods the interaction among process variables can be determined by statistical techniques the time of contact 63 64 and adsorbent dosage 34 65 are two of the most important factors considered in the rsm design along with input contaminant concentration being the third one other researchers have adopted similar concentration ranges 66 68 screening characterization robust parameter design combined designs comparative testing mixture designs and optimization are all features of design expert statistical software dedicated to performing experiment design 69 the process parameters were optimized using the box behnken model bbd for maximal carbendazim removal the bbd model offers 15 viable options accordingly adsorbent doses ranged from 10 to 40 g l time of contact was kept between 4 and 8 h and carbendazim concentrations varied from 4 to 12 mg l 67 a temperature of 25 c and a shaker speed of 150 rpm was maintained the solutions were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min before using the vacuum filtering procedure the solutions output concentration was determined using a uv visible spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 285 nm 6 67 the following two equations analyzed the removal efficiency 1 adsorbent sorption capacity qe c i c e m v 2 carbendazim removal c i c e c i 100 where ci is the input concentration of carbendazim mg l ce is the equilibrium concentration mg l v is the sample volume l m is the adsorbent mass gram qe is the amount of carbendazim adsorbed per unit mass of adsorbent mg g and r is percentage removal of carbendazim 2 6 ph variation the initial ph of the adsorption system substantially affects the adsorption of contaminants as it affects the binding nature of sorbate and the morphology of the sorbent surface 70 ph dependent sorption is significant in explaining the transport and distribution of organic compounds in adsorbent adsorbate interfaces 71 73 changes aid the deprotonation of antibiotic functional groups in ph the ability of these moieties to receive electrons is influenced by ph changes which suppresses or elevates cation π bonding and π π stacking 74 the ph was changed from 2 to 10 for this experiment using hcl and naoh solutions 2 7 temperature variation temperature also plays a vital role in the adsorption of organic contaminants on sorbents an increase in temperature decreases the viscosity of the solution thereby enhancing the rate of molecular diffusion thus it becomes easier for contaminant molecules to cross the external boundary layer and move into the internal pores of sorbents 75 76 in this study the temperature was varied from 5 c to 45 c with an interval of 10 c 2 8 isotherm studies to find the best fitting isotherm model the equilibrium concentration data from batch adsorption trials were employed in three alternative models linear langmuir 77 and freundlich 78 models 2 9 kinetic studies batch adsorption experiments provided the data for equilibrium concentrations to determine the best fit utilizing correlation data three distinct kinetic models were considered intra particle diffusion 79 pseudo second order 80 and elovich 81 the following equation was used to calculate soil sorption capacity qt at time t qt mg g 3 q t c i c e t m v where ce t is the equilibrium concentration mg l at a particular time t 2 10 one dimensional soil column experiment to evaluate the adsorption of carbendazim in soil and leca a dynamic flow through condition was created using a laboratory scale column filtering approach as depicted in fig 1 this experiment used a vertical flow one dimensional column design a perspex cylinder with a 25 mm internal diameter and height of 300 mm was used in which silty sandy soil was poured up to a height of 30 mm another test was conducted for leca using a bigger column of a diameter of 60 mm and an adsorbent height of 200 mm to get an appropriate breakthrough curve because the saturated hydraulic conductivity for leca is relatively high glass beads were placed at the top of the column to ensure an equitable solution distribution glass wool was placed at the bottom to prevent adsorbent drainage from the outlet the sorbent was placed in the column in layers up to the necessary height with 85 relative compaction to avoid clogging throughout the experiment sidewall flow is always a concern for packed columns generally caused by flexing the column walls during or after soil packing or improper packing of the columns the wall effect results in a preferential flow path which leads to spatial heterogeneity that ultimately results in significant bias in experimental results there are several approaches to negate the side wall effect sand gluing roughening of walls and installation of annular rings 82 in this study a very thin layer of sand was glued to the inner side of the columns to avoid the bias in results caused by the wall effect the concentration of carbendazim was kept at 12 mg l throughout and the leachates were collected at regular intervals from the outlet a uv visible spectrophotometer with a wavelength of 285 nm was used to measure carbendazim exit concentrations 2 11 construction of wetland the optimum removal efficiency of an adsorbent differs from the static batch condition when subjected to dynamic flow through conditions as in constructed wetland depending on the results from static batch experiments it was planned to use either silty sandy soil or leca in constructed wetland experiments four identical laboratory scale vertical surface flow created wetlands with dimensions of 520 mm 340 mm 320 mm were put up for the study as exhibited in fig 2 one wetland was scheduled to use adsorbent silty sand or leca up to a height of 200 mm chrysopogon zizanioides was planted in the other wetland two wetlands were kept as control units with only distilled water replacing the contaminant solution one wetland was without vegetation while the other one was planted a holed plate and steel wool were placed below the soil bed to prevent leaching about two months were selected in the planned setup to allow time for proper development of the root zone which was supposed to act as the principal contaminant uptake unit of the plant after the elapsed period of 2 months 12 mg l carbendazim solution was poured intermittently for 6 h cycles to test the efficacy of the wetland for adsorption 2 12 hydrus modeling hydrus includes computational finite element models for simulating single and multi dimensional heat fluid and solute transport in partially inundated porous media hydrus was used to simulate two and three dimensional numerical models in this investigation hydrus program is used to solve fick s advection dispersion equation for solute transport and richard s equation for saturated unsaturated water flow advective dispersive transport is considered in the liquid phase while diffusion for the gaseous phase the controlling flow and transport equations are numerically solved using the galerkin type linear finite element techniques 2 12 1 standard solute transport the software replicated the experimental column studies using a conventional solute transport model to verify the laboratory results the numerical model was built using the same data set as the column experiments 34 2 12 2 constructed wetland cw2d hydrus water flow and solute transport program includes cw2d reactive transport module which was created to characterize wetland degradation processes and biochemical transformations 83 84 cw2d module takes into account thirteen different components and nine different processes it also assumes a constant concentration of microorganisms in each finite element the flow equation includes a sink term to account for water uptake by plant roots according to dittmer et al 85 hydrus plant uptake models which describe nutrient and water uptake could be used to simulate plant uptake in massive loaded systems the simulation findings for low strength wastewater show that these models overemphasize potential nutrient uptake the present study simulated the experimental laboratory scale wetland using a cw2d module the pesticide was introduced as slowly biodegradable organic matter and the model was run continuously for 24 h with sporadic contaminant loading every 6 h the above models employed data from batch adsorption isotherm and kinetic investigations as input parameters 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of adsorbent a potentially effective adsorbent must have a high affinity for adsorption porosity and specific surface area reversibility becomes an important criterion as the recovery of the adsorbent is needed in case of costly synthetically manufactured adsorbents physicochemical characterization of leca and silty sandy soil has been shown in table 1 3 2 zero point charge the effect of surface functionality on pesticide adsorption may be complicated by the charge characteristics of the adsorbent surface henceforth all experiments were performed using these adsorbents by keeping ph equal to their respective phzpc values the zero point charge ph of soil and leca were determined and the results are shown in fig 3 the surface of the adsorbent is positively charged if the ph is lesser than the phzpc value and negatively charged if the ph is greater than phzpc it can be observed from the figure that for leca the zero point is shifted towards the right with a phzpc value of around 8 as compared to silty sandy soil which has a phzpc value of about 7 this shifting of phzpc towards the alkaline region indicates that initially the surface had abundant negative charges which is true for leca as it contained more clay particles than silty sandy soil and the clay surface had negative charges 3 3 batch adsorption results laboratory scale batch tests were conducted to simulate the static non flow through system that provides the adsorption capacity of the sorbents using the conventional method it was found that maximum adsorption occurred at around 4 h after that the increasing time did not have any significant changes in adsorption as the effluent concentration was constant for up to 8 h the effluent concentration increased after that which might be due to desorption bbd produced 15 trial runs with different combinations of input parameters to optimize the removal efficiency the results produced by these batch tests are shown in table 2 among other models design expert suggested the best fitting for the mentioned cases through anova analysis tabulated in table 3 the two most important parameters to judge the efficacy of a model are fisher s f value and probability p value the higher f value indicates more accuracy of the model in predicting the outcomes and the p value should be 0 05 it can be seen from table 3 that in the case of silty sandy soil the initial contaminant concentration c c2 alone and in combination with sorbent dosage and contact time ac bc b2 is a significant parameter controlling removal efficiency whereas in the case of leca all the three input parameters are deemed significant on their own a b c and in combination ab ac bc c2 the contribution of initial contaminant concentration in the whole system is one of the most crucial aspects driving the results as intra parametric quadratic reactions are also deemed significant for both the adsorbents this implies that the whole adsorption system heavily depends on initial carbendazim concentration the results also define that the choice of parameters and the range of values are more appropriate for leca than silty sandy soil this signifies that interaction between input parameters is much more in the case of leca which might be a reason for more adsorption of carbendazim using leca compared to silty sandy soil fit statistics table 4 show that the quadratic model best fits soil and leca with a difference between adjusted and predicted r2 values of 0 2 34 anova analysis has shown overall model was significant in both cases with a p value of 0 0014 and 0 0002 and f values of 23 59 and 52 61 for soil and leca respectively the model f value for leca was more than twice that of silty sandy soil which indicates that in the given input parameter conditions leca was a more potential candidate than silty sandy soil for the adsorption of carbendazim from wastewater the increase in sample size increases the r2 value significantly and the adjusted r2 nullifies the effect of sample size and if the difference is 0 2 then it can be stated that the sample size does have little or no significance in this present study removal efficiencies of soil and leca as final responses were obtained from rsm results eqs 4 and 5 are presented in terms of actual factors explaining how closely the intra variable and inter variable interactions affect the adsorption process positive and negative factors indicate favorable and adverse effects respectively 4 removal efficiency of soil 54 09 1 26 soil dose 6 96 contact time 6 71 initial conc 0 062198 soil dose contact time 0 13 soil

leca dose contact time 0 04 leca dose initial conc 0 42 contact time initial conc 0 01 leca dose 2 0 85 contact time 2 0 69 initial conc 2 the given levels for each factor specified in the original units of those factors can be predicted using the actual factor equations for both equations the intercept is non zero which states that the intercept is not at the center of the design space defining the mean of the input parameter conditions thus these equations must not be used to determine the relative impact of each factor the intercept of the leca eq 14 04 is much closer to the center in compared to the soil eq 54 09 indicating that in the case of the second design the deviation of the design function is less at the center due to the presence of more data points there this indicates that small errors occur near the design points and moderate errors are experienced near the design center and at the design perimeter designs with points that are pushed closer to the center of the design afford considerably more protection against bias errors 86 in this study the targeted optimal removal efficiency parameter condition was kept to be at best economically viable condition by keeping adsorbent dosage 10 g l and contact time 4 h as minimum and carbendazim concentration 12 mg l as maximum which deviates from the mean parametric values viz dosage of 25 g l a contact time of 6 h and initial concentration of 8 mg l so that the error occurring is negligible negative and positive coefficients define the opposing and favorable effects of carbendazim removal when the concentration of a factor is raised the reaction gets better however the response doesn t get better when the factor has a negative effect 87 according to the above equations contact time and initial concentration influenced adsorption in both cases the adsorbent dose had a negative effect in the case of soil but not in the case of leca this contrasting nature of soil and leca in terms of dosage could have been caused by the limited adsorption sites in silty sandy soil compared to a more significant number of sites present in leca the comparative high adsorption capacity of leca also being indicative of this ramp plots fig 4 and contour plots fig 5 indicate optimized results for soil and leca after triplicating the experiments an average removal value of 57 and 70 were obtained for soil and leca respectively from the batch study at optimum conditions leca showed higher efficiency in adsorbing carbendazim than silty sandy soil so leca was taken as the main adsorbent in the cw bed 3 4 effect of ph fig 6 demonstrates the variation of adsorptive capacities of the studied sorbents with changes in ph it is observed that with the change in ph from the acidic to the alkaline range the adsorption decreased for both the sorbents while for silty sandy soil the change in adsorption was gradual leca showed more steep variation in both the cases highly acidic conditions provided the best results which might be due to the fact that in acidic ph carbendazim is adsorbed by the clay fraction of the sorbents and leca had more clay content than silty sandy soil which resulted in higher adsorption the change in ph from neutral to alkaline region did not show any drastic changes in adsorption this leads to the conclusion that due to protonation carbendazim was predominantly adsorbed by the minerals rather than neutral molecules generally adsorbed by organic matter which was negligible for both sorbents similar results were obtained by paszko 88 according to li et al 76 the adsorption of ionizable organic compounds is ph dependent due to the presence of varied species which strongly affects solubility this phenomenon is also due to the π π electron donor acceptor interaction which is one of the significant forces for the adsorption of organic compounds containing benzene rings 3 5 effect of temperature the influence of temperature on antibiotic adsorption was investigated by varying the temperature from 5 c to 45 c in 10 c intervals the adsorption of carbendazim was shown to increase with the increment in temperature fig 7 a steeper change is observed for leca than in silty sandy soil which might be due to more clay particles in leca this improvement in adsorption with temperature increase may be caused by either a rise in the number of binding sites on the soil or a surge in their affinity for carbendazim the carbendazim solvent system is temperature sensitive and when the temperature goes up carbendazim becomes less hydrophilic and more compact which increases surface activity and hence physical adsorption capacity of both the adsorbents also a rise in temperature of the system increases protonated fraction of carbendazim which was much more readily adsorbed than the molecular fraction a similar observation was stated by li et al 89 3 6 adsorption isotherm and kinetics the adsorption isotherm for soil and leca was evaluated by varying the initial concentration of carbendazim from 2 to 12 mg l keeping a constant adsorbent dose of 0 5 g and constant contact time of 4 h langmuir model provided the best fit in both cases as shown in table 5 which indicates strong monolayer adsorption of carbendazim on both sorbents the results show the adsorption capacity of leca 1 2657 mg g to be more than twice that of silty sandy soil 0 5009 mg g which might be due to more clay content in leca thus generating more active sites for sorption also the fact that negatively charged clay particles generally help to bind the protonated form of carbendazim resulting in a stronger bond between leca and carbendazim compared to silty sandy soil adsorption kinetics is mainly assessed to determine the rate of contaminant uptake through adsorbent with respect to time at a constant adsorbent and adsorbate dose it also determines the adsorption process duration and helps find the equilibrium time 34 90 among different kinetics models studied pseudo second order was found well fitted for both adsorbents as shown in table 5 it is termed pseudo because the equation is based on the amount of adsorbed material on the adsorbent instead of the concentration in the liquid the pseudo second order rate constant tends to decrease with the increase in sorbent surface area which leads to an increase in active sorption sites 91 the rate constant for leca 13 99 g mg min is almost one fourth of that of silty sandy soil 56 88 g mg min which indicates that the surface area of leca was significantly higher thus leading to more sorption as monolayer sorption is prevalent the surface area plays an extremely important role in selecting the proper adsorbent these results clearly indicate that leca was the better choice of adsorbent 3 7 adsorption study in dynamic conditions and hydrus modeling 3 7 1 vertical column test standard solute transport fig 8 depicts the variation in aspect ratio c c0 over time for a vertical column of tested adsorbent containing 12 mg l of an initial carbendazim spiked constant head solution c0 the steady rise in concentrations c at the outlet location for different time intervals suggests that the experiment reached 90 saturation after roughly 30 h or 1 25 days for silty sandy soil on the other hand the equilibrium concentration was attained after 1 75 days or 42 h at which point 99 of the starting concentration could be tracked in the effluent solution indicating that the soil column had been exhausted in the case of leca the breakthrough was achieved in around 8 5 days possibly due to the use of a 200 mm deep bed very high hydraulic conductivity and good adsorptive capacity of leca the efficiency shown by hydrus closely corroborates the experimental results it was transpired from batch and column test results that leca had higher efficiency than silty sandy soil for imparting the attenuating effect on carbendazim so it was decided to use leca as bed material in a constructed wetland 3 7 2 constructed wetland cw2d fig 9 exhibits the effluent concentration of carbendazim with respect to elapsed time in both cases of laboratory scale constructed wetland and numerical modelling using hydrus the experiment was initially conducted with the solution ph maintained at phzpc of leca the maximum and minimum effluent carbendazim concentrations in a constructed wetland without vegetation were 2 04 mg l and 0 9 mg l respectively with removal efficiencies ranging from 83 to 92 5 however this was still higher than the maximum permissible residual limit set by indian standard drinking water guidelines 190 μg l so additional measures were incorporated to enhance the removal efficiencies the ph of the influent solution was reduced to highly acidic conditions which yielded even further enhancement in maximum removal efficiency upto 99 56 thereby limiting the effluent concentration to 52 8 μg l which was within the permissible limit since leca is devoid of organic matter it encourages the adsorption of protonated carbendazim resulting in higher removal efficiency under acidic conditions 3 7 3 inclusion of chrysopogon zizanioides root water uptake in a real world scenario a strong acidic ph wetland would not always be favorable especially when vegetation is considered a part of it though chrysopogon zizanioides is known to survive and flourish in strong acidic ph 37 that may not be possible in the case of other wetland plants also for practical applications of wetlands a mixture of a wide variety of contaminants would come as inflow not carbendazim alone an acidic ph helps this pesticide laden wastewater retain effectively but that might not be the case for other contaminants thus to restrict the effluent concentration within the permissible limit the inclusion of phytoremediation with the help of chrysopogon zizanioides was also considered an alternative in highly acidic ph wetlands the experiment in the vegetated bed was conducted the same way after the vetiver roots almost reached the bottom of the tank so that the root uptake effect could be well understood in the vegetated bed the maximum and minimum effluent concentrations of carbendazim observed were 0 48 mg l and 0 048 mg l respectively thus making the effective removal efficiency between 96 and 99 6 as shown in fig 10 the inclusion of macrophytes further boosted the aqueous carbendazim removal with the root water uptake proving to be a vital auxiliary mechanism apart from adsorption by leca the movement of pesticides through soil can occur by two processes mass flow and diffusion the migration mechanism of carbendazim in the constructed wetland was simulated through the hydrus cw2d module the input parameters include the physicochemical properties of leca and adsorption isotherm and kinetic coefficients obtained from batch adsorption experiments all the dimensions of the wetland tank were kept identical to the laboratory setups figs 9 and 10 thus compare the concentration of the bottom most exit point of the laboratory scale and the hydrus modelled wetland system the effluent concentrations from the laboratory scale test results were shifted slightly upwards in the above data indicating that less adsorption would be obtained at a given period this is clear because hydrus optimizes removal efficiency by considering the most favorable flow and surrounding ambient circumstances as a result the hydrus predicted findings yielded a lower exit concentration 3 8 recyclability the recyclability of the leca sand mix wetland model was tested in the present study to understand the stability and cost effectiveness of adsorbents it is essential to evaluate the recyclability of a material in real world applications this test is crucial since it illustrates how well the project can be scaled up to design a sizable artificial wetland the test measures the exhaustion time of the setup the setup used in this case was similar to the one dimensional vertical flow column study setup a column of 60 mm diameter was packed with leca and sand up to a height of 200 mm just like in the wetland since there was no retention period in this case the cycles were repeated as soon as the entire amount of solution had drained to the bottom each cycle from the initial instant of pouring to the last moment of draining took a mere 5 min on average the data of every 15 cycles were recorded up to 210 cycles on this system 100 carbendazim removal was achieved after that the efficiency dipped to 76 at the 255th cycle following that a consistent fall in removal efficiency was noted for the following 45 cycles dropping to its lowest level at 16 at the 300th cycle fig 11 3 9 environmental implication carbendazim is a possible human carcinogen this low cost strategy for keeping carbendazim laden wastewater from entering the environment has only been studied in the laboratory however the exceptional record of leca in efficiently adsorbing carbendazim from aqueous solutions suggests that it might be useful in field scale constructed wetland systems the long term advantage of this solution is that this simplistic approach requires little expertise for setup and maintenance thus attracting government organizations pharmaceutical industries and rural communities to implement this effective technique for removal of carbendazim and other organic contaminants from wastewater to prevent them from entering surface and groundwater bodies 4 conclusions an investigation was carried out to determine how to mitigate contamination in groundwater due to carbendazim laden wastewater originating from various industries and agricultural fields lightweight expanded clay aggregate leca and silty sandy soil were proposed to be used as bed materials in a wetland system in this study to lessen the problem of carbendazim contamination the optimal removal efficiency in the laboratory scale batch test was around 70 for leca compared to 55 for silty sandy soil a constant increase in temperature and highly acidic ph proved to be favorable conditions for carbendazim sorption the adsorption isotherm langmuir model for leca had a high coefficient of determination r2 0 99 and low isotherm coefficient kl 0 4587 l mg and silty sandy soil had a coefficient of determination r2 0 993 and isotherm coefficient kl 0 621 l mg which indicated that leca had reasonable and better adsorption capacity compared to silty sandy soil for reducing the concentration of carbendazim in wastewater the pseudo second order type of kinetics was observed to be the best fit for both cases vertical column tests on silty sandy soil revealed that 90 of the breakthrough was accomplished in 1 25 days for a 30 mm soil column compared to 8 5 days for a 200 mm leca column which exhibited that leca had a higher adsorbing capacity within a short time frame for carbendazim the removal efficiency of carbendazim for leca in the laboratory scale constructed wetland was about 92 which was consistent with the results of the vertical column test however further improvement of removal efficiency was achieved using chrysopogon zizanioides vetiver upto 99 6 and lowering the ph of the influent contaminant solution upto 99 56 to highly acidic conditions similar results from hydrus predicted models justified the outcome well in each case it can therefore be concluded that leca either in an acidic environment or in normal conditions combined with chrysopogon zizanioides is an outstanding economically viable adsorbent for the treatment of carbendazim laden wastewater from various sources in a lesser time period in a vertical surface flow constructed wetland declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

12768,the scarcity of clean and fresh water in some parts of the world which is exacerbated by man s activities either through domestic or industrial use has been an age old cause of worry printing and dyeing wastewater is the aqueous effluent released by factories that operate the dyeing and finishing of wool and silk among other things the printing and dyeing wastewater pdw contains a high concentration of dyes salts and other contaminants this study is a review of published literature that utilised various technologies for the treatment of pdw the studied technologies include adsorption membrane technology advanced oxidation processes and biological processes the strengths as well as the drawbacks of these technologies were studied it was observed that adsorption membrane technology and biological processes recorded a removal efficiency of 80 a rejection rate of 90 and an effective dye degradation rate of 96 respectively from the study it was observed that advanced oxidation processes is the most viable technique for pdw treatment due to its simplicity efficiency scalability and from the economic point of view future perspectives such as product recovery from the pdw waste stream modelling and optimisation of the printing and dyeing processes and the adoption of zero liquid and waste discharge were also presented in this study finally pdw treatment technologies should strike a balance between being environmentally friendly efficient and cost effective to achieve robust and sustainable wastewater treatment programs graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords environmental protection wastewater treatment advanced oxidation processes membrane processes biological treatment adsorption data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction water is necessary for the survival of all forms of life on earth hence it must be free of pollution 1 3 water purification is a critical topic that has recently gained a lot of attention 4 5 textile industries are a newly emerging area that is rapidly expanding due to the great pressure of global population expansion 6 7 textile businesses utilise a variety of colours that are eventually dumped into freshwater reservoirs 7 8 the textile industry s water contamination has had a negative influence on the ecosystem necessitating rapid action to remediate the dye laden wastewater the textile industry releases a large amount of wastewater through various unit operations like scouring bleaching dyeing and printing that are seen during textile making of the 1 million tons of toxic dye and ink effluents generated about 0 3 million tons are discharged without proper treatment 9 printing and dye wastewater pdw is the aqueous effluent released by factories that operate the dyeing and finishing of wool and silk among other things dyeing and finishing activities in the textile industry account for up to 20 of all wastewater discharged globally 10 total dye usage is 10 000 tons per year with roughly 100 tons entering the environment via the water supply 7 11 dyes may degrade or react with other elements in the environment during migration producing a variety of hazardous and dangerous compounds 10 these toxic compounds have teratogenic and neurotoxic effects on people who ingest polluted agricultural and fishery products in addition to harmful effects on the organisms in the ecosystem 12 13 dyes can cause respiratory irritation jaundice and vomiting at low doses organic dyes can also harm the lungs liver kidneys heart and brain over time 14 because these dyes are particularly water soluble a considerable portion of them ends up in the effluent during the dyeing process 6 7 dyes are one of the most dangerous and poisonous toxins found in a variety of industries including cosmetics 15 16 food textiles paper rubber printing and plastic 6 11 as a result it s critical to remove these toxic dyes from increasing effluents before they re released into the environment 7 17 dyes in wastewater hinder sunlight from diffusing into the water disrupting plant photosynthesis 11 18 organic dyes are among the most common types of water pollutants primarily emitted during the printing textile and paper manufacturing processes 14 19 grease and waxes 20 leather 21 textiles 22 pharmaceuticals 23 foodstuffs 24 cosmetics 25 hair 26 fur 26 plastics 27 and paper 28 as well as sensors 29 lasers 30 photography 31 optical data storage 32 paints 33 and brighteners have all applied dyes 14 azo dyes are now frequently utilised owing to their high jet blacks lack of dust high solubility and other benefits 34 their annual consumption accounts for almost 70 of overall dye consumption unfortunately during the manufacturing and use of this product a large amount of printing and dye wastewater is created 35 the majority of organic contaminants found in dyeing effluent are benzene derivatives which have relatively persistent chromophores 34 acidic basic cationic direct and reactive anionic dyes as well as diffused non ionic dyes have been classified based on their charge in an aqueous solution 36 formazan anthraquinone phthalocyanine oxazine and azo are examples of reactive anionic dyes that are grouped into several classes based on their molecular structure 34 reactive dyes have been widely used in the textile industry due to their strong water solubility and affinity for binding with textile fibres 14 15 in many countries treating textile dye wastewater before releasing it into bodies of water has become normal policy and is heavily enforced 14 15 as a result developing improved and cost effective technologies for the remediation of pdw has piqued environmentalists interest 37 another major consideration is the cost of dye clean up technologies 38 when considering cost effectiveness a dye removal procedure should be capable of removing dye quickly without causing additional pollution 38 39 printing effluent contains azo dye and is not only generated from textile making it is also produced from plastic printing and cardboard lithography printing effluents are very difficult kinds of effluents to work with they are made of non biodegradable compounds and mostly carry a significant amount of hg and cd 40 on the other hand dye effluents contain mostly organic moieties like ketones aldehydes amino nitro sulphur and conjugated chromophores which are not as hard to handle as ink effluent 41 presently three types of treatment techniques are used to treat dyes in pdw which include physical treatment adsorption 42 membrane separation 43 44 and coagulation flocculation 45 chemical treatment chemical oxidation 46 photocatalytic oxidation 47 and electrochemistry and biological treatment anaerobic treatment aerobic treatment and anaerobic aerobic combined treatment 37 48 various researchers have reviewed the concept of the treatment of pdw xu et al 49 published a mini review on the subject matter they summarized the recent progress of anaerobic based textile wastewater treatment systems such as up flow anaerobic sludge blanket expanded granular sludge bed anaerobic baffled reactor anaerobic membrane bioreactors and hybrid systems the working principles characteristics and treatment performance for each system are summarized in their work among several available processing technologies the anaerobic technology has attracted more interest in recent decades due to environmental concerns and regulations and the continuous rising of wastewater discharge standards and industry standards it was suggested that there is a pressing need to develop affordable and effective treatment techniques for textile printing and dyeing wastewater zhongchuang 39 reviewed the use of plant biomass carbon as an adsorbent for the treatment of pdw their study summarizes current literature discussing the preparation method and physicochemical characteristics of pbc prepared from different plant species the effect of plant biomass carbon pbc on the removal of different dyes influencing factors affecting the removal and relevant adsorption models using plant biomass carbon for the adsorption of dyes was a feasible and economical technology this study was limited based on the focus being on the treatment of dyes alone as well as the choice of adsorbent as other non plant adsorbents were not considered de aragao umbuzeiro et al 50 conducted a study on whether dyes emitted within the discharge of a dye processing plant contributed to the mutagenicity repeatedly found in the cristais river sao paulo brazil they discovered that the components of the black dye commercial product were present in the environmental samples arising from discharges at a local textile wet processing plant except for the drinking water sample analyzed contributing to the mutagenic activity detected in the same samples the conventional treatment employed by the drinking water treatment plant seemed efficient for removing dyes and fluorescent compounds because they were not detected in the drinking water samples but in the sludge extracts because the discharge of the azo dye processing plant analyzed in their study seems to be indirectly affecting the quality of the drinking water mutagenic dyes and possibly other genotoxic substances present in the effluent should be better characterized toxicologically before being released into the aquatic environment in areas where water is taken for human consumption studies by al tohamy et al 51 and samsami et al 52 reviewed the various technologies for the remediation of dye contaminated wastewater detailed knowledge on the adverse impacts of dye containing textile wastewater on natural ecosystems and living organisms along with the various existing and advanced treatment approaches for the better management of textile wastewater towards environmental safety were studied by al tohamy et al 51 their findings show that a wide range of toxic xenobiotics is found at high concentrations in textile wastewater posing severe environmental and public health risks toxic dye containing wastewater is a significant problem because textile mills regularly discharge millions of gallons of highly polluted wastewater worldwide many traditional and emerging treatment approaches for dye containing wastewater were reported dye removal degradation from dye containing wastewater appears to be effective using physical and chemical methods a wide range of physical chemical and biological technologies for removing dyes from wastewater was reviewed by samsami et al 52 and it was evident that each of these technologies has its advantages limitations and drawbacks hybrid or integrated processes could achieve very high colour removal efficiencies and a mixture of dye containing effluents could be treated without any significant operational difficulty membrane bioreactor and photocatalytic membrane reactor technologies have proven simple reliable and cost effective at the lab and pilot scales though comprehensive these studies were limited to the removal of dyes alone based on these studies and to the best of the authors knowledge a research gap currently exists which entails research covering the entire spectrum of treatment technologies that have been employed for the treatment of pdw the purpose of this research is to examine the currently available printing and dyeing wastewater treatment technologies this is the first study that discusses various treatment technologies that have been utilised for the treatment of pdw the recent literature on the various treatment technologies for the pdw is summarized in this review it is the first study of its kind to look at how different technologies might be used to improve pdw treatment efficiency the study also discusses the inadequacies of present technologies as well as the direction of future research in depth knowledge and understanding of these pdw treatment technologies are expected to be gained from this study 2 a brief description of the printing and dyeing industrial process most textile materials are offered value added treatments through dying and printing processes the infiltration of dye into a fiber configuration and the overall interaction between a dye and a fiber is called the dyeing process generally adsorption involves dyes transfer from the aqueous solution onto the surface of the fiber and diffusion dyes permeating all through the fiber are the technical procedures of dyeing 53 in the traditional dyeing process known as a black box the amount of dye on the fabric cannot be determined until the completion of the dyeing however computational and spectrophotometry advances have made beer s law more practical this allows the amount of dye on fabric to be deduced indirectly during the dyeing process 54 printing on the other hand can be viewed from colouration perspective as creating a resplendent pattern on fabric by using different colours to partially dye the fabric 53 given the complication of the dyeing or printing process as it involves different kinds of fiber fabric structure yarn dyes and dyeing technology all these influencing factors must be aptly controlled for the attainment of the desired printing or dyeing quality dyeing involves the use of large amounts of water and hence great importance should be attributed to the quality of water to be used for dyeing and printing it must meet such requirements as being colourless without any suspended solid and having a ph range of 6 5 7 5 53 the final textile materials are as a result of the fibres produced by the dye industry which are further converted into yarn these materials are produced using a stepwise series of wet processing 55 to get rid of certain undesirable dyeing defects such as dye precipitation unevenness chalking shade dulling or harsh handle the water should generally be purified of significant impact on the dyeing quality is the preparation and pretreatment of fabric structures which can make the dying quality better controlled and predictable 53 the dyeing process could be analyzed and controlled by introducing the principles of a dye bath monitoring technology this can assist to troubleshoot root causes in shade replicability that can emanate from variableness in dye potency the fabric or the dyeing process 54 the procedure of textile colouring permits unsettled dye to get washed out with the water in comparison with the wet procedure the dry procedure generates huge amounts of solid waste importantly several types of pollutants such as dyes crude oil hydrocarbons metals etc are associated with the industrial procedure 55 industrial manufacturing procedure involves basic industrial processing steps as concisely elucidated below 2 1 sizing and desizing as an important procedure sizing aids to further strengthen the yarn reduce its breakage and also to scale its resistance sizing plays the role of a coating or defensive wall to modify the complexion of components 56 environmental compatibility fabric types treatments of effluent easy removal cost effective etc are factors to be considered in selecting sizing agents natural elements like starch protein based starch cellulose by products etc constitute most sizing agents while other synthetic agents like polyesters polyacrylates acrylic resins etc are also notable constituents 57 desizing is the reverse of sizing which is a process aimed at removing completely the sizing agent from textile fabrics and also to make the fabric ready for further processing mostly employed are starch and its other derivatives due to their widespread availability very affordable cost and their excellent ability to form film enzyme desizing oxidative desizing removing water soluble sizes or acid desizing are the most commonly used desizing techniques for the completion of this procedure 58 2 2 scouring scouring is a chemical washing procedure which is used to expunge impurities like waxes fatty acids natural oils surfactants from fibres methods such as ice scour bridge scour tidal scour and hydrodynamic scour are commonly used 57 59 by products of scouring process are compounds released during scouring like naoh fats oils detergents surfactants wax spent solvents ethoxylates and alkylphenol 60 2 3 bleaching this process involves the removal of unwanted dye or colour from fibres different chemicals like hydrogen peroxide chlorine hypochlorite sodium hypochlorite and peracetic acid are often used while different chemicals have inherent disadvantages on the quality of yarn peracetic acid poses lesser defects to yarn and elevated sheen and hence more advantageous the fabrics creamy look is usually characteristic of the natural colour substance the phases of the bleaching process give off caustic soda hydrogen peroxide hypochlorite acids chlorine etc 55 2 4 mercerisation the process of improving the fiber strength dye affinity shrink age resistance and gloss of the yarn fabric through a treatment procedure involving the use of strong alkaline 19 23 by weight of naoh solution is called mercerisation 61 double or triple mercerisation is equally possible for higher end fabrics mercerisation increases the ph of wastewater while also releasing zncl2 cyclohexanols and caustic soda through the mercerising phase 55 62 2 5 dyeing and printing the colouration of fabric and dye treatment constitutes the dyeing process for an efficient dyeing procedure adequate attention should be paid to dwell time feed rate and temperature both dyeing and printing processes have characteristic waste materials as effluents reducing agents such as surfactants acetic acids dyestuff soap etc are released in wastewater due to the dyeing step 63 64 2 6 finishing the finishing process is the last phase of textile manufacturing it converts woven or finely knitted material into its desired useful purpose with high quality and other desirable properties like glibness waterproofing and final lustre this last procedure also partakes in the pollution of water 64 65 traces of starch salts tallow special finishes etc are released from the finishing process 62 2 7 effluent generation from the printing and dyeing industry with the utilization of a number of dyes chemicals and other substances by the textile industry to bestow desirable qualities on fabrics significant quantities of effluents are being produced these effluents possess undesirable qualities that are injurious to the environment if disposed without proper treatment 57 various chemical based processes are practised in numerous industries ranging from initial sizing to final washing that have hazardous environmental implications as some of these agents are corrosive to equipment and the handling process 59 printing of textile and wastewater dyeing has a characteristically poor bio degradability high ph high turbidity high chrominance complex composition and is discharged in massive quantities 49 the increasing awareness of the sustainability of water resources has become an important issue many process industries contribute to high water consumption and wastewater generation problems in industrial water management include the processing of complex contaminants in wastewater selection of wastewater treatment technologies as well as water allocation limited reuse and recycling strategies 66 one of the most important stages in textile manufacturing is the dyeing process the fibres are colourated during this phase and the adsorption process between colour and fibres may be improved using various chemicals a certain amount of these chemicals and dyes constitute the effluents generated from the printing and dyeing industry 67 there are three different kinds of fibres used in textile manufacturing namely protein fibres which are dyed with lanaset dyes and acid dyes cellulose fibres are dyed using indigo dyes reactive dyes direct dyes and napthol dyes and synthetic fibres are dyed using basic dyes direct dyes and disperse dyes 62 a huge quantity of water and several chemicals are used by the printing and dyeing industry during the textile manufacturing process with 1 kg of textile being estimated to require about 200 l of water for its production applying chemicals onto the fibres and washing the finished product are the major uses of water 68 the dye effluents produced during this process are high in colour ph suspended solids and chemicals containing trace metals like cu cr zn and as these effluents can jeopardise the environment and human health as they can cause skin irritation dermatitis haemorrhage nausea and ulceration of skin 62 67 3 separation technologies for printing and dyeing wastewater 3 1 adsorption treatment the adsorption treatment of dye wastewater remains among the most efficient methods of removing dyes to the permissible limits and it is relatively simple user friendly and cost effective 69 70 the adsorption treatment of pdw involves the transfer of pollutants mainly dyes metal ions and anions from the aqueous solution onto the solid surface of the adsorbent here the removal of the pollutants depends on the properties of the pollutants called adsorbates the adsorbent and the aqueous solution 71 72 more so the characteristics such as the pollutants charges molecular weights structural build up concentrations contact time with adsorbents the adsorbents amount functional groups their ionised species in solution available surface for adsorption and the solutions ph and more affect adsorption 73 74 notably the reviewed articles majorly targeted pollutants such as dyes and potentially toxic elements for the adsorptive treatment of pdw this choice is partly because other parameters such as chemical oxygen demand biological oxygen demand turbidity and phosphates are readily removed by membrane filtration and other treatment technologies in addition the adsorption technology contributes to the near zero waste drive through the reuse of adsorbents 75 adsorption is a common dye treatment approach in pdw due to its ease of use excellent selectivity reduced energy consumption and lack of toxic by products 10 42 76 in particular while the adsorption approach works well for low concentration soluble dyes renewing and totally destroying organic pigments is difficult 77 78 however a variety of adsorbents are used to remove colours from industrial wastewater 77 79 80 adsorption has gained some interest because of the recoverability low cost and high efficiency of carbon based adsorbents 19 78 adsorption of dyes is more appealing since there is no disintegration or any chemical reaction of dyes and dyes can be retrieved 79 81 the adsorbent used significantly impacts the efficiency of an adsorption mechanism 81 furthermore table 1 summarizes the recent studies that utilised various adsorbents for the adsorptive treatment of simulated and real pdw moreover we discussed this treatment technology based on the following adsorbent classifications graphene oxide based composites activated carbon biochar materials agricultural waste biomass polymers magnetic polymers covalent metal organic frameworks and others subsequently we overviewed the factors that influence the adsorption of pollutants in wastewater treatment 3 1 1 graphene oxide based composites graphene oxide go results from the oxidation of graphene it has a large specific surface area outstanding water solubility and a significant number of oxygen containing functional groups including carboxyl carbonyl hydroxyl and epoxide which is the hypothetical standpoint for their application in removing dyes from pdw 82 83 however the formation of go composites through functionalisation remains a suitable option to avert agglomeration between go layers 84 prevent repulsion between go and anionic dye molecules 82 and enhance the reusability of go aerogel in wastewater treatment 85 based on this perspective researchers are cross linking and modifying go to produce composites with impressive sorption performances for instance bryan et al 82 crosslinked go with chitosan through an amidation reaction to produce graphene oxide chitosan go cs composite with enhanced adsorption capacity both materials complemented the shortcomings of each other i e combining the go s mechanical strength and oxygenated sites and chitosan s enhanced surface area as a result there was an increased methylene blue mb adsorption capacity from 374 41 mg g for go to 379 53 mg g for go cs similarly nguyen et al 85 prepared a composite aerogel made of cellulose nanofiber and go cnf go the resulting composite aerogel not only adsorbed over 99 of mb in water but also enabled five time reuse of the adsorbent with an adsorptive capacity of 90 overcoming the earlier stated limitation of go aerogel in related research a naturally existing organic material humic acid was used to modify go after which it was made magnetic 83 the magnetic humic acid go composite showed a maximum adsorption capacity of 59 0 mg g for mb more importantly go based composites have shown to be a superior adsorbent for cationic pollutants and have found use in the textile industry for dye recovery this characteristic was elucidated through the selective adsorption of mb in a methylene blue methyl orange mo mixture using cnf go adsorbent 85 their result depicted rapid adsorption of mb in water within 20 min contact time leaving mo in solution nevertheless the reviewed go composites may show poor adsorption for anionic pollutants which is not advantageous for practical applications due to the variety of pollutants in real pdw 3 1 2 activated carbon biochar materials activated carbon ac and biochar are well known and applied adsorbents in the textile industry for pdw treatment the ac technology is potentially sustainable and low cost because of the ubiquity of biomass serving as a precursor for ac materials production thus it offers a potential approach to converting waste into treasure 86 90 the adsorbing properties of ac can be improved by using activating agents such as koh naoh h3po4 and zncl2 the last being a recognised and preferred activating agent because it enhances ac s surface area increase yield and improves the development of pores in the carbonaceous structure 91 92 several studies have utilised ac or biochar for adsorbing pollutants in pdw the variation in these studies is majorly on the biomass precursor targeting those that are in abundance 70 those that are creating uncontrollable wastes 93 and those that produce ac or biochar with the desired adsorbing moieties 86 accordingly groundnut shell produced ac was modified with ceria and applied in the removal of mb in an aqueous solution 93 the adsorbent s enhanced surface area 1258 m2 g total pore volume 0 33 cm2 g and the presence of lactonic carboxylic and phenolic functional groups which are acidic sites greatly improved the adsorption capacity of mb 199 76 mg g similarly cornstalk derived biochar was used in decolourising a modelled pdw effluent under a competitive adsorption mechanism 94 the results revealed that the adsorption capacities of mb 274 84 mg g and gentian violet gv 266 57 mg g in a single component system were altered in a two component system they indicated that increasing gv concentration from 10 to 20 mg l while maintaining mb concentration at 40 mg l resulted in the mb adsorption capacity decreasing from 325 15 to 287 73 mg g in another related research yu et al 86 fabricated a kapok fiber derived biocarbon with an excellent total pore volume 0 76 cm3 g and ultrahigh surface area of 1455 m2 g the ac adsorbent showcased an exceptional adsorption capacity of 1983 39 mg g for congo red cr dye in an aqueous solution other biomass derived ac or biochar applied in the pdw treatment and their pollutants removal efficiency are presented in table 1 overall the ac or biochar fabrication method biomass structural and inherent properties and activating agents seem to contribute to efficiency in pollutants adsorption 95 3 1 3 agricultural waste biomass biomass from agriculture is also used without pyrolysis for the adsorptive removal of dye wastewater pollutants they are known to contain lignin protein hemicelluloses cellulose and different functional groups suitable for the pollutants adsorption 96 97 although the inability of biomass adsorbents to maintain excellent adsorption capacity in a mixed pollutant system was a significant drawback that limited their application research efforts have been devoted to making this ubiquitous material amenable to pdw pollutants accordingly liu et al 98 prepared a straw based adsorbent by modifying waste rice straws with citric acid and acrylamide groups the adsorbent was found suitable for removing both acidic and basic dyes coupled with metal ions in a mixed system moreover the adsorption capacities of the modified adsorbent for mb 120 84 mg g and methyl orange mo 3053 48 mg g dyes were as much as 3 and 54 times those of the unmodified straw respectively in addition in other similar studies pulverised saccharum arundinaceum leaves 99 and humulus leaves 100 from a perennial vine were the adsorbent of choice for removing mb dyes from wastewater the former study observed a decrease in the mb removal efficiency from 93 to 76 when the mb concentration was raised from 5 to 100 mg l also the latter study recorded an adsorption capacity of 146 2 mg g for mb at a 100 mg l concentration interestingly the removal efficiency for mb originally 92 only reduced to 80 after five cycles of reuse showing the recyclability of this biomass adsorbent 100 3 1 4 polymeric chitosan based composites a polymer comprises repeating monomers held together by covalent bonds the primary merit of using polymers for adsorption is the possession of many functional groups that are easily modifiable chitosan cs is a cationic biopolymer formed from the deacetylation of chitin 101 the amino group in cs is protonated in the acidic medium resulting in the adsorption of anionic pollutants including dyes 102 this mechanism offers the cs based composites a great possibility for acid dye adsorption in pdw treatment consequently zhao et al 103 applied a chitosan based octa amino polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes carbon nanotubes composite poss cnts cs in the treatment of dye wastewater the study s result showed excellent adsorption capacity of the composite for mo 63 23 mg g and cr 314 97 mg g in the modelled dye wastewater besides the adsorption was possibly due to the interaction between the nh2 oh groups in cs and so3 and nh2 so3 groups in mo and cr respectively similarly in recent work by xu et al 102 mxene cs composite was made magnetic using nano fe3o4 to construct a novel mxene fe3o4 cs composite the prepared composite derived its superior adsorption capability from the large surface area and numerous functional groups of mxene nh2 oh groups of cs and easy magnetic selective separation and surface functionalisation of nano fe3o4 as a result the adsorption capacity of the composite for cr was 620 22 mg g and could be reused eight times while still maintaining cr removal efficiency of 80 furthermore a novel chitosan lignin composite was recently fabricated for the removal of mb from modelled dye wastewater 104 the composite that offered the maximum adsorption capacity 128 69 mg g for mb utilised 1 1 by weight of cs lignin materials the study reveals the impact that the weight of each composite part can have on the adsorptive performance of a composite additionally recent research by rashid and co workers explored the functionalisation of cellulose with tio2 105 the surface potential of the cellulose tio2 was largely positive thereby rapidly adsorbing 100 of acid red g dye within 3 min in addition the composite showed good reusability after five cycle with a removal efficiency of 63 39 3 1 5 covalent metal organic framework composites metal organic frameworks mofs are highly ordered three dimensional crystalline materials consisting of organic ligands which bridge metal ions 73 on the other hand covalent organic frameworks cofs are crystalline organic polymers produced by strong covalent bonds 106 both frameworks are known and widely used in various applications because of their permanent porosity huge specific surface area superior crystal structure and high stability 106 to enhance the properties of these organic frameworks to selectively adsorb the desired dye molecules and other ions in dye wastewater researchers are designing a variety of cof mof composites for instance han and co workers explored the formation of a cof composite with amino collagen fiber acf a biological matrix for the adsorptive removal of acid fuchsia and reactive blue 19 dyes the result of the study showed that the aminated cf increased the number of nh2 groups on the composite s surface thereby enhancing the adsorption capacity of acid fuchsia 257 98 mg g and reactive blue 19 449 54 mg g in a related research si et al 107 explored the use of ni and co to furnish the mof surface with numerous active cationic sites the ni co mof composite served as an excellent adsorbent for reactive dye producing an adsorptive capacity of 200 mg g also the removal efficiency of the dye after five cycles 95 indicates the exceptional recyclability of the ni co mof composite on the other hand dang et al 108 targeted nine different cationic dyes thus fabricating so3h functionalised anionic ionic liquid cof and grafting imidazole onto it to produce imi tpbd so3 2 composite among the dyes mb showed maximum adsorption 2841 5 mg g on the cof composite at a ph of 9 0 conversely the cof composite did not show any adsorption capacity for anionic dyes such as mo 108 the studies above have depicted the excellent tunability of cofs mofs which is advantageous for the adsorptive removal of typical pollutants in pdw 3 1 6 other adsorbents other adsorbents which are not grouped under the above classification are herein discussed bentonite clay carbon nanotubes carbon dots and manganese sand filter have been used to remediate dye wastewater accordingly the surface of mgal layered double hydroxide was modified by sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate and coated with carbon dots to form the cds mgal ldo composite 109 the prepared composite showed maximum adsorption capacity for malachite green mg direct blue 5 and cr dyes in the range of 3628 9 to 5174 1 mg g the modified carbon dots altered the inherent hydrophilic feature of the layered double oxides which created an attraction for organic pollutants in the dye wastewater further cnts were prepared through a microwave assisted technique for the removal of crystal violet cv from pdw 110 the study reported a removal efficiency of 85 for cv more importantly in a real dye wastewater treatment a banded iron bentonite magnetic composite bif ben was explored 111 in this study the hematite and magnetite were expected to promote the performance of bentonite adsorption and improve the other basic separation challenges respectively as such the composite showed a high removal efficiency between 74 5 and 81 for inorganic e g cd cr pb nitrate and organic e g acid red and cv dyes pollutants in the natural textile wastewater 111 3 1 7 the effects of adsorption process parameters 3 1 7 1 the influence of ph ph is a parameter of interest when considering the adsorbent to make the adsorbate to remove and the separation solution in adsorption technology generally the adsorption of cationic pollutants is favoured on the upper right of the ph scale while the reverse is the case for anionic pollutants 112 113 basically at neutral to higher ph the oxygen containing functional groups e g carboxyl hydroxyl and epoxide are deprotonated hence offering more adsorption sites and ligands for the cationic pollutants adsorption 114 115 conversely at lower ph the protons in the solution compete with the cationic pollutants for the binding sites on the adsorbent minimising the available active groups for pollutant adsorbent interaction leading to a low pollutant removal rate 104 116 zeta potential is an essential parameter that elucidates the ph influence the adsorbent s active sites protonation or deprotonation partly depends on the zero potential charge point phpzc 117 fig 1a c present the association between the zeta potential of different adsorbents and ph and how they influence pollutants adsorption in fig 1a the phpzc of the fe modified lignin based biochar fe lb was 3 5 70 thus at ph phpzc the composite contained positive charges whereas at ph phpzc it possessed negative charges moreover as ph changed from 2 to 12 the mb removal efficiency by fe lb marginally increased from 95 to 100 indicating the composite s broad ph range for adsorption nevertheless the adsorbent having negative zeta potential with the ph range of 4 12 is suitable for adsorbing cationic dyes fig 1b represents amphoteric adsorbents such as the cellulose graft poly glycidyl methacrylate l lysine cell g pgma lys with both co2 anionic and n h3 cationic groups 118 therefore the composite became cationic or anionic when the solution s ph was lower or higher than phpzc thus the reactive brilliant red and mb dyes were efficiently removed at ph 2 and 12 respectively on the other hand fig 1c represents cationic adsorbents here the zeta potential of cds mgal ldo was positive within the ph range of 3 0 9 5 109 such adsorbents are not particularly suitable for electrostatic adsorption of cationic pollutants however other mechanisms of adsorption may come into play 3 1 7 2 the effect of temperature temperature plays a crucial role in the adsorption process particularly when modelling the treatment of pdw the typical temperature range of a real textile effluent is 35 45 c 82 119 therefore the adsorption capacities of pollutants during simulation studies should be assessed within such a temperature range to illustrate bryan et al 82 observed a decrease in the adsorption capacity of the go cs composite for mb from 379 53 to 372 28 mg g as the temperature increased from 30 to 50 c this gradient occurs because the adsorptive force between the composite s adsorption sites and the dye molecules decreased at an elevated temperature moreover the removal efficiency of mb only decreased from 94 88 to 93 07 indicating that the go based adsorbents effectively remove dyes from textile effluent without significantly fluctuating to cause major failures conversely mustafa et al 120 noticed an increase in mb adsorption capacity from 370 37 to 476 19 mg g as the temperature rose from 25 to 55 c using zncl2 modified neem leaves powder the performance of this adsorbent in elevated temperatures indicates that the resultant adsorption process is endothermic 121 which is good for the pdw treatment 3 1 7 3 the effect of pollutant initial concentration adsorbent dosage normally an increase in the initial concentration of the pollutant increases the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent and decreases the adsorbate removal efficiency in this respect sanad et al 111 explained that the sites on each unit mass of the adsorbent progressively filled as a large number of dye molecules are exposed to them eventually the sites saturate resulting in a decrease in the removal efficiency moreover bryan et al 82 observed that as the dosage of the go cs adsorbent increased from 250 to 1250 mg l the mb removal efficiency increased from 94 88 to 99 36 while the adsorption capacity decreased from 379 53 to 79 49 mg g in this case most of the available adsorption sites at low dosage remain unoccupied even at higher dosage thus dropping the adsorption capacity 82 3 1 7 4 the effect of contact time it is vital to afford the adsorption process adequate time sufficient to take the process to sorption equilibrium 82 since contact time varies from process to process accurate determination of each adsorption batch process is necessary the earlier the contact time for a process to reach equilibrium the better this swift reaction saves cost and ensures a good turnaround time in practical application 122 in addition sanad et al 111 observed that the adsorption process of cv and acid red on the bif ben composite was rapid at the initial stage until it attained equilibrium at 60 min nevertheless the gradual reduction in the accessible adsorption sites on the adsorbent s surface might have contributed to the longer adsorption time 3 1 8 the mechanism of pollutant s adsorption the main pdw pollutants that have been remediated through adsorption technology are dyes metals and anions most dyes have aromatic rings which are rich in π electrons in addition they possess functional groups that are easily ionisable in solution also metal ions and anionic molecules can adsorb on surfaces with opposite charges therefore the adsorption technique leverages these properties and those of the adsorbents to decontaminate pdw fig 2a c summarise the various adsorption mechanisms expected in the treatment of pdw fig 2a elucidates the adsorption mechanisms of anionic and cationic aromatic dyes malachite green mg is typically protonated under low ph thus electrostatic attraction between the cationic adsorbent and mg is an unsuitable mechanism therefore surface complexation and π π interaction are the leading adsorption mechanisms 109 conversely electrostatic attraction surface complexation and π π interaction are the dominant mechanisms for the anionic cr and db5 dyes in fig 2b both electrostatic attraction and co adsorption mechanisms are in effect whereas in fig 2c all the enlisted mechanisms together with pore filling emerge as the mechanisms of adsorption overall all the adsorption mechanisms encountered in the reviewed articles are based on one or more of the presented mechanisms 3 2 membrane separation technologies the membrane technology has become an advanced separation technique for example in the textile industry for the treatment of printing and dyeing wastewater pdw in the membrane technological process the solution is passed through a porous membrane barrier 136 thus for pdw treatment it entails the passage of wastewater containing dyes salts divalent and monovalent cations and anions and other solutes through a porous membrane for removal usually dye molecules will be separated from the water because of the size or charge difference relative to the membrane generally larger dye molecules and those with similar charges as the membrane will be easily rejected also salts such as nacl mgcl2 and na2so4 may pass through the membrane while electropositive membranes tend to retain multivalent cations 137 membrane separation on the other hand has drawbacks such as high running costs and membrane fouling 138 despite its low rate of decomposition a non commodity for practical use efficiency and high toxicity the treatment feasibility of the biodegradation approach is restricted 34 139 membrane separation has a high operating and maintenance cost and the membrane is easily contaminated resulting in performance loss 37 43 44 although printing and dyeing wastewater contain complex pollutants most research dealing with membrane separations concentrates on dyes and salts removal with only a few additionally giving interest to the removal of cations turbidity conductivity chemical oxygen demand cod total organic carbon toc and anions already the high aromaticity and reduced reactivity of dyes make their biological and chemical degradation processes unfavourable conferring on membrane technology their effective separation approach 140 moreover in addition to the conventional membrane filtration techniques that consist of membrane materials such as polysulfone polydopamine and polypyrrole advanced integrated membrane filtration technologies have been recently popular in treating printing and dyeing wastewater based on the available literature nanocomposite membranes and membrane distillations are some advanced membrane based filtration technologies that have been widely applied in the textile industry evidently the integrated membrane systems show improvement in membrane properties derived from integrating the filtration properties of the membranes with extra functionalities such as stability porosity and enhanced surface area therefore we review membrane filtration technologies for pdw based on conventional membrane filtration microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf advanced integrated membrane techniques nanocomposite membranes membrane distillations and reverse forward osmosis ro fo notably various nanocomposite membrane techniques still fall under the identified membrane filtration methods 3 2 1 conventional membrane filtration techniques 3 2 1 1 microfiltration microfiltration is regarded as a low pressure separation process and mf membranes typically have pore sizes varying between 0 1 and 5 μm 141 ceramic mf membrane is suitable for treating real textile dye bath effluents because it offers simplicity of cleaning and regeneration high water permeability less fouling tendency superior mechanical and thermal stability and corrosion resistance 142 literature indicates that ceramic mf membranes showed a considerable removal efficiency to cod 25 colour 26 sulphates 34 tds 31 bod 39 turbidity 21 and chlorides 33 from textile effluents treatment study 142 in a more recent study a biopolymer keratin was used to functionalise an mf membrane composed of polyethyleneimine polyacrylonitrile pei pan materials 143 the neglected waste keratin showed great potential in functionalising conventional membranes to achieve 93 25 rejection of alizarin red in simulated textile wastewater importantly improvements are being made to mf processes by combining them with other separation processes such as coagulation flocculation 144 and anaerobic forward osmosis 145 in the case of using woven fiber microfiltration combined with fo to treat synthetic textile wastewater colour and cod removal reached 96 4 and 99 2 respectively 145 3 2 1 2 ultrafiltration ultrafiltration membranes are constructed to separate certain pollutant types from pdw wastewater by employing a pressure driven process 146 the applied pressure is lower than in nf and ro thus to remove multivalent cations that characterise most pdw micellar enhanced ultrafiltration and polymer enhanced ultrafiltration processes are applied the former being a reliable approach to metal ions removal 147 various recent research studies on the use of uf membrane process for the treatment of dyeing wastewater have used different single polymers such as polyethylenimine polydopamine and polypyrrole as well as combined polymer porous material e g polyvinylidene fluoride metal organic framework mof as membranes 148 150 cationic dyes such as methylene blue and crystal violet are satisfactory for dyeing acrylic fibres but typically possess smaller molecular weights and require positively charged membranes for separation 151 in this regard a tight ceramic uf membrane was fabricated and modified with aminosilane through grafting enhancing the membrane surface s positive charge the ceramic membrane s surface was covalently bonded to amino functional groups compensating for its surface charge weakness 151 besides electrostatic repulsion according to the donnan exclusion effect was instrumental in rejecting the cationic dyes since their low molecular weight supports the penetration of the porous membrane more so the results from the evaluation of simulated dyeing wastewater showed that the rejection of salts is in the order na2so4 mgso4 nacl mgcl2 this trend is explained by the more electrostatic repulsion of divalent metal in salts than the monovalent counterpart by the positive membrane regardless the so4 2 ion is shown to neutralise the cationic membrane resulting in a lower rejection than the na2so4 similarly the zeta potential 15 6 mv indicated a positive membrane and the rejection rates of methylene blue and basic green which are cationic dyes were 78 5 and 72 4 respectively 151 3 2 1 3 nanofiltration this is another pressure driven membrane separation process which falls in between reverse osmosis and ultrafiltration membrane processes nanofiltration technology is an important sought after separation technique for example in the textile industry for treating printing and dyeing wastewater for reuse already the tiny molecular size of the pollutants in dye laden wastewater which characterises textile wastewater makes the application of microfiltration and ultrafiltration technologies unsuitable besides the high molecular weight cutoff mwco of uf membranes restricts the achievement of adequate dye recovery 152 nevertheless there is exhaustive literature demonstrating the potential of nf membranes to remove dyes and inorganic salts from textile wastewater thus the removal of these pollutants and reuse of treated pdw creates a solution that will minimise operational costs in the textile industry 153 to achieve this goal there is a need for an improvement in the choice of nf membranes fabrication and functionalisation which are accomplished in integrated membrane techniques 3 2 2 advanced membrane based filtration technologies 3 2 2 1 nanocomposite membranes currently researchers are trying new materials composite fabricated by inserting small molecules or nanomaterials into other more stable materials or supports these nanocomposite membranes have shown great superiority over the traditional membranes in water and wastewater treatment imparting the desired porosity surface charge and contact angle for better rejection improved permeation and minimized fouling 140 154 155 thus in the treatment of simulated dyeing wastewater through sulphate radical enhancement liu et al 150 fabricated a zif 67 pvdf uf membrane through the nonsolvent induced phase separation technique the intercalated mof improved the membrane pore structure and enhanced sulphate radical generation through peroxymonosulfate pms activation this solution in design approach provided a self cleaning ability to the membrane fig 3a illustrates the mechanism of the pms anti fouling process which significantly increased the flux recovery the fabrication of membranes with enhanced antifouling performance is key in membrane technology especially for pdw treatment due to the likelihood of membrane fouling by dye molecules biochemicals and humic solutions 148 156 157 moreover the synthesized membrane efficiently removed some dye molecules including rhodamine b 90 5 methylene blue 98 2 and orange ii 97 3 more so in a more elaborate study for pdw treatment from a real textile plant different commercially available uf membranes mainly polyamide poly ether sulfone polysulfone and polyacrylonitrile were used 158 the molecular weight cut offs mwco of the uf membranes varied from 2 to 50 kda but the membrane with the lowest mwco i e polyamide performed better however comparative uf results in table 2 showed that the composite membrane removed 50 of all the investigated parameters including turbidity bod5 toc cod tnb so4 2 conductivity na k and ca2 interestingly the permeate was found apposite for washing dyed knitted cotton fabric producing the same quality of fabric as would textile clean water in addition colour removal efficiency increased from 93 in 1 h to 98 in 3 h furthermore a similar study on real textile pdw treatment applied halloysite nanoclay hnt doped with zro2 tio2 as a tight ultrafiltration ceramic membrane 159 ceramic membranes are low cost and readily available but their standalone practical application in pdw treatment has been limited because of their unsatisfactory thermal and chemical stability under harsh corrosive and aggressive conditions because of their sio2 and al2o3 components 160 on the other hand zro2 is a refractory material with sufficient thermal resistance and hydrophilicity suitable for pdw treatment thus zro2 doped hnt is expected to increase fluxes and minimise fouling 161 this combined performance of zro2 tio2 hnt was tested by ağtaş et al on three real wastewater samples from a textile company their results indicated that the toc removal efficiency varied from 3 to 43 the cod removal efficiency ranged between 5 and 55 while colour removal efficiency was in the range of 40 83 however when the temperature of the real wastewater was increased to 72 c the flux value increased from 4 5 to 10 l m2 h without significant change in the removal rates of the pollutants 159 another stable material used as substrate in composite membranes is graphene oxide go xiao et al 162 fabricated a new perylene 3 4 9 10 tetracarboxylic dianhydride modified zr mofs graphene oxide for pdw treatment the produced go ptcda uio 66 nh2 exhibited an excellent dye rejection close to 100 under a wide ph range elevated salt concentration and multiple recycling the composite membrane prepared through vacuum filtration self assembly is shown to have its intercalating materials ptcda and uio 66 nh2 grow like ropes on each other and link the go through a π π conjugation fig 3b besides uio 66 nh2 furnishes oh and nh2 that form electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bonding with the go s o2 containing functional groups thereby strengthening the stability of the composite more importantly the excellent dye rejection performance of the composite membrane see table 2 is linked to the electrostatic interaction size screening hydrogen bonding and π π stacking between the dye molecule and membrane components fig 3b another similar study that employed a go based membrane focused on fabricating an approximately 1 nm size wrinkled graphene go composite membrane 163 the idea was to screen dyes and salts with a larger size than 1 nm as depicted in fig 3c the wg go composite membrane exhibited high rejection rates for dyes crystal violet congo red and trypan blue of 1 nm while the sub nm sized dye molecules neutral red and methylene blue were poorly rejected moreover the higher rejection of na2so4 than nacl is attributable to the higher electrostatic repulsion between the composite membrane and so4 2 than with cl overall notwithstanding the possible electrostatic repulsion interference between the membrane surface and dyes the size controlled rejection approach through membrane surface modification is commendable in another recent study not only that a bimetallic mofs fecubdc material was inserted into a go nanosheet but also additional hydroxylated graphene goh was added to increase the composite membrane s interlayer and enhance the self cleaning catalytic degradation effort to reduce fouling 164 using acidic or oxidising solutions to clean membranes is likely to generate secondary pollution thus persulfate activation of the membrane to self clean online or offline is a desired membrane characteristic for industrial application although the vacuum filtration methods have been popular in fabricating mof based nf membranes 162 164 165 other techniques are being explored including nonsolvent induced phase separation 150 interfacial reaction and in situ self assembly reaction 166 film casting technique 167 and phase inversion technique 168 which is consistent with the quest for renewable nf membranes that possess satisfactory permeance and a high rejection rate for treating complex textile wastewater another membrane material that has enticed researchers interest due to its crystalline porous nature highly defined channels large surface area tunability and facilely tailored functionalities is covalent organic frameworks cofs 169 170 because of high salt concentrations embodying pdw that is already laden with dyes and other organic molecules cofs are being intercalated into various substrates for selective membrane nf processes specifically modifications that create electrostatic interactions between cofs membranes and dye molecules to intensify low molecular dye rejection and salt dye separation are a solution to the textile pdw treatment challenges in this regard sheng et al 169 fabricated a cationic cof membrane through an interfacial growth method they inserted 1 3 5 triformylphloroglucinol triaminoguanidinium chloride tptgcl a cof into a hydrolysed polyacrylonitrile hpan substrate the performance of this membrane suggests that the recovery and reuse of dyes from pdw are possible this was shown by the high rejection of mb dye and very low rejection of monovalent and divalent salts table 2 the tailoring of this membrane to permeate salts and reject dyes is unlike other cofs with high salt and dye rejections designed to generate clean water for reuse in the textile industry for instance tp polyamide cof intercalated into pan to form the tppa pan membrane demonstrated superior salt and dye rejections of 90 and 97 respectively 171 the prepared membrane possessed a negative surface charge thus creating electrostatic repulsion for the hydrated ions of the salts and the negatively charged dyes both steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion played useful roles in the separation for example the divalent hydrated ions so4 2 and mg2 were more hindered than their monovalent counterparts na and cl 1 whereas so4 2 was strongly repelled than cl 1 as a result the salt rejection trend was mgso4 na2so4 mgcl2 nacl the mechanism of separation for a similar cof is showcased in fig 4a where the cof tp tta mpsfx with a zeta potential of 36 mv could efficiently reject negatively charged dyes 172 however the rejection order of the dyes governed by their molecular weights suggests that the rejection was mainly determined by size exclusion the major difference between conventional nf and lnf is that the dense active layer of most nf membranes permits the simultaneous rejection of dyes and salts which is anti textile wastewater management 173 again lnf membranes have an extremely high water permeability high permeation of inorganic salts and superior dye retention efficiency which is a result of their loose structure besides physical size exclusion electrostatic interaction is a dominant factor on which the separation of nf membranes depends interestingly lnf membranes can be tailored to have enhanced negatively charged surfaces enabling the high rejection of dyes and excellent permeation of inorganic salt congruent with this notion kang et al 173 prepared a graphene oxide tannic acid nickel go ta ni lnf membrane the dye rejection was above 92 while the permeation of monovalent and divalent salts was 93 similarly ji et al 174 prepared a hollow fiber pvdf go ppy membrane with a multilayer structure therein the graphene oxide covers the interfacial pores of polyvinylidene fluoride while the membrane structure is decorated by polymerising polypyrrole on its surface fig 4b as a result the solvent free padding of the membrane increased the hydrophilicity enhanced electrostatic repulsion according to the donnan exclusion effect and improved rejections for negative dyes generally other superior polymers and polymer composites have been successfully utilised in the treatment of simulated and real dyeing wastewater table 2 provides a general overview of the various membrane technologies applied in recent times to treat wastewater from the textile industry these studies attempted to tackle the key issues in membrane filtration i e fouling stability and reusability of membranes in addition diverse optimisation techniques were put in place to enhance water permeability dye rejection salt permeation or rejection and the rejection of other solutes and organic materials nevertheless choosing appropriate monomers and monomer concentrations for membrane production is vital to reducing fouling tendencies the gap between pure water permeance and dye water permeance always indicates the appropriateness of the monomer selection for certain dyes to illustrate the decrease in resveratrol concentration in fabricating resveratrol tmc membrane from 0 4 wt to 0 1 or 0 2 wt resulted in dye cake layer formation and blockage of the membrane pores leading to severe membrane fouling and causing a reduced dye water permeance than when tested with pure water 175 this performance was due to the participation of only a fewer resveratrol monomer during the interfacial polymerisation process giving room for some dye molecules to partially diffuse into the membrane pores 3 2 2 2 membrane distillation membrane distillation md is a thermal membrane hybrid separation process its process permits the passage of only water vapour by a vapour pressure gradient through an extremely porous hydrophobic membrane 184 185 considering the zero liquid discharge strategy and no additional heating requirement in md technology because of an elevated temperature of dyeing wastewater it is considered a promising technology with energy efficient processes 186 moreover since the mild operating temperatures 50 80 c of the md process are congruent with the discharge temperature of the textile wastewater 187 it may serve as a cost effective separation process when merged with alternative energy sources although md separation technology basks in the merits of low applied pressure low operating temperatures and maximum dissolved ions rejection making it more advantageous over other desalination processes 188 the fabrication of enhanced hydrophobic membranes is a necessity to boost the wetting resistance of the membrane ordinarily the low applied pressure 0 15 bar in the dcmd process lowers the propensity of membrane fouling scaling thus the fouling tendency of the porous material for producing the membrane is linked to its hydrophobicity 187 moreover the outstanding interaction between the aromatic rings of the dye molecules and the membrane surface in dyeing and printing wastewater leads to increased fouling in the md process the differential vapour pressure between both sides of the membrane drives the vapours in the gas phase across the membrane 189 as such the inducement of the vapour pressure difference vpd is the basis of the various existing md configurations to illustrate in direct contact md dcmd vacuum md vmd air gas md agmd and sweeping gas md sgmd the vpd is induced by a temperature difference vacuum a temperature difference and flowing a low humidity gas respectively 189 193 in recent times several modifications have been made to these basic md configurations to enhance their effectiveness in purifying wastewater and desalination technology and they include vacuum membrane distillation crystallization 194 and vacuum enhanced air gap membrane distillation 195 among the above mentioned md processes dcmd continues to garner attraction for printing and dyeing wastewater treatment for being simply configured can generate high flux with adequate operating conditions no need for an external condenser and suits water based separations 185 196 however vdm promises minimal heat loss reduced concentration and temperature polarisation and enhanced permeate flux 190 nevertheless at varying degrees md processes suffer pore wetting as a result of feed water ingress into the membrane pores depreciation in vapour pressure due to temperature and concentration polarisation and membrane fouling caused by solid deposits on membrane pores leading to pore obstruction and flux reduction on long application 197 therefore to eliminate these drawbacks researchers are focusing on optimising membranes hydrophobicity membrane fabricating methods membrane cleaning strategies and using computational fluid dynamics simulations and statistical models such as response surface methodology rsm and artificial neural network to optimise process parameters and predict responses 190 198 to expatiate new strategies are now employed for enhancing the existing membrane materials and customising new ones to acquire superior hydrophobic porous properties adequate porosity and pore size and high permeability the enhancement of these membrane features is vital for the practical applications of md technology for printing and dyeing wastewater treatment various polymer materials including polytetrafluoroethylene polypropylene and polyvinylidene fluoride have been used as md membranes to enhance the performance of the separation technique more recently mixed matrix polymer membranes are being investigated huang et al 199 fabricated a metal organic framework zeolitic imidazolate framework 71 zif 71 incorporating it into poly vinylidene fluoride cohexafluoropropylene pch this composite zif 71 pch produced by electrospinning displayed an improved surface roughness and hydrophobicity for enhanced treatment of dyeing wastewater they reported a high dye rejection of approximately 100 for acid red acid yellow crystal violet and methylene blue dyes additionally a novel mof mil101 fe infused poly vinylidene fluoride co hexafluoropropylene pvdf hfp was studied for its dye removing ability from the textile industry wastewater 200 therein rsm was also applied in assessing the flow rate and feed temperature impacts on dye rejection and permeate flux to enable membrane performance optimisation as a result both the predicted flux 6 75 l m2 h dye rejection 98 14 and experimentally observed flux 6 66 l m2 h dye rejection 98 22 values showcase the advantages of the simultaneous rsm and dcmd use in textile wastewater treatment furthermore yadav et al 190 took advantage of the benefits of vdm and rsm for methyl orange dye removal from textile dyeing wastewater the optimised parameters from the rsm simulation were the input process parameters resulting in a high dye rejection of 99 81 and permeate flux of 19 60 l m2 h in addition the sem analysis of the used membrane provided evidence of less severe dye deposition made possible by high liquid entry pressure lep high pore wetting resistance and superior hydrophobicity of the ptfe membrane 190 more so the electrospinning technique for fabricating nanofibrous materials provided leeway to overcome the low permeation flux challenge of the traditional microporous md membranes it offers numerous benefits including controllable thickness low cost simple fabricating equipment and a variety of spinnable materials 199 201 in addition membranes of substantially high porosity 90 low mass intensity and a large surface to volume ratio have been generated using environmentally benign solvents while emitting less co2 and generating little waste 198 moreover research has shown that a zif pch membrane fabricated through a one step electrospinning approach effectively prohibited the membrane pores from wetting during dyeing wastewater treatment in dcmd operation 199 besides the fabricated membrane exhibited a high permeation flux attributable to its large pore size and porosity notwithstanding the positive offers of the electrospinning method its application has been successful in lab scale production of electrospun nanofibrous membranes rather than on a large scale the limitations in upscaling the use of electrospun membranes include elongated electrospinning time 8 24 h low fiber productivity and unavailability of low cost and easily assessable commercial polymers coupled with only a few practical applications for real hot dyeing wastewater treatment 202 however improved mass productivity of nanofibers can be achieved using the gas assisted electrospinning gae technique the concept here is to direct an inert gas stream e g dry air to exert a drag force on the polymer solvent jet and the taylor cone through the co axial nozzle to boost nanofiber productivity 187 fig 5a b show the schematic diagram of the conventional versus gas assisted electrospinning systems the gae spinneret is composed of double needles in the co axial configuration the gas stream passes through the outer needle 14g while the polymer solution is transferred through the inner needle 18g unlike the single tube needle that transfers only a few μl of the polymer solution per hour in the conventional electrospinning system the modified gae technique injects 135 μl min of the solution 187 more importantly it was reported that the technique exhibited a large nanofiber mass production rate than the conventional technique counterpart and was successfully applied in the treatment of real dyeing wastewater with almost 100 dye rejection rate and low pore wetting 187 furthermore regarding membrane cleaning strategies studies are taken advantage of nanoparticles that can simultaneously attach both porous and photocatalytic properties to the membrane material for the promotion of high flux and easy regeneration in this regard tio2 nanoparticle was incorporated into pvdf co hfp to produce a mixed matrix membrane mmm pvdf co hfp tio2 that displayed an outstanding photocatalytic property yadav et al 191 reported that the mmm completely regenerated dye fouled membranes under uv irradiation at 365 nm after 4 h at 1 h uv irradiation the flux of 4 7 kg m2 h approximately 80 of the flux at 4 h was achieved with no further observable flux change after 4 h from the preceding paragraphs it is obvious that enormous research is ongoing to overcome the shortcomings of the various md configurations interestingly these research endeavours are yielding commendable results as very recent literature is reporting the application of different md processes in dyeing wastewater treatment with successes table 3 presents some of the recent studies that applied md technology in the treatment of synthetic or actual dye wastewater from textile industries it is observed that the high dye rejection permeate flux and optimum pore size indicated by these studies is because of the various improvements made on either the membrane materials fabricating technique or the md configuration process 3 2 3 reverse forward osmosis reverse osmosis has found use in printing and dyeing wastewater treatment because of its effectiveness in removing inorganic and organic contaminants it is a high pressure driven process of filtration due to a narrower membrane pore size 0 5 nm compared to nf 203 reverse osmosis is essential for removing dissolved minerals contributing to the high conductivity of textile wastewater and for water recovery even after removing cod toc and colour by any of the chemical and biological processes 204 one pilot scale study on the use of ro for pdw treatment indicated high removal of conductivity from 5500 μs cm in the feed to 150 μs cm in the permeate with 70 water recovery 204 nevertheless a well known challenge in using ro for treating textile wastewater is membrane fouling fouling heightens the differential pressure between the feed and concentrate increases energy consumption elongates filtration time and may cause permanent damage to the membrane 205 on the other hand disc tube reverse osmosis dtro has been designed to discharge the concentrated liquid from the flange of the feed end this process helps in overcoming the ro challenge above and may advance future pdw treatment still the produced concentrate stream is rich in salt and other organic pollutants impeding its reuse presently dtro is being used in combination with other technologies for the effective treatment of pdw for instance jing et al 205 combined fenton oxidation low temperature crystallization and dtro to treat pdw for reuse in the textile industry furthermore forward osmosis a more energy saving separation method is gaining the attention of both researchers and industries fo is different from the conventional pressure driven membrane techniques as it applies differential osmotic pressure between the draw and feed solutions for its separation process thus unlike ro fo has found use in the textile industry for concentrating and recovering dyes from pdw to illustrate li et al 206 used a support free fo to concentrate and recover dyes from artificial pdw the applied membrane poly triazole co oxadiazole co hydrazine had excellent dye retention as the actual concentration of cr was 9 99 g l besides the membrane demonstrated a remarkable antifouling property showing a flux recovery ratio of 98 7 after regeneration in an alcohol solution furthermore apart from dyes other life threatening metals are applied in the textile industry for instance antimony sb compounds are used as a catalyst to fabricate polyester fiber and have been implicated in human carcinogenicity 207 based on the dire need to remove potentially toxic elements from pdw before discharging into the environment meng et al 207 implemented an fo technology for the removal of sb from real pdw fig 6 shows the fo schematic module and the likely mechanism of sb rejection by the aquaporin fo membrane here since the aquaporin membrane has a dense layer suitable for rejecting small ions such as k cl and na the larger hydrated ionic radius of sb was advantageous thus the rejection and retention of sb were a result of steric hindrance due to large hydrated sb ion and the donnan effect since the negatively charged aquaporin membrane and positively charged sb and other co existing ions could interact more importantly this fo process showed excellent sb rejection 99 7 proving the suitability of fo in removing sb from real pdw additionally other physical separation processes that have been applied in the treatment of printing and dyeing wastewater include coagulation ion exchange and flotation by colloidal gas aphrons cga cgas are a system of extremely stable micron sized bubbles 10 100 μm that possess large interfacial areas similar water flow properties can retain a charge identical to the surfactant solution and easily separate from a bulk liquid 208 recently dermiki et al 209 used cga in a flotation column to separate dye mixtures in different modes the authors reported that the electrostatic interaction between the dye molecules mb and mo and the surfactant stabilised microtubules the cga was the observed mechanism for mo recovery 70 9 similarly pal et al 208 used a natural surfactant extract from the tree ziziphus spina christi to prepare a cga for anionic and cationic dye removal from an aqueous solution their result indicated that the natural surfactant acceptably removed anionic and cationic dyes in a two step sequential flotation process that is the fresh cga initially removed about 79 of mb while the regenerated and reused cga removed an additional 37 of cr 4 advanced oxidation process for printing and dyeing wastewater there are two main categories of aops the photochemical and non photochemical aops the photochemical aops include photochemical oxidation using uv and catalyst use of uv h2o2 uv o3 uv o3 h2o2 photo fenton fe2 uv h2o2 the non photochemical aops include ozonation ozonation h2o2 fenton fenton h2o2 wet air oxidation electrochemical oxidation catalytic wet air oxidation before the interest in aops various technologies have been employed and previously reported for printing and dyeing effluent treatment they include adsorption technology filtration coagulation flocculation and biological treatment technologies these technologies have shown major set backs for example filtration suffers from fouling and high cost adsorption technologies suffer from long contact times with pollutant coagulation flocculation is inefficient against soluble dyes biological methods suffer from poor applicability at large scales 210 hence the alternative procedures to printing and dyeing effluent treatment is the advanced oxidation process aop sometimes the combined synergy between two or three aops are employed works better table 4 shows the mechanism of aops like fenton photochemical photocatalytic ozonolytic electrochemical and ultrasound aops while table 5 shows their strengths and weaknesses aops have attracted lots of interest because it generates highly reactive radical species in situ under ambient conditions of temperature and pressure these radical species attack organic moieties in dye effluents through hydrogen abstraction electron transfer and radical addition 211 consequently no matter the method or mechanism of attack the radical scavenges the organic moieties non selectively and rapidly at rates as high as 106 109 m 1 s 1 211 the first method of effluent treatment aops is the ozonation processes this involves a direct or indirect attack of effluent species using ozone o3 the efficacy of this treatment technology depends largely on ph level under acidic ph ozone attacks organic moieties in dyes and inks as electrophile while under basic ph ozone reacts rapidly with oh to yield ho 212 ozone can be coupled with h2o2 peroxonation or coupled with other catalysts catalytic ozonation when coupled with transition metal ions it is homogenous catalytic ozonation 213 and when coupled with metal oxides it is heterogeneous 214 a previous industrial research investigated ozone decolourisation treatment of printing ink wastewater and obtained decolourisation removal of 91 at ozone concentration of 11 mg l 215 baban et al reported the ozonation of printed wool effluents and obtained a decolourisation efficiency of 99 after 40 min of ozonation with absorption rate of 58 mg l 216 it has even been established that catalytic ozonation converts non biodegradable dye effluents to biodegradable forms turhan ozturkcan 217 investigated this phenomenon for reactive orange 16 dye effluents and its biodegradability after ozonation treatment the major parameters that influence ozonation of inks and dye effluents are ph ozone dose and concentration of catalyst 218 alkaline ph is the best for ozonation since high level of reactive oh radicals are released at this ph turhan et al reported cod removal of direct dye in effluents increased from 23 to 65 with ph increase from 6 to 12 219 muthukumar et al reported 64 cod removal in acid red 88 effluent when ph increased from 3 to 11 219 khadhraovi et al reported higher treatment efficiency with o3 h2o2 than ozone treatment alone 220 the optimal molar ratio reported in this treatment is 1 45 the disadvantage of using ozone is that it generates toxic and carcinogenic compounds after treatment in other works 25 cod removal was achieved for a printed textile effluent using mnfe2o4 in a catalytic ozonation treatment also direct red 80 was decolourised up to 94 and cod removal was 43 using o3 h2o2 ratio of 1 100 221 222 another very powerful aop for printing and dyeing effluent treatment is the photochemical aop this aop involves treatment of effluents using uv absorption since most dye molecules are photoactive they can absorb uv to reach excited state leading to bond rupture uv o3 photochemical aop in preferred to uv h2o2 the molar absorption coefficient of o3 is 200 times higher than that of h2o2 223 however the use of uv s2o8 2 uv ps and uv hso5 uv pms can significantly remove dye effluents than uv o3 in uv ps and uv pms show high redox potential than uv oh the major parameters that affect photochemical aop is uv light intensity oxidant concentration ph and the kind of water sample low pressure uv lights have been the most frequently used and effective for photochemical aop while the oxidant concentration must not be too high at very high concentration of oxidant the radicals generated tend to scavenge themselves leading to a lower effluent removal rate 224 aleboyeh et al shows that treatment with uv h2o2 for azo dye after 25 min achieved 99 decolourisation and after 120 min toc removal of 95 was achieved 225 direct red 80 was decolourised up to 94 and cod removal was 43 using o3 h2o2 ratio of 1 to 100 221 shu 226 achieved 80 decolourisation within 30 min with direct blue 199 using uv h2o2 the photocatalytic method of inks and dyes wastewater treatment involves the generation of radicals from solid catalysts by the process irradiation photo excitation occurs when the absorbed uv photons have an energy equal to or greater than the semiconductor energy gap in the photocatalyst see fig 7 photo excitation in photocatalysis releases radicals through water ionisation oxygen ionosorption superoxide protonation etc all generating oh radicals 227 228 photocatalysis depends on parameters like catalyst type and irradiation source various photocatalysts like tio2 zno wo3 have been employed doped catalysts like tio2 zno tio2 sio2 srtio3 ceo2 have also been used 229 230 arcanjo et al 231 reported photocatalytic treatment of textile mill effluents using hydrotalcite fe2o3 tio2 under uv achieved 96 removal than unmodified tio2 88 at ph 10 and 2 g l dosage photocatalysis is more stable at ambient but has low quantum efficiency and suffers from mass transfer limitations at catalyst interphases 232 the fenton process generates lots of oh when fe2 and h2o2 are mixed together photo fenton and electro fenton are even more efficient at decolourising and mineralising of inks and dyes fenton processes depends heavily on ph and fenton dose a low ph of 3 works best for fenton at high ph concentrations of fe3 reduces by precipitation into fe oh 3 hence prevent the generation of more fe2 from fe3 reduction 233 patel et al employed treated reactive red 241 wastewater through fenton at ph 4 7 and 10 234 pazdior et al reported an optimum dose of 0 8 g h2o2 and 0 06 g fe2 235 ribeiro et al achieved 65 cod removal when mass ratio of cod h2o2 fe3 is 1 2 2 236 other works includes use of cu2cl oh 3 nanoflowers to achieve 98 decolourisation of rhodamine b dye 237 photo fenton oxidation was carried out on methylene blue using feooh bi2wo6 and a decolourisation efficiency of 98 was obtained 238 ma xia 239 treated printing effluents by sequential fenton oxidation and coagulation for 30 min at ph of 4 with 50 mg l h2o2 and 25 mg l fe2 yielded 80 92 46 colour removal cod and solids removal zhang et al employed fenton action and adsorption to treat lithographic ink wastewaters they achieved 90 colour removal but 50 cod removal ma xia 239 used uv fenton to treat ink wastewater from circuit board products with cod removal of 92 chua loh 240 combined ultrasound and fenton showing 81 colour removal and an activation energy of 18 2 kj mol catalytic wet air oxidation is a green and friendly aop for treating dyes and inks in waste water it employs air oxygen at high pressure over 20 mpa and high temperature over 200 c to oxidize dyes and ink based pollutants into nh3 co2 and dissolved simple salts however in the presence of catalysts higher efficiency can be reached at much lower temperature and pressure 241 244 ternary fe2o3 ceo2 tio2 immobilized on alumina in wet air oxidation achieved 98 colour removal and 96 toc removal for methyl orange within 2 h 243 zhang et al 245 applied zinc based polyoxometalates zn1 5pmo12o40 for the catalytic wet air oxidation of safranin t 98 colour removal 92 toc elimination and 95 cod elimination was achieved in 1 h 245 wet peroxide oxidation method as reported by kondru et al achieved 100 colour removal and 58 cod removal in 4 h the optimum conditions for the reaction ph 7 0 6 ml h2o2 1 g l zeolite catalyst 246 the wet peroxide oxidation appeared to be better than the wet air oxidation in terms of colour removal however the wet air oxidation achieved higher toc and cod elimination than the wet peroxide oxidation other advanced catalytic wet oxidation methods include the oxidation of dye mixtures use of noble metals supported on mixed metal matrices like mgal mgce and other processes that involves the optimization of gas flow flow rates and other flow parameters 247 ma xia 239 reported the oxidation of a binary dye mixture containing methyl orange and methyl blue using cuomoo3 p2o5 under atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature 99 colour removal was obtained for initial dosage of 0 3 g l electrochemical oxidation is very efficient for printing ink treatment it is versatile stable and cost ok in this method suitable voltages are applied on the electrode surfaces resulting in production of electrons on the electrode surface to break down heavy printing inks 248 the mechanism proceeds via a direct or indirect route direct mechanism exists on the anode and indirect on the cathode or other areas far from anode side with production of electrons through faradaic reactions 249 in the indirect mechanism electrons are produced in other areas in the cell through electrolysis and water splitting 250 rajkumar kim 251 performed electrochemical treatment experiments on reactive inks they employed dimensionally stable titanium electrode anode to achieve 83 and 45 cod and toc reduction at a current density of 72 ma cm2 and a supporting electrolyte concentration of 4 g l nacl in 120 min 251 jović et al 252 employed electrochemical oxidation to treat reactive blue 52 black 5 green 15 yellow 125 using a platinum electrode and 0 1 m na2so4 supporting electrolyte voltages of 6 12 and 24 v were varied 12 v performed best and gave a percentage colour removal of 58 after 1 h 252 morsi et al 249 achieved 100 ink colour removal using pbo2 anode at a current density of 20 macm 2 najafpoor et al 253 carried out a capacitive oxidative technique to decolorize red 120 using graphitic carbon anodes and a cellulosic separator papadopoulos et al 254 used an up scaled electrocoagulation technique to treat a printing ink with cod concentration as high as 2500 mg l initial cod from a paper packaging industry the reaction conditions investigated were ph 5 10 voltage 5 40 v mixing rate 0 400 rpm electrolyte concentration 0 05 0 40 g l alumina plate electrodes 1 5 cm distance current densities 2 8 ma cm2 94 colour removal 90 cod elimination 81 removal of copper turbidity who achieved in the offset printing wastewater the electrochemical method can be effective on thicker printing waste effluents 254 diamadopoulos et al 255 employed boron doped diamond anode to achieve 100 removal of effluent turbidity in the presence of lime as a precipitating agent but only 20 cod decrease however in the presence of alum a coagulating agent higher cod removal 60 was obtained the efficiency increased with higher applied currents under alkaline conditions 255 5 biological treatment the biological treatment approach is believed to be a cheap environmentally responsible and economically viable way to degrade wastewater particularly wastewater that contains colours 256 due to its genetic diversity and flexibility it has developed into a novel therapeutic option for the problem of coloured water contaminants such as salts carbon dioxide and rubbish can be converted into inorganic substances by biological materials the dye degradation is performed by using metabolic pathways or adsorption which makes use of both living and dead biomass including bacteria fungi yeasts algae and plants as shown in table 6 257 the biological technique only removes the dissolved material from textile wastewater the ratio of organic load dye to microbial load system temperature and oxygen content are all factors that affect removal effectiveness according to how much oxygen they require several biological processes can be categorised 258 5 1 under aerobic conditions under aerobic circumstances particular enzymes the majority of which are azo reductases catalyse dye degradation in large part when azo reductase and other substances are present some aerobic microbes may degrade dyes and then develop intermediate metabolites i e aromatic nh2 that are decomposed by microorganisms in the presence of oxygen to accomplish the entire mineralisation of azo dyes alizarin yellow r ay degradation was investigated by liang et al 274 utilising a hybrid strategy of fe carbon micro electrolysis as well as aerobic oxidation the final effluent s ay degrading efficiency was 96 5 the removal rates of total organic carbon toc were 69 86 and 79 44 respectively 5 2 under anaerobic conditions based on similar findings azo dyes can be successfully decoloured at a redox potential of 50 mv when used in anaerobic environments a colourless odourless and poisonous intermediate metabolite of aromatic amines which is frequently mineralised under aerobic circumstances is produced when the chromophore groups of dyes are broken apart furthermore it has been observed that aerobic respiration may dominate nadh usage and hinder the transport of electrons from nadh to the azo bond which generally lowers the reduction activity of the azo bond in the presence of oxygen additionally it has been noted that anaerobic circumstances might lead to the mineralisation of aromatic nh2 with functional hydroxyl and carboxyl groups anaerobic circumstances can lead to the degradation of some aromatic amines that are prone to self oxidation according to cao et al 275 the reactive brilliant red x 3b rbrx 3b dye in eams had a degradation efficiency that was 10 greater than the combined degradation efficiency of ms 61 9 and ecs 27 1 rbrx 3b degradation might be accelerated by the eams which combines an electrochemical system with an anaerobic microbial system rbrx 3b was converted into poisonous and harmless hydrocarbons in eams to completely mineralise the dye different bacterial strains require organic carbon as a source of energy for their growth according to palanivelan et al 276 however some bacteria that use the azo complex as a carbon source have also been observed to be able to survive on it 277 5 3 bacterial biodegradation of dyes prior studies on the microbial degradation of wastewater in recent years have primarily focused on developing a wide variety of superior decolourisation strains for the degradation and adsorption of dyes in wastewater as well as the development of efficient engineering bacteria and other improved technologies therefore it is crucial to comprehend how various microorganisms decolourize and degrade in order to provide a favourable environment for microorganisms the decolourisation impact of the electroactive bacteria shewanella oneidensis mr 1 on the azo dye cationic red x grl was investigated by li et al 278 s oneidensis mr 1 showed a greater capacity for decolourising x grl under ideal anaerobic circumstances ph 5 0 8 5 25 45 c and reaction duration of 12 h bacillus circulans bwl1061 a recently discovered strain that is salt tolerant was investigated by liu et al 279 for its ability to decolourise methyl orange the outcomes revealed that the breakdown of methyl orange by bwl1061 required the recent isolated salt tolerant strain nadh dcip reductase azo reductase and laccase the strain bwl1061 may also break down aromatic amines lessening the dye s toxicity in the process a salt tolerant yeast strain called g1 was discovered by song et al 280 who also tested the organism s ability to decolourise different azo dyes including acid red b arb under ideal circumstances the intermediate aromatic amines may be further mineralised and the decolourisation rate of 50 mg l of arb within 16 h was up to 98 the essential decolourisation reductase was found to be nadh dcip reductase such as klebsiella pneumonia enterococcs sp and escherichia coli also showed promising decolourising efficiency on diverse colours to address the environmental issues facing business future research must focus on this crucial area of microbial studies 281 5 4 algal biodegradation of dyes algae are commonly found in both freshwater and saltwater and they are currently the subject of intense research as a bio sorbent algae have the highest bio sorption potential and electrostatic force of attraction for pollutants in wastewater due to their huge surface area and binding capacity 281 algae are primary producers and their cell walls include functional groups including hydroxyl carboxylate amino and phosphate which are important for eliminating contaminants from aqueous solutions 282 based on the colour and colloid content they are divided into categories there are three different forms of marine algae brown red and green because they are common in nature marine algae are used as a source alginate carrageenan and polycolliod are the three main polysaccharides found in algae algae performance and selection are influenced by biosorption affinity and capacity 257 algae are everywhere and are receiving more attention in the field of degrading textile wastewater several types of algae have been employed effectively 258 algal decolourisation of the dye has three distinct methods algae employ chromophores to gather algal biomass co2 and water next they use the chromophores to convert chromophore material into non chromophore material finally they adsorb the resulting chromophore onto the algal biomass according to some studies certain algae species including cosmarium sp ulva lactuca sargassum spirogyra rhizopus pithophora sp nostoc muscorum spirogyra rhizopus and chlorella pyrenoidosa used for acid red 247 and methylene blue desmodesmus sp are efficient at breaking down azo dye according to other studies several types of algae use azo dyes as a source of c and n for growth 281 5 5 fungal biodegradation of dyes various fungus species have been identified and tested for cleaning the effluent outflow from dyeing industries for the biological breakdown of textile colours many bacteria have combined aerobic and anaerobic treatment with encouraging results 283 an effective remediation method for treating textile paper and pulp industry effluent that contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is phanerochaete chrysosporium pah phanerocheate chrysosporium which generates enzymes like laccase lignin and nganese peroxidase that promote the decolourisation of different dyes was examined by senthilkumar et al 284 another fungus trichoderma harzianum which has been used to clean the effluent from the textile sector was investigated by singh and singh 285 bromophenol blue was discovered to have the greatest inhibitory effect 43 a variety of fungal cultures were utilised for bioremediation because they have characteristics like rapid growth a lot of biomass and a wide range of hyphal colours that made them more efficient than bacteria 286 due to their high surface to cell ratio filamentous fungi were mentioned by joutey et al 287 as an efficient degrader in a specific environment aspergillus strain mmf3 and optimization of nacl for the efficient degradation of textile colour orange 3r singh et al 288 achieved 96 efficiency on the fifth day under ideal circumstances a concentration of 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 nacl resulted in further drops of 56 44 and 42 respectively for all trials carried out at varying nacl concentrations the greatest colour loss was seen on the fifth day this fungus strain attracted interest in the biological treatment of dyeing mill effluents due to its great decolourisation capacity and capacity to function in unfavourable settings verma et al 289 marine derived fungi have the ability to break down the anthraquinone dye reactive blue 4 and can also be used in bioremediation processes the two step degradation process begins with the partial treatment of pure laccase and ends with chemicals with low molecular weight through an enzymatic process the findings showed a 29 decrease in total carbon and a 20 decrease in toxicity using the laccase enzyme obtained from trametes polyzona strain wr710 1 chairin et al 290 investigated the decolourisation and deprivation of bisphenol a and other synthetic dyes anthraquinone dye reactive blue 4 that underwent laccase treatment saw roughly 61 decolourisation and saw a two fold reduction in cod in 12 h the biodegradation of wattle extract and other synthetic colours has been extensively researched using a variety of fungal cultures including penicillium sp and aspergillus niger 291 5 6 enzyme s biodegradation of dyes enzymes are the most effective molecules for speedily assisting the sequential breakdown and destruction of complicated substances unspecific cytoplasmic enzymes that function like azoreductases have been found in the cytoplasm of several bacterial species on the other hand a number of oxidoreductive enzymes including laccases azoreductases manganese peroxidases and lignin peroxidases are known to take part in the breakdown of dyes for the purpose of degrading azo dyes without producing hazardous aromatic amines the laccase enzyme uses a non specific free radical mechanism trametes versicolor was able to decolourise orange g azo dye by 97 292 by using the laccase enzyme pseudomonas desmolyticum strain ncim 2112 to completely degrade dyes like direct blue 6 and red he7b kalme et al 293 achieved effective results 6 future perspectives there is no doubt that the efforts of various researchers have focused on the study of the treatment of pdw to a considerable height however based on the review of literature some research gaps were observed which would be necessary for the improvement of this research area the high concentration of colouring matter and other contaminants in pdw poses a challenge to the environment and humans therefore the improvement of the treatment technologies at the various unit operations can maximise the efforts at curtailing this menace product recovery from the waste stream optimisation of printing and dyeing processes to curtail the use of extra water related contaminants optimisation of treatment technologies to improve efficiency and save cost and the adoption of zero liquid and waste discharge from the process which ensures that a minimal volume of fresh water is utilised in the process should be considered future studies should ensure that futuristic treatment methods strike a balance between being environmentally friendly efficient and cost effective the biological technique which is the conventional way of treating pdw is insufficient for removing several recalcitrant and persistent contaminants this is brought on by pdw s substantial refractory content furthermore the issues of high sludge production low toxic load tolerance and organic shock combined with a slow degradation rate persist one of the most feasible ways to overcome these shortcomings is the utilization of advanced integration systems which have shown improved abilities for treating wastewaters such as pdw due to their high efficiency and low operation cost however there has yet to be any study in literature that utilizes such a system studies involving the use of integrated systems that involve more than one of these treatment technologies such as integrated ceramic membrane with ultrafiltration system integrated microfiltration process with heterogeneous photocatalytic system and integrated biological biofilm and ozonation system should be encouraged furthermore to ensure the long term stability and operation of these technologies process parameters should be tuned at the lab and pilot scale and life cycle impact and cost benefit analyses should be performed to demonstrate the usefulness of hybrid technologies at the industrial scale it has been observed that the treatment technologies have been paying more emphasis on the removal and degradation of cationic dyes especially methylene blue with less attention being paid to the removal and degradation of anionic and non ionic dyes in addition the use of adsorption by various researchers has been centred on the removal of dyes and toxic heavy metals from pdw however less attention has been paid to the effect of the process on other parameters such as phosphate chloride and sulphate concentration turbidity colour cod and bod 7 conclusion in this study the authors reviewed various technologies that have been applied for the treatment of pdw and their strengths and weaknesses pdw is the aqueous effluent released by factories that operate the dyeing and finishing of wool and silk among other things this is the first study that discusses various treatment technologies that have been utilised for the treatment of pdw the treatment technologies utilised for treating pdw include physical based techniques such as adsorption and membrane technology chemical based techniques such as advanced oxidation processes aops and biological processes physico chemical treatment is frequently used to treat pdw but it is either not cost effective or cannot be utilised in large scale due to the large volume of wastewater involved even though the adsorption technique is efficient for the removal of dyes relatively simple user friendly and cost effective with a removal efficiency of 80 it is best suited for low concentration pdw it suffers from a long contact time with the pollutant membrane technology on the other hand is known for its minimal energy usage operation at room temperature and simplicity of operation with a rejection rate of 90 however high running costs and membrane fouling are some of its drawbacks aops that have been utilised for the degradation of pollutants in pdw include fenton photochemical photocatalytic electrochemical and ultrasound aops these processes are green sustainable and simple to use and operate however its major drawback is the change in the characteristics of molecules in the system or the production of free radicals which could have unfavourable consequences the biological technique which is the conventional way of treating pdw and utilizes micro organisms such as algae fungi enzymes and bacteria is insufficient for removing several recalcitrant and persistent contaminants this is brought on by pdw s substantial refractory content furthermore the issues of high sludge production low toxic load tolerance and organic shock combined with a slow degradation rate persist from the study it was observed that advanced oxidation processes is the most viable technique for pdw treatment due to its simplicity efficiency scalability and from the economic point of view to be sustainable pdw treatment technologies should strike a balance between being environmentally friendly efficient and cost effective funding there was no external funding for the study compliance with ethical standards this article does not contain any studies involving human or animal subjects

paper 
12768,the scarcity of clean and fresh water in some parts of the world which is exacerbated by man s activities either through domestic or industrial use has been an age old cause of worry printing and dyeing wastewater is the aqueous effluent released by factories that operate the dyeing and finishing of wool and silk among other things the printing and dyeing wastewater pdw contains a high concentration of dyes salts and other contaminants this study is a review of published literature that utilised various technologies for the treatment of pdw the studied technologies include adsorption membrane technology advanced oxidation processes and biological processes the strengths as well as the drawbacks of these technologies were studied it was observed that adsorption membrane technology and biological processes recorded a removal efficiency of 80 a rejection rate of 90 and an effective dye degradation rate of 96 respectively from the study it was observed that advanced oxidation processes is the most viable technique for pdw treatment due to its simplicity efficiency scalability and from the economic point of view future perspectives such as product recovery from the pdw waste stream modelling and optimisation of the printing and dyeing processes and the adoption of zero liquid and waste discharge were also presented in this study finally pdw treatment technologies should strike a balance between being environmentally friendly efficient and cost effective to achieve robust and sustainable wastewater treatment programs graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords environmental protection wastewater treatment advanced oxidation processes membrane processes biological treatment adsorption data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction water is necessary for the survival of all forms of life on earth hence it must be free of pollution 1 3 water purification is a critical topic that has recently gained a lot of attention 4 5 textile industries are a newly emerging area that is rapidly expanding due to the great pressure of global population expansion 6 7 textile businesses utilise a variety of colours that are eventually dumped into freshwater reservoirs 7 8 the textile industry s water contamination has had a negative influence on the ecosystem necessitating rapid action to remediate the dye laden wastewater the textile industry releases a large amount of wastewater through various unit operations like scouring bleaching dyeing and printing that are seen during textile making of the 1 million tons of toxic dye and ink effluents generated about 0 3 million tons are discharged without proper treatment 9 printing and dye wastewater pdw is the aqueous effluent released by factories that operate the dyeing and finishing of wool and silk among other things dyeing and finishing activities in the textile industry account for up to 20 of all wastewater discharged globally 10 total dye usage is 10 000 tons per year with roughly 100 tons entering the environment via the water supply 7 11 dyes may degrade or react with other elements in the environment during migration producing a variety of hazardous and dangerous compounds 10 these toxic compounds have teratogenic and neurotoxic effects on people who ingest polluted agricultural and fishery products in addition to harmful effects on the organisms in the ecosystem 12 13 dyes can cause respiratory irritation jaundice and vomiting at low doses organic dyes can also harm the lungs liver kidneys heart and brain over time 14 because these dyes are particularly water soluble a considerable portion of them ends up in the effluent during the dyeing process 6 7 dyes are one of the most dangerous and poisonous toxins found in a variety of industries including cosmetics 15 16 food textiles paper rubber printing and plastic 6 11 as a result it s critical to remove these toxic dyes from increasing effluents before they re released into the environment 7 17 dyes in wastewater hinder sunlight from diffusing into the water disrupting plant photosynthesis 11 18 organic dyes are among the most common types of water pollutants primarily emitted during the printing textile and paper manufacturing processes 14 19 grease and waxes 20 leather 21 textiles 22 pharmaceuticals 23 foodstuffs 24 cosmetics 25 hair 26 fur 26 plastics 27 and paper 28 as well as sensors 29 lasers 30 photography 31 optical data storage 32 paints 33 and brighteners have all applied dyes 14 azo dyes are now frequently utilised owing to their high jet blacks lack of dust high solubility and other benefits 34 their annual consumption accounts for almost 70 of overall dye consumption unfortunately during the manufacturing and use of this product a large amount of printing and dye wastewater is created 35 the majority of organic contaminants found in dyeing effluent are benzene derivatives which have relatively persistent chromophores 34 acidic basic cationic direct and reactive anionic dyes as well as diffused non ionic dyes have been classified based on their charge in an aqueous solution 36 formazan anthraquinone phthalocyanine oxazine and azo are examples of reactive anionic dyes that are grouped into several classes based on their molecular structure 34 reactive dyes have been widely used in the textile industry due to their strong water solubility and affinity for binding with textile fibres 14 15 in many countries treating textile dye wastewater before releasing it into bodies of water has become normal policy and is heavily enforced 14 15 as a result developing improved and cost effective technologies for the remediation of pdw has piqued environmentalists interest 37 another major consideration is the cost of dye clean up technologies 38 when considering cost effectiveness a dye removal procedure should be capable of removing dye quickly without causing additional pollution 38 39 printing effluent contains azo dye and is not only generated from textile making it is also produced from plastic printing and cardboard lithography printing effluents are very difficult kinds of effluents to work with they are made of non biodegradable compounds and mostly carry a significant amount of hg and cd 40 on the other hand dye effluents contain mostly organic moieties like ketones aldehydes amino nitro sulphur and conjugated chromophores which are not as hard to handle as ink effluent 41 presently three types of treatment techniques are used to treat dyes in pdw which include physical treatment adsorption 42 membrane separation 43 44 and coagulation flocculation 45 chemical treatment chemical oxidation 46 photocatalytic oxidation 47 and electrochemistry and biological treatment anaerobic treatment aerobic treatment and anaerobic aerobic combined treatment 37 48 various researchers have reviewed the concept of the treatment of pdw xu et al 49 published a mini review on the subject matter they summarized the recent progress of anaerobic based textile wastewater treatment systems such as up flow anaerobic sludge blanket expanded granular sludge bed anaerobic baffled reactor anaerobic membrane bioreactors and hybrid systems the working principles characteristics and treatment performance for each system are summarized in their work among several available processing technologies the anaerobic technology has attracted more interest in recent decades due to environmental concerns and regulations and the continuous rising of wastewater discharge standards and industry standards it was suggested that there is a pressing need to develop affordable and effective treatment techniques for textile printing and dyeing wastewater zhongchuang 39 reviewed the use of plant biomass carbon as an adsorbent for the treatment of pdw their study summarizes current literature discussing the preparation method and physicochemical characteristics of pbc prepared from different plant species the effect of plant biomass carbon pbc on the removal of different dyes influencing factors affecting the removal and relevant adsorption models using plant biomass carbon for the adsorption of dyes was a feasible and economical technology this study was limited based on the focus being on the treatment of dyes alone as well as the choice of adsorbent as other non plant adsorbents were not considered de aragao umbuzeiro et al 50 conducted a study on whether dyes emitted within the discharge of a dye processing plant contributed to the mutagenicity repeatedly found in the cristais river sao paulo brazil they discovered that the components of the black dye commercial product were present in the environmental samples arising from discharges at a local textile wet processing plant except for the drinking water sample analyzed contributing to the mutagenic activity detected in the same samples the conventional treatment employed by the drinking water treatment plant seemed efficient for removing dyes and fluorescent compounds because they were not detected in the drinking water samples but in the sludge extracts because the discharge of the azo dye processing plant analyzed in their study seems to be indirectly affecting the quality of the drinking water mutagenic dyes and possibly other genotoxic substances present in the effluent should be better characterized toxicologically before being released into the aquatic environment in areas where water is taken for human consumption studies by al tohamy et al 51 and samsami et al 52 reviewed the various technologies for the remediation of dye contaminated wastewater detailed knowledge on the adverse impacts of dye containing textile wastewater on natural ecosystems and living organisms along with the various existing and advanced treatment approaches for the better management of textile wastewater towards environmental safety were studied by al tohamy et al 51 their findings show that a wide range of toxic xenobiotics is found at high concentrations in textile wastewater posing severe environmental and public health risks toxic dye containing wastewater is a significant problem because textile mills regularly discharge millions of gallons of highly polluted wastewater worldwide many traditional and emerging treatment approaches for dye containing wastewater were reported dye removal degradation from dye containing wastewater appears to be effective using physical and chemical methods a wide range of physical chemical and biological technologies for removing dyes from wastewater was reviewed by samsami et al 52 and it was evident that each of these technologies has its advantages limitations and drawbacks hybrid or integrated processes could achieve very high colour removal efficiencies and a mixture of dye containing effluents could be treated without any significant operational difficulty membrane bioreactor and photocatalytic membrane reactor technologies have proven simple reliable and cost effective at the lab and pilot scales though comprehensive these studies were limited to the removal of dyes alone based on these studies and to the best of the authors knowledge a research gap currently exists which entails research covering the entire spectrum of treatment technologies that have been employed for the treatment of pdw the purpose of this research is to examine the currently available printing and dyeing wastewater treatment technologies this is the first study that discusses various treatment technologies that have been utilised for the treatment of pdw the recent literature on the various treatment technologies for the pdw is summarized in this review it is the first study of its kind to look at how different technologies might be used to improve pdw treatment efficiency the study also discusses the inadequacies of present technologies as well as the direction of future research in depth knowledge and understanding of these pdw treatment technologies are expected to be gained from this study 2 a brief description of the printing and dyeing industrial process most textile materials are offered value added treatments through dying and printing processes the infiltration of dye into a fiber configuration and the overall interaction between a dye and a fiber is called the dyeing process generally adsorption involves dyes transfer from the aqueous solution onto the surface of the fiber and diffusion dyes permeating all through the fiber are the technical procedures of dyeing 53 in the traditional dyeing process known as a black box the amount of dye on the fabric cannot be determined until the completion of the dyeing however computational and spectrophotometry advances have made beer s law more practical this allows the amount of dye on fabric to be deduced indirectly during the dyeing process 54 printing on the other hand can be viewed from colouration perspective as creating a resplendent pattern on fabric by using different colours to partially dye the fabric 53 given the complication of the dyeing or printing process as it involves different kinds of fiber fabric structure yarn dyes and dyeing technology all these influencing factors must be aptly controlled for the attainment of the desired printing or dyeing quality dyeing involves the use of large amounts of water and hence great importance should be attributed to the quality of water to be used for dyeing and printing it must meet such requirements as being colourless without any suspended solid and having a ph range of 6 5 7 5 53 the final textile materials are as a result of the fibres produced by the dye industry which are further converted into yarn these materials are produced using a stepwise series of wet processing 55 to get rid of certain undesirable dyeing defects such as dye precipitation unevenness chalking shade dulling or harsh handle the water should generally be purified of significant impact on the dyeing quality is the preparation and pretreatment of fabric structures which can make the dying quality better controlled and predictable 53 the dyeing process could be analyzed and controlled by introducing the principles of a dye bath monitoring technology this can assist to troubleshoot root causes in shade replicability that can emanate from variableness in dye potency the fabric or the dyeing process 54 the procedure of textile colouring permits unsettled dye to get washed out with the water in comparison with the wet procedure the dry procedure generates huge amounts of solid waste importantly several types of pollutants such as dyes crude oil hydrocarbons metals etc are associated with the industrial procedure 55 industrial manufacturing procedure involves basic industrial processing steps as concisely elucidated below 2 1 sizing and desizing as an important procedure sizing aids to further strengthen the yarn reduce its breakage and also to scale its resistance sizing plays the role of a coating or defensive wall to modify the complexion of components 56 environmental compatibility fabric types treatments of effluent easy removal cost effective etc are factors to be considered in selecting sizing agents natural elements like starch protein based starch cellulose by products etc constitute most sizing agents while other synthetic agents like polyesters polyacrylates acrylic resins etc are also notable constituents 57 desizing is the reverse of sizing which is a process aimed at removing completely the sizing agent from textile fabrics and also to make the fabric ready for further processing mostly employed are starch and its other derivatives due to their widespread availability very affordable cost and their excellent ability to form film enzyme desizing oxidative desizing removing water soluble sizes or acid desizing are the most commonly used desizing techniques for the completion of this procedure 58 2 2 scouring scouring is a chemical washing procedure which is used to expunge impurities like waxes fatty acids natural oils surfactants from fibres methods such as ice scour bridge scour tidal scour and hydrodynamic scour are commonly used 57 59 by products of scouring process are compounds released during scouring like naoh fats oils detergents surfactants wax spent solvents ethoxylates and alkylphenol 60 2 3 bleaching this process involves the removal of unwanted dye or colour from fibres different chemicals like hydrogen peroxide chlorine hypochlorite sodium hypochlorite and peracetic acid are often used while different chemicals have inherent disadvantages on the quality of yarn peracetic acid poses lesser defects to yarn and elevated sheen and hence more advantageous the fabrics creamy look is usually characteristic of the natural colour substance the phases of the bleaching process give off caustic soda hydrogen peroxide hypochlorite acids chlorine etc 55 2 4 mercerisation the process of improving the fiber strength dye affinity shrink age resistance and gloss of the yarn fabric through a treatment procedure involving the use of strong alkaline 19 23 by weight of naoh solution is called mercerisation 61 double or triple mercerisation is equally possible for higher end fabrics mercerisation increases the ph of wastewater while also releasing zncl2 cyclohexanols and caustic soda through the mercerising phase 55 62 2 5 dyeing and printing the colouration of fabric and dye treatment constitutes the dyeing process for an efficient dyeing procedure adequate attention should be paid to dwell time feed rate and temperature both dyeing and printing processes have characteristic waste materials as effluents reducing agents such as surfactants acetic acids dyestuff soap etc are released in wastewater due to the dyeing step 63 64 2 6 finishing the finishing process is the last phase of textile manufacturing it converts woven or finely knitted material into its desired useful purpose with high quality and other desirable properties like glibness waterproofing and final lustre this last procedure also partakes in the pollution of water 64 65 traces of starch salts tallow special finishes etc are released from the finishing process 62 2 7 effluent generation from the printing and dyeing industry with the utilization of a number of dyes chemicals and other substances by the textile industry to bestow desirable qualities on fabrics significant quantities of effluents are being produced these effluents possess undesirable qualities that are injurious to the environment if disposed without proper treatment 57 various chemical based processes are practised in numerous industries ranging from initial sizing to final washing that have hazardous environmental implications as some of these agents are corrosive to equipment and the handling process 59 printing of textile and wastewater dyeing has a characteristically poor bio degradability high ph high turbidity high chrominance complex composition and is discharged in massive quantities 49 the increasing awareness of the sustainability of water resources has become an important issue many process industries contribute to high water consumption and wastewater generation problems in industrial water management include the processing of complex contaminants in wastewater selection of wastewater treatment technologies as well as water allocation limited reuse and recycling strategies 66 one of the most important stages in textile manufacturing is the dyeing process the fibres are colourated during this phase and the adsorption process between colour and fibres may be improved using various chemicals a certain amount of these chemicals and dyes constitute the effluents generated from the printing and dyeing industry 67 there are three different kinds of fibres used in textile manufacturing namely protein fibres which are dyed with lanaset dyes and acid dyes cellulose fibres are dyed using indigo dyes reactive dyes direct dyes and napthol dyes and synthetic fibres are dyed using basic dyes direct dyes and disperse dyes 62 a huge quantity of water and several chemicals are used by the printing and dyeing industry during the textile manufacturing process with 1 kg of textile being estimated to require about 200 l of water for its production applying chemicals onto the fibres and washing the finished product are the major uses of water 68 the dye effluents produced during this process are high in colour ph suspended solids and chemicals containing trace metals like cu cr zn and as these effluents can jeopardise the environment and human health as they can cause skin irritation dermatitis haemorrhage nausea and ulceration of skin 62 67 3 separation technologies for printing and dyeing wastewater 3 1 adsorption treatment the adsorption treatment of dye wastewater remains among the most efficient methods of removing dyes to the permissible limits and it is relatively simple user friendly and cost effective 69 70 the adsorption treatment of pdw involves the transfer of pollutants mainly dyes metal ions and anions from the aqueous solution onto the solid surface of the adsorbent here the removal of the pollutants depends on the properties of the pollutants called adsorbates the adsorbent and the aqueous solution 71 72 more so the characteristics such as the pollutants charges molecular weights structural build up concentrations contact time with adsorbents the adsorbents amount functional groups their ionised species in solution available surface for adsorption and the solutions ph and more affect adsorption 73 74 notably the reviewed articles majorly targeted pollutants such as dyes and potentially toxic elements for the adsorptive treatment of pdw this choice is partly because other parameters such as chemical oxygen demand biological oxygen demand turbidity and phosphates are readily removed by membrane filtration and other treatment technologies in addition the adsorption technology contributes to the near zero waste drive through the reuse of adsorbents 75 adsorption is a common dye treatment approach in pdw due to its ease of use excellent selectivity reduced energy consumption and lack of toxic by products 10 42 76 in particular while the adsorption approach works well for low concentration soluble dyes renewing and totally destroying organic pigments is difficult 77 78 however a variety of adsorbents are used to remove colours from industrial wastewater 77 79 80 adsorption has gained some interest because of the recoverability low cost and high efficiency of carbon based adsorbents 19 78 adsorption of dyes is more appealing since there is no disintegration or any chemical reaction of dyes and dyes can be retrieved 79 81 the adsorbent used significantly impacts the efficiency of an adsorption mechanism 81 furthermore table 1 summarizes the recent studies that utilised various adsorbents for the adsorptive treatment of simulated and real pdw moreover we discussed this treatment technology based on the following adsorbent classifications graphene oxide based composites activated carbon biochar materials agricultural waste biomass polymers magnetic polymers covalent metal organic frameworks and others subsequently we overviewed the factors that influence the adsorption of pollutants in wastewater treatment 3 1 1 graphene oxide based composites graphene oxide go results from the oxidation of graphene it has a large specific surface area outstanding water solubility and a significant number of oxygen containing functional groups including carboxyl carbonyl hydroxyl and epoxide which is the hypothetical standpoint for their application in removing dyes from pdw 82 83 however the formation of go composites through functionalisation remains a suitable option to avert agglomeration between go layers 84 prevent repulsion between go and anionic dye molecules 82 and enhance the reusability of go aerogel in wastewater treatment 85 based on this perspective researchers are cross linking and modifying go to produce composites with impressive sorption performances for instance bryan et al 82 crosslinked go with chitosan through an amidation reaction to produce graphene oxide chitosan go cs composite with enhanced adsorption capacity both materials complemented the shortcomings of each other i e combining the go s mechanical strength and oxygenated sites and chitosan s enhanced surface area as a result there was an increased methylene blue mb adsorption capacity from 374 41 mg g for go to 379 53 mg g for go cs similarly nguyen et al 85 prepared a composite aerogel made of cellulose nanofiber and go cnf go the resulting composite aerogel not only adsorbed over 99 of mb in water but also enabled five time reuse of the adsorbent with an adsorptive capacity of 90 overcoming the earlier stated limitation of go aerogel in related research a naturally existing organic material humic acid was used to modify go after which it was made magnetic 83 the magnetic humic acid go composite showed a maximum adsorption capacity of 59 0 mg g for mb more importantly go based composites have shown to be a superior adsorbent for cationic pollutants and have found use in the textile industry for dye recovery this characteristic was elucidated through the selective adsorption of mb in a methylene blue methyl orange mo mixture using cnf go adsorbent 85 their result depicted rapid adsorption of mb in water within 20 min contact time leaving mo in solution nevertheless the reviewed go composites may show poor adsorption for anionic pollutants which is not advantageous for practical applications due to the variety of pollutants in real pdw 3 1 2 activated carbon biochar materials activated carbon ac and biochar are well known and applied adsorbents in the textile industry for pdw treatment the ac technology is potentially sustainable and low cost because of the ubiquity of biomass serving as a precursor for ac materials production thus it offers a potential approach to converting waste into treasure 86 90 the adsorbing properties of ac can be improved by using activating agents such as koh naoh h3po4 and zncl2 the last being a recognised and preferred activating agent because it enhances ac s surface area increase yield and improves the development of pores in the carbonaceous structure 91 92 several studies have utilised ac or biochar for adsorbing pollutants in pdw the variation in these studies is majorly on the biomass precursor targeting those that are in abundance 70 those that are creating uncontrollable wastes 93 and those that produce ac or biochar with the desired adsorbing moieties 86 accordingly groundnut shell produced ac was modified with ceria and applied in the removal of mb in an aqueous solution 93 the adsorbent s enhanced surface area 1258 m2 g total pore volume 0 33 cm2 g and the presence of lactonic carboxylic and phenolic functional groups which are acidic sites greatly improved the adsorption capacity of mb 199 76 mg g similarly cornstalk derived biochar was used in decolourising a modelled pdw effluent under a competitive adsorption mechanism 94 the results revealed that the adsorption capacities of mb 274 84 mg g and gentian violet gv 266 57 mg g in a single component system were altered in a two component system they indicated that increasing gv concentration from 10 to 20 mg l while maintaining mb concentration at 40 mg l resulted in the mb adsorption capacity decreasing from 325 15 to 287 73 mg g in another related research yu et al 86 fabricated a kapok fiber derived biocarbon with an excellent total pore volume 0 76 cm3 g and ultrahigh surface area of 1455 m2 g the ac adsorbent showcased an exceptional adsorption capacity of 1983 39 mg g for congo red cr dye in an aqueous solution other biomass derived ac or biochar applied in the pdw treatment and their pollutants removal efficiency are presented in table 1 overall the ac or biochar fabrication method biomass structural and inherent properties and activating agents seem to contribute to efficiency in pollutants adsorption 95 3 1 3 agricultural waste biomass biomass from agriculture is also used without pyrolysis for the adsorptive removal of dye wastewater pollutants they are known to contain lignin protein hemicelluloses cellulose and different functional groups suitable for the pollutants adsorption 96 97 although the inability of biomass adsorbents to maintain excellent adsorption capacity in a mixed pollutant system was a significant drawback that limited their application research efforts have been devoted to making this ubiquitous material amenable to pdw pollutants accordingly liu et al 98 prepared a straw based adsorbent by modifying waste rice straws with citric acid and acrylamide groups the adsorbent was found suitable for removing both acidic and basic dyes coupled with metal ions in a mixed system moreover the adsorption capacities of the modified adsorbent for mb 120 84 mg g and methyl orange mo 3053 48 mg g dyes were as much as 3 and 54 times those of the unmodified straw respectively in addition in other similar studies pulverised saccharum arundinaceum leaves 99 and humulus leaves 100 from a perennial vine were the adsorbent of choice for removing mb dyes from wastewater the former study observed a decrease in the mb removal efficiency from 93 to 76 when the mb concentration was raised from 5 to 100 mg l also the latter study recorded an adsorption capacity of 146 2 mg g for mb at a 100 mg l concentration interestingly the removal efficiency for mb originally 92 only reduced to 80 after five cycles of reuse showing the recyclability of this biomass adsorbent 100 3 1 4 polymeric chitosan based composites a polymer comprises repeating monomers held together by covalent bonds the primary merit of using polymers for adsorption is the possession of many functional groups that are easily modifiable chitosan cs is a cationic biopolymer formed from the deacetylation of chitin 101 the amino group in cs is protonated in the acidic medium resulting in the adsorption of anionic pollutants including dyes 102 this mechanism offers the cs based composites a great possibility for acid dye adsorption in pdw treatment consequently zhao et al 103 applied a chitosan based octa amino polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes carbon nanotubes composite poss cnts cs in the treatment of dye wastewater the study s result showed excellent adsorption capacity of the composite for mo 63 23 mg g and cr 314 97 mg g in the modelled dye wastewater besides the adsorption was possibly due to the interaction between the nh2 oh groups in cs and so3 and nh2 so3 groups in mo and cr respectively similarly in recent work by xu et al 102 mxene cs composite was made magnetic using nano fe3o4 to construct a novel mxene fe3o4 cs composite the prepared composite derived its superior adsorption capability from the large surface area and numerous functional groups of mxene nh2 oh groups of cs and easy magnetic selective separation and surface functionalisation of nano fe3o4 as a result the adsorption capacity of the composite for cr was 620 22 mg g and could be reused eight times while still maintaining cr removal efficiency of 80 furthermore a novel chitosan lignin composite was recently fabricated for the removal of mb from modelled dye wastewater 104 the composite that offered the maximum adsorption capacity 128 69 mg g for mb utilised 1 1 by weight of cs lignin materials the study reveals the impact that the weight of each composite part can have on the adsorptive performance of a composite additionally recent research by rashid and co workers explored the functionalisation of cellulose with tio2 105 the surface potential of the cellulose tio2 was largely positive thereby rapidly adsorbing 100 of acid red g dye within 3 min in addition the composite showed good reusability after five cycle with a removal efficiency of 63 39 3 1 5 covalent metal organic framework composites metal organic frameworks mofs are highly ordered three dimensional crystalline materials consisting of organic ligands which bridge metal ions 73 on the other hand covalent organic frameworks cofs are crystalline organic polymers produced by strong covalent bonds 106 both frameworks are known and widely used in various applications because of their permanent porosity huge specific surface area superior crystal structure and high stability 106 to enhance the properties of these organic frameworks to selectively adsorb the desired dye molecules and other ions in dye wastewater researchers are designing a variety of cof mof composites for instance han and co workers explored the formation of a cof composite with amino collagen fiber acf a biological matrix for the adsorptive removal of acid fuchsia and reactive blue 19 dyes the result of the study showed that the aminated cf increased the number of nh2 groups on the composite s surface thereby enhancing the adsorption capacity of acid fuchsia 257 98 mg g and reactive blue 19 449 54 mg g in a related research si et al 107 explored the use of ni and co to furnish the mof surface with numerous active cationic sites the ni co mof composite served as an excellent adsorbent for reactive dye producing an adsorptive capacity of 200 mg g also the removal efficiency of the dye after five cycles 95 indicates the exceptional recyclability of the ni co mof composite on the other hand dang et al 108 targeted nine different cationic dyes thus fabricating so3h functionalised anionic ionic liquid cof and grafting imidazole onto it to produce imi tpbd so3 2 composite among the dyes mb showed maximum adsorption 2841 5 mg g on the cof composite at a ph of 9 0 conversely the cof composite did not show any adsorption capacity for anionic dyes such as mo 108 the studies above have depicted the excellent tunability of cofs mofs which is advantageous for the adsorptive removal of typical pollutants in pdw 3 1 6 other adsorbents other adsorbents which are not grouped under the above classification are herein discussed bentonite clay carbon nanotubes carbon dots and manganese sand filter have been used to remediate dye wastewater accordingly the surface of mgal layered double hydroxide was modified by sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate and coated with carbon dots to form the cds mgal ldo composite 109 the prepared composite showed maximum adsorption capacity for malachite green mg direct blue 5 and cr dyes in the range of 3628 9 to 5174 1 mg g the modified carbon dots altered the inherent hydrophilic feature of the layered double oxides which created an attraction for organic pollutants in the dye wastewater further cnts were prepared through a microwave assisted technique for the removal of crystal violet cv from pdw 110 the study reported a removal efficiency of 85 for cv more importantly in a real dye wastewater treatment a banded iron bentonite magnetic composite bif ben was explored 111 in this study the hematite and magnetite were expected to promote the performance of bentonite adsorption and improve the other basic separation challenges respectively as such the composite showed a high removal efficiency between 74 5 and 81 for inorganic e g cd cr pb nitrate and organic e g acid red and cv dyes pollutants in the natural textile wastewater 111 3 1 7 the effects of adsorption process parameters 3 1 7 1 the influence of ph ph is a parameter of interest when considering the adsorbent to make the adsorbate to remove and the separation solution in adsorption technology generally the adsorption of cationic pollutants is favoured on the upper right of the ph scale while the reverse is the case for anionic pollutants 112 113 basically at neutral to higher ph the oxygen containing functional groups e g carboxyl hydroxyl and epoxide are deprotonated hence offering more adsorption sites and ligands for the cationic pollutants adsorption 114 115 conversely at lower ph the protons in the solution compete with the cationic pollutants for the binding sites on the adsorbent minimising the available active groups for pollutant adsorbent interaction leading to a low pollutant removal rate 104 116 zeta potential is an essential parameter that elucidates the ph influence the adsorbent s active sites protonation or deprotonation partly depends on the zero potential charge point phpzc 117 fig 1a c present the association between the zeta potential of different adsorbents and ph and how they influence pollutants adsorption in fig 1a the phpzc of the fe modified lignin based biochar fe lb was 3 5 70 thus at ph phpzc the composite contained positive charges whereas at ph phpzc it possessed negative charges moreover as ph changed from 2 to 12 the mb removal efficiency by fe lb marginally increased from 95 to 100 indicating the composite s broad ph range for adsorption nevertheless the adsorbent having negative zeta potential with the ph range of 4 12 is suitable for adsorbing cationic dyes fig 1b represents amphoteric adsorbents such as the cellulose graft poly glycidyl methacrylate l lysine cell g pgma lys with both co2 anionic and n h3 cationic groups 118 therefore the composite became cationic or anionic when the solution s ph was lower or higher than phpzc thus the reactive brilliant red and mb dyes were efficiently removed at ph 2 and 12 respectively on the other hand fig 1c represents cationic adsorbents here the zeta potential of cds mgal ldo was positive within the ph range of 3 0 9 5 109 such adsorbents are not particularly suitable for electrostatic adsorption of cationic pollutants however other mechanisms of adsorption may come into play 3 1 7 2 the effect of temperature temperature plays a crucial role in the adsorption process particularly when modelling the treatment of pdw the typical temperature range of a real textile effluent is 35 45 c 82 119 therefore the adsorption capacities of pollutants during simulation studies should be assessed within such a temperature range to illustrate bryan et al 82 observed a decrease in the adsorption capacity of the go cs composite for mb from 379 53 to 372 28 mg g as the temperature increased from 30 to 50 c this gradient occurs because the adsorptive force between the composite s adsorption sites and the dye molecules decreased at an elevated temperature moreover the removal efficiency of mb only decreased from 94 88 to 93 07 indicating that the go based adsorbents effectively remove dyes from textile effluent without significantly fluctuating to cause major failures conversely mustafa et al 120 noticed an increase in mb adsorption capacity from 370 37 to 476 19 mg g as the temperature rose from 25 to 55 c using zncl2 modified neem leaves powder the performance of this adsorbent in elevated temperatures indicates that the resultant adsorption process is endothermic 121 which is good for the pdw treatment 3 1 7 3 the effect of pollutant initial concentration adsorbent dosage normally an increase in the initial concentration of the pollutant increases the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent and decreases the adsorbate removal efficiency in this respect sanad et al 111 explained that the sites on each unit mass of the adsorbent progressively filled as a large number of dye molecules are exposed to them eventually the sites saturate resulting in a decrease in the removal efficiency moreover bryan et al 82 observed that as the dosage of the go cs adsorbent increased from 250 to 1250 mg l the mb removal efficiency increased from 94 88 to 99 36 while the adsorption capacity decreased from 379 53 to 79 49 mg g in this case most of the available adsorption sites at low dosage remain unoccupied even at higher dosage thus dropping the adsorption capacity 82 3 1 7 4 the effect of contact time it is vital to afford the adsorption process adequate time sufficient to take the process to sorption equilibrium 82 since contact time varies from process to process accurate determination of each adsorption batch process is necessary the earlier the contact time for a process to reach equilibrium the better this swift reaction saves cost and ensures a good turnaround time in practical application 122 in addition sanad et al 111 observed that the adsorption process of cv and acid red on the bif ben composite was rapid at the initial stage until it attained equilibrium at 60 min nevertheless the gradual reduction in the accessible adsorption sites on the adsorbent s surface might have contributed to the longer adsorption time 3 1 8 the mechanism of pollutant s adsorption the main pdw pollutants that have been remediated through adsorption technology are dyes metals and anions most dyes have aromatic rings which are rich in π electrons in addition they possess functional groups that are easily ionisable in solution also metal ions and anionic molecules can adsorb on surfaces with opposite charges therefore the adsorption technique leverages these properties and those of the adsorbents to decontaminate pdw fig 2a c summarise the various adsorption mechanisms expected in the treatment of pdw fig 2a elucidates the adsorption mechanisms of anionic and cationic aromatic dyes malachite green mg is typically protonated under low ph thus electrostatic attraction between the cationic adsorbent and mg is an unsuitable mechanism therefore surface complexation and π π interaction are the leading adsorption mechanisms 109 conversely electrostatic attraction surface complexation and π π interaction are the dominant mechanisms for the anionic cr and db5 dyes in fig 2b both electrostatic attraction and co adsorption mechanisms are in effect whereas in fig 2c all the enlisted mechanisms together with pore filling emerge as the mechanisms of adsorption overall all the adsorption mechanisms encountered in the reviewed articles are based on one or more of the presented mechanisms 3 2 membrane separation technologies the membrane technology has become an advanced separation technique for example in the textile industry for the treatment of printing and dyeing wastewater pdw in the membrane technological process the solution is passed through a porous membrane barrier 136 thus for pdw treatment it entails the passage of wastewater containing dyes salts divalent and monovalent cations and anions and other solutes through a porous membrane for removal usually dye molecules will be separated from the water because of the size or charge difference relative to the membrane generally larger dye molecules and those with similar charges as the membrane will be easily rejected also salts such as nacl mgcl2 and na2so4 may pass through the membrane while electropositive membranes tend to retain multivalent cations 137 membrane separation on the other hand has drawbacks such as high running costs and membrane fouling 138 despite its low rate of decomposition a non commodity for practical use efficiency and high toxicity the treatment feasibility of the biodegradation approach is restricted 34 139 membrane separation has a high operating and maintenance cost and the membrane is easily contaminated resulting in performance loss 37 43 44 although printing and dyeing wastewater contain complex pollutants most research dealing with membrane separations concentrates on dyes and salts removal with only a few additionally giving interest to the removal of cations turbidity conductivity chemical oxygen demand cod total organic carbon toc and anions already the high aromaticity and reduced reactivity of dyes make their biological and chemical degradation processes unfavourable conferring on membrane technology their effective separation approach 140 moreover in addition to the conventional membrane filtration techniques that consist of membrane materials such as polysulfone polydopamine and polypyrrole advanced integrated membrane filtration technologies have been recently popular in treating printing and dyeing wastewater based on the available literature nanocomposite membranes and membrane distillations are some advanced membrane based filtration technologies that have been widely applied in the textile industry evidently the integrated membrane systems show improvement in membrane properties derived from integrating the filtration properties of the membranes with extra functionalities such as stability porosity and enhanced surface area therefore we review membrane filtration technologies for pdw based on conventional membrane filtration microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf advanced integrated membrane techniques nanocomposite membranes membrane distillations and reverse forward osmosis ro fo notably various nanocomposite membrane techniques still fall under the identified membrane filtration methods 3 2 1 conventional membrane filtration techniques 3 2 1 1 microfiltration microfiltration is regarded as a low pressure separation process and mf membranes typically have pore sizes varying between 0 1 and 5 μm 141 ceramic mf membrane is suitable for treating real textile dye bath effluents because it offers simplicity of cleaning and regeneration high water permeability less fouling tendency superior mechanical and thermal stability and corrosion resistance 142 literature indicates that ceramic mf membranes showed a considerable removal efficiency to cod 25 colour 26 sulphates 34 tds 31 bod 39 turbidity 21 and chlorides 33 from textile effluents treatment study 142 in a more recent study a biopolymer keratin was used to functionalise an mf membrane composed of polyethyleneimine polyacrylonitrile pei pan materials 143 the neglected waste keratin showed great potential in functionalising conventional membranes to achieve 93 25 rejection of alizarin red in simulated textile wastewater importantly improvements are being made to mf processes by combining them with other separation processes such as coagulation flocculation 144 and anaerobic forward osmosis 145 in the case of using woven fiber microfiltration combined with fo to treat synthetic textile wastewater colour and cod removal reached 96 4 and 99 2 respectively 145 3 2 1 2 ultrafiltration ultrafiltration membranes are constructed to separate certain pollutant types from pdw wastewater by employing a pressure driven process 146 the applied pressure is lower than in nf and ro thus to remove multivalent cations that characterise most pdw micellar enhanced ultrafiltration and polymer enhanced ultrafiltration processes are applied the former being a reliable approach to metal ions removal 147 various recent research studies on the use of uf membrane process for the treatment of dyeing wastewater have used different single polymers such as polyethylenimine polydopamine and polypyrrole as well as combined polymer porous material e g polyvinylidene fluoride metal organic framework mof as membranes 148 150 cationic dyes such as methylene blue and crystal violet are satisfactory for dyeing acrylic fibres but typically possess smaller molecular weights and require positively charged membranes for separation 151 in this regard a tight ceramic uf membrane was fabricated and modified with aminosilane through grafting enhancing the membrane surface s positive charge the ceramic membrane s surface was covalently bonded to amino functional groups compensating for its surface charge weakness 151 besides electrostatic repulsion according to the donnan exclusion effect was instrumental in rejecting the cationic dyes since their low molecular weight supports the penetration of the porous membrane more so the results from the evaluation of simulated dyeing wastewater showed that the rejection of salts is in the order na2so4 mgso4 nacl mgcl2 this trend is explained by the more electrostatic repulsion of divalent metal in salts than the monovalent counterpart by the positive membrane regardless the so4 2 ion is shown to neutralise the cationic membrane resulting in a lower rejection than the na2so4 similarly the zeta potential 15 6 mv indicated a positive membrane and the rejection rates of methylene blue and basic green which are cationic dyes were 78 5 and 72 4 respectively 151 3 2 1 3 nanofiltration this is another pressure driven membrane separation process which falls in between reverse osmosis and ultrafiltration membrane processes nanofiltration technology is an important sought after separation technique for example in the textile industry for treating printing and dyeing wastewater for reuse already the tiny molecular size of the pollutants in dye laden wastewater which characterises textile wastewater makes the application of microfiltration and ultrafiltration technologies unsuitable besides the high molecular weight cutoff mwco of uf membranes restricts the achievement of adequate dye recovery 152 nevertheless there is exhaustive literature demonstrating the potential of nf membranes to remove dyes and inorganic salts from textile wastewater thus the removal of these pollutants and reuse of treated pdw creates a solution that will minimise operational costs in the textile industry 153 to achieve this goal there is a need for an improvement in the choice of nf membranes fabrication and functionalisation which are accomplished in integrated membrane techniques 3 2 2 advanced membrane based filtration technologies 3 2 2 1 nanocomposite membranes currently researchers are trying new materials composite fabricated by inserting small molecules or nanomaterials into other more stable materials or supports these nanocomposite membranes have shown great superiority over the traditional membranes in water and wastewater treatment imparting the desired porosity surface charge and contact angle for better rejection improved permeation and minimized fouling 140 154 155 thus in the treatment of simulated dyeing wastewater through sulphate radical enhancement liu et al 150 fabricated a zif 67 pvdf uf membrane through the nonsolvent induced phase separation technique the intercalated mof improved the membrane pore structure and enhanced sulphate radical generation through peroxymonosulfate pms activation this solution in design approach provided a self cleaning ability to the membrane fig 3a illustrates the mechanism of the pms anti fouling process which significantly increased the flux recovery the fabrication of membranes with enhanced antifouling performance is key in membrane technology especially for pdw treatment due to the likelihood of membrane fouling by dye molecules biochemicals and humic solutions 148 156 157 moreover the synthesized membrane efficiently removed some dye molecules including rhodamine b 90 5 methylene blue 98 2 and orange ii 97 3 more so in a more elaborate study for pdw treatment from a real textile plant different commercially available uf membranes mainly polyamide poly ether sulfone polysulfone and polyacrylonitrile were used 158 the molecular weight cut offs mwco of the uf membranes varied from 2 to 50 kda but the membrane with the lowest mwco i e polyamide performed better however comparative uf results in table 2 showed that the composite membrane removed 50 of all the investigated parameters including turbidity bod5 toc cod tnb so4 2 conductivity na k and ca2 interestingly the permeate was found apposite for washing dyed knitted cotton fabric producing the same quality of fabric as would textile clean water in addition colour removal efficiency increased from 93 in 1 h to 98 in 3 h furthermore a similar study on real textile pdw treatment applied halloysite nanoclay hnt doped with zro2 tio2 as a tight ultrafiltration ceramic membrane 159 ceramic membranes are low cost and readily available but their standalone practical application in pdw treatment has been limited because of their unsatisfactory thermal and chemical stability under harsh corrosive and aggressive conditions because of their sio2 and al2o3 components 160 on the other hand zro2 is a refractory material with sufficient thermal resistance and hydrophilicity suitable for pdw treatment thus zro2 doped hnt is expected to increase fluxes and minimise fouling 161 this combined performance of zro2 tio2 hnt was tested by ağtaş et al on three real wastewater samples from a textile company their results indicated that the toc removal efficiency varied from 3 to 43 the cod removal efficiency ranged between 5 and 55 while colour removal efficiency was in the range of 40 83 however when the temperature of the real wastewater was increased to 72 c the flux value increased from 4 5 to 10 l m2 h without significant change in the removal rates of the pollutants 159 another stable material used as substrate in composite membranes is graphene oxide go xiao et al 162 fabricated a new perylene 3 4 9 10 tetracarboxylic dianhydride modified zr mofs graphene oxide for pdw treatment the produced go ptcda uio 66 nh2 exhibited an excellent dye rejection close to 100 under a wide ph range elevated salt concentration and multiple recycling the composite membrane prepared through vacuum filtration self assembly is shown to have its intercalating materials ptcda and uio 66 nh2 grow like ropes on each other and link the go through a π π conjugation fig 3b besides uio 66 nh2 furnishes oh and nh2 that form electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bonding with the go s o2 containing functional groups thereby strengthening the stability of the composite more importantly the excellent dye rejection performance of the composite membrane see table 2 is linked to the electrostatic interaction size screening hydrogen bonding and π π stacking between the dye molecule and membrane components fig 3b another similar study that employed a go based membrane focused on fabricating an approximately 1 nm size wrinkled graphene go composite membrane 163 the idea was to screen dyes and salts with a larger size than 1 nm as depicted in fig 3c the wg go composite membrane exhibited high rejection rates for dyes crystal violet congo red and trypan blue of 1 nm while the sub nm sized dye molecules neutral red and methylene blue were poorly rejected moreover the higher rejection of na2so4 than nacl is attributable to the higher electrostatic repulsion between the composite membrane and so4 2 than with cl overall notwithstanding the possible electrostatic repulsion interference between the membrane surface and dyes the size controlled rejection approach through membrane surface modification is commendable in another recent study not only that a bimetallic mofs fecubdc material was inserted into a go nanosheet but also additional hydroxylated graphene goh was added to increase the composite membrane s interlayer and enhance the self cleaning catalytic degradation effort to reduce fouling 164 using acidic or oxidising solutions to clean membranes is likely to generate secondary pollution thus persulfate activation of the membrane to self clean online or offline is a desired membrane characteristic for industrial application although the vacuum filtration methods have been popular in fabricating mof based nf membranes 162 164 165 other techniques are being explored including nonsolvent induced phase separation 150 interfacial reaction and in situ self assembly reaction 166 film casting technique 167 and phase inversion technique 168 which is consistent with the quest for renewable nf membranes that possess satisfactory permeance and a high rejection rate for treating complex textile wastewater another membrane material that has enticed researchers interest due to its crystalline porous nature highly defined channels large surface area tunability and facilely tailored functionalities is covalent organic frameworks cofs 169 170 because of high salt concentrations embodying pdw that is already laden with dyes and other organic molecules cofs are being intercalated into various substrates for selective membrane nf processes specifically modifications that create electrostatic interactions between cofs membranes and dye molecules to intensify low molecular dye rejection and salt dye separation are a solution to the textile pdw treatment challenges in this regard sheng et al 169 fabricated a cationic cof membrane through an interfacial growth method they inserted 1 3 5 triformylphloroglucinol triaminoguanidinium chloride tptgcl a cof into a hydrolysed polyacrylonitrile hpan substrate the performance of this membrane suggests that the recovery and reuse of dyes from pdw are possible this was shown by the high rejection of mb dye and very low rejection of monovalent and divalent salts table 2 the tailoring of this membrane to permeate salts and reject dyes is unlike other cofs with high salt and dye rejections designed to generate clean water for reuse in the textile industry for instance tp polyamide cof intercalated into pan to form the tppa pan membrane demonstrated superior salt and dye rejections of 90 and 97 respectively 171 the prepared membrane possessed a negative surface charge thus creating electrostatic repulsion for the hydrated ions of the salts and the negatively charged dyes both steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion played useful roles in the separation for example the divalent hydrated ions so4 2 and mg2 were more hindered than their monovalent counterparts na and cl 1 whereas so4 2 was strongly repelled than cl 1 as a result the salt rejection trend was mgso4 na2so4 mgcl2 nacl the mechanism of separation for a similar cof is showcased in fig 4a where the cof tp tta mpsfx with a zeta potential of 36 mv could efficiently reject negatively charged dyes 172 however the rejection order of the dyes governed by their molecular weights suggests that the rejection was mainly determined by size exclusion the major difference between conventional nf and lnf is that the dense active layer of most nf membranes permits the simultaneous rejection of dyes and salts which is anti textile wastewater management 173 again lnf membranes have an extremely high water permeability high permeation of inorganic salts and superior dye retention efficiency which is a result of their loose structure besides physical size exclusion electrostatic interaction is a dominant factor on which the separation of nf membranes depends interestingly lnf membranes can be tailored to have enhanced negatively charged surfaces enabling the high rejection of dyes and excellent permeation of inorganic salt congruent with this notion kang et al 173 prepared a graphene oxide tannic acid nickel go ta ni lnf membrane the dye rejection was above 92 while the permeation of monovalent and divalent salts was 93 similarly ji et al 174 prepared a hollow fiber pvdf go ppy membrane with a multilayer structure therein the graphene oxide covers the interfacial pores of polyvinylidene fluoride while the membrane structure is decorated by polymerising polypyrrole on its surface fig 4b as a result the solvent free padding of the membrane increased the hydrophilicity enhanced electrostatic repulsion according to the donnan exclusion effect and improved rejections for negative dyes generally other superior polymers and polymer composites have been successfully utilised in the treatment of simulated and real dyeing wastewater table 2 provides a general overview of the various membrane technologies applied in recent times to treat wastewater from the textile industry these studies attempted to tackle the key issues in membrane filtration i e fouling stability and reusability of membranes in addition diverse optimisation techniques were put in place to enhance water permeability dye rejection salt permeation or rejection and the rejection of other solutes and organic materials nevertheless choosing appropriate monomers and monomer concentrations for membrane production is vital to reducing fouling tendencies the gap between pure water permeance and dye water permeance always indicates the appropriateness of the monomer selection for certain dyes to illustrate the decrease in resveratrol concentration in fabricating resveratrol tmc membrane from 0 4 wt to 0 1 or 0 2 wt resulted in dye cake layer formation and blockage of the membrane pores leading to severe membrane fouling and causing a reduced dye water permeance than when tested with pure water 175 this performance was due to the participation of only a fewer resveratrol monomer during the interfacial polymerisation process giving room for some dye molecules to partially diffuse into the membrane pores 3 2 2 2 membrane distillation membrane distillation md is a thermal membrane hybrid separation process its process permits the passage of only water vapour by a vapour pressure gradient through an extremely porous hydrophobic membrane 184 185 considering the zero liquid discharge strategy and no additional heating requirement in md technology because of an elevated temperature of dyeing wastewater it is considered a promising technology with energy efficient processes 186 moreover since the mild operating temperatures 50 80 c of the md process are congruent with the discharge temperature of the textile wastewater 187 it may serve as a cost effective separation process when merged with alternative energy sources although md separation technology basks in the merits of low applied pressure low operating temperatures and maximum dissolved ions rejection making it more advantageous over other desalination processes 188 the fabrication of enhanced hydrophobic membranes is a necessity to boost the wetting resistance of the membrane ordinarily the low applied pressure 0 15 bar in the dcmd process lowers the propensity of membrane fouling scaling thus the fouling tendency of the porous material for producing the membrane is linked to its hydrophobicity 187 moreover the outstanding interaction between the aromatic rings of the dye molecules and the membrane surface in dyeing and printing wastewater leads to increased fouling in the md process the differential vapour pressure between both sides of the membrane drives the vapours in the gas phase across the membrane 189 as such the inducement of the vapour pressure difference vpd is the basis of the various existing md configurations to illustrate in direct contact md dcmd vacuum md vmd air gas md agmd and sweeping gas md sgmd the vpd is induced by a temperature difference vacuum a temperature difference and flowing a low humidity gas respectively 189 193 in recent times several modifications have been made to these basic md configurations to enhance their effectiveness in purifying wastewater and desalination technology and they include vacuum membrane distillation crystallization 194 and vacuum enhanced air gap membrane distillation 195 among the above mentioned md processes dcmd continues to garner attraction for printing and dyeing wastewater treatment for being simply configured can generate high flux with adequate operating conditions no need for an external condenser and suits water based separations 185 196 however vdm promises minimal heat loss reduced concentration and temperature polarisation and enhanced permeate flux 190 nevertheless at varying degrees md processes suffer pore wetting as a result of feed water ingress into the membrane pores depreciation in vapour pressure due to temperature and concentration polarisation and membrane fouling caused by solid deposits on membrane pores leading to pore obstruction and flux reduction on long application 197 therefore to eliminate these drawbacks researchers are focusing on optimising membranes hydrophobicity membrane fabricating methods membrane cleaning strategies and using computational fluid dynamics simulations and statistical models such as response surface methodology rsm and artificial neural network to optimise process parameters and predict responses 190 198 to expatiate new strategies are now employed for enhancing the existing membrane materials and customising new ones to acquire superior hydrophobic porous properties adequate porosity and pore size and high permeability the enhancement of these membrane features is vital for the practical applications of md technology for printing and dyeing wastewater treatment various polymer materials including polytetrafluoroethylene polypropylene and polyvinylidene fluoride have been used as md membranes to enhance the performance of the separation technique more recently mixed matrix polymer membranes are being investigated huang et al 199 fabricated a metal organic framework zeolitic imidazolate framework 71 zif 71 incorporating it into poly vinylidene fluoride cohexafluoropropylene pch this composite zif 71 pch produced by electrospinning displayed an improved surface roughness and hydrophobicity for enhanced treatment of dyeing wastewater they reported a high dye rejection of approximately 100 for acid red acid yellow crystal violet and methylene blue dyes additionally a novel mof mil101 fe infused poly vinylidene fluoride co hexafluoropropylene pvdf hfp was studied for its dye removing ability from the textile industry wastewater 200 therein rsm was also applied in assessing the flow rate and feed temperature impacts on dye rejection and permeate flux to enable membrane performance optimisation as a result both the predicted flux 6 75 l m2 h dye rejection 98 14 and experimentally observed flux 6 66 l m2 h dye rejection 98 22 values showcase the advantages of the simultaneous rsm and dcmd use in textile wastewater treatment furthermore yadav et al 190 took advantage of the benefits of vdm and rsm for methyl orange dye removal from textile dyeing wastewater the optimised parameters from the rsm simulation were the input process parameters resulting in a high dye rejection of 99 81 and permeate flux of 19 60 l m2 h in addition the sem analysis of the used membrane provided evidence of less severe dye deposition made possible by high liquid entry pressure lep high pore wetting resistance and superior hydrophobicity of the ptfe membrane 190 more so the electrospinning technique for fabricating nanofibrous materials provided leeway to overcome the low permeation flux challenge of the traditional microporous md membranes it offers numerous benefits including controllable thickness low cost simple fabricating equipment and a variety of spinnable materials 199 201 in addition membranes of substantially high porosity 90 low mass intensity and a large surface to volume ratio have been generated using environmentally benign solvents while emitting less co2 and generating little waste 198 moreover research has shown that a zif pch membrane fabricated through a one step electrospinning approach effectively prohibited the membrane pores from wetting during dyeing wastewater treatment in dcmd operation 199 besides the fabricated membrane exhibited a high permeation flux attributable to its large pore size and porosity notwithstanding the positive offers of the electrospinning method its application has been successful in lab scale production of electrospun nanofibrous membranes rather than on a large scale the limitations in upscaling the use of electrospun membranes include elongated electrospinning time 8 24 h low fiber productivity and unavailability of low cost and easily assessable commercial polymers coupled with only a few practical applications for real hot dyeing wastewater treatment 202 however improved mass productivity of nanofibers can be achieved using the gas assisted electrospinning gae technique the concept here is to direct an inert gas stream e g dry air to exert a drag force on the polymer solvent jet and the taylor cone through the co axial nozzle to boost nanofiber productivity 187 fig 5a b show the schematic diagram of the conventional versus gas assisted electrospinning systems the gae spinneret is composed of double needles in the co axial configuration the gas stream passes through the outer needle 14g while the polymer solution is transferred through the inner needle 18g unlike the single tube needle that transfers only a few μl of the polymer solution per hour in the conventional electrospinning system the modified gae technique injects 135 μl min of the solution 187 more importantly it was reported that the technique exhibited a large nanofiber mass production rate than the conventional technique counterpart and was successfully applied in the treatment of real dyeing wastewater with almost 100 dye rejection rate and low pore wetting 187 furthermore regarding membrane cleaning strategies studies are taken advantage of nanoparticles that can simultaneously attach both porous and photocatalytic properties to the membrane material for the promotion of high flux and easy regeneration in this regard tio2 nanoparticle was incorporated into pvdf co hfp to produce a mixed matrix membrane mmm pvdf co hfp tio2 that displayed an outstanding photocatalytic property yadav et al 191 reported that the mmm completely regenerated dye fouled membranes under uv irradiation at 365 nm after 4 h at 1 h uv irradiation the flux of 4 7 kg m2 h approximately 80 of the flux at 4 h was achieved with no further observable flux change after 4 h from the preceding paragraphs it is obvious that enormous research is ongoing to overcome the shortcomings of the various md configurations interestingly these research endeavours are yielding commendable results as very recent literature is reporting the application of different md processes in dyeing wastewater treatment with successes table 3 presents some of the recent studies that applied md technology in the treatment of synthetic or actual dye wastewater from textile industries it is observed that the high dye rejection permeate flux and optimum pore size indicated by these studies is because of the various improvements made on either the membrane materials fabricating technique or the md configuration process 3 2 3 reverse forward osmosis reverse osmosis has found use in printing and dyeing wastewater treatment because of its effectiveness in removing inorganic and organic contaminants it is a high pressure driven process of filtration due to a narrower membrane pore size 0 5 nm compared to nf 203 reverse osmosis is essential for removing dissolved minerals contributing to the high conductivity of textile wastewater and for water recovery even after removing cod toc and colour by any of the chemical and biological processes 204 one pilot scale study on the use of ro for pdw treatment indicated high removal of conductivity from 5500 μs cm in the feed to 150 μs cm in the permeate with 70 water recovery 204 nevertheless a well known challenge in using ro for treating textile wastewater is membrane fouling fouling heightens the differential pressure between the feed and concentrate increases energy consumption elongates filtration time and may cause permanent damage to the membrane 205 on the other hand disc tube reverse osmosis dtro has been designed to discharge the concentrated liquid from the flange of the feed end this process helps in overcoming the ro challenge above and may advance future pdw treatment still the produced concentrate stream is rich in salt and other organic pollutants impeding its reuse presently dtro is being used in combination with other technologies for the effective treatment of pdw for instance jing et al 205 combined fenton oxidation low temperature crystallization and dtro to treat pdw for reuse in the textile industry furthermore forward osmosis a more energy saving separation method is gaining the attention of both researchers and industries fo is different from the conventional pressure driven membrane techniques as it applies differential osmotic pressure between the draw and feed solutions for its separation process thus unlike ro fo has found use in the textile industry for concentrating and recovering dyes from pdw to illustrate li et al 206 used a support free fo to concentrate and recover dyes from artificial pdw the applied membrane poly triazole co oxadiazole co hydrazine had excellent dye retention as the actual concentration of cr was 9 99 g l besides the membrane demonstrated a remarkable antifouling property showing a flux recovery ratio of 98 7 after regeneration in an alcohol solution furthermore apart from dyes other life threatening metals are applied in the textile industry for instance antimony sb compounds are used as a catalyst to fabricate polyester fiber and have been implicated in human carcinogenicity 207 based on the dire need to remove potentially toxic elements from pdw before discharging into the environment meng et al 207 implemented an fo technology for the removal of sb from real pdw fig 6 shows the fo schematic module and the likely mechanism of sb rejection by the aquaporin fo membrane here since the aquaporin membrane has a dense layer suitable for rejecting small ions such as k cl and na the larger hydrated ionic radius of sb was advantageous thus the rejection and retention of sb were a result of steric hindrance due to large hydrated sb ion and the donnan effect since the negatively charged aquaporin membrane and positively charged sb and other co existing ions could interact more importantly this fo process showed excellent sb rejection 99 7 proving the suitability of fo in removing sb from real pdw additionally other physical separation processes that have been applied in the treatment of printing and dyeing wastewater include coagulation ion exchange and flotation by colloidal gas aphrons cga cgas are a system of extremely stable micron sized bubbles 10 100 μm that possess large interfacial areas similar water flow properties can retain a charge identical to the surfactant solution and easily separate from a bulk liquid 208 recently dermiki et al 209 used cga in a flotation column to separate dye mixtures in different modes the authors reported that the electrostatic interaction between the dye molecules mb and mo and the surfactant stabilised microtubules the cga was the observed mechanism for mo recovery 70 9 similarly pal et al 208 used a natural surfactant extract from the tree ziziphus spina christi to prepare a cga for anionic and cationic dye removal from an aqueous solution their result indicated that the natural surfactant acceptably removed anionic and cationic dyes in a two step sequential flotation process that is the fresh cga initially removed about 79 of mb while the regenerated and reused cga removed an additional 37 of cr 4 advanced oxidation process for printing and dyeing wastewater there are two main categories of aops the photochemical and non photochemical aops the photochemical aops include photochemical oxidation using uv and catalyst use of uv h2o2 uv o3 uv o3 h2o2 photo fenton fe2 uv h2o2 the non photochemical aops include ozonation ozonation h2o2 fenton fenton h2o2 wet air oxidation electrochemical oxidation catalytic wet air oxidation before the interest in aops various technologies have been employed and previously reported for printing and dyeing effluent treatment they include adsorption technology filtration coagulation flocculation and biological treatment technologies these technologies have shown major set backs for example filtration suffers from fouling and high cost adsorption technologies suffer from long contact times with pollutant coagulation flocculation is inefficient against soluble dyes biological methods suffer from poor applicability at large scales 210 hence the alternative procedures to printing and dyeing effluent treatment is the advanced oxidation process aop sometimes the combined synergy between two or three aops are employed works better table 4 shows the mechanism of aops like fenton photochemical photocatalytic ozonolytic electrochemical and ultrasound aops while table 5 shows their strengths and weaknesses aops have attracted lots of interest because it generates highly reactive radical species in situ under ambient conditions of temperature and pressure these radical species attack organic moieties in dye effluents through hydrogen abstraction electron transfer and radical addition 211 consequently no matter the method or mechanism of attack the radical scavenges the organic moieties non selectively and rapidly at rates as high as 106 109 m 1 s 1 211 the first method of effluent treatment aops is the ozonation processes this involves a direct or indirect attack of effluent species using ozone o3 the efficacy of this treatment technology depends largely on ph level under acidic ph ozone attacks organic moieties in dyes and inks as electrophile while under basic ph ozone reacts rapidly with oh to yield ho 212 ozone can be coupled with h2o2 peroxonation or coupled with other catalysts catalytic ozonation when coupled with transition metal ions it is homogenous catalytic ozonation 213 and when coupled with metal oxides it is heterogeneous 214 a previous industrial research investigated ozone decolourisation treatment of printing ink wastewater and obtained decolourisation removal of 91 at ozone concentration of 11 mg l 215 baban et al reported the ozonation of printed wool effluents and obtained a decolourisation efficiency of 99 after 40 min of ozonation with absorption rate of 58 mg l 216 it has even been established that catalytic ozonation converts non biodegradable dye effluents to biodegradable forms turhan ozturkcan 217 investigated this phenomenon for reactive orange 16 dye effluents and its biodegradability after ozonation treatment the major parameters that influence ozonation of inks and dye effluents are ph ozone dose and concentration of catalyst 218 alkaline ph is the best for ozonation since high level of reactive oh radicals are released at this ph turhan et al reported cod removal of direct dye in effluents increased from 23 to 65 with ph increase from 6 to 12 219 muthukumar et al reported 64 cod removal in acid red 88 effluent when ph increased from 3 to 11 219 khadhraovi et al reported higher treatment efficiency with o3 h2o2 than ozone treatment alone 220 the optimal molar ratio reported in this treatment is 1 45 the disadvantage of using ozone is that it generates toxic and carcinogenic compounds after treatment in other works 25 cod removal was achieved for a printed textile effluent using mnfe2o4 in a catalytic ozonation treatment also direct red 80 was decolourised up to 94 and cod removal was 43 using o3 h2o2 ratio of 1 100 221 222 another very powerful aop for printing and dyeing effluent treatment is the photochemical aop this aop involves treatment of effluents using uv absorption since most dye molecules are photoactive they can absorb uv to reach excited state leading to bond rupture uv o3 photochemical aop in preferred to uv h2o2 the molar absorption coefficient of o3 is 200 times higher than that of h2o2 223 however the use of uv s2o8 2 uv ps and uv hso5 uv pms can significantly remove dye effluents than uv o3 in uv ps and uv pms show high redox potential than uv oh the major parameters that affect photochemical aop is uv light intensity oxidant concentration ph and the kind of water sample low pressure uv lights have been the most frequently used and effective for photochemical aop while the oxidant concentration must not be too high at very high concentration of oxidant the radicals generated tend to scavenge themselves leading to a lower effluent removal rate 224 aleboyeh et al shows that treatment with uv h2o2 for azo dye after 25 min achieved 99 decolourisation and after 120 min toc removal of 95 was achieved 225 direct red 80 was decolourised up to 94 and cod removal was 43 using o3 h2o2 ratio of 1 to 100 221 shu 226 achieved 80 decolourisation within 30 min with direct blue 199 using uv h2o2 the photocatalytic method of inks and dyes wastewater treatment involves the generation of radicals from solid catalysts by the process irradiation photo excitation occurs when the absorbed uv photons have an energy equal to or greater than the semiconductor energy gap in the photocatalyst see fig 7 photo excitation in photocatalysis releases radicals through water ionisation oxygen ionosorption superoxide protonation etc all generating oh radicals 227 228 photocatalysis depends on parameters like catalyst type and irradiation source various photocatalysts like tio2 zno wo3 have been employed doped catalysts like tio2 zno tio2 sio2 srtio3 ceo2 have also been used 229 230 arcanjo et al 231 reported photocatalytic treatment of textile mill effluents using hydrotalcite fe2o3 tio2 under uv achieved 96 removal than unmodified tio2 88 at ph 10 and 2 g l dosage photocatalysis is more stable at ambient but has low quantum efficiency and suffers from mass transfer limitations at catalyst interphases 232 the fenton process generates lots of oh when fe2 and h2o2 are mixed together photo fenton and electro fenton are even more efficient at decolourising and mineralising of inks and dyes fenton processes depends heavily on ph and fenton dose a low ph of 3 works best for fenton at high ph concentrations of fe3 reduces by precipitation into fe oh 3 hence prevent the generation of more fe2 from fe3 reduction 233 patel et al employed treated reactive red 241 wastewater through fenton at ph 4 7 and 10 234 pazdior et al reported an optimum dose of 0 8 g h2o2 and 0 06 g fe2 235 ribeiro et al achieved 65 cod removal when mass ratio of cod h2o2 fe3 is 1 2 2 236 other works includes use of cu2cl oh 3 nanoflowers to achieve 98 decolourisation of rhodamine b dye 237 photo fenton oxidation was carried out on methylene blue using feooh bi2wo6 and a decolourisation efficiency of 98 was obtained 238 ma xia 239 treated printing effluents by sequential fenton oxidation and coagulation for 30 min at ph of 4 with 50 mg l h2o2 and 25 mg l fe2 yielded 80 92 46 colour removal cod and solids removal zhang et al employed fenton action and adsorption to treat lithographic ink wastewaters they achieved 90 colour removal but 50 cod removal ma xia 239 used uv fenton to treat ink wastewater from circuit board products with cod removal of 92 chua loh 240 combined ultrasound and fenton showing 81 colour removal and an activation energy of 18 2 kj mol catalytic wet air oxidation is a green and friendly aop for treating dyes and inks in waste water it employs air oxygen at high pressure over 20 mpa and high temperature over 200 c to oxidize dyes and ink based pollutants into nh3 co2 and dissolved simple salts however in the presence of catalysts higher efficiency can be reached at much lower temperature and pressure 241 244 ternary fe2o3 ceo2 tio2 immobilized on alumina in wet air oxidation achieved 98 colour removal and 96 toc removal for methyl orange within 2 h 243 zhang et al 245 applied zinc based polyoxometalates zn1 5pmo12o40 for the catalytic wet air oxidation of safranin t 98 colour removal 92 toc elimination and 95 cod elimination was achieved in 1 h 245 wet peroxide oxidation method as reported by kondru et al achieved 100 colour removal and 58 cod removal in 4 h the optimum conditions for the reaction ph 7 0 6 ml h2o2 1 g l zeolite catalyst 246 the wet peroxide oxidation appeared to be better than the wet air oxidation in terms of colour removal however the wet air oxidation achieved higher toc and cod elimination than the wet peroxide oxidation other advanced catalytic wet oxidation methods include the oxidation of dye mixtures use of noble metals supported on mixed metal matrices like mgal mgce and other processes that involves the optimization of gas flow flow rates and other flow parameters 247 ma xia 239 reported the oxidation of a binary dye mixture containing methyl orange and methyl blue using cuomoo3 p2o5 under atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature 99 colour removal was obtained for initial dosage of 0 3 g l electrochemical oxidation is very efficient for printing ink treatment it is versatile stable and cost ok in this method suitable voltages are applied on the electrode surfaces resulting in production of electrons on the electrode surface to break down heavy printing inks 248 the mechanism proceeds via a direct or indirect route direct mechanism exists on the anode and indirect on the cathode or other areas far from anode side with production of electrons through faradaic reactions 249 in the indirect mechanism electrons are produced in other areas in the cell through electrolysis and water splitting 250 rajkumar kim 251 performed electrochemical treatment experiments on reactive inks they employed dimensionally stable titanium electrode anode to achieve 83 and 45 cod and toc reduction at a current density of 72 ma cm2 and a supporting electrolyte concentration of 4 g l nacl in 120 min 251 jović et al 252 employed electrochemical oxidation to treat reactive blue 52 black 5 green 15 yellow 125 using a platinum electrode and 0 1 m na2so4 supporting electrolyte voltages of 6 12 and 24 v were varied 12 v performed best and gave a percentage colour removal of 58 after 1 h 252 morsi et al 249 achieved 100 ink colour removal using pbo2 anode at a current density of 20 macm 2 najafpoor et al 253 carried out a capacitive oxidative technique to decolorize red 120 using graphitic carbon anodes and a cellulosic separator papadopoulos et al 254 used an up scaled electrocoagulation technique to treat a printing ink with cod concentration as high as 2500 mg l initial cod from a paper packaging industry the reaction conditions investigated were ph 5 10 voltage 5 40 v mixing rate 0 400 rpm electrolyte concentration 0 05 0 40 g l alumina plate electrodes 1 5 cm distance current densities 2 8 ma cm2 94 colour removal 90 cod elimination 81 removal of copper turbidity who achieved in the offset printing wastewater the electrochemical method can be effective on thicker printing waste effluents 254 diamadopoulos et al 255 employed boron doped diamond anode to achieve 100 removal of effluent turbidity in the presence of lime as a precipitating agent but only 20 cod decrease however in the presence of alum a coagulating agent higher cod removal 60 was obtained the efficiency increased with higher applied currents under alkaline conditions 255 5 biological treatment the biological treatment approach is believed to be a cheap environmentally responsible and economically viable way to degrade wastewater particularly wastewater that contains colours 256 due to its genetic diversity and flexibility it has developed into a novel therapeutic option for the problem of coloured water contaminants such as salts carbon dioxide and rubbish can be converted into inorganic substances by biological materials the dye degradation is performed by using metabolic pathways or adsorption which makes use of both living and dead biomass including bacteria fungi yeasts algae and plants as shown in table 6 257 the biological technique only removes the dissolved material from textile wastewater the ratio of organic load dye to microbial load system temperature and oxygen content are all factors that affect removal effectiveness according to how much oxygen they require several biological processes can be categorised 258 5 1 under aerobic conditions under aerobic circumstances particular enzymes the majority of which are azo reductases catalyse dye degradation in large part when azo reductase and other substances are present some aerobic microbes may degrade dyes and then develop intermediate metabolites i e aromatic nh2 that are decomposed by microorganisms in the presence of oxygen to accomplish the entire mineralisation of azo dyes alizarin yellow r ay degradation was investigated by liang et al 274 utilising a hybrid strategy of fe carbon micro electrolysis as well as aerobic oxidation the final effluent s ay degrading efficiency was 96 5 the removal rates of total organic carbon toc were 69 86 and 79 44 respectively 5 2 under anaerobic conditions based on similar findings azo dyes can be successfully decoloured at a redox potential of 50 mv when used in anaerobic environments a colourless odourless and poisonous intermediate metabolite of aromatic amines which is frequently mineralised under aerobic circumstances is produced when the chromophore groups of dyes are broken apart furthermore it has been observed that aerobic respiration may dominate nadh usage and hinder the transport of electrons from nadh to the azo bond which generally lowers the reduction activity of the azo bond in the presence of oxygen additionally it has been noted that anaerobic circumstances might lead to the mineralisation of aromatic nh2 with functional hydroxyl and carboxyl groups anaerobic circumstances can lead to the degradation of some aromatic amines that are prone to self oxidation according to cao et al 275 the reactive brilliant red x 3b rbrx 3b dye in eams had a degradation efficiency that was 10 greater than the combined degradation efficiency of ms 61 9 and ecs 27 1 rbrx 3b degradation might be accelerated by the eams which combines an electrochemical system with an anaerobic microbial system rbrx 3b was converted into poisonous and harmless hydrocarbons in eams to completely mineralise the dye different bacterial strains require organic carbon as a source of energy for their growth according to palanivelan et al 276 however some bacteria that use the azo complex as a carbon source have also been observed to be able to survive on it 277 5 3 bacterial biodegradation of dyes prior studies on the microbial degradation of wastewater in recent years have primarily focused on developing a wide variety of superior decolourisation strains for the degradation and adsorption of dyes in wastewater as well as the development of efficient engineering bacteria and other improved technologies therefore it is crucial to comprehend how various microorganisms decolourize and degrade in order to provide a favourable environment for microorganisms the decolourisation impact of the electroactive bacteria shewanella oneidensis mr 1 on the azo dye cationic red x grl was investigated by li et al 278 s oneidensis mr 1 showed a greater capacity for decolourising x grl under ideal anaerobic circumstances ph 5 0 8 5 25 45 c and reaction duration of 12 h bacillus circulans bwl1061 a recently discovered strain that is salt tolerant was investigated by liu et al 279 for its ability to decolourise methyl orange the outcomes revealed that the breakdown of methyl orange by bwl1061 required the recent isolated salt tolerant strain nadh dcip reductase azo reductase and laccase the strain bwl1061 may also break down aromatic amines lessening the dye s toxicity in the process a salt tolerant yeast strain called g1 was discovered by song et al 280 who also tested the organism s ability to decolourise different azo dyes including acid red b arb under ideal circumstances the intermediate aromatic amines may be further mineralised and the decolourisation rate of 50 mg l of arb within 16 h was up to 98 the essential decolourisation reductase was found to be nadh dcip reductase such as klebsiella pneumonia enterococcs sp and escherichia coli also showed promising decolourising efficiency on diverse colours to address the environmental issues facing business future research must focus on this crucial area of microbial studies 281 5 4 algal biodegradation of dyes algae are commonly found in both freshwater and saltwater and they are currently the subject of intense research as a bio sorbent algae have the highest bio sorption potential and electrostatic force of attraction for pollutants in wastewater due to their huge surface area and binding capacity 281 algae are primary producers and their cell walls include functional groups including hydroxyl carboxylate amino and phosphate which are important for eliminating contaminants from aqueous solutions 282 based on the colour and colloid content they are divided into categories there are three different forms of marine algae brown red and green because they are common in nature marine algae are used as a source alginate carrageenan and polycolliod are the three main polysaccharides found in algae algae performance and selection are influenced by biosorption affinity and capacity 257 algae are everywhere and are receiving more attention in the field of degrading textile wastewater several types of algae have been employed effectively 258 algal decolourisation of the dye has three distinct methods algae employ chromophores to gather algal biomass co2 and water next they use the chromophores to convert chromophore material into non chromophore material finally they adsorb the resulting chromophore onto the algal biomass according to some studies certain algae species including cosmarium sp ulva lactuca sargassum spirogyra rhizopus pithophora sp nostoc muscorum spirogyra rhizopus and chlorella pyrenoidosa used for acid red 247 and methylene blue desmodesmus sp are efficient at breaking down azo dye according to other studies several types of algae use azo dyes as a source of c and n for growth 281 5 5 fungal biodegradation of dyes various fungus species have been identified and tested for cleaning the effluent outflow from dyeing industries for the biological breakdown of textile colours many bacteria have combined aerobic and anaerobic treatment with encouraging results 283 an effective remediation method for treating textile paper and pulp industry effluent that contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is phanerochaete chrysosporium pah phanerocheate chrysosporium which generates enzymes like laccase lignin and nganese peroxidase that promote the decolourisation of different dyes was examined by senthilkumar et al 284 another fungus trichoderma harzianum which has been used to clean the effluent from the textile sector was investigated by singh and singh 285 bromophenol blue was discovered to have the greatest inhibitory effect 43 a variety of fungal cultures were utilised for bioremediation because they have characteristics like rapid growth a lot of biomass and a wide range of hyphal colours that made them more efficient than bacteria 286 due to their high surface to cell ratio filamentous fungi were mentioned by joutey et al 287 as an efficient degrader in a specific environment aspergillus strain mmf3 and optimization of nacl for the efficient degradation of textile colour orange 3r singh et al 288 achieved 96 efficiency on the fifth day under ideal circumstances a concentration of 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 nacl resulted in further drops of 56 44 and 42 respectively for all trials carried out at varying nacl concentrations the greatest colour loss was seen on the fifth day this fungus strain attracted interest in the biological treatment of dyeing mill effluents due to its great decolourisation capacity and capacity to function in unfavourable settings verma et al 289 marine derived fungi have the ability to break down the anthraquinone dye reactive blue 4 and can also be used in bioremediation processes the two step degradation process begins with the partial treatment of pure laccase and ends with chemicals with low molecular weight through an enzymatic process the findings showed a 29 decrease in total carbon and a 20 decrease in toxicity using the laccase enzyme obtained from trametes polyzona strain wr710 1 chairin et al 290 investigated the decolourisation and deprivation of bisphenol a and other synthetic dyes anthraquinone dye reactive blue 4 that underwent laccase treatment saw roughly 61 decolourisation and saw a two fold reduction in cod in 12 h the biodegradation of wattle extract and other synthetic colours has been extensively researched using a variety of fungal cultures including penicillium sp and aspergillus niger 291 5 6 enzyme s biodegradation of dyes enzymes are the most effective molecules for speedily assisting the sequential breakdown and destruction of complicated substances unspecific cytoplasmic enzymes that function like azoreductases have been found in the cytoplasm of several bacterial species on the other hand a number of oxidoreductive enzymes including laccases azoreductases manganese peroxidases and lignin peroxidases are known to take part in the breakdown of dyes for the purpose of degrading azo dyes without producing hazardous aromatic amines the laccase enzyme uses a non specific free radical mechanism trametes versicolor was able to decolourise orange g azo dye by 97 292 by using the laccase enzyme pseudomonas desmolyticum strain ncim 2112 to completely degrade dyes like direct blue 6 and red he7b kalme et al 293 achieved effective results 6 future perspectives there is no doubt that the efforts of various researchers have focused on the study of the treatment of pdw to a considerable height however based on the review of literature some research gaps were observed which would be necessary for the improvement of this research area the high concentration of colouring matter and other contaminants in pdw poses a challenge to the environment and humans therefore the improvement of the treatment technologies at the various unit operations can maximise the efforts at curtailing this menace product recovery from the waste stream optimisation of printing and dyeing processes to curtail the use of extra water related contaminants optimisation of treatment technologies to improve efficiency and save cost and the adoption of zero liquid and waste discharge from the process which ensures that a minimal volume of fresh water is utilised in the process should be considered future studies should ensure that futuristic treatment methods strike a balance between being environmentally friendly efficient and cost effective the biological technique which is the conventional way of treating pdw is insufficient for removing several recalcitrant and persistent contaminants this is brought on by pdw s substantial refractory content furthermore the issues of high sludge production low toxic load tolerance and organic shock combined with a slow degradation rate persist one of the most feasible ways to overcome these shortcomings is the utilization of advanced integration systems which have shown improved abilities for treating wastewaters such as pdw due to their high efficiency and low operation cost however there has yet to be any study in literature that utilizes such a system studies involving the use of integrated systems that involve more than one of these treatment technologies such as integrated ceramic membrane with ultrafiltration system integrated microfiltration process with heterogeneous photocatalytic system and integrated biological biofilm and ozonation system should be encouraged furthermore to ensure the long term stability and operation of these technologies process parameters should be tuned at the lab and pilot scale and life cycle impact and cost benefit analyses should be performed to demonstrate the usefulness of hybrid technologies at the industrial scale it has been observed that the treatment technologies have been paying more emphasis on the removal and degradation of cationic dyes especially methylene blue with less attention being paid to the removal and degradation of anionic and non ionic dyes in addition the use of adsorption by various researchers has been centred on the removal of dyes and toxic heavy metals from pdw however less attention has been paid to the effect of the process on other parameters such as phosphate chloride and sulphate concentration turbidity colour cod and bod 7 conclusion in this study the authors reviewed various technologies that have been applied for the treatment of pdw and their strengths and weaknesses pdw is the aqueous effluent released by factories that operate the dyeing and finishing of wool and silk among other things this is the first study that discusses various treatment technologies that have been utilised for the treatment of pdw the treatment technologies utilised for treating pdw include physical based techniques such as adsorption and membrane technology chemical based techniques such as advanced oxidation processes aops and biological processes physico chemical treatment is frequently used to treat pdw but it is either not cost effective or cannot be utilised in large scale due to the large volume of wastewater involved even though the adsorption technique is efficient for the removal of dyes relatively simple user friendly and cost effective with a removal efficiency of 80 it is best suited for low concentration pdw it suffers from a long contact time with the pollutant membrane technology on the other hand is known for its minimal energy usage operation at room temperature and simplicity of operation with a rejection rate of 90 however high running costs and membrane fouling are some of its drawbacks aops that have been utilised for the degradation of pollutants in pdw include fenton photochemical photocatalytic electrochemical and ultrasound aops these processes are green sustainable and simple to use and operate however its major drawback is the change in the characteristics of molecules in the system or the production of free radicals which could have unfavourable consequences the biological technique which is the conventional way of treating pdw and utilizes micro organisms such as algae fungi enzymes and bacteria is insufficient for removing several recalcitrant and persistent contaminants this is brought on by pdw s substantial refractory content furthermore the issues of high sludge production low toxic load tolerance and organic shock combined with a slow degradation rate persist from the study it was observed that advanced oxidation processes is the most viable technique for pdw treatment due to its simplicity efficiency scalability and from the economic point of view to be sustainable pdw treatment technologies should strike a balance between being environmentally

12769,in this study electrocoagulation ec a green and efficient water treatment technology was used to improve the performance of the litopenaeus vannamei l vannamei ras the main objective was to investigate the nitrogen migration law of the innovative l vannamei ras establish a nitrogen recovery strategy and promote the sustainable development of the l vannamei ras it was found that 34 22 of input nitrogen n input accumulated in live shrimp 3 83 and 0 69 of n input existed in shed shrimp shell and dead shrimp 41 31 of n input was removed by the water treatment equipment 9 75 of n input was removed through water exchange and 2 89 of n input accumulated in the ras under the action of the ec the removal of nitrogen by a microscreen drum filter mdf moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr and foam separator fs increased by 26 39 9 52 and 9 10 respectively moreover a chlorella vulgaris culture system was used to recycle the waste nitrogen of the l vannamei ras with a nitrogen recovery rate of 80 84 these findings indicate that ec can significantly enhance the nitrogen removal of ras and the chlorella vulgaris can be used for the efficient recovery of the waste nitrogen from ras graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords recirculating aquaculture system electrocoagulation nitrogen budget nitrogen recycling energy consumption data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction nitrogen is one of the restrictive elements in ecosystems playing an important role not only in substance recycling and energy flow but also in ecological destruction 1 therefore in modern agriculture especially aquaculture scientific introduction of nitrogen is necessary to achieve economic production and prevent environmental pollution 1 2 litopenaeus vannamei l vannamei is an extremely important species in the aquaculture industry providing humans with a large amount of high quality proteins 3 in the conventional extensive shrimp culture model about 23 31 of n in feed is assimilated by shrimp and around 70 of nitrogen in feed enters the environment with sewage or is deposited in the bottom mud causing an environmental crisis 3 5 at present recirculating aquaculture systems rass have been used in l vannamei breeding due to the advantages of small footprint water saving controllability high yield and eco friendliness 3 6 7 the sewage generated during breeding in the ras is reused after purification with a water reuse rate of 90 which greatly reduces the discharge of nitrogen 8 improving the water treatment efficiency in the ras to reduce the daily water exchange rate can further reduce nitrogen emission during aquaculture which is of great significance in environmental protection total suspended solids tss produced during aquaculture contain abundant nitrogen that can be released into the aquaculture water so the effective management of tss is extremely important 9 in the ras the removal of tss mainly relies on the solid liquid separation equipment such as the microscreen drum filter mdf and foam separator fs 10 adding flocculants into aquaculture water before filtration can increase the particle size of tss thereby improving the water treatment efficiency of the solid liquid separation equipment in the ras and reducing nitrogen content and water exchange in the ras 9 11 compared with chemical flocculation electrocoagulation ec has attracted more attention as it is environmentally friendly has higher efficiency more controllability easier operation and lower sludge output 12 although ec technology has been widely used in the field of water treatment its application in rass is rarely reported in our recent study ec technology was first applied to the l vannamei ras by constructing a coupling technology of the electrocoagulation reactor ecr and mdf and it was found that the removal efficiency of tss chemical oxygen demand cod and total ammonia nitrogen tan in the ras was increased by 24 07 24 30 and 8 94 respectively 13 the nitrogen budget and recycling are important means of evaluating the sustainability of the ras 3 however the potential of the ec technology in the ras nitrogen budget has not been explored besides some challenges in the sustainability of ras such as the nitrogen recycling strategy of residual bait feces and aquaculture tail water remain unresolved therefore the main purpose of this study was to determine the nitrogen budget law in the innovative l vannamei ras with an ecr to establish a nitrogen recycling strategy for ras solid wastes and aquaculture tail water and to promote the sustainable development of the ras for this purpose the utilization migration transformation and accumulation of input nitrogen n input in the l vannamei ras between aquaculture objects and each water treatment unit were investigated and the effect of ec technology on the nitrogen budget was analyzed in addition the application of chlorella vulgaris in nitrogen recovery from ras solid waste and aquaculture tail water was studied the obtained results could provide guidance for the precise design and construction of the l vannamei ras optimization of

the ecr i ecr was feedback controlled by the backwashing interval period of the mdf t mdf in the ras the t mdf decreased when the tss concentration in the aquaculture water increased 10 when the concentration of tss increased the working current of the ecr i ecr needed to rise to generate more flocculants improving the water treatment efficiency of the ras when the t mdf decreased the i ecr rose through the central control system of the ras otherwise the i ecr was reduced the ecr mdf linkage control system had a working cycle of 3 h in which the first 2 h were used to calculate the t mdf and the third hour was used to adjust the i ecr based on the t mdf the relationship between the i ecr a and t mdf s was as follows i ecr 3217 86t mdf 1 262 1 66 q φ where q l s was the flow in the ras

tn in aquaculture water was removed by the ecr mdf mbbr and fs fig 2a with an increase in the breeding period the tn ssn and dn in the ap effluent were raised from 19 56 0 17 0 52 0 05 and 19 04 0 18 mg l to 30 59 0 59 1 54 0 05 and 28 12 0 14 mg l respectively the concentration of ssn in aquaculture water was much lower than that of dn and this was because the removal of ssn by the water treatment unit in the ras was much higher than the removal of dn fig 2b c specifically the average daily removal of ssn by the mdf mbbr and fs was 345 65 47 16 and 120 80 g d respectively and the average daily removal of ssn by the ras was 466 45 g d fig 2b moreover it was found that the concentration of ssn in the effluent of the mbbr was higher than that in the influent fig 2b which was caused by replacement of the biofilm in the mbbr 13 17 during the 28 day experiment the total removal of ssn by the mdf mbbr fs and ras was 9 68 1 32 3 38 and 13 06 kg respectively in comparison the average daily removal of dn by the ecr mbbr and fs was 16 42 156 30 and 15 53 g d respectively and the average daily removal of dn by the ras was 188 25 g d fig 2c during the 28 day experiment the total removal of dn by the ecr mbbr fs and ras was 0 46 4 38 0 43 and 5 27 kg respectively obviously the dn in aquaculture water was mainly removed in the mbbr while ssn was mainly removed by the mdf and fs overall during the experiment the amounts of nitrogen removal by the ecr mdf mbbr and fs were 0 46 9 68 3 06 and 3 81 kg respectively as shown in table 1 on the 28th and 32nd day the backwashing times of the mdf the filter residue dry weight and the nitrogen content of the mdf filter residue were 437 and 404 times d 20 73 1 46 and 17 94 0 98 g times 5 02 0 42 and 4 97 0 21 respectively the scum dry weight of the fs and nitrogen content in fs scum were 40 25 1 26 and 37 53 0 53 g h and 11 22 0 21 and 10 95 0 35 respectively the c tn in the influent and effluent of the mbbr were 29 94 and 29 73 mg l and 31 76 and 31 76 mg l and the nitrogen removal amounts were 189 and 171 g d respectively the iron based flocculants produced by the ecr can improve the water treatment capacity of subsequent water treatment units 13 18 significantly the ecr not only increased the dry weight of the mdf filter residue and fs scum but also increased the content of nitrogen in the mdf filter residue and fs scum under the action of the ecr nitrogen removal by the mdf mbbr and fs increased by 26 39 9 52 and 9 10 respectively 3 2 changes in tan no2 n and no3 n in the ras tan and no2 n are significant indicators that receive attention during aquaculture and can threaten the health of breeding species 13 with an increase in the experimental period tan and no2 n in the ap effluent increased from 0 439 0 012 and 0 055 0 001 mg l to 0 662 0 009 and 0 098 0 02 mg l fig 3a b and increased by 0 223 and 0 043 mg l respectively the average concentrations of tan and no2 n in the effluent of the ap ecr mbbr and fs were 0 578 and 0 073 mg l 0 572 and 0 073 mg l 0 420 and 0 050 mg l and 0 380 and 0 048 mg l respectively the removal efficiency of tan and no2 n by the ecr mbbr and fs was 1 00 and 0 26 30 and 31 51 and 6 92 and 2 74 respectively in the ecr active oxidizing substances are produced during ec which can degrade tan and no2 n 13 14 in this experiment the removal effect of the ecr on tan and no2 n was not obvious due to the large inlet flow in the ecr in a previous study xu et al 11 investigated the removal efficiencies of tan and no2 n by the ecr fe was used as the anode the influent flow was 67 l h and the current was 1 23 a which were 63 19 1 69 and 67 42 3 47 respectively as expected the mbbr was the major processing unit in the degradation of tan and no2 n 8 significantly the fs removed part of tan and no2 n which was mainly due to the oxidation of ozone ozone can degrade organic matter eliminate pathogenic bacteria and control the concentration of tan and no2 n 10 however the addition amount of ozone should be carefully controlled preferably 20 g ozone kg feed day 1 19 in this study the addition amount of ozone was about 12 8 g ozone kg feed day 1 which may be attributed to the enhanced water treatment capacity of mdf and mbbr by ecr in the ras tan and no2 n with high toxicity are transformed into no3 n with less toxicity under the action of microorganisms 8 with an increase in the experimental period the concentration of no3 n in the ap effluent increased from 16 725 0 065 mg l to 18 760 0 139 mg l fig 3c an increase of 2 04 mg l during the experiment the average concentration of no3 n in the effluent of the ap ecr mbbr and fs was 17 691 17 675 17 775 and 17 817 mg l respectively the concentration of no3 n in aquaculture water decreased slightly after ecr treatment but increased after mbbr and fs treatment the ecr can remove no3 n in the aquaculture water through electro reduction 11 moreover due to the presence of sufficient dissolved oxygen in the ras denitrification in the ras was weak leading to the accumulation of no3 n 8 3 3 shrimp growth performance the growth of aquaculture species is an important indicator and reflects the feasibility of the novel ras as shown in table 2 the daily growth rates of l vannamei body length and weight were 0 13 cm d and 0 21 g d respectively after 28 days of culture the density of the live shrimp increased from 1 90 kg m3 to 6 75 kg m3 and live biomass increased by 436 50 kg during the experiment the number and wet weight of dead shrimp were approximately 1600 and 9 5 kg and the survival rate was 97 87 a higher growth and survival rate proved that the new ras was feasible for the culture of l vannamei moreover during the experiment the biomass of the shrimp live and dead shrimp increased by 446 0 kg wet weight and the fcr was 1 2 a study by chaikaew et al 20 found that when the feeding frequency of l vannamei increased from 2 times d to 6 times d the fcr decreased from 2 6 to 1 8 the lower residual bait rate and fcr can improve the effective utilization of nitrogen 21 which was attributed to the automatic bait throwing machine and the excellent water quality environment in this study 3 4 nitrogen budget 3 4 1 nitrogen budget of l vannamei as shown in table 3 during the experiment a total of 520 54 kg of the bait with a nitrogen content of 6 72 0 15 was delivered in the ras of which n input was 34 98 kg 494 50 kg of the bait was eaten by the shrimp during breeding of which the nitrogen content was 33 23 kg n feeding 30 40 kg of residual bait was produced during the experiment and the amount of nitrogen in the residual bait was 1 75 kg n residual bait accounting for 5 of the n input moreover the n harvest and n dead shrimp were 11 97 and 0 25 kg respectively a total of 20 34 kg dry weight shrimp shells were shed during the 28 day growth period and the nitrogen content was 6 58 0 15 1 34 kg as shown in section 3 1 the amount of dn and ssn removed by the water treatment unit in the ras was 5 27 and 13 06 kg respectively based on eqs 13 14 and table 3 the amount of n dn and n ssn produced was 9 41 kg and 13 34 kg during the experiment and the ratio was 1 1 42 in the report by chaikaew et al 20 the ratio of n dn to n ssn was about 1 1 3 and was 1 0 98 in the study by de melo filho et al 22 the residual bait and feces produced during culture continuously released nitrogen into the aquaculture water resulting in an increase in dn 23 as shown in table 4 the nitrogen content of fresh feces and feces in the mdf influent were 6 77 0 26 and 5 02 0 42 in this experiment and the nitrogen loss rate was 25 86 the nitrogen content in unused bait and residual bait in the mdf influent was 6 72 0 15 and 5 76 0 57 and the nitrogen loss rate was approximately 14 29 also the nitrogen content in fresh shrimp and dead shrimp was 11 48 0 43 and 11 01 0 21 and the nitrogen loss rate was about 4 09 from these results during the experiment the nitrogen dissolution losses in feces residual bait and dead shrimp were 3 67 0 25 and 0 01 kg respectively based on eqs 15 and 16 the n excretion and n defecation were 5 48 and 14 19 kg and the ratio was 1 2 59 therefore in this study the n feeding n harvest n shed shells n dead shrimp n excretion and n defecation were 33 23 11 97 1 34 0 25 5 48 and 14 19 kg respectively the distribution of n feeding during the culture of shrimp was as follows n feeding 100 n harvest 36 02 n shed shells 4 03 n dead shrimp 0 75 n excretion 16 49 n defecation 42 70 fig 4c 3 4 2 nitrogen budget of the ras the ras controls the nitrogen content in aquaculture water through the water treatment units creating an excellent living environment for aquaculture species 8 these water treatment units play a very important role in the nitrogen budget of the ras as shown in table 3 the n input n harvest n shed shells n dead shrimp n ecr n mdf n mbbr n fs n water exchange and n water accumulation were 34 98 11 97 1 34 0 24 0 46 9 68 3 06 3 81 3 41 and 1 01 kg respectively the distribution of n input during the culture of shrimp was as follows n input 100 n harvest 34 22 n shed shells 3 83 n dead shrimp 0 69 n ecr 1 31 n mdf 27 67 n mbbr 8 75 n fs 10 89 n water exchange 9 75 n water accumulation 2 89 fig 4b during the 28 day culture period the utilization migration transformation and accumulation of n input in the ras of l vannamei are shown in fig 4 34 22 of n input accumulated in live shrimp 3 83 and 0 69 of n input existed in the form of shed shrimp shells and dead shrimp respectively 41 31 of n input was removed by water treatment units in the ras of which the mdf removed most followed by the fs mbbr and ecr 9 75 of n input was removed from the ras through water exchange 2 89 of n input accumulated in the ras a study by jackson et al 5 found that only about 22 of n input was recovered in shrimp at harvesting in an intensive shrimp farm 14 of n input existed in sediments and 57 of n input was discharged into the surrounding water environment chen et al 3 investigated the nitrogen budget in the culture modes of a conventional ras and water exchange system wes they found that the n input retained in shrimp was 19 10 and 23 58 in the ras and wes and most of the nitrogen 70 accumulated in aquaculture water and sediments in contrast a higher n harvest proved that the novel ras of l vannamei in this experiment improved the effective use of nitrogen moreover the n water accumulation was lower which is very important for ensuring the excellent aquaculture water environment of the ras and improving the breeding density and economic benefits significantly the water consumption in mdf backwashing and fs spraying was 133 and 8 5 m3 respectively a total of 141 5 m3 of aquaculture tail water was produced which led to 9 75 of the n input being removed through the wes in this experiment the daily water exchange rate of the ras was 5 6 it is noteworthy that the filter residue produced by the mdf and scum produced by the fs were removed from the ras with the aquaculture tail water resulting in approximately 48 31 of the n input in the aquaculture tail water therefore the recovery and utilization of nitrogen in aquaculture tail water were essential to protect the ecological environment 3 5 nitrogen recycling using economic algae or plants to recover nitrogen from aquaculture tail water does not only improve resource utilization and increase income but also protects the ecological environment 24 25 the average nutrient content and addition of filtrate and filter residue and the growth of chlorella vulgaris are shown in table 5 the average concentration of tan no2 n no3 n tn and po4 p in the filtrate was 0 42 0 05 17 21 23 63 and 0 53 mg l respectively the content of c n p and fe in the filter residue was 33 58 5 95 1 78 and 5 3 respectively significantly the iron based flocculants produced by the ecr which were used to improve the water treatment capacity of the ras were enriched in the filter residue fe is a very important element in algae and is conducive to the synthesis of chlorophyll 26 during the experiment the average addition of filtrate and filter residue in the microalgae culture system was 1 5 m3 d and 500 g d respectively moreover the biomass of chlorella vulgaris on the 0th and 7th day was 0 55 and 2 09 g l dry weight respectively and the average growth rate was 0 22 g l d in a previous study halfhide et al 27 investigated the growth of scenedesmus in the ras tail water of tilapia and an average growth rate of 0 19 g l d was obtained more recently małgorzata et al 28 reported that chlorella vulgaris in the ras tail water of salmon achieved a growth rate of 0 55 g l d during the experiment the average nitrogen addition was about 65 20 g d the amount of nitrogen harvested from chlorella vulgar n chlorella vulgar was about 52 71 g d and the nitrogen recovery rate was about 80 84 the distribution of n input in the chlorella vulgar culture system was as follows n input 100 n chlorella vulgar 80 84 n water exchange and water accumulation 19 16 3 6 energy consumption as shown in fig 5 with an increase in the culture period the backwashing frequency of mdf increased from 167 to 437 times d and i ecr increased from 24 64 to 49 22 a the average backwashing frequency of mdf was 317 times d and the working time was 0 79 h d the total number of backwashing times of the mdf during the experiment was 8875 moreover the average i ecr was 37 78 a during the experiment the energy consumption of each water treatment unit in the ras is shown in table 6 from this table it can be seen that the ecr removed 0 46 kg n by electro reduction and assisted the mdf mbbr and fs to remove 2 01 0 29 and 0 35 kg n by releasing flocculants the energy and fe electrode consumption of the ecr were 40 10 kwh and 17 64 kg and the cost of nitrogen removal was 44 73 rmb kg n moreover the energy consumption of the mdf mbbr and fs was 177 5 873 6 and 504 0 kwh the amount of nitrogen removal was 9 68 3 06 and 3 81 kg and the cost of nitrogen removal was 15 19 236 93 and 109 71 rmb kg n respectively from the perspective of nitrogen removal the mdf had the lowest energy consumption followed by the ecr fs and mbbr the aquaculture energy consumption of mdf mbbr and fs was 0 40 1 96 1 13 kwh kg shrimp respectively the studies by xu et al 13 and chen et al 3 found that the average energy consumption of mdf and mbbr in conventional ras was 0 34 and 2 23 kwh kg shrimp respectively in this study the energy consumption backwashing frequency of mdf increased by 8 17 due to ecr table 1 the flocculants produced by ecr increased the particle size of the tss and more pollutants were intercepted by mdf resulting in the increase of backwashing frequency and energy consumption of mdf moreover the improvement of the mdf working efficiency will reduce the influent load of mbbr and fs thus reducing the energy consumption of mbbr and fs therefore the scientific configuration between the ecr and other water treatment equipment in ras cannot be ignored which is one of our future concerns 4 conclusions in this experiment ec technology was applied to the ras of l vannamei and the nitrogen budget and recovery in the new ras were studied the nitrogen budget showed that n harvested only accounted for 34 22 of the n input during the culture of l vannamei approximately 61 26 of the n input needed to be treated by the water treatment unit in which about 48 31 of the n input could be recycled the ecr enhanced the removal of nitrogen in aquaculture water by the mdf mbbr and fs significantly dn in the ras accumulated more easily than ssn and the efficient removal of dn in aquaculture water was a challenge in the development of the ras the dissolution of residual bait and feces led to an increase in dn and the rapid removal of residual bait and feces was a method of reducing the concentration of dn in the ras in addition to the cultivation of chlorella vulgaris diversified nitrogen recovery strategies should be formulated to improve nitrogen recovery

12769,in this study electrocoagulation ec a green and efficient water treatment technology was used to improve the performance of the litopenaeus vannamei l vannamei ras the main objective was to investigate the nitrogen migration law of the innovative l vannamei ras establish a nitrogen recovery strategy and promote the sustainable development of the l vannamei ras it was found that 34 22 of input nitrogen n input accumulated in live shrimp 3 83 and 0 69 of n input existed in shed shrimp shell and dead shrimp 41 31 of n input was removed by the water treatment equipment 9 75 of n input was removed through water exchange and 2 89 of n input accumulated in the ras under the action of the ec the removal of nitrogen by a microscreen drum filter mdf moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr and foam separator fs increased by 26 39 9 52 and 9 10 respectively moreover a chlorella vulgaris culture system was used to recycle the waste nitrogen of the l vannamei ras with a nitrogen recovery rate of 80 84 these findings indicate that ec can significantly enhance the nitrogen removal of ras and the chlorella vulgaris can be used for the efficient recovery of the waste nitrogen from ras graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords recirculating aquaculture system electrocoagulation nitrogen budget nitrogen recycling energy consumption data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction nitrogen is one of the restrictive elements in ecosystems playing an important role not only in substance recycling and energy flow but also in ecological destruction 1 therefore in modern agriculture especially aquaculture scientific introduction of nitrogen is necessary to achieve economic production and prevent environmental pollution 1 2 litopenaeus vannamei l vannamei is an extremely important species in the aquaculture industry providing humans with a large amount of high quality proteins 3 in the conventional extensive shrimp culture model about 23 31 of n in feed is assimilated by shrimp and around 70 of nitrogen in feed enters the environment with sewage or is deposited in the bottom mud causing an environmental crisis 3 5 at present recirculating aquaculture systems rass have been used in l vannamei breeding due to the advantages of small footprint water saving controllability high yield and eco friendliness 3 6 7 the sewage generated during breeding in the ras is reused after purification with a water reuse rate of 90 which greatly reduces the discharge of nitrogen 8 improving the water treatment efficiency in the ras to reduce the daily water exchange rate can further reduce nitrogen emission during aquaculture which is of great significance in environmental protection total suspended solids tss produced during aquaculture contain abundant nitrogen that can be released into the aquaculture water so the effective management of tss is extremely important 9 in the ras the removal of tss mainly relies on the solid liquid separation equipment such as the microscreen drum filter mdf and foam separator fs 10 adding flocculants into aquaculture water before filtration can increase the particle size of tss thereby improving the water treatment efficiency of the solid liquid separation equipment in the ras and reducing nitrogen content and water exchange in the ras 9 11 compared with chemical flocculation electrocoagulation ec has attracted more attention as it is environmentally friendly has higher efficiency more controllability easier operation and lower sludge output 12 although ec technology has been widely used in the field of water treatment its application in rass is rarely reported in our recent study ec technology was first applied to the l vannamei ras by constructing a coupling technology of the electrocoagulation reactor ecr and mdf and it was found that the removal efficiency of tss chemical oxygen demand cod and total ammonia nitrogen tan in the ras was increased by 24 07 24 30 and 8 94 respectively 13 the nitrogen budget and recycling are important means of evaluating the sustainability of the ras 3 however the potential of the ec technology in the ras nitrogen budget has not been explored besides some challenges in the sustainability of ras such as the nitrogen recycling strategy of residual bait feces and aquaculture tail water remain unresolved therefore the main purpose of this study was to determine the nitrogen budget law in the innovative l vannamei ras with an ecr to establish a nitrogen recycling strategy for ras solid wastes and aquaculture tail water and to promote the sustainable development of the ras for this purpose the utilization migration transformation and accumulation of input nitrogen n input in the l vannamei ras between aquaculture objects and each water treatment unit were investigated and the effect of ec technology on the nitrogen budget was analyzed in addition the application of chlorella vulgaris in nitrogen recovery from ras solid waste and aquaculture tail water was studied the obtained results could provide guidance for the precise design and construction of the l vannamei ras optimization of the aquaculture water environment and promotion of the sustainable development of the ras 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up a pilot scale l vannamei ras with the total effective volume

the ecr i ecr was feedback controlled by the backwashing interval period of the mdf t mdf in the ras the t mdf decreased when the tss concentration in the aquaculture water increased 10 when the concentration of tss increased the working current of the ecr i ecr needed to rise to generate more flocculants improving the water treatment efficiency of the ras when the t mdf decreased the i ecr rose through the central control system of the ras otherwise the i ecr was reduced the ecr mdf linkage control system had a working cycle of 3 h in which the first 2 h were used to calculate the t mdf

nitrogen in aquaculture water before and after the experiment nitrogen removal in the water treatment unit n water treatment unit in the ras was calculated according to eq 18 18 n water treatment unit i 1 28 c effluent i c influent i v ras 1000 mn 24 where c effluent and c influent are the concentrations of tn in the effluent and influent of the water treatment unit respectively m h is the working time of the water treatment unit n exfoliated biofilm was calculated according to eq 19 19 n exfoliated biofilm i 1 28 c ssn in mbbr effluent i c ssn in mbbr influent i v ras 1000 n where c ssn in mbbr influent i and c ssn in mbbr effluent i mg l are the concentrations of ssn in the mbbr influent and effluent on day i 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in tn dn and ssn in the ras in the ras tn in aquaculture water was removed by the ecr mdf mbbr and fs fig 2a with an increase in the breeding period the tn ssn and dn in the ap effluent were raised from 19 56 0 17 0 52 0 05 and 19 04 0 18 mg l to 30 59 0 59 1 54 0 05 and 28 12 0 14 mg l respectively the concentration of ssn in aquaculture water was much lower than that of dn and this was because the removal of ssn by the water treatment unit in the ras was much higher than the removal of dn fig 2b c specifically the average daily removal of ssn by the mdf mbbr and fs was 345 65 47 16 and 120 80 g d respectively and the average daily removal of ssn by the ras was 466 45 g d fig 2b moreover it was found that the concentration of ssn in the effluent of the mbbr was higher than that in the influent fig 2b which was caused by replacement of the biofilm in the mbbr 13 17 during the 28 day experiment the total removal of ssn by the mdf mbbr fs and ras was 9 68 1 32 3 38 and 13 06 kg respectively in comparison the average daily removal of dn by the ecr mbbr and fs was 16 42 156 30 and 15 53 g d respectively and the average daily removal of dn by the ras was 188 25 g d fig 2c during the 28 day experiment the total removal of dn by the ecr mbbr fs and ras was 0 46 4 38 0 43 and 5 27 kg respectively obviously the dn in aquaculture water was mainly removed in the mbbr while ssn was mainly removed by the mdf and fs overall during the experiment the amounts of nitrogen removal by the ecr mdf mbbr and fs were 0 46 9 68 3 06 and 3 81 kg respectively as shown in table 1 on the 28th and 32nd day the backwashing times of the mdf the filter residue dry weight and the nitrogen content of the mdf filter residue were 437 and 404 times d 20 73 1 46 and 17 94 0 98 g times 5 02 0 42 and 4 97 0 21 respectively the scum dry weight of the fs and nitrogen content in fs scum were 40 25 1 26 and 37 53 0 53 g h and 11 22 0 21 and 10 95 0 35 respectively the c tn in the influent and effluent of the mbbr were 29 94 and 29 73 mg l and 31 76 and 31 76 mg l and the nitrogen removal amounts were 189 and 171 g d respectively the iron based flocculants produced by the ecr can improve the water treatment capacity of subsequent water treatment units 13 18 significantly the ecr not only increased the dry weight of the mdf filter residue and fs scum but also increased the content of nitrogen in the mdf filter residue and fs scum under the action of the ecr nitrogen removal by the mdf mbbr and fs increased by 26 39 9 52 and 9 10 respectively 3 2 changes in tan no2 n and no3 n in the ras tan and no2 n are significant indicators that receive attention during aquaculture and can threaten the health of breeding species 13 with an increase in the experimental period tan and no2 n in the ap effluent increased from 0 439 0 012 and 0 055 0 001 mg l to 0 662 0 009 and 0 098 0 02 mg l fig 3a b and increased by 0 223 and 0 043 mg l respectively the average concentrations of tan and no2 n in the effluent of the ap ecr mbbr and fs were 0 578 and 0 073 mg l 0 572 and 0 073 mg l 0 420 and 0 050 mg l and 0 380 and 0 048 mg l respectively the removal efficiency of tan and no2 n by the ecr mbbr and fs was 1 00 and 0 26 30 and 31 51 and 6 92 and 2 74 respectively in the ecr active oxidizing substances are produced during ec which can degrade tan and no2 n 13 14 in this experiment the removal effect of the ecr on tan and no2 n was not obvious due to the large inlet flow in the ecr in a previous study xu et al 11 investigated the removal efficiencies of tan and no2 n by the ecr fe was used as the anode the influent flow was 67 l h and the current was 1 23 a which were 63 19 1 69 and 67 42 3 47 respectively as expected the mbbr was the major processing unit in the degradation of tan and no2 n 8 significantly the fs removed part of tan and no2 n which was mainly due to the oxidation of ozone ozone can degrade organic matter eliminate pathogenic bacteria and control the concentration of tan and no2 n 10 however the addition amount of ozone should be carefully controlled preferably 20 g ozone kg feed day 1 19 in this study the addition amount of ozone was about 12 8 g ozone kg feed day 1 which may be attributed to the enhanced water treatment capacity of mdf and mbbr by ecr in the ras tan and no2 n with high toxicity are transformed into no3 n with less toxicity under the action of microorganisms 8 with an increase in the experimental period the concentration of no3 n in the ap effluent increased from 16 725 0 065 mg l to 18 760 0 139 mg l fig 3c an increase of 2 04 mg l during the experiment the average concentration of no3 n in the effluent of the ap ecr mbbr and fs was 17 691 17 675 17 775 and 17 817 mg l respectively the concentration of no3 n in aquaculture water decreased slightly after ecr treatment but increased after mbbr and fs treatment the ecr can remove no3 n in the aquaculture water through electro reduction 11 moreover due to the presence of sufficient dissolved oxygen in the ras denitrification in the ras was weak leading to the accumulation of no3 n 8 3 3 shrimp growth performance the growth of aquaculture species is an important indicator and reflects the feasibility of the novel ras as shown in table 2 the daily growth rates of l vannamei body length and weight were 0 13 cm d and 0 21 g d respectively after 28 days of culture the density of the live shrimp increased from 1 90 kg m3 to 6 75 kg m3 and live biomass increased by 436 50 kg during the experiment the number and wet weight of dead shrimp were approximately 1600 and 9 5 kg and the survival rate was 97 87 a higher growth and survival rate proved that the new ras was feasible for the culture of l vannamei moreover during the experiment the biomass of the shrimp live and dead shrimp increased by 446 0 kg wet weight and the fcr was 1 2 a study by chaikaew et al 20 found that when the feeding frequency of l vannamei increased from 2 times d to 6 times d the fcr decreased from 2 6 to 1 8 the lower residual bait rate and fcr can improve the effective utilization of nitrogen 21 which was attributed to the automatic bait throwing machine and the excellent water quality environment in this study 3 4 nitrogen budget 3 4 1 nitrogen budget of l vannamei as shown in table 3 during the experiment a total of 520 54 kg of the bait with a nitrogen content of 6 72 0 15 was delivered in the ras of which n input was 34 98 kg 494 50 kg of the bait was eaten by the shrimp during breeding of which the nitrogen content was 33 23 kg n feeding 30 40 kg of residual bait was produced during the experiment and the amount of nitrogen in the residual bait was 1 75 kg n residual bait accounting for 5 of the n input moreover the n harvest and n dead shrimp were 11 97 and 0 25 kg respectively a total of 20 34 kg dry weight shrimp shells were shed during the 28 day growth period and the nitrogen content was 6 58 0 15 1 34 kg as shown in section 3 1 the amount of dn and ssn removed by the water treatment unit in the ras was 5 27 and 13 06 kg respectively based on eqs 13 14 and table 3 the amount of n dn and n ssn produced was 9 41 kg and 13 34 kg during the experiment and the ratio was 1 1 42 in the report by chaikaew et al 20 the ratio of n dn to n ssn was about 1 1 3 and was 1 0 98 in the study by de melo filho et al 22 the residual bait and feces produced during culture continuously released nitrogen into the aquaculture water resulting in an increase in dn 23 as shown in table 4 the nitrogen content of fresh feces and feces in the mdf influent were 6 77 0 26 and 5 02 0 42 in this experiment and the nitrogen loss rate was 25 86 the nitrogen content in unused bait and residual bait in the mdf influent was 6 72 0 15 and 5 76 0 57 and the nitrogen loss rate was approximately 14 29 also the nitrogen content in fresh shrimp and dead shrimp was 11 48 0 43 and 11 01 0 21 and the nitrogen loss rate was about 4 09 from these results during the experiment the nitrogen dissolution losses in feces residual bait and dead shrimp were 3 67 0 25 and 0 01 kg respectively based on eqs 15 and 16 the n excretion and n defecation were 5 48 and 14 19 kg and the ratio was 1 2 59 therefore in this study the n feeding n harvest n shed shells n dead shrimp n excretion and n defecation were 33 23 11 97 1 34 0 25 5 48 and 14 19 kg respectively the distribution of n feeding during the culture of shrimp was as follows n feeding 100 n harvest 36 02 n shed shells 4 03 n dead shrimp 0 75 n excretion 16 49 n defecation 42 70 fig 4c 3 4 2 nitrogen budget of the ras the ras controls the nitrogen content in aquaculture water through the water treatment units creating an excellent living environment for aquaculture species 8 these water treatment units play a very important role in the nitrogen budget of the ras as shown in table 3 the n input n harvest n shed shells n dead shrimp n ecr n mdf n mbbr n fs n water exchange and n water accumulation were 34 98 11 97 1 34 0 24 0 46 9 68 3 06 3 81 3 41 and 1 01 kg respectively the distribution of n input during the culture of shrimp was as follows n input 100 n harvest 34 22 n shed shells 3 83 n dead shrimp 0 69 n ecr 1 31 n mdf 27 67 n mbbr 8 75 n fs 10 89 n water exchange 9 75 n water accumulation 2 89 fig 4b during the 28 day culture period the utilization migration transformation and accumulation of n input in the ras of l vannamei are shown in fig 4 34 22 of n input accumulated in live shrimp 3 83 and 0 69 of n input existed in the form of shed shrimp shells and dead shrimp respectively 41 31 of n input was removed by water treatment units in the ras of which the mdf removed most followed by the fs mbbr and ecr 9 75 of n input was removed from the ras through water exchange 2 89 of n input accumulated in the ras a study by jackson et al 5 found that only about 22 of n input was recovered in shrimp at harvesting in an intensive shrimp farm 14 of n input existed in sediments and 57 of n input was discharged into the surrounding water environment chen et al 3 investigated the nitrogen budget in the culture modes of a conventional ras and water exchange system wes they found that the n input retained in shrimp was 19 10 and 23 58 in the ras and wes and most of the nitrogen 70 accumulated in aquaculture water and sediments in contrast a higher n harvest proved that the novel ras of l vannamei in this experiment improved the effective use of nitrogen moreover the n water accumulation was lower which is very important for ensuring the excellent aquaculture water environment of the ras and improving the breeding density and economic benefits significantly the water consumption in mdf backwashing and fs spraying was 133 and 8 5 m3 respectively a total of 141 5 m3 of aquaculture tail water was produced which led to 9 75 of the n input being removed through the wes in this experiment the daily water exchange rate of the ras was 5 6 it is noteworthy that the filter residue produced by the mdf and scum produced by the fs were removed from the ras with the aquaculture tail water resulting in approximately 48 31 of the n input in the aquaculture tail water therefore the recovery and utilization of nitrogen in aquaculture tail water were essential to protect the ecological environment 3 5 nitrogen recycling using economic algae or plants to recover nitrogen from aquaculture tail water does not only improve resource utilization and increase income but also protects the ecological environment 24 25 the average nutrient content and addition of filtrate and filter residue and the growth of chlorella vulgaris are shown in table 5 the average concentration of tan no2 n no3 n tn and po4 p in the filtrate was 0 42 0 05 17 21 23 63 and 0 53 mg l respectively the content of c n p and fe in the filter residue was 33 58 5 95 1 78 and 5 3 respectively significantly the iron based flocculants produced by the ecr which were used to improve the water treatment capacity of the ras were enriched in the filter residue fe is a very important element in algae and is conducive to the synthesis of chlorophyll 26 during the experiment the average addition of filtrate and filter residue in the microalgae culture system was 1 5 m3 d and 500 g d respectively moreover the biomass of chlorella vulgaris on the 0th and 7th day was 0 55 and 2 09 g l dry weight respectively and the average growth rate was 0 22 g l d in a previous study halfhide et al 27 investigated the growth of scenedesmus in the ras tail water of tilapia and an average growth rate of 0 19 g l d was obtained more recently małgorzata et al 28 reported that chlorella vulgaris in the ras tail water of salmon achieved a growth rate of 0 55 g l d during the experiment the average nitrogen addition was about 65 20 g d the amount of nitrogen harvested from chlorella vulgar n chlorella vulgar was about 52 71 g d and the nitrogen recovery rate was about 80 84 the distribution of n input in the chlorella vulgar culture system was as follows n input 100 n chlorella vulgar 80 84 n water exchange and water accumulation 19 16 3 6 energy consumption as shown in fig 5 with an increase in the culture period the backwashing frequency of mdf increased from 167 to 437 times d and i ecr increased from 24 64 to 49 22 a the average backwashing frequency of mdf was 317 times d and the working time was 0 79 h d the total number of backwashing times of the mdf during the experiment was 8875 moreover the average i ecr was 37 78 a during the experiment the energy consumption of each water treatment unit in the ras is shown in table 6 from this table it can be seen that the ecr removed 0 46 kg n by electro reduction and assisted the mdf mbbr and fs to remove 2 01 0 29 and 0 35 kg n by releasing flocculants the energy and fe electrode consumption of the ecr were 40 10 kwh and 17 64 kg and the cost of nitrogen removal was 44 73 rmb kg n moreover the energy consumption of the mdf mbbr and fs was 177 5 873 6 and 504 0 kwh the amount of nitrogen removal was 9 68 3 06 and 3 81 kg and the cost of nitrogen removal was 15 19 236 93 and 109 71 rmb kg n respectively from the perspective of nitrogen removal the mdf had the lowest energy consumption followed by the ecr fs and mbbr the aquaculture energy consumption of mdf mbbr and fs was 0 40 1 96 1 13 kwh kg shrimp respectively the studies by xu et al 13 and chen et al 3 found that the average energy consumption of mdf and mbbr in conventional ras was 0 34 and 2 23 kwh kg shrimp respectively in this study the energy consumption backwashing frequency of mdf increased by 8 17 due to ecr table 1 the flocculants produced by ecr increased the particle size of the tss and more pollutants were intercepted by mdf resulting in the increase of backwashing frequency and energy consumption of mdf moreover the improvement of the mdf working efficiency will reduce the influent load of mbbr and fs thus reducing the energy consumption of mbbr and fs therefore the scientific configuration between the ecr and other water treatment equipment in ras cannot be ignored which is one of our future concerns 4 conclusions in this experiment ec technology was applied to the ras of l vannamei and the nitrogen budget and recovery in the new ras were studied the nitrogen budget showed that n harvested only accounted for 34 22 of the n input during the culture of l vannamei approximately 61 26 of the n input needed to be treated by the water treatment unit in which about 48 31 of the n input could be recycled the ecr enhanced the removal of nitrogen in aquaculture water by the mdf mbbr and fs significantly dn in the ras accumulated more easily than ssn and the efficient removal of dn in aquaculture water was a challenge in the development of the ras the dissolution of residual bait and feces led to an increase in dn and the rapid removal of residual bait and feces was a method of reducing the concentration of dn in the ras in addition to the cultivation of chlorella vulgaris diversified nitrogen recovery strategies should be formulated to improve nitrogen recovery
