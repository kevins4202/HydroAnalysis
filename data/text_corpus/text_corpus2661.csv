13305,a caustic absorbent like naoh used in biogas upgrading can be recycled by regeneration at a moderate temperature using untreated groundwater to prepare the absorbent is cost saving but the of co2 and h2s removal efficiencies from biogas need to be confirmed 60 experiments were performed in pilot scale scrubber for data on operating conditions vs removal efficiency it was found that the removal efficiencies were not significantly different between using groundwater and softened water to prepare the naoh even though 0 3 0 4 of precipitate was found in naoh solution when using groundwater 99 removal efficiencies of co2 and h2s were achieved at the minimum naoh concentration of 4 g l and l g ratio of 0 3 the operating conditions for specific biomethane concentration requirements are tabulated and the relation of operating conditions to co2 removal efficiency is provided as an empirical correlation moreover there was a good agreement between the experimental data and the simulation by aspen hysys using the acid gas caustic wash method the caustic scrubber was then simulated for the 500 m3 h biogas production rate and the chosen column diameter and height were 1 m and 6 m respectively which is 30 fold smaller in volume compared to the bio scrubber for which no co2 removal was observed for bio methane production this study reveals the potential to use a cost saving caustic scrubber to replace the bio scrubber graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords groundwater bio methane biogas upgrading absorption scrubbing 1 introduction the public enterprises and industries are very interested in waste treatment and in utilizing wastes for biogas production the typical biogas mainly consists of 50 75 methane ch4 25 50 carbon dioxide co2 1500 3000 ppm hydrogen sulfide h2s and ammonia nh3 nitrogen n2 and water vapor 1 2 biogas upgrading by removing non fuel and hazardous contaminants such as co2 and h2s is crucial thus a high concentration of ch4 makes biogas an attractive fuel and solves problems from emissions of ch4 as a greenhouse gas that are several times more harmful than emissions of co2 3 the advantages of purifying biogas are in increasing the quality of fuel gas reducing transportation costs preventing corrosion of metal equipment and reducing health hazards 4 the biogas of improved quality can be applied as natural gas for example in ng converted vehicles or used to produce electricity with gas turbines because biogas is a high octane fuel that can easily be used in spark ignition si engines 5 6 several alternative technologies of physical biological and chemical types have been reported for the removal co2 and h2s 7 pressure swing adsorption is suitable for small or medium plant capacity requires high investment process control and operational costs and ch4 can be lost when valves malfunction 8 membrane separation is proper for a small to mid scale operation with low gas flow rate but it has low selectivity expensive operation and complex maintenance 9 cryogenic separation operates under very low temperature 170 c and high pressure 80 bars main units turbines heat exchangers distillation columns and compressors are necessary for cryogenic separation the capital and operational costs rise with high energy requirements expensive investment and operation 10 water scrubbing at high pressure has a high operation cost due to large electricity consumption and has ch4 losses water scrubbing at atmospheric pressure is limited to small installations and is not generally commercially supplied because a high liquid to biogas flow ratio is required 11 the type of technique implemented depends on economic factors such as investment costs operational costs maintenance costs or possibly ecological issues around the factory location 12 the biogas produced in palm oil industries is mostly used for electricity generation the maintenance costs for reciprocating engines increase with h2s concentration in the feed gas and the limit imposed on h2s concentration depends on engine specifications but below 100 ppm h2s has been suggested 13 for use in gas engine the removal of co2 is unnecessary 14 apart from using biogas to generate electricity compressed biomethane gas cbg is an alternative biogas product after the co2 and h2s are removed the biogas can be used to produce cbg which can substitute for ng cng or even lpg the biogas is a type of high octane fuel that can be easily used in spark ignition si engines compared to lpg and ng biogas has a much lower flame speed and a lower heating value these physical and chemical characteristics have great influences on the applications of biogas in si engines 15 cbg was promoted to replace lpg in heating or vehicle usage it is almost 20 lighter than air which is an advantage over lpg when a car has been in an accident or there is otherwise a fuel leak cbg will rise up in the air while lpg will float over the ground cbg has an ignition temperature of 650 750 c which is higher than the autoignition temperature of lpg so it also has a safety advantage in this respect 16 nowadays there is no standard requirement for cbg in thailand the minimum ch4 and maximum co2 in cbg differ in many standard requirements such as those of the us and the eu most palm oil mills use bio scrubber and bio filter to remove h2s from biogas in a bio filter system air must be also fed for the subsistence of sulfur oxidizing bacteria sob 17 18 one problem encountered in a long term operation of the biological system for biogas treatment is the blockages in the column due to sulfur sludge and microbial cell growth 19 20 the fouling in column leads to increased pressure drop due to excess biomass increased packing material compaction in the scrubber and reduced mass transfer rate of h2s to liquids with loss of efficiency and rate of h2s removal 21 22 sulfur sludge discharged from the bioreactor must be removed in an environment conscious manner effluent of bio scrubber or bio filter is laden with salts cod and has a low ph making it hard to degrade biologically this may lead to the formation of odors in anaerobic conditions in addition the use of biological systems has a disadvantage in terms of system stability and slow removal rates requiring large columns for prolonged gas retention chemical absorption is a promising approach for overcoming the problems in using bio scrubber the reactor configurations and the operating procedures in chemical absorption and in bio scrubber are similar therefore chemical absorption could replace an existing bio scrubber the main absorbent used in chemical scrubbing is amine 23 24 25 26 however amine is toxic expensive and degradable naoh and na2co3 are simple chemicals that are less toxic less expensive and less degradable than an amine derivative solution making these more attractive moreover the required naoh amount to remove a certain quantity of co2 or h2s is less than that of mea 27 the economic viability of the naoh and mea processes are compared to investigate the effect of choice between mea and naoh on the process economics naoh process is suggested high sustainability potential because it reduces the parasitic energy requirements and high initial capital cost associated with mea scrubbing in regeneration pressure of 1 5 3 bars and temperature of 120 160 c 26 28 in addition h2s rich biogas must be pre treated for h2s removal using activated carbon filters to avoid toxic build up in the amine reagents if h2s is absorbed desorption of h2s from the solvent post scrubbing requires more energy 29 naoh has been reviewed as an efficient co2 absorber and is conventionally used in a packed column in many studies 30 31 the method has been claimed to allow for high rate capture of co2 when using naoh at a low pressure drop allowing reduced capital cost and decreased water loss 32 33 recently it has been reported that spent naoh discharge from biogas scrubber is regenerable by using moderate thermal treatment 34 rattanaya et al 35 report that the naoh solution recovery is achieved experimentally at 95 c and 0 6 bar vacuum level by using a batch reactor and heat jacket the co2 and h2s removal efficiencies of naoh solution before and after the recovery are similar at 80 and 99 respectively generally diverse types of water such as tap water softened water or process water can be used as a solvent for the naoh solution however some factories use pretreated groundwater for the production process groundwater usually contains several ion species depending on the location 36 these ions must be removed to prevent contamination of the main product to reduce water pretreatment costs the idea to use raw groundwater for naoh solution is interesting however the efficiency of groundwater naoh solution for biogas upgrading needs to be investigated biogas flow rate absorbent flow rate and concentration column dimensions and packing material are important factors that affect h2s and co2 removal from biogas 37 38 39 theoretically the absorber operating conditions can be designed for a desired biogas outlet quality however experiments with varied operating conditions can probe the correlation between the operating conditions and the h2s and co2 removal efficiencies 40 characteristics of groundwater vary by location so the properties of a specific groundwater naoh absorbent and its ability to upgrade biogas quality are needed for scale up this research aimed to improve the biogas quality to produce cbg by getting rid of co2 and h2s by caustic absorption the efficiency of a caustic solution untreated groundwater naoh solution or softened water naoh solution was compared pilot scale packed column was operated at various biogas flow rates g naoh solution flow rates l and naoh concentrations c to explore the correlation between the operating conditions and the h2s and co2 removal efficiencies the scale up was further estimated based on data obtained from the pilot scale experiments with simulations in aspen hysys in order to compare the efficiency with bio scrubber of the factory 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials biogas 56 3 ch4 35 1 co2 8 37 air and 2300 ppm h2s produced form palm oil mill effluent at phrasaeng green power company limited surat thani thailand was used in the absorption experiments commercial grade solid sodium hydroxide was used to prepare absorbent solution groundwater and softened water from the factory were used for preparing the naoh solutions 2 2 system details and experimental 1 2 4 10 and 20 g l naoh solutions were prepared by using groundwater while only 4 g l naoh was prepared using softened water for solvent comparison test the precipitates developed during naoh solution preparation were collected and dried before analyzing the chemical compositions and crystal structures filter cloth was installed before the pump inlet to prevent the precipitates from entering the absorption system absorption system was set up at phrasaeng green power company limited surat thani thailand fig 1 shows absorption system diagram including 1 acrylic column 10 cm inside diameter 200 cm height packed to 140 cm height with pall rings 1 25 cm 2 200 l plastic absorbent storage tank 3 liquid rotameter 4 gas rotameter 5 pump 6 gas sampling valve 7 liquid sampling valve 8 water bath 9 blower 10 biogas plant and 11 used absorbent tank the temperature of field biogas was controlled at 35 c by passing the gas pipeline in a water bath before feeding to the bottom of packed column while the naoh solution was pumped from the storage tank to the top of the packed column the biogas and solution flow rates were measured and controlled by rotameters inlet and outlet biogas samples were collected at 5 10 and 15 min using an air sampling pump for analyzing the biogas composition inlet and outlet naoh solution samples were collected at 5 10 and 15 min for the measurement of ph alkalinity bicarbonate carbonate hydroxide and total sulfide the effects of various operating parameters naoh concentration 1 20 g l biogas flow rate 300 900 l h absorbent flow rate 60 180 l h and sources of water used to prepare naoh solution groundwater and softened water were studied 2 3 analytical methods gas compositions co2 h2s ch4 and o2 in biogas during absorption were measured with a gas analyzer gmf 416 portable multi channel handheld gas analyzer and selected gas samples were also measured by gas chromatography with a thermal conductivity detector in order to assess accuracy of the gas analyzer the chemical composition of precipitate during the preparation of naoh solution was measured by x ray fluorescence spectrometry xrf x ray fluorescence spectrometer zetium panalytical while the detailed phase and structural information of precipitate was analyzed by using x ray diffraction xrd x ray diffractometer empyrean panalytical the total suspended solids in the naoh solution was tested by evaporation in a weighted dish and drying to a constant weight apha and awwa 1997 the ph of the naoh solution was measured using a standard ph meter ph benchtop meter hanna hi522 alkalinity of the absorbed solution sample was measured by titration with a volumetrically standardized sulfuric acid solution using end point indicators and or ph meter aoac official method 973 43 concentrations of bicarbonate ion hco3 carbonate co3 2 and hydroxide ion oh were estimated from ph and titration volume using the equation proposed by apha 1985 total sulfide s dissolved h2s bisulfide ion hs and sulfide ion s2 of absorbed solution sample were analyzed with the iodometric method apha awwa and wpcf 1998 by volumetrically standardized sodium thiosulfate solution based on the amount of iodine remaining after reacting with sulfide all experimental data were subjected to two way analysis of variance anova with statistical significance set at 95 confidence level 2 4 removal efficiency calculation and overall height of the gas film transfer unit h og co2 and h2s removal efficiency was calculated using eqs 1 and 2 1 c o 2 removal efficiency c o 2 in c o 2 out c o 2 in 100 where co 2 in and co 2 out are the percentages of co2 in the inlet and outlet biogases respectively 2 h 2 s removal efficiency h 2 s in h 2 s out h 2 s in 100 where h 2 s in and h 2 s out are the h2s concentrations ppm in the inlet and outlet biogases respectively apart from the removal efficiency the absorber performance could be more reliable in terms of h og the smaller h og is the more efficient is interfacial contact allowing in turn less packed height the h og can be estimated by eq 3 3 h og z n og where z is packed bed height and n og is the number of the gas film transfer units and can be calculated as in eq 4 4 n og y out y in dy y ln y in y out where y in and y out is percentages of solute in the inlet and outlet biogases respectively n og depends only on the inlet and outlet concentrations of the solute and applies only when the equilibrium line is straight and the slope approaches zero for very soluble the reaction of co2 and h2s with the naoh is rapid and the balance with a solution tends to zero 41 2 5 multiple linear regressions performed using the r program the relationship of co2 removal efficiency with the operating conditions was fit by multiple linear regressions using the r program 2 6 simulation and simple scale up the performance of absorption process using groundwater as solvent for the naoh solution was compared with the simulation of aspen hysys at the same conditions scale up for a maximum biogas flow rate of 500 m3 h generated from the biogas plant of phrasaeng green power company limited was estimated by aspen hysys as shown in fig 2 the process output from the scale up simulation was compared with bio scrubber of the factory 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristic of the naoh solutions as shown in table 1 the groundwater has hardness 320 mg l as caco3 which is 10 times higher than hardness of the softened water hardness is possibly caused by the dissolved salts caco3 ca hco3 2 mgco3 mg hco3 2 cacl2 caso4 mgcl2 and mgso4 white precipitate was observed during the preparation of groundwater naoh solution while the softened water naoh solution remained clear however the precipitate had a very high sedimentation rate and was easily separated from the solution as higher concentrations of naoh were pursued more precipitation occurred at a high concentration of naoh solution 20 g l the total suspended solids were 4 365 g l or about 0 4 as shown in table 1 the chemical composition of precipitate was characterized as shown in table 2 the main inorganic element present in the precipitates was ca with smaller amounts of mg and si and trace amounts of na al p s k ti fe zn as sr and ba from xrd analysis it was confirmed that the precipitate consisted mainly of calcite caco3 and brucite mg oh 2 it is worth noting that when thermal regeneration of spent naoh is applied in the absorption process only a little groundwater is needed for make up of the absorbent volume 35 therefore precipitation might occur only in the first cycle of naoh preparation moreover no heavy metals were detected in the precipitate so handling this precipitate is comparatively easy theoretically ph of the naoh solution can be calculated from its concentration in pure water the impurities in water led to ph differing from the calculation results at 4 g l naoh 0 1 m in pure water the ph should be 13 a lower ph of 12 64 was measured for the groundwater naoh solution this complements the xrd results mentioned above namely that the hydroxide species precipitated with the hardness cations the ph of softened water naoh solution was 12 89 in most cases ph of an absorbent is considered a crucial parameter in acidic gas absorption and a higher ph of the absorbent should give increased removal efficiency 42 43 alkalinity of solution demonstrates the capacity of water to resist acidification or the strength of a buffer solution thus for acid gas removal the alkalinity of an absorbent should be also considered the alkaline species of co3 2 hco3 and oh are measured and calculated in table 1 total alkalinity of the groundwater is 270 mg caco3 l and only hco3 group was found total alkalinity of the naoh solution increased with the naoh amount the total alkalinity with 1 20 g l ranged within 1425 24 410 mg l the hco3 group decreased with concentration of naoh because the hco3 was converted to co3 2 at 4 g l naoh in solution there were almost twice as many alkalinity groups oh in the softened water naoh solution than in groundwater naoh solution this matched the observed higher ph of softened water naoh solution in contrast the alkalinity groups co3 2 and hco in the softened water naoh solution were found in lesser amounts than in groundwater naoh solution the total alkalinities of groundwater naoh solution and softened water naoh solution were 5200 mg l and 4915 mg l respectively normally higher ph of an absorbent will give higher acid gas removal efficiency however the buffer capacity which can be expressed in terms of total alkalinity is also worth consideration there is lack of research reporting on this point of view this study investigated the effects of different alkalinities and ph levels for the two types of absorbent 3 2 co2 and h2s removal efficiencies of groundwater the performance in biogas upgrading using groundwater naoh solution is shown in terms of co2 and h2s removal efficiencies in fig 3 increasing the biogas flow rate from 300 to 900 l h caused the co2 removal efficiency to obviously decrease when 1 10 g l naoh solutions were used when the biogas flow rate is increased the retention time of biogas in the system is reduced and the contact time of gas phase with liquid phase is shorter in addition increasing the biogas flow rate means that the co2 mass entering per unit time is also increased so the molar ratio of co2 and naoh increased which will degrade ability of the solution to capture co2 44 when naoh concentration increased the loss in co2 removal with biogas flow rate decreased co2 removal efficiencies were independent to the biogas flow rates at excess naoh loading with a concentration of 20 g l in contrast co2 removal efficiency increased when solution flow rate and concentration increased because the molar ratio of naoh to captured co2 increased the increasing trend of co2 removal efficiency with solution flow rate decreased with naoh concentration co2 removal efficiencies were also independent to the solution flow rates at excess naoh loading with concentration of 20 g l as shown in fig 4 higher than 97 h2s removal efficiencies were observed at all operating conditions the h2s removal efficiency was higher than that of co2 due to much lower h2s content in the biogas and moreover the water solubility of h2s is higher than that of co2 removing co2 could improve the calorific value of the biogas 45 the biogas burns very well when the ch4 content is higher than 50 and the combustion temperature and heating value increase with ch4 content in the biogas 46 the bio methane can replace diesel and ngv as vehicle fuels the bio methane with at least 80 of ch4 can be injected to the grid in netherland while in sweden and switzerland the ch4 content requirements are higher at 95 and 96 of ch4 respectively for france and austria the co2 content should be below 2 while in germany the co2 content is not more than 6 therefore the lowest l g ratio for 100 h2s removal efficiency with 80 90 or 100 co2 removal efficiency at different naoh concentrations retrieved from this study is summarized in table 3 l g ratio is a useful dimensionless parameter for operating the absorber l g has to be optimized to prevent low absorption efficiency from too low l g loading and to prevent increased pressure drop across the absorption and excess chemical use from too high l g loading moreover the empirical correlations for dependence of co2 removal efficiency on the operating conditions l g and c were fit using multiple linear regressions all the pilot experiments providing 99 h2s removal efficiency were input to the regression and the simple model obtained is shown in eq 5 5 c o 2 removal 598 135 c 0 1772 l 1 36 g 47 855 multiple r 2 0 8082 approximately 80 of the variation in co2 removal efficiency r2 0 8082 with r2 adjusted of 79 52 was explained by the multiple linear regression model all three parameters affected the co2 removal efficiency significantly the concentration of naoh and biogas flow rate were significant at p values 2 98 10 14 and 2 81 10 9 respectively the solution flow rate was a minor independent variable at p 0 00489 pr 0 001 this correlation is useful for the removal efficiency prediction and the operating condition selection in the pilot scale absorption system 3 3 mass distributions in the gas and liquid phases after co2 and h2s were absorbed by the naoh solution the ph of the effluent had decreased firstly absorbed co2 reacts with oh to generate co3 2 after that the co3 2 could also react with the entering co2 and can be converted to hco3 as in eqs 6 7 similarly in h2s absorption the s2 and hs will be present in the absorbed solution as in eqs 8 9 the proportions of oh co3 2 hco3 s2 and hs depend on ph of the solution higher hco3 and hs are usually found at a low ph 6 c o 2 2 o h c o 3 2 h 2 o 7 co 2 c o 3 2 h 2 o 2 hc o 3 8 h 2 s o h hs h 2 o 9 hs h 2 o oh s 2 2 h 2 o alkalinity species and sulfide concentration in the pilot scale scrubber effluent were measured and are presented in table 4 total alkalinity oh co3 2 hco3 of the scrubber effluent was not significantly different from the scrubber influent because the ph of the effluent was greater than 7 0 however the oh concentration had decreased while co3 2 hco3 had increased the result is similar to rattanaya et al 47 in which they compared using alkaline absorbent extracted from ash and naoh to remove co2 the naoh solution was adjusted to ph 12 4 which was ph of the alkaline ash solution the results showed that the total alkalinities before and after the absorption column were not significantly different but the form of alkalinity had changed from oh and co3 2 to hco3 species the co2 removal efficiency using alkaline ash solution which had more alkalinity was higher than with the naoh solution it can be concluded that the amount of alkalinity in the solution affects the absorption process more than ph rattanaya et al 35 reported that to regenerate the spent naoh by a thermal method a suitable alkalinity of co3 2 hco3 is above 5000 mg l therefore the naoh concentrations below 4 g l are not proper for the process using thermal regeneration oh will not be regenerated by thermal process as proposed by rattanaya et al 35 so the naoh solutions with excess concentration 10 and 20 g l are not considered in further discussion at 4 g l naoh concentration 300 l h biogas flow rate and 90 l h solution flow rate were selected as the optimum conditions providing 99 co2 and h2s removal efficiencies the mass distribution at this operating condition is illustrated in fig 5 in the gas phase 35 of co2 in biogas with 300 l h came into absorber corresponding to 3442 mg co2 entering 0 75 co2 in the outlet biogas equals 51 mg co2 thus 3390 mg of co2 had disappeared from the gas phase and should be detected in the effluent there were in total 1996 mg co2 contained in the influent naoh solution from mass balance calculation the total co2 in the effluent should be 3390 1996 5386 mg but only 4195 mg co2 in the effluent were detected the 1092 mg of co2 were lost maybe because pressure inside the column was higher than outside so the co2 could be partly released from the solution to the atmosphere similar mechanisms could be acting in the mass distribution of sulfide species between gas and liquid phases in our absorber 3 4 comparison of different sources of water to prepare naoh solution the efficiency of removing co2 and h2s by naoh solutions prepared with different sources of water were investigated groundwater and softened water were used as solvents in the pilot scale experiments while pure water was used for the process simulation at the optimum operating conditions of 300 l h of biogas flow rate 90 l h of the naoh solution and 4 g l naoh concentration the corresponding removal efficiencies are shown in table 5 it is confirmed that even though softened water naoh had ph 11 70 which is higher than the ph of groundwater naoh 10 56 still due to the groundwater naoh solution having higher alkalinity the co2 and h2s removal from biogas were similar 98 5 using the softened water naoh achieved about 1 higher removal efficiency than groundwater naoh solution this obviously confirms that the groundwater without any pretreatment can be utilized as a water source to prepare naoh solution for the biogas scrubber the biogas absorption process was simulated at the same scrubber configuration and operating conditions except for the water source for preparing an absorbent softened water or groundwater with diverse characteristic are not in the database of aspen hysys so pure water was chosen as a solvent for naoh solution the simulated results showed co2 and h2s removal efficiencies not significantly different from the experiments the differences in co2 and h2s removal efficiencies by absorption with groundwater naoh solution compared with pure water naoh solution were only 0 84 and 1 09 respectively which are acceptable in addition normally the moisture content will have increased in the biogas at scrubber outlet from the simulation the moisture content had 3 53 increases at the outlet however because moisture content in the biogas was not determined and also the moisture in the biogas was removed before the determination of biogas composition the composition of the outlet biogas from the experiment is presented only on a dry basis it can be observed that the air entering in biogas is absorbed into the solution after the process while in the experiments the air is still present in the outlet biogas this indicates that the naoh in the experiment was receiving air from atmosphere during preparation and pumping processes moreover the profile of ch4 co2 and h2s along the packed column height was also simulated as shown in fig 6 the simulation shows that to obtain 99 co2 and h2s removal efficiency 1 12 m packed height is sufficient while the experimental operating conditions had 1 40 m packed height thus it is worth noting that for the further simulated scale up a safety factor larger than 1 25 is suggested generally with a larger packed column height and gas liquid contact surface increase improved removal efficiency is achieved h og indicates the efficiency with packed height considered 48 a lower h og indicates more effective operation at the same gas flow rate input because a lower packing height is required for the same removal efficiency table 6 compares the efficiencies of co2 and h2s removal from biogas in our study to previous literature on chemical scrubbing the co2 and h2s efficiencies in terms of h og when using groundwater naoh in this study is competitive when compared to other studies h og can be decreased by lowering the inlet gas flow rate lowering the co2 and h2s concentrations raising the solution concentration or increasing the solution inlet flow rate in terms of a techno economic assessment naoh and mea processes were investigated by yusuf et al 28 the naoh process would result in significant energy savings the electricity demand of the naoh process was 35 kwh t co2 which was just 7 of the mea process electricity requirement the capital cost of the naoh process was also found to be only 65 of that of the mea scrubbing process hosseinipour and mehrpooya 34 investigated amounts of electricity and heat demanded in the amine process 336 kw and it was twofold that of the naoh process 163 kw for the same biogas upgrading efficiency in addition preparing the absorbent solution by using groundwater as proposed in this study is both economically and environmentally advantageous 3 5 the simple scale up model by aspen hysys aspen hysys is a chemical process simulator used to mathematically model chemical processes from unit operations to full chemical plants and refineries hysys is used extensively in the industry and academia for steady state and dynamic simulation process design performance modeling and optimization it is important software for chemical process design 55 the simulation result described in previous section confirms that pure water naoh can be used as a representative of the groundwater naoh solution the pilot scale water scrubber was scaled up to commercial scale for a palm oil mill to support the maximum biogas feed rate of 500 m3 h the suitable l g ratio 0 3 corresponds to 150 m3 h of 4 g l naoh which was selected the scrubber diameter and the height along with the outlet biogas composition from the scale up simulation are shown in table 7 more results from the simulation are shown in the supplementary file 1 m diameter and 6 m height of packed column were estimated for 90 co2 and 99 99 h2s removal efficiency the height of packed column to diameter ratio is 6 1 in the modeled absorption process which is in the suggested range from 3 1 to 20 10 usual for absorption designs 56 the estimated packing media is plastic pall rings 25 mm the diameter of model absorption process to diameter of packing media is 40 generally design consideration of the ratio of tower diameter for random packing is greater than 10 57 the process parameters of the scaled up caustic scrubber are compared to the bio scrubber of factory in table 7 this indicates that the column size of the caustic tower was 30 fold smaller than the bio scrubber air is necessary for the bacteria to oxidize h2s to sulfur in the bio scrubber while it is unnecessary for chemical absorption 58 caustic scrubber can remove h2s to concentrations lower than 0 01 ppm while the bio scrubber claims 100 ppm the h2s tolerance for bio scrubber is 3000 ppm which is much lower than the designed maximum h2s of 13 000 ppm moreover both co2 and h2s can be effectively removed by using caustic scrubber while bio scrubber can remove only h2s however the scale up was performed with factor of 1 0 so that 6 8 g l naoh might be used to guarantee the removal efficiency it can be concluded that to produce bio methane the caustic scrubber using groundwater naoh could replace the softened water naoh scrubber and the bio scrubber 4 conclusions this study revealed that groundwater could replace softened water in preparing naoh solution as an absorbent to capture co2 and h2s from the biogas of a palm oil mill apart from ph alkalinity of the absorbent also plays an important role in co2 and h2s absorption various biogas flow rates solution flow rates and naoh concentrations affected co2 and h2s removal efficiencies and were experimentally explored the lowest l g ratios suggested for 100 99 h2s removal efficiency with 80 100 co2 removal efficiency at different naoh concentrations were tabulated for a simple selection of each bio methane grade the simulation by aspen hysys using pure water as a solvent showed a good agreement with the scrubbing experiments that used groundwater the caustic scrubber was then simulated for the 500 m3 h biogas production rate it was found that 30 fold smaller caustic scrubber in volume is needed compared to the current bio scrubber of the factory which provides no co2 removal this study obviously supports the potential of a caustic scrubber to substitute for a bio scrubber but a cost analysis throughout the process is still needed in a further study funding

13305,a caustic absorbent like naoh used in biogas upgrading can be recycled by regeneration at a moderate temperature using untreated groundwater to prepare the absorbent is cost saving but the of co2 and h2s removal efficiencies from biogas need to be confirmed 60 experiments were performed in pilot scale scrubber for data on operating conditions vs removal efficiency it was found that the removal efficiencies were not significantly different between using groundwater and softened water to prepare the naoh even though 0 3 0 4 of precipitate was found in naoh solution when using groundwater 99 removal efficiencies of co2 and h2s were achieved at the minimum naoh concentration of 4 g l and l g ratio of 0 3 the operating conditions for specific biomethane concentration requirements are tabulated and the relation of operating conditions to co2 removal efficiency is provided as an empirical correlation moreover there was a good agreement between the experimental data and the simulation by aspen hysys using the acid gas caustic wash method the caustic scrubber was then simulated for the 500 m3 h biogas production rate and the chosen column diameter and height were 1 m and 6 m respectively which is 30 fold smaller in volume compared to the bio scrubber for which no co2 removal was observed for bio methane production this study reveals the potential to use a cost saving caustic scrubber to replace the bio scrubber graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords groundwater bio methane biogas upgrading absorption scrubbing 1 introduction the public enterprises and industries are very interested in waste treatment and in utilizing wastes for biogas production the typical biogas mainly consists of 50 75 methane ch4 25 50 carbon dioxide co2 1500 3000 ppm hydrogen sulfide h2s and ammonia nh3 nitrogen n2 and water vapor 1 2 biogas upgrading by removing non fuel and hazardous contaminants such as co2 and h2s is crucial thus a high concentration of ch4 makes biogas an attractive fuel and solves problems from emissions of ch4 as a greenhouse gas that are several times more harmful than emissions of co2 3 the advantages of purifying biogas are in increasing the quality of fuel gas reducing transportation costs preventing corrosion of metal equipment and reducing health hazards 4 the biogas of improved quality can be applied as natural gas for example in ng converted vehicles or used to produce electricity with gas turbines because biogas is a high octane fuel that can easily be used in spark ignition si engines 5 6 several alternative technologies of physical biological and chemical types have been reported for the removal co2 and h2s 7 pressure swing adsorption is suitable for small or medium plant capacity requires high investment process control and operational costs and ch4 can be lost when valves malfunction 8 membrane separation is proper for a small to mid scale operation with low gas flow rate but it has low selectivity expensive operation and complex maintenance 9 cryogenic separation operates under very low temperature 170 c and high pressure 80 bars main units turbines heat exchangers distillation columns and compressors are necessary for cryogenic separation the capital and operational costs rise with high energy requirements expensive investment and operation 10 water scrubbing at high pressure has a high operation cost due to large electricity consumption and has ch4 losses water scrubbing at atmospheric pressure is limited to small installations and is not generally commercially supplied because a high liquid to biogas flow ratio is required 11 the type of technique implemented depends on economic factors such as investment costs operational costs maintenance costs or possibly ecological issues around the factory location 12 the biogas produced in palm oil industries is mostly used for electricity generation the maintenance costs for reciprocating engines increase with h2s concentration in the feed gas and the limit imposed on h2s concentration depends on engine specifications but below 100 ppm h2s has been suggested 13 for use in gas engine the removal of co2 is unnecessary 14 apart from using biogas to generate electricity compressed biomethane gas cbg is an alternative biogas product after the co2 and h2s are removed the biogas can be used to produce cbg which can substitute for ng cng or even lpg the biogas is a type of high octane fuel that can be easily used in spark ignition si engines compared to lpg and ng biogas has a much lower flame speed and a lower heating value these physical and chemical characteristics have great influences on the applications of biogas in si engines 15 cbg was promoted to replace lpg in heating or vehicle usage it is almost 20 lighter than air which is an advantage over lpg when a car has been in an accident or there is otherwise a fuel leak cbg will rise up in the air while lpg will float over the ground cbg has an ignition temperature of 650 750 c which is higher than the autoignition temperature of lpg so it also has a safety advantage in this respect 16 nowadays there is no standard requirement for cbg in thailand the minimum ch4 and maximum co2 in cbg differ in many standard requirements such as those of the us and the eu most palm oil mills use bio scrubber and bio filter to remove h2s from biogas in a bio filter system air must be also fed for the subsistence of sulfur oxidizing bacteria sob 17 18 one problem encountered in a long term operation of the biological system for biogas treatment is the blockages in the column due to sulfur sludge and microbial cell growth 19 20 the fouling in column leads to increased pressure drop due to excess biomass increased packing material compaction in the scrubber and reduced mass transfer rate of h2s to liquids with loss of efficiency and rate of h2s removal 21 22 sulfur sludge discharged from the bioreactor must be removed in an environment conscious manner effluent of bio scrubber or bio filter is laden with salts cod and has a low ph making it hard to degrade biologically this may lead to the formation of odors in anaerobic conditions in addition the use of biological systems has a disadvantage in terms of system stability and slow removal rates requiring large columns for prolonged gas retention chemical absorption is a promising approach for overcoming the problems in using bio scrubber the reactor configurations and the operating procedures in chemical absorption and in bio scrubber are similar therefore chemical absorption could replace an existing bio scrubber the main absorbent used in chemical scrubbing is amine 23 24 25 26 however amine is toxic expensive and degradable naoh and na2co3 are simple chemicals that are less toxic less expensive and less degradable than an amine derivative solution making these more attractive moreover the required naoh amount to remove a certain quantity of co2 or h2s is less than that of mea 27 the economic viability of the naoh and mea processes are compared to investigate the effect of choice between mea and naoh on the process economics naoh process is suggested high sustainability potential because it reduces the parasitic energy requirements and high initial capital cost associated with mea scrubbing in regeneration pressure of 1 5 3 bars and temperature of 120 160 c 26 28 in addition h2s rich biogas must be pre treated for h2s removal using activated carbon filters to avoid toxic build up in the amine reagents if h2s is absorbed desorption of h2s from the solvent post scrubbing requires more energy 29 naoh has been reviewed as an efficient co2 absorber and is conventionally used in a packed column in many studies 30 31 the method has been claimed to allow for high rate capture of co2 when using naoh at a low pressure drop allowing reduced capital cost and decreased water loss 32 33 recently it has been reported that spent naoh discharge from biogas scrubber is regenerable by using moderate thermal treatment 34 rattanaya et al 35 report that the naoh solution recovery is achieved experimentally at 95 c and 0 6 bar vacuum level by using a batch reactor and heat jacket the co2 and h2s removal efficiencies of naoh solution before and after the recovery are similar at 80 and 99 respectively generally diverse types of water such as tap water softened water or process water can be used as a solvent for the naoh solution however some factories use pretreated groundwater for the production process groundwater usually contains several ion species depending on the location 36 these ions must be removed to prevent contamination of the main product to reduce water pretreatment costs the idea to use raw groundwater for naoh solution is interesting however the efficiency of groundwater naoh solution for biogas upgrading needs to be investigated biogas flow rate absorbent flow rate and concentration column dimensions and packing material are important factors that affect h2s and co2 removal from biogas 37 38 39 theoretically the absorber operating conditions can be designed for a desired biogas outlet quality however experiments with varied operating conditions can probe the correlation between the operating conditions and the h2s and co2 removal efficiencies 40 characteristics of groundwater vary by location so the properties of a specific groundwater naoh absorbent and its ability to upgrade biogas quality are needed for scale up this research aimed to improve the biogas quality to produce cbg by getting rid of co2 and h2s by caustic absorption the efficiency of a caustic solution untreated groundwater naoh solution or softened water naoh solution was compared pilot scale packed column was operated at various biogas flow rates g naoh solution flow rates l and naoh concentrations c to explore the correlation between the operating conditions and the h2s and co2 removal efficiencies the scale up was further estimated based on data obtained from the pilot scale experiments with simulations in aspen hysys in order to compare the efficiency with bio scrubber of the factory 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials biogas 56 3 ch4 35 1 co2 8 37 air and 2300 ppm h2s produced form palm oil mill effluent at phrasaeng green power company limited surat thani thailand was used in the absorption experiments commercial grade solid sodium hydroxide was used to prepare absorbent solution groundwater and softened water from the factory were used for preparing the naoh solutions 2 2 system details and experimental 1 2 4 10 and 20 g l naoh solutions were prepared by using groundwater while only 4 g l naoh was prepared using softened water for solvent comparison test the precipitates developed during naoh solution preparation were collected and dried before analyzing the chemical compositions and crystal structures filter cloth was installed before the pump inlet to prevent the precipitates from entering the absorption system absorption system was set up at phrasaeng green power company limited surat thani thailand fig 1 shows absorption system diagram including 1 acrylic column 10 cm inside diameter 200 cm height packed to 140 cm height with pall rings 1 25 cm 2 200 l plastic absorbent storage tank 3 liquid rotameter 4 gas rotameter 5 pump 6 gas sampling valve 7 liquid sampling valve 8 water bath 9 blower 10 biogas plant and 11 used absorbent tank the temperature of field biogas was controlled at 35 c by passing the gas pipeline in a water bath before feeding to the bottom of packed column while the naoh solution was pumped from the storage tank to the top of the packed column the biogas and solution flow rates were measured and controlled by rotameters inlet and outlet biogas samples were collected at 5 10 and 15 min using an air sampling pump for analyzing the biogas composition inlet and outlet naoh solution samples were collected at 5 10 and 15 min for the measurement of ph alkalinity bicarbonate carbonate hydroxide and total sulfide the effects of various operating parameters naoh concentration 1 20 g l biogas flow rate 300 900 l h absorbent flow rate 60 180 l h and sources of water used to prepare naoh solution groundwater and softened water were studied 2 3 analytical methods gas compositions co2 h2s ch4 and o2 in biogas during absorption were measured with a gas analyzer gmf 416 portable multi channel handheld gas analyzer and selected gas samples were also measured by gas chromatography with a thermal conductivity detector in order to assess accuracy of the gas analyzer the chemical composition of precipitate during the preparation of naoh solution was measured by x ray fluorescence spectrometry xrf x ray fluorescence spectrometer zetium panalytical while the detailed phase and structural information of precipitate was analyzed by using x ray diffraction xrd x ray diffractometer empyrean panalytical the total suspended solids in the naoh solution was tested by evaporation in a weighted dish and drying to a constant weight apha and awwa 1997 the ph of the naoh solution was measured using a standard ph meter ph benchtop meter hanna hi522 alkalinity of the absorbed solution sample was measured by titration with a volumetrically standardized sulfuric acid solution using end point indicators and or ph meter aoac official method 973 43 concentrations of bicarbonate ion hco3 carbonate co3 2 and hydroxide ion oh were estimated from ph and titration volume using the equation proposed by apha 1985 total sulfide s dissolved h2s bisulfide ion hs and sulfide ion s2 of absorbed solution sample were analyzed with the iodometric method apha awwa and wpcf 1998 by volumetrically standardized sodium thiosulfate solution based on the amount of iodine remaining after reacting with sulfide all experimental data were subjected to two way analysis of variance anova with statistical significance set at 95 confidence level 2 4 removal efficiency calculation and overall height of the gas film transfer unit h og co2 and h2s removal efficiency was calculated using eqs 1 and 2 1 c o 2 removal efficiency c o 2 in c o 2 out c o 2 in 100 where co 2 in and co 2 out are the percentages of co2 in the inlet and outlet biogases respectively 2 h 2 s removal efficiency h 2 s in h 2 s out h 2 s in 100 where h 2 s in and h 2 s out are the h2s concentrations ppm in the inlet and outlet biogases respectively apart from the removal efficiency the absorber performance could be more reliable in terms of h og the smaller h og is the more efficient is interfacial contact allowing in turn less packed height the h og can be estimated by eq 3 3 h og z n og where z is packed bed height and n og is the number of the gas film transfer units and can be calculated as in eq 4 4 n og y out y in dy y ln y in y out where y in and y out is percentages of solute in the inlet and outlet biogases respectively n og depends only on the inlet and outlet concentrations of the solute and applies only when the equilibrium line is straight and the slope approaches zero for very soluble the reaction of co2 and h2s with the naoh is rapid and the balance with a solution tends to zero 41 2 5 multiple linear regressions performed using the r program the relationship of co2 removal efficiency with the operating conditions was fit by multiple linear regressions using the r program 2 6 simulation and simple scale up the performance of absorption process using groundwater as solvent for the naoh solution was compared with the simulation of aspen hysys at the same conditions scale up for a maximum biogas flow rate of 500 m3 h generated from the biogas plant of phrasaeng green power company limited was estimated by aspen hysys as shown in fig 2 the process output from the scale up simulation was compared with bio scrubber of the factory 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristic of the naoh solutions as shown in table 1 the groundwater has hardness 320 mg l as caco3 which is 10 times higher than hardness of the softened water hardness is possibly caused by the dissolved salts caco3 ca hco3 2 mgco3 mg hco3 2 cacl2 caso4 mgcl2 and mgso4 white precipitate was observed during the preparation of groundwater naoh solution while the softened water naoh solution remained clear however the precipitate had a very high sedimentation rate and was easily separated from the solution as higher concentrations of naoh were pursued more precipitation occurred at a high concentration of naoh solution 20 g l the total suspended solids were 4 365 g l or about 0 4 as shown in table 1 the chemical composition of precipitate was characterized as shown in table 2 the main inorganic element present in the precipitates was ca with smaller amounts of mg and si and trace amounts of na al p s k ti fe zn as sr and ba from xrd analysis it was confirmed that the precipitate consisted mainly of calcite caco3 and brucite mg oh 2 it is worth noting that when thermal regeneration of spent naoh is applied in the absorption process only a little groundwater is needed for make up of the absorbent volume 35 therefore precipitation might occur only in the first cycle of naoh preparation moreover no heavy metals were detected in the precipitate so handling this precipitate is comparatively easy theoretically ph of the naoh solution can be calculated from its concentration in pure water the impurities in water led to ph differing from the calculation results at 4 g l naoh 0 1 m in pure water the ph should be 13 a lower ph of 12 64 was measured for the groundwater naoh solution this complements the xrd results mentioned above namely that the hydroxide species precipitated with the hardness cations the ph of softened water naoh solution was 12 89 in most cases ph of an absorbent is considered a crucial parameter in acidic gas absorption and a higher ph of the absorbent should give increased removal efficiency 42 43 alkalinity of solution demonstrates the capacity of water to resist acidification or the strength of a buffer solution thus for acid gas removal the alkalinity of an absorbent should be also considered the alkaline species of co3 2 hco3 and oh are measured and calculated in table 1 total alkalinity of the groundwater is 270 mg caco3 l and only hco3 group was found total alkalinity of the naoh solution increased with the naoh amount the total alkalinity with 1 20 g l ranged within 1425 24 410 mg l the hco3 group decreased with concentration of naoh because the hco3 was converted to co3 2 at 4 g l naoh in solution there were almost twice as many alkalinity groups oh in the softened water naoh solution than in groundwater naoh solution this matched the observed higher ph of softened water naoh solution in contrast the alkalinity groups co3 2 and hco in the softened water naoh solution were found in lesser amounts than in groundwater naoh solution the total alkalinities of groundwater naoh solution and softened water naoh solution were 5200 mg l and 4915 mg l respectively normally higher ph of an absorbent will give higher acid gas removal efficiency however the buffer capacity which can be expressed in terms of total alkalinity is also worth consideration there is lack of research reporting on this point of view this study investigated the effects of different alkalinities and ph levels for the two types of absorbent 3 2 co2 and h2s removal efficiencies of groundwater the performance in biogas upgrading using groundwater naoh solution is shown in terms of co2 and h2s removal efficiencies in fig 3 increasing the biogas flow rate from 300 to 900 l h caused the co2 removal efficiency to obviously decrease when 1 10 g l naoh solutions were used when the biogas flow rate is increased the retention time of biogas in the system is reduced and the contact time of gas phase with liquid phase is shorter in addition increasing the biogas flow rate means that the co2 mass entering per unit time is also increased so the molar ratio of co2 and naoh increased which will degrade ability of the solution to capture co2 44 when naoh concentration increased the loss in co2 removal with biogas flow rate decreased co2 removal efficiencies were independent to the biogas flow rates at excess naoh loading with a concentration of 20 g l in contrast co2 removal efficiency increased when solution flow rate and concentration increased because the molar ratio of naoh to captured co2 increased the increasing trend of co2 removal efficiency with solution flow rate decreased with naoh concentration co2 removal efficiencies were also independent to the solution flow rates at excess naoh loading with concentration of 20 g l as shown in fig 4 higher than 97 h2s removal efficiencies were observed at all operating conditions the h2s removal efficiency was higher than that of co2 due to much lower h2s content in the biogas and moreover the water solubility of h2s is higher than that of co2 removing co2 could improve the calorific value of the biogas 45 the biogas burns very well when the ch4 content is higher than 50 and the combustion temperature and heating value increase with ch4 content in the biogas 46 the bio methane can replace diesel and ngv as vehicle fuels the bio methane with at least 80 of ch4 can be injected to the grid in netherland while in sweden and switzerland the ch4 content requirements are higher at 95 and 96 of ch4 respectively for france and austria the co2 content should be below 2 while in germany the co2 content is not more than 6 therefore the lowest l g ratio for 100 h2s removal efficiency with 80 90 or 100 co2 removal efficiency at different naoh concentrations retrieved from this study is summarized in table 3 l g ratio is a useful dimensionless parameter for operating the absorber l g has to be optimized to prevent low absorption efficiency from too low l g loading and to prevent increased pressure drop across the absorption and excess chemical use from too high l g loading moreover the empirical correlations for dependence of co2 removal efficiency on the operating conditions l g and c were fit using multiple linear regressions all the pilot experiments providing 99 h2s removal efficiency were input to the regression and the simple model obtained is shown in eq 5 5 c o 2 removal 598 135 c 0 1772 l 1 36 g 47 855 multiple r 2 0 8082 approximately 80 of the variation in co2 removal efficiency r2 0 8082 with r2 adjusted of 79 52 was explained by the multiple linear regression model all three parameters affected the co2 removal efficiency significantly the concentration of naoh and biogas flow rate were significant at p values 2 98 10 14 and 2 81 10 9 respectively the solution flow rate was a minor independent variable at p 0 00489 pr 0 001 this correlation is useful for the removal efficiency prediction and the operating condition selection in the pilot scale absorption system 3 3 mass distributions in the gas and liquid phases after co2 and h2s were absorbed by the naoh solution the ph of the effluent had decreased firstly absorbed co2 reacts with oh to generate co3 2 after that the co3 2 could also react with the entering co2 and can be converted to hco3 as in eqs 6 7 similarly in h2s absorption the s2 and hs will be present in the absorbed solution as in eqs 8 9 the proportions of oh co3 2 hco3 s2 and hs depend on ph of the solution higher hco3 and hs are usually found at a low ph 6 c o 2 2 o h c o 3 2 h 2 o 7 co 2 c o 3 2 h 2 o 2 hc o 3 8 h 2 s o h hs h 2 o 9 hs h 2 o oh s 2 2 h 2 o alkalinity species and sulfide concentration in the pilot scale scrubber effluent were measured and are presented in table 4 total alkalinity oh co3 2 hco3 of the scrubber effluent was not significantly different from the scrubber influent because the ph of the effluent was greater than 7 0 however the oh concentration had decreased while co3 2 hco3 had increased the result is similar to rattanaya et al 47 in which they compared using alkaline absorbent extracted from ash and naoh to remove co2 the naoh solution was adjusted to ph 12 4 which was ph of the alkaline ash solution the results showed that the total alkalinities before and after the absorption column were not significantly different but the form of alkalinity had changed from oh and co3 2 to hco3 species the co2 removal efficiency using alkaline ash solution which had more alkalinity was higher than with the naoh solution it can be concluded that the amount of alkalinity in the solution affects the absorption process more than ph rattanaya et al 35 reported that to regenerate the spent naoh by a thermal method a suitable alkalinity of co3 2 hco3 is above 5000 mg l therefore the naoh concentrations below 4 g l are not proper for the process using thermal regeneration oh will not be regenerated by thermal process as proposed by rattanaya et al 35 so the naoh solutions with excess concentration 10 and 20 g l are not considered in further discussion at 4 g l naoh concentration 300 l h biogas flow rate and 90 l h solution flow rate were selected as the optimum conditions providing 99 co2 and h2s removal efficiencies the mass distribution at this operating condition is illustrated in fig 5 in the gas phase 35 of co2 in biogas with 300 l h came into absorber corresponding to 3442 mg co2 entering 0 75 co2 in the outlet biogas equals 51 mg co2 thus 3390 mg of co2 had disappeared from the gas phase and should be detected in the effluent there were in total 1996 mg co2 contained in the influent naoh solution from mass balance calculation the total co2 in the effluent should be 3390 1996 5386 mg but only 4195 mg co2 in the effluent were detected the 1092 mg of co2 were lost maybe because pressure inside the column was higher than outside so the co2 could be partly released from the solution to the atmosphere similar mechanisms could be acting in the mass distribution of sulfide species between gas and liquid phases in our absorber 3 4 comparison of different sources of water to prepare naoh solution the efficiency of removing co2 and h2s by naoh solutions prepared with different sources of water were investigated groundwater and softened water were used as solvents in the pilot scale experiments while pure water was used for the process simulation at the optimum operating conditions of 300 l h of biogas flow rate 90 l h of the naoh solution and 4 g l naoh concentration the corresponding removal efficiencies are shown in table 5 it is confirmed that even though softened water naoh had ph 11 70 which is higher than the ph of groundwater naoh 10 56 still due to the groundwater naoh solution having higher alkalinity the co2 and h2s removal from biogas were similar 98 5 using the softened water naoh achieved about 1 higher removal efficiency than groundwater naoh solution this obviously confirms that the groundwater without any pretreatment can be utilized as a water source to prepare naoh solution for the biogas scrubber the biogas absorption process was simulated at the same scrubber configuration and operating conditions except for the water source for preparing an absorbent softened water or groundwater with diverse characteristic are not in the database of aspen hysys so pure water was chosen as a solvent for naoh solution the simulated results showed co2 and h2s removal efficiencies not significantly different from the experiments the differences in co2 and h2s removal efficiencies by absorption with groundwater naoh solution compared with pure water naoh solution were only 0 84 and 1 09 respectively which are acceptable in addition normally the moisture content will have increased in the biogas at scrubber outlet from the simulation the moisture content had 3 53 increases at the outlet however because moisture content in the biogas was not determined and also the moisture in the biogas was removed before the determination of biogas composition the composition of the outlet biogas from the experiment is presented only on a dry basis it can be observed that the air entering in biogas is absorbed into the solution after the process while in the experiments the air is still present in the outlet biogas this indicates that the naoh in the experiment was receiving air from atmosphere during preparation and pumping processes moreover the profile of ch4 co2 and h2s along the packed column height was also simulated as shown in fig 6 the simulation shows that to obtain 99 co2 and h2s removal efficiency 1 12 m packed height is sufficient while the experimental operating conditions had 1 40 m packed height thus it is worth noting that for the further simulated scale up a safety factor larger than 1 25 is suggested generally with a larger packed column height and gas liquid contact surface increase improved removal efficiency is achieved h og indicates the efficiency with packed height considered 48 a lower h og indicates more effective operation at the same gas flow rate input because a lower packing height is required for the same removal efficiency table 6 compares the efficiencies of co2 and h2s removal from biogas in our study to previous literature on chemical scrubbing the co2 and h2s efficiencies in terms of h og when using groundwater naoh in this study is competitive when compared to other studies h og can be decreased by lowering the inlet gas flow rate lowering the co2 and h2s concentrations raising the solution concentration or increasing the solution inlet flow rate in terms of a techno economic assessment naoh and mea processes were investigated by yusuf et al 28 the naoh process would result in significant energy savings the electricity demand of the naoh process was 35 kwh t co2 which was just 7 of the mea process electricity requirement the capital cost of the naoh process was also found to be only 65 of that of the mea scrubbing process hosseinipour and mehrpooya 34 investigated amounts of electricity and heat demanded in the amine process 336 kw and it was twofold that of the naoh process 163 kw for the same biogas upgrading efficiency in addition preparing the absorbent solution by using groundwater as proposed in this study is both economically and environmentally advantageous 3 5 the simple scale up model by aspen hysys aspen hysys is a chemical process simulator used to mathematically model chemical processes from unit operations to full chemical plants and refineries hysys is used extensively in the industry and academia for steady state and dynamic simulation process design performance modeling and optimization it is important software for chemical process design 55 the simulation result described in previous section confirms that pure water naoh can be used as a representative of the groundwater naoh solution the pilot scale water scrubber was scaled up to commercial scale for a palm oil mill to support the maximum biogas feed rate of 500 m3 h the suitable l g ratio 0 3 corresponds to 150 m3 h of 4 g l naoh which was selected the scrubber diameter and the height along with the outlet biogas composition from the scale up simulation are shown in table 7 more results from the simulation are shown in the supplementary file 1 m diameter and 6 m height of packed column were estimated for 90 co2 and 99 99 h2s removal efficiency the height of packed column to diameter ratio is 6 1 in the modeled absorption process which is in the suggested range from 3 1 to 20 10 usual for absorption designs 56 the estimated packing media is plastic pall rings 25 mm the diameter of model absorption process to diameter of packing media is 40 generally design consideration of the ratio of tower diameter for random packing is greater than 10 57 the process parameters of the scaled up caustic scrubber are compared to the bio scrubber of factory in table 7 this indicates that the column size of the caustic tower was 30 fold smaller than the bio scrubber air is necessary for the bacteria to oxidize h2s to sulfur in the bio scrubber while it is unnecessary for chemical absorption 58 caustic scrubber can remove h2s to concentrations lower than 0 01 ppm while the bio scrubber claims 100 ppm the h2s tolerance for bio scrubber is 3000 ppm which is much lower than the designed maximum h2s of 13 000 ppm moreover both co2 and h2s can be effectively removed by using caustic scrubber while bio scrubber can remove only h2s however the scale up was performed with factor of 1 0 so that 6 8 g l naoh might be used to guarantee the removal efficiency it can be concluded that to produce bio methane the caustic scrubber using groundwater naoh could replace the softened water naoh scrubber and the bio scrubber 4 conclusions this study revealed that groundwater could replace softened water in preparing naoh solution as an absorbent to capture co2 and h2s from the biogas of a palm oil mill apart from ph alkalinity of the absorbent also plays an important role in co2 and h2s absorption various biogas flow rates solution flow rates and naoh concentrations affected co2 and h2s removal efficiencies and were experimentally explored the lowest l g ratios suggested for 100 99 h2s removal efficiency with 80 100 co2 removal efficiency at different naoh concentrations were tabulated for a simple selection of each bio methane grade the simulation by aspen hysys using pure water as a solvent showed a good agreement with the scrubbing experiments that used groundwater the caustic scrubber was then simulated for the 500 m3 h biogas production rate it was found that 30 fold smaller caustic scrubber in volume is needed compared to the current bio scrubber of the factory which provides no co2 removal this study obviously supports the potential of a caustic scrubber to substitute for a bio scrubber but a cost analysis throughout the process is still needed in a further study funding

13306,advanced technologies to remove organic micropollutants omps from municipal wastewater have gained much attention over the last decades adsorption by zeolites is one of these technologies in this study the regeneration performance of well tailored granular zeolites loaded with omps was evaluated the selected omps were categorized into three groups due to the adsorption performance high medium and low adsorbance gaseous ozone was directly applied to regenerate dried zeolite granules at an ozone concentration of 30 mg l and a gas flow rate of 0 2 l min 0 04 m s for the high and medium adsorbing omps 45 min of ozonation was long enough to fully restore their adsorption capacity for the low adsorbing omps the regeneration efficiency reached 60 after 60 min of ozonation interestingly their recovered adsorption capacities firstly decreased and subsequently increased along with the ozonation duration the dramatically decrease was most probably due to the presence of the transformation products generated from the ozonation of some selected omps in seven sequential adsorption regeneration cycles the adsorption capacity for 75 of the selected omps was fully recovered at an ozonation duration of 60 min in each regeneration the assumed accumulation of the ozonation transformation products only influenced the adsorption of low adsorbing omps in 7 cycles graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords adsorption granular zeolites organic micropollutants ozone based regeneration transformation products 1 introduction the presence of organic micropollutants omps in the aquatic environment has become an increasing problem for the quality of aquatic ecosystems and for the production of drinking water from surface water in the last decades omps comprise pharmaceuticals plant protection products personal care products and industrial chemicals many enter the aquatic environment via municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps 1 omps occur in water bodies at trace levels between few ng l and several μg l the low concentration both increases the difficulties of detection and analysis and also brings challenges for wastewater treatment 2 municipal wwtps are designed to control a wide range of substances including particulates carbonaceous substances nutrients and pathogens these substances can be efficiently and consistently eliminated 2 however traditional wwtps are not specifically designed for the removal of omps 3 and the average removal efficiency ranges from 30 to 65 4 thus many of the omps pass through the wastewater treatment processes the occurrence of omps and their fate and removal from wastewater were reviewed in many studies in the last decades 1 9 omps are becoming a severe threat to the aquatic life as it is associated with many negative effects such as short term and long term toxicity endocrine disrupting effects and antibiotic resistance of microorganisms 10 for this reason the dutch ministry of infrastructure and water management lists 11 compounds as target substances to monitor the effectiveness of novel treatment technologies for removal of omps from wastewater 11 adsorption is an effective technology to remove omps activated carbons are widely used as adsorbents to treat municipal wastewater 12 13 currently ozonation followed by granular activated carbon filtration is applied to remove pharmaceuticals from municipal treatment effluents 12 after the adsorbent is exhausted it has to be regenerated or replaced to regain the adsorption capacity thermal reactivation is commonly used to regenerate exhausted activated carbons 14 as an alternative oxidative technologies especially ozonation are promisingly able to regenerate the exhausted adsorbents 15 however ozone can attack and destroy the structure of activated carbons 16 thus ozonation is not suitable for regeneration of activated carbons recently hydrophobic zeolites were evaluated as alternative adsorbents their structure with uniform small pores a few å makes them attractive for selective uptake of omps from the wastewater containing natural organic matters nom 17 18 moreover ozonation can effectively regenerate zeolites after adsorption of omps without changing their structure properties 19 however a limited number of studies are available and they all focus on the regeneration of powdered zeolites by ozone in the water phase zsm 5 zeolite with high ratio of si al was capable to highly concentrate the ozone dissolved in water 20 this property was able to promote the removal of trichloroethene 2 methylisoborneol and ibuprofen during simultaneously injections of both ozone dissolved water and pollutant feed water to a zeolite packed column 21 23 reungoat et al 24 found that

reported some studies reported about applying ozone in the water phase an effective adsorption of trichlorophenol was kept in 8 cycles by using fau granular zeolites and an ozone bubbling system 15 however this study was carried out in semi batch mode this study proposed an interesting hypothesis that the intermediates formed in ozonation might influence the adsorption capacity of trichlorophenol unfortunately further identification was missing to prove this hypothesis by simultaneously applying adsorption and ozonation in a fixed bed column packed with fau granules the removal performance of nitrobenzene was enhanced 25 a study of zhang et al 26 reported about sequential adsorption regeneration in which ozone was applied in the gas phase the regeneration process was carried in a column packed with dried zeolite granules the granules consisted of only one type of zeolite fau the adsorption capacity of trichlorophenol on fau granules noticeably increased in three adsorption regeneration cycles 26 an intensive interaction of ozone and zeolite was hypothesized our previous study found that the adsorption capacity of acetaminophen on fau granules was effective in 3 cycles 27 this study revealed that lower water content in granules significantly increased the ozone based regeneration performance applying ozone in the gas phase the current study aimed to evaluate the regeneration performance of well tailored zeolite granules loaded with omps in this study for the first time a mixture of three types of zeolites was prepared in granular form and applied to adsorb a broad range of omps from water after adsorption ozone based regeneration was conducted in the gas phase instead of the water phase as commonly applied this process set up using zeolites in the form of granules and ozone in the gas phase is promisingly applicable in water technology practice before applying for the treatment of real wastewater this study was a proof of principle starting with demi water eight omps were selected from the list requested by the dutch ministry of infrastructure and water management 11 sotalol metoprolol trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole benzotriazole methyl benzotriazole carbamazepine and diclofenac respectively the objectives of this study were firstly to study the adsorption performance of the selected omps on zeolite granules by conducting adsorption isotherms and kinetics tests secondly to determine the optimum loading duration thirdly to assess the regeneration performance at varying ozonation durations fourthly to discuss the influence of the ozonation transformation products on the adsorption capacity and finally to study the change in adsorption capacity for the selected omps in seven sequential adsorption regeneration cycles at the optimum loading and regeneration duration for an overall evaluation of the long term performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 zeolite adsorbents high silica zeolite powders were supplied by tosoh

zeolites are evaluated as good adsorbents to uptake omps 18 29 zeolite with higher ratio of si al was more efficient to adsorb omps 24 the characterizations of the selected high silica zeolites were studied in a previous study done by our research group 29 their chemical characteristics are listed in table 1 granular zeolites were produced by a 3d clay printer supplied by vormvrij zeolite powders of bea mor and mfi were firstly mixed uniformly with a mass ratio of 1 1 1 bentonite sigma aldrich as a binder was added at 15 by weight after adding demi water the uniformly mixed paste was packed in the cartridge of the 3d clay printer the paste was extruded out in grain form as pre programmed in the software the size of the granules was 1 mm in diameter and 2 3 mm in length thereafter the granules were sintered at 950 c for 2 h to enhance the mechanical strength 2 2 organic micropollutants all the selected omps were purchased from sigma aldrich their physicochemical and structural properties are listed in table 2 2 3 adsorption tests all the adsorption tests were carried out in batch mode at 20 c prior to the adsorption tests eight selected omps were spiked to demi water at 4 5 μg l the effect of ozone on the adsorption behaviour of zeolites was studied the detailed ozone treatment procedure is described in section 2 4 2 3 1 determination of the effect of ozone on adsorption 2 g of fresh granules were packed in a column which was 10 mm in diameter and 25 cm in length the granules were treated by gaseous ozone for 1 h at an ozone concentration of 90 mg l and a flow rate of 0 8 l min 0 16 m s after gaseous ozone treatment various amounts ranging from 0 to 1 g l of fresh and ozone treated granules were added to several 1 l glass bottles to obtain equilibrium adsorption in a short time the granules were pulverized in the bottles before adding 1 l prepared omps solution the solutions were stirred at 200 rpm for 48 h to obtain equilibrium adsorption before and after adsorption water samples were taken and measured with lc ms to determine the concentrations of omps 2 3 2 determination of optimum loading duration to determine the optimum loading duration 0 5 g of fresh granules were dosed to 1 l prepared omps solution the solution was stirred at 100 120 rpm for 288 h at this low stirring rate the full granules remained at the bottom of the bottle while only the solution was moving in the bottle this was to prevent any abrasion of the granules during adsorption water samples were taken at different time intervals the concentrations of omps in the samples were measured with lc ms 2 4 ozone based regeneration ozone based regeneration tests were carried out in a column packed with zeolite granules loaded with omps using the optimum loading duration determined as described in section 2 3 2 gaseous ozone was introduced in down flow mode in the column the size of the column was 10 mm in diameter and 25 cm in length an ozone set up supplied by wedeco xylem water solutions herford gmbh was installed in a fume hood an ozone generator modular 4 hc produced ozone from pure oxygen the maximum ozone production was 4 g h two ozone analysers bmt 964 messtechnik gmbh were applied to monitor the ozone concentration of the feed gas and the outflow the experimental set up was illustrated in our previous research 27 the regeneration performance was determined by comparing the omps loading on zeolite granules before and after regeneration the omps loading was measured in a limited amount of adsorption time derived from section 2 3 2 2 4 1 optimum ozonation duration the adsorption before regeneration was conducted by adding 0 5 g of fresh zeolite granules to 1 l prepared omps solution the adsorption process was run for the same duration as the optimum loading duration obtained from section 2 3 2 after adsorption the granules were dried at 50 c in the oven overnight dried granules were packed in the column for regeneration varying ozonation durations from 0 to 60 min were applied the gaseous ozone conditions were set at an ozone concentration of 30 mg l and a gas flow rate of 0 2 l min 0 04 m s after regeneration the granules were collected for the second adsorption with the same procedure to obtain the loading water samples were taken before and after each adsorption the concentrations of omps in the samples were measured with lc ms 2 4 2 ozonation transformation products to further study the influence of the ozonation transformation products remaining in the granules pure methanol was applied to extract the possible transformation products from the granules that were used for different ozonation durations the granules were dried at 50 c in the oven overnight after the second adsorption dried granules were then pulverized and added to 100 ml pure methanol after stirring for 120 h liquid samples were taken and analysed with lc ms 2 4 3 long term adsorption regeneration the long term regeneration performance was evaluated in seven sequential adsorption regeneration cycles the sequential adsorption regeneration procedure is shown in fig 1 in each adsorption regeneration cycle the adsorption procedure was performed the same as aforementioned in section 2 4 1 the regeneration procedure lasted for 60 min with a total ozone dose of 0 36 g h the gaseous ozone conditions were set the same as described in section 2 4 1 water samples were taken before and after each adsorption the concentrations of omps in the samples were measured with lc ms all the adsorption and regeneration tests were conducted in triple 2 4 4 calculations relative adsorption capacity rq was introduced to represent the regeneration performance it was calculated by rq q n q 1 where q n μg g was the loading of the granules after a fixed time in the nth adsorption q 1 μg g was the loading of the fresh granules after a fixed time in the first adsorption when the rq reached 1 it indicated that the regeneration was successful and the adsorption capacity of zeolite granules was fully restored 2 5 lc ms analysis all the samples were filtered over 0 2 μm polycarbonate syringe filters before analysis the omps in demi water and methanol were analysed by a uplc ms ms system waters acquity uplc i class xevo tq s micro fitted with the esi equipped with a c18 column acquity uplc beh 2 1 50 mm 1 7 μm particle size the flow rate of the elution was set at 0 35 ml min with 95 ultrapure water acidified with 0 1 formic acid and 5 acetonitrile the oven temperature was 40 c ms provides a specific and sensitive detection of multiple omps the compounds are ionized first and separated based on their mass to charge ratios m z the mass spectrum at each retention time point provides the molecular mass and structural information an internal standard is for each omp was added in equal amount to both the calibration standards 0 0025 10 μg l and unknown samples by adding an is for quantitation the variations of the measurement can be corrected and then the accuracy of the results is improved 30 limits of detection lod and quantitation loq and the retention time for each compound are listed in table 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of loading duration the decrease of the concentrations of eight selected omps as a function of time is shown in fig 2 the eight omps were categorized into three groups by their removal efficiencies after 288 h adsorption sot mp and tmp were the high adsorbing omps their removal efficiencies were above 99 bt mebt and smx were the medium adsorbing omps for bt and smx their removal efficiencies were around 70 for mebt its removal efficiency was 88 the adsorption isotherms of the medium adsorbing omps were interpreted with the freundlich model fig s1 supplementary information cbz and dic were the low adsorbing omps their removal efficiencies were around 20 for the high adsorbing omps their concentrations decreased from around 4 μg l to 0 μg l after 120 h they were adsorbed faster than the other two categories for the medium adsorbing omps the adsorption equilibrium was reached after 250 h the concentration of mebt at the start was around 8 μg l as the same amounts of 4 mebt and 5 mebt were spiked in the solution the lc ms recognized them as the same compound the low adsorbing omps were slightly removed the concentration of cbz decreased from 4 μg l to 3 μg l after 120 h while the concentration of dic decreased from 4 μg l to 3 2 μg l after 240 h it indicated that all the high adsorbing omps were completely removed after 120 h adsorption the concentrations of the medium adsorbing omps still decreased slowly after 120 h while the concentrations of the low adsorbing omps remained constant the results suggest that the loading duration applied in the adsorption tests for the indication of regeneration performance is considered appropriate around 120 h if the loading duration was shorter than 120 h 50 h for instance the uptake of omps was still in the rapid adsorption zone the relative adsorption capacity for the high and medium adsorbing omps would be estimated high as there were many remaining available adsorption sites if the loading duration was longer than 120 h 200 h for instance the relative adsorption capacity for the target omps would be most likely close to 1 because the same loading of omps could be reached in a long adsorption duration with a slower adsorption rate in the second loading process after regeneration in both cases the regeneration performance could not be well determined 3 2 optimum ozone based regeneration duration the regeneration performance of zeolite granules loaded with omps at different ozonation durations is shown in figs 3 5 it is worth mentioning that gaseous ozone did not affect the adsorption capacity of omps on zeolite table s1 supplementary information the same results were also found in our previous study 27 for the high adsorbing omps their relative adsorption capacities rq remained 1 after all ozonation durations fig 3 it indicated that there were many adsorption sites available on zeolites for the high adsorbing omps therefore when no regeneration was applied the rq could also reach 1 the rq of the medium adsorbing omps gradually increased along with the ozonation duration fig 4 the rq of bt and mebt increased from 0 64 at 0 min ozonation to 1 at 45 min ozonation while the rq of smx increased from 0 84 at 0 min ozonation to 1 at 30 min ozonation the results indicated that 45 min of ozonation was long enough for the zeolite granules to restore the adsorption capacity of the high and medium adsorbing omps for the low adsorbing omps the rq reached around 0 6 at 60 min ozonation fig 5 a interestingly the rq of cbz reached 0 56 at 5 min ozonation and dramatically decreased from 0 56 to 0 24 at 20 min ozonation subsequently the rq increased to 0 59 at 60 min ozonation a similar pattern was found for dic the rq of dic reached 0 63 at 5 min ozonation decreased to 0 31 at 30 min ozonation and eventually reached 0 63 at 60 min ozonation to further study the influence of the ozonation duration the regeneration performance of the adsorption of only cbz instead of a mixture of omps is shown in fig 5b the rq of cbz increased from 0 15 to 0 7 at 10 min ozonation and remained around 0 53 at 20 min ozonation the assumption for the tendency of cbz in fig 5b was that at a short ozonation duration 10 min the adsorption sites on zeolites for cbz were released but not completely this was due to the rapid reaction of ozone and the double bond in cbz 31 meanwhile many transformation products containing quinazoline groups were generated during the ozonation of cbz 32 the ozonation transformation products of cbz adsorbed on zeolites and or the not long enough ozonation duration may result in a low rq around 0 5 after 60 min ozonation 3 3 influence of ozonation transformation products furthermore it can be hypothesized that the decrease of rq from 5 min to 20 min fig 5a was caused by the adsorption of transformation products generated in the ozonation of all eight omps which competed with cbz for adsorption sites subsequently the rq increased along with the decomposition of the ozonation transformation products at longer ozonation durations the results suggest that a longer ozonation duration of at least 60 min is needed for the granules to restore the adsorption capacity of the low adsorbing omps in addition the total ion chromatogram fig s2 supplementary information was acquired over a mass range of m z 50 400 in positive ion mode for the liquid samples after methanol extraction the peak curves in fig s2 were processed by subtracting the total ion chromatogram of fresh zeolite granules after comparing all the peaks of the curves after different ozonation durations the most interesting aspect of the data was at the retention time of 3 35 min along with the increase of the ozonation duration the intensity of the peak at 3 35 min started to increase after 5 min ozonation and reached the highest level at 20 min ozonation after 20 min ozonation the peak intensity decreased until 45 min ozonation this trend was reversely corresponding to the rq changes of cbz fig 5a the mass spectrums at the retention time of 3 35 min are shown in fig s3 supplementary information three ozonation transformation products were selected from the peaks their abbreviations were p213 p218 and p274 respectively the numbers refer to their m z obtained from the esi ms analysis the intensity of the three products after different ozonation durations are shown in fig 6 at 20 min ozonation the intensity of all the three products reached the highest level for p274 its intensity increased after 5 min ozonation and decreased after 20 min ozonation it is possible to hypothesize that the formation of p213 p218 and p274 might influence the adsorption capacity of cbz after different ozonation durations fig 5a moreover p274 might contain m273 c13h24no5 which was identified as an oxidation product formed in the ozonation of metoprolol 33 34 p274 might also contain dic p 273 9813 16 4 which was identified as a transformation product of diclofenac 35 it is worth mentioning that metoprolol is one of the high adsorbing omps and diclofenac is the other low adsorbing omp identifications of p213 and p218 were not found in the literature thus it can be further hypothesized that the ozonation transformation products formed in the reaction of ozone with the omps other than cbz might influence the adsorption capacity of cbz after different ozonation durations fig 5a 3 4 long term adsorption regeneration performance the regeneration performance of the high adsorbing omps in seven adsorption regeneration cycles is shown in fig 7 the rq was constant at 1 after 60 min of ozonation in seven cycles and the rq without regeneration was also approaching 1 in each cycle the difference of the rq between regeneration and without regeneration was smaller than 0 05 for each cycle the average adsorption capacities were 6 31 5 99 and 7 07 μg g for sot mp and tmp respectively the results indicated that huge amounts of adsorption sites for the high adsorbing omps were present in the zeolites therefore the rq can reach 1 after 7 cycles even without regeneration for the medium adsorbing omps the rq with regeneration remained at 1 in 7 cycles while the rq without regeneration gradually decreased in 7 cycles fig 8 after 7 cycles without regeneration the rq of bt decreased from 0 66 to 0 44 fig 8a the rq of mebt decreased from 0 61 to 0 5 fig 8b and the rq of smx decreased from 0 83 to 0 62 fig 8c the adsorption capacities of fresh granules were 4 85 6 5 and 4 01 μg g for bt mebt and smx respectively the results indicated that the adsorption sites for the medium adsorbing omps were gradually occupied in 7 cycles when no regeneration was applied whereas after ozone based regeneration the adsorption capacity was fully recovered the rq of the low adsorbing omps without regeneration in 7 cycles was lower than 0 2 fig 9 by comparison the rq of cbz was almost constant at 0 6 after regeneration in 7 cycles fig 9a the rq of dic decreased from 0 61 to 0 29 in 7 cycles fig 9b the adsorption capacities of fresh granules were 1 9 and 1 07 μg g for cbz and dic respectively a hypothesis was that the accumulation of ozonation transformation products in the granules resulted in the decrease of rq the results indicated that the adsorption capacity of the low adsorbing omps was partially restored after ozone based regeneration thus it suggests that 60 min of ozonation is not long enough to recover the adsorption capacity along with the increase of the adsorption regeneration cycles 4 conclusions and outlook granular zeolites containing three types can effectively remove a broad range of omps from demi water by adsorption regeneration of dried zeolite granules loaded with omps by gaseous ozone is efficient adsorption by granular zeolites followed by regeneration with ozone in the gas phase offers possibilities to apply this process in practice specific transformation products generated in the ozonation of some selected omps might compete with the low adsorbing omps for adsorption sites thus their adsorption capacities dramatically decreased in a short ozonation duration along with the increase of the ozonation duration their adsorption capacities can be recovered 60 min of ozonation was long enough to fully recover the adsorption capacity of the majority of omps the adsorption capacity of six out of eight selected omps was completely restored in 7 cycles the accumulation of transformation products might only influence the adsorption capacity of diclofenac in 7 cycles

13306,advanced technologies to remove organic micropollutants omps from municipal wastewater have gained much attention over the last decades adsorption by zeolites is one of these technologies in this study the regeneration performance of well tailored granular zeolites loaded with omps was evaluated the selected omps were categorized into three groups due to the adsorption performance high medium and low adsorbance gaseous ozone was directly applied to regenerate dried zeolite granules at an ozone concentration of 30 mg l and a gas flow rate of 0 2 l min 0 04 m s for the high and medium adsorbing omps 45 min of ozonation was long enough to fully restore their adsorption capacity for the low adsorbing omps the regeneration efficiency reached 60 after 60 min of ozonation interestingly their recovered adsorption capacities firstly decreased and subsequently increased along with the ozonation duration the dramatically decrease was most probably due to the presence of the transformation products generated from the ozonation of some selected omps in seven sequential adsorption regeneration cycles the adsorption capacity for 75 of the selected omps was fully recovered at an ozonation duration of 60 min in each regeneration the assumed accumulation of the ozonation transformation products only influenced the adsorption of low adsorbing omps in 7 cycles graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords adsorption granular zeolites organic micropollutants ozone based regeneration transformation products 1 introduction the presence of organic micropollutants omps in the aquatic environment has become an increasing problem for the quality of aquatic ecosystems and for the production of drinking water from surface water in the last decades omps comprise pharmaceuticals plant protection products personal care products and industrial chemicals many enter the aquatic environment via municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps 1 omps occur in water bodies at trace levels between few ng l and several μg l the low concentration both increases the difficulties of detection and analysis and also brings challenges for wastewater treatment 2 municipal wwtps are designed to control a wide range of substances including particulates carbonaceous substances nutrients and pathogens these substances can be efficiently and consistently eliminated 2 however traditional wwtps are not specifically designed for the removal of omps 3 and the average removal efficiency ranges from 30 to 65 4 thus many of the omps pass through the wastewater treatment processes the occurrence of omps and their fate and removal from wastewater were reviewed in many studies in the last decades 1 9 omps are becoming a severe threat to the aquatic life as it is associated with many negative effects such as short term and long term toxicity endocrine disrupting effects and antibiotic resistance of microorganisms 10 for this reason the dutch ministry of infrastructure and water management lists 11 compounds as target substances to monitor the effectiveness of novel treatment technologies for removal of omps from wastewater 11 adsorption is an effective technology to remove omps activated carbons are widely used as adsorbents to treat municipal wastewater 12 13 currently ozonation followed by granular activated carbon filtration is applied to remove pharmaceuticals from municipal treatment effluents 12 after the adsorbent is exhausted it has to be regenerated or replaced to regain the adsorption capacity thermal reactivation is commonly used to regenerate exhausted activated carbons 14 as an alternative oxidative technologies especially ozonation are promisingly able to regenerate the exhausted adsorbents 15 however ozone can attack and destroy the structure of activated carbons 16 thus ozonation is not suitable for regeneration of activated carbons recently hydrophobic zeolites were evaluated as alternative adsorbents their structure with uniform small pores a few å makes them attractive for selective uptake of omps from the wastewater containing natural organic matters nom 17 18 moreover ozonation can effectively regenerate zeolites after adsorption of omps without changing their structure properties 19 however a limited number of studies are available and they all focus on the regeneration of powdered zeolites by ozone in the water phase zsm 5 zeolite with high ratio of si al was capable to highly concentrate the ozone dissolved in water 20 this property was able to promote the removal of

of the elution was set at 0 35 ml min with 95 ultrapure water acidified with 0 1 formic acid and 5 acetonitrile the oven temperature was 40 c ms provides a specific and sensitive detection of multiple omps the compounds are ionized first and separated based on their mass to charge ratios m z the mass spectrum at each retention time point provides the molecular mass and structural information an internal standard is for each omp was added in equal amount to both the calibration standards 0 0025 10 μg l and unknown samples by adding an is for quantitation the variations of the measurement can be corrected and then the accuracy of the results is improved 30 limits of detection lod and quantitation loq and the retention time for each compound are listed in table 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of loading duration the decrease of the concentrations of eight selected omps as a function of time is shown in fig 2 the eight omps were categorized into three groups by their removal efficiencies after 288 h adsorption sot mp and tmp were the high adsorbing omps their removal efficiencies were above 99 bt mebt and smx were the medium adsorbing omps for bt and smx their removal efficiencies were around 70 for mebt its removal efficiency was 88 the adsorption isotherms of the medium adsorbing omps were interpreted with the freundlich model fig s1 supplementary information cbz and dic were the low adsorbing omps their removal efficiencies were around 20 for the high adsorbing omps their concentrations decreased from around 4 μg l to 0 μg l after 120 h they were adsorbed faster than the other two categories for the medium adsorbing omps the adsorption equilibrium was reached after 250 h the concentration of mebt at the start was around 8 μg l as the same amounts of 4 mebt and 5 mebt were spiked in the solution the lc ms recognized them as the same compound the low adsorbing omps were slightly removed the concentration of cbz decreased from 4 μg l to 3 μg l after 120 h while the concentration of dic decreased from 4 μg l to 3 2 μg l after 240 h it indicated that all the high adsorbing omps were completely removed after 120 h adsorption the concentrations of the medium adsorbing omps still decreased slowly after 120 h while the concentrations of the low adsorbing omps remained constant the results suggest that the loading duration applied in the adsorption tests for the indication of regeneration performance is considered appropriate around 120 h if the loading duration was shorter than 120 h 50 h for instance the uptake of omps was still in the rapid adsorption zone the relative adsorption capacity for the high and medium adsorbing omps would be estimated high as there were many remaining available adsorption sites if the loading duration was longer than 120 h 200 h for instance the relative adsorption capacity for the target omps would be most likely close to 1 because the same loading of omps could be reached in a long adsorption duration with a slower adsorption rate in the second loading process after regeneration in both cases the regeneration performance could not be well determined 3 2 optimum ozone based regeneration duration the regeneration performance of zeolite granules loaded with omps at different ozonation durations is shown in figs 3 5 it is worth mentioning that gaseous ozone did not affect the adsorption capacity of omps on zeolite table s1 supplementary information the same results were also found in our previous study 27 for the high adsorbing omps their relative adsorption capacities rq remained 1 after all ozonation durations fig 3 it indicated that there were many adsorption sites available on zeolites for the high adsorbing omps therefore when no regeneration was applied the rq could also reach 1 the rq of the medium adsorbing omps gradually increased along with the ozonation duration fig 4 the rq of bt and mebt increased from 0 64 at 0 min ozonation to 1 at 45 min ozonation while the rq of smx increased from 0 84 at 0 min ozonation to 1 at 30 min ozonation the results indicated that 45 min of ozonation was long enough for the zeolite granules to restore the adsorption capacity of the high and medium adsorbing omps for the low adsorbing omps the rq reached around 0 6 at 60 min ozonation fig 5 a interestingly the rq of cbz reached 0 56 at 5 min ozonation and dramatically decreased from 0 56 to 0 24 at 20 min ozonation subsequently the rq increased to 0 59 at 60 min ozonation a similar pattern was found for dic the rq of dic reached 0 63 at 5 min ozonation decreased to 0 31 at 30 min ozonation and eventually reached 0 63 at 60 min ozonation to further study the influence of the ozonation duration the regeneration performance of the adsorption of only cbz instead of a mixture of omps is shown in fig 5b the rq of cbz increased from 0 15 to 0 7 at 10 min ozonation and remained around 0 53 at 20 min ozonation the assumption for the tendency of cbz in fig 5b was that at a short ozonation duration 10 min the adsorption sites on zeolites for cbz were released but not completely this was due to the rapid reaction of ozone and the double bond in cbz 31 meanwhile many transformation products containing quinazoline groups were generated during the ozonation of cbz 32 the ozonation transformation products of cbz adsorbed on zeolites and or the not long enough ozonation duration may result in a low rq around 0 5 after 60 min ozonation 3 3 influence of ozonation transformation products furthermore it can be hypothesized that the decrease of rq from 5 min to 20 min fig 5a was caused by the adsorption of transformation products generated in the ozonation of all eight omps which competed with cbz for adsorption sites subsequently the rq increased along with the decomposition of the ozonation transformation products at longer ozonation durations the results suggest that a longer ozonation duration of at least 60 min is needed for the granules to restore the adsorption capacity of the low adsorbing omps in addition the total ion chromatogram fig s2 supplementary information was acquired over a mass range of m z 50 400 in positive ion mode for the liquid samples after methanol extraction the peak curves in fig s2 were processed by subtracting the total ion chromatogram of fresh zeolite granules after comparing all the peaks of the curves after different ozonation durations the most interesting aspect of the data was at the retention time of 3 35 min along with the increase of the ozonation duration the intensity of the peak at 3 35 min started to increase after 5 min ozonation and reached the highest level at 20 min ozonation after 20 min ozonation the peak intensity decreased until 45 min ozonation this trend was reversely corresponding to the rq changes of cbz fig 5a the mass spectrums at the retention time of 3 35 min are shown in fig s3 supplementary information three ozonation transformation products were selected from the peaks their abbreviations were p213 p218 and p274 respectively the numbers refer to their m z obtained from the esi ms analysis the intensity of the three products after different ozonation durations are shown in fig 6 at 20 min ozonation the intensity of all the three products reached the highest level for p274 its intensity increased after 5 min ozonation and decreased after 20 min ozonation it is possible to hypothesize that the formation of p213 p218 and p274 might influence the adsorption capacity of cbz after different ozonation durations fig 5a moreover p274 might contain m273 c13h24no5 which was identified as an oxidation product formed in the ozonation of metoprolol 33 34 p274 might also contain dic p 273 9813 16 4 which was identified as a transformation product of diclofenac 35 it is worth mentioning that metoprolol is one of the high adsorbing omps and diclofenac is the other low adsorbing omp identifications of p213 and p218 were not found in the literature thus it can be further hypothesized that the ozonation transformation products formed in the reaction of ozone with the omps other than cbz might influence the adsorption capacity of cbz after different ozonation durations fig 5a 3 4 long term adsorption regeneration performance the regeneration performance of the high adsorbing omps in seven adsorption regeneration cycles is shown in fig 7 the rq was constant at 1 after 60 min of ozonation in seven cycles and the rq without regeneration was also approaching 1 in each cycle the difference of the rq between regeneration and without regeneration was smaller than 0 05 for each cycle the average adsorption capacities were 6 31 5 99 and 7 07 μg g for sot mp and tmp respectively the results indicated that huge amounts of adsorption sites for the high adsorbing omps were present in the zeolites therefore the rq can reach 1 after 7 cycles even without regeneration for the medium adsorbing omps the rq with regeneration remained at 1 in 7 cycles while the rq without regeneration gradually decreased in 7 cycles fig 8 after 7 cycles without regeneration the rq of bt decreased from 0 66 to 0 44 fig 8a the rq of mebt decreased from 0 61 to 0 5 fig 8b and the rq of smx decreased from 0 83 to 0 62 fig 8c the adsorption capacities of fresh granules were 4 85 6 5 and 4 01 μg g for bt mebt and smx respectively the results indicated that the adsorption sites for the medium adsorbing omps were gradually occupied in 7 cycles when no regeneration was applied whereas after ozone based regeneration the adsorption capacity was fully recovered the rq of the low adsorbing omps without regeneration in 7 cycles was lower than 0 2 fig 9 by comparison the rq of cbz was almost constant at 0 6 after regeneration in 7 cycles fig 9a the rq of dic decreased from 0 61 to 0 29 in 7 cycles fig 9b the adsorption capacities of fresh granules were 1 9 and 1 07 μg g for cbz and dic respectively a hypothesis was that the accumulation of ozonation transformation products in the granules resulted in the decrease of rq the results indicated that the adsorption capacity of the low adsorbing omps was partially restored after ozone based regeneration thus it suggests that 60 min of ozonation is not long enough to recover the adsorption capacity along with the increase of the adsorption regeneration cycles 4 conclusions and outlook granular zeolites containing three types can effectively remove a broad range of omps from demi water by adsorption regeneration of dried zeolite granules loaded with omps by gaseous ozone is efficient adsorption by granular zeolites followed by regeneration with ozone in the gas phase offers possibilities to apply this process in practice specific transformation products generated in the ozonation of some selected omps might compete with the low adsorbing omps for adsorption sites thus their adsorption capacities dramatically decreased in a short ozonation duration along with the increase of the ozonation duration their adsorption capacities can be recovered 60 min of ozonation was long enough to fully recover the adsorption capacity of the majority of omps the adsorption capacity of six out of eight selected omps was completely restored in 7 cycles the accumulation of transformation products might only influence the adsorption capacity of diclofenac in 7 cycles

13307,water treatment plants applied large amount of chlorine to eliminate microorganisms and prevent future microbial contamination of drinking water electrophilic substitution and electron transfer activities between natural organic matter nom and free chlorine resulted in the formation of chlorinated disinfection byproducts dbps chlorinated dbps consumption and exposure provoked severe health risks susceptible to cause death and or lifetime illness conventional water treatment approaches such as membrane filtration adsorption sedimentation and coagulation are much appropriated to eliminate chlorinated dbps precursors with a percentage removal estimated at 70 at the lowest concentration of chlorinated dbps conventional water treatment approaches fail to eliminate chlorinated dbps in drinking water in this review we discussed catalytic hydrodehalogenation as an efficient approach to advance a complete eradication of chlorinated dbps in drinking water metal nanocatalysts contributions were reviewed to understand the chemical pathways throughout the catalytic hydrodehalogenation of chlorinated dbps palladium received much attention as metal nanocatalysts to facilitate the catalytic hydrodehalogenation of chlorinated dbps catalytic investigations through novel nanocatalysts exploration should be intensified to gain insights in catalytic hydrodehalogenation of chlorinated dbps and advance its possible incorporation in water treatment technology graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords halogenated disinfection byproducts hydrogen sources metal nanocatalysts hydrodehalogenation water chlorination water treatment process 1 introduction water treatment technology concentrates much energy to protect and prevent the depletion of natural potable water water scarcity faced by humanity constitutes a major concern because of the negative impact on the ecosystem and human lives about 80 of planet earth is covered by surface water and groundwater such as rivers sea lake and ocean surface water and groundwater contain chemical and biological substances such as heavy metals organic compounds and microorganisms which prohibited its direct consumption water treatment process combined series of physicochemical techniques to improve the quality of surface water before its consumption surface water and groundwater pollutants are diverse and varied with climate geographic location and socio economic activities 1 3 in nowadays socio economic activities such as mining manufacturing and agriculture are prevalent causes of surface water contamination 4 7 strong regulations must be implemented to regulate the socio economic activities to protect surface water conventional water treatment approaches such as coagulation membrane filtration adsorption and sedimentation are systematically performed to remove chemical pollutants in surface water organic pollutants known as natural organic matter nom are frequently tackled during water treatment process due to their diversity and toxicity capable to cause severe clinic threats to the water consumers nom consists of a heterogeneous mixture of organic compounds originated from decayed plants and animals and chemicals dissolved in surface water nom can be partitioned into three fractions hydrophobic humic hydrophilic non humic and transphobic 8 hydrophobic fraction composed of fulvic and humic acids constituted the largest fraction about 75 of total nom in surface water novel techniques have been advanced to facilitate the splitting of nom such as the modified polarity assessment method mpram reported by nkambule et al which allowed nom to split into fractions under middle conditions 9 conventional water treatment approaches led to about 70 removal of nom in surface water 10 12 studies are going on to elucidate nom complexity and genesis which constitute the fundamental steps to its complete removal in surface water microorganisms such as bacteria archaea fungi protozoa algae and viruses in drinking water present severe health risks susceptible to lead to lifetime illness and cancers 13 14 water disinfection is basically performed at the last stage of water treatment process to eliminate pathogen substances in drinking water before the discharge in delivery networks several water disinfection methods were advanced to annihilate infectious microorganisms in drinking water namely ultraviolet disinfection 15 16 ozone disinfection 17 18 chlorine disinfection 19 20 silver for water disinfection 21 22 and photocatalytic disinfection 23 24 chlorine disinfection method gained much attention compared to the others owing to its efficacy affordability and accessibility it is critical to mention that most of water treatment plants applied water chlorination as a disinfection method chlorine is applied in excess for an effective water disinfection and to prevent future reinfection of disinfected water excess chlorine defined as free chlorine assured the consumption of microbe free water chemical reactions between free chlorine and nom formed chlorinated disinfection byproducts dbps 25 26 typically free halogen interacted with nom to form halogenated dbps such as chlorinated dbps brominated dbps and iodinated dbps halogenated dbps in drinking water are responsible for severe illness as well as cancers 27 28 among the closely monitored halogenated dbps by water treatment technology we can list trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas haloacetonitriles hans chlorophenols and chlorate the world health organization who imposed permissible concentration guidelines to minimize the consumption or exposure of halogenated dbps in drinking water the total thms comprising chcl3 chbrcl2 chbr2cl and chbr3 in drinking water should not exceed 100 μg l 29 the united states scale the permissible total thms in drinking water at 80 μg l whereas canada and australia provide a guideline values of 100 μg l and 250 μg l of the total thms respectively 30 32 the haas are also regulated in different countries namely us with 60 μg l permissible concentration and 80 μg l guideline value in canada diverse unregulated halogenated dbps have been reported in water drinking distribution networks such as dichloroacetonitrile trichloropropanone and trichloronitromethane 33 this indicated that more than to regulate halogenated dbps permissible concentration works should be conducted to achieve the complete eradication of halogenated dbps in drinking water dehalogenation process defined as carbon halogen bonds cleavage constitutes the reliable chemical approach to promote for a complete removal of halogenated dbps in drinking water radical and electronic cleavages are the evoked mechanism pathways to describe the carbon halogen bonds cleavage during dehalogenation 34 35 dehalogenation always coupled with another chemical reaction such as hydrogenation where the cleaved carbon linked with hydrogen reductive dehalogenation and suzuki cross coupling where carbon carbon bonds were formed 34 36 mechanistic models such as dissociative electron attachment dea desorption induced by electronic transition diet and desorption induced by multiple electronic transition dimet were developed to describe the electronic transfer process throughout dehalogenation of organic halide compounds 37 39 duta et al applied a hot electron transfer based on dea model to elucidate the kinetic and mechanism behind the dehalogenation of brominated purine 40 yang et al reported an efficient electrochemical dehalogenation of florfenicol based on electrochromic wo3 41 the electrocatalytic dehalogenation of ccl and cf bonds in florfenicol was estimated at 99 7 for 120 min reaction time the incorporation of nanomaterials in water treatment processes highly improved the physicochemical techniques applied to produce safe and clean water drinking 42 44 metal nanoparticles were broadly applied as nanocatalysts to facilitate the complete removal of halogenated dbps following the reductive dehalogenation process under eco friendly conditions it is critical to underline that the absence of catalysts resulted in zero reductive dehalogenation activity reductive dehalogenation conducted in aqua phase can be referred as hydrodehalogenation metal nanoparticles fast agglomeration rate constituted a huge drawback for a suitable catalytic transformation several synthetic methods were advanced to produce robust metal nanocatalysts and evaluated their catalytic activities in hydrodehalogenation of halogenated dbps 45 47 in this work we reviewed scientific publications related to the hydrodehalogenation of halogenated dbps catalyzed by transition metal nanocatalysts and their potential applications in water treatment technology catalytic pathways were evoked to detail the interfacial interaction between halogenated dbps and metal nanoparticles during catalytic hydrodehalogenation 2 halogenated dbps formation optical analytic methods were explored to descript nom contents as well as to monitor nom removal throughout water treatment process fluorescence excitation emission matrix spectroscopy with parallel factor feem parafac analysis was recently developed and applied in south africa to monitor nom removals through coagulation 48 49 the feem parafac analysis revealed that about 42 of the dissolved organic compounds were removed through coagulation as aforementioned about 70 of nom can be removed through water treatment process the optical analysis results indicated that a higher percentage of nom aromatic fraction is removed compared to nom aliphatic fraction during water treatment process 50 51 this indicated that nom aliphatic fraction constitutes the principal organic precursors interacting with free halogen to form halogenated dbps gaseous chlorine and or hypochlorite compounds are the most preferable chlorine sources for water chlorination to eliminate microorganisms in drinking water 52 a two dimension quantitative plot defined as a chlorination plot can be constructed to monitor water chlorination 53 two variables chlorine residual versus chlorine constructed a chlorination plot and led to a chlorination curve fig 1 a illustrates a chlorination curve progression during water chlorination infectious substances extermination is achieved at breakpoint or dip it is recommended to slightly exceed the breakpoint more chlorine addition during water chlorination to prevent the recontamination of disinfected water march and gual constructed a chlorination curve to monitor the chlorination of raw greywater with hypochlorite 54 the chlorination curve indicated the typical hump and dip profile which assessed the formation and destruction of chloramine at 1 5 mol of hypochlorite that indicated more than 1 5 mol of hypochlorite was required to effectively decontaminate raw greywater and prevent its recontamination fig 1b showed a chlorinate curve constructed throughout raw greywater chlorination with hypochlorite for an hour of contact time excess chlorine interacted with nom to generate chlorinated dbps 55 two mechanisms have been advanced to explain the chemical pathway of chlorinated dbps formation first chlorine fast hydrolysis produced hypochlorous acid hclo and hypochlorite ions clo 56 hypochlorous acid and hypochlorite ions interacted with nom through electrophilic substitution and or electron transfer mechanisms to form chlorinated dbps 57 60 a similar chemical pathway is invoked to describe the formation of halogenated dbps bromine hydrolysis produced hypobromous acid hypobromite ions hbro bro which reacted with nom to form brominated dbps 59 different free halogens led to a competitive halogenation for the formation of halogenated dbps 59 61 the formation of brominated dbps proceeded much faster than chlorinated dbps ones the formation of halogenated dbps has been reported during water treatment process water treatment process conducted membrane based treatment to eliminate organic pollutants in surface water however particles fouled faced by membrane based treatment significantly reduced the fluidity of refresh water physical and chemical cleaning methods were developed to recycle the fouled membrane 62 63 chemical cleaning methods commonly applied chemical agents such as nh4oh h2so4 peroxidase and naclo to reclaim membrane fluidity 62 64 long recycling time and high concentration of sodium hypochlorite throughout the reclaim of a fouled membrane was reported to generate chlorinated dbps 65 ye et al indicated that the presence of chlorine dioxide led to the formation of iodinated dbps during oxidation of iodide containing waters 66 the use of chlorinated or halogenated compounds to reclaim the fluidity of a fouled membrane should be prohibited to prevent the risk of halogenated dbps formation peroxymonosulfate oxidation is one of the degradation processes widely conducted to mineralize organic pollutants in wastewater 67 68 xie et al reported the formation of brominated dbps during peroxymonosulfate oxidation due to free bromine presence 69 chu et al demonstrated that water temperature influenced the formation of iodinated haloacetamides during persulfate oxidation 70 this demonstrated that sulfate based oxidation technologies in water treatment process should be applied with precautions fakour and lo lately reported the formation of chlorinated dbps in herbal spa pools 71 hydrolytic dissolution of herbal medicine releases organic substances which interact with free halogen and form halogenated dbps an extended conservation period of herbal spas in tape water can result in the formation of halogenated dbps porcar santos et al reported the formation of halogenated dbps in stimulated seawater during photocatalytic degradation of sulfamethoxazole catalyzed by tio2 nanoparticles 72 this indicated that the photodegradation of organic pollutants in the presence of free halogen may generate halogenated dbps analytical and physicochemical techniques were widely reimaged to facilitate the quantification and identification of halogenated dbps in drinking water tao et al recently developed an analytic stepwise technique to detect halogenated dbps in tap water using a liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry lphc q orbitrap ms 73 the analytic stepwise technique unveiled the presence of the unknown halogenated dbps 123 x dbps in tap water saturated aliphatic and phenolic halogenated dbps were equally identified through lphc q orbitrap ms analysis using uplc esi tqms analysis gong et al showed that the chlorination of saline wastewater effluents can result in the formation of unknown iodinated dbps 74 shahar et al constructed an enzymatic reflectance biosensor to detect halogenated dbps 75 the enzymatic halocarbon reflectance biosensor permitted 1 2 dichloromethane 50 mg l 1 detection at 662 nm the storage period of the enzymatic reflectance biosensor was estimated at up to 6 days at ph 8 0 and 4 c table 1 lists recent analytic methods applied to detect halogenated dbps the detection and quantification of halogenated dbps constituted the fundamental steps to achieve their effective removal for a safe drinking water production epidemiology studies unveiled that the exposure and consumption of halogenated dbps can provoke multiple types of cancer such as colon rectum stomach brain pancreas lung urinary bladder and liver 81 82 halogenated dbps toxicity pertained to halogen and can be classified as that iodinated dbps brominated dbps chlorinated dbps 74 83 epidemiology reports indicated that human beings are confronted with adverse reproductivity due to exposure or consumption of halogenated dbps 52 mammals epidemiology trials unveiled an effective link between thms and some biological toxicities such as neurotoxicity reproductive toxicity hepatoxicity and nephrotoxicity 84 the skin exposure on halogenated dbps was found responsible for melanoma cancer 85 87 clinic risks associated with consumption and exposure of halogenated dpbs are countless scientific researchers and governments must join efforts to develop and implement sustainable strategies for the elimination of halogenated dbps in drinking water 3 catalytic dehalogenation biological and chemical approaches were explored to address catalytic dehalogenation of halogenated organic compounds microbial hydrodehalogenation consisted of enzymatic dehalogenation where dehalogenase promoted carbon halogen bonds cleavage oyewusi et al reviewed the potential role of dehalogenase producing halophilic bacteria in decontamination of marine environmental 88 microbial and chemical dehalogenation can be combined to advance the cleavage of carbon halogen bonds synergistic effect generated by dehalogenase bacteria and iron nanoparticles was found to enhance the microbial anaerobic dechlorination of perchloroethene 89 the use of microbial dehalogenase to eliminate halogenated dbps could not be acceptable for the production of safe and clean drinking water therefore chemical approach using metal nanocatalysts to advance catalytic dehalogenation constitutes the viable technology to achieve safe and complete removal of halogenated dbps water chlorination is commonly conducted at the last stage of water treatment process before the discharging of drinking water for consumption conventional water treatment approaches served to eliminate the organic precursors nom of halogenated dbps and pre formed halogenated dbps in surface water 90 92 at the lowest concentration of halogenated dbps conventional water treatment approaches failed to remove the halogenated dbps 93 this shows the necessity of alternative removal approaches for an effectively elimination of halogenated dbps in drinking water and subsequently cut off clinic risks associated with its consumption catalytic dehalogenation emerged as an efficient approach for the removal of halogenated dbps in drinking water 94 95 metal nanoparticles were often applied as nanocatalysts to improve the catalytic dehalogenation of halogenated dbps in this review attention is given to understand the chemical activity generated by the mutual interaction between nanocatalysts and halogenated dbps during catalytic dehalogenation catalytic dehalogenation consisted of low cost and eco friendly chemical transformations proceeded at middle conditions in the absence of catalysts dehalogenation of halogenated dbps can t be achieved due to the remarkable energy bond describing carbon halogen bonds 96 shen et al conducted a redox mediated electro fenton process for the complete dechlorination and mineralization of chlorophenol catalyzed by an in situ formed pdfe nanoalloy catalyst 97 reductive sites on the surface of pdfe improved hydrogen adsorption and oxygen molecular reduction oxygen species such as hydroxide radicals were found responsible for the complete mineralization of chlorophenol oxygen species oxygen radicals and sulfate radicals were reported to favor the formation of halogenated dbps 69 the uncontrollable state of oxidative dehalogenation pathways provoked the formation of halogenated dbps this supported the lack of interest in oxidative dehalogenation to eliminate halogenated dbps in drinking water reductive dehalogenation has been explored as an alternative removal approach for a sustainable elimination of halogenated dbps to improve the quality of drinking water reductive dehalogenation of halogenated dbps can be detailed as such the carbon halogen bond cleaved to release halogen and hydrogen species substituted the released halogen to form a carbon hydrogen bond reductive dehalogenation has been numerously conducted in synthetic chemistry and chemical engineering transformations 98 99 scheme 1 illustrates reductive dehalogenation of halogenated dbps catalyzed by metal nanocatalyst reductive dehalogenation consisted of selective and effective approaches to eliminate halogenated dbps in drinking water a large discussion on reductive dehalogenation or hydrodehalogenation for the removal of halogenated dbps will be articulated in the following paragraphs 4 reductive catalytic dehalogenation heterogeneous nanocatalysts are usually constructed with solid supports to accommodate activity metal nanoparticles mesoporous transition metal oxide materials were majorly solicited as solid supports owing to their porosity and thermal stability recent scientific reports indicated that mesoporous transition metal oxide materials expanded their interests in heterogeneous nanocatalysis as solid supports to active nanocatalysts 100 101 mesoporous transition metal oxide materials as catalysts were not much explored for the hydrodehalogenation of halogenated dbps recently patra et al designed a highly ordered mesoporous metal oxide materials mft 1 composed of tio2 fe2o3 using sodium dodecyl sulfate as a structured directing agent 102 the mft 1 showed great catalytic activity during the reductive dehalogenation of diverse halogenated compounds our literature searches revealed that so far only mft 1 has been tested as a catalyst for the reductive dehalogenation of halogenated compounds experiments are needed to gain much insights about mesoporous transition metal oxide materials as heterogeneous catalysts in reductive dehalogenation of halogenated dbps a successful ending will certainly lead to low cost and efficient removal of halogenated dbps which will highly enhance the quality of drinking water metal nanoparticles supported on solid supports have been explored as nanocatalysts in countless chemical transformations the interfacial interaction between metal nanoparticles and solid supports was found to generate physical effects such as charge transfer synergist and spill over 103 105 those physical effects were of great interest for the improvement of catalytic activity and chemical transformations zheng et al reported a synergistic effect from palladium nanoparticles metal oxide supports catalysts during hydrodehalogenation of bromochloroacetic acid 106 a precipitation method was followed for the synthesis of transition metal oxide supports ceo2 al2o3 activated carbon ac and sio2 a precipitation deposition approach was performed to depose pd nanoparticles onto the transition metal oxide supports pd sio2 indicated a negligible reaction rate progression compared to the rest of the supported nanocatalysts pd ceo2 led to the complete mineralization of bromochloroacetic acid where hydrodehalogenation was observed for pd al2o3 and pd ac several hypotheses can be invoked to interpret bromochloroacetic acid mineralization in the presence of pd ceo2 high adhesion energy on the surface of ceo2 facilitated hydrogen spilling over on pd nanocatalyst and lattice oxygen mobility on ceo2 are the reliable catalytic pathway responsible for the complete mineralization of bromochloroacetic acid in the presence of pd ceo2 107 108 the kinetic models such as the langmuir hinshelwood kinetic model have been often solicited to confirm the interfacial interaction between halogenated dbps and metal nanocatalyst throughout reductive dehalogenation 97 109 for a fast reductive dehalogenation process halogenated dbps sorption onto metal nanocatalyst surface constituted the rate determining step most of the kinetic data generated from reductive dehalogenation of halogenated dbps fit with the langmuir hinshelwood kinetic model 109 111 this indicated that the reaction rates during reductive dehalogenation of halogenated dbps depended on the interfacial interaction between the catalyst and substrates fig 2 shows the langmuir hinshelwood kinetic model fit of bromochloroacetic acid hydrodehalogenation catalyzed by pd nanocatalyst deposited on ceria 106 halogenated dbps concentration linearly progressed along with the reaction rate which showed that halogenated dbps adsorption on metal nanocatalyst surface governed the reaction rate of reductive dehalogenation wu et al conducted a hydrodehalogenation of 4 chlorophenol catalyzed by palladium phosphide nanoparticles pd3p0 95 sio2 using hydrogen gas as hydrogen sources 112 the langmuir hinshelwood kinetic model indicated that the adsorption of substrates on palladium phosphide nanoparticles surface consisted of the rate determining step enhancing the catalytic rate of 4 chlorophenol hydrodehalogenation phosphides played an essential role in adsorption control minimizing the adsorption of chlorine and sulfur ions on palladium surface while improving 4 chlorophenol adsorption the adsorption control enhanced the turnover rate of 4 chlorophenol hydrodehalogenation fig 3 a c pictures the turnover rate variation based on the adsorption of substrates 4 chlorophenol chlorine and sulfur on the surface of palladium phosphides nanocatalysts 112 the equilibrium constant established by 4 chlorophenol and palladium nanoparticles was higher than the ones from chlorine ions and palladium nanoparticles table 2 our literature search indicated that palladium nanoparticles have been largely explored as metal nanocatalysts to facilitate the reductive dehalogenation of halogenated dbps however no clear reports have been found to support a real application in water treatment plants nevertheless we highly believe that hydrodehalogenation constitutes an efficient scientific approach in the removal of halogenated dbps in drinking water cai et al lately reported hydrodechlorination of trichloroacetic acid assisted by palladium nanoparticles deposited on h2 transfer membranes 109 the reaction rate was governed by the adsorption of substrates on palladium surface as the rate determining step in the hydrodechlorination of trichloroacetic acid mechanism pathway of trichloroacetic acid hydrodechlorination is illustrated in scheme 2 where hydrogen species on palladium interface interacted with adsorbed chlorinated dbps to initiate the hydrodechlorination table 3 lists scientific publications wherein transition metal nanocatalysts were involved in the reductive dehalogenation of halogenated dbps a remarkable catalytic activity exhibited by palladium nanoparticles during reductive dehalogenation of halogenated dbps is unquestionable and leads to a fast reaction rate for a complete halogenated dbps removal wu et al conducted a deposition method to design a hydrogen based membrane palladium film reactor h2 mpfr 122 the hollow fiber membrane containing palladium nanoparticles was evaluated in continuous flow hydrodehalogenation of 2 4 dichlorophenol palladium film nanocatalyst indicated an exceptional efficiency estimated at 87 of chlorinated dbps reduction the modified hollow fiber membrane prevented the migration of organic substances to clean water palladium film nanoparticles improved the anti fouling ability of the modified membrane also led to a complete hydrodechlorination of chlorinated dbps scheme 3 schematised the catalytic pathway 2 4 dichlorophenol hydrodehalogenation using of palladium film nanocatalyst this investigation demonstrated that reductive dehalogenation can perfectly be incorporated in water treatment plants and highly improved the reduction of total halogenated dbps percentage in drinking water 4 1 hydrogen sources hydrogen sources are of great interest in reductive

for reductive dehalogenation of halogenated dbps offered diverse possibilities which allowed the control of reaction rate and product formation hydrogen gas and borohydride ions are the preferable hydrogen sources for a sustainable reductive dehalogenation of halogenated dbps this can be justified by their eco friendly descriptions which favored the production of clean drinking water two scientific reports distinctively analyzed the hydrodechlorination pathways of trichloroacetic acid using hydrogen gas and sodium borohydride as hydrogen sources 109 125 cai et al conducted a successful hydrodechlorination of trichloroacetic acid catalyzed by palladium nanocatalyst using hydrogen gas as a hydrogen source 109 dichloroacetic and monochloroacetic acids were identified as

chlorophenol hydrodehalogenation mechanism pathways based on direct and indirect hydrogenations on the surface of metal nanocatalysts cu fe bimetallic low catalytic activity went in contrary to the commune knowledge where cu metal bimetallic system often highly improved catalytic activity during hydrodehalogenation compared to the monometallic system 127 the contrary observation can be explained by the absence of external hydrogen sources such as sodium borohydride protic solvents mixture constructed with water and alcohol can serve as hydrogen sources throughout the reductive dehalogenation of halogenated dbps water methanol mixture as solvents has been well documented for synthetic and pollutants degradation purposes throughout the reductive dehalogenation of halogenated organic

huang et al designed cu nanoparticle and successfully evaluated that as a nanocatalyst to reduce dichloromethane in the presence of sodium borohydride 130 water methanol mixture as a reaction medium enhanced the dehalogenation rate of dichloromethane yoshio et al achieved an electroreductive dehalogenation of chloroform using various metal electrodes in acetonitrile water mixtures at high current density 131 in water treatment technology the aqua medium is preferable for the reductive dehalogenation of halogenated dbps although protic solvents mixture water alcohol improved the reaction rate of the hydrodehalogenation of halogenated dbps alcohol removal to reclaim potable water might be costing for water treatment plants 4 3 electroreductive dehalogenation the electrochemical system has

water water scarcity faced by humanity constitutes a major concern because of the negative impact on the ecosystem and human lives about 80 of planet earth is covered by surface water and groundwater such as rivers sea lake and ocean surface water and groundwater contain chemical and biological substances such as heavy metals organic compounds and microorganisms which prohibited its direct consumption water treatment process combined series of physicochemical techniques to improve the quality of surface water before its consumption surface water and groundwater pollutants are diverse and varied with climate geographic location and socio economic activities 1 3 in nowadays socio economic activities such as mining manufacturing and agriculture are prevalent causes of surface water contamination 4 7 strong regulations must be implemented to regulate the socio economic activities to protect surface water conventional water treatment approaches such as coagulation membrane filtration adsorption and sedimentation are systematically performed to remove chemical pollutants in surface water organic pollutants known as natural organic matter nom are frequently tackled during water treatment process due to their diversity and toxicity capable to cause severe clinic threats to the water consumers nom consists of a heterogeneous mixture of organic compounds originated from decayed plants and animals and chemicals dissolved in surface water nom can be partitioned into three fractions hydrophobic humic hydrophilic non humic and transphobic 8 hydrophobic fraction composed of fulvic and humic acids constituted the largest fraction about 75 of total nom in surface water novel techniques have been advanced to facilitate the splitting of nom such as the modified polarity

water 10 12 studies are going on to elucidate nom complexity and genesis which constitute the fundamental steps to its complete removal in surface water microorganisms such as bacteria archaea fungi protozoa algae and viruses in drinking water present severe health risks susceptible to lead to lifetime illness and cancers 13 14 water disinfection is basically performed at the last stage of water treatment process to eliminate pathogen substances in drinking water before the discharge in delivery networks several water disinfection methods were advanced to annihilate infectious microorganisms in drinking water namely ultraviolet disinfection 15 16 ozone disinfection 17 18 chlorine disinfection 19 20 silver for water disinfection 21 22 and photocatalytic disinfection 23 24 chlorine disinfection method gained much attention compared to the others owing to its efficacy affordability and accessibility it is critical to mention that most of water treatment plants applied water chlorination as a disinfection method chlorine is applied in excess for an effective water disinfection and to prevent future reinfection of disinfected water excess chlorine defined as free chlorine assured the consumption of microbe free water chemical reactions between free chlorine and nom formed chlorinated disinfection byproducts dbps 25 26 typically free halogen interacted with nom to form halogenated dbps such as chlorinated dbps brominated dbps and iodinated dbps halogenated dbps in drinking water are responsible for severe illness as well as cancers 27 28 among the closely monitored halogenated dbps by water treatment technology we can list trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas haloacetonitriles hans chlorophenols and chlorate the world health organization who imposed permissible concentration guidelines to minimize the consumption or exposure of halogenated dbps in drinking water the total thms comprising chcl3 chbrcl2 chbr2cl and chbr3 in drinking water should not exceed 100 μg l 29 the united states scale the permissible total thms in drinking water at 80 μg l whereas canada and australia provide a guideline values of 100 μg l and 250 μg l of the total thms respectively 30 32 the haas are also regulated in different countries namely us with 60 μg l permissible concentration and 80 μg l guideline value in canada diverse unregulated halogenated dbps have been reported in water drinking distribution networks such as dichloroacetonitrile trichloropropanone and trichloronitromethane 33 this indicated that more than to regulate halogenated dbps permissible concentration works should be conducted to achieve the complete eradication of halogenated dbps in drinking water dehalogenation process defined as carbon halogen bonds cleavage constitutes the reliable chemical approach to promote for a complete removal of halogenated dbps in drinking water radical and electronic cleavages are the evoked mechanism pathways to describe the carbon halogen bonds cleavage during dehalogenation 34 35 dehalogenation always coupled with another chemical reaction such as hydrogenation where the cleaved carbon linked with hydrogen reductive dehalogenation and suzuki cross coupling where carbon carbon bonds were formed 34 36 mechanistic models such as dissociative electron attachment dea desorption induced by electronic transition diet and desorption induced by multiple electronic transition dimet were developed to describe the electronic transfer process throughout dehalogenation of organic halide compounds 37 39 duta et al applied

water treatment processes highly improved the physicochemical techniques applied to produce safe and clean water drinking 42 44 metal nanoparticles were broadly applied as nanocatalysts to facilitate the complete removal of halogenated dbps following the reductive dehalogenation process under eco friendly conditions it is critical to underline that the absence of catalysts resulted in zero reductive dehalogenation activity reductive dehalogenation conducted in aqua phase can be referred as hydrodehalogenation metal nanoparticles fast agglomeration rate constituted a huge drawback for a suitable catalytic transformation several synthetic methods were advanced to produce robust metal nanocatalysts and evaluated their catalytic activities in hydrodehalogenation of halogenated dbps 45 47 in this work we reviewed scientific publications related to the hydrodehalogenation of halogenated dbps catalyzed by transition metal nanocatalysts and their potential applications in water

dissolved organic compounds were removed through coagulation as aforementioned about 70 of nom can be removed through water treatment process the optical analysis results indicated that a higher percentage of nom aromatic fraction is removed compared to nom aliphatic fraction during water treatment process 50 51 this indicated that nom aliphatic fraction constitutes the principal organic precursors interacting with free halogen to form halogenated dbps gaseous chlorine and or hypochlorite compounds are the most preferable chlorine sources for water chlorination to eliminate microorganisms in drinking water 52 a two dimension quantitative plot defined as a chlorination plot can be constructed to monitor water chlorination 53 two variables chlorine residual versus chlorine

breakpoint or dip it is recommended to slightly exceed the breakpoint more chlorine addition during water chlorination to prevent the recontamination of disinfected water march and gual constructed a chlorination curve to monitor the chlorination of raw greywater with hypochlorite 54 the chlorination curve indicated the typical hump and dip profile which assessed the formation and destruction of chloramine at 1 5 mol of hypochlorite that indicated more than 1 5 mol of hypochlorite was required to effectively decontaminate raw greywater and prevent its recontamination fig 1b showed a chlorinate curve constructed throughout raw greywater chlorination with hypochlorite for an hour of contact time excess chlorine interacted with nom to generate chlorinated dbps 55 two mechanisms have been advanced to explain the chemical pathway of chlorinated dbps formation first chlorine fast hydrolysis produced hypochlorous acid hclo and hypochlorite ions clo 56 hypochlorous acid and hypochlorite ions interacted with nom through electrophilic substitution and or electron transfer mechanisms to form chlorinated dbps 57 60 a similar chemical pathway is invoked to describe the formation of halogenated dbps bromine hydrolysis produced hypobromous acid hypobromite ions hbro bro which reacted with nom to form brominated dbps 59 different free halogens led to a competitive halogenation for the formation of halogenated dbps 59 61 the formation of brominated dbps proceeded much faster than chlorinated dbps ones the formation of halogenated dbps has been reported during water treatment process water treatment process conducted membrane based treatment to eliminate organic pollutants in surface water however particles fouled faced by membrane based treatment significantly reduced the fluidity of refresh water physical and chemical cleaning methods were developed to recycle the fouled membrane 62 63 chemical cleaning methods commonly applied chemical agents such as nh4oh h2so4 peroxidase and naclo to reclaim membrane fluidity 62 64 long recycling time and high concentration of sodium hypochlorite throughout the reclaim of a fouled membrane was reported to generate chlorinated dbps 65 ye et al indicated that the presence of chlorine dioxide led to the formation of iodinated dbps during oxidation of iodide containing waters 66 the use of chlorinated or halogenated compounds to reclaim the fluidity of a fouled membrane should be prohibited to prevent the risk of halogenated dbps formation peroxymonosulfate oxidation is one of the degradation processes widely conducted to mineralize organic pollutants in wastewater 67 68 xie et al reported the formation of brominated dbps during peroxymonosulfate oxidation due to free bromine presence 69 chu et al demonstrated that water temperature influenced the formation of iodinated haloacetamides during persulfate oxidation 70 this demonstrated that sulfate based oxidation technologies in water treatment process should be applied with precautions fakour and lo lately reported the formation of chlorinated dbps in herbal spa pools 71 hydrolytic dissolution of herbal medicine releases organic substances which interact with free halogen and form halogenated dbps an extended conservation period of herbal spas in tape water can result in the formation of halogenated dbps porcar santos et al reported the formation of halogenated dbps in stimulated seawater during photocatalytic degradation of sulfamethoxazole catalyzed by tio2 nanoparticles 72 this indicated that the photodegradation of organic pollutants in the presence of free halogen may generate halogenated dbps analytical and physicochemical techniques were widely reimaged to facilitate the quantification and identification of halogenated dbps in drinking water tao et al recently developed an analytic stepwise technique to detect halogenated dbps in tap water using a liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry lphc q orbitrap ms 73 the analytic stepwise technique unveiled the presence of the unknown halogenated dbps 123 x dbps in tap water saturated aliphatic and phenolic halogenated dbps were equally identified through lphc q orbitrap ms analysis using uplc esi tqms analysis gong et al showed that the chlorination of saline wastewater effluents can result in the formation of unknown iodinated dbps 74 shahar et al constructed an enzymatic reflectance biosensor to detect halogenated dbps 75 the enzymatic halocarbon reflectance biosensor permitted 1 2 dichloromethane 50 mg l 1 detection at 662 nm the storage period of the enzymatic reflectance biosensor was estimated at up to 6 days at ph 8 0 and 4 c table 1 lists recent analytic methods applied to detect halogenated dbps the detection and quantification of halogenated dbps constituted the fundamental steps to achieve their effective removal for a safe drinking water production epidemiology studies unveiled that the exposure and consumption of halogenated dbps can provoke multiple types of cancer such as colon rectum stomach brain pancreas lung urinary bladder and liver 81 82 halogenated dbps toxicity pertained to halogen and can be classified as that iodinated dbps brominated dbps chlorinated dbps 74 83 epidemiology reports indicated that human beings are confronted with adverse reproductivity due to exposure or consumption of halogenated dbps 52 mammals epidemiology trials unveiled an effective link between thms and some biological toxicities such as neurotoxicity reproductive toxicity hepatoxicity and nephrotoxicity 84 the skin exposure on halogenated dbps was found responsible for melanoma cancer 85 87 clinic risks associated with consumption and exposure of halogenated dpbs are countless scientific researchers and governments must join efforts to develop and implement sustainable strategies for the elimination of halogenated dbps in drinking water 3 catalytic dehalogenation biological and chemical approaches were explored to address catalytic dehalogenation of halogenated organic compounds microbial hydrodehalogenation consisted of enzymatic dehalogenation where dehalogenase promoted carbon halogen bonds cleavage oyewusi et al reviewed the potential role of dehalogenase producing halophilic bacteria in decontamination of marine environmental 88 microbial and chemical dehalogenation can be combined to advance the cleavage of carbon halogen bonds synergistic effect generated by dehalogenase bacteria and iron nanoparticles was found to enhance the microbial anaerobic dechlorination of perchloroethene 89 the use of microbial dehalogenase to eliminate halogenated dbps could not be acceptable for the production of safe and clean drinking water therefore chemical approach using metal nanocatalysts to advance catalytic dehalogenation constitutes the viable technology to achieve safe and complete removal of halogenated dbps water chlorination is commonly conducted at the last stage of water treatment process before the discharging of drinking water for consumption conventional water treatment approaches served to eliminate the organic precursors nom of halogenated dbps and pre formed halogenated dbps in surface water 90 92 at the lowest concentration of halogenated dbps conventional water treatment approaches failed to remove the halogenated dbps 93 this shows the necessity of alternative removal approaches for an effectively elimination of halogenated dbps in drinking water and subsequently cut off clinic risks associated with its consumption catalytic dehalogenation emerged as an efficient approach for the removal of halogenated dbps in drinking water 94 95 metal nanoparticles were often applied as nanocatalysts to improve the catalytic dehalogenation of halogenated dbps in this review attention is given to understand the chemical activity generated by the mutual interaction between nanocatalysts and halogenated dbps during catalytic dehalogenation catalytic dehalogenation consisted of low cost and eco friendly chemical transformations proceeded at middle conditions in the absence of catalysts dehalogenation of halogenated dbps can t be achieved due to the remarkable energy bond describing carbon halogen bonds 96 shen et al conducted a redox mediated electro fenton process for the complete dechlorination and mineralization of chlorophenol catalyzed by an in situ formed pdfe nanoalloy catalyst 97 reductive sites on the surface of pdfe improved hydrogen adsorption and oxygen molecular reduction oxygen species such as hydroxide radicals were found responsible for the complete mineralization of chlorophenol oxygen species oxygen radicals and sulfate radicals were reported to favor the formation of halogenated dbps 69 the uncontrollable state of oxidative dehalogenation pathways provoked the formation of halogenated dbps this supported the lack of interest in oxidative dehalogenation to eliminate halogenated dbps in drinking water reductive dehalogenation has been explored as an alternative removal approach for a sustainable elimination of halogenated dbps to improve the quality of drinking water reductive dehalogenation of halogenated dbps can be detailed as such the carbon halogen bond cleaved to release halogen and hydrogen species substituted the

reductive dehalogenation of halogenated dbps catalyzed by metal nanocatalyst reductive dehalogenation consisted of selective and effective approaches to eliminate halogenated dbps in drinking water a large discussion on reductive dehalogenation or hydrodehalogenation for the removal of halogenated dbps will be articulated in the following paragraphs 4 reductive catalytic dehalogenation heterogeneous nanocatalysts are usually constructed with solid supports to accommodate activity metal nanoparticles mesoporous transition metal oxide materials were majorly solicited as solid supports owing to their porosity and thermal stability recent scientific reports indicated that mesoporous transition metal oxide materials expanded their interests in heterogeneous nanocatalysis as solid supports to active nanocatalysts 100 101 mesoporous transition metal oxide materials as catalysts were not much explored for the hydrodehalogenation of halogenated dbps recently patra et al designed a highly ordered mesoporous metal oxide materials mft 1 composed of tio2 fe2o3 using sodium dodecyl sulfate as a structured directing agent 102 the mft 1 showed great catalytic activity during the reductive dehalogenation of diverse halogenated compounds our literature searches revealed that so far only mft 1 has been tested as a catalyst for the reductive dehalogenation of halogenated compounds experiments are needed to gain much insights about mesoporous transition metal oxide materials as heterogeneous catalysts in reductive dehalogenation of halogenated dbps a successful ending will certainly lead to low cost and efficient removal of halogenated dbps which will highly enhance the quality of drinking water metal nanoparticles supported on solid supports have been explored as nanocatalysts in countless chemical transformations the interfacial interaction between metal nanoparticles and solid supports was found to generate physical effects such as charge transfer synergist and spill over 103 105 those physical effects were of great interest for the improvement of catalytic activity and chemical transformations zheng et al reported a synergistic effect from palladium nanoparticles metal oxide supports catalysts during hydrodehalogenation of bromochloroacetic acid 106 a precipitation method was followed for the synthesis of transition metal oxide supports ceo2 al2o3 activated carbon ac and sio2 a precipitation deposition approach was performed to depose pd nanoparticles onto the transition metal oxide supports pd sio2 indicated a negligible reaction rate progression compared to the rest of the supported nanocatalysts pd ceo2 led to the complete mineralization of bromochloroacetic acid where hydrodehalogenation was observed for pd al2o3 and pd ac several hypotheses can be invoked to interpret bromochloroacetic acid mineralization in the presence of pd ceo2 high adhesion energy on the surface of ceo2 facilitated hydrogen spilling over on pd nanocatalyst and lattice oxygen mobility on ceo2 are the reliable catalytic pathway responsible for the complete mineralization of bromochloroacetic acid in the presence of pd ceo2 107 108 the kinetic models such as the langmuir hinshelwood kinetic model have been often solicited to confirm the interfacial interaction between halogenated dbps and metal nanocatalyst throughout reductive dehalogenation 97 109 for a fast reductive dehalogenation process halogenated dbps sorption onto metal nanocatalyst surface constituted the rate determining step most of the kinetic data generated from reductive dehalogenation of halogenated dbps fit with the langmuir hinshelwood kinetic model 109 111 this indicated that the reaction rates during reductive dehalogenation of halogenated dbps depended on the interfacial interaction between the catalyst and substrates fig 2 shows the langmuir hinshelwood kinetic model fit of bromochloroacetic acid hydrodehalogenation catalyzed by pd nanocatalyst deposited on ceria 106 halogenated dbps concentration linearly progressed along with the reaction rate which showed that halogenated dbps adsorption on metal nanocatalyst surface governed the reaction rate of reductive dehalogenation wu et al conducted a hydrodehalogenation of 4 chlorophenol catalyzed by palladium phosphide nanoparticles pd3p0 95 sio2 using hydrogen gas as hydrogen sources 112 the langmuir hinshelwood kinetic model indicated that the adsorption of substrates on palladium phosphide nanoparticles surface consisted of the rate determining step enhancing the catalytic rate of 4 chlorophenol hydrodehalogenation phosphides played an essential role in adsorption control minimizing the adsorption of chlorine and sulfur ions on palladium surface while improving 4 chlorophenol adsorption the adsorption control enhanced the turnover rate of 4 chlorophenol hydrodehalogenation fig 3 a c pictures the turnover rate variation based on the adsorption of substrates 4 chlorophenol chlorine and sulfur on the surface of palladium phosphides nanocatalysts 112 the equilibrium constant established by 4 chlorophenol and palladium nanoparticles was higher than the ones from chlorine ions and palladium nanoparticles table 2 our literature search indicated that palladium nanoparticles have been largely explored as metal nanocatalysts to facilitate the reductive dehalogenation of halogenated dbps however no clear reports have been found to support a real application in water treatment plants nevertheless we highly believe that hydrodehalogenation constitutes an efficient scientific approach in the removal of halogenated dbps in drinking water cai et al lately reported hydrodechlorination of trichloroacetic acid assisted by palladium nanoparticles deposited on h2 transfer membranes 109 the reaction rate was governed by the adsorption of substrates on palladium surface as the rate determining step in the hydrodechlorination of trichloroacetic acid mechanism pathway of trichloroacetic acid hydrodechlorination is illustrated in scheme 2 where hydrogen species on palladium interface interacted with adsorbed chlorinated dbps to initiate the hydrodechlorination table 3 lists scientific publications wherein transition metal nanocatalysts were involved in the reductive dehalogenation of halogenated dbps a remarkable catalytic activity exhibited by palladium nanoparticles during reductive dehalogenation of halogenated dbps is unquestionable and leads to a fast reaction rate for a complete halogenated dbps removal wu et al conducted a deposition method to design a hydrogen based membrane palladium film reactor h2 mpfr 122 the hollow fiber membrane containing palladium nanoparticles was evaluated in continuous flow hydrodehalogenation of 2 4 dichlorophenol palladium film nanocatalyst indicated an exceptional efficiency estimated at 87 of chlorinated dbps reduction the modified hollow fiber membrane prevented the migration of organic substances to clean water palladium film nanoparticles improved the anti fouling ability of the modified membrane also led to a complete hydrodechlorination of chlorinated dbps scheme 3 schematised the catalytic pathway 2 4 dichlorophenol hydrodehalogenation using of palladium film nanocatalyst this investigation demonstrated that reductive dehalogenation can perfectly be incorporated in water treatment plants and highly improved the reduction of total halogenated dbps percentage in drinking water 4 1 hydrogen sources hydrogen sources are of great interest in reductive dehalogenation and should demonstrate eco friendly properties and market accessibility transition metal nanocatalysts facilitated the cleavage of carbon halogen bond and hydrogen sources provided hydrogen species to substitute the cleaved halogen hydrogen gas has been broadly applied as hydrogen sources to advance the reductive dehalogenation of halogenated dbps lan et al applied hydrogen gas as a hydrogen source to achieve chlorophenol hydrodechlorination under ambient condition in the presence of deposited palladium nanocatalyst 123 carbon nanotubes aluminum oxide activated carbon and graphene were used as supports and conventional impregnation method was performed to deposit palladium nanocatalyst on each support all the deposited palladium nanocatalysts exhibited exceptional catalytic activity throughout chlorophenol hydrodechlorination pd nanocatalyst deposited on carbon nanotubes exhibited the highest catalytic activity compared to all the rest carbon nanotubes large porosity was the reason for catalytic activity increase by permitting the substrates and product free mobility throughout hydrodehalogenation reaction hydrogen gas as hydrogen sources allowed a clean hydrodehalogenation of halogenated dbps which is highly motivating for water treatment technology hydrogen gas inflammability demands rigorous safety management that might restrain its interest for reductive dehalogenation of halogenated dbps in water treatment technology alternative hydrogen sources with much stability eco friendly and market accessibility such as borohydride compounds have been explored for a prompt hydrodehalogenation of halogenated dbps adhikary et al reported the reductive dehalogenation of haloacetic acids tri di mono bromoacetic acids and tri bi and mono chloroacetic acids using sodium borohydride as a hydrogen source 124 using sol gel entrapped gold and silver nanocatalysts haloacetic acids were dehalogenated under reductive conditions the product compositions pertained to the additional rate of sodium borohydride a fast addition of sodium borohydride resulted in complete dehalogenation of halogenated dbps borohydride ions as hydrogen sources for reductive dehalogenation of halogenated dbps offered diverse possibilities which allowed the control of reaction rate and product formation hydrogen gas and borohydride ions are the preferable hydrogen sources for a sustainable reductive dehalogenation of halogenated dbps this can be justified by their eco friendly descriptions which favored the production of clean drinking water two scientific reports distinctively analyzed the hydrodechlorination pathways of trichloroacetic acid using hydrogen gas and sodium borohydride as hydrogen sources 109 125 cai et al conducted a successful hydrodechlorination of trichloroacetic acid catalyzed by palladium nanocatalyst using hydrogen gas as a hydrogen source 109 dichloroacetic and monochloroacetic acids were identified as intermediaries before obtaining acetic acid as a final product on the other hand adhikary et al showed that non intermediaries were formed only acetic acids throughout hydrodechlorination of trichloroacetic acid catalyzed by gold nanocatalyst using sodium borohydride as a hydrogen source 125 scheme 4 briefs the hydrodechlorination pathways of trichloroacetic acid using hydrogen gas and sodium borohydride as hydrogen sources based on 109 125 report those two reports indicated that hydrogen sources influenced the chemical pathways throughout the hydrodehalogenation of halogenated dbps intermediary products formation or partial hydrodehalogenation throughout hydrodehalogenation of halogenated dbps should be avoided to prevent their clinic risks in drinking water 4 2 reaction medium aqueous medium is of great interest in the current discussion to understand the hydrodehalogenation of halogenated dbps and promote its implementation in water treatment technology direct and indirect hydrogenations were reported to advance the hydrodehalogenation of halogenated dbps in the absence of external hydrogen sources water hydrolysis released hydrogen ions at lower ph which can serve as hydrogen sources duan et al evaluated two catalytic systems composed of monometallic cu and bimetallic cu fe nanocatalysts to detail 4 chlorophenol hydrodehalogenation in acidic medium 126 both catalytic systems indicated a hydrodehalogenation activity for 4 chlorophenol direct hydrogenation on cu nanocatalyst led to higher hydrogenation compared to indirect hydrogenation on cu fe nanocatalyst electronic transfer governed the direct hydrogenation on monometallic catalyst where ionic spillover was noted on the surface of bimetallic nanocatalyst scheme 5 illustrates 4 chlorophenol hydrodehalogenation mechanism pathways based on direct and indirect hydrogenations on the surface of metal nanocatalysts cu fe bimetallic low catalytic activity went in contrary to the commune knowledge where cu metal bimetallic system often highly improved catalytic activity during hydrodehalogenation compared to the monometallic system 127 the contrary observation can be explained by the absence of external hydrogen sources such as sodium borohydride protic solvents mixture constructed with water and alcohol can serve as hydrogen sources throughout the reductive dehalogenation of halogenated dbps water methanol mixture as solvents has been well documented for synthetic and pollutants degradation purposes throughout the reductive dehalogenation of halogenated organic compounds 128 129 protic solvents mixture played a due role in the production and stabilization of hydrogen species which improved the reaction rate of the reductive dehalogenation of halogenated dbps huang et al designed cu nanoparticle and successfully evaluated that as a nanocatalyst to reduce dichloromethane in the presence of sodium borohydride 130 water methanol mixture as a reaction medium enhanced the dehalogenation rate of dichloromethane yoshio et al achieved an electroreductive dehalogenation of chloroform using various metal electrodes in acetonitrile water mixtures at high current density 131 in water treatment technology the aqua medium is preferable for the reductive dehalogenation of halogenated dbps although protic solvents mixture water alcohol improved the reaction rate of the hydrodehalogenation of halogenated dbps alcohol removal to reclaim potable water might be costing for water treatment plants 4 3 electroreductive dehalogenation the electrochemical system has been explored as an alternative approach for halogenated dbps reduction without the use of chemical reductants in some cases hydrogen species formations using chemical reductants can result in undesirable byproducts throughout the reductive dehalogenation of halogenated dbps electroreductive dehalogenation has been advanced to achieve a reductant free hydrodehalogenation of halogenated dbps metal semiconductors were largely explored as electrocatalysts to assist the electroreductive dehalogenation of halogenated dbps 132 134 electronic excitation of metal semiconductors generated active hydrogen species which initiated the reduction of halogenated dbps escobedo et al reported an electroreductive dehalogenation of 2 chlorophenol using dealloyed nanoporous pd ti cathode as an electrocatalyst 135 electroreductive analysis unveiled that electronic reduction of hydrogen molecular on the surface of dealloyed nanoporous generated hydrogen species which initiated the hydrodechlorination of 2 chlorophenol the designing and maintenance of electrochemical reactors are expensive and constituted a huge barrage to large scale implementation of electroreductive dehalogenation in water treatment plants in water treatment technology a single reactor has been promoted for electroreductive dehalogenation of halogenated dbps to minimize the technical budget and maintenance cost additionally scientific investigations have been expanded to develop robust and efficient electrocatalysts for consecutive electroreductive dehalogenation to improve the utility of electrochemical reactors transition metal nanocatalysts exceptional physicochemical properties promoted their interest in several electroreductive dehalogenation processes 118 136 137 mechanism pathway analysis through scavenging experiments indicated that electrocatalysts surface served as a platform on top of which hydrogen species and halogenated dbps interacted to produce the dehalogenated products 135 dauda et al conducted a cathodic reductive dehalogenation of halogenated dbps catalyzed by cobalt molybdate co mos2 electrocatalyst using a single electro reactor 136 the hydrothermal method was adapted for the synthesis of co mos2 electrocatalyst the cathodic reductive dehalogenation led to the 90 removal of halogenated dbps namely chcl3 chbr3 and chbr2cl in aqua phase scheme 6 a displays the single electro reactor applied to electro reduce halogenated dbps using co mos2 electrocatalyst the interfacial interaction between substrates and electrocatalyst constituted the rate determining step from which generated synergist effect and improved percentage removal of halogenated dbps in aqua phase the co mos2 electrocatalyst was stable and reusable for several recurring electroreductive dehalogenations liu et al constructed a composite electrocatalyst of cobalt phosphorous oxide co p o and evaluated that as an electrocatalyst for the electroreductive dehalogenation of halogenated antibiotics 138 the dual synergistic effect between co p o electrocatalyst and chlorine and co p o electrocatalyst and hydrogen species were found responsible for the reductive dehalogenation of halogenated antibiotic substances the synergistic effect of metal halogen and metal hydrogen interaction is shown in scheme 6 b 138 this illustrated that the synergist effect generated by interfacial interaction between halogenated dbps and electrocatalyst represented an essential step and governed the electrocatalytic rate of halogenated dbps reduction 5 conclusion microorganisms in drinking water cause severe health risks susceptible to lead to lifetime illness and or death water treatment technology promoted chlorine disinfection as an affordable and reliable approach to disinfect drinking water before the discharge in the distribution channels excess chlorine is used throughout chlorine disinfection to achieve a complete extermination of microorganisms that allowed free chlorine or free halogen in drinking water which interacted with natural organic matters and generated halogenated dbps epidemiology and clinic

hydrodehalogenation process palladium nanocatalysts received tremendous solicitation to facilitate the hydrodehalogenation of halogenated dbps hydrogen gas and sodium borohydride are the prevalent hydrogen sources applied for the formation of hydrogen species to achieve a fast hydrogenation of the cleaved halogen electroreductive hydrodehalogenation is of great interest in water treatment technology to advance reductant free hydrodehalogenation of halogenated dbps for the production of clean drinking water halogenated dbps and metal nanocatalysts engaged into an interfacial interaction which played a critical role in the progression of carbon halogen bonds cleavage towards the hydrogenation academic efforts are needed to investigate other transition metal nanoparticles and

13308,recently water pollution has become very serious especially with trace amounts of boron in solution in this work layered double hydroxide intercalated by gallic acid ga ldh a prospective candidate material for borate acid adsorption was synthesized for the first time by direct precipitation method using gallic acid ga magnesium nitrate and aluminum nitrate as raw materials the effects of ph reaction time initial concentration of boric acid coexisting ions and other factors on the adsorption capacity of ga ldh for b were analyzed the ga ldh adsorption capacity of 10 mg g 1 was reached via the optimized synthesis conditions and most importantly compared to conventional no3 ldh the adsorption of ga ldh on b is less disturbed by other ions the study on the adsorption mechanism revealed that ga ldh adsorbed boron by complex reaction between the hydroxyls of ga and b oh 3 or b oh 4 in solution adsorption kinetics thermodynamics and indicated the relationship between the equilibrium concentration of b in the solution and the b adsorption capacity at various temperatures followed the langmuir model and the reaction rate of b was mainly controlled by the chemisorption mechanism the elution efficiency could reach 75 by using nitric acid as an eluent graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords hydroxide gallic acid adsorb boron 1 introduction recently the shortage of fresh water resources due to population growth and industries climate change and lack of proper management has caused problems for the international community 1 3 therefore treatment of contaminated water and wastewater with a variety of emerging pollutants including metals dyes biodegradable waste phosphates and nitrates hazardous and toxic chemicals radioactive pollutants pharmaceuticals and personal care products 4 7 with a variety of advanced methods is an inevitable necessity boron is an indispensable trace element for animals and plants 8 11 but excessive boron in surface water would adversely affect plant cell division photosynthesis and respiration 12 14 excess inhaling of boron can inhibit the activity of digestive enzymes of animals causing loss of appetite indigestion etc 15 based on the above it is of great significance to separate and extract boron from the solution the main methods for boron extraction were acidification crystallization 16 adsorption 17 18 solvent extraction 19 20 and membrane separation 21 22 adsorption has become the most widely used method of extracting boron from solutions at present because of its environmental protection and simple technological properties 18 boron special resin is the most widely used adsorbent at present but its production process is complex and the cost is high 23 25 other inorganic adsorbents such as activated carbon 26 27 fly ash 28 29 and metal oxides 30 31 are simple but their selectivity is poor from the above it can be seen that the introduction of multi hydroxyl functional groups into the modified materials is a train of thought worthy of in depth study to improve the boron removal rate and realize the concept of high efficiency 32 ldhs intercalated by inorganic anions can be used for the separation and extraction of boron from solution with its interlayer anion exchangeability and roasting reducibility 33 34 but the adsorption capacity was always low and the selectivity was poor in recent years organic anions were intercalated into ldhs to obtain multifunctional materials with excellent performance to making hem versatile 35 38 anions with hydroxyls intercalated into ldhs can achieve specific adsorption of boron and reduce the interference of other coexisting ions in this experiment the gallic acid ga was used as the organic intercalation agent and layered double hydroxide

at 10 77 21 85 and 34 39 respectively can be seen on the pattern of no3 ldh and the basal distance of the d 003 crystal face was 8 22 å as reported in the former study 39 40 the d 003 diffraction peaks of ga ldh were located at 8 77 representing a d 003 of 10 09 å this indicated that ga anion had successfully entered into the interlayer of ga ldh the tem images of the no3 ldh and ga ldh were shown in fig 4 no3 ldh showed good dispersion and a regular hexagonal lamellar structure with the width and thickness of about 50 nm and 5 nm respectively and the width of ga ldh was about 100 nm the ft ir image of the no3 ldh and ga ldh were shown in fig 5 the absorption peaks at 3483 cm 1 1637 cm 1 and 624 cm 1 were the stretching vibration peak the bending modes peak and the vibrating modes peak of hydroxyl oh respectively 41 and the absorption peak at 1383 cm 1 was the symmetrical stretching vibration peak of nitro no3 for no3 ldh the spectra of ga ldh was different from that of no3 ldh the diffraction peak at 1547 cm 1 represented the skeleton vibration of benzene the strong peaks at 1385 cm 1 is due to β oh vibration and γ ch bending vibration commonly determined while a small peak at 1220 cm 1 and 1072 cm 1 was assigned to the stretching vibration of ν co and the peak at 760 cm 1 is due to γ ch vibration 42 these results also confirmed that ga was successfully intercalated into ga ldh the tg dta curves of the no3 ldh and ga ldh were shown in fig 6 the first weight loss peak of no3 ldh was at 110 200 c which was mainly the removal of interlayer water molecules and the mass loss ratio was12 the second strong weight loss peak was about 340 c and the mass loss ratio was as high as 23 mainly due to the destruction of hydrotalcite laminates and the removal of surface hydroxyl groups the first weight loss peak in the tg dta curve of ga ldh was about 102 c which was mainly due to the release of the absorption and interlayer water the second weight loss peak appearing at 352 c was caused by due to the destruction of hydrotalcite laminates and the removal of surface hydroxyl groups the second weight less peak of pb ldh has moved afterward compared to no3 ldh indicating that the addition of pb adds the stability of the ldh layer the third weight loss peak is located at 385 4 c mainly the decomposition of interlayer anions the contents of n and c in no3 ldh and ga ldh are shown in table 1 the n content in ga ldh decreased from 5 09 to 0 32 and the c content in ga ldh increased from 0 42 to 21 22 which confirmed that ga was successfully intercalated into ga ldh 3 2 effect of preparation of ga ldh on the adsorption capacity firstly the effect of the mg al ratio on the adsorption capacity was studied the corresponding xrd of ga ldh with the mg al ratio of 2 1 2 5 1 3 1 3 5 1 and 4 1 were shown in fig 7 the intercalation of ga was successful at different mg al but with the decrease of the mg al the d 003 peak of ga ldh moved to a low angle through their effect on b adsorption capacity in fig 8 the effect of the mg al ratio on ga ldh can be understood more clearly the high mg al ratio was not conducive to the adsorption of boron by ga ldh for two reasons microscopically as the mg al ratio increases the increase of the mg al ratio does not lead to an increase in the number of interlayer anions but decreased the mass fraction of interlayer anions shown in table 2 the actual content of ga was calculated by measuring the contents of c in ga ldh by and element analyzer because ga ldh contains a small amount of crystal water the actual content was lower than the theoretical content probably in order to decide the optimal amount of ga the corresponding xrd of ga ldh with al ga of 2 1 2 2 2 3 2 4 2 5 were shown in fig 9 however through the change of the adsorption capacity of ga ldh to b by different preparation conditions shown in fig 10 the best amount of ga can be determined the intercalation of ga was successful at different al ga ratios with the increase of the amount of ga the adsorption capacity gradually increased indicating that the interlayer anions of ldh were not totally exchanged by ga however when the amount of ga was twice of aluminum ions the filling capacity was basically saturated and the adsorption capacity was no longer increased the effect of aging temperature on the adsorption capacity of ga ldh was studied the aging temperature was set to 20 c 60 c 100 c 140 c and 180 c respectively and the corresponding xrd patterns were shown in fig 11 the 003 diffraction peaks of ldhs were located at 8 at a low temperature while at high temperature the d 003 diffraction peaks of ldhs were located at 8 this is due to the fact that ga decomposes at a high temperature to form co2 and it successfully enters the interlayer of ldhs resulting in the formation of co3 2 ldh guo et al 43 found that the change of ga at a high temperature can be divided into three stages the first stage was a phenolic hydroxyl fracture of ga at 65 135 c and the second stage was carboxyl cleavage at 135 305 c and the third stage of co2 formation was 305 382 c this was basically the same as the effect of aging temperature on ga ldh studied in this paper the adsorption capacity of ga ldh for b at different temperatures shown in fig 12 can also illustrate this point both 20 c and 60 c had a good adsorption effect but with the further increase of temperature the adsorption capacity decreased rapidly and the value at 180 c was only 2 3 of that at 20 c this indicated that high aging temperature was not conducive to the adsorption of boron by ga ldh also due to the fact that ga was decomposed at high temperature organic matter with the effective active groups decreased as result of the properties changing at high temperature through the above experiments the optimal preparation conditions for ga ldh were determined as follows the aging temperature of 20 c the mg al ratio of 2 1 and the al ga ratio of 1 2 all the ga ldh used in the subsequent experiments was synthesized under this preparation process 3 3 effect of solution ph on adsorption capacity the effect of the initial ph of the solution on the adsorption capacity of ga ldh was studied the initial ph of the solution was adjusted to 2 13 with nitric acid and sodium hydroxide the corresponding adsorption capacity was shown in fig 13 the adsorption of boron by ga ldh was more effective in the ph range of 5 10 but the adsorption capacity decreased significantly under acidic and alkaline conditions simulated fettle of b in aqueous solution under different ph by scdatabase when the ph was less than 5 b was mostly present in solution in the form of b oh 3 which had fewer active sites than b oh 4 and ga ldh as an alkaline substance was partially dissolved however when the ph was greater than 10 intermolecular dehydration would occur in ga resulting in the decrease of phenolic hydroxyl groups which further leads to the decrease of adsorption capacity therefore when the initial ph was less than 5 or greater than 10 the adsorption capacity of ga ldh on b decreased obviously we measured the point of zero charge zpc using the method in the literature 44 nano3 solution with a concentration of 0 1 mol l was prepared and the solution ph was adjusted to 2 12 using the nitric acid solution and naoh solution respectively 0 1 g of ga ldh was added to 10 ml of the configured solution and the ph value of the solution was measured after shaking for 72 h on a shaker and the difference between p and the initial ph after shaking was recorded as δph and the corresponding ph 2 under different initial ph was shown in fig 15 at lower ph the zpc is greater than zero because protons are adsorbed to the adsorption layer at lower ph protons are released from the oh group making the zpc less than zero when zpc is zero the initial ph of the solution is 8 55 which indicates that the phzpc of ga ldh is 8 55 this is similar to the phzpc reported in the literature for ldhs 45 on the one hand when the initial ph of the solution is less than phzpc the ga ldh surface carries positive points and mainly adsorbs negative ions in the solution on the other hand b in solution starts to form negatively charged b oh 4 ions at ph greater than 7 therefore the theoretical adsorption maximum of ga ldh on b in solution should be obtained between ph 7 8 5 which is consistent with the experimental results when the initial ph of the solution is greater than phzpc the surface of ga ldh is negatively charged and mainly adsorbs positively charged ions while all the b in the solution is in the form of b oh 4 so the adsorption capacity drops sharply 3 4 adsorption kinetics to determine the optimal reaction time the effect of adsorption time on the adsorption capacity of ga ldh was studied and the results were shown in fig 16 in the initial stage of the experiment the reaction rate was very fast at this time ga ldh has more active sites to provide adsorption and the higher concentration of b in the solution can effectively overcome the adsorption resistance and the reaction can reach equilibrium within two hours the pseudo first order kinetic model is as follows 3 l g q e q t l g q e k 1 2 303 t where qe and qt are the equilibrium adsorption capacity of ga ldh and the adsorption capacity at time t respectively k1 is the rate constant of the pseudo first order kinetic model 1 min 1 the plots of 1 qt versus t fig 17a were used to determine the values of k1 qe and correlation coefficients r2 and the results are shown in table 3 the pseudo second order model is as follows 46 4 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k2 is the rate constant of the pseudo second order kinetic model 1 min 1 the plots of 1 qt versus t fig 17b were used to determine the values of k2 qe and correlation coefficients r2 and the results are shown in table 3 as seen in table 3 the pseudo second order model better describes the adsorption process of ga ldh on b than pseudo first order because r2 of pseudo second order is closer to 1 and larger than r2 of pseudo first order in addition qe cal of pseudo second order is closer to qe exp 3 5 adsorption thermodynamics the effect of the initial concentration of b on the adsorption capacity of ga ldh at 20 c 40 c and 60 c was studied different masses of boric acid solids were weighed into 500 ml of deionized water to configure different concentrations of the initial solution of b the initial concentration of b was further determined by measuring the b concentration in the solution with icp oes the experimental results were shown in fig 18 at the same temperature the adsorption capacity of ga ldh increased linearly with the increase of the initial concentration of b the maximum amount of ga that exists in ga ldh is 4 mmol g and its theoretical maximum adsorption capacity is 4 mmol g b oh 4 but the adsorption of b at an initial concentration is 2500 mg l 1 was greater than 4 mmol b oh 4 this is due to the form in which b is present in the aqueous solution with the b concentration increases it will exist in the form of b3o3 oh 4 b4o5 oh 4 2 and b5o6 oh 4 etc 47 resulting in a further increase in adsorption capacity fig 19 the adsorption thermodynamics of ga ldg on b was fitted using the langmuir and freundlich models the langmuir model 5 1 q e 1 c e b q m 1 q m where ce is the concentration of b in the equilibrium filtrate k is the langmuir equilibrium constant and b is the langmuir constant related to the affinity of binding sites plotting 1 qe against 1 ce the langmuir model is satisfied if it is a straight line the langmuir model of adsorption is due to the high adsorption force of the single molecular layer and the high reactivity of the adsorption sites on the surface it is an electron transfer type adsorption interaction which is mostly irreversible and is considered chemisorption the freundlich model 6 lg q e 1 n lg c e lg q t where n is representing the intensity of adsorption plotting lgqe against lgce the freundlich model is satisfied if it is a straight line the freundlich model has the following characteristics at infinitely dilute concentrations the value of the slope 0 of the adsorption isotherm which indicates the ease with which adsorption occurs for the first molecule at the very beginning is infinite when the concentration becomes very high the adsorption increases to infinity which is thermodynamically impossible this equation is empirical as shown in figs 20 22 the langmuir and freundlich models were analyzed for the three temperatures and the results were shown in table 4 the relationship between the equilibrium concentration of b in the solution and the b adsorption capacity at these temperatures was all consistent with the langmuir model gibbs free energy δg enthalpy δh and entropy δs are calculated by the following equation 7 δg rtln k d 8 ln k d δs r δh rt where r is the ideal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 the kelvin temperature of t k and kd is the distribution coefficient of adsorbent ml g 1 and equal to qe ce 48 graph 1 t against kd and calculate δh and δs from the slope and intercept of the line the results of the calculation are shown in table 5 at the temperature and concentration set in this experiment the δg of the reaction is less than zero indicating that the reaction can proceed spontaneously at the altered temperature δh is greater than zero indicating that the adsorption of ga ldh on b is a heat absorption reaction δs is greater than zero indicating that the chaos of the system increases after the reaction 49 3 6 interference of coexisting ions the interference of coexisting ions on the adsorption capacity were studied cl so4 2 and li were introduced into the b contained solution as shown in fig 23 the adsorption capacity of ga ldh and no3 ldh decreased slightly with the gradual increase of initial cl concentration but that of ga ldh was generally at a higher level when the concentration of cl was 1 5 mol l 1 its boron adsorption capacity was only half of the original ones the initial concentration of so4 2 had a great influence on the adsorption capacity of ga ldh fig 24 when the initial concentration of so4 2 reached 0 75 mol l 1 the capacity of b adsorbed by ga ldh was only half of the amount at the initial so4 2 concentration compared to no3 ldh so4 2 had a greater influence on it and the existence of so4 2 would reduce the b adsorption capacity of no3 ldh to about 3 mg l 1 the effect of anions on the adsorption of b by ga ldh was mainly due to the anion interchangeability between the ldh layers in contrast to no3 ldh cl and so4 2 would replace the ga anion between the ga ldh layers resulting in a decrease in the active site of ga ldh and thereby reducing b adsorption capacity the order of anion exchangeability between ldh layers was as follows co3 2 oh so4 2 hpo4 2 f cl br no3 i this indicated that so4 2 was more likely to enter the ldh interlayer compared to cl and the least solution was exchanged by other ions so the effect of so4 2 on the adsorption of b by ga ldh was much greater than that of cl in terms of cations we chose li as a reference as shown in fig 25 ga in ga ldh mainly adsorbed substances containing polyhydroxy groups and ldh itself also adsorbed some anions so li had no effect on the adsorption of b by the experimental results we found that ga ldh also adsorbed lithium and this adsorption was mostly through surface adsorption 3 7 adsorption mechanism ga ldh and no3 ldh were found to have different adsorption mechanisms through experimental studies fig 26 showed the ft ir diagram of no3 ldh before and after adsorption there was a significant weakening of the characteristic peak at 1380 cm 1 after adsorption which indicated that the no3 in no3 ldh was replaced by b oh 4 in solution after adsorption and the reaction mechanism should be ion exchange fig 27 showed the ft ir spectra of ga ldh before and after adsorption unlike no3 ldh there was no obvious change in the stretching vibration peaks of co at 1220 cm 1 and 1070 cm 1 before and after ga ldh adsorption which indicated that there was no obvious change in ga after adsorption it further showed that the adsorption of b by ga ldh was not ion exchange but the interaction between the hydroxyls of ga and b this can also be proved by the content changes of c and n in ldhs table 6 after no3 ldh adsorbed b no3 ldh b the content of n decreased from 5 09 to 0 97 this shows that no3 ldh adsorbs b through ion exchange between no3 and b oh 4 however there was no apparent change in the content of c in ga ldh after b adsorption ga ldh b which showed that the adsorption of b by ga ldh was the interaction between the hydroxyls of ga and b this mechanism of action was similarly confirmed by the effect of different ph on the b adsorption capacity only the anion in solution i e b oh 4 can have ion exchange interaction with no3 ldh however most of the boron in solution at ph lower than 6 was in the form of b oh 3 fig 14 and ga ldh still showed good adsorption properties for b this adsorption could only be achieved by the interaction of the hydroxyls of ga with that of b oh 3 through the above three points we can conclude that ga ldh and no3 ldh had different adsorption mechanisms as shown in fig 28 boron adsorption by no3 ldh occurred through ion exchange between no3 in the no3 ldh interlayer and b oh 4 in solution while boron adsorption by ga ldh occurred through the interaction of the reactive groups on ga located between ga ldh layers with the hydroxyls of b oh 4 in the solution fig 29 3 8 research on the elution of ga ldh based on the mechanism of interaction between ga ldh and b this study decided to separate b from ga ldh by means of acid pickling to avoid the introduction of too many interfering ions nitric acid was finally selected as the eluent firstly the effect of nitric acid concentration on the elution rate was investigated and the result was shown in fig 30 the elution rate gradually increased with the increase of nitric acid concentration it was noteworthy that the b elution rate remained around 45 when deionized water was used as the eluent when the nitric acid concentration reached 0 15 mol l 1 the b elution rate reached 70 but the ldh already appeared partially dissolved at this time therefore 0 10 mol l 1 nitric acid was used as the eluent for the subsequent experiments as shown in fig 31 the effect of the solid liquid ratio on the elution rate was studied with the increase of the solid liquid ratio the elution rate gradually increased when the solid liquid ratio reached 1 80 the reaction tended to equilibrium and the elution rate reached 75 however the volume of the eluent was larger than the initial b solution volume t and it is not possible to achieve the effect of concentrated enrichment therefore 1 60 was chosen as the solid liquid ratio for the subsequent reaction the effect of elution time on the elution rate was studied and the result was shown in fig 32 with the increase of time the elution rate gradually increased the elution rate could still reach 60 for an elution time of 0 5 h and the elution rate could reach 75 when the reaction proceeded to 4 h 4 conclusion in this experiment a series of ga ldhs was successfully synthesized and its adsorption process was optimized research shows that this is a rapidly developing prospect for boron adsorbents the optimal preparation conditions for ga ldh were determined under these optimal adsorption conditions the adsorption capacity of ga ldh for b was up to 10 mg g 1 in addition ga ldh is less affected by other interfering ions than conventional hydrotalcite adsorption kinetics indicated the reaction rate of b adsorption was mainly controlled by the chemisorption mechanism and adsorption thermodynamics revealed that this reaction is heat absorbing and can proceed spontaneously at room temperature it was proved that the adsorption mechanism of boron by ga ldh and no3 ldh was different no3 ldh adsorbed boron through ion exchange between anions in the interlayer and b oh 4 in the solution while ga ldh adsorbed boron by hydroxyl interactions between the hydroxyls of ga and b oh 3 and b oh 4 in solution this mechanism of action also made the elution of b possible in this study nitric acid was used as an eluent for the first time and the elution rate of b could reach 75 novelty statement 1 layered double hydroxide intercalated

13308,recently water pollution has become very serious especially with trace amounts of boron in solution in this work layered double hydroxide intercalated by gallic acid ga ldh a prospective candidate material for borate acid adsorption was synthesized for the first time by direct precipitation method using gallic acid ga magnesium nitrate and aluminum nitrate as raw materials the effects of ph reaction time initial concentration of boric acid coexisting ions and other factors on the adsorption capacity of ga ldh for b were analyzed the ga ldh adsorption capacity of 10 mg g 1 was reached via the optimized synthesis conditions and most importantly compared to conventional no3 ldh the adsorption of ga ldh on b is less disturbed by other ions the study on the adsorption mechanism revealed that ga ldh adsorbed boron by complex reaction between the hydroxyls of ga and b oh 3 or b oh 4 in solution adsorption kinetics thermodynamics and indicated the relationship between the equilibrium concentration of b in the solution and the b adsorption capacity at various temperatures followed the langmuir model and the reaction rate of b was mainly controlled by the chemisorption mechanism the elution efficiency could reach 75 by using nitric acid as an eluent graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords hydroxide gallic acid adsorb boron 1 introduction recently the shortage of fresh water resources due to population growth and industries climate change and lack of proper management has caused problems for the international community 1 3 therefore treatment of contaminated water and wastewater with a variety of emerging pollutants including metals dyes biodegradable waste phosphates and nitrates hazardous and toxic chemicals radioactive pollutants pharmaceuticals and personal care products 4 7 with a variety of advanced methods is an inevitable necessity boron is an indispensable trace element for animals and plants 8 11 but excessive boron in surface water would adversely affect plant cell division photosynthesis and respiration 12 14 excess inhaling of boron can inhibit the activity of digestive enzymes of animals causing loss of appetite indigestion etc 15 based on the above it is of great significance to separate and extract boron from the solution the main methods for boron extraction were acidification crystallization 16 adsorption 17 18 solvent extraction 19 20 and membrane separation 21 22 adsorption has become the most widely used method of extracting boron from solutions at present because of its environmental protection and simple technological properties 18 boron special resin is the most widely used adsorbent at present but its production process is complex and the cost is high 23 25 other inorganic adsorbents such as activated carbon 26 27 fly ash 28 29 and metal oxides 30 31 are simple but their selectivity is poor from the above it can be seen that the introduction of multi hydroxyl functional groups into the modified materials is a train of thought worthy of in depth study to improve the boron removal rate and realize the concept of high efficiency 32 ldhs intercalated by inorganic anions can be used for the separation and extraction of boron from solution with its interlayer anion exchangeability and roasting reducibility 33 34 but the adsorption capacity was always low and the selectivity was poor in recent years organic anions were intercalated into ldhs to obtain multifunctional materials with excellent performance to making hem versatile 35 38 anions with hydroxyls intercalated into ldhs can achieve specific adsorption of boron and reduce the interference of other coexisting ions in this experiment the gallic acid ga was used as the organic intercalation agent and layered double hydroxide intercalated by gallic acid ga ldh was prepared by one step precipitation method to adsorb boron in solution fig 1 we optimized the adsorption conditions to achieve the best adsorption efficiency

at 10 77 21 85 and 34 39 respectively can be seen on the pattern of no3 ldh and the basal distance of the d 003 crystal face was 8 22 å as reported in the former study 39 40 the d 003 diffraction peaks of ga ldh were located at 8 77 representing a d 003 of 10 09 å this indicated that ga anion had successfully entered into the interlayer of ga ldh the tem images of the no3 ldh and ga ldh were shown in fig 4 no3 ldh showed good dispersion and a regular hexagonal lamellar structure with the width and thickness of about 50 nm and 5 nm respectively and the width of ga ldh was about 100 nm the ft ir image of the no3 ldh and ga ldh were shown in fig 5 the absorption peaks at 3483 cm 1 1637 cm 1 and 624 cm 1 were the stretching vibration peak the bending modes peak and the vibrating modes peak of hydroxyl oh respectively 41 and the absorption peak at 1383 cm 1 was the symmetrical stretching vibration peak of nitro no3 for no3 ldh the spectra of ga ldh was different from that of no3 ldh the diffraction peak at 1547 cm 1 represented the skeleton vibration of benzene the strong peaks at 1385 cm 1 is due to β oh vibration and γ ch bending vibration commonly determined while a small peak at 1220 cm 1 and 1072 cm 1 was assigned to the stretching vibration of ν co and the peak at 760 cm 1 is due to γ ch vibration 42 these results also confirmed that ga was successfully intercalated into ga ldh the tg dta curves of the no3 ldh and ga ldh were shown in fig 6 the first weight loss peak of no3 ldh was at 110 200 c which was mainly the removal of interlayer water molecules and the mass loss ratio was12 the second strong weight loss peak was about 340 c and the mass loss ratio was as high as 23 mainly due to the destruction of hydrotalcite laminates and the removal of surface hydroxyl groups the first weight loss peak in the tg dta curve of ga ldh was about 102 c which was mainly due to the release of the absorption and interlayer water the second weight loss peak appearing at 352 c was caused by due to the destruction of hydrotalcite laminates and the removal of surface hydroxyl groups the second weight less peak of pb ldh has moved afterward compared to no3 ldh indicating that the addition of pb adds the stability of the ldh layer the third weight loss peak is located at 385 4 c mainly the decomposition of interlayer anions the contents of n and c in no3 ldh and ga ldh are shown in table 1 the n content in ga ldh decreased from 5 09 to 0 32 and the c content in ga ldh increased from 0 42 to 21 22 which confirmed that ga was successfully intercalated into ga ldh 3 2 effect of preparation of ga ldh on the adsorption capacity firstly the effect of the mg al ratio on the adsorption capacity was studied the corresponding xrd of ga ldh with the mg al ratio of 2 1 2 5 1 3 1 3 5 1 and 4 1 were shown in fig 7 the intercalation of ga was successful at different mg al but with the decrease of the mg al the d 003 peak of ga ldh moved to a low angle through their effect on b adsorption capacity in fig 8 the effect of the mg al ratio on ga ldh can be understood more clearly the high mg al ratio was not conducive to the adsorption of boron by ga ldh for two reasons microscopically as the mg al ratio increases the increase of the mg al ratio does not lead to an increase in the number of interlayer anions but decreased the mass fraction of interlayer anions shown in table 2 the actual content of ga was calculated by measuring the contents of c in ga ldh by and element analyzer because ga ldh contains a small amount of crystal water the actual content was lower than the theoretical content probably in order to decide the optimal amount of ga the corresponding xrd of ga ldh with al ga of 2 1 2 2 2 3 2 4 2 5 were shown in fig 9 however through the change of the adsorption capacity of ga ldh to b by different preparation conditions shown in fig 10 the best amount of ga can be determined the intercalation of ga was successful at different al ga ratios with the increase of the amount of ga the adsorption capacity gradually increased indicating that the interlayer anions of ldh were not totally exchanged by ga however when the amount of ga was twice of aluminum ions the filling capacity was basically saturated and the adsorption capacity was no longer increased the effect of aging temperature on the adsorption capacity of ga ldh was studied the aging temperature was set to 20 c 60 c 100 c 140 c and 180 c respectively and the corresponding xrd patterns were shown in fig 11 the 003 diffraction peaks of ldhs were located at 8 at a low temperature while at high temperature the d 003 diffraction peaks of ldhs were located at 8 this is due to the fact that ga decomposes at a high temperature to form co2 and it successfully enters the interlayer of ldhs resulting in the formation of co3 2 ldh guo et al 43 found that the change of ga at a high temperature can be divided into three stages the first stage was a phenolic hydroxyl fracture of ga at 65 135 c and the second stage was carboxyl cleavage at 135 305 c and the third stage of co2 formation was 305 382 c this was basically the same as the effect of aging temperature on ga ldh studied in this paper the adsorption capacity of ga ldh for b at different temperatures shown in fig 12 can also illustrate this point both 20 c and 60 c had a good adsorption effect but with the further increase of temperature the adsorption capacity decreased rapidly and the value at 180 c was only 2 3 of that at 20 c this indicated that high aging temperature was not conducive to the adsorption of boron by ga ldh also due to the fact that ga was decomposed at high temperature organic matter with the effective active groups decreased as result of the properties changing at high temperature through the above experiments the optimal preparation conditions for ga ldh were determined as follows the aging temperature of 20 c the mg al ratio of 2 1 and the al ga ratio of 1 2 all the ga ldh used in the subsequent experiments was synthesized under this preparation process 3 3 effect of solution ph on adsorption capacity the effect of the initial ph of the solution on the adsorption capacity of ga ldh was studied the initial ph of the solution was adjusted to 2 13 with nitric acid and sodium hydroxide the corresponding adsorption capacity was shown in fig 13 the adsorption of boron by ga ldh was more effective in the ph range of 5 10 but the adsorption capacity decreased significantly under acidic and alkaline conditions simulated fettle of b in aqueous solution under different ph by scdatabase when the ph was less than 5 b was mostly present in solution in the form of b oh 3 which had fewer active sites than b oh 4 and ga ldh as an alkaline substance was partially dissolved however when the ph was greater than 10 intermolecular dehydration would occur in ga resulting in the decrease of phenolic hydroxyl groups which further leads to the decrease of adsorption capacity therefore when the initial ph was less than 5 or greater than 10 the adsorption capacity of ga ldh on b decreased obviously we measured the point of zero charge zpc using the method in the literature 44 nano3 solution with a concentration of 0 1 mol l was prepared and the solution ph was adjusted to 2 12 using the nitric acid solution and naoh solution respectively 0 1 g of ga ldh was added to 10 ml of the configured solution and the ph value of the solution was measured after shaking for 72 h on a shaker and the difference between p and the initial ph after shaking was recorded as δph and the corresponding ph 2 under different initial ph was shown in fig 15 at lower ph the zpc is greater than zero because protons are adsorbed to the adsorption layer at lower ph protons are released from the oh group making the zpc less than zero when zpc is zero the initial ph of the solution is 8 55 which indicates that the phzpc of ga ldh is 8 55 this is similar to the phzpc reported in the literature for ldhs 45 on the one hand when the initial ph of the solution is less than phzpc the ga ldh surface carries positive points and mainly adsorbs negative ions in the solution on the other hand b in solution starts to form negatively charged b oh 4 ions at ph greater than 7 therefore the theoretical adsorption maximum of ga ldh on b in solution should be obtained between ph 7 8 5 which is consistent with the experimental results when the initial ph of the solution is greater than phzpc the surface of ga ldh is negatively charged and mainly adsorbs positively charged ions while all the b in the solution is in the form of b oh 4 so the adsorption capacity drops sharply 3 4 adsorption kinetics to determine the optimal reaction time the effect of adsorption time on the adsorption capacity of ga ldh was studied and the results were shown in fig 16 in the initial stage of the experiment the reaction rate was very fast at this time ga ldh has more active sites to provide adsorption and the higher concentration of b in the solution can effectively overcome the adsorption resistance and the reaction can reach equilibrium within two hours the pseudo first order kinetic model is as follows 3 l g q e q t l g q e k 1 2 303 t where qe and qt are the equilibrium adsorption capacity of ga ldh and the adsorption capacity at time t respectively k1 is the rate constant of the pseudo first order kinetic model 1 min 1 the plots of 1 qt versus t fig 17a were used to determine the values of k1 qe and correlation coefficients r2 and the results are shown in table 3 the pseudo second order model is as follows 46 4 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k2 is the rate constant of the pseudo second order kinetic model 1 min 1 the plots of 1 qt versus t fig 17b were used to determine the values of k2 qe and correlation coefficients r2 and the results are shown in table 3 as seen in table 3 the pseudo second order model better describes the adsorption process of ga ldh on b than pseudo first order because r2 of pseudo second order is closer to 1 and larger than r2 of pseudo first order in addition qe cal of pseudo second order is closer to qe exp 3 5 adsorption thermodynamics the effect of the initial concentration of b on the adsorption capacity of ga ldh at 20 c 40 c and 60 c was studied different masses of boric acid solids were weighed into 500 ml of deionized water to configure different concentrations of the initial solution of b the initial concentration of b was further determined by measuring the b concentration in the solution with icp oes the experimental results were shown in fig 18 at the same temperature the adsorption capacity of ga ldh increased linearly with the increase of the initial concentration of b the maximum amount of ga that exists in ga ldh is 4 mmol g and its theoretical maximum adsorption capacity is 4 mmol g b oh 4 but the adsorption of b at an initial concentration is 2500 mg l 1 was greater than 4 mmol b oh 4 this is due to the form in which b is present in the aqueous solution with the b concentration increases it will exist in the form of b3o3 oh 4 b4o5 oh 4 2 and b5o6 oh 4 etc 47 resulting in a further increase in adsorption capacity fig 19 the adsorption thermodynamics of ga ldg on b was fitted using the langmuir and freundlich models the langmuir model 5 1 q e 1 c e b q m 1 q m where ce is the concentration of b in the equilibrium filtrate k is the langmuir equilibrium constant and b is the langmuir constant related to the affinity of binding sites plotting 1 qe against 1 ce the langmuir model is satisfied if it is a straight line the langmuir model of adsorption is due to the high adsorption force of the single molecular layer and the high reactivity of the adsorption sites on the surface it is an electron transfer type adsorption interaction which is mostly irreversible and is considered chemisorption the freundlich model 6 lg q e 1 n lg c e lg q t where n is representing the intensity of adsorption plotting lgqe against lgce the freundlich model is satisfied if it is a straight line the freundlich model has the following characteristics at infinitely dilute concentrations the value of the slope 0 of the adsorption isotherm which indicates the ease with which adsorption occurs for the first molecule at the very beginning is infinite when the concentration becomes very high the adsorption increases to infinity which is thermodynamically impossible this equation is empirical as shown in figs 20 22 the langmuir and freundlich models were analyzed for the three temperatures and the results were shown in table 4 the relationship between the equilibrium concentration of b in the solution and the b adsorption capacity at these temperatures was all consistent with the langmuir model gibbs free energy δg enthalpy δh and entropy δs are calculated by the following equation 7 δg rtln k d 8 ln k d δs r δh rt where r is the ideal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 the kelvin temperature of t k and kd is the distribution coefficient of adsorbent ml g 1 and equal to qe ce 48 graph 1 t against kd and calculate δh and δs from the slope and intercept of the line the results of the calculation are shown in table 5 at the temperature and concentration set in this experiment the δg of the reaction is less than zero indicating that the reaction can proceed spontaneously at the altered temperature δh is greater than zero indicating that the adsorption of ga ldh on b is a heat absorption reaction δs is greater than zero indicating that the chaos of the system increases after the reaction 49 3 6 interference of coexisting ions the interference of coexisting ions on the adsorption capacity were studied cl so4 2 and li were introduced into the b contained solution as shown in fig 23 the adsorption capacity of ga ldh and no3 ldh decreased slightly with the gradual increase of initial cl concentration but that of ga ldh was generally at a higher level when the concentration of cl was 1 5 mol l 1 its boron adsorption capacity was only half of the original ones the initial concentration of so4 2 had a great influence on the adsorption capacity of ga ldh fig 24 when the initial concentration of so4 2 reached 0 75 mol l 1 the capacity of b adsorbed by ga ldh was only half of the amount at the initial so4 2 concentration compared to no3 ldh so4 2 had a greater influence on it and the existence of so4 2 would reduce the b adsorption capacity of no3 ldh to about 3 mg l 1 the effect of anions on the adsorption of b by ga ldh was mainly due to the anion interchangeability between the ldh layers in contrast to no3 ldh cl and so4 2 would replace the ga anion between the ga ldh layers resulting in a decrease in the active site of ga ldh and thereby reducing b adsorption capacity the order of anion exchangeability between ldh layers was as follows co3 2 oh so4 2 hpo4 2 f cl br no3 i this indicated that so4 2 was more likely to enter the ldh interlayer compared to cl and the least solution was exchanged by other ions so the effect of so4 2 on the adsorption of b by ga ldh was much greater than that of cl in terms of cations we chose li as a reference as shown in fig 25 ga in ga ldh mainly adsorbed substances containing polyhydroxy groups and ldh itself also adsorbed some anions so li had no effect on the adsorption of b by the experimental results we found that ga ldh also adsorbed lithium and this adsorption was mostly through surface adsorption 3 7 adsorption mechanism ga ldh and no3 ldh were found to have different adsorption mechanisms through experimental studies fig 26 showed the ft ir diagram of no3 ldh before and after adsorption there was a significant weakening of the characteristic peak at 1380 cm 1 after adsorption which indicated that the no3 in no3 ldh was replaced by b oh 4 in solution after adsorption and the reaction mechanism should be ion exchange fig 27 showed the ft ir spectra of ga ldh before and after adsorption unlike no3 ldh there was no obvious change in the stretching vibration peaks of co at 1220 cm 1 and 1070 cm 1 before and after ga ldh adsorption which indicated that there was no obvious change in ga after adsorption it further showed that the adsorption of b by ga ldh was not ion exchange but the interaction between the hydroxyls of ga and b this can also be proved by the content changes of c and n in ldhs table 6 after no3 ldh adsorbed b no3 ldh b the content of n decreased from 5 09 to 0 97 this shows that no3 ldh adsorbs b through ion exchange between no3 and b oh 4 however there was no apparent change in the content of c in ga ldh after b adsorption ga ldh b which showed that the adsorption of b by ga ldh was the interaction between the hydroxyls of ga and b this mechanism of action was similarly confirmed by the effect of different ph on the b adsorption capacity only the anion in solution i e b oh 4 can have ion exchange interaction with no3 ldh however most of the boron in solution at ph lower than 6 was in the form of b oh 3 fig 14 and ga ldh still showed good adsorption properties for b this adsorption could only be achieved by the interaction of the hydroxyls of ga with that of b oh 3 through the above three points we can conclude that ga ldh and no3 ldh had different adsorption mechanisms as shown in fig 28 boron adsorption by no3 ldh occurred through ion exchange between no3 in the no3 ldh interlayer and b oh 4 in solution while boron adsorption by ga ldh occurred through the interaction of the reactive groups on ga located between ga ldh layers with the hydroxyls of b oh 4 in the solution fig 29 3 8 research on the elution of ga ldh based on the mechanism of interaction between ga ldh and b this study decided to separate b from ga ldh by means of acid pickling to avoid the introduction of too many interfering ions nitric acid was finally selected as the eluent firstly the effect of nitric acid concentration on the elution rate was investigated and the result was shown in fig 30 the elution rate gradually increased with the increase of nitric acid concentration it was noteworthy that the b elution rate remained around 45 when deionized water was used as the eluent when the nitric acid concentration reached 0 15 mol l 1 the b elution rate reached 70 but the ldh already appeared partially dissolved at this time therefore 0 10 mol l 1 nitric acid was used as the eluent for the subsequent experiments as shown in fig 31 the effect of the solid liquid ratio on the elution rate was studied with the increase of the solid liquid ratio the elution rate gradually increased when the solid liquid ratio reached 1 80 the reaction tended to equilibrium and the elution rate reached 75 however the volume of the eluent was larger than the initial b solution volume t and it is not possible to achieve the effect of concentrated enrichment therefore 1 60 was chosen as the solid liquid ratio for the subsequent reaction the effect of elution time on the elution rate was studied and the result was shown in fig 32 with the increase of time the elution rate gradually increased the elution rate could still reach 60 for an elution time of 0 5 h and the elution rate could reach 75 when the reaction proceeded to 4 h 4 conclusion in this experiment a series of ga ldhs was successfully synthesized and its adsorption process was optimized research shows that this is a rapidly developing prospect for boron adsorbents the optimal preparation conditions for ga ldh were determined under these optimal adsorption conditions the adsorption capacity of ga ldh for b was up to 10 mg g 1 in addition ga ldh is less affected by other interfering ions than conventional hydrotalcite adsorption kinetics indicated the reaction rate of b adsorption was mainly controlled by the chemisorption mechanism and adsorption thermodynamics revealed that this reaction is heat absorbing and can proceed spontaneously at room temperature it was proved that the adsorption mechanism of boron by ga ldh and no3 ldh was different no3 ldh adsorbed boron through ion exchange between anions in the interlayer and b oh 4 in the solution while ga ldh adsorbed boron by hydroxyl interactions between the hydroxyls of ga and b oh 3 and b oh 4 in solution this mechanism of action also made the elution of b possible in this study nitric acid was used as an eluent for the first time and the elution rate of b could reach 75 novelty statement 1 layered double hydroxide intercalated gallic acid was synthesized by direct precipitation method compared with traditional ldh ga ldh greatly improves the selectivity of boron and reduces the interference of coexisting ions 2 reveal the adsorption mechanism of no3 ldh and ga ldh to b 3 nitric acid solution was used as eluent to analyze ga ldh and the elution rate could reach 75 declaration of competing interest the authors declare

13309,the use of membranes in integrated water systems has garnered increasing attention in paper mills operating with virgin fibres with documented closed water loops in industry however limited research exists on the performance of ultrafiltration uf in mills operating with 100 recycled fibres rcf and closed water systems as these result in the introduction and accumulation of insoluble contaminants in the effluent this study investigated the effect of transmembrane pressure tmp and feed organic load on the flux types of fouling and organic separation with uf membranes in a recycled paper mill using 100 rcf the high feed organic load caused inevitable fouling limiting the highest achievable flux however the tmp could be manipulated to improve on or exacerbate the process performance within the range that was set as a result of the feed s characteristics low tmp 1 35 bar generated the highest permeability and chemical oxygen demand removal while higher tmps produced higher fluxes and recoveries the process was characterised by high initial fluxes followed by cake formation which dominated and pore blockage the excess cake formation induced cake filtration this study shows the potential of uf membranes to be used as pre treatment in filtering the process water in a recycled paper mill operating with 100 rcf a critical step forward in implementing an integrated water system and eventually closing the water loop graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ultrafiltration recycled paper mill cod cake formation water system closure 1 introduction papermaking requires large quantities of virgin fibres and water 1 as a result global trends such as the overexploitation and growing scarcity of natural resources continue to exert additional stress on the pulp and paper industry in order to address this two different approaches widely investigated include re pulping of recycled fibres rcf and water system closure by recycling water streams 2 the former has been reported to minimise waste generation and decrease pulping costs 3 however the introduction of rcf adds non fibrous and insoluble contaminants while system closure results in the accumulation of dissolved and colloidal materials impeding the pulping process 4 consequently there is a need to design efficient water treatment schemes to allow the streams to be fully reused for a sustainable closed loop water system clws one method gathering increasing attention is membrane filtration which was first investigated in the pulp and paper industry in the late 1960s 5 over time membrane technology has proven to be a flexible and efficient treatment process for treating and reusing wastewater streams due to the reduced variation in the quality of the effluents and the simple automation of the processes 6 many studies have analysed the performance of membrane systems to treat water streams from virgin fibre production zhang et al 7 investigated black liquor pulp bleaching effluent and paper machine white water pmww treatment in an integrated membrane process this comprised physical and chemical pre treatments followed by a membrane bioreactor mbr microfiltration mf and reverse osmosis ro they noted that the mbr separated the majority of the soluble organic substances and suspended solids ultimately achieving 60 recovery at the ro stage with acceptable permeate quality for mill reuse richardson et al 8 studied the feasibility of removing inorganic salts from pmww to produce effluents acceptable for irrigation using a multi stage mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf and ro pilot plant however they found that nf was unable to separate acceptable levels of sodium ions resulting in excessive fouling at the ro stage in addition fouling was exacerbated by scaling in the ro membranes due to bicarbonate precipitation the mckinley mill in new mexico has been operating with zero effluent discharge since 1994 9 their system comprises a disc screen and cyclic activated sludge system as pre treatment followed by uf and ro and an evaporative crystalliser their success lies in integrating their water treatment scheme into the paper mill s operational design for instance part of the uf membrane permeate is recycled into the mill s process water pw instead of the entire filtrate being sent to the ro membrane the mckinley mill demonstrates the importance of implementing the kidney approach in closing the water loop this strategy focuses on directly treating and recycling internal effluents to reduce the operational strain of treating the end of pipe wastewater stream 10 while success has been achieved for virgin fibre mills there is limited research on the performance of membrane systems in mills using a fraction of recycled fibres negaresh 2 investigated nf as a pre treatment to ro in a plant operating with 0 to 50 recycled newsprint fibre they concluded that sodium and silica severely affected the performance of the membrane achieving only 22 water recovery at the ro stage at 50 rcf richardson et al 11 treated 40 rcf filtrate using a three stage uf nf and ro pilot plant noting that fouling at the nf stage prevented the implementation of such system eventually the pilot plant was decomissioned as excessive fouling could not be controlled due to the lack of process optimisation particularly they were unable to reduce the chemical oxygen demand cod to acceptable levels prior to the nf stage which could have potentially been achieved with sufficient pre treatment as observed in the mckinley mill so far there have been no published investigations on the performance of uf in mills operating with 100 rcf and restricted water systems as the majority of industrial uf membranes employed in the pulp and paper industry are used to recover coating colours and to treat pmww 5 since uf is the most widely used and established membrane process in the pulp and paper industry and therefore has considerable existing infrastructure and associated operational knowledge it seems sensible to explore its potential for broader applications including clwss in recycled paper mills one of the major hindrances to the implementation of membrane technology in any industry is membrane fouling 5 a challenge also identified for membrane filtration of rcf 11 as the permeate flow is inherently governed by fouling 12 four fouling mechanism models for ultrafiltration membranes were developed by hermia 13 complete blocking intermediate blocking standard blocking and cake layer formation the causes for the fouling phenomena can be inferred by analysing the effects of transmembrane pressure tmp and feed organic load on the fouling type and flux little research exists on the applications of these models in mills using rcf sousa et al 14 applied them however their feed was sourced from the wastewater treatment plant of the recycled paper mill reducing the concentration of contaminants they concluded that the mechanism controlling fouling was intermediate blocking xu et al 15 investigated fouling mechanisms in a recycled paper mill however their focus was on the performance of using upstream coagulation and fenton pre treatment prior to uf ultimately with the success of closed loops in mills operating with virgin fibres there is high potential to achieve system closure in recycled paper mills when using the kidney approach in addition there is a lack of knowledge on the fouling modes for ultrafiltration membranes in such mills as well as the pw characteristics this inhibits the development of sustainable effluent management and water closure systems as observed in the decommissioned pilot plant by 11 uf systems are pressure driven processes and rcf effluents are characterised by high cod which may vary drastically from day to day due to the heterogeneous nature of the recycled feed this study therefore investigated the effects of tmp and organic load on the fouling mechanisms in uf membranes when treating the pw from a recycled paper mill operating with 100 rcf the resulting flux and quality of the permeate were also investigated as a result a critical foundation was determined for the potential use of ultrafiltration membrane technology as pre treatment using the kidney approach by evaluating uf s performance in filtering the process water in mills fully operating with rcf this study provides a critical step forward in integrating a complete water treatment scheme and eventually closing the loop towards cleaner production 2 materials and methods 2 1 recycled paper mill process water the feed was taken from a clarifier with a 20 micron disc filter from the visy coolaroo mill experimental section in australia when investigating the organic load s effect on the rate and type of fouling 100 and 50 pw solutions by volume were used the solvent employed was tap water tw for 50 dilutions as the presence of ions would not have affected the uf membrane performance due to the filter s pore sizes 16 when not in use the feed was stored in a 4 c fridge spectrum rx9100 microbiocide agent was added five days after collecting the feed to prevent the degradation of the organic matter 17 the microbiocide agent composed of bronopol methylchloroisothiazolinone and methylisothiazolinone was sourced from solenis 2 2 process water and membrane characterisation cod and non purgeable dissolved organic carbon npoc of the process water both diluted and undiluted were measured using spectroquant prove 300 spectrophotometer and shimadzu toc v with tnm 1unit respectively the error bars shown in fig 10 are based on the error measurements of the equipment the spectrophotometric methods were adapted from the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 17 ph electrical conductivity ec and temperature were measured using thermoscientific orion star a325 ph conductivity portable multiparameter meter the size distribution of the particles in the water samples were measured using laser diffraction in a malvern mastersizer 2000 the target analyte was caco3 calcite with obscuration averaging 6 87 deionised di water was used as dispersant scanning electron microscope sem images of the membrane surfaces were captured using phenom xl benchtop sem for qualitative fouling analysis the images were analysed at 1000 and 2500 magnification using full backscatter electron detector and 15 kv the beam intensity was set to image with 1024 resolution energy dispersive x ray edx analyses were conducted using the built in software to identify the elements present on the membrane surfaces prior to the sem analysis the membrane samples were sputter coated with gold platinum for 15 s using quorum sc7620 sputter coater 2 3 experimental setup the membranes used were polyethersulphone synder uf flat sheet membranes mq model 50 kda mwco with 42 cm2 active surface area the membrane module was a sterlitech cf042h the experiments were conducted using the setup shown in fig 1 where pg corresponds to a manometer showing the gauge pressure each trial ran for 1 5 h prior to each run the membranes were preconditioned with di water for 30 min to establish the pure water flux baseline and remove any impurities from the membranes constant pressure mode and crossflow regime were used a new membrane was used for each experiment the feed was stored in a graduated cylinder and pumped over the membrane using a hydra cell g13 centrifugal pump the transmembrane pressure was set by manually adjusting the opening pressure of check valve v 02 the permeate was collected in a beaker placed on top of a balance which recorded the permeate mass every 60 s at the end of each experiment 40 ml permeate samples were collected for cod and npoc measurements the membranes were dried at room temperature and then stored in press seal plastic bags to be analysed by sem the retentate was continuously recycled to minimise the initial feed volume required the initial feed volume was maintained at 1 6 l the crossflow velocity averaged 1 50 m s 2 4 flux analysis the permeate flow rate was calculated by dividing the difference of consecutive weight measurements by the timestep and multiplying the results with the density of water assumed constant at 20 c 0 998 g ml the fluxes were calculated by dividing the permeate flow rate by the active surface area of the membrane these were then adjusted by standard temperature 20 c based on 18 as shown in eq 1 12 the flux reductions in percent over time were calculated using eq 2 the recovery for each experiment was calculated using eq 3 1 j s j m μ m μ s j m 1 03 t s t m 2 j s reduction j s i j s i 1 j s i 100 3 recovery permeate volume at the end of

assumed to be the same as water at 20o c 1 00 103 kg m s i corresponds to the flux recorded at time i the specific flux normalised the temperature adjusted flux by tmp this can be found in eq 4 the error bars shown in fig 6 are based on the standard deviation of the last five flux measurements for each experiment the resulting specific fluxes of each experiment were also normalised by the permeability of di water to compare the specific fluxes across different tmps this is because the permeability can be affected by membrane compaction fouling layer compaction and general resistance with increasing feed pressure this is shown in eq 5 the specific flux results were also used to determine the performance loss due to fouling depicted in eq 6 12 4 j sp j s p 5 j sp norm j sp pw j sp

flux that is being evaluated 3 model description modelling the fouling mechanisms is essential to evaluate the causes of fouling which is key in determining the ability of membrane technology to treat the process waters in paper mills fully operating with recycled fibres understanding the fouling phenomena is also critical to understanding the effect of tmp and feed organic load on the filtration process a limitation of the hermia model is that it was developed for dead end filtration mode whereas most industrial processes as well as the experiments conducted here use crossflow configuration de barros et al 19 modified hermia s model to account for this the general form for the adjusted models can be found in eq 7 all these models assume that the membrane is composed of parallel pores with constant diameters and heights 13 7 dj dt k j j ss 2 n where t is the filtration time k corresponds to the blocking law filtration coefficient the equation to calculate k differs for all four models and details are available in 19 n corresponds to the fouling mechanism 2 0 for complete blocking 1 5 for standard blocking 1 0 for intermediate blocking and 0 for cake filtration the fouling mechanisms modified by 19 are illustrated in fig 2 3 1 complete blocking model n 2 the complete blocking model assumes the entrance of the pores gets blocked due to particle retention 13 also it posits that the particles land only on the membrane not on each other the flux decline is proportional to the covered area and reaches zero when a monolayer is formed 19 the corresponding flux equation can be found in eq 8 and is depicted in fig 2a 8 j m j ss j 0 j ss e k c t 3 2 standard blocking model n 1 5 the standard blocking model accounts for the reduction of the void volume within the membrane it assumes the pore volume decreases proportionally to the volume of particles that are uniformly deposited on the pore walls 13 the corresponding flux equation can be found in eq 9 and is represented in fig 2b 9 j p 1 1 j 0 k s t 2 3 3 intermediate blocking model n 1 the intermediate blocking model is an extension of the complete blocking model it still assumes that the pore entrances are blocked but allows for particles to land on top of one another and for blocked pores to be subsequently unblocked 13 consequently the probability of a particle blocking a pore is modelled the corresponding flux equation can be found in eq 10 and is shown in fig 2c 10 j m j 0 j ss e k i j ss t j ss j 0 e k i j ss t 1 3 4 cake filtration model n 0 based on resistance in series the cake filtration model assumes that the retained particles do not affect the membrane structure 20 in other words pore blocking and constriction do not take place instead cake formation occurs on the membrane outer surface due to large particles the corresponding flux equation can be found in eq 11 and is depicted in fig 2d 11 j ss 2 k 0 t ln j p j 0 j 0 j ss j m j ss j ss 1 j m 1 j 0 4 results and discussion 4 1 feed characteristics uf membranes are known to remove organic matter and particles although fouling is often caused by these particles and other organic and biological contaminants 12 cake formation occurs due to large particles while pore blockages and pore volume reductions result from the smaller ones this study evaluated the reduction of cod with uf non purgeable organic carbon npoc was measured to corroborate the cod results cod is influenced by the high amounts of total suspended solids such as fibres and oxidisable wet end additives such as starch in the process water 10 the feed characteristics for 100 and 50 pw are shown in table 1 the cod and npoc values for 100 pw were taken over four non consecutive days the cod and npoc of a 50 pw feed sample were measured and compared with the 100 pw feed sample that was taken on the same day third of sampling because the 50 pw feed cod and npoc both averaged 53 of the original 100 pw and the cod and npoc measurements were within the error measurements of the analytical method the characteristics of the single sample was taken as representative for all 50 pw feeds the initial feed temperatures varied depending on the ambient conditions however the temperatures increased throughout all experiments due to increase in ambient room temperature the final feed temperatures at the end of the 100 and 50 pw runs averaged 22 90 c 1 28 c and 23 90 0 61 c respectively the average particle size distribution psd for 100 pw is shown in fig 3 a bimodal distribution is observed with two major peaks at 1 and 100 μm two other peaks are observed at around 50 and 400 μm but were excluded due to their low impact and significance compared to the local peaks the high concentration of larger particles suggests that fouling can easily occur 4 2 flux to determine the effect of organic load and tmp on flux experiments were conducted at 50 and 100 pw for tmps of 1 35 4 5 and 6 bar for 1 5 h the flux data were adjusted by temperature to account for the varying viscosity of the feed due to temperature changes as temperature was not controlled the resulting fluxes for 50 and 100 pw at all tmps are shown in fig 4 the flux reductions in percent were calculated to further evaluate the process behaviour as seen in fig 5 low tmp 1 35 bar resulted in lower fluxes 50 pw at 1 35 bar tmp had an initial flux of 46 l m2 h which was reduced to 32 l m2 h within the second minute and continued to decrease throughout the experiment the flux for 100 pw at the same tmp did not decrease as drastically within the first 2 min of the run and also steadily decreased throughout the experiment the 1 35 bar tmp fluxes were reduced by 42 after 90 min whereas at higher tmp flux reductions averaged over 59 although the 50 pw fluxes seem to be declining more severely compared to 100 pw towards the end of each experiment and higher tmp produced higher volumetric flux reductions fig 5 shows that all combinations of tmp and pw experienced similar percent flux reductions ranging between 5 and 10 after the first 10 min notwithstanding the steeper volumetric flux drops observed with increasing tmp are attributed to the large driving force across the membrane which may have exacerbated fouling sousa et al 14 and xu et al 15 reported similar initial flux reductions at tmps above 1 bar with feed cod levels at 252 and 733 mg l respectively they seemingly had consistent percent flux reductions likewise to the data shown in fig 5 fig 5 suggests that the feed organic load limited the allowable flux contributing more severely to fouling however fig 4 shows that tmp can be manipulated to produce higher permeate flow rates and therefore can be modified to exacerbate or limit the effects of fouling this is seen in the difference in flux reductions during the first 10 min between low and high tmp in fig 4 implying that significant and immediate fouling is mainly observed at tmps above 1 35 bar the permeate recoveries are summarised in table 2 the recoveries for both feed concentrations increased from 1 35 bar to 4 5 bar tmp after which the recoveries achieved were similar from 4 5 to 6 bar tmp the recoveries for 50 pw were consistently higher compared to 100 pw with the differences attributed to 50 pw not having as drastic initial flux reductions as seen in fig 4 50 pw 6 bar tmp did not drop as severely as 4 5 bar tmp with the same concentration within the first 30 min justifying its higher recovery the low recoveries are due to the duration of the experiments a single run with 100 pw at 4 5 bar tmp was conducted for 2 5 h although the feed volume was increased from 1 6 to 2 l the permeate recovery reached 32 further studies are required to investigate the process behaviours at longer operating times 4 3 specific flux and performance loss due to fouling to compare the process performances across different tmps and feed concentrations the specific and normalised specific fluxes based on the fluxes recorded at the 90 minute mark were calculated because the specific flux also known as permeability indicates the permeate flow rate per area per unit of pressure applied it can be used to infer the process energy requirements the permeabilities for 50 and 100 pw at all tmps are shown in fig 6 normalising the specific fluxes for both feed concentrations with di water generates the percent of permeability achieved at each tmp as shown in table 3 the specific flux for di water increased from 1 35 to 4 5 bar and decreased again after this is attributed to higher membrane resistance because of compaction which was caused by the high feed pressure in other words despite 6 bar tmp producing higher permeate flow rates see fig s1 in the supplementary information the increase in flux from 4 5 to 6 bar tmp was not high enough to match the efficiency of operating at 4 5 bar however when using 100 and 50 pw both the permeability and normalised specific flux decreased as tmp increased with both feed concentrations reaching similar values at 4 5 and 6 bar tmp 50 pw 1 35 bar tmp produced the largest specific flux significantly higher compared to 100 pw at the same tmp as seen in table 3 this suggests that 50 pw 1 35 bar was the most efficient separation process due to the low feed pressure and reduced number of particles reducing the negative effects of fouling notwithstanding 1 35 bar had a significantly higher normalised specific fluxes compared to higher tmps for both feed concentrations it can be seen that 1 35 bar tmp and 50 pw produced the highest permeabilities and normalised specific fluxes both representing the most efficient separation conditions for this process therefore 100 and 50 pw at 1 35 bar tmp were used as reference points to evaluate the performance drop when operating at higher tmps for 100 and 50 pw respectively as shown in table 4 table 5 presents the performance drop when operating with 100 pw feed using 50 pw feed as baseline the values in both tables are the averages throughout the experiments a significant increase in performance loss at higher tmp is noted in table 4 demonstrating the exacerbating effects of tmp on fouling and its resulting effect on performance because 50 pw 1 35 bar tmp was more efficient compared to 100 pw 1 35 bar tmp the performance drop was more severe when operating at higher tmp for 50 pw table 5 indicates that 100 pw 4 5 bar tmp was a relatively efficient process condition the performance drop when increasing the tmp from 1 35 bar to 4 5 bar at 100 pw was only 20 furthermore the drop in performance when operating at 100 pw versus 50 pw for 4 5 bar tmp was only 3 except for 1 35 bar tmp the performance drops listed in table 5 are considerably lower compared to table 4 these results in addition to those presented in fig 6 and table 3 show that both the tmp and feed organic load affected fouling likewise to the findings detailed in section 4 2 the feed cod limited the highest achievable process performance however tmp controlled the extent of fouling within the range specified by the feed organic load consequently tmp can be construed as the dominant factor that controls fouling as it can be manipulated to improve on or exacerbate the process performance given that fouling is inevitable due to the high number of particles in the feed reducing the feed cod from 8200 to 4100 mg l did not have as significant an impact on the process performance as changing the tmp the reduced influence of the feed organic load on the extent of fouling can be explained by 1 35 bar achieving comparable recoveries table 2 for both feed concentrations despite 50 pw leading to more efficient process conditions this is also supported by the significantly similar permeabilities and normalised specific fluxes achieved with both feed concentrations at 4 5 and 6 bar tmp these results have important implications for industrial processes as they indicate that there are trade offs between obtaining high permeate flow rates achieved at higher tmp while simultaneously minimising energy consumption and fouling achieved at lower tmp 4 4 fouling 4 4 1 model results to identify the fouling mechanisms the four adjusted fouling mechanisms developed by hermia 13 and summarised in section 3 were fitted to the flux data for 100 and 50 pw table 6 presents the coefficient of determination r2 values obtained for each blocking model an example of this fit for 100 pw at 6 bar tmp is shown in fig 7 cake formation was the dominant mechanism for all combinations of feed and tmp despite 100 pw at 4 5 bar tmp recording a slightly higher fit for intermediate blocking standard blocking and complete blocking are simplistic models as the pore volume distribution of the membranes is assumed to be uniform because the standard blocking model accounts for particle impingement and gradual pore volume reduction its predicted flux steadily decreases without plateauing as seen in fig 7b the complete blocking model is restrictive because of its monolayer assumption justifying the consistently better fit of the intermediate blocking model to the experimental results regardless of feed concentration and tmp as seen in fig 7a the flux predicted by the complete blocking model theoretically reaches steady state immediately while that predicted by the intermediate blocking model fig 7c allows for continuous small reductions after the initial flux drop the complete and standard blocking model predictions do not adequately match the experimental results shown in fig 4 wherein all fluxes were continuously reduced over time with fluxes above 1 35 bar tmp experiencing severe initial drops 50 pw at 1 35 bar tmp had lower fits for all models compared to the other process parameters this is attributed to its high normalised specific flux table 3 indicating reduced fouling the lower normalised specific flux for 100 pw 1 35 bar indicates that more severe cake formation occurred compared to 50 pw at the same tmp supported by the higher r2 fit in table 6 this was attributed to the higher feed contaminant levels 100 pw 4 5 bar tmp had high fits for the complete blocking intermediate blocking and cake formation models the high complete blocking model fit indicates that pore blockage indeed occurred for 100 pw 4 5 bar tmp but that the feed pressure was not high enough to increase the force with which the particles collided with the membrane surface achieving more stable flow this further supports the results presented in section 4 3 where 100 pw at 4 5 bar was shown to be an efficient combination of feed and process conditions notwithstanding cake formation appears to dominate as will be discussed in section 4 4 2 sousa et al 14 applied the hermia 13 cake filtration model when treating the wastewater from a recycled paper mill at tmps equal to and above 2 bar their dominant fouling mechanism was intermediate blocking due to their significantly smaller feed psd 0 1589 1 642 μm and cod levels 252 mg l the standard blocking model had a low fit to their data implying that the model poorly predicts the fouling behaviour for feeds with multiple contaminants and non uniform psd the results of 14 agree with our findings their smaller psd contributed more to pore blockage whereas the larger and bimodal psd of our process water fig 3 appears to result in a combination of pore blockage smaller particles and cake formation larger particles with the latter occurring more intensely due to the higher number of larger particles consequently the feed psd and organic load dictate the type and extent of each fouling mechanism while the severity of fouling is attributed more highly to tmp it is worth noting that in this study the 50 pw already contained high organic concentrations 4000 mg l cod therefore all membranes experienced cake formation although 50 pw was less intense the feed organic load would have to be as low as those explored by 14 to reduce the occurrence of cake formation our conclusion is supported by the fact that 14 did not get adequate fits for any model at tmps below 2 bar as the low pressure did not induce fouling as severely as higher tmps likewise in this study 1 35 bar tmp had lower r2 fits for all models for 50 and 100 pw these conclusions corroborate the findings detailed in section 4 3 in our process the feed organic load limited the achievable specific flux due the high number of particles both small and large contributing to pore blockage and cake formation however the tmp dictated the severity and extent of the fouling mechanisms controlling the process performance ultimately the process can be characterised by a mixture of layered pore blockages and dominant cake formation for all combinations of feed organic load and tmp 4 4 2 morphology sem images of the uf membranes following use with di water and pw at different feed concentrations and tmp are shown in fig 8 di water fig 8a was used as reference to enable the degree of fouling for the other membranes to be visually evaluated the pores of the membrane exposed to di water were clear and numerous and the membrane surface was smooth the sem images for 100 pw 1 35 and 4 5 bar tmp at higher magnification are shown in fig 9 to further visualise the increased occurrence of fouling at higher tmp the surface of the membrane exposed to 100 pw at 1 35 bar is significantly less smooth compared to the membrane operated solely with di water however the number of unblocked pores remains quite high in fig 8b suggesting that fouling was not as severe as the membranes operated at higher tmps fig 8c f the rough surface is attributed to cake formation edx indicated the presence of sodium and calcium on the pw based membrane surfaces while the di water membrane surfaces had none see figs s2 and s3 100 pw at 4 5 bar tmp fig 8c appears to be slightly more fouled compared to 50 pw at the same tmp fig 8d due to its surface being less smooth with increased calcium rich blocked pores bright circles as seen in figs 8c and s4 this is justified as 50 pw 4 5 bar was only slightly more efficient compared to 100 pw at the same tmp table 5 the fewer blocked pores and areas with smoother surface in fig 8d indicates reduced cake formation these observations support the r2 data shown in table 6 nevertheless the difference in fouling phenomena and intensity from 1 35 to 4 5 bar tmp 100 pw is clear from fig 9 with a rougher surface and blocked pores observed in fig 9b 100 and 50 pw at 6 bar tmp fig 8e and f show clear signs of cake formation with moderate pore blockages this explains why both feed concentrations at 6 bar tmp are good fits for the hermia intermediate blocking and cake formation models as increased cake formation at higher contaminant concentrations and tmp increased the probability of pore blockage which is modelled by intermediate blocking the similarity in the visual extent of fouling supports the findings detailed in section 4 3 that the high feed pressure of 6 bar forced the particles onto the membrane exacerbating fouling which was not as severe for 4 5 bar tmp for both feed concentrations xu et al 15 investigated the effect of coagulation and fenton pre treatment on the performance of uf in treating the secondary effluent from a recycled paper mill they did not fit their flux data to the hermia 13 model however with feed cod loads amounting to 733 mg l the sem images of their membrane surfaces were relatively smooth with only moderate signs of pore blockage and cake formation this supports the hypothesis that the fouling type is more heavily influenced by the feed psd in addition sem analysis corroborates the findings that pore blockage and cake formation occurred regardless of the pw and tmp used visually comparing the membranes supports the hypothesis that tmp controls the severity with which fouling occurred and its resulting effect on the process performance these also support our previous findings of increased fouling with increasing tmp ultrafiltration in flat sheet membranes is traditionally characterised by high initial fluxes followed by immediate and drastic fouling after which steady state flow rapidly occurs as demonstrated by 21 in this study high initial fluxes were achieved within the first minute of each experiment these were followed by drastic flux reductions during the succeeding 9 min figs 4 and 5 attributed to pore blockage and cake formation then cake filtration was achieved characterised by the consistent low percent flux reductions the divergence is attributed to the difference in feed characteristics as 21 used dilute suspensions of polystyrene particles compared to this study s highly concentrated pw characterised by high cod levels large particles and a large psd 4 5 separation performance to determine the effect of organic load and tmp on organic separation the cod and npoc of the permeates were analysed for 50 and 100 pw at all tmps and compared with their original feed organic loads fig 10 a and b shows the cod and npoc concentrations for 50 and 100 pw permeates at different tmps fig 9c and d highlights the percent reductions of cod and npoc in the permeate from their original feed concentrations the same trends are observed for both cod and npoc permeate measurements although a pattern is observed for the 50 pw permeate organic loads the values are within the experimental error therefore it can be concluded that at 50 pw concentration the percent organic load reduction is almost identical across all tmps conversely for 100 pw permeates the organic load increased with from 1 35 to 4 5 bar and decreased again as tmp increased further the differing organic removal trends are due to the increased cake formation at 100 pw attributed to the higher number of particles in the feed this explains the increased cod removal at 6 bar tmp for 100 pw as the higher feed pressure forced the water through the cake simultaneously causing more severe cake formation while rejecting cod as discussed in section 4 4 2 fig 8e and f on the other hand low tmp 1 35 bar produced high organic removal for 100 pw attributed to the lower pressure which reduced the severity with which particles interfered with each other on the membrane surface resulting in more efficient organic separation the uniform organic removal for 50 pw fig 9c is attributed to the reduced particle interference on the membrane surfaces reducing the resistance with which water was filtered through the membrane this indicates that at half the organic load both the specific flux fig 6 and contaminant reduction are similar at high tmp 4 5 to 6 bar sousa et al 2018 14 and xu et al 2018 15 both investigated the cod separation in their processes although their membrane mwcos were 10 and 5 kda their cod removal amounted to 54 and 48 respectively conversely the highest cod separation achieved in the current study was 47 this suggests that high quality separation can be achieved if uf is operated in series as despite the large disparity in feed organic concentration the removal efficiency is high filtration can be further improved if backwashing is implemented as cake formation is reversible these are key factors that need to be investigated in future studies as their influence on the process conditions and separation capabilities are critical in implementing a water treatment scheme to close the water system loop in paper mills operating with recycled fibres 5 conclusion despite the success of closed loops in paper mills operating with virgin fibres limited information exists on the performance of uf in mills operating with 100 rcf and restricted water systems as these result in the accumulation of insoluble contaminants in the effluent straining the water treatment process this study investigated the effects of transmembrane pressure and organic load on the flux types of fouling and organic separation capabilities in a recycled paper mill using 100 rcf the flux reductions consistently ranged from 5 to 10 after the first 10 min of each experiment the performance drop when operating at higher tmp reached 52 6 bar tmp 50 pw whereas doubling the feed cod from 4100 mg l to 8200 mg l only reached up to 20 drop in performance 1 35 bar tmp 100 pw for 100 pw low tmp 1 35 bar produced the highest specific flux 13 l m2 h bar and cod reduction 47 whereas higher tmp produced higher permeate flow rates with 4 5 bar tmp generating a moderately efficient process while 4 5 to 6 bar seemed to optimise the flux and recovery for this process low tmp appears to be the more sensible option for industry especially since high cod removal can potentially be achieved if uf is operated in series the process was characterised by high initial fluxes followed by rapid fouling due to cake formation which dominated and pore blockage the excess cake formation induced cake filtration the high feed organic load and particle size distribution caused inevitable fouling controlling the degree with which each fouling mechanism occurred and limited the highest achievable process performance however tmp dictated the severity of fouling and its resulting effect on the flux and organic removal within the range specified as a result of the feed characteristics this study demonstrates the potential for uf as a pre treatment method for process water in a recycled paper mill using 100 rcf a critical step in implementing the kidney strategy and achieving water system closure for these challenging

13309,the use of membranes in integrated water systems has garnered increasing attention in paper mills operating with virgin fibres with documented closed water loops in industry however limited research exists on the performance of ultrafiltration uf in mills operating with 100 recycled fibres rcf and closed water systems as these result in the introduction and accumulation of insoluble contaminants in the effluent this study investigated the effect of transmembrane pressure tmp and feed organic load on the flux types of fouling and organic separation with uf membranes in a recycled paper mill using 100 rcf the high feed organic load caused inevitable fouling limiting the highest achievable flux however the tmp could be manipulated to improve on or exacerbate the process performance within the range that was set as a result of the feed s characteristics low tmp 1 35 bar generated the highest permeability and chemical oxygen demand removal while higher tmps produced higher fluxes and recoveries the process was characterised by high initial fluxes followed by cake formation which dominated and pore blockage the excess cake formation induced cake filtration this study shows the potential of uf membranes to be used as pre treatment in filtering the process water in a recycled paper mill operating with 100 rcf a critical step forward in implementing an integrated water system and eventually closing the water loop graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ultrafiltration recycled paper mill cod cake formation water system closure 1 introduction papermaking requires large quantities of virgin fibres and water 1 as a result global trends such as the overexploitation and growing scarcity of natural resources continue to exert additional stress on the pulp and paper industry in order to address this two different approaches widely investigated include re pulping of recycled fibres rcf and water system closure by recycling water streams 2 the former has been reported to minimise waste generation and decrease pulping costs 3 however the introduction of rcf adds non fibrous and insoluble contaminants while system closure results in the accumulation of dissolved and colloidal materials impeding the pulping process 4 consequently there is a need to design efficient water treatment schemes to allow the streams to be fully reused for a sustainable closed loop water system clws one method gathering increasing attention is membrane filtration which was first investigated in the pulp and paper industry in the late 1960s 5 over time membrane technology has proven to be a flexible and efficient treatment process for treating and reusing wastewater streams due to the reduced variation in the quality of the effluents and the simple automation of the processes 6 many studies have analysed the performance of membrane systems to treat water streams from virgin fibre production zhang et al 7 investigated black liquor pulp bleaching effluent and paper machine white water pmww treatment in an integrated membrane process this comprised physical and chemical pre treatments followed by a membrane bioreactor mbr microfiltration mf and reverse osmosis ro they noted that the mbr separated the majority of the soluble organic substances and suspended solids ultimately achieving 60 recovery at the ro stage with acceptable permeate quality for mill reuse richardson et al 8 studied the feasibility of removing inorganic salts from pmww to produce effluents acceptable for irrigation using a multi stage mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf and ro pilot plant however they found that nf was unable to separate acceptable levels of sodium ions resulting in excessive fouling at the ro stage in addition fouling was exacerbated by scaling in the ro membranes due to bicarbonate precipitation the mckinley mill in new mexico has been operating with zero effluent discharge since 1994 9 their system comprises a disc screen and cyclic activated sludge system as pre treatment followed by uf and ro and an evaporative crystalliser their success lies in integrating their water treatment scheme into the paper mill s operational design for instance part of the uf membrane permeate is recycled into the mill s process water pw instead of the entire filtrate being sent to the ro membrane the mckinley mill demonstrates the importance of implementing the kidney approach in closing the water loop this strategy focuses on directly treating and recycling internal effluents to reduce the operational strain of treating the end of pipe wastewater stream 10 while success has been achieved for virgin fibre mills there is limited research on the performance of membrane systems in mills using a fraction of recycled fibres negaresh 2 investigated nf as a pre treatment to ro in a plant operating with 0 to 50 recycled newsprint fibre they concluded that sodium and silica severely affected the performance of the membrane achieving only 22 water recovery at the ro stage at 50 rcf richardson et al 11 treated 40 rcf filtrate using a three stage uf nf and ro pilot plant noting that fouling at the nf stage prevented the implementation of such system eventually the pilot plant was decomissioned as excessive fouling could not be controlled due to the lack of process optimisation particularly they were unable to reduce the chemical oxygen demand cod to acceptable levels prior to the nf stage which could have potentially been achieved with sufficient pre treatment as observed in the mckinley mill so far there have been no published investigations on the performance of uf in mills operating with 100 rcf and restricted water systems as the majority of industrial uf membranes employed in the pulp and paper industry are used to recover coating colours and to treat pmww 5 since uf is the most widely used and established membrane process in the pulp and paper industry and therefore has considerable existing infrastructure and associated operational knowledge it seems sensible to explore its potential for broader applications including clwss in recycled paper mills one of the major hindrances to the implementation of membrane technology in any industry is membrane fouling 5 a challenge also identified for membrane filtration of rcf 11 as the permeate flow is inherently governed by fouling 12 four fouling mechanism models for ultrafiltration membranes were developed by hermia 13 complete blocking intermediate blocking standard blocking and cake layer formation the causes for the fouling phenomena can be inferred by analysing the effects of transmembrane pressure tmp and feed organic load on the fouling type and flux little research exists on the applications of these models in mills using rcf sousa et al 14 applied them however their feed was sourced from the wastewater treatment plant of the recycled paper mill reducing the concentration of contaminants they concluded that the mechanism controlling fouling was intermediate blocking xu et al 15 investigated fouling mechanisms in a recycled paper mill however their focus was on the performance of using upstream coagulation and fenton pre treatment prior to uf ultimately with the success of closed loops in mills operating with virgin fibres there is high potential to achieve system closure in recycled paper mills when using the kidney approach in addition there is a lack of knowledge on the fouling modes for ultrafiltration membranes in such mills as well as the pw characteristics this inhibits the development of sustainable effluent management and water closure systems as observed in the decommissioned pilot plant by 11 uf systems are pressure driven processes and rcf effluents are characterised by high cod which may vary drastically from day to day due to the heterogeneous nature of the recycled feed this study therefore investigated the effects of tmp and organic load on the fouling mechanisms in uf membranes when treating the pw from a recycled paper mill operating with 100 rcf the resulting flux and quality of the permeate were also investigated as a result a critical foundation was determined for the potential use of ultrafiltration membrane technology as pre treatment using the kidney approach by evaluating uf s performance in filtering the process water in mills fully operating with rcf this study provides a critical step forward in integrating a complete water treatment scheme and eventually closing the loop towards cleaner production 2 materials and methods 2 1 recycled paper mill process water the feed was taken from a clarifier with a 20 micron disc filter from the visy coolaroo mill experimental section in australia when investigating the organic load s effect on the rate and type of fouling 100 and 50 pw solutions by volume were used the solvent employed was tap water tw for 50 dilutions as the presence of ions would not have affected the uf membrane performance due to the filter s pore sizes 16 when not in use the feed was stored in a 4 c fridge spectrum rx9100 microbiocide agent was added five days after collecting the feed to prevent the degradation of the organic matter 17 the microbiocide agent composed of bronopol methylchloroisothiazolinone and methylisothiazolinone was sourced from solenis 2 2 process water and membrane characterisation cod and non purgeable dissolved organic carbon npoc of the process water both diluted and undiluted were measured using spectroquant prove 300 spectrophotometer and shimadzu toc v with tnm 1unit respectively the error bars shown in fig 10 are based on the error measurements of the equipment the spectrophotometric methods were adapted from the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 17 ph electrical conductivity ec and temperature were measured using thermoscientific orion star a325 ph conductivity portable multiparameter meter the size distribution of the particles in the water samples were measured using laser diffraction in a malvern mastersizer 2000 the target analyte was caco3 calcite with obscuration averaging 6 87 deionised di water was used as dispersant scanning electron microscope sem images of the membrane surfaces were captured using phenom xl benchtop sem for qualitative fouling analysis the images were analysed at 1000 and 2500 magnification using full backscatter electron detector and 15 kv the beam intensity was set to image with 1024 resolution energy dispersive x ray edx analyses were conducted using the built in software to identify the elements present on the membrane surfaces prior to the sem analysis the membrane samples were sputter coated with gold platinum for 15 s using quorum sc7620 sputter coater 2 3 experimental setup the membranes used were polyethersulphone synder uf flat sheet membranes mq model 50 kda mwco with 42 cm2 active surface area the membrane module was a sterlitech cf042h the experiments were conducted using the setup shown in fig 1 where pg corresponds to a manometer showing the gauge pressure each trial ran for 1 5 h prior to each run the membranes were preconditioned with di water for 30 min to establish the pure water flux baseline and remove any impurities from the membranes constant pressure mode and crossflow regime were used a new membrane was used for each experiment the feed was stored in a graduated cylinder and pumped over the membrane using a hydra cell g13 centrifugal pump the transmembrane pressure was set by manually adjusting the opening pressure of check valve v 02 the permeate was collected in a beaker placed on top of a balance which recorded the permeate mass every 60 s at the end of each experiment 40 ml permeate samples were collected for cod and npoc measurements the membranes were dried at room temperature and then stored in press seal plastic bags to be analysed by sem the retentate was continuously recycled to minimise the initial feed volume required the initial feed volume was maintained at 1 6 l the crossflow velocity averaged 1 50 m s 2 4 flux analysis the permeate flow rate was calculated by dividing the difference of consecutive weight measurements by the timestep and multiplying the results with the density of water assumed constant at 20 c 0 998 g ml the fluxes were calculated by dividing the permeate flow rate by the active surface area of the membrane these were then adjusted by standard temperature 20 c based on 18 as shown in eq 1 12 the flux reductions in percent over time were calculated using eq 2 the recovery for each experiment was calculated using eq 3 1 j s j m μ m μ s j m 1 03 t s t m 2 j s reduction j s i j s i 1 j s i 100 3 recovery permeate volume at the end of

assumed to be the same as water at 20o c 1 00 103 kg m s i corresponds to the flux recorded at time i the specific flux normalised the temperature adjusted flux by tmp this can be found in eq 4 the error bars shown in fig 6 are based on the standard deviation of the last five flux measurements for each experiment the resulting specific fluxes of each experiment were also normalised by the permeability of di water to compare the specific fluxes across different tmps this is because the permeability can be affected by membrane compaction fouling layer compaction and general resistance with increasing feed pressure this is shown in eq 5 the specific flux results were also used to determine the performance loss due to fouling depicted in eq 6 12 4 j sp j s p 5 j sp norm j sp pw j sp

flux that is being evaluated 3 model description modelling the fouling mechanisms is essential to evaluate the causes of fouling which is key in determining the ability of membrane technology to treat the process waters in paper mills fully operating with recycled fibres understanding the fouling phenomena is also critical to understanding the effect of tmp and feed organic load on the filtration process a limitation of the hermia model is that it was developed for dead end filtration mode whereas most industrial processes as well as the experiments conducted here use crossflow configuration de barros et al 19 modified hermia s model to account for this the general form for the adjusted models can be found in eq 7 all these models assume that the membrane is composed of parallel pores with constant diameters and heights 13 7 dj dt k j j ss 2 n where t is the filtration time k corresponds to the blocking law filtration coefficient the equation to calculate k differs for all four models and details are available in 19 n corresponds to the fouling mechanism 2 0 for complete blocking 1 5 for standard blocking 1 0 for intermediate blocking and 0 for cake filtration the fouling mechanisms modified by 19 are illustrated in fig 2 3 1 complete blocking model n 2 the complete blocking model assumes the entrance of the pores gets blocked due to particle retention 13 also it posits that the particles land only on the membrane not on each other the flux decline is proportional to the covered area and reaches zero when a monolayer is formed 19 the corresponding flux equation can be found in eq 8 and is depicted in fig 2a 8 j m j ss j 0 j ss e k c t 3 2 standard blocking model n 1 5 the standard blocking model accounts for the reduction of the void volume within the membrane it assumes the pore volume decreases proportionally to the volume of particles that are uniformly deposited on the pore walls 13 the corresponding flux equation can be found in eq 9 and is represented in fig 2b 9 j p 1 1 j 0 k s t 2 3 3 intermediate blocking model n 1 the intermediate blocking model is an extension of the complete blocking model it still assumes that the pore entrances are blocked but allows for particles to land on top of one another and for blocked pores to be subsequently unblocked 13 consequently the probability of a particle blocking a pore is modelled the corresponding flux equation can be found in eq 10 and is shown in fig 2c 10 j m j 0 j ss e k i j ss t j ss j 0 e k i j ss t 1 3 4 cake filtration model n 0 based on resistance in series the cake filtration model assumes that the retained particles do not affect the membrane structure 20 in other words pore blocking and constriction do not take place instead cake formation occurs on the membrane outer surface due to large particles the corresponding flux equation can be found in eq 11 and is depicted in fig 2d 11 j ss 2 k 0 t ln j p j 0 j 0 j ss j m j ss j ss 1 j m 1 j 0 4 results and discussion 4 1 feed characteristics uf membranes are known to remove organic matter and particles although fouling is often caused by these particles and other organic and biological contaminants 12 cake formation occurs due to large particles while pore blockages and pore volume reductions result from the smaller ones this study evaluated the reduction of cod with uf non purgeable organic carbon npoc was measured to corroborate the cod results cod is influenced by the high amounts of total suspended solids such as fibres and oxidisable wet end additives such as starch in the process water 10 the feed characteristics for 100 and 50 pw are shown in table 1 the cod and npoc values for 100 pw were taken over four non consecutive days the cod and npoc of a 50 pw feed sample were measured and compared with the 100 pw feed sample that was taken on the same day third of sampling because the 50 pw feed cod and npoc both averaged 53 of the original 100 pw and the cod and npoc measurements were within the error measurements of the analytical method the characteristics of the single sample was taken as representative for all 50 pw feeds the initial feed temperatures varied depending on the ambient conditions however the temperatures increased throughout all experiments due to increase in ambient room temperature the final feed temperatures at the end of the 100 and 50 pw runs averaged 22 90 c 1 28 c and 23 90 0 61 c respectively the average particle size distribution psd for 100 pw is shown in fig 3 a bimodal distribution is observed with two major peaks at 1 and 100 μm two other peaks are observed at around 50 and 400 μm but were excluded due to their low impact and significance compared to the local peaks the high concentration of larger particles suggests that fouling can easily occur 4 2 flux to determine the effect of organic load and tmp on flux experiments were conducted at 50 and 100 pw for tmps of 1 35 4 5 and 6 bar for 1 5 h the flux data were adjusted by temperature to account for the varying viscosity of the feed due to temperature changes as temperature was not controlled the resulting fluxes for 50 and 100 pw at all tmps are shown in fig 4 the flux reductions in percent were calculated to further evaluate the process behaviour as seen in fig 5 low tmp 1 35 bar resulted in lower fluxes 50 pw at 1 35 bar tmp had an initial flux of 46 l m2 h which was reduced to 32 l m2 h within the second minute and continued to decrease throughout the experiment the flux for 100 pw at the same tmp did not decrease as drastically within the first 2 min of the run and also steadily decreased throughout the experiment the 1 35 bar tmp fluxes were reduced by 42 after 90 min whereas at higher tmp flux reductions averaged over 59 although the 50 pw fluxes seem to be declining more severely compared to 100 pw towards the end of each experiment and higher tmp produced higher volumetric flux reductions fig 5 shows that all combinations of tmp and pw experienced similar percent flux reductions ranging between 5 and 10 after the first 10 min notwithstanding the steeper volumetric flux drops observed with increasing tmp are attributed to the large driving force across the membrane which may have exacerbated fouling sousa et al 14 and xu et al 15 reported similar initial flux reductions at tmps above 1 bar with feed cod levels at 252 and 733 mg l respectively they seemingly had consistent percent flux reductions likewise to the data shown in fig 5 fig 5 suggests that the feed organic load limited the allowable flux contributing more severely to fouling however fig 4 shows that tmp can be manipulated to produce higher permeate flow rates and therefore can be modified to exacerbate or limit the effects of fouling this is seen in the difference in flux reductions during the first 10 min between low and high tmp in fig 4 implying that significant and immediate fouling is mainly observed at tmps above 1 35 bar the permeate recoveries are summarised in table 2 the recoveries for both feed concentrations increased from 1 35 bar to 4 5 bar tmp after which the recoveries achieved were similar from 4 5 to 6 bar tmp the recoveries for 50 pw were consistently higher compared to 100 pw with the differences attributed to 50 pw not having as drastic initial flux reductions as seen in fig 4 50 pw 6 bar tmp did not drop as severely as 4 5 bar tmp with the same concentration within the first 30 min justifying its higher recovery the low recoveries are due to the duration of the experiments a single run with 100 pw at 4 5 bar tmp was conducted for 2 5 h although the feed volume was increased from 1 6 to 2 l the permeate recovery reached 32 further studies are required to investigate the process behaviours at longer operating times 4 3 specific flux and performance loss due to fouling to compare the process performances across different tmps and feed concentrations the specific and normalised specific fluxes based on the fluxes recorded at the 90 minute mark were calculated because the specific flux also known as permeability indicates the permeate flow rate per area per unit of pressure applied it can be used to infer the process energy requirements the permeabilities for 50 and 100 pw at all tmps are shown in fig 6 normalising the specific fluxes for both feed concentrations with di water generates the percent of permeability achieved at each tmp as shown in table 3 the specific flux for di water increased from 1 35 to 4 5 bar and decreased again after this is attributed to higher membrane resistance because of compaction which was caused by the high feed pressure in other words despite 6 bar tmp producing higher permeate flow rates see fig s1 in the supplementary information the increase in flux from 4 5 to 6 bar tmp was not high enough to match the efficiency of operating at 4 5 bar however when using 100 and 50 pw both the permeability and normalised specific flux decreased as tmp increased with both feed concentrations reaching similar values at 4 5 and 6 bar tmp 50 pw 1 35 bar tmp produced the largest specific flux significantly higher compared to 100 pw at the same tmp as seen in table 3 this suggests that 50 pw 1 35 bar was the most efficient separation process due to the low feed pressure and reduced number of particles reducing the negative effects of fouling notwithstanding 1 35 bar had a significantly higher normalised specific fluxes compared to higher tmps for both feed concentrations it can be seen that 1 35 bar tmp and 50 pw produced the highest permeabilities and normalised specific fluxes both representing the most efficient separation conditions for this process therefore 100 and 50 pw at 1 35 bar tmp were used as reference points to evaluate the performance drop when operating at higher tmps for 100 and 50 pw respectively as shown in table 4 table 5 presents the performance drop when operating with 100 pw feed using 50 pw feed as baseline the values in both tables are the averages throughout the experiments a significant increase in performance loss at higher tmp is noted in table 4 demonstrating the exacerbating effects of tmp on fouling and its resulting effect on performance because 50 pw 1 35 bar tmp was more efficient compared to 100 pw 1 35 bar tmp the performance drop was more severe when operating at higher tmp for 50 pw table 5 indicates that 100 pw 4 5 bar tmp was a relatively efficient process condition the performance drop when increasing the tmp from 1 35 bar to 4 5 bar at 100 pw was only 20 furthermore the drop in performance when operating at 100 pw versus 50 pw for 4 5 bar tmp was only 3 except for 1 35 bar tmp the performance drops listed in table 5 are considerably lower compared to table 4 these results in addition to those presented in fig 6 and table 3 show that both the tmp and feed organic load affected fouling likewise to the findings detailed in section 4 2 the feed cod limited the highest achievable process performance however tmp controlled the extent of fouling within the range specified by the feed organic load consequently tmp can be construed as the dominant factor that controls fouling as it can be manipulated to improve on or exacerbate the process performance given that fouling is inevitable due to the high number of particles in the feed reducing the feed cod from 8200 to 4100 mg l did not have as significant an impact on the process performance as changing the tmp the reduced influence of the feed organic load on the extent of fouling can be explained by 1 35 bar achieving comparable recoveries table 2 for both feed concentrations despite 50 pw leading to more efficient process conditions this is also supported by the significantly similar permeabilities and normalised specific fluxes achieved with both feed concentrations at 4 5 and 6 bar tmp these results have important implications for industrial processes as they indicate that there are trade offs between obtaining high permeate flow rates achieved at higher tmp while simultaneously minimising energy consumption and fouling achieved at lower tmp 4 4 fouling 4 4 1 model results to identify the fouling mechanisms the four adjusted fouling mechanisms developed by hermia 13 and summarised in section 3 were fitted to the flux data for 100 and 50 pw table 6 presents the coefficient of determination r2 values obtained for each blocking model an example of this fit for 100 pw at 6 bar tmp is shown in fig 7 cake formation was the dominant mechanism for all combinations of feed and tmp despite 100 pw at 4 5 bar tmp recording a slightly higher fit for intermediate blocking standard blocking and complete blocking are simplistic models as the pore volume distribution of the membranes is assumed to be uniform because the standard blocking model accounts for particle impingement and gradual pore volume reduction its predicted flux steadily decreases without plateauing as seen in fig 7b the complete blocking model is restrictive because of its monolayer assumption justifying the consistently better fit of the intermediate blocking model to the experimental results regardless of feed concentration and tmp as seen in fig 7a the flux predicted by the complete blocking model theoretically reaches steady state immediately while that predicted by the intermediate blocking model fig 7c allows for continuous small reductions after the initial flux drop the complete and standard blocking model predictions do not adequately match the experimental results shown in fig 4 wherein all fluxes were continuously reduced over time with fluxes above 1 35 bar tmp experiencing severe initial drops 50 pw at 1 35 bar tmp had lower fits for all models compared to the other process parameters this is attributed to its high normalised specific flux table 3 indicating reduced fouling the lower normalised specific flux for 100 pw 1 35 bar indicates that more severe cake formation occurred compared to 50 pw at the same tmp supported by the higher r2 fit in table 6 this was attributed to the higher feed contaminant levels 100 pw 4 5 bar tmp had high fits for the complete blocking intermediate blocking and cake formation models the high complete blocking model fit indicates that pore blockage indeed occurred for 100 pw 4 5 bar tmp but that the feed pressure was not high enough to increase the force with which the particles collided with the membrane surface achieving more stable flow this further supports the results presented in section 4 3 where 100 pw at 4 5 bar was shown to be an efficient combination of feed and process conditions notwithstanding cake formation appears to dominate as will be discussed in section 4 4 2 sousa et al 14 applied the hermia 13 cake filtration model when treating the wastewater from a recycled paper mill at tmps equal to and above 2 bar their dominant fouling mechanism was intermediate blocking due to their significantly smaller feed psd 0 1589 1 642 μm and cod levels 252 mg l the standard blocking model had a low fit to their data implying that the model poorly predicts the fouling behaviour for feeds with multiple contaminants and non uniform psd the results of 14 agree with our findings their smaller psd contributed more to pore blockage whereas the larger and bimodal psd of our process water fig 3 appears to result in a combination of pore blockage smaller particles and cake formation larger particles with the latter occurring more intensely due to the higher number of larger particles consequently the feed psd and organic load dictate the type and extent of each fouling mechanism while the severity of fouling is attributed more highly to tmp it is worth noting that in this study the 50 pw already contained high organic concentrations 4000 mg l cod therefore all membranes experienced cake formation although 50 pw was less intense the feed organic load would have to be as low as those explored by 14 to reduce the occurrence of cake formation our conclusion is supported by the fact that 14 did not get adequate fits for any model at tmps below 2 bar as the low pressure did not induce fouling as severely as higher tmps likewise in this study 1 35 bar tmp had lower r2 fits for all models for 50 and 100 pw these conclusions corroborate the findings detailed in section 4 3 in our process the feed organic load limited the achievable specific flux due the high number of particles both small and large contributing to pore blockage and cake formation however the tmp dictated the severity and extent of the fouling mechanisms controlling the process performance ultimately the process can be characterised by a mixture of layered pore blockages and dominant cake formation for all combinations of feed organic load and tmp 4 4 2 morphology sem images of the uf membranes following use with di water and pw at different feed concentrations and tmp are shown in fig 8 di water fig 8a was used as reference to enable the degree of fouling for the other membranes to be visually evaluated the pores of the membrane exposed to di water were clear and numerous and the membrane surface was smooth the sem images for 100 pw 1 35 and 4 5 bar tmp at higher magnification are shown in fig 9 to further visualise the increased occurrence of fouling at higher tmp the surface of the membrane exposed to 100 pw at 1 35 bar is significantly less smooth compared to the membrane operated solely with di water however the number of unblocked pores remains quite high in fig 8b suggesting that fouling was not as severe as the membranes operated at higher tmps fig 8c f the rough surface is attributed to cake formation edx indicated the presence of sodium and calcium on the pw based membrane surfaces while the di water membrane surfaces had none see figs s2 and s3 100 pw at 4 5 bar tmp fig 8c appears to be slightly more fouled compared to 50 pw at the same tmp fig 8d due to its surface being less smooth with increased calcium rich blocked pores bright circles as seen in figs 8c and s4 this is justified as 50 pw 4 5 bar was only slightly more efficient compared to 100 pw at the same tmp table 5 the fewer blocked pores and areas with smoother surface in fig 8d indicates reduced cake formation these observations support the r2 data shown in table 6 nevertheless the difference in fouling phenomena and intensity from 1 35 to 4 5 bar tmp 100 pw is clear from fig 9 with a rougher surface and blocked pores observed in fig 9b 100 and 50 pw at 6 bar tmp fig 8e and f show clear signs of cake formation with moderate pore blockages this explains why both feed concentrations at 6 bar tmp are good fits for the hermia intermediate blocking and cake formation models as increased cake formation at higher contaminant concentrations and tmp increased the probability of pore blockage which is modelled by intermediate blocking the similarity in the visual extent of fouling supports the findings detailed in section 4 3 that the high feed pressure of 6 bar forced the particles onto the membrane exacerbating fouling which was not as severe for 4 5 bar tmp for both feed concentrations xu et al 15 investigated the effect of coagulation and fenton pre treatment on the performance of uf in treating the secondary effluent from a recycled paper mill they did not fit their flux data to the hermia 13 model however with feed cod loads amounting to 733 mg l the sem images of their membrane surfaces were relatively smooth with only moderate signs of pore blockage and cake formation this supports the hypothesis that the fouling type is more heavily influenced by the feed psd in addition sem analysis corroborates the findings that pore blockage and cake formation occurred regardless of the pw and tmp used visually comparing the membranes supports the hypothesis that tmp controls the severity with which fouling occurred and its resulting effect on the process performance these also support our previous findings of increased fouling with increasing tmp ultrafiltration in flat sheet membranes is traditionally characterised by high initial fluxes followed by immediate and drastic fouling after which steady state flow rapidly occurs as demonstrated by 21 in this study high initial fluxes were achieved within the first minute of each experiment these were followed by drastic flux reductions during the succeeding 9 min figs 4 and 5 attributed to pore blockage and cake formation then cake filtration was achieved characterised by the consistent low percent flux reductions the divergence is attributed to the difference in feed characteristics as 21 used dilute suspensions of polystyrene particles compared to this study s highly concentrated pw characterised by high cod levels large particles and a large psd 4 5 separation performance to determine the effect of organic load and tmp on organic separation the cod and npoc of the permeates were analysed for 50 and 100 pw at all tmps and compared with their original feed organic loads fig 10 a and b shows the cod and npoc concentrations for 50 and 100 pw permeates at different tmps fig 9c and d highlights the percent reductions of cod and npoc in the permeate from their original feed concentrations the same trends are observed for both cod and npoc permeate measurements although a pattern is observed for the 50 pw permeate organic loads the values are within the experimental error therefore it can be concluded that at 50 pw concentration the percent organic load reduction is almost identical across all tmps conversely for 100 pw permeates the organic load increased with from 1 35 to 4 5 bar and decreased again as tmp increased further the differing organic removal trends are due to the increased cake formation at 100 pw attributed to the higher number of particles in the feed this explains the increased cod removal at 6 bar tmp for 100 pw as the higher feed pressure forced the water through the cake simultaneously causing more severe cake formation while rejecting cod as discussed in section 4 4 2 fig 8e and f on the other hand low tmp 1 35 bar produced high organic removal for 100 pw attributed to the lower pressure which reduced the severity with which particles interfered with each other on the membrane surface resulting in more efficient organic separation the uniform organic removal for 50 pw fig 9c is attributed to the reduced particle interference on the membrane surfaces reducing the resistance with which water was filtered through the membrane this indicates that at half the organic load both the specific flux fig 6 and contaminant reduction are similar at high tmp 4 5 to 6 bar sousa et al 2018 14 and xu et al 2018 15 both investigated the cod separation in their processes although their membrane mwcos were 10 and 5 kda their cod removal amounted to 54 and 48 respectively conversely the highest cod separation achieved in the current study was 47 this suggests that high quality separation can be achieved if uf is operated in series as despite the large disparity in feed organic concentration the removal efficiency is high filtration can be further improved if backwashing is implemented as cake formation is reversible these are key factors that need to be investigated in future studies as their influence on the process conditions and separation capabilities are critical in implementing a water treatment scheme to close the water system loop in paper mills operating with recycled fibres 5 conclusion despite the success of closed loops in paper mills operating with virgin fibres limited information exists on the performance of uf in mills operating with 100 rcf and restricted water systems as these result in the accumulation of insoluble contaminants in the effluent straining the water treatment process this study investigated the effects of transmembrane pressure and organic load on the flux types of fouling and organic separation capabilities in a recycled paper mill using 100 rcf the flux reductions consistently ranged from 5 to 10 after the first 10 min of each experiment the performance drop when operating at higher tmp reached 52 6 bar tmp 50 pw whereas doubling the feed cod from 4100 mg l to 8200 mg l only reached up to 20 drop in performance 1 35 bar tmp 100 pw for 100 pw low tmp 1 35 bar produced the highest specific flux 13 l m2 h bar and cod reduction 47 whereas higher tmp produced higher permeate flow rates with 4 5 bar tmp generating a moderately efficient process while 4 5 to 6 bar seemed to optimise the flux and recovery for this process low tmp appears to be the more sensible option for industry especially since high cod removal can potentially be achieved if uf is operated in series the process was characterised by high initial fluxes followed by rapid fouling due to cake formation which dominated and pore blockage the excess cake formation induced cake filtration the high feed organic load and particle size distribution caused inevitable fouling controlling the degree with which each fouling mechanism occurred and limited the highest achievable process performance however tmp dictated the severity of fouling and its resulting effect on the flux and organic removal within the range specified as a result of the feed characteristics this study demonstrates the potential for uf as a pre treatment method for process water in a recycled paper mill using 100 rcf a critical step in implementing the kidney strategy and achieving water system closure for these challenging
