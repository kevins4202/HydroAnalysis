24530,the large ecosystems region country and planet have many properties common with complex systems the main such characteristics include dynamic instability e g weather dependence weak causality many possible causes per event and event driven behavior especially in arid and semi arid areas this paper focuses attention on modeling ecosystems by approaches used for complex systems when modeling complex ecosystems we usually encounter the following difficulties partiality large amounts of data and uncertainties of conclusions it can be said that none of the known approaches solves these difficulties perfectly the most common is the physical approach sometimes reinforced by statistical procedures the physical approach to modeling leads to a complicated description of phenomena associated with relatively simple geometry a complicated description usually requires a large amount of data measured or simulated and thus more complicated calculations if we assume emergences in the ecosystem a physical approach is not appropriate at all in the presented article we apply the approach of so called structural invariants which has the opposite properties a simple description of phenomena associated with a more complex geometry in our case pre geometry it does not require as much data and calculations are simple the price paid is a qualitative interpretation of the results which carries a special type of uncertainty the structural invariant used in the article is the invariant matroid and bases of matroid m bm in combination with ramsey graph theory in addition the article introduces a calculus that describes the emergent phenomenon using two quantities the power of the emergent phenomenon and the complexity of the structure that is associated with this phenomenon the developed method is used for a novel application of modeling the process of desertification of earth in this approach we understand desertification as an emergent evolutionary operation of the earth s development in the sequence of two large previous emergences warming of the earth about 11 700 years ago and drying of the earth beginning about 6000 years ago the time of possible further emergences related to the desert expansion operation is calculated the second application of the method is the analysis of the operation violation of short water cycle in the landscape and its possible contribution to the desertification keywords modeling of complex ecosystems structural invariant approach emergent situations violations of structural invariants matroids matroid bases desertification violation of short water cycle 1 introduction in this article we will focus on modeling complex ecosystems and especially on the issue of emergent behavior and the emergent situations in complex ecosystems there are many of such phenomena e g eruptions of large volcanoes invasions of wood parasites e g ips typographus sudden extinction of species and the event driven processes in arid systems westoby et al 1989 the process to which we will apply the developed theory is the extension of deserts in the earth and associated process of violation of the small water cycle the emergence is discussed in this paper as a basic evolutionary operation that is important also for the evolution of planet s ecosystem the ecosystems fulfill the most of items that characterize complex systems in general as it will be introduced in appendix b on the other hand not all modeling means suitable for modeling complex systems are suitable for modeling ecosystems in the following small overview are introduced some modeling approaches used in the recent time for modeling ecosystems physical approach e g rodríguez et al 2019 probability and statistical approach e g viola et al 2010 state approach e g tamzen et al 2003 bila et al 2011 system ecological approach e g odum 2002 simulation approach e g svoboda et al 2017 conceptual modeling approach e g noon 2002 structural invariant approach e g bila 2019 bila et al 2021 each of these introduced approaches has its advantages and disadvantages and could be characterized by many pages for the complex ecosystems where is important the dynamics of processes are used the physical and simulation approaches sometimes the state approach for complex systems and complex ecosystems with emergent behavior is proposed in this paper the structural invariant approach e g in bila et al 2011 bila 2014 2017 as an application field is used in the paper the problem of desertification the desertification is considered here not only as a problem of drought but as the problem of the landscape and planet evolution this is the reason why we used another formal means than were used in papers focusing drought especially hydrological drought e g ionita et al 2017 hanel et al 2018 the development of deserts is usually discussed in connection with the processes of soil drying and crop failure however soil drying and crop failure are influenced by many parameters and the hierarchy of these parameters is as yet unknown usually are introduced the following factors and events e g in alkemade et al 2009 demenocal 2001 pokorny 2015 complex feedback relations between oceans atmosphere sea ice and the vegetation cycle of the land the internal variability of climatic oscillators e g el nino and nao rapid changes in solar activity big volcanic eruptions changes in large ocean flows the indicators for desertification of the earth are manifold and most of them are quite vague e g 40 of the fertile soil all over the world has disappeared since 1960 in sudan the desert advanced 100 km to the south within a period of 17 years the thar desert in india has been advancing by 1 km per year the atacama desert in peru and chile has been advancing by 3 km per year since 2004 spain has been under threat of lengthy dry periods pessimistically tuned people calculate very easily from above data the end optimists introduce examples of some defensive activities e g senegal is planning a green wall across africa in the form of a line of trees 7000 km in length from dakar in the west to djibouti on the east coast the aim is to counter the southward extension of the sahara china is developing a forest dam 4500 km in length and hundreds of kilometers in width to counter the penetration of sand from the gobi desert pitahaya cactuses which consume ten times less water than citrus plantations are being planted in arid areas experiments with a sponge that facilitates plant growth in a dry environment are being carried out in india in egypt investments are being made in irrigation projects weather modification experiments are being carried out in many countries especially with cloud seeding bruintjes 1999 the question if our defensive activities are directed by right direction is very relevant turning to history we have some information sources however not too many and besides these sources describe usually human point of view to events and they do not discover essential hidden drivers of events this is the case of the emergence of deserts in mesopotamia weiss et al 1993 and in mexico demenocal 2001 and in many other countries today we are sure that the reason of human exodus in these countries was drought but what was the driver of the drought desertification of historical civilizations is associated also with gradual drainage for the cultivation of steppe growths wheat barley urbanization and loss of vegetation leads to drying which explains the theory of the biotic pump areas with abundant forests and vegetation supplied with water have abundant rainfall even several thousand km inland e g in ponting 1991 temporary research of the desertification history works mainly with proxy data and with some global theories and hypotheses some proxy data insufficient and unreliable are available for studies of climate change e g in meteorological databases however systematically collected data in this field goes back not more than 250 years from relevant theories and hypotheses we introduce only the following ones milankovitch theory kutzbach et al 1985 milankovitch theory describes the changing nature of the earth s orbit over time the influence of this variability has been identified as the dominant factor in climate changes over a period of hundreds and even thousands of years reductions in the solar power consumption in the northern hemisphere within the milankovitch cycle weaken the intensity of the summer monsoon and indirectly cause drying of the land e g in north africa in central america in the northern part of south america and in central asia global warming global warming is considered as one of the substantial emergences with the start in 11700 years ago from now the beginning of land drying the start of the land drying is dated in 6 000 years ago bradley et al 2003 bond et al 1997 this was a long term average trend with intermittently alternating dry and wet seasons bond s cycle bond et al 1997 bond suggests a period of quasi harmonic oscillation of warm or dry and cold or wet seasons bond identified 5 such cycles and determined their periodicity for 1500 years cycles the most recent period of the last bond cycle is sometimes referred to as the little ice age fagan 2001 the little ice age fagan 2001 as a little ice age is in most understood an extremely wet and cold period lasting about 500 years from about 1350 until about 1850 positive feedback on the development of weather in some sufficiently large area the sequence of phases is considered to be low precipitation drying of vegetation decreased evapotranspiration increasing temperature drying of the landscape no precipitation eruptions of large volcanoes eruptions of large volcanoes are usually followed by cold and wet seasons mount tambora in indonesia erupted in 1815 so much ash was released that there was no summer in europe in the following year 1816 the quality of the vegetation declined and as a consequence there were reduced harvests this was by no means a unique event in history the overview introduced above draws on previously known knowledge and is the source for further theories and hypotheses unfortunately it cannot go beyond certain circumstances which are considered as important but which are not understood quite well for example the internal variability of climatic oscillators e g el nino and nao notes on the organization of the paper section 2 contains an overview of the proposed method in section 3 are explained methodological details of the method section 4 and section 5 are concentrated on example applications continuation of extension of deserts and violation of short water cycle section 6 containes a discussion related to some more complicated points of the paper section 7 summarizes the main achievements of the paper in the conclusion the paper has four appendices appendix a soft tuning u c appendix b complex systems and emergent siatuations appendix c case study for violation of swc in south bohemia czech republic appendix d related works 2 the overview of the proposed method the properties of complex systems are summarized in appendix b in this section we focus on the overview of the method of analysis detection of emergent situations important terms from appendix b are the two modeling planes nat and symb nat is close to material models an example of an aircraft wing behavior model in the nat plane is in an aerodynamic tunnel symb is a level of sign and especially symbolic models the model of wing behavior in the symb level is given by the appropriate system of equations both types of models are related to a selected compartment a local model of the considered complex system more in appendix c furthermore the understanding of the detection of an emergent situation as the detection of the violation of a so called structural invariant in the symb level is essential details are in section 3 and then in appendix b the terms symptom and driver are very essential in our method symptoms are observable variables that characterize the considered process drivers are variables and factors that are associated with the considered process as conditions influences states and control actions in other words the complexity of the emergent phenomenon is decomposed into the space of symptoms and into the space of drivers some structural invariant is calculated from their mutual relation while the symptom space is usually very simple the driver space can be more complex this step of associating the symptom space and the driver space with a structural invariant is the basis of our method the method in our method we do not start from the observed properties and their values as in the case of the physical model but we start from the possible consequences of the considered emergent phenomenon consequences are expressed by symptom values these values are transformed into the driver space where there are computed parameters of the selected structural invariant i e the structure and the number of divers associated with the considered emergent phenomenon the detection of emergent situations there is indicated by the violation of a structural invariant throughout the article we focus mainly on the detection of emergent situations by indicating the violation of the structural invariant matroid bases of matroid m bm matroids are examples of pre geometries a concentrated scheme of steps for the structural invariant m bm is introduced by fig 1 in section 4 after explanation of all details examples of application of the method for another structural invariants have been published e g in bila et al 2000 2011 3 methodological details structural invariant approach to modeling of complex systems 3 1 structural invariants first structural invariants are structures not simple properties or numbers in bila 2011 bila et al 2000 2019 we have explored a few structural invariants e g m bm matroid bases of matroid dm rul dulmage mendelsohn decomposition set of evaluated rules alg trs algebra of transformations susy super symmetries in quantum physics structural invariants are considered as symbolical objects in symb that enabled us to detect an emergent situation by indicating their violation violation of a structural invariant that we register in symb indicates paes possible appearance of emergent situation that is in nat in the case of the structural invariant m bm its violation is represented by the extension of some basis of the matroid this extension can only be made by an element that comes from the outside of the matroid and which satisfies conditions of a concrete matroid basis in the next two sub sections we will show how emss can be detected using the structural invariant m bm 3 2 matroids and ramsey theory of graph when we use the notion of geometry in the system modeling we are always responsible for the suitability of the selected geometry geometry is not usually derived from the properties of the space but is assigned to it euclidean geometry geometry of hilbert space geometry of minkowki space and others we do not have this responsibility in the case of matroids that belong according to one of their representation to pre geometries the conditions introducing matroid concept use the definition of the set and two more definitions the relation of independence ind and the axiom of heridity no metric function no geometry it is remarkable how many knowledge have been derived from such a simple initial facts from matroid theory oxley 2001 we use here only the conceptual part and few related concepts as independence relation ind basis number of elements in the bases etc and several theorems that are in textbooks and which are not mentioned here however we implicitly work with them for the description of a complex system the relations of independence ind resp dependence dnt represent interactions between real elements of the modelled system the combination of matroid theory with ramsey theory of graph rtg makes these disciplines a very powerful tool first a few general facts a matroid is usually introduced oxley 2001 as the following structure 1 m x ind n 1 n 2 n n x mb where x is the ground set of elements components ind is a relation of independence n1 n2 nn are independent sets and mb is a set of matroid bases matroid bases are maximum according to cardinality independent sets in practical cases it is advantageous to use a dependence relation dnt as an example of dnt relation we introduce the following one relation is defined with regard to a problem factor α definition 3 1 elements x1 x2 x are dependent dnt x1 x2 α with regard to a given problem factor α if one or two three or four of the following conditions holds hold i elements x1 x2 associate each other respect to a given problem factor α in the same way or in similar way and principle taking into account elements from x expert criterion ii there are changes variations of x1 which are associated with changes variations in x2 or vv with regard to a given problem factor α and with regard to elements from x e g there exists a function x1 f x2 iii the application of x1 implies the application of x2 or vv with regard to a given problem factor α and with regard to elements from x e g x1 x2 iv the application of x1 excludes the application of x2 or vv with regard to a given problem factor α and with regard to elements from x e g x1 x2 examples of the problem factor phenomenon of floods fault in the system increase in temperature violation of the short water cycle note 3 1 there are of course other relations of dependence oxley 2001 for our conditions a simple theorem holds theorem 1 2 x 1 x 2 x n o t dnt x 1 x 2 a ind x 1 x 2 a before we formulate an essential rule for the detection of an emergent situation we describe a construction of matroid and its bases on a set x construction bases of matroid are formed on a squared matrix x x a basis is formed by an expert which responses the question are elements xi xj dependent respect to problem factor α according to definition def 1 dnt xi xj α if yes the corresponding field of matrix i j is fulfilled by 1 if not by 0 if the question is not relevant in the field will be according to theorem 1 above a basis of matroid is represented by elements of x for which holds 3 b x x n b x i 1 x im x ij x ik dnt x ij x ik a 0 for all j k 1 m an example of the construction of matroid and its bases is introduced in the appendix c theorem 2 4 b k b q m b b k b q all bases of the matroid have the same number of elements now we may form an essential sentence for the detection of an appearance of emergent situation an extension of a matroid basis by at least one element is considered in this paper as a violation of structural invariant m bm and it is considered as an internal indicator of a possible appearance of an emergent situation 3 2 1 extension of matroid basis it is clear that extending element elements must come from outside the original matroid in abstract space where is situated considered matroid it is enough to verify the relation ind however turning back to the reality of the emergent phenomenon this element must be semantically associated with real elements of the external description if we are working e g with problems of floods and we are searching for some real extending element it is clear that it cannot be for example ice cream this trivial condition must be provided by a man that constructs the extension the extension of the basis of the matroid from the technical point of view can be done by two ways m1 from the cardinality of the matroid we calculate the minimum number of elements that must be added to the matroid to have an extending element among them in detail in section 4 and in appendix c the number min δf rn is the minimal difference between the next ramsey number and the current ramsey number section 4 expression 14 ramsey number is introduced in nearest text m2 we find an extension element verifying the possibility of the extension of some basis ind section 4 expression 15 3 2 2 association with ramsey theorem weinstein 2018 if relation ind is considered as a binary relation the following consequences can be used the bases mb will be constructed as perfect sub graphs in a perfect graph each node is connected with all other nodes of x the independent and dependent elements in a perfect graph gp v e are easily constructed by coloring the edges of the complete graph by two colors and the formalism of ramsey numbers r b y b mb is offered for use we now introduce a free formulation of the relations on a perfect graph gp colored by two colors as a consequence of the famous ramsey theorem theorem 3 a perfect graph gp v e with n nodes where each edge belongs to class a or to class b contains a complete subgraph with a nodes and edges from class a or a complete subgraph with b nodes and edges from class b such a number r a b n is called a ramsey number historical note until now only some ramsey numbers rns are known e g r 3 3 6 r 3 4 9 r 3 5 14 r 3 6 18 r 3 15 73 78 r 4 4 18 r 4 11 96 191 r 6 10 177 1171 r 10 10 798 23 556 r 19 19 17 885 the brackets denote intervals of integer numbers in the calculations in section 4 we will use known table quantities from weinstein 2018 end of note let us turn back to representation of bases as perfect subgraphs with a small explication let us consider ramsey number r 3 4 9 ramsey theorem does not provide that dividing edges of the original perfect graph into dependent and independent edges we obtain 3 or 4 element basis but it could be so as with throwing a six walled dice there is no guarantee that a certain wall will appear at least once after six throws but this can happen note 3 2 the anonymity of ramsey theorem ramsey theorem responses the question how many elements but not which elements the method calculates the conditions that could lead to a possible appearance of an emergent situation however it does not construct the emergent situation itself 3 3 the power and complexity of the emergent phenomena the emergent phenomenon we describe in our view by two variables the power hp of emergent phenomenon and the complexity hcom of emergent phenomenon essential relations between the power hp and the complexity hcom are expressed by two equations 5 h p b 1 h p b u c h c o m b 6 h c o m b 1 h c o m b u h p b where b mb is a basis of a matroid and b 1 is the basis b extended by one element variables hp b hp b 1 and hcom b hcom b 1 are power and complexity of emergent phenomenon related to bases b and b 1 symbol u denotes the quotient of self organization of the considered complex system represented by a compartment and c is the limit of this quotient the best self organization quotient u c 0 1 represents intelligence of self organizing process that will execute the emergent phenomenon operating with eq 5 we obtain the contribution to power released by emergent phenomenon 7 δ h p b 1 u c h c o m b where δhp b 1 represents the registrable changes in the system associated with the emergent phenomenon and hcom b represents the complexity of the system of drivers that provide δhp b 1 the link between δhp b 1 and hcom b is provided by u c the intelligence quotient of the system the quantity of u c is done by rough estimations in table 1 and by soft tuning in appendix a as it will be seen in section 5 the value of u c is very sensitive and important for the result of application of expressions 5 6 7 the values introduced in table 1 are characteristic values for the corresponding classes of complex systems but not absolutely rigged for computation for example the value of u c for the first class of complex systems inanimate natural systems avalanches deserts floods earthquake and tsunami may alternate between 0 01 and 0 15 more adequate precise quantity is achieved by the procedure of soft tuning see appendix a the contribution to power of the emergent phenomenon δhp b 1 that is associated with hcom b by eqs 5 7 has its external representation δhd b 1 e g precipitation in a selected region appendix c measured by quantities of external variables symptoms si i 1 n for emergent siem and for nominal sinom situations 8 δ h d b 1 i 1 n w i s i e m s i n o m 2 1 2 f o r i 1 n 9 δ h d b 1 δ h d b 1 where ωi are quotients of importance and λ is a calibration constant the contribution to power of emergent phenomenon δhd b 1 results in a dimensionless real number expressed herein for example contribution for 20 is calculated as 120 100 1 2 eq 7 is associated with eq 5 where hcom is approximated in our case by number of elements of basis b i e b function ξ transforms real number δhp b 1 u c into nearest higher integer and holds 10 ξ δ h p b 1 u c b for explanation we describe a contribution δhd b 1 of power of a possible ems by approximating the emergent and nominal values of the selected variables in the compartment of real world conceptually these variables represent symptoms of the considered emergent phenomenon using calibration constant λ we find δhp b 1 then we form an abstract structure of drivers in the pre geometry space matroid and matroid bases and we compute by 10 the cardinality b 4 detecting emergent situations with help of m bm the description of the process with emergent situation that we want to indicate in the complex system compartment has the following form in nat and symb 11 nat synchronization of events or change of the structure of cs or s e paes 12 symb δ h p b 1 stru ctur al inva riant si vsi dete ction of paes where paes is a possible appearance of emergent situation si is a structural invariant vsi is a violation of structural invariant s e is something else and δhp b 1 is an aggregated result power of an emergent phenomenon detected in symb in the case that si is a matroid and its bases the following expression holds 13 symb δ h p b 1 x 1 mb 1 x 1 b 1 x 1 e 1 b 1 e 1 x 2 b 2 where x1 x2 are carriers of matroids mb1 is a set of bases on x1 b1 is a basis from mb1 e1 is a set of elements that extends x1 and e1 is an element that extends basis b1 into b2 example 4 1 x 1600 b 11 for x 1597 the threat of paes in nat is represented in symb with the addition of at least 40 elements that enable one element extension of the basis b 12 for x 1637 end of the example we formulate now a basic rule for analyzing detecting an emergent situation in relation with expression 13 as follows for case m1 sub section 3 2 paragraph extension of matroid basis 14 i f e 1 m i n δ f r n p a e s where e1 is a set that extends the matroid x1 mb1 13 and contains at least one element e1 extending basis b1 the number min δf rn is the minimal difference between the next ramsey number and the current ramsey number and paes denotes the possible appearance of an emergent situation the number δf rn provides that at least one element could be connected with relation ind with all elements of some basis from mb1 for case m2 sub section 3 2 paragraph extension of matroid basis 15 i f e i n d e x i x i b 1 p a e s where e is an extending element for which was verified independence ind to all elements of b1 4 1 normalization of δjf rn with regard to a real volume of added elements the following operation is actual for cases where the detecting of paes in pre geometry can be represented by the addition of real elements to the compartment of real world e g drivers in an ecosystem or the addition of a time interval to given time moment in other cases we don t have to do this because we don t know what s going on in the system in such cases we just transform the power of an emergent phenomenon into matroid pre geometry eqs 7 10 explain a method of the detection of paes without considering the actual volume of δhp b 1 however the actual state from which we calculate δj f rn corresponds to some number of active elements that is different from rn b in general the information about the current number of elements v b is a complementary information and it does not influence the calculation according eqs 14 15 the normalization procedure for the alternative m1 has the following steps let us assume that we have computed δhp b 1 eqs 7 9 from this number is possible to acquire b by eq 10 considering b as a number of elements of a basis we compute rn b this number corresponds to an actual state of the complex system and thus to a volume of elements in this state let us denote rn b corresponds to v b from this correspondence we extract a normalization quotient λ 16 λ v b r n b after computation rn b 1 we extrapolate the quantity v b 1 17 v b 1 λ rn b 1 then the value δf rn corresponds to value δv b b 1 the number of elements that is necessary to add to v b 18 δ v b b 1 λ δ f r n the normalization procedure for the alternative m2 is very easy however is not needed to introduce it here 4 2 summary of the whole process of analysis of an emergent situation in fig 1 the process starts with estimated values of symptoms sem snom representing the considered emergent phenomenon in an aggregated form δhp b 1 this value is transformed into the structural invariant in this case matroid and its bases m mb indicating violation of this invariant by the extension of some matroid base there is detected a possible appearance of emergent situation paes in fig 2 is seen the comparison of outputs from the physical model of floods with calculation of drivers of emergent phenomenon 4 2 1 physical model examples of inputs of floods in the selected compartment of the landscape precipitation structure of the network of mobile water carriers in the area rivers streams channels flows on water carriers structure of the network of water capacities lakes ponds structure of the setting of controllers of water carriers in the area gates sluices secondary waterways meteorological situations images of situations from radars that led did not lead to floods examples of outputs in the selected compartment of the landscape heights of raised water levels size of flooded areas number of destroyed buildings 4 2 2 calculation of emergent situations examples of some consequences associated with floods in the selected compartment of the landscape symptoms average and raised height of water levels in water carriers rivers brooks streams basins that interact in the considered region numbers of standard and affected buildings in danger of flooding in the considered region examples of drivers associated with floods are abstract drivers b b 1 δv b b 1 and concrete drivers water carriers participating in floods cracked dams of ponds water carriers involved in the flood floodgates in poor condition broken and rusted the block of calculation for emergent situations is not a model and it does not represent any causal relation it is a block of calculation 5 illustration of an application of the developed method extending deserts and violation of short water cycle so far we have mentioned two huge emergent situations in this context which have had an impact on the emergence of deserts and their simultaneous expansion global warming and the beginning of land drying our task and the aim of the article is to calculate under what conditions another emergent situation could occur associated with the development of deserts if we summarize our knowledge of the possibilities of modeling desertification from the introduction we are embarrassed neither the theory and hypotheses milankovitch theory bond s cycle fagan s the little ice age nor the overview of various desert expansion stories breckle et al 2002 give us an answer they don t even give instructions on the way let s go into the problem more deeply milankovitch theory bond s cycle describe rather continuous phenomena that have a cyclic character the evaluation of desert records breckle et al 2002 would most likely lead to statements such as in 10 years the atacama desert will advance 10 km at the southern end nothing about emergences nothing about a sudden dangerous change that comes with desert expansion we would expect for example within five years there will be strong hot waves in marrakech which input data could we get from the introduced hypotheses and theories only proxy data or none the task that classical research solves is different from what we describe in this article in the following sub section we will try to give an example of calculating the qualitative distance to the following emergence which is related to desert expansion the calculation is based on a simple description using very concentrated data and with transformation into a pre geometric space from where we get output knowledge 5 1 continuation of extension of deserts the model calculations 7 18 introduced in the previous sub sections leaded to a number of compartment elements that is necessary to add to a current number of compartment element to associate an emergent situation in the procedure of normalization these elements were represented by concrete divers in this sub section is illustrated the case when the difference between each two added elements represents a time unit and an elementary part of an oriented time scale the method of the transfer from the set of added elements to a time intervals was explained in bila et al 2019 the application of our method results in the time interval to the next possible appearance of emergent situation with regard to extension of deserts we use the following pilot data from the history a global warming before 11 700 years from now bond et al 1997 is considered global warming as one of the substantial emergences b the land drying began 6 000 years ago alverson et al 2003 wanner et al 2008 as the second substantial emergence it was a long term average trend with intermittently alternating dry and wet seasons we use for our computation only one dominant reliable fact a symptom discovered in year 2006 alverson et al 2003 deserts cover 47 million km2 of dry land this amounts to 35 of the land area of the world we will speak about a single world desert we denote the area of the desert da in time td as da td we consider two times td 2006 and time no desert nd in order to conserve the logic of modeling the development of the desert as a single desert of the world we introduce the following variable s 1 da td and for variables sem and snom s e m 1 d a 2006 1 0 35 1 35 s n o m 1 d a n d 1 0 1 if we consider that at the beginning of some paleoecological cycle there was no dry land then the corresponding contribution with calibration constant λ 1 according eq 9 to the power of the emergent phenomenon related to year 2006 is 19 δ h p b 1 i 1 1 w i s i e m s i n o m 2 1 2 s i e m s i n o m 1 35 1 1 35 only for checking the logic of the computation for time td nd we have δhp b 1 1 using table 1 we take u c 0 1 and by method in appendix a we calculate tuned quotient u c 0 1 and from 10 we compute the cardinality of a matroid basis 20 ξ δ h p b 1 u c b 14 we continue with determining rn 3 14 x 66 78 using the table in weinstein 2018 the next ramsey number is rn 3 15 x 73 78 from weinstein 2018 applying expression 14 21 i f e 1 m i n δ f r n p a e s we find the nearest ramsey numbers for b 14 rn 4 14 141 349 rn 5 14 221 and the nearest ramsey numbers for b 1 15 rn 4 15 153 417 rn 5 15 242 combinations of ramsey numbers for the selection of a minimal difference δf rn δf rn rn x 15 rn y 14 rn y 14 66 78 141 349 221 rn y 15 73 78 153 417 242 and we express rn x 15 rn y 14 in the sequence 22 73 66 78 66 78 78 153 141 note 5 1 the next differences δf rn are larger than the introduced differences and they have not been considered for detecting paes we use only two minimal differences from the sequence above δf rn 7 and δf rn 0 23 if e 1 7 or e 1 0 paes now we attempt to estimate the time for the appearance of the next emergent situation as was stated at the section 3 and at the beginning of this section we have access only to very unreliable data proxy data and at the same time we are using a combinatorial method that gives us results as a set of possibilities thus

the calculated numbers are very rough estimations of the next possible appearance of an emergent situation that could bring a possible change in the climate with regard to the extension of deserts 5 2 violation of short water cycle vswc the issues of periods of drought the history of droughts and extreme rainfall events in europe are addressed in great details in many articles e g ionita et al 2017 hanel et al 2018 svoboda et al 2017 our approach works with more integrated concepts such as short water cycle pokorny 2019 overheated landscape hesslerova et al 2018 air rivers makarieva and gorshkov 2007 hesslerova et al 2019 in this sub section we discover which properties are essential for the phenomenon of violation of the short water cycle vswc could be one of the factors of desertification with regard to various causes of desertification from the introduction we introduce a rough scheme of dehydration of land s point small precipitation drying of vegetation decreased evapotranspiration increase of temperature drying landscape no precipitation s point the introduced cycle was confirmed e g in hesslerova et al 2019 where the principal effect of temperature increase on landscape dehydration was related to the destruction of forests makarieva and gorshkov 2007 this sequence is associated with a key question why did not rain at the beginning of this loop we propose the following reasons a the principle reason lies in some global effect e g in the milankovitch effect kutzbach et al 1985 b the atmospheric humidity has gone to some other place vswc bila et al 2011 why a possible response for b the basic reason consisted in the establishment of potential fields of temperatures and pressures in the atmosphere of segments of dry land when there was a homogeneous field of temperature and pressure without none differences there was no potential inducing motion after the formation of at least two segments of dry land with significantly high differences of temperatures and pressures the transport layer in the atmosphere attempted to equalize these differences formation of potential differences of physical variables is a natural phenomenon and if we would consider it as a starting process of desertification then the desertification of the earth is also a natural phenomenon other way how to explain the above question is the influence of a positive feedback between kernel variables paper bila et al 2011 presented a model of the situation of a violation of the so called short water cycle in a selected ecosystem the trebon basin in south bohemia czech republic the short water cycle swc refers to the behavior of the local ecosystem e g the trebon region in which the volume of water that enters the ecosystem is evaporated condensed and falls back into the system as the precipitation in more details it means vegetation is cooled by the vapor of water the air above the vegetation has high relative humidity rises slowly upwards and after a few hundred meters reaches the dew point clouds form and rain in the afternoon from a thousand liters of water vapor one liter of liquid water is generated and the heat is released rising upwards with expired dry air flowing into the ocean to pick up new water with the rain the pressure has decreased and the moist air from the surrounding area is attracted horizontally if there is enough vegetation forest so the moist air is attracted all the way from the sea reasons for violation of swc are many but the most natural is the following one if we drain the landscape and cut down the forests the landscape is overheated it is not cooled by the vapor of water from the heated surfaces heats the air which rises rapidly upwards several meters per second this air has low relative humidity it is heated but it contains water vapor from the remains of the forest ponds and it rises too high before reaching the dew point the water falls at best somewhere in the mountains in the worse up to the ocean that is the principle of drying out by air rivers which occurs in an overheated landscape this phenomenon is probably occurring now in the třeboň basin in our country the landscape is overheated due to lack of water and vegetation not as a result of high concentrations of co2 the calculation of drivers which influence on the violation of short water cycle is done in appendix c 6 discussion in this section we cover only two points of view a what was not introduced and not regarded in the paper b what could be controversial a1 there are almost no measurements in the article especially measurements of some typically ecological and meteorological variables such as pressure temperature humidity there are two reasons for this on the one hand values of quantities used in the calculations are quantities of general validity and they are presented in scientific papers without further experimental evidence e g soil drying on earth began about 6000 years ago or for analysis of desert development on earth we have so called proxy data not deeper than 250 years ago or since the beginning of the drying of the soil on earth almost 35 2006 of the total land area has been converted to desert or dry soil these data are almost qualitative in nature and have a high degree of uncertainty however the formalism used in the calculations and the conclusions obtained also lead to qualitative results if we use measured values for calculations they are related to locally limited areas compartments e g in appendix c these values have the character of average values related to a certain time interval and again lead to qualitative results a2 in the article we do not address the problem of ecosystem management in order to improve the situation for example to eliminate swc violation at the end of appendix c it was stated that one of the strategies of such control would be to eliminate the actions of all found drivers that lead to vswc although we have a list of such drivers it is not clear how they interact each other and the proportions in which they should be effective in improving the situation at the same time we state that due to the weak causality of a complex ecosystem sugihara et al 2012 westoby et al 1989 it is not possible to calculate these proportions in principle b1 symptom selection when calculating the contribution to power of the emergent phenomenon δhp b 1 we work with a certain selection of symptoms and their nominal and emergent values coefficients for individual symptoms in the eq 8 are obtained either by the saaty method saaty 1978 or by sensitivity analysis according to eq 7 the hcom b complexity value can be calculated to the given contribution of the power of emergent phenomenon when choosing symptoms the main rule is to cover the process of emergent phenomenon as for other complex systems there is necessary to collaborate with experts for example if we characterize the emergent phenomenon of flash floods fig 2 and lit qiuling yao et al 2016 we cannot forget about the average of the water level stroke and the number of buildings affected on the contrary we do not need to indicate the number of sandbags that were used in the construction of improvised small dams near the affected buildings b2 coefficient u c coefficient u c plays an important role in the eq 7 and in the derived calculations this so called coefficient of intelligence characterizes the environment in which the emergent phenomenon takes place the closer this environment is to the inanimate phase e g desert sand compared to the living phase swarm of bees the lower the coefficient u c is and the more elements in our additive representation of drivers see b3 it is necessary to deploy to achieve a given performance of the emergent phenomenon table 1 shows the indicative values of the coefficient u c obtained empirically and means nothing more than that the coefficients of intelligence of all possible complex systems are distributed over a real closed interval 0 1 for especially mixed complex systems there may be a debate as to whether the values u c should be different especially because and for the role played by the coefficient u c in our method the article is equipped with appendix a which correlates the type of complex system with the method of calculating complexity size u c was studied at work bila 2014 b3 search for drivers both in sub section 5 1 and especially in appendix c we look for the specific content of drivers to the calculated complexity of the system represented here by the number of main drivers the number of elements of a matroid basis once again we are getting to the empirical level surface and with the help of an expert we are looking for quantities and operators that could have a significant influence on the behavior of the ecosystem and on the emergent phenomenon violating the small water cycle the only formal feature that we check when expanding some of the found basis of the matroid is the independence ind of the extending element to the elements of that basis if we find this element driver right away we do not need to solve anything further case m2 in section 4 the second case of extending the base m1 in section 4 consists in finding and adding δf rn drivers from the given area to the original matroid adding δf rn drivers to the matroid carrier induces the possibility of attaching at least one element that would extend some basis we are speaking about an additive representation of drivers 7 conclusions in this article we focused on one important phenomenon that change the face of the planet desertification we talked about the desertification of the planet as a process associated with two fundamental emergent phenomena global warming and soil drying in classical science analyzing the phenomenon of desertification requires an enormous amount of data documenting all possible influences and dependencies we did not use this path in which the physical approach prevails not only for lack of suitable data but mainly for the method of data synthesis in this article we used a method based on the violation of so called structural invariants which replaced weak volumes of observation and data with constructions in the pre geometric space the article led to two results the first result was the calculation of the time for the next possible appearance of an emergent situation associated with desert expansion the second result was the discovery of factors and parameters that influence on the violation of the so called short small water cycle these factors and parameters are presented in an integral form and cover a large volume of partial influences e g parameter decrease of quality of vegetation cover of landscape entails the extirpation of forests the drying of wetlands the construction of new reflecting areas car parks etc the article remains at the level of analysis and does not give a solution to the phenomenon of

complexity of the compartment of the complex system given by the number of a matroid basis hcom b b the procedure for calculating and determining the coefficient u c is based on the following limitations and conditions a1 u c 0 1 a2 δ h p b 1 0 1 a3 b z procedure for computation of u c s1 first is computed δhp b 1 resp δhd b 1 s2 fulfilling condition u c 0 1 for orientation is possible to use estimations from table 1 is chosen the quantity b s3 in the list of ramsey numbers 28 we find numbers r 3 b r 4 b r r1 b numbers r b are sometimes given as subsets on the interval r1 r2 and r1 r2 z s4 we find the nearest numbers r 3 b 1 r 4 b 1 r r2 b 1 s5 we compute combinations of ramsey numbers for the selection of a minimal difference a4 δ f r n r n x b 1 r n y b so we find numbers rn y b p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 and rn x b 1 q1 q2 q3 q4 q5 and we express the sequence q1 p1 q1 p2 q2 p2 q2 p3 q3 p3 s6 from this sequence is computed δ1f rn min q1 p1 q1 p2 q2 p2 q2 p3 q3 p3 s7 we turn back to step s2 and we select another u c fulfilling condition a s8 we continue till the step s6 and compute δ2f rn min s9 this procedure from s7 to s8 is repeated as many times as possible until the variability of the sequence δ1f rn δkf rn is seen s10 the best value of the quotient u c is a number for which we found a5 m i n δ 1 f r n δ k f r n s11 for this value of u c we solve eq 7 from sub section 6 3 and we continue in the method appendix b complex systems and emergent situations complex systems have certain properties that differentiate them from other systems the following features are examples of such properties that have already been classified bila 2014 another list of properties is introduced e g in petty 2014 many elements in mutual interactions multidimensionality quasi stability in state changes nonlinear characteristics self organizing processes emergent behavior motions at the border of chaos nonstochastic future there is no necessary to illustrate that complex ecosystems have the most of the introduced features the description of the most characteristics except emergent behavior and self organization leads to a physical approach section 5 before we introduce two types of emss we introduce some general properties of emergent phenomena and emergent situations a even if we know the causes of situations and they can be simulated there may be discovered something that has not yet occurred and looks like emergence this can be seen in generative systems this will be called in this paper as the actual emergent situation emsa for a true emergent situation emst we do not know the causes b emergence has no goal if we do not know the goal it cannot be simulated it would not be possible to check if the simulation has reached the correct goal c true emergent situations are unpredictable ones d since some ems are seen theoretically for the first time and unprepared we cannot use the pre prepared observational and symbolical tools as we know it from physics in this process we must distinguish between the behavioral side of the emergent phenomenon and the symbolical side of emergent phenomenon e g we see the soliton in the water canal and we had not seen anything similar before we capture its behavior e g by a photograph as a reflection of the natural phenomenon then at home we can find in books or in the internet what solitons are and we use for their description corresponding equations ffor further reading we reming symbols nat and tsymb introduced in section 2 the overview of the proposed method in works bila 2014 2017 have been introduced 3 classes of emergent situations a b c in this paper we need only types b and c emergent situations class b b1 the causes of these situations are not known in nat but their output forms are known b2 the situation appears suddenly without an explicit association with situations in the previous relevant time space context of the system b3 in the mind of a human observer the situation appears as a meaningful image situated in nat e g as a behavior behavior of a group of termites as a process tsunami traffic jam on the highway as a property super conductivity b4 it does not matter whether the ems has been induced by the coincidence of events or by a sudden change in the complex system structure in nat or by something else in all such cases the ems can be detected as a change of the structure or the violation of structural invariant in level symb using structural invariant approach however it may be registered only as a possible appearance of emergent situation paes b5 the detailed reasons and the internal causes of the appearance of the true emergent situation emst are not known in nat and therefore is impossible to propose a complete prediction model in symb but we are able to form a detection model for paes using structural invariant approach situations belonging to this class include a change in behavior strategy in a swarm colony bila 2014 the appearance of floods emsa and emst bila 2014 yao et al 2016 the appearance of rough waves in the ocean emst the appearance of traffic jams on the highway emsa and emst and desertification of the landscape and of the earth emst emergent situations of class c situations in this class have the same properties as the situations from class b except item b1 instead we formulate condition c1 c1 the causes of these situations are not known and their output forms are also not known no model of a situation of this kind is available before it first operates situations that belong to this class include unforeseen instabilities in ecosystems emst emergent events on the sun the appearance of artifacts in nano structures emst as for situations b and c we note that complex systems with emergences show weak causality for some events it is not possible to determine what is the result of what e g the emergent situation great drought in central europe in summer of 2018 buras et al 2020 we do not know if it was a disorder that could have its consequences or if it was a result of a disorder that we have not registered appendix c case study for violation of swc vswc in south bohemia czech republic now we demonstrate application of our method in the calculation of divers for vswc the result of the method application will be the discovery and suggestion of new factors drivers that influence on swc using a conceptual relation between symptoms and drivers section 2 the following symptoms quantified for the selected area in the landscape and for one representative year have been operated s1

trebon basin the following calculation expresses a general situation what if in form which drivers and how influence on the given contribution to emergent phenomenon the calculus for the emergent situation in a complex system which was introduced in sub section 3 3 associates two variables for the emergent situation the power and the complexity first the contribution to the power is computed

elements drivers of some basis c 10 b ξ 1 316 0 44 ξ 2 990 3 it leads to matr oid with x 6 i e rn b 6 with help of our landscape expert we find 6 possible drivers that influence on the life of the ecosystem and violate swc considered as the elements of x x1 high velocity of flowing in transport level of atmosphere 200 m above the landscape surface x2 high level of sun radiation x3 decrease of quality of vegetation cover of landscape x4 small water absorption capacity of the soil x5 decrease of volume of ground water x6 wrong chemical composition of bed layer of the soil exploring the matrix in table 1c with regard to relation dnt xi xj α and according theorem 1 sub section 3 2 we find bases of the matroid a legend for table 1c dnt xi xj α 1 xi is dependent on xj with regard to problem factor α dnt xi xj α 0 xi is independent on xj with regard to problem factor α in case dnt xi xj α question about dependency xi on xj is non relevant the problem factor α was formulated as supports the violation swc in table 1c are discovered two bases b1 b2 c 11 b 1 x 1 x 3 x 6 c 12 b 2 x 1 x 2 x 6 this indicates that the basic reasons for vswc are b1 high velocity of the flow in the transport level of the atmosphere a decrease in the quality of the vegetation cover of the landscape wrong chemical composition of the bed layer of the soil b2 high velocity of the flow in the transport level of the atmosphere a high level of solar radiation wrong chemical composition of the bed layer of the soil the last action that needs to be done is to find at least one driver that may extend the discovered bases the nearest ramsey number rn b 1 is 9 so we try to find three drivers that support the violation of swc α and at least one of them may extend bases b1 b2 i e will be independent to their elements three such drivers could be x7 increasing number and influence of air rivers x8 an increase of anthropogenic effects in the region e g industrial activities x9 long term local dry atmosphere arid soil note c 1 the concept and function of air rivers have been described at the beginning of sub section 5 2 from these three effects x8 and probably x7 may extend b1 and b2 and they are associated with paes violation of swc c 13 b 1 x 1 x 3 x 6 x 8 c 14 b 1 x 1 x 3 x 6 x 7 c 15 b 2 x 1 x 2 x 6 x 8 c 16 b 2 x 1 x 2 x 6 x 7 all discovered drivers support a positive feedback introduced at the beginning of this sub section s point small precipitation drying of vegetation decreased evapotranspiration increase of temperature drying landscape no precipitation s point from the theory of systems is known that such a positive feedback is very hard to control what is possible to do is to cut the line there could be suggested places marked by such a cut means to apply activities of repression i e activities negating decreased evapotranspiration for example to decrease the velocity of flowing in transport level of atmosphere e g in case that the main reason is some anthropogenic influence e g nuclear power station to increase the quality of vegetation cover of landscape to improve the water absorption capacity of the soil to increase the number of water carriers streams lakes ponds the importance of the introduced results has been confirmed as very relevant in the context of climate change all these introduced changes are trivial to understand and they belong to factors of co evolution of the landscape and in large they belong to factors of co evolution of earth fig 1c illustrates situation in the sumava national park in south bohemia the influence of drivers from b1 and b2 has been confirmed violation of swc induced drying the trees this was followed by an invasion of wood parasite ips typographus the next phase is the development of a landscape similar to desert note c 2 this example is introduced here as a reconstruction of a past event however the paes could have been detected at least 10 years ago appendix d related works in the next small overview we focus attention only on three fields related to this paper a complex systems and emergent situations modeling of complex ecosystems b causality in modeling complex ecosystems with emergences c desertification of the earth and the ecological modeling a complex systems and emergent situations the basic concept of complex system does not differ from the concept of the system set of elements bonds between them and mutual interactions however the deeper analysis of complex systems discovered some peculiar properties that are very substantial for their identification and control e g quasi stability in state changes nonlinear characteristics self organizing processes etc it was explained in detail in appendix b moving in the border between physics and cybernetics is good to remind opinions of robert b laughlin concentrated e g in book a different universe reinventing physics from the bottom down laughlin 2006 laughlin introduces emergence as an organization principle and from this point of view explores a wide field of physics the sources of the theory of complex systems that was introduced in appendix b have their background e g in petty 2014 bila 2014 kauffman 1993 reid 2007 laughlin 2006 morgan 1929 these sources are introduced here only for information and as a preface for modeling of complex ecosystems modeling of complex ecosystems typical models that use physical approach are e g rodriguez et al 2019 viola et al 2010 to these models belong also the works focusing problems of drought and precipitation e g ionita et al 2017 hanel et al 2018 svoboda et al 2017 these works are important for the problem of earth desertification however only partially the desertification is the evolutionary process not only water and drought process the authors rodriguez et al 2019 introduce as a best formal tool for modeling of complex ecosystems the thermodynamics beside such models there were developed ecosystems models that introduce special formal tools and that emphasize mainly systemological issues such approaches and models are e g conceptual ecological models and diagrams cmd noon 2002 system ecological models sed odum 2002 with the increase of power of informatic tools we may observe the effort for the synthesis of some manageable integrated models of an ecosystem as an integrated environmental model we name e g not just new system siat verweij et al 2010 these models could be adapted for studies of the progress of desertification but a great deal of additional data will be needed this was the reason why we have not used these models and we concentrated our attention on the development of an own method for the topic of this paper are substantial papers about the short water cycle ripl 1995 hesslerová et al 2018 and a characterization of naturalness alkemade et al 2009 of landscape including temperature fluctuations it is necessary to emphasize that the short water cycle and its violation have their substance in ecology and not in hydrology though it seems to be near of water issues with pleasure we name here the works that have been inspired by situation in sought bohemia czech republic e g kravcik et al 2008 hesslerova et al 2018 that describe the swc b causality in modeling complex ecosystems with emergences for this paper is very relevant work cottam et al 1998 with clear thesis emergence half a quantum jump and papers hannisdal and liow 2018 sugihara et al 2012 that attack the essence of causality and its contribution to predicting system development the emergence is discussed in work cottam et al 1998 as a basic evolutionary operation in paper hannisdal and liow 2018 the authors have investigated a large area of resources based on granger s concept of causality and the concept of causality in dynamic systems finally they focus on the analysis of paleontological time series and more specifically refer to three approaches stochastic differential equations convergent cross mapping transfer of entropy in works hannisdal and liow 2018 sugihara et al 2012 is seen the effort not to go beyond the field of classical mathematics including the assumption about ordering and enumerating emergent phenomena this assumption does not hold in our approach and therefore the mathematical apparatus used in this paper is different from formal means used in hannisdal and liow 2018 sugihara et al 2012 the mathematical background used in our paper is covered in bila 2014 2017 oxley 2001 weinstein 2018 saaty 1978 the most important knowledge from these sources is a conceptual part of theory of matroids combined with essential knowledge from ramsey theory of graph c desertification of the earth and the ecological modeling there are a few of theories that map the reasons of earth s desertification e g changing earth position and movement within the framework of our planetary system e g declinations in the orbit of the earth kutzbach et al 1985 other reasons are hidden in the alternation of wet and dry phases in the earth s climate bond et al 1997 or in some unpredictable changes in earth climate fagan 2001 further works following global changes of earth were introduced in the introduction the great overview of sources in desertification research together with initial insight into problems have been done in breckle veste and wucherer 2002 unfortunately not too many works are devoted in ecological modeling of desertification and if some they are limited to some landscape region from this field we may introduce tamzen et al 2003 peters et al 2012 veron et al 2010 each of these models focuses on special characteristics of desertification e g the model veron et al 2010 confirms the influence of vegetation response on the desertification process 
24530,the large ecosystems region country and planet have many properties common with complex systems the main such characteristics include dynamic instability e g weather dependence weak causality many possible causes per event and event driven behavior especially in arid and semi arid areas this paper focuses attention on modeling ecosystems by approaches used for complex systems when modeling complex ecosystems we usually encounter the following difficulties partiality large amounts of data and uncertainties of conclusions it can be said that none of the known approaches solves these difficulties perfectly the most common is the physical approach sometimes reinforced by statistical procedures the physical approach to modeling leads to a complicated description of phenomena associated with relatively simple geometry a complicated description usually requires a large amount of data measured or simulated and thus more complicated calculations if we assume emergences in the ecosystem a physical approach is not appropriate at all in the presented article we apply the approach of so called structural invariants which has the opposite properties a simple description of phenomena associated with a more complex geometry in our case pre geometry it does not require as much data and calculations are simple the price paid is a qualitative interpretation of the results which carries a special type of uncertainty the structural invariant used in the article is the invariant matroid and bases of matroid m bm in combination with ramsey graph theory in addition the article introduces a calculus that describes the emergent phenomenon using two quantities the power of the emergent phenomenon and the complexity of the structure that is associated with this phenomenon the developed method is used for a novel application of modeling the process of desertification of earth in this approach we understand desertification as an emergent evolutionary operation of the earth s development in the sequence of two large previous emergences warming of the earth about 11 700 years ago and drying of the earth beginning about 6000 years ago the time of possible further emergences related to the desert expansion operation is calculated the second application of the method is the analysis of the operation violation of short water cycle in the landscape and its possible contribution to the desertification keywords modeling of complex ecosystems structural invariant approach emergent situations violations of structural invariants matroids matroid bases desertification violation of short water cycle 1 introduction in this article we will focus on modeling complex ecosystems and especially on the issue of emergent behavior and the emergent situations in complex ecosystems there are many of such phenomena e g eruptions of large volcanoes invasions of wood parasites e g ips typographus sudden extinction of species and the event driven processes in arid systems westoby et al 1989 the process to which we will apply the developed theory is the extension of deserts in the earth and associated process of violation of the small water cycle the emergence is discussed in this paper as a basic evolutionary operation that is important also for the evolution of planet s ecosystem the ecosystems fulfill the most of items that characterize complex systems in general as it will be introduced in appendix b on the other hand not all modeling means suitable for modeling complex systems are suitable for modeling ecosystems in the following small overview are introduced some modeling approaches used in the recent time for modeling ecosystems physical approach e g rodríguez et al 2019 probability and statistical approach e g viola et al 2010 state approach e g tamzen et al 2003 bila et al 2011 system ecological approach e g odum 2002 simulation approach e g svoboda et al 2017 conceptual modeling approach e g noon 2002 structural invariant approach e g bila 2019 bila et al 2021 each of these introduced approaches has its advantages and disadvantages and could be characterized by many pages for the complex ecosystems where is important the dynamics of processes are used the physical and simulation approaches sometimes the state approach for complex systems and complex ecosystems with emergent behavior is proposed in this paper the structural invariant approach e g in bila et al 2011 bila 2014 2017 as an application field is used in the paper the problem of desertification the desertification is considered here not only as a problem of drought but as the problem of the landscape and planet evolution this is the reason why we used another formal means than were used in papers focusing drought especially hydrological drought e g ionita et al 2017 hanel et al 2018 the development of deserts is usually discussed in connection with the processes of soil drying and crop failure however soil drying and crop failure are influenced by many parameters and the hierarchy of these parameters is as yet unknown usually are introduced the following factors and events e g in alkemade et al 2009 demenocal 2001 pokorny 2015 complex feedback relations between oceans atmosphere sea ice and the vegetation cycle of the land the internal variability of climatic oscillators e g el nino and nao rapid changes in solar activity big volcanic eruptions changes in large ocean flows the indicators for desertification of the earth are manifold and most of them are quite vague e g 40 of the fertile soil all over the world has disappeared since 1960 in sudan the desert advanced 100 km to the south within a period of 17 years the thar desert in india has been advancing by 1 km per year the atacama desert in peru and chile has been advancing by 3 km per year since 2004 spain has been under threat of lengthy dry periods pessimistically tuned people calculate very easily from above data the end optimists introduce examples of some defensive activities e g senegal is planning a green wall across africa in the form of a line of trees 7000 km in length from dakar in the west to djibouti on the east coast the aim is to counter the southward extension of the sahara china is developing a forest dam 4500 km in length and hundreds of kilometers in width to counter the penetration of sand from the gobi desert pitahaya cactuses which consume ten times less water than citrus plantations are being planted in arid areas experiments with a sponge that facilitates plant growth in a dry environment are being carried out in india in egypt investments are being made in irrigation projects weather modification experiments are being carried out in many countries especially with cloud seeding bruintjes 1999 the question if our defensive activities are directed by right direction is very relevant turning to history we have some information sources however not too many and besides these sources describe usually human point of view to events and they do not discover essential hidden drivers of events this is the case of the emergence of deserts in mesopotamia weiss et al 1993 and in mexico demenocal 2001 and in many other countries today we are sure that the reason of human exodus in these countries was drought but what was the driver of the drought desertification of historical civilizations is associated also with gradual drainage for the cultivation of steppe growths wheat barley urbanization and loss of vegetation leads to drying which explains the theory of the biotic pump areas with abundant forests and vegetation supplied with water have abundant rainfall even several thousand km inland e g in ponting 1991 temporary research of the desertification history works mainly with proxy data and with some global theories and hypotheses some proxy data insufficient and unreliable are available for studies of climate change e g in meteorological databases however systematically collected data in this field goes back not more than 250 years from relevant theories and hypotheses we introduce only the following ones milankovitch theory kutzbach et al 1985 milankovitch theory describes the changing nature of the earth s orbit over time the influence of this variability has been identified as the dominant factor in climate changes over a period of hundreds and even thousands of years reductions in the solar power consumption in the northern hemisphere within the milankovitch cycle weaken the intensity of the summer monsoon and indirectly cause drying of the land e g in north africa in central america in the northern part of south america and in central asia global warming global warming is considered as one of the substantial emergences with the start in 11700 years ago from now the beginning of land drying the start of the land drying is dated in 6 000 years ago bradley et al 2003 bond et al 1997 this was a long term average trend with intermittently alternating dry and wet seasons bond s cycle bond et al 1997 bond suggests a period of quasi harmonic oscillation of warm or dry and cold or wet seasons bond identified 5 such cycles and determined their periodicity for 1500 years cycles the most recent period of the last bond cycle is sometimes referred to as the little ice age fagan 2001 the little ice age fagan 2001 as a little ice age is in most understood an extremely wet and cold period lasting about 500 years from about 1350 until about 1850 positive feedback on the development of weather in some sufficiently large area the sequence of phases is considered to be low precipitation drying of vegetation decreased evapotranspiration increasing temperature drying of the landscape no precipitation eruptions of large volcanoes eruptions of large volcanoes are usually followed by cold and wet seasons mount tambora in indonesia erupted in 1815 so much ash was released that there was no summer in europe in the following year 1816 the quality of the vegetation declined and as a consequence there were reduced harvests this was by no means a unique event in history the overview introduced above draws on previously known knowledge and is the source for further theories and hypotheses unfortunately it cannot go beyond certain circumstances which are considered as important but which are not understood quite well for example the internal variability of climatic oscillators e g el nino and nao notes on the organization of the paper section 2 contains an overview of the proposed method in section 3 are explained methodological details of the method section 4 and section 5 are concentrated on example applications continuation of extension of deserts and violation of short water cycle section 6 containes a discussion related to some more complicated points of the paper section 7 summarizes the main achievements of the paper in the conclusion the paper has four appendices appendix a soft tuning u c appendix b complex systems and emergent siatuations appendix c case study for violation of swc in south bohemia czech republic appendix d related works 2 the overview of the proposed method the properties of complex systems are summarized in appendix b in this section we focus on the overview of the method of analysis detection of emergent situations important terms from appendix b are the two modeling planes nat and symb nat is close to material models an example of an aircraft wing behavior model in the nat plane is in an aerodynamic tunnel symb is a level of sign and especially symbolic models the model of wing behavior in the symb level is given by the appropriate system of equations both types of models are related to a selected compartment a local model of the considered complex system more in appendix c furthermore the understanding of the detection of an emergent situation as the detection of the violation of a so called structural invariant in the symb level is essential details are in section 3 and then in appendix b the terms symptom and driver are very essential in our method symptoms are observable variables that characterize the considered process drivers are variables and factors that are associated with the considered process as conditions influences states and control actions in other words the complexity of the emergent phenomenon is decomposed into the space of symptoms and into the space of drivers some structural invariant is calculated from their mutual relation while the symptom space is usually very simple the driver space can be more complex this step of associating the symptom space and the driver space with a structural invariant is the basis of our method the method in our method we do not start from the observed properties and their values as in the case of the physical model but we start from the possible consequences of the considered emergent phenomenon consequences are expressed by symptom values these values are transformed into the driver space where there are computed parameters of the selected structural invariant i e the structure and the number of divers associated with the considered emergent phenomenon the detection of emergent situations there is indicated by the violation of a structural invariant throughout the article we focus mainly on the detection of emergent situations by indicating the violation of the structural invariant matroid bases of matroid m bm matroids are examples of pre geometries a concentrated scheme of steps for the structural invariant m bm is introduced by fig 1 in section 4 after explanation of all details examples of application of the method for another structural invariants have been published e g in bila et al 2000 2011 3 methodological details structural invariant approach to modeling of complex systems 3 1 structural invariants first structural invariants are structures not simple properties or numbers in bila 2011 bila et al 2000 2019 we have explored a few structural invariants e g m bm matroid bases of matroid dm rul dulmage mendelsohn decomposition set of evaluated rules alg trs algebra of transformations susy super symmetries in quantum physics structural invariants are considered as symbolical objects in symb that enabled us to detect an emergent situation by indicating their violation violation of a structural invariant that we register in symb indicates paes possible appearance of emergent situation that is in nat in the case of the structural invariant m bm its violation is represented by the extension of some basis of the matroid this extension can only be made by an element that comes from the outside of the matroid and which satisfies conditions of a concrete matroid basis in the next two sub sections we will show how emss can be detected using the structural invariant m bm 3 2 matroids and ramsey theory of graph when we use the notion of geometry in the system modeling we are always responsible for the suitability of the selected geometry geometry is not usually derived from the properties of the space but is assigned to it euclidean geometry geometry of hilbert space geometry of minkowki space and others we do not have this responsibility in the case of matroids that belong according to one of their representation to pre geometries the conditions introducing matroid concept use the definition of the set and two more definitions the relation of independence ind and the axiom of heridity no metric function no geometry it is remarkable how many knowledge have been derived from such a simple initial facts from matroid theory oxley 2001 we use here only the conceptual part and few related concepts as independence relation ind basis number of elements in the bases etc and several theorems that are in textbooks and which are not mentioned here however we implicitly work with them for the description of a complex system the relations of independence ind resp dependence dnt represent interactions between real elements of the modelled system the combination of matroid theory with ramsey theory of graph rtg makes these disciplines a very powerful tool first a few general facts a matroid is usually introduced oxley 2001 as the following structure 1 m x ind n 1 n 2 n n x mb where x is the ground set of elements components ind is a relation of independence n1 n2 nn are independent sets and mb is a set of matroid bases matroid bases are maximum according to cardinality independent sets in practical cases it is advantageous to use a dependence relation dnt as an example of dnt relation we introduce the following one relation is defined with regard to a problem factor α definition 3 1 elements x1 x2 x are dependent dnt x1 x2 α with regard to a given problem factor α if one or two three or four of the following conditions holds hold i elements x1 x2 associate each other respect to a given problem factor α in the same way or in similar way and principle taking into account elements from x expert criterion ii there are changes variations of x1 which are associated with changes variations in x2 or vv with regard to a given problem factor α and with regard to elements from x e g there exists a function x1 f x2 iii the application of x1 implies the application of x2 or vv with regard to a given problem factor α and with regard to elements from x e g x1 x2 iv the application of x1 excludes the application of x2 or vv with regard to a given problem factor α and with regard to elements from x e g x1 x2 examples of the problem factor phenomenon of floods fault in the system increase in temperature violation of the short water cycle note 3 1 there are of course other relations of dependence oxley 2001 for our conditions a simple theorem holds theorem 1 2 x 1 x 2 x n o t dnt x 1 x 2 a ind x 1 x 2 a before we formulate an essential rule for the detection of an emergent situation we describe a construction of matroid and its bases on a set x construction bases of matroid are formed on a squared matrix x x a basis is formed by an expert which responses the question are elements xi xj dependent respect to problem factor α according to definition def 1 dnt xi xj α if yes the corresponding field of matrix i j is fulfilled by 1 if not by 0 if the question is not relevant in the field will be according to theorem 1 above a basis of matroid is represented by elements of x for which holds 3 b x x n b x i 1 x im x ij x ik dnt x ij x ik a 0 for all j k 1 m an example of the construction of matroid and its bases is introduced in the appendix c theorem 2 4 b k b q m b b k b q all bases of the matroid have the same number of elements now we may form an essential sentence for the detection of an appearance of emergent situation an extension of a matroid basis by at least one element is considered in this paper as a violation of structural invariant m bm and it is considered as an internal indicator of a possible appearance of an emergent situation 3 2 1 extension of matroid basis it is clear that extending element elements must come from outside the original matroid in abstract space where is situated considered matroid it is enough to verify the relation ind however turning back to the reality of the emergent phenomenon this element must be semantically associated with real elements of the external description if we are working e g with problems of floods and we are searching for some real extending element it is clear that it cannot be for example ice cream this trivial condition must be provided by a man that constructs the extension the extension of the basis of the matroid from the technical point of view can be done by two ways m1 from the cardinality of the matroid we calculate the minimum number of elements that must be added to the matroid to have an extending element among them in detail in section 4 and in appendix c the number min δf rn is the minimal difference between the next ramsey number and the current ramsey number section 4 expression 14 ramsey number is introduced in nearest text m2 we find an extension element verifying the possibility of the extension of some basis ind section 4 expression 15 3 2 2 association with ramsey theorem weinstein 2018 if relation ind is considered as a binary relation the following consequences can be used the bases mb will be constructed as perfect sub graphs in a perfect graph each node is connected with all other nodes of x the independent and dependent elements in a perfect graph gp v e are easily constructed by coloring the edges of the complete graph by two colors and the formalism of ramsey numbers r b y b mb is offered for use we now introduce a free formulation of the relations on a perfect graph gp colored by two colors as a consequence of the famous ramsey theorem theorem 3 a perfect graph gp v e with n nodes where each edge belongs to class a or to class b contains a complete subgraph with a nodes and edges from class a or a complete subgraph with b nodes and edges from class b such a number r a b n is called a ramsey number historical note until now only some ramsey numbers rns are known e g r 3 3 6 r 3 4 9 r 3 5 14 r 3 6 18 r 3 15 73 78 r 4 4 18 r 4 11 96 191 r 6 10 177 1171 r 10 10 798 23 556 r 19 19 17 885 the brackets denote intervals of integer numbers in the calculations in section 4 we will use known table quantities from weinstein 2018 end of note let us turn back to representation of bases as perfect subgraphs with a small explication let us consider ramsey number r 3 4 9 ramsey theorem does not provide that dividing edges of the original perfect graph into dependent and independent edges we obtain 3 or 4 element basis but it could be so as with throwing a six walled dice there is no guarantee that a certain wall will appear at least once after six throws but this can happen note 3 2 the anonymity of ramsey theorem ramsey theorem responses the question how many elements but not which elements the method calculates the conditions that could lead to a possible appearance of an emergent situation however it does not construct the emergent situation itself 3 3 the power and complexity of the emergent phenomena the emergent phenomenon we describe in our view by two variables the power hp of emergent phenomenon and the complexity hcom of emergent phenomenon essential relations between the power hp and the complexity hcom are expressed by two equations 5 h p b 1 h p b u c h c o m b 6 h c o m b 1 h c o m b u h p b where b mb is a basis of a matroid and b 1 is the basis b extended by one element variables hp b hp b 1 and hcom b hcom b 1 are power and complexity of emergent phenomenon related to bases b and b 1 symbol u denotes the quotient of self organization of the considered complex system represented by a compartment and c is the limit of this quotient the best self organization quotient u c 0 1 represents intelligence of self organizing process that will execute the emergent phenomenon operating with eq 5 we obtain the contribution to power released by emergent phenomenon 7 δ h p b 1 u c h c o m b where δhp b 1 represents the registrable changes in the system associated with the emergent phenomenon and hcom b represents the complexity of the system of drivers that provide δhp b 1 the link between δhp b 1 and hcom b is provided by u c the intelligence quotient of the system the quantity of u c is done by rough estimations in table 1 and by soft tuning in appendix a as it will be seen in section 5 the value of u c is very sensitive and important for the result of application of expressions 5 6 7 the values introduced in table 1 are characteristic values for the corresponding classes of complex systems but not absolutely rigged for computation for example the value of u c for the first class of complex systems inanimate natural systems avalanches deserts floods earthquake and tsunami may alternate between 0 01 and 0 15 more adequate precise quantity is achieved by the procedure of soft tuning see appendix a the contribution to power of the emergent phenomenon δhp b 1 that is associated with hcom b by eqs 5 7 has its external representation δhd b 1 e g precipitation in a selected region appendix c measured by quantities of external variables symptoms si i 1 n for emergent siem and for nominal sinom situations 8 δ h d b 1 i 1 n w i s i e m s i n o m 2 1 2 f o r i 1 n 9 δ h d b 1 δ h d b 1 where ωi are quotients of importance and λ is a calibration constant the contribution to power of emergent phenomenon δhd b 1 results in a dimensionless real number expressed herein for example contribution for 20 is calculated as 120 100 1 2 eq 7 is associated with eq 5 where hcom is approximated in our case by number of elements of basis b i e b function ξ transforms real number δhp b 1 u c into nearest higher integer and holds 10 ξ δ h p b 1 u c b for explanation we describe a contribution δhd b 1 of power of a possible ems by approximating the emergent and nominal values of the selected variables in the compartment of real world conceptually these variables represent symptoms of the considered emergent phenomenon using calibration constant λ we find δhp b 1 then we form an abstract structure of drivers in the pre geometry space matroid and matroid bases and we compute by 10 the cardinality b 4 detecting emergent situations with help of m bm the description of the process with emergent situation that we want to indicate in the complex system compartment has the following form in nat and symb 11 nat synchronization of events or change of the structure of cs or s e paes 12 symb δ h p b 1 stru ctur al inva riant si vsi dete ction of paes where paes is a possible appearance of emergent situation si is a structural invariant vsi is a violation of structural invariant s e is something else and δhp b 1 is an aggregated result power of an emergent phenomenon detected in symb in the case that si is a matroid and its bases the following expression holds 13 symb δ h p b 1 x 1 mb 1 x 1 b 1 x 1 e 1 b 1 e 1 x 2 b 2 where x1 x2 are carriers of matroids mb1 is a set of bases on x1 b1 is a basis from mb1 e1 is a set of elements that extends x1 and e1 is an element that extends basis b1 into b2 example 4 1 x 1600 b 11 for x 1597 the threat of paes in nat is represented in symb with the addition of at least 40 elements that enable one element extension of the basis b 12 for x 1637 end of the example we formulate now a basic rule for analyzing detecting an emergent situation in relation with expression 13 as follows for case m1 sub section 3 2 paragraph extension of matroid basis 14 i f e 1 m i n δ f r n p a e s where e1 is a set that extends the matroid x1 mb1 13 and contains at least one element e1 extending basis b1 the number min δf rn is the minimal difference between the next ramsey number and the current ramsey number and paes denotes the possible appearance of an emergent situation the number δf rn provides that at least one element could be connected with relation ind with all elements of some basis from mb1 for case m2 sub section 3 2 paragraph extension of matroid basis 15 i f e i n d e x i x i b 1 p a e s where e is an extending element for which was verified independence ind to all elements of b1 4 1 normalization of δjf rn with regard to a real volume of added elements the following operation is actual for cases where the detecting of paes in pre geometry can be represented by the addition of real elements to the compartment of real world e g drivers in an ecosystem or the addition of a time interval to given time moment in other cases we don t have to do this because we don t know what s going on in the system in such cases we just transform the power of an emergent phenomenon into matroid pre geometry eqs 7 10 explain a method of the detection of paes without considering the actual volume of δhp b 1 however the actual state from which we calculate δj f rn corresponds to some number of active elements that is different from rn b in general the information about the current number of elements v b is a complementary information and it does not influence the calculation according eqs 14 15 the normalization procedure for the alternative m1 has the following steps let us assume that we have computed δhp b 1 eqs 7 9 from this number is possible to acquire b by eq 10 considering b as a number of elements of a basis we compute rn b this number corresponds to an actual state of the complex system and thus to a volume of elements in this state let us denote rn b corresponds to v b from this correspondence we extract a normalization quotient λ 16 λ v b r n b after computation rn b 1 we extrapolate the quantity v b 1 17 v b 1 λ rn b 1 then the value δf rn corresponds to value δv b b 1 the number of elements that is necessary to add to v b 18 δ v b b 1 λ δ f r n the normalization procedure for the alternative m2 is very easy however is not needed to introduce it here 4 2 summary of the whole process of analysis of an emergent situation in fig 1 the process starts with estimated values of symptoms sem snom representing the considered emergent phenomenon in an aggregated form δhp b 1 this value is transformed into the structural invariant in this case matroid and its bases m mb indicating violation of this invariant by the extension of some matroid base there is detected a possible appearance of emergent situation paes in fig 2 is seen the comparison of outputs from the physical model of floods with calculation of drivers of emergent phenomenon 4 2 1 physical model examples of inputs of floods in the selected compartment of the landscape precipitation structure of the network of mobile water carriers in the area rivers streams channels flows on water carriers structure of the network of water capacities lakes ponds structure of the setting of controllers of water carriers in the area gates sluices secondary waterways meteorological situations images of situations from radars that led did not lead to floods examples of outputs in the selected compartment of the landscape heights of raised water levels size of flooded areas number of destroyed buildings 4 2 2 calculation of emergent situations examples of some consequences associated with floods in the selected compartment of the landscape symptoms average and raised height of water levels in water carriers rivers brooks streams basins that interact in the considered region numbers of standard and affected buildings in danger of flooding in the considered region examples of drivers associated with floods are abstract drivers b b 1 δv b b 1 and concrete drivers water carriers participating in floods cracked dams of ponds water carriers involved in the flood floodgates in poor condition broken and rusted the block of calculation for emergent situations is not a model and it does not represent any causal relation it is a block of calculation 5 illustration of an application of the developed method extending deserts and violation of short water cycle so far we have mentioned two huge emergent situations in this context which have had an impact on the emergence of deserts and their simultaneous expansion global warming and the beginning of land drying our task and the aim of the article is to calculate under what conditions another emergent situation could occur associated with the development of deserts if we summarize our knowledge of the possibilities of modeling desertification from the introduction we are embarrassed neither the theory and hypotheses milankovitch theory bond s cycle fagan s the little ice age nor the overview of various desert expansion stories breckle et al 2002 give us an answer they don t even give instructions on the way let s go into the problem more deeply milankovitch theory bond s cycle describe rather continuous phenomena that have a cyclic character the evaluation of desert records breckle et al 2002 would most likely lead to statements such as in 10 years the atacama desert will advance 10 km at the southern end nothing about emergences nothing about a sudden dangerous change that comes with desert expansion we would expect for example within five years there will be strong hot waves in marrakech which input data could we get from the introduced hypotheses and theories only proxy data or none the task that classical research solves is different from what we describe in this article in the following sub section we will try to give an example of calculating the qualitative distance to the following emergence which is related to desert expansion the calculation is based on a simple description using very concentrated data and with transformation into a pre geometric space from where we get output knowledge 5 1 continuation of extension of deserts the model calculations 7 18 introduced in the previous sub sections leaded to a number of compartment elements that is necessary to add to a current number of compartment element to associate an emergent situation in the procedure of normalization these elements were represented by concrete divers in this sub section is illustrated the case when the difference between each two added elements represents a time unit and an elementary part of an oriented time scale the method of the transfer from the set of added elements to a time intervals was explained in bila et al 2019 the application of our method results in the time interval to the next possible appearance of emergent situation with regard to extension of deserts we use the following pilot data from the history a global warming before 11 700 years from now bond et al 1997 is considered global warming as one of the substantial emergences b the land drying began 6 000 years ago alverson et al 2003 wanner et al 2008 as the second substantial emergence it was a long term average trend with intermittently alternating dry and wet seasons we use for our computation only one dominant reliable fact a symptom discovered in year 2006 alverson et al 2003 deserts cover 47 million km2 of dry land this amounts to 35 of the land area of the world we will speak about a single world desert we denote the area of the desert da in time td as da td we consider two times td 2006 and time no desert nd in order to conserve the logic of modeling the development of the desert as a single desert of the world we introduce the following variable s 1 da td and for variables sem and snom s e m 1 d a 2006 1 0 35 1 35 s n o m 1 d a n d 1 0 1 if we consider that at the beginning of some paleoecological cycle there was no dry land then the corresponding contribution with calibration constant λ 1 according eq 9 to the power of the emergent phenomenon related to year 2006 is 19 δ h p b 1 i 1 1 w i s i e m s i n o m 2 1 2 s i e m s i n o m 1 35 1 1 35 only for checking the logic of the computation for time td nd we have δhp b 1 1 using table 1 we take u c 0 1 and by method in appendix a we calculate tuned quotient u c 0 1 and from 10 we compute the cardinality of a matroid basis 20 ξ δ h p b 1 u c b 14 we continue with determining rn 3 14 x 66 78 using the table in weinstein 2018 the next ramsey number is rn 3 15 x 73 78 from weinstein 2018 applying expression 14 21 i f e 1 m i n δ f r n p a e s we find the nearest ramsey numbers for b 14 rn 4 14 141 349 rn 5 14 221 and the nearest ramsey numbers for b 1 15 rn 4 15 153 417 rn 5 15 242 combinations of ramsey numbers for the selection of a minimal difference δf rn δf rn rn x 15 rn y 14 rn y 14 66 78 141 349 221 rn y 15 73 78 153 417 242 and we express rn x 15 rn y 14 in the sequence 22 73 66 78 66 78 78 153 141 note 5 1 the next differences δf rn are larger than the introduced differences and they have not been considered for detecting paes we use only two minimal differences from the sequence above δf rn 7 and δf rn 0 23 if e 1 7 or e 1 0 paes now we attempt to estimate the time for the appearance of the next emergent situation as was stated at the section 3 and at the beginning of this section we have access only to very unreliable data proxy data and at the same time we are using a combinatorial method that gives us results as a set of possibilities thus respecting a normalization analysis δv b b 1 λδf rn from expression 18 we have equations 24 δ f r n i r n 3 14 t n e x t p a e s t p r e v i o u s p a e s 25 λ t p r e v i o u s p a e s r n 3 14 26 t

the year 2006 in this context we may remind strong droughts in the central europe in years 2015 and 2018 buras et al 2020 the results for t next paes represent a qualitative distance from time 2006 the calculated numbers are very rough estimations of the next possible appearance of an emergent situation that could bring a possible change in the climate with regard to the extension of deserts 5 2 violation of short water cycle vswc the issues of periods of drought the history of droughts and extreme rainfall events in europe are addressed in great details in many articles e g ionita et al 2017 hanel et al 2018 svoboda et al 2017 our approach works with more integrated concepts such as short water cycle pokorny 2019 overheated landscape hesslerova et al 2018 air rivers makarieva and gorshkov 2007 hesslerova et al 2019 in this sub section we discover which properties are essential for the phenomenon of violation of the short water cycle vswc could be one of the factors of desertification with regard to various causes of desertification from the introduction we introduce a rough scheme of dehydration of land s point small precipitation drying of vegetation decreased evapotranspiration increase of temperature drying landscape no precipitation s point the introduced cycle was confirmed e g in hesslerova et al 2019 where the principal effect of temperature increase on landscape dehydration was related to the destruction of forests makarieva and gorshkov 2007 this sequence is associated with a key question why did not rain at the beginning of this loop we propose the following reasons a the principle reason lies in some global effect e g in the milankovitch effect kutzbach et al 1985 b the atmospheric humidity has gone to some other place vswc bila et al 2011 why a possible response for b the basic reason consisted in the establishment of potential fields of temperatures and pressures in the atmosphere of segments of dry land when there was a homogeneous field of temperature and pressure without none differences there was no potential inducing motion after the formation of at least two segments of dry land with significantly high differences of temperatures and pressures the transport layer in the atmosphere attempted to equalize these differences formation of potential differences of physical variables is a natural phenomenon and if we would consider it as a starting process of desertification then the desertification of the earth is also a natural phenomenon other way how to explain the above question is the influence of a positive feedback between kernel variables paper bila et al 2011 presented a model of the situation of a violation of the so called short water cycle in a selected ecosystem the trebon basin in south bohemia czech republic the short water cycle swc refers to the behavior of the local ecosystem e g the trebon region in which the volume of water that enters the ecosystem is evaporated condensed and falls back into the system as the precipitation in more details it means vegetation is cooled by the vapor of water the air above the vegetation has high relative humidity rises slowly upwards and after a few hundred meters reaches the dew point clouds form and rain in the afternoon from a thousand liters of water vapor one liter of liquid water is generated and the heat is released rising upwards with expired dry air flowing into the ocean to pick up new water with the rain the pressure has decreased and the moist air from the surrounding area is attracted horizontally if there is enough vegetation forest so the moist air is attracted all the way from the sea reasons for violation of swc are many but the most natural is the following one if we drain the landscape and cut down the forests the landscape is overheated it is not cooled by the vapor of water from the heated surfaces heats the air which rises rapidly upwards several meters per second this air has low relative humidity it is heated but it contains water vapor from the remains of the forest ponds and it rises too high before reaching the dew point the water falls at best somewhere in the mountains in the worse up to the ocean that is the principle of drying out by air rivers which occurs in an overheated landscape this phenomenon is probably occurring now in the třeboň basin in our country the landscape is overheated due to lack of water and vegetation not as a result of high concentrations of co2 the calculation of drivers which influence on the violation of short water cycle is done in appendix c 6 discussion in this section we cover only two points of view a what was not introduced and not regarded in the paper b what could be controversial a1 there are almost no measurements in the article especially measurements of some typically ecological and meteorological variables such as pressure temperature humidity there are two reasons for this on the one hand values of quantities used in the calculations are quantities of general validity and they are presented in scientific papers without further experimental evidence e g soil drying on earth began about 6000 years ago or for analysis of desert development on earth we have so called proxy data not deeper than 250 years ago or since the beginning of the drying of the soil on earth almost 35 2006 of the total land area has been converted to desert or dry soil these data are almost qualitative in nature and have a high degree of uncertainty however the formalism used in the calculations and the conclusions obtained also lead to qualitative results if we use measured values for calculations they are related to locally limited areas compartments e g in appendix c these values have the character of average values related to a certain time interval and again lead to qualitative results a2 in the article we do not address the problem of ecosystem management in order to improve the situation for example to eliminate swc violation at the end of appendix c it was stated that one of the strategies of such control would be to eliminate the actions of all found drivers that lead to vswc although we have a list of such drivers it is not clear how they interact each other and the proportions in which they should be effective in improving the situation at the same time we state that due to the weak causality of a complex ecosystem sugihara et al 2012 westoby et al 1989 it is not possible to calculate these proportions in principle b1 symptom selection when calculating the contribution to power of the emergent phenomenon δhp b 1 we work with a certain selection of symptoms and their nominal and emergent values coefficients for individual symptoms in the eq 8 are obtained either by the saaty method saaty 1978 or by sensitivity analysis according to eq 7 the hcom b complexity value can be calculated to the given contribution of the power of emergent phenomenon when choosing symptoms the main rule is to cover the process of emergent phenomenon as for other complex systems there is necessary to collaborate with experts for example if we characterize the emergent phenomenon of flash floods fig 2 and lit qiuling yao et al 2016 we cannot forget about the average of the water level stroke and the number of buildings affected on the contrary we do not need to indicate the number of sandbags that were used in the construction of improvised small dams near the affected buildings b2 coefficient u c coefficient u c plays an important role in the eq 7 and in the derived calculations this so called coefficient of intelligence characterizes the environment in which the emergent phenomenon takes place the closer this environment is to the inanimate phase e g desert sand compared to the living phase swarm of bees the lower the coefficient u c is and the more elements in our additive representation of drivers see b3 it is necessary to deploy to achieve a given performance of the emergent phenomenon table 1 shows the indicative values of the coefficient u c obtained empirically and means nothing more than that the coefficients of intelligence of all possible complex systems are distributed over a real closed interval 0 1 for especially mixed complex systems there may be a debate as to whether the values u c should be different especially because and for the role played by the coefficient u c in our method the article is equipped with appendix a which correlates the type of complex system with the method of calculating complexity size u c was studied at work bila 2014 b3 search for drivers both in sub section 5 1 and especially in appendix c we look for the specific content of drivers to the calculated complexity of the system represented here by the number of main drivers the number of elements of a matroid basis once again we are getting to the empirical level surface and with the help of an expert we are looking for quantities and operators that could have a significant influence on the behavior of the ecosystem and on the emergent phenomenon violating the small water cycle the only formal feature that we check when expanding some of the found basis of the matroid is the independence ind of the extending element to the elements of that basis if we find this element driver right away we do not need to solve anything further case m2 in section 4 the second case of extending the base m1 in section 4 consists in finding and adding δf rn drivers from the given area to the original matroid adding δf rn drivers to the matroid carrier induces the possibility of attaching at least one element that would extend some basis we are speaking about an additive representation of drivers 7 conclusions in this article we focused on one important phenomenon that change the face of the planet desertification we talked about the desertification of the planet as a process associated with two fundamental emergent phenomena global warming and soil drying in classical science analyzing the phenomenon of desertification requires an enormous amount of data documenting all possible influences and dependencies we did not use this path in which the physical approach prevails not only for lack of suitable data but mainly for the method of data synthesis in this article we used a method based on the violation of so called structural invariants which replaced weak volumes of observation and data with constructions in the pre geometric space the article led to two results the first result was the calculation of the time for the next possible appearance of an emergent situation associated with desert expansion the second result was the discovery of factors and parameters that influence on the violation of the so called short small water cycle these factors and parameters are presented in an integral form and cover a large volume of partial influences e g parameter decrease of quality of vegetation cover of landscape entails the extirpation of forests the drying of wetlands the construction of new reflecting areas car parks etc the article remains at the level of analysis and does not give a solution to the phenomenon of

complexity of the compartment of the complex system given by the number of a matroid basis hcom b b the procedure for calculating and determining the coefficient u c is based on the following limitations and conditions a1 u c 0 1 a2 δ h p b 1 0 1 a3 b z procedure for computation of u c s1 first is computed δhp b 1 resp δhd b 1 s2 fulfilling condition u c 0 1 for orientation is possible to use estimations from table 1 is chosen the quantity b s3 in the list of ramsey numbers 28 we find numbers r 3 b r 4 b r r1 b numbers r b are sometimes given as subsets on the interval r1 r2 and r1 r2 z s4 we find the nearest numbers r 3 b 1 r 4 b 1 r r2 b 1 s5 we compute combinations of ramsey numbers for the selection of a minimal difference a4 δ f r n r n x b 1 r n y b so we find numbers rn y b p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 and rn x b 1 q1 q2 q3 q4 q5 and we express the sequence q1 p1 q1 p2 q2 p2 q2 p3 q3 p3 s6 from this sequence is computed δ1f rn min q1 p1 q1 p2 q2 p2 q2 p3 q3 p3 s7 we turn back to step s2 and we select another u c fulfilling condition a s8 we continue till the step s6 and compute δ2f rn min s9 this procedure from s7 to s8 is repeated as many times as possible until the variability of the sequence δ1f rn δkf rn is seen s10 the best value of the quotient u c is a number for which we found a5 m i n δ 1 f r n δ k f r n s11 for this value of u c we solve eq 7 from sub section 6 3 and we continue in the method appendix b complex systems and emergent situations complex systems have certain properties that differentiate them from other systems the following features are examples of such properties that have already been classified bila 2014 another list of properties is introduced e g in petty 2014 many elements in mutual interactions multidimensionality quasi stability in state changes nonlinear characteristics self organizing processes emergent behavior motions at the border of chaos nonstochastic future there is no necessary to illustrate that complex ecosystems have the most of the introduced features the description of the most characteristics except emergent behavior and self organization leads to a physical approach section 5 before we introduce two types of emss we introduce some general properties of emergent phenomena and emergent situations a even if we know the causes of situations and they can be simulated there may be discovered something that has not yet occurred and looks like emergence this can be seen in generative systems this will be called in this paper as the actual emergent situation emsa for a true emergent situation emst we do not know the causes b emergence has no goal if we do not know the goal it cannot be simulated it would not be possible to check if the simulation has reached the correct goal c true emergent situations are unpredictable ones d since some ems are seen theoretically for the first time and unprepared we cannot use the pre prepared observational and symbolical tools as we know it from physics in this process we must distinguish between the behavioral side of the emergent phenomenon and the symbolical side of emergent phenomenon e g we see the soliton in the water canal and we had not seen anything similar before we capture its behavior e g by a photograph as a reflection of the natural phenomenon then at home we can find in books or in the internet what solitons are and we use for their description corresponding equations ffor further reading we reming symbols nat and tsymb introduced in section 2 the overview of the proposed method in works bila 2014 2017 have been introduced 3 classes of emergent situations a b c in this paper we need only types b and c emergent situations class b b1 the causes of these situations are not known in nat but their output forms are known b2 the situation appears suddenly without an explicit association with situations in the previous relevant time space context of the system b3 in the mind of a human observer the situation appears as a meaningful image situated in nat e g as a behavior behavior of a group of termites as a process tsunami traffic jam on the highway as a property super conductivity b4 it does not matter whether the ems has been induced by the coincidence of events or by a sudden change in the complex system structure in nat or by something else in all such cases the ems can be detected as a change of the structure or the violation of structural invariant in level symb using structural invariant approach however it may be registered only as a possible appearance of emergent situation paes b5 the detailed reasons and the internal causes of the appearance of the true emergent situation emst are not known in nat and therefore is impossible to propose a complete prediction model in symb but we are able to form a detection model for paes using structural invariant approach situations belonging to this class include a change in behavior strategy in a swarm colony bila 2014 the appearance of floods emsa and emst bila 2014 yao et al 2016 the appearance of rough waves in the ocean emst the appearance of traffic jams on the highway emsa and emst and desertification of the landscape and of the earth emst emergent situations of class c situations in this class have the same properties as the situations from class b except item b1 instead we formulate condition c1 c1 the causes of these situations are not known and their output forms are also not known no model of a situation of this kind is available before it first operates situations that belong to this class include unforeseen instabilities in ecosystems emst emergent events on the sun the appearance of artifacts in nano structures emst as for situations b and c we note that complex systems with emergences show weak causality for some events it is not possible to determine what is the result of what e g the emergent situation great drought in central europe in summer of 2018 buras et al 2020 we do not know if it was a disorder that could have its consequences or if it was a result of a disorder that we have not registered appendix c case study for violation of swc vswc in south bohemia czech republic now we demonstrate application of our method in the calculation of divers for vswc the result of the method application will be the discovery and suggestion of new factors drivers that influence on swc using a conceptual relation between symptoms and drivers section 2 the following symptoms quantified for the selected area in the landscape and for one representative year have been operated s1

trebon basin the following calculation expresses a general situation what if in form which drivers and how influence on the given contribution to emergent phenomenon the calculus for the emergent situation in a complex system which was introduced in sub section 3 3 associates two variables for the emergent situation the power and the complexity first the contribution to the power is computed

elements drivers of some basis c 10 b ξ 1 316 0 44 ξ 2 990 3 it leads to matr oid with x 6 i e rn b 6 with help of our landscape expert we find 6 possible drivers that influence on the life of the ecosystem and violate swc considered as the elements of x x1 high velocity of flowing in transport level of atmosphere 200 m above the landscape surface x2 high level of sun radiation x3 decrease of quality of vegetation cover of landscape x4 small water absorption capacity of the soil x5 decrease of volume of ground water x6 wrong chemical composition of bed layer of the soil exploring the matrix in table 1c with regard to relation dnt xi xj α and according theorem 1 sub section 3 2 we find bases of the matroid a legend for table 1c dnt xi xj α 1 xi is dependent on xj with regard to problem factor α dnt xi xj α 0 xi is independent on xj with regard to problem factor α in case dnt xi xj α question about dependency xi on xj is non relevant the problem factor α was formulated as supports the violation swc in table 1c are discovered two bases b1 b2 c 11 b 1 x 1 x 3 x 6 c 12 b 2 x 1 x 2 x 6 this indicates that the basic reasons for vswc are b1 high velocity of the flow in the transport level of the atmosphere a decrease in the quality of the vegetation cover of the landscape wrong chemical composition of the bed layer of the soil b2 high velocity of the flow in the transport level of the atmosphere a high level of solar radiation wrong chemical composition of the bed layer of the soil the last action that needs to be done is to find at least one driver that may extend the discovered bases the nearest ramsey number rn b 1 is 9 so we try to find three drivers that support the violation of swc α and at least one of them may extend bases b1 b2 i e will be independent to their elements three such drivers could be x7 increasing number and influence of air rivers x8 an increase of anthropogenic effects in the region e g industrial activities x9 long term local dry atmosphere arid soil note c 1 the concept and function of air rivers have been described at the beginning of sub section 5 2 from these three effects x8 and probably x7 may extend b1 and b2 and they are associated with paes violation of swc c 13 b 1 x 1 x 3 x 6 x 8 c 14 b 1 x 1 x 3 x 6 x 7 c 15 b 2 x 1 x 2 x 6 x 8 c 16 b 2 x 1 x 2 x 6 x 7 all discovered drivers support a positive feedback introduced at the beginning of this sub section s point small precipitation drying of vegetation decreased evapotranspiration increase of temperature drying landscape no precipitation s point from the theory of systems is known that such a positive feedback is very hard to control what is possible to do is to cut the line there could be suggested places marked by such a cut means to apply activities of repression i e activities negating decreased evapotranspiration for example to decrease the velocity of flowing in transport level of atmosphere e g in case that the main reason is some anthropogenic influence e g nuclear power station to increase the quality of vegetation cover of landscape to improve the water absorption capacity of the soil to increase the number of water carriers streams lakes ponds the importance of the introduced results has been confirmed as very relevant in the context of climate change all these introduced changes are trivial to understand and they belong to factors of co evolution of the landscape and in large they belong to factors of co evolution of earth fig 1c illustrates situation in the sumava national park in south bohemia the influence of drivers from b1 and b2 has been confirmed violation of swc induced drying the trees this was followed by an invasion of wood parasite ips typographus the next phase is the development of a landscape similar to desert note c 2 this example is introduced here as a reconstruction of a past event however the paes could have been detected at least 10 years ago appendix d related works in the next small overview we focus attention only on three fields related to this paper a complex systems and emergent situations modeling of complex ecosystems b causality in modeling complex ecosystems with emergences c desertification of the earth and the ecological modeling a complex systems and emergent situations the basic concept of complex system does not differ from the concept of the system set of elements bonds between them and mutual interactions however the deeper analysis of complex systems discovered some peculiar properties that are very substantial for their identification and control e g quasi stability in state changes nonlinear characteristics self organizing processes etc it was explained in detail in appendix b moving in the border between physics and cybernetics is good to remind opinions of robert b laughlin concentrated e g in book a different universe reinventing physics from the bottom down laughlin 2006 laughlin introduces emergence as an organization principle and from this point of view explores a wide field of physics the sources of the theory of complex systems that was introduced in appendix b have their background e g in petty 2014 bila 2014 kauffman 1993 reid 2007 laughlin 2006 morgan 1929 these sources are introduced here only for information and as a preface for modeling of complex ecosystems modeling of complex ecosystems typical models that use physical approach are e g rodriguez et al 2019 viola et al 2010 to these models belong also the works focusing problems of drought and precipitation e g ionita et al 2017 hanel et al 2018 svoboda et al 2017 these works are important for the problem of earth desertification however only partially the desertification is the evolutionary process not only water and drought process the authors rodriguez et al 2019 introduce as a best formal tool for modeling of complex ecosystems the thermodynamics beside such models there were developed ecosystems models that introduce special formal tools and that emphasize mainly systemological issues such approaches and models are e g conceptual ecological models and diagrams cmd noon 2002 system ecological models sed odum 2002 with the increase of power of informatic tools we may observe the effort for the synthesis of some manageable integrated models of an ecosystem as an integrated environmental model we name e g not just new system siat verweij et al 2010 these models could be adapted for studies of the progress of desertification but a great deal of additional data will be needed this was the reason why we have not used these models and we concentrated our attention on the development of an own method for the topic of this paper are substantial papers about the short water cycle ripl 1995 hesslerová et al 2018 and a characterization of naturalness alkemade et al 2009 of landscape including temperature fluctuations it is necessary to emphasize that the short water cycle and its violation have their substance in ecology and not in hydrology though it seems to be near of water issues with pleasure we name here the works that have been inspired by situation in sought bohemia czech republic e g kravcik et al 2008 hesslerova et al 2018 that describe the swc b causality in modeling complex ecosystems with emergences for this paper is very relevant work cottam et al 1998 with clear thesis emergence half a quantum jump and papers hannisdal and liow 2018 sugihara et al 2012 that attack the essence of causality and its contribution to predicting system development the emergence is discussed in work cottam et al 1998 as a basic evolutionary operation in paper hannisdal and liow 2018 the authors have investigated a large area of resources based on granger s concept of causality and the concept of causality in dynamic systems finally they focus on the analysis of paleontological time series and more specifically refer to three approaches stochastic differential equations convergent cross mapping transfer of entropy in works hannisdal and liow 2018 sugihara et al 2012 is seen the effort not to go beyond the field of classical mathematics including the assumption about ordering and enumerating emergent phenomena this assumption does not hold in our approach and therefore the mathematical apparatus used in this paper is different from formal means used in hannisdal and liow 2018 sugihara et al 2012 the mathematical background used in our paper is covered in bila 2014 2017 oxley 2001 weinstein 2018 saaty 1978 the most important knowledge from these sources is a conceptual part of theory of matroids combined with essential knowledge from ramsey theory of graph c desertification of the earth and the ecological modeling there are a few of theories that map the reasons of earth s desertification e g changing earth position and movement within the framework of our planetary system e g declinations in the orbit of the earth kutzbach et al 1985 other reasons are hidden in the alternation of wet and dry phases in the earth s climate bond et al 1997 or in some unpredictable changes in earth climate fagan 2001 further works following global changes of earth were introduced in the introduction the great overview of sources in desertification research together with initial insight into problems have been done in breckle veste and wucherer 2002 unfortunately not too many works are devoted in ecological modeling of desertification and if some they are limited to some landscape region from this field we may introduce tamzen et al 2003 peters et al 2012 veron et al 2010 each of these models focuses on special characteristics of desertification e g the model veron et al 2010 confirms the influence of vegetation response on the desertification process 
24531,the fast growing chinese economy consumes large amounts of energy and thus incurs high air emissions the interactions between chinese economy energy and its air environmental cost are worth further exploring for promoting the sustainability of the country to this end several indicators based on currency energy and emergy are constructed to depict the interrelations between the three factors during 1989 2016 and then a vector autoregressive var model is adopted to forecast the trends of these interactions in the future it is found that 1 chinese energy efficiency increases by 62 24 2 air environmental cost per unit energy use decreases by 39 46 3 air environmental cost per unit economic output decreases by 77 14 4 structure coordination degree increases by 18 14 times 5 scale harmony degree decreases by 2 70 6 china s energy consumption significantly enhances its economic growth and air environmental cost and china s economic growth also very clearly promote its air environmental cost 7 chinese energy consumption will obviously promote its economic growth before 2022 and china s economic growth and energy use will clearly raise the air environmental cost before 2019 chinese government should further promote coordination between economy energy and air environmental protection in the future graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chinese economy energy consumption air environmental cost indicator var model 1 introduction economic development based on fossil energy depletion and environmental pollution has been widely criticized wu and ning 2018 human beings have being exploiting fossil energy sources to meet their growing energy demands for the economic growth lots of fossil fuels combustion leads to the greenhouse effect acid rain and other local environmental pollution nicoletti et al 2015 china known as the largest world s factory tang et al 2015 is also the world s largest country in terms of its energy consumption and co2 carbon dioxide emissions chinese fossil energy demand has reached unprecedented levels since 2015 zhang et al 2017 and thus caused serious environmental problems which is challenging its sustainable development shuai et al 2017 china s economy rose by an annual growth rate of 6 66 during 2015 2019 while its energy consumption still climbed by an annual increase rate of 2 92 in the same period national bureau of statistics of china 2020 although so2 nox and particle pollutant decreased by an annual decline rate of 29 58 9 64 and 8 28 respectively during this period ministry of ecological environment of the people s republic of china 2020 it is still a huge challenge for chinese government to control total emissions of co2 and air pollutants while keeping economic growth therein one of the most intractable issues lies in simultaneously mitigating emissions of air pollutants pm2 5 o3 and ghgs greenhouse gasses lu et al 2020 at present only 10 of cities in the country have truly realized coordination between their environment protection and economic development j wang et al 2015 therefore it is still urgent to deeply explore the relationships between economy energy and the environment in the country yuan et al 2015 and then find out related countermeasures to promote decoupling of economic growth and energy consumption and environmental emissions impact for its sustainable development in the long run 2 literature review in recent years many scholars have explored interactions between economy energy and the environment in different countries he and lin 2018 investigated time varying effects of cyclical fluctuations in china s energy industry on the macro economy and carbon emissions through combining principal component analysis and a time varying parameter structural var model and they found that cyclical changes in the energy industry lagged fluctuations in the macroeconomic environment and the effect of energy shocks on carbon emissions has gradually weakened over time but ignorance of local environmental emissions in their study could lead to incomplete policy making information for coordinating relationships between energy economy and the environment x zhang et al 2014 explored the interaction between chinese economy energy consumption and air emissions impacts using their proposed indicator system based on energy currency and emergy and put forward the related policy implications but they did not considered air environmental capacity and thus reduced accuracy of air emissions impact results abbasi and riaz 2016 explored the influence of economic and financial development on carbon emissions in pakistan during 1970 2011 using an augmented var approach they found that the financial variables played a role in emission mitigation only in the latter period and the increasing emissions impact from rising per capita incomes greatly exceeded the relative magnitude of emissions mitigation derived from financial variables however ignorance of energy consumption and local environmental emissions could lead to incomplete information for coordinating relationship between economic development and environmental protection chen and xu 2017 investigated relationship between air quality and economic development in the provincial capital cities of china using regression analysis based on ekcs and provided a meaningful reference for policy makers however absence of energy consumption could not discover the underlying driving force lin and wang 2019 explored inconsistency of economic growth and electricity consumption in china during 2000 2016 using a panel var approach and their results explain the reasons for inconsistency and identify the key factors but other energy sources except electricity and environmental emissions have not been considered yet and thus more adequate information for promoting social economic sustainability is lacking fan and hao 2020 investigated the relationship amongst renewable energy consumption economic growth and foreign direct investment in china and their results showed that there is a long term and stable equilibrium relationship between gross domestic products per capita foreign direct investment per capita and renewable energy consumption per capita but neglect of environmental emissions could not provide comprehensive information for policy making nowadays it has been found that more scholars have shown interest in investigation of relationship and interaction between co2 emissions and social economic development using econometric approach and related methods therein umar et al 2020 examined the long run and causal effects of innovation financial development and transportation infrastructure on co2 emissions in china from 1971 to 2018 using the combined cointegration and wavelet coherence approaches adebayo and akinsola 2021 explored the causal linkage between co2 emissions economic growth and energy consumption in thailand utilizing the wavelet coherence approach conventional granger and the toda yamamoto causality techniques he et al 2021 explored the impact of financial development and globalization on consumption based carbon emissions in mexico while controlling growth trade openness and energy consumption using the dual adjustment approach adebayo et al 2021 studied the relationship between urbanization co2 emissions gross capital formation energy use and economic growth in south korea between 1965 and 2019 using recent econometric techniques orhan et al 2021 assessed the linkage between co2 emissions and economic growth while considering the role of energy consumption agriculture and trade openness in india between 1965 and 2019 using the bayer and hanck cointegration and gradual shift causality tests and the wavelet coherence test soylu et al 2021 applied the wavelet tools and the gradual shift causality test to the interactions between co2 emissions and renewable energy economic growth trade openness and energy usage in china between 1965 and 2019 zhang et al 2021 explored the long run and causal impact of economic growth financial development urbanization and gross capital formation on malaysia s co2 emissions using maki cointegration and wavelet coherence tests and so on these studies provided related beneficial suggestions for policy makers to coordinate relationship between economic development and co2 emissions however other air emissions except co2 have not been considered which could not provide full policy making information for sustainable development of social economy generally when evaluating causal relationships between economy energy and environmental emissions the gap of existing research includes relatively single environmental emissions considered generally co2 and ignoring differences of diverse emissions impacts on human and the environment derived from accounting approach based on material flow analysis so information of environmental emissions and their impacts is incomplete and superficial to evaluating emissions impacts on human health and the environment more objectively some scholars have carried out related studies therein x zhang et al 2014 quantified emissions impacts through accounting ecological service needed to dilute pollutants to their legal limits and environmental cost derived from pollutants harm to human health in terms of emergy however they have not considered related environmental capacity yet which led to overestimation of emissions impacts all abovementioned defects could lead to somewhat distorted results for decision making li et al 2021 quantified environmental benefits of old community renewal in nanjing of china using emergy analysis and then provided some beneficial suggestions and these studies highlight advantages of emergy analysis over other related methods due to consideration of environmental contribution and quantity differences of diverse environmental factors when quantifying environmental cost caused by emissions the ema can measure impacts of different types of emissions in terms of a common unit liu et al 2011 odum 1996 however as an effective means of communicating natural systems and economic systems this environmental accounting method has not been combined with some popular economic methods in practical application which makes many issues hard to be fully explained for example ema can be applied to analysis of the overall operation status and evolution trend of the eco economic system but it seems powerless in the face of such problems as what kind of interaction mechanism and causality exist between the natural system and social economy therefore in order to providing more complete and clear information for decision making for one complex system composed of economy and energy and the environment it is necessary to set up one set of indicator system composed of economy energy the environment related factors so as to fully describe their interactions meanwhile other factors should be also considered when calculating the environmental cost for enhancing the reasonability of accounting results such as environmental capacity biodiversity hazards and so on furthermore in order to reveal the related underlying reasons one should explore the causal relationship between the three factors through combining econometrics methods and other measurement tools and methods x h zhang et al 2014 over the past twenty years chinese government gradually implemented energy saving and emission reduction policies and achieved some improvements tilt 2019 especially since 2000 chinese government has implemented a serial of circular economy related policies to promote resource saving and environmental protection in its economic development j zhu et al 2019 however it is not clear how these policies and measures affect the interrelations between chinese economy and energy and air emissions impacts therefore it is necessary to quantify the impacts of air emissions on the ecological system and human health and then reveal the interactions and mutual causality between chinese economy energy and air emissions impacts and predict the future trends so as to provide useful information for policy makers to promote high quality development of chinese economy characterized as low energy use and low air environmental cost this paper investigates the relationships between chinese economic growth and energy use and its air environmental cost during 1989 2016 and then explores the causal relationships between the three factors so as to find out related obstacles hindering chinese economy decoupling with energy use and air environmental cost for policy making therein the atmospheric environmental cost is firstly quantified in terms of emergy then several indicators based on currency and energy and emergy is founded to depict the relationships between economy energy and environment cost and finally a var model is adopted to reveal the mutual causality between economy energy air environmental cost and further forecast the future trends of interactions of the three factors in the next fifteen years the approach was adopted in this study due to 1 emergy method considering the environmental contribution to economy and its common measurement based on objective standard 2 improved quantification of emissions impacts through considering environmental capacity and 3 var quantifying causal relationship between economy energy and emissions impacts the novelty of this work lies in 1 its consideration of environmental capacity when quantifying emissions impacts in terms of emergy and 2 setting up several indicators based on currency and energy and emergy to characterize the compound system composed of economy and energy and the environment and 3 exploring the interactions and mutual causality between chinese economy and energy and the air environmental cost with updating data using the var model by doing so this work can fill in the existing knowledge gap in the literature through 1 improving the existing emergy amounting approach of emissions impacts by considering related environmental capacities and pollutants harm to biological ingredients 2 exploring the underlying obstacles affecting the harmony between china s economy energy and the atmospheric environment from a novel viewpoint which can complement the existing studies and then provide more sufficient decision information for policy makers and 3 the presented indicators and methods can also act as one of policy making tools for other countries in the world for coordinating the relationships between their economy energy and atmospheric environmental protection next section 3 introduces the adopted methods and indicator system the data sources and the statistic tools the research results are provided in section 4 and discussions and policy implications are implemented in section 5 finally section 6 summarizes the main conclusions 3 methods 3 1 quantifying air environmental cost here air environmental cost is quantified in units of emergy emergy is defined as the quantity of one kind of energy contained in one flow or stored energy odum 1996 in practical applications solar energy solar emjoules abbreviated as sej is often used as a measure unit lan et al 2002 emergy baseline as the reference when implementing an emergy evaluation is the sum of the annual emergy input of solar radiation tidal energy and geothermal energy on the earth brown and ulgiati 2016 there are five emergy benchmarks in existing emergy related research i e 9 44e 24 sej yr odum 1996 9 26e 24 sej yr campbell 1998 15 83e 24 sej yr odum et al 2000 15 20e 24 sej yr brown and ulgiati 2010 and 12 00e 24 sej yr brown et al 2016 this study adopts the latest emergy benchmark 12 00e 24 sej yr due to its improved accuracy here the air environmental cost includes the human health loss and the ecosystem loss 3 1 1 human health loss caused by air emissions air emissions could influence human health through many ways when exceeding their related environmental capacity which is mainly derived from their migration and transformation in atmospheric environment daly disability adjusted life year put forward by world health organization has been widely adopted to measure the impact of air emissions on human health hofstetter 1998 goedkoop and spriensma 2001 the decrease of daly means the loss or reduction of the health life years of human beings or the years of their disability due to the emissions influence human health loss caused by environmental emissions can be quantified in units of emergy because human health is supported through consumption of all resources and energy sources which can be measured by emergy use based on the comprehensive consideration of the atmospheric environmental capacity of china in the past 30 years xu et al 2018 this study calculates the human health loss caused by so2 nox and dust using formula 1 here atmospheric environmental capacity is defined as follows for a given volume in atmosphere and time interval when pollutant generation source and removal sink reach a balance the pollutant concentration maintains a specified value threshold concentration and the rate of pollutant generation emission is defined as the atmospheric environmental capacity under the threshold concentration therefore atmospheric environmental capacity expresses the balance between pollutant emissions and their removal at specified pollutant concentrations compared with those studies ignoring environmental capacity here consideration of environmental capacity could reasonably assess air emissions adverse influence on human health and ecological systems because air emissions have no adverse effect on human health and ecological systems when being within related environmental capacities 1 f 1 a i r i 1 n m i m e i d a l y i π h j where f1 air is the total human health loss derived from air emissions sej yr mi stands for the mass of the i th air pollutant kg yr here i 1 2 3 mei is environmental capacity of the i th air pollutant representing the 30 year recurrence period in china kg yr table 1 dalyi is the related daly value of the i th air pollutant yr kg table 2 τh j is per capita emergy consumption in the j th year sej person yr and it is calculated using the formula 2 2 π h j g d p j r e m j p o p j where gdpj is the real gdp in the j th year based on 1978 cny yr popj is the total population in the j th year remj stands for ratio of emergy to money sej cny in the j th year and it is calculated according to the formula 3 based on the linear correlation of rems of different years in one country according to ref campbell et al 2014

2000 2004 and 2008 respectively cny yr in the calculation process the rems from 1989 to 1999 are calculated through the extension method the lacking rem values during 2000 2008 are attained through the interpolation method and the rem values from 2009 to 2016 are estimated using the extension method based on the data during 2000 2008 3 1 2 ecosystem loss caused by air emissions the air emissions could also destroy the biological ingredients in the natural ecosystem when their environmental capacity is lacking jun 2006 then ecological balance could be destroyed and then cause potential loss to human society therefore it is necessary to account for air emissions harm to the ecosystem the reasonability i e why ecosystem loss caused by air emissions can be quantified in terms of emergy could be explained as follows ecosystem is supported by various ecological elements besides energy however various ecological elements supporting ecosystem are finally supported by one kind of energy i e solar energy measured in sej in fact here emergy is different from general term energy because it reflects one memory of energy during the course of form of a kind of output therefore here emergy analysis differs from traditional energy analysis because it includes many complicated natural and artificial transformation processes which has been described and explained in detail by odum ht and other related scholars the specific impact can be measured by the following formula 4 f 2 a i r u e v s l i 1 n m i m e i s l i where f2 air is emergy loss derived from harm of air emissions to the ecosystem sej yr uevsl represents the unit emergy of a species sej species yr and it is equal to the global emergy baseline 12 00e 24 sej yr brown and ulgiati 2016 divided by the total number of species of 1 00e12 on earth locey and lennon 2016 i e 1 20e13 sej species yr mi represents the mass of the i th pollutant discharged kg yr sli represents the potential loss of species caused by per unit mass of the i th air pollutant species yr kg shown in table 3 3 2 the indicator system being adopted relationships between economy energy and the environment could be described by intensity indicators structural index and scale index here intensity indicators mainly include energy use per unit of gdp environmental cost per unit of energy use and environmental cost per unit of energy use structural index refers to structural coordination degree and scale index means scale harmony degree and they can be founded based on currency energy and emergy and explained as follows energy use per unit of gdp eupg kg standard coal cny it is defined as the total energy use divided by the gdp in a year x zhang et al 2014 which has been widely applied to measurement of the energy efficiency of the economic development in different regions and countries the larger indicator value means the lower energy efficiency of the economic development environmental cost per unit of energy use ecpe sej kg standard coal after industrial revolution energy sources especially fossil energy sources are both driving force of economic growth and derivation of environmental impacts here ecpe was proposed to describe environmental cost caused by energy use and it is defined as the total environmental cost divided by the total energy use in a year x zhang et al 2014 this indicator reflects the impact of energy consumption on the environment meanwhile it also indirectly reflects the efficiency of energy use the bigger indicator value means the greater environmental pollution intensity from energy consumption or indirectly reflects the lower energy efficiency environmental cost per unit of gdp ecpg sej cny since industrial revolution environmental impact of economic growth has been widely concerned this study presented ecpg to reflect adverse environmental impact of economic growth and this indicator is defined as the total environmental cost divided by the gdp in a year and it describes the environmental loss intensity caused by economic development the bigger indicator value reflects the larger environmental harm degree caused by economic development or the lower net positive output rate structural coordination degree scd to promote sustainable development economic quality should be continuously improved which means decreasing energy consumption per unit of economic output reducing environmental cost per unit of energy use and descending environmental cost per unit of economic output and thus the above mentioned three indicators eupg ecpe ecpg are all negatively correlative to quality of economic development here the index scd was built to trace dynamic change of quality of economic development in a study period and it is calculated using formula 5 5 sc d j 1 e u p g j 1 e c p e j 1 e c p g j 1 e u p g 0 1 e c p e 0 1 e c p g 0 where eupgj ecpej and ecpgj represent the energy consumption per unit of gdp the environmental cost per unit of energy use and the environmental cost per unit of gdp in the j th year respectively eupgo ecpeo and ecpgo stand for the energy use per unit of gdp the environmental cost per unit of energy use and the environmental cost per unit of gdp in the reference year respectively based on the reference year 1989 the larger index value means the smaller intensity of energy utilization and or the lower intensity of environmental harm caused by economic growth so the quality of economic development is becoming better generally this index is influenced by industrial structure energy mix technical innovation related policies and laws regulations scale harmony degree shd to better evaluate sustainable development level several core factors should be concerned i e total economic output total energy consumption and total environmental cost since industrial revolution sustainable development has been seriously challenged due to overload of fossil energy sources and deficit of environmental capacity caused by extensive economic mode in the long term sustainable development could be achieved only through keeping proper economic growth while decreasing energy use and reducing environmental cost here the index shd was proposed to describe relative level of sustainable development based on one reference year in a region or country and it can be computed using the following formula 6 sh d j g d p j e u j e c j g d p 0 e u 0 e c 0 where gdpj euj and ecj represent gross domestic product energy use and environmental cost in the j th year respectively gdpo euo and eco means gross domestic product energy use and environmental cost in the reference year respectively relative to that in the reference year the larger index value means the more harmonious relationship between economy energy and the environment and this could raise the sustainability level of economic development this index is influenced by industrial structure energy mix technical progress environmental protection measures natural conditions especially resources capacity and environmental capacity etc here the adopted two indices have advantages over existing indicators considering 1 scd grasps the main aspects of quality of economic development in one macroeconomic system using three core indicators i e energy use per unit of gdp environmental cost per unit of energy use and environmental cost per unit of gdp and thus it is convenient to trace quality of economic development of one country or region based on a reference year and 2 shd describes relative sustainability of a country or region based on a reference year using three core parameters i e gross domestic product energy use and environmental cost so it is easy to adopt this index to trace relative trend of sustainability of economic development compared to those related existing indicators they can better reflect quality and sustainability of economic development in a country or region only using several core indicators or parameters therefore they are easier to act as one of barometers of macroeconomic development moreover there exists interaction between gross domestic product energy use and environmental cost and thus they have compound effect on quality and sustainability of macroeconomic development through their intensity indicators and aggregate indicators respectively so the two indices calculated by simple multiplication can well represent character of the compound system composed of economy energy and the environment 3 3 vector autoregressive model through the time series data on the air environmental cost and the data on energy consumption and gdp in china from 1989 to 2016 econometric models can be used to test whether there exist long term and short term interactions and causality between energy use and economic growth and air environmental cost in the country so as to reveal the underlying obstacles hindering sustainable development of social economy here the vector autoregressive var model in econometrics proposed by christopher sims in 1980 sims 1980 was applied to description of interactions and causality between the three factors considering 1 this model is suitable for exploring the long term dynamic relationships between variables because it is seldom subject to theoretical constraints xu and lin 2015 and 2 the var model analyzes the results not by regression coefficient estimation but by cointegration test granger causality test impulse response function and variance decomposition zhang 2019 therein the stability of the sequence must be firstly tested before subsequent analysis box et al 2015 at present the main method to judge the stability of time series is unit root test and it is used to determine whether there exists a unit root in the sequence this work often adopts the augmented dickey fuller adf unit root method to test the stability of variables the optimal lag period is determined by schwarz information criterion sic next cointegration test was implemented using the theory of cointegration put forward by engle and granger engle and granger 1987 to judge whether this linear combination exists or not between different varies gao 2006 this study used johansen test method johansen and juselius 1990 to conduct co integration analysis of the interactions between energy economy and air environmental cost if the linear combination exists it is considered that there exists a long term stable equilibrium relationship among these variables and then the form of this long term stable equilibrium relationship can be further obtained so granger causality test can be done to analyze the causality between variables zhang 2019 finally impulse response function describes how the change of an endogenous variable affects other ones in a var model mingran et al 2018 here the generalized impulse response function pesaran and shin 1998 was employed because it eliminates impacts of the order of variables 3 4 data resources and statistical tools here chinese gdp and per capita gdp are derived from china statistical yearbook 2018 national bureau of statistics of china 2019 and all the gdp related data are corrected to those based on the constant price in 1978 sm supplementary material a the categories of energy sources include coal petroleum natural gas hydro power nuclear power and wind power and the data on total energy consumption and related composition come from china statistical yearbooks 2001 2014 and 2018 national bureau of statistics of china 2019 here air emissions include so2 nox co2 and industrial dust and other air emissions are ignored due to unavailability of their basic data therein the data for so2 during 1989 1990 are from china statistical yearbook 1990 china nboso 1991 and china statistical yearbook 1991 china nboso 1992 the data during 1991 1995 and during 1998 2010 come from data compilation of annual report of environmental statistics 1991 2010 china emo 2016 the data in 1996 is estimated by interpolation based on the data from 1989 to 1997 due to the related data unavailability the data in 1997 come from china environmental status bulletin 1997 ministry of ecological environment of the people s republic of china 1998 and the data during 2011 2016 are cited from china statistical yearbook 2012 2018 national bureau of statistics of china 2019 for nox the data in 1990 1995 2000 2005 and 2010 are from ref shi et al 2014 the energy mix in 1989 was very similar to that in 1990 according to china statistical yearbook 2001 national bureau of statistics of china 2002 and the emission coefficient of nox was also considered same as that in 1990 according to ref shi et al 2014 therefore the amount of nox emission in 1989 can be thought to be positive correlation to the energy consumption in this year and nox emissions in 1989 can be estimated as follows the amount of nox emission in 1989 the amount of energy consumption in 1989 the amount of nox emission in 1990 the amount of energy consumption in 1989 8 78e06 t nox 9 69e11 kg standard coal 9 87e11 kg standard coal 8 62e06 t nox the data of nox during 2011 2016 are from national bureau of statistics of china 2019 as for co2 the data during 1989 2016 come from the eia website https www eia gov beta international data browser as for industrial dust the data during 1989 1990 are from china statistical yearbook 1990 china nboso 1991 and china statistical yearbook 1991 china nboso 1992 the data during 1991 2010 come from data compilation of annual report of environmental statistics 1991 2010 china emo 2016 due to data unavailability the data during 2011 2016 are obtained by estimating the proportion of industrial dust in smoke powder dust according to the data for smoke powder dust during the same period from china statistical yearbook 2012 2018 national bureau of statistics of china 2019 finally most of unit emergy values during this study period are obtained by consulting literature and related emergy database therein the rems in missing years are calculated according to formula 3 here the unit emergy values adopted are corrected to the latest baseline 12 0e 24 sej yr excel 2010 and eviews 10 0 are adopted to implement the related statistical tasks and modeling 4 case study in this section the proposed methods and indicators in section 3 are used to depict the interrelations between chinese economic growth energy consumption and air environmental cost during 1989 2016 and then the vector autoregressive var model in section 3 is adopted to investigate interactions of the three parameters and forecast the trends of these interactions in the future the detailed accounting results and analysis were given in sm b based on these accounting results trends of related indicator values and evaluation results from the var model were depicted as follows 4 1 trends of indicator values as for the indicator eupg it decreased by 62 24 from 1989 to 2016 fig 1 with an annual decline rate of 3 54 and an annual average value of 0 58 kg standard coal cny it reflects that chinese energy efficiency has climbed gradually during the study period the country has become the largest energy consumer and the biggest carbon dioxide emitter in the world ma et al 2019 the energy efficiency increased with china s economic growth during the research period but generally its energy efficiency is still at a relatively backward international level compared to some developed countries l zhu et al 2019 which mainly lies in unbalanced technical development in diverse regions and different sized industries besides unreasonable energy mix generally there is more advanced technical level in eastern china than central china and western china and larger sized enterprises have higher technical level than small and medium sized ones regarding the indicator ecpe fig 2 it was reduced by 49 36 from 1989 to 1991 it rose by 2 14 times from 1991 to 1998 it decreased by 58 58 during 1998 2002 it increased by 70 97 from 2002 to 2005 it descended by 46 25 during 2005 2016 during 1989 2016 the indicator value fell by 39 46 with an annual reduction rate of 1 84 and it had an annual average value of 7 91e 09 sej kg standard coal the energy conservation law of the people s republic of china came into effect in 1998 national energy administration 2017 which promoted china s energy utilization rate from 1998 to 2002 the rising indicator value during 2002 2005 is mainly attributed to the rapid expansion of high energy consumption and high pollution industries such as steel cement and electrolytic aluminum industries etc caused by the rapidly growing investment after chinese accession to the wto which was accompanied with lacking pollution prevention and treatment and environmental supervision in addition the number of private cars home appliances and other sales also climbed rapidly and all these had driven the rapid growth of domestic energy consumption in this period zhang 2013 all these accelerated energy consumption growth and then greatly promoted air emissions the declining indicator value during 2005 2016 is due to the establishment of an effective emission reduction mechanism by the chinese government including closing some enterprises with small production capacity high pollution and heavy energy consumption controlling coal production and consumption promoting use of clean energy sources increasingly strict supervision on energy saving and emissions reduction in each region etc all these measures vigorously optimize the economic structure and improve the industrial structure in the first four years of the 12th five year plan a total production capacity composed of 26 million kilowatts of small thermal power generation and 80 million tons of steel making and 300 million tons of cement was eliminated meanwhile 3184 paper making enterprises and 1467 printing and dyeing enterprises were closed down q wang et al 2015 especially after the air pollution prevention and control action plan was issued in 2013 j wang et al 2018 the chinese government reduces the air emissions from high pollution and high energy consumption industries by raising their environmental access threshold and speeding up elimination of their existing excess capacity for promoting clean energy utilization especially in those areas with serious air pollution the goal of negative growth of coal consumption was put forward to reduce the emissions of coal fired pollutants and the automobile exhaust was prevented and controlled by limiting the total number of motor vehicles in megacities improving fuel quality and strengthening the existing vehicle management wang et al 2016 the energy saving and emission reduction related policies and measures have improved chinese energy efficiency and reduced the emission intensity of energy use especially in the later period for the indicator ecpg fig 3 it decreased by 52 25 from 1989 to 1991 it increased by 89 44 during 1991 1998 it fell by 63 83 from 1998 to 2002 it rose by 87 50 during 2002 2005 it descended by 62 73 from 2005 to 2016 the indicator value decreased by 77 14 from 1989 to 2016 with an annual decline rate of 5 32 and it had an annual average value of 5 07e 09 sej cny during 2002 2005 china s economy grew rapidly after its accession to the wto fig 1 which rapidly promotes the intensity of air pollution due to extensive mode of economic growth caused by high energy consumption and high pollution industries to address the serious environmental issue the chinese government had to adjust economic structure and industrial structure j wang et al 2015 using some obligatory targets derived from energy saving and emission reduction during the eleventh five year plan period during the twelfth five year plan period chinese government focused on the implementation of 10 major projects such as emission reduction of major pollutants flue gas desulfurization of coal fired power plants etc which drove a significant increase in the amount of environmental protection investment in the country wang et al 2016 meanwhile the air pollution prevention and control action plan issued in 2013 also promoted china s investment of 2 trillion rmb in the field of air environmental protection which quickened the development of environmental protection equipment manufacturing construction and installation boiler technology transformation new energy vehicles and other related industries zhang et al 2015 all these measures moderately reduce the air pollution loss per unit of gdp in the later period as far as the index scd is concerned fig 4 it increased 3 39 times from 1989 to 1991 it decreased by 72 14 from 1991 to 1998 it rose by 6 65 times from 1998 to 2002 it fell by 71 56 from 2002 to 2005 it climbed by 3 15 times from 2005 to 2015 and it increased by 73 61 from 2015 to 2016 during the study period the index value was enhanced by 18 14 times with an annual increase rate of 11 55 and it had an annual average value of 5 45 the upward trend during 1989 2002 is mainly due to the rising proportion of tertiary industry in china jun 2006 in addition the implementation of the energy conservation law of the people s republic of china issued in 1998 improved the energy mix and energy efficiency at this stage national energy administration 2017 from 2002 to 2005 due to the deterioration of china s economic structure abnormal growth of china s heavy industries and inadequate environmental supervision x zhang et al 2014 after china s accession to the wto in 2002 the energy mix was worsen and energy efficiency was reduced which enhanced air environmental emission intensity at this stage li and lin b 2014 after 2005 the clearly rising index value is attributed to the continuous promotion of the energy saving and emission reduction and optimization of economic structure in the 11th and 12th five year plan moreover the index value rose significantly after 2015 indicating that the implementation of the 13th five year plan has further promoted structural coordination of china s economy due to the increasingly strict environmental supervision and the accelerated economic structure adjustment results from decomposition analysis sm c showed that eupg ecpe and ecpg have positive effects on scd during the study period of which ecpg is the largest contributor to this index in terms of the index shd fig 5 it climbed 95 62 from 1989 to 1991 it descended by 58 56 from 1991 to 1998 it rose by 1 29 times from 1998 to 2002 it fell by 63 97 from 2002 to 2005 and finally it increased by 45 22 from 2005 to 2016 along a slight fluctuation way during total study period generally the index value decreased by 2 70 with an annual decline rate of 0 10 this index value shows frequent fluctuation during the study period due to instability and low harmony degree of some policies and laws regulations weak supervision of the related measures hysteresis effect of some new policies and laws regulations complicated international situation etc generally the relationships between chinese economy energy use and its air environmental cost basically keep no changes from 1989 to 2016 and the trends of the index value differ from that of other ones to some degree in the same period e g the improvement rate of the index shd is obviously lower than that of scd in the study period at the same time the improvement speed of shd is much smaller than the growth rate of china s economy although part of the performance indicators have been improved the whole optimization of chinese economy is not obvious during the study period results from decomposition analysis sm c demonstrated that energy use has the most negative effect on shd during the study period and economic growth is the largest contributor to the index this shows that the energy use should be highly emphasized in the future it is worth mentioning that the implementation of the air pollution prevention and control action plan and related measures not only ensures the economic growth but also obviously reduces the air environmental cost and improves the structural coordination degree of chinese economy however these measures have not obviously improved the relationship between chinese economy energy and the air environment cost due to the limited time length of its implementation and its effect is worth further exploring in the future 4 2 empirical results of var 4 2 1 results of the unit root tests firstly to determine whether the sequences on chinese economy energy consumption and the air environmental cost satisfies the hypothesis that the variables in the cointegration test are monolithic and non stationary series of the same order eviews 10 0 software is used to carry out related adf unit root test for the three kinds of sequences respectively to eliminate the influence of dimension and heteroscedasticity natural logarithm value for each variable is used and here natural logarithm values of the gdp the energy consumption and the air environmental cost are recorded as lngdp lnene and lnec respectively the optimal lag period can be determined by sic table 4 reflects that lngdp lnene and lnec are non stationary time series at 5 significant level however the results from prob indicate that the first order differences of lngdp lnene and lnec are stationary at the 5 significant level since lngdp lnene and lnec have the same order sequence the var model can select the three sequences as research objects 4 2 2 the optimal lag order analysis after passing the adf unit root test the optimal lag order can be determined and it identifies five optimum lag orders table 5 therein the lag order with the most marked is the final optimal one for var model i e 2 4 2 3 johansen co integration tests next cointegration test is implemented to determine whether there is a cointegration relationship among the three parameters and then one can further eliminate the possibility of pseudo regression and then analyze whether there is a long term dynamic relationship between the three parameters since the optimal lag order of the johansen cointegration test is essentially the lag period of the first order difference variable of the var model so the optimal lag order of the cointegration model is 1 cointegration test results tables 6 and 7 based on both the trace test and the max eigenvalue test of the cointegration test respectively indicate that there is a cointegration equation at the 5 significance level this also means that there is a long term equilibrium relationship between lngdp lnene and lnec furthermore the related cointegration equation can be described using formula 8 it is found that there are positive correlations between china s economy energy consumption and its air environmental cost 7 lngdp 1 009490 l n e n e 0 311780 l n e c 15 59560 4 2 4 granger causality tests although there is a long term equilibrium relationship between lngdp lnene and lnec whether this relationship constitutes causal relationships between the three parameters requires further confirmation using the granger causality test according to prob values of the test results table 8 it is found that the null hypothesis that lnene does not granger cause lngdp and lnene does not granger cause lnec are rejected at the 10 significance level and the null hypothesis that lngdp does not granger cause lnec is also rejected at the 5 significance level therefore china s energy consumption significantly affects china s economic growth and air environmental cost and china s economic growth very significantly influences its air environmental cost 4 2 5 establishment of var model through unit root stability test cointegration test and granger causality test it can be concluded that the three variables meet the conditions of establishing var model the var model can be obtained using eviews 10 0 software to depict the interrelationships between chinese economy energy consumption and air environmental cost as follows 8 l n g d p l n e n e l n e c 1 421055 0 043031 1 795268 0 162034 1 267489 0 639480 0 013121 0 010914 0 730465 l n g d p l n e n e l n e c t 1 0 463886 0 102930 1 236676 0 117255 0 432713 0 904802 0 014836 0 045531 0 322896 l n g d p l n e n e l n e c t 2 0 072325 3 380976 21 49017 furthermore according to ar root stability test fig 6 it is found that all unit roots of the var model are in the unit circle 4 2 6 impulse response functions finally the impulse response functions can be adopted to describe the shock response ranges between chinese economy energy consumption and air environmental cost based on the established var model moreover it also reflects the dynamic impact of shocks on current and future values of dependent variables here when a positive unit size impact is given to lnene and lngdp respectively the impulse response function was shown in fig 7 as depicted in fig 7 a when a unit of positive pulse is given to the energy consumption the economy will grow substantially and reach its peak 0 03 from 2017 to 2022 and then gradually become stabilize this shows that on the basis of existing energy consumption chinese economy can keep rapid growth until 2022 with increasing energy consumption however the potential promotion of energy consumption will wear out after 2022 therefore the chinese government should also explore other driving forces for its economic growth in the future when a unit of positive pulse is imposed on the economy fig 7 b the air environmental cost will rise rapidly and reach the peak 0 05 from 2017 to 2019 and then it will gradually tend to become stable this shows that according to the current trend china s economic growth will simultaneously increase the air environmental cost in the next three years and then the positive effect on the air environmental cost will decline and tend to be stable in the later period as given in fig 7 c when a unit of positive pulse is placed on the energy consumption the air environmental cost will also ascend rapidly and reach a peak 0 043316 from 2017 to 2019 and then it will decrease rapidly and tend to stabilize this shows that chinese increasing energy consumption will obviously raise the air environmental cost in the short period and afterwards this kind of promotion effect will be greatly reduced and keep stable in summary it can be inferred that china s economy energy consumption and air environmental pollution are still positively correlated in the near future which shows that china s economic growth is still based on increase of fossil energy use and air environmental pollution from the results of impulse response china s economic growth are closely coupled with energy consumption and rising energy consumption will promote rapid economic growth in a short period meanwhile china s fast economic growth and energy use will bring a significant increase in air environmental cost which goes against the concept of sustainable development therefore improvement of part performance indicators does not obviously promote the whole optimization and the underlying reasons could root in conflicts between goals of different plans and diverse policy measures 5 discussion as shown in table 9 there are many similar trends of most of indicator values between this study and related works when considering the same study period however this study promoted related research field through 1 integrating environmental capacity and environmental emissions harm to biological ingredients into emergy accounting of emissions impacts 2 refining the existing indicator system describing relationships between economy energy and the environment using limited parameters 3 updating statistic data to reflect new situation of chinese social economy it is noted that other air emissions besides co2 nox dust and so2 have not been considered in this study due to data unavailability which could underestimate air environmental cost to some degree in addition the limited time scope of this study could incur some uncertainty which need to be further explored in the future however relative to other related studies this study can provide more reliable and timely policy making information due to consideration of corresponding environmental capacities and pollutants harm to ecological ingredients and updated basic data and thus it can better disclose general trends of relationships between chinese economy energy consumption and air environmental cost in this study period and trends of their interactions in next years in summary this study reveals that main obstacles hindering sustainability of chinese economy come from unreasonable energy mix and low energy efficiency followed by air pollution 6 conclusion and policy implications 6 1 conclusion chinese economic mix is obviously improved during this study period mainly due to reduction of air environmental cost per unit of economic output however no obvious improvement is seen in the relationship between chinese economy energy and air environmental cost in the total research period because contribution of economic growth is offset by negative impact of energy consumption increase energy consumption can significantly promote china s economic growth until 2022 and air environmental cost until 2019 and china s economic growth can very significantly drive its air environmental cost before 2019 afterwards promotion of energy and economy will become weak and then trend to be stable therefore chinese government should highly emphasized energy related issues and coordination between economy energy and the air environment in the future 6 2 policy implications regarding improvement of energy efficiency in the short term raising coal utilization efficiency should be emphasized through technical progress considering the leading role of this energy source in the foreseeable future especially in those industrial sectors highly relying on coal consumption such as thermal power industry cement industry steel and iron industry etc meanwhile coal chemical industry can be further accelerated to raise clean utilization level of coal and somewhat mitigate external dependence of crude oil in the long run development of clean and renewable energy sources should be vigorously promoted to solve related issues derived from fossil energy use although share of clean and renewable energy sources grew by an annual increase rate of 3 77 in this research period the hidden fossil energy use and potential environmental emissions in development of these energy sources have not been fully embodied in related policies and laws so related quality standards on clean and renewable energy sources based on its life cycle environmental assessment and life cycle cost should be formulated to ensure real cleanness and renewability and affordable cost of these energy sources to popularize use of these energy sources environmental benefit from them should be also fully quantified in terms of money and then act as one of important references of fiscal subsidy likewise environmental cost from fossil energy use should be quantified in units of money to guide environmental taxation only by this way can clean and renewable energy sources compete with fossil energy sources on equal terms related quantification methods based on a full life cycle prospect should consider natural contribution to economic activities and environmental emissions impacts on social economy while many related studies have been done to address these issues there are some flaws including inconsistency of factors and analysis boundary being considered lacking systematicness and logicality of methods being adopted unreliability of basic data and transformation factors etc and all these issues should be addressed through deep exploration in the future finally energy saving derived from management optimization should be continuously strengthened in all sectors through comprehensive strategy composed of administrative economic and educational measures specially advanced information technologies should be widely applied to management optimization in the process of energy production and energy utilization due to their real time capability and flexibility to control air pollution on one hand environmental capacity of nox and emission amount of co2 based on chinese obligation of emission reduction should be further improved and then assigned to each region as guidance of all kinds of planning on the other hand pollution prevention should be firstly emphasized through proper choice of raw materials and production process optimization and emissions reduction effectiveness of prevention and treatment measures should be carefully investigated from life cycle angle to find out those with net emissions reduction effectiveness as for economic growth chinese government has strived to adjust the primary industry and secondary industry through technical progress and management optimization and boom the tertiary industry especially those new industries based on information technologies such as artificial intelligence big data application etc however economic development planning of each industry should be based on energy supply and environmental capacity in different development phases of diverse regions to ensure good quality of economy in this respect china has gained some good experiences in recent years such as compelling transformation of economic modes through environmental quality promoting differentiated development modes in different regions through classified planning for territorial space implementing binding targets of energy saving and emissions reduction based on resources capacity and environmental capacity etc due to complexity of factors being considered and complicated space time characteristics in the country there is a long way to go for chinese government to properly deal with potential conflicts between economic growth energy saving and emissions reduction in the process of formulation of all categories of plans policies laws regulations and related practical application and all these issues will need continuous exploration in the future credit authorship

24531,the fast growing chinese economy consumes large amounts of energy and thus incurs high air emissions the interactions between chinese economy energy and its air environmental cost are worth further exploring for promoting the sustainability of the country to this end several indicators based on currency energy and emergy are constructed to depict the interrelations between the three factors during 1989 2016 and then a vector autoregressive var model is adopted to forecast the trends of these interactions in the future it is found that 1 chinese energy efficiency increases by 62 24 2 air environmental cost per unit energy use decreases by 39 46 3 air environmental cost per unit economic output decreases by 77 14 4 structure coordination degree increases by 18 14 times 5 scale harmony degree decreases by 2 70 6 china s energy consumption significantly enhances its economic growth and air environmental cost and china s economic growth also very clearly promote its air environmental cost 7 chinese energy consumption will obviously promote its economic growth before 2022 and china s economic growth and energy use will clearly raise the air environmental cost before 2019 chinese government should further promote coordination between economy energy and air environmental protection in the future graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chinese economy energy consumption air environmental cost indicator var model 1 introduction economic development based on fossil energy depletion and environmental pollution has been widely criticized wu and ning 2018 human beings have being exploiting fossil energy sources to meet their growing energy demands for the economic growth lots of fossil fuels combustion leads to the greenhouse effect acid rain and other local environmental pollution nicoletti et al 2015 china known as the largest world s factory tang et al 2015 is also the world s largest country in terms of its energy consumption and co2 carbon dioxide emissions chinese fossil energy demand has reached unprecedented levels since 2015 zhang et al 2017 and thus caused serious environmental problems which is challenging its sustainable development shuai et al 2017 china s economy rose by an annual growth rate of 6 66 during 2015 2019 while its energy consumption still climbed by an annual increase rate of 2 92 in the same period national bureau of statistics of china 2020 although so2 nox and particle pollutant decreased by an annual decline rate of 29 58 9 64 and 8 28 respectively during this period ministry of ecological environment of the people s republic of china 2020 it is still a huge challenge for chinese government to control total emissions of co2 and air pollutants while keeping economic growth therein one of the most intractable issues lies in simultaneously mitigating emissions of air pollutants pm2 5 o3 and ghgs greenhouse gasses lu et al 2020 at present only 10 of cities in the country have truly realized coordination between their environment protection and economic development j wang et al 2015 therefore it is still urgent to deeply explore the relationships between economy energy and the environment in the country yuan et al 2015 and then find out related countermeasures to promote decoupling of economic growth and energy consumption and environmental emissions impact for its sustainable development in the long run 2 literature review in recent years many scholars have explored interactions between economy energy and the environment in different countries he and lin 2018 investigated time varying effects of cyclical fluctuations in china s energy industry on the macro economy and carbon emissions through combining principal component analysis and a time varying parameter structural var model and they found that cyclical changes in the energy industry lagged fluctuations in the macroeconomic environment and the effect of energy shocks on carbon emissions has gradually weakened over time but ignorance of local environmental emissions in their study could lead to incomplete policy making information for coordinating relationships between energy economy and the environment x zhang et al 2014 explored the interaction between chinese economy energy consumption and air emissions impacts using their proposed indicator system based on energy currency and emergy and put forward the related policy implications but they did not considered air environmental capacity and thus reduced accuracy of air emissions impact results abbasi and riaz 2016 explored the influence of economic and financial development on carbon emissions in pakistan during 1970 2011 using an augmented var approach they found that the financial variables played a role in emission mitigation only in the latter period and the increasing emissions impact from rising per capita incomes greatly exceeded the relative magnitude of emissions mitigation derived from financial variables however ignorance of energy consumption and local environmental emissions could lead to incomplete information for coordinating relationship between economic development and environmental protection chen and xu 2017 investigated relationship between air quality and economic development in the provincial capital cities of china using regression analysis based on ekcs and provided a meaningful reference for policy makers however absence of energy consumption could not discover the underlying driving force lin and wang 2019 explored inconsistency of economic growth and electricity consumption in china during 2000 2016 using a panel var approach and their results explain the reasons for inconsistency and identify the key factors but other energy sources except electricity and environmental emissions have not been considered yet and thus more adequate information for promoting social economic sustainability is lacking fan and hao 2020 investigated the relationship amongst renewable energy consumption economic growth and foreign direct investment in china and their results showed that there is a long term and stable equilibrium relationship between gross domestic products per capita foreign direct investment per capita and renewable energy consumption per capita but neglect of environmental emissions could not provide comprehensive information for policy making nowadays it has been found that more scholars have shown interest in investigation of relationship and interaction between co2 emissions and social economic development using econometric approach and related methods therein umar et al 2020 examined the long run and causal effects of innovation financial development and transportation infrastructure on co2 emissions in china from 1971 to 2018 using the combined cointegration and wavelet coherence approaches adebayo and akinsola 2021 explored the causal linkage between co2 emissions economic growth and energy consumption in thailand utilizing the wavelet coherence approach conventional granger and the toda yamamoto causality techniques he et al 2021 explored the impact of financial development and globalization on consumption based carbon emissions in mexico while controlling growth trade openness and energy consumption using the dual adjustment approach adebayo et al 2021 studied the relationship between urbanization co2 emissions gross capital formation energy use and economic growth in south korea between 1965 and 2019 using recent econometric techniques orhan et al 2021 assessed the linkage between co2 emissions and economic growth while considering the role of energy consumption agriculture and trade openness in india between 1965 and 2019 using the bayer and hanck cointegration and gradual shift causality tests and the wavelet coherence test soylu et al 2021 applied the wavelet tools and the gradual shift causality test to the interactions between co2 emissions and renewable energy economic growth trade openness and energy usage in china between 1965 and 2019 zhang et al 2021 explored the long run and causal impact of economic growth financial development urbanization and gross capital formation on malaysia s co2 emissions using maki cointegration and wavelet coherence tests and so on these studies provided related beneficial suggestions for policy makers to coordinate relationship between economic development and co2 emissions however other air emissions except co2 have not been considered which could not provide full policy making information for sustainable development of social economy generally when evaluating causal relationships between economy energy and environmental emissions the gap of existing research includes relatively single environmental emissions considered generally co2 and ignoring differences of diverse emissions impacts on human and the environment derived from accounting approach based on material flow analysis so information of environmental emissions and their impacts is incomplete and superficial to evaluating emissions impacts on human health and the environment more objectively some scholars have carried out related studies therein x zhang et al 2014 quantified emissions impacts through accounting ecological service needed to dilute pollutants to their legal limits and environmental cost derived from pollutants harm to human health in terms of emergy however they have not considered related environmental capacity yet which led to overestimation of emissions impacts all abovementioned defects could lead to somewhat distorted results for decision making li et al 2021 quantified environmental benefits of old community renewal in nanjing of china using emergy analysis and then provided some beneficial suggestions and these studies highlight advantages of emergy analysis over other related methods due to consideration of environmental contribution and quantity differences of diverse environmental factors when quantifying environmental cost caused by emissions the ema can measure impacts of different types of emissions in terms of a common unit liu et al 2011 odum 1996 however as an effective means of communicating natural systems and economic systems this environmental accounting method has not been combined with some popular economic methods in practical application which makes many issues hard to be fully explained for example ema can be applied to analysis of the overall operation status and evolution trend of the eco economic system but it seems powerless in the face of such problems as what kind of interaction mechanism and causality exist between the natural system and social economy therefore in order to providing more complete and clear information for decision making for one complex system composed of economy and energy and the environment it is necessary to set up one set of indicator system composed of economy energy the environment related factors so as to fully describe their interactions meanwhile other factors should be also considered when calculating the environmental cost for enhancing the reasonability of accounting results such as environmental capacity biodiversity hazards and so on furthermore in order to reveal the related underlying reasons one should explore the causal relationship between the three factors through combining econometrics methods and other measurement tools and methods x h zhang et al 2014 over the past twenty years chinese government gradually implemented energy saving and emission reduction policies and achieved some improvements tilt 2019 especially since 2000 chinese government has implemented a serial of circular economy related policies to promote resource saving and environmental protection in its economic development j zhu et al 2019 however it is not clear how these policies and measures affect the interrelations between chinese economy and energy and air emissions impacts therefore it is necessary to quantify the impacts of air emissions on the ecological system and human health and then reveal the interactions and mutual causality between chinese economy energy and air emissions impacts and predict the future trends so as to provide useful information for policy makers to promote high quality development of chinese economy characterized as low energy use and low air environmental cost this paper investigates the relationships between chinese economic growth and energy use and its air environmental cost during 1989 2016 and then explores the causal relationships between the three factors so as to find out related obstacles hindering chinese economy decoupling with energy use and air environmental cost for policy making therein the atmospheric environmental cost is firstly quantified in terms of emergy then several indicators based on currency and energy and emergy is founded to depict the relationships between economy energy and environment cost and finally a var model is adopted to reveal the mutual causality between economy energy air environmental cost and further forecast the future trends of interactions of the three factors in the next fifteen years the approach was adopted in this study due to 1 emergy method considering the environmental contribution to economy and its common measurement based on objective standard 2 improved quantification of emissions impacts through considering environmental capacity and 3 var quantifying causal relationship between economy energy and emissions impacts the novelty of this work lies in 1 its consideration of environmental capacity when quantifying emissions impacts in terms of emergy and 2 setting up several indicators based on currency and energy and emergy to characterize the compound system composed of economy and energy and the environment and 3 exploring the interactions and mutual causality between chinese economy and energy and the air environmental cost with updating data using the var model by doing so this work can fill in the existing knowledge gap in the literature through 1 improving the existing emergy amounting approach of emissions impacts by considering related environmental capacities and pollutants harm to biological ingredients 2 exploring the underlying obstacles affecting the harmony between china s economy energy and the atmospheric environment from a novel viewpoint which can complement the existing studies and then provide more sufficient decision information for policy makers and 3 the presented indicators and methods can also act as one of policy making tools for other countries in the world for coordinating the relationships between their economy energy and atmospheric environmental protection next section 3 introduces the adopted methods and indicator system the data sources and the statistic tools the research results are provided in section 4 and discussions and policy implications are implemented in section 5 finally section 6 summarizes the main conclusions 3 methods 3 1 quantifying air environmental cost here air environmental cost is quantified in units of emergy emergy is defined as the quantity of one kind of energy contained in one flow or stored energy odum 1996 in practical applications solar energy solar emjoules abbreviated as sej is often used as a measure unit lan et al 2002 emergy baseline as the reference when implementing an emergy evaluation is the sum of the annual emergy input of solar radiation tidal energy and geothermal energy on the earth brown and ulgiati 2016 there are five emergy benchmarks in existing emergy related research i e 9 44e 24 sej yr odum 1996 9 26e 24 sej yr campbell 1998 15 83e 24 sej yr odum et al 2000 15 20e 24 sej yr brown and ulgiati 2010 and 12 00e 24 sej yr brown et al 2016 this study adopts the latest emergy benchmark 12 00e 24 sej yr due to its improved accuracy here the air environmental cost includes the human health loss and the ecosystem loss 3 1 1 human health loss caused by air emissions air emissions could influence human health through many ways when exceeding their related environmental capacity which is mainly derived from their migration and transformation in atmospheric environment daly disability adjusted life year put forward by world health organization has been widely adopted to measure the impact of air emissions on human health hofstetter 1998 goedkoop and spriensma 2001 the decrease of daly means the loss or reduction of the health life years of human beings or the years of their disability due to the emissions influence human health loss caused by environmental emissions can be quantified in units of emergy because human health is supported through consumption of all resources and energy sources which can be measured by emergy use based on the comprehensive consideration of the atmospheric environmental capacity of china in the past 30 years xu et al 2018 this study calculates the human health loss caused by so2 nox and dust using formula 1 here atmospheric environmental capacity is defined as follows for a given volume in atmosphere and time interval when pollutant generation source and removal sink reach a balance the pollutant concentration maintains a specified value threshold concentration and the rate of pollutant generation emission is defined as the atmospheric environmental capacity under the threshold concentration therefore atmospheric environmental capacity expresses the balance between pollutant emissions and their removal at specified pollutant concentrations compared with those studies ignoring environmental capacity here consideration of environmental capacity could reasonably assess air emissions adverse influence on human health and ecological systems because air emissions have no adverse effect on human health and ecological systems when being within related environmental capacities 1 f 1 a i r i 1 n m i m e i d a l y i π h j where f1 air is the total human health loss derived from air emissions sej yr mi stands for the mass of the i th air pollutant kg yr here i 1 2 3 mei is environmental capacity of the i th air pollutant representing the 30 year recurrence period in china kg yr table 1 dalyi is the related daly value of the i th air pollutant yr kg table 2 τh j is per capita emergy consumption in the j th year sej person yr and it is calculated using the formula 2 2 π h j g d p j r e m j p o p j where gdpj is the real gdp in the j th year based on 1978 cny yr popj is the total population in the j th year remj stands for ratio of emergy to money sej cny in the j th year and it is calculated according to the formula 3 based on the linear correlation of rems of different years in one country according to ref campbell et al 2014 3 r e m j r e m x i g d p j i g d p x g d p j g d p x where remx represents ratios of emergy to money in the year 2000 2004 and 2008 from the national environmental account database http www cep ees ufl edu nead therein rem2000 1 81e 12 sej cny rem2004 1 62e 12 sej cny rem2008 1 25e 12 sej cny corrected to the baseline 12 00e 24 sej yr igdpj is the gdp gross domestic product index in the j th year from 1989 to 2016 based on 1978 igdpx stands for gdp index for the year 2000 2004 and 2008 respectively gdpj represents the gdp in the j th year from 1989 to 2016 gdpx means the gdp in the year 2000 2004 and 2008 respectively cny yr in the calculation process the rems from 1989 to 1999 are calculated through the extension method the lacking rem values during 2000 2008 are attained through the interpolation method and the rem values from 2009 to 2016 are estimated using the extension method based on the data during 2000 2008 3 1 2 ecosystem loss caused by air emissions the air emissions could also destroy the biological ingredients in the natural ecosystem when their environmental capacity is lacking jun 2006 then ecological balance could be destroyed and then cause potential loss to human society therefore it is necessary to account for air emissions harm to the ecosystem the reasonability i e why ecosystem loss caused by air emissions can be quantified in terms of emergy could be explained as follows ecosystem is supported by various ecological elements besides energy however various ecological elements supporting ecosystem are finally supported by one kind of energy i e solar energy measured in sej in fact here emergy is different from general term energy because it reflects one memory of energy during the course of form of a kind of output therefore here emergy analysis differs from traditional energy analysis because it includes many complicated natural and artificial transformation processes which has been described and explained in detail by odum ht and other related scholars the specific impact can be measured by the following formula 4 f 2 a i r u e v s l i 1 n m i m e i s l i where f2 air is emergy loss derived from harm of air emissions to the ecosystem sej yr uevsl represents the unit emergy of a species sej species yr and it is equal to the global emergy baseline 12 00e 24 sej yr brown and ulgiati 2016 divided by the total number of species of 1 00e12 on earth locey and lennon 2016 i e 1 20e13 sej species yr mi represents the mass of the i th pollutant discharged kg yr sli represents the potential loss of species caused by per unit mass of the i th air pollutant species yr kg shown in table 3 3 2 the indicator system being adopted relationships between economy energy and the environment could be described by intensity indicators structural index and scale index here intensity indicators mainly include energy use per unit of gdp environmental cost per unit of energy use and environmental cost per unit of energy use structural index refers to structural coordination degree and scale index means scale harmony degree and they can be founded based on currency energy and emergy and explained as follows energy use per unit of gdp eupg kg standard coal cny it is defined as the total energy use divided by the gdp in a year x zhang et al 2014 which has been widely applied to measurement of the energy efficiency of the economic development in different regions and countries the larger indicator value means the lower energy efficiency of the economic development environmental cost per unit of energy use ecpe sej kg standard coal after industrial revolution energy sources especially fossil energy sources are both driving force of economic growth and derivation of environmental impacts here ecpe was proposed to describe environmental cost caused by energy use and it is defined as the total environmental cost divided by the total energy use in a year x zhang et al 2014 this indicator reflects the impact of energy consumption on the environment meanwhile it also indirectly reflects the efficiency of energy use the bigger indicator value means the greater environmental pollution intensity from energy consumption or indirectly reflects the lower energy efficiency environmental cost per unit of gdp ecpg sej cny since industrial revolution environmental impact of economic growth has been widely concerned this study presented ecpg to reflect adverse environmental impact of economic growth and this indicator is defined as the total environmental cost divided by the gdp in a year and it describes the environmental loss intensity caused by economic development the bigger indicator value reflects the larger environmental harm degree caused by economic development or the lower net positive output rate structural coordination degree scd to promote sustainable development economic quality should be continuously improved which means decreasing energy consumption per unit of economic output reducing environmental cost per unit of energy use and descending environmental cost per unit of economic output and thus the above mentioned three indicators eupg ecpe ecpg are all negatively correlative to quality of economic development here the index scd was built to trace dynamic change of quality of economic development in a study period and it is calculated using formula 5 5 sc d j 1 e u p g j 1 e c p e j 1 e c p g j 1 e u p g 0 1 e c p e 0 1 e c p g 0 where eupgj ecpej and ecpgj represent the energy consumption per unit of gdp the environmental cost per unit of energy use and the environmental cost per unit of gdp in the j th year respectively eupgo ecpeo and ecpgo stand for the energy use per unit of gdp the environmental cost per unit of energy use and the environmental cost per unit of gdp in the reference year respectively based on the reference year 1989 the larger index value means the smaller intensity of energy utilization and or the lower intensity of environmental harm caused by economic growth so the quality of economic development is becoming better generally this index is influenced by industrial structure energy mix technical innovation related policies and laws regulations scale harmony degree shd to better evaluate sustainable development level several core factors should be concerned i e total economic output total energy consumption and total environmental cost since industrial revolution sustainable development has been seriously challenged due to overload of fossil energy sources and deficit of environmental capacity caused by extensive economic mode in the long term sustainable development could be achieved only through keeping proper economic growth while decreasing energy use and reducing environmental cost here the index shd was proposed to describe relative level of sustainable development based on one reference year in a region or country and it can be computed using the following formula 6 sh d j g d p j e u j e c j g d p 0 e u 0 e c 0 where gdpj euj and ecj represent gross domestic product energy use and environmental cost in the j th year respectively gdpo euo and eco means gross domestic product energy use and environmental cost in the reference year respectively relative to that in the reference year the larger index value means the more harmonious relationship between economy energy and the environment and this could raise the sustainability level of economic development this index is influenced by industrial structure energy mix technical progress environmental protection measures natural conditions especially resources capacity and environmental capacity etc here the adopted two indices have advantages over existing indicators considering 1 scd grasps the main aspects of quality of economic development in one macroeconomic system using three core indicators i e energy use per unit of gdp environmental cost per unit of energy use and environmental cost per unit of gdp and thus it is convenient to trace quality of economic development of one country or region based on a reference year and 2 shd describes relative sustainability of a country or region based on a reference year using three core parameters i e gross domestic product energy use and environmental cost so it is easy to adopt this index to trace relative trend of sustainability of economic development compared to those related existing indicators they can better reflect quality and sustainability of economic development in a country or region only using several core indicators or parameters therefore they are easier to act as one of barometers of macroeconomic development moreover there exists interaction between gross domestic product energy use and environmental cost and thus they have compound effect on quality and sustainability of macroeconomic development through their intensity indicators and aggregate indicators respectively so the two indices calculated by simple multiplication can well represent character of the compound system composed of economy energy and the environment 3 3 vector autoregressive model through the time series data on the air environmental cost and the data on energy consumption and gdp in china from 1989 to 2016 econometric models can be used to test whether there exist long term and short term interactions and causality between energy use and economic growth and air environmental cost in the country so as to reveal the underlying obstacles hindering sustainable development of social economy here the vector autoregressive var model in econometrics proposed by christopher sims in 1980 sims 1980 was applied to description of interactions and causality between the three factors considering 1 this model is suitable for exploring the long term dynamic relationships between variables because it is seldom subject to theoretical constraints xu and lin 2015 and 2 the var model analyzes the results not by regression coefficient estimation but by cointegration test granger causality test impulse response function and variance decomposition zhang 2019 therein the stability of the sequence must be firstly tested before subsequent analysis box et al 2015 at present the main method to judge the stability of time series is unit root test and it is used to determine whether there exists a unit root in the sequence this work often adopts the augmented dickey fuller adf unit root method to test the stability of variables the optimal lag period is determined by schwarz information criterion sic next cointegration test was implemented using the theory of cointegration put forward by engle and granger engle and granger 1987 to judge whether this linear combination exists or not between different varies gao 2006 this study used johansen test method johansen and juselius 1990 to conduct co integration analysis of the interactions between energy economy and air environmental cost if the linear combination exists it is considered that there exists a long term stable equilibrium relationship among these variables and then the form of this long term stable equilibrium relationship can be further obtained so granger causality test can be done to analyze the causality between variables zhang 2019 finally impulse response function describes how the change of an endogenous variable affects other ones in a var model mingran et al 2018 here the generalized impulse response function pesaran and shin 1998 was employed because it eliminates impacts of the order of variables 3 4 data resources and statistical tools here chinese gdp and per capita gdp are derived from china statistical yearbook 2018 national bureau of statistics of china 2019 and all the gdp related data are corrected to those based on the constant price in 1978 sm supplementary material a the categories of energy sources include coal petroleum natural gas hydro power nuclear power and wind power and the data on total energy consumption and related composition come from china statistical yearbooks 2001 2014 and 2018 national bureau of statistics of china 2019 here air emissions include so2 nox co2 and industrial dust and other air emissions are ignored due to unavailability of their basic data therein the data for so2 during 1989 1990 are from china statistical yearbook 1990 china nboso 1991 and china statistical yearbook 1991 china nboso 1992 the data during 1991 1995 and during 1998 2010 come from data compilation of annual report of environmental statistics 1991 2010 china emo 2016 the data in 1996 is estimated by interpolation based on the data from 1989 to 1997 due to the related data unavailability the data in 1997 come from china environmental status bulletin 1997 ministry of ecological environment of the people s republic of china 1998 and the data during 2011 2016 are cited from china statistical yearbook 2012 2018 national bureau of statistics of china 2019 for nox the data in 1990 1995 2000 2005 and 2010 are from ref shi et al 2014 the energy mix in 1989 was very similar to that in 1990 according to china statistical yearbook 2001 national bureau of statistics of china 2002 and the emission coefficient of nox was also considered same as that in 1990 according to ref shi et al 2014 therefore the amount of nox emission in 1989 can be thought to be positive correlation to the energy consumption in this year and nox emissions in 1989 can be estimated as follows the amount of nox emission in 1989 the amount of energy consumption in 1989 the amount of nox emission in 1990 the amount of energy consumption in 1989 8 78e06 t nox 9 69e11 kg standard coal 9 87e11 kg standard coal 8 62e06 t nox the data of nox during 2011 2016 are from national bureau of statistics of china 2019 as for co2 the data during 1989 2016 come from the eia website https www eia gov beta international data browser as for industrial dust the data during 1989 1990 are from china statistical yearbook 1990 china nboso 1991 and china statistical yearbook 1991 china nboso 1992 the data during 1991 2010 come from data compilation of annual report of environmental statistics 1991 2010 china emo 2016 due to data unavailability the data during 2011 2016 are obtained by estimating the proportion of industrial dust in smoke powder dust according to the data for smoke powder dust during the same period from china statistical yearbook 2012 2018 national bureau of statistics of china 2019 finally most of unit emergy values during this study period are obtained by consulting literature and related emergy database therein the rems in missing years are calculated according to formula 3 here the unit emergy values adopted are corrected to the latest baseline 12 0e 24 sej yr excel 2010 and eviews 10 0 are adopted to implement the related statistical tasks and modeling 4 case study in this section the proposed methods and indicators in section 3 are used to depict the interrelations between chinese economic growth energy consumption and air environmental cost during 1989 2016 and then the vector autoregressive var model in section 3 is adopted to investigate interactions of the three parameters and forecast the trends of these interactions in the future the detailed accounting results and analysis were given in sm b based on these accounting results trends of related indicator values and evaluation results from the var model were depicted as follows 4 1 trends of indicator values as for the indicator eupg it decreased by 62 24 from 1989 to 2016 fig 1 with an annual decline rate of 3 54 and an annual average value of 0 58 kg standard coal cny it reflects that chinese energy efficiency has climbed gradually during the study period the country has become the largest energy consumer and the biggest carbon dioxide emitter in the world ma et al 2019 the energy efficiency increased with china s economic growth during the research period but generally its energy efficiency is still at a relatively backward international level compared to some developed countries l zhu et al 2019 which mainly lies in unbalanced technical development in diverse regions and different sized industries besides unreasonable energy mix generally there is more advanced technical level in eastern china than central china and western china and larger sized enterprises have higher technical level than small and medium sized ones regarding the indicator ecpe fig 2 it was reduced by 49 36 from 1989 to 1991 it rose by 2 14 times from 1991 to 1998 it decreased by 58 58 during 1998 2002 it increased by 70 97 from 2002 to 2005 it descended by 46 25 during 2005 2016 during 1989 2016 the indicator value fell by 39 46 with an annual reduction rate of 1 84 and it had an annual average value of 7 91e 09 sej kg standard coal the energy conservation law of the people s republic of china came into effect in 1998 national energy administration 2017 which promoted china s energy utilization rate from 1998 to 2002 the rising indicator value during 2002 2005 is mainly attributed to the rapid expansion of high energy consumption and high pollution industries such as steel cement and electrolytic aluminum industries etc caused by the rapidly growing investment after chinese accession to the wto which was accompanied with lacking pollution prevention and treatment and environmental supervision in addition the number of private cars home appliances and other sales also climbed rapidly and all these had driven the rapid growth of domestic energy consumption in this period zhang 2013 all these accelerated energy consumption growth and then greatly promoted air emissions the declining indicator value during 2005 2016 is due to the establishment of an effective emission reduction mechanism by the chinese government including closing some enterprises with small production capacity high pollution and heavy energy consumption controlling coal production and consumption promoting use of clean energy sources increasingly strict supervision on energy saving and emissions reduction in each region etc all these measures vigorously optimize the economic structure and improve the industrial structure in the first four years of the 12th five year plan a total production capacity composed of 26 million kilowatts of small thermal power generation and 80 million tons of steel making and 300 million tons of cement was eliminated meanwhile 3184 paper making enterprises and 1467 printing and dyeing enterprises were closed down q wang et al 2015 especially after the air pollution prevention and control action plan was issued in 2013 j wang et al 2018 the chinese government reduces the air emissions from high pollution and high energy consumption industries by raising their environmental access threshold and speeding up elimination of their existing excess capacity for promoting clean energy utilization especially in those areas with serious air pollution the goal of negative growth of coal consumption was put forward to reduce the emissions of coal fired pollutants and the automobile exhaust was prevented and controlled by limiting the total number of motor vehicles in megacities improving fuel quality and strengthening the existing vehicle management wang et al 2016 the energy saving and emission reduction related policies and measures have improved chinese energy efficiency and reduced the emission intensity of energy use especially in the later period for the indicator ecpg fig 3 it decreased by 52 25 from 1989 to 1991 it increased by 89 44 during 1991 1998 it fell by 63 83 from 1998 to 2002 it rose by 87 50 during 2002 2005 it descended by 62 73 from 2005 to 2016 the indicator value decreased by 77 14 from 1989 to 2016 with an annual decline rate of 5 32 and it had an annual average value of 5 07e 09 sej cny during 2002 2005 china s economy grew rapidly after its accession to the wto fig 1 which rapidly promotes the intensity of air pollution due to extensive mode of economic growth caused by high energy consumption and high pollution industries to address the serious environmental issue the chinese government had to adjust economic structure and industrial structure j wang et al 2015 using some obligatory targets derived from energy saving and emission reduction during the eleventh five year plan period during the twelfth five year plan period chinese government focused on the implementation of 10 major projects such as emission reduction of major pollutants flue gas desulfurization of coal fired power plants etc which drove a significant increase in the amount of environmental protection investment in the country wang et al 2016 meanwhile the air pollution prevention and control action plan issued in 2013 also promoted china s investment of 2 trillion rmb in the field of air environmental protection which quickened the development of environmental protection equipment manufacturing construction and installation boiler technology transformation new energy vehicles and other related industries zhang et al 2015 all these measures moderately reduce the air pollution loss per unit of gdp in the later period as far as the index scd is concerned fig 4 it increased 3 39 times from 1989 to 1991 it decreased by 72 14 from 1991 to 1998 it rose by 6 65 times from 1998 to 2002 it fell by 71 56 from 2002 to 2005 it climbed by 3 15 times from 2005 to 2015 and it increased by 73 61 from 2015 to 2016 during the study period the index value was enhanced by 18 14 times with an annual increase rate of 11 55 and it had an annual average value of 5 45 the upward trend during 1989 2002 is mainly due to the rising proportion of tertiary industry in china jun 2006 in addition the implementation of the energy conservation law of the people s republic of china issued in 1998 improved the energy mix and energy efficiency at this stage national energy administration 2017 from 2002 to 2005 due to the deterioration of china s economic structure abnormal growth of china s heavy industries and inadequate environmental supervision x zhang et al 2014 after china s accession to the wto in 2002 the energy mix was worsen and energy efficiency was reduced which enhanced air environmental emission intensity at this stage li and lin b 2014 after 2005 the clearly rising index value is attributed to the continuous promotion of the energy saving and emission reduction and optimization of economic structure in the 11th and 12th five year plan moreover the index value rose significantly after 2015 indicating that the implementation of the 13th five year plan has further promoted structural coordination of china s economy due to the increasingly strict environmental supervision and the accelerated economic structure adjustment results from decomposition analysis sm c showed that eupg ecpe and ecpg have positive effects on scd during the study period of which ecpg is the largest contributor to this index in terms of the index shd fig 5 it climbed 95 62 from 1989 to 1991 it descended by 58 56 from 1991 to 1998 it rose by 1 29 times from 1998 to 2002 it fell by 63 97 from 2002 to 2005 and finally it increased by 45 22 from 2005 to 2016 along a slight fluctuation way during total study period generally the index value decreased by 2 70 with an annual decline rate of 0 10 this index value shows frequent fluctuation during the study period due to instability and low harmony degree of some policies and laws regulations weak supervision of the related measures hysteresis effect of some new policies and laws regulations complicated international situation etc generally the relationships between chinese economy energy use and its air environmental cost basically keep no changes from 1989 to 2016 and the trends of the index value differ from that of other ones to some degree in the same period e g the improvement rate of the index shd is obviously lower than that of scd in the study period at the same time the improvement speed of shd is much smaller than the growth rate of china s economy although part of the performance indicators have been improved the whole optimization of chinese economy is not obvious during the study period results from decomposition analysis sm c demonstrated that energy use has the most negative effect on shd during the study period and economic growth is the largest contributor to the index this shows that the energy use should be highly emphasized in the future it is worth mentioning that the implementation of the air pollution prevention and control action plan and related measures not only ensures the economic growth but also obviously reduces the air environmental cost and improves the structural coordination degree of chinese economy however these measures have not obviously improved the relationship between chinese economy energy and the air environment cost due to the limited time length of its implementation and its effect is worth further exploring in the future 4 2 empirical results of var 4 2 1 results of the unit root tests firstly to determine whether the sequences on chinese economy energy consumption and the air environmental cost satisfies the hypothesis that the variables in the cointegration test are monolithic and non stationary series of the same order eviews 10 0 software is used to carry out related adf unit root test for the three kinds of sequences respectively to eliminate the influence of dimension and heteroscedasticity natural logarithm value for each variable is used and here natural logarithm values of the gdp the energy consumption and the air environmental cost are recorded as lngdp lnene and lnec respectively the optimal lag period can be determined by sic table 4 reflects that lngdp lnene and lnec are non stationary time series at 5 significant level however the results from prob indicate that the first order differences of lngdp lnene and lnec are stationary at the 5 significant level since lngdp lnene and lnec have the same order sequence the var model can select the three sequences as research objects 4 2 2 the optimal lag order analysis after passing the adf unit root test the optimal lag order can be determined and it identifies five optimum lag orders table 5 therein the lag order with the most marked is the final optimal one for var model i e 2 4 2 3 johansen co integration tests next cointegration test is implemented to determine whether there is a cointegration relationship among the three parameters and then one can further eliminate the possibility of pseudo regression and then analyze whether there is a long term dynamic relationship between the three parameters since the optimal lag order of the johansen cointegration test is essentially the lag period of the first order difference variable of the var model so the optimal lag order of the cointegration model is 1 cointegration test results tables 6 and 7 based on both the trace test and the max eigenvalue test of the cointegration test respectively indicate that there is a cointegration equation at the 5 significance level this also means that there is a long term equilibrium relationship between lngdp lnene and lnec furthermore the related cointegration equation can be described using formula 8 it is found that there are positive correlations between china s economy energy consumption and its air environmental cost 7 lngdp 1 009490 l n e n e 0 311780 l n e c 15 59560 4 2 4 granger causality tests although there is a long term equilibrium relationship between lngdp lnene and lnec whether this relationship constitutes causal relationships between the three parameters requires further confirmation using the granger causality test according to prob values of the test results table 8 it is found that the null hypothesis that lnene does not granger cause lngdp and lnene does not granger cause lnec are rejected at the 10 significance level and the null hypothesis that lngdp does not granger cause lnec is also rejected at the 5 significance level therefore china s energy consumption significantly affects china s economic growth and air environmental cost and china s economic growth very significantly influences its air environmental cost 4 2 5 establishment of var model through unit root stability test cointegration test and granger causality test it can be concluded that the three variables meet the conditions of establishing var model the var model can be obtained using eviews 10 0 software to depict the interrelationships between chinese economy energy consumption and air environmental cost as follows 8 l n g d p l n e n e l n e c 1 421055 0 043031 1 795268 0 162034 1 267489 0 639480 0 013121 0 010914 0 730465 l n g d p l n e n e l n e c t 1 0 463886 0 102930 1 236676 0 117255 0 432713 0 904802 0 014836 0 045531 0 322896 l n g d p l n e n e l n e c t 2 0 072325 3 380976 21 49017 furthermore according to ar root stability test fig 6 it is found that all unit roots of the var model are in the unit circle 4 2 6 impulse response functions finally the impulse response functions can be adopted to describe the shock response ranges between chinese economy energy consumption and air environmental cost based on the established var model moreover it also reflects the dynamic impact of shocks on current and future values of dependent variables here when a positive unit size impact is given to lnene and lngdp respectively the impulse response function was shown in fig 7 as depicted in fig 7 a when a unit of positive pulse is given to the energy consumption the economy will grow substantially and reach its peak 0 03 from 2017 to 2022 and then gradually become stabilize this shows that on the basis of existing energy consumption chinese economy can keep rapid growth until 2022 with increasing energy consumption however the potential promotion of energy consumption will wear out after 2022 therefore the chinese government should also explore other driving forces for its economic growth in the future when a unit of positive pulse is imposed on the economy fig 7 b the air environmental cost will rise rapidly and reach the peak 0 05 from 2017 to 2019 and then it will gradually tend to become stable this shows that according to the current trend china s economic growth will simultaneously increase the air environmental cost in the next three years and then the positive effect on the air environmental cost will decline and tend to be stable in the later period as given in fig 7 c when a unit of positive pulse is placed on the energy consumption the air environmental cost will also ascend rapidly and reach a peak 0 043316 from 2017 to 2019 and then it will decrease rapidly and tend to stabilize this shows that chinese increasing energy consumption will obviously raise the air environmental cost in the short period and afterwards this kind of promotion effect will be greatly reduced and keep stable in summary it can be inferred that china s economy energy consumption and air environmental pollution are still positively correlated in the near future which shows that china s economic growth is still based on increase of fossil energy use and air environmental pollution from the results of impulse response china s economic growth are closely coupled with energy consumption and rising energy consumption will promote rapid economic growth in a short period meanwhile china s fast economic growth and energy use will bring a significant increase in air environmental cost which goes against the concept of sustainable development therefore improvement of part performance indicators does not obviously promote the whole optimization and the underlying reasons could root in conflicts between goals of different plans and diverse policy measures 5 discussion as shown in table 9 there are many similar trends of most of indicator values between this study and related works when considering the same study period however this study promoted related research field through 1 integrating environmental capacity and environmental emissions harm to biological ingredients into emergy accounting of emissions impacts 2 refining the existing indicator system describing relationships between economy energy and the environment using limited parameters 3 updating statistic data to reflect new situation of chinese social economy it is noted that other air emissions besides co2 nox dust and so2 have not been considered in this study due to data unavailability which could underestimate air environmental cost to some degree in addition the limited time scope of this study could incur some uncertainty which need to be further explored in the future however relative to other related studies this study can provide more reliable and timely policy making information due to consideration of corresponding environmental capacities and pollutants harm to ecological ingredients and updated basic data and thus it can better disclose general trends of relationships between chinese economy energy consumption and air environmental cost in this study period and trends of their interactions in next years in summary this study reveals that main obstacles hindering sustainability of chinese economy come from unreasonable energy mix and low energy efficiency followed by air pollution 6 conclusion and policy implications 6 1 conclusion chinese economic mix is obviously improved during this study period mainly due to reduction of air environmental cost per unit of economic output however no obvious improvement is seen in the relationship between chinese economy energy and air environmental cost in the total research period because contribution of economic growth is offset by negative impact of energy consumption increase energy consumption can significantly promote china s economic growth until 2022 and air environmental cost until 2019 and china s economic growth can very significantly drive its air environmental cost before 2019 afterwards promotion of energy and economy will become weak and then trend to be stable therefore chinese government should highly emphasized energy related issues and coordination between economy energy and the air environment in the future 6 2 policy implications regarding improvement of energy efficiency in the short term raising coal utilization efficiency should be emphasized through technical progress considering the leading role of this energy source in the foreseeable future especially in those industrial sectors highly relying on coal consumption such as thermal power industry cement industry steel and iron industry etc meanwhile coal chemical industry can be further accelerated to raise clean utilization level of coal and somewhat mitigate external dependence of crude oil in the long run development of clean and renewable energy sources should be vigorously promoted to solve related issues derived from fossil energy use although share of clean and renewable energy sources grew by an annual increase rate of 3 77 in this research period the hidden fossil energy use and potential environmental emissions in development of these energy sources have not been fully embodied in related policies and laws so related quality standards on clean and renewable energy sources based on its life cycle environmental assessment and life cycle cost should be formulated to ensure real cleanness and renewability and affordable cost of these energy sources to popularize use of these energy sources environmental benefit from them should be also fully quantified in terms of money and then act as one of important references of fiscal subsidy likewise environmental cost from fossil energy use should be quantified in units of money to guide environmental taxation only by this way can clean and renewable energy sources compete with fossil energy sources on equal terms related quantification methods based on a full life cycle prospect should consider natural contribution to economic activities and environmental emissions impacts on social economy while many related studies have been done to address these issues there are some flaws including inconsistency of factors and analysis boundary being considered lacking systematicness and logicality of methods being adopted unreliability of basic data and transformation factors etc and all these issues should be addressed through deep exploration in the future finally energy saving derived from management optimization should be continuously strengthened in all sectors through comprehensive strategy composed of administrative economic and educational measures specially advanced information technologies should be widely applied to management optimization in the process of energy production and energy utilization due to their real time capability and flexibility to control air pollution on one hand environmental capacity of nox and emission amount of co2 based on chinese obligation of emission reduction should be further improved and then assigned to each region as guidance of all kinds of planning on the other hand pollution prevention should be firstly emphasized through proper choice of raw materials and production process optimization and emissions reduction effectiveness of prevention and treatment measures should be carefully investigated from life cycle angle to find out those with net emissions reduction effectiveness as for economic growth chinese government has strived to adjust the primary industry and secondary industry through technical progress and management optimization and boom the tertiary industry especially those new industries based on information technologies such as artificial intelligence big data application etc however economic development planning of each industry should be based on energy supply and environmental capacity in different development phases of diverse regions to ensure good quality of economy in this respect china has gained some good experiences in recent years such as compelling transformation of economic modes through environmental quality promoting differentiated development modes in different regions through classified planning for territorial space implementing binding targets of energy saving and emissions reduction based on resources capacity and environmental capacity etc due to complexity of factors being considered and complicated space time characteristics in the country there is a long way to go for chinese government to properly deal with potential conflicts between economic growth energy saving and emissions reduction in the process of formulation of all categories of plans policies laws regulations and related practical application and all these issues will need continuous exploration in the future credit authorship

24532,all of the environmental conditions in nature act on an organism simultaneously however in experimental studies of the factors influencing metamorphosis each factor needs to be examined individually in order to disentangle its specific effects however it is challenging to then build properly integrated models which include data on all of the different factors evaluated in different experiments this study set out to develop a predictive model which could synthesize the results of several experiments on survival development and growth of natterjack toad epidalea calamita tadpole guilds the proposed population dynamic p system pdp model enables estimates of growth and development during the larval phase under different environmental conditions weather conditions predator density and pond characteristics and management the architecture of the model allows the inclusion of an indefinite number of parameters and interactions with all inputs interacting in parallel and enables solutions to complex modeling approaches using the model with a range of field data we found that the importance of predation pressure on natterjack toad tadpole guilds exceeds the potential effects of variations in temperature and precipitation the impact of introduced invasive predators therefore arguably poses the greatest threat to this species this type of model holds promise as a reliable management and conservation tool for this and other species especially where interactions between environmental factors make the impacts of individual factors difficult to predict keywords climate change metamorphosis p system population dynamics predation 1 introduction modeling population dynamics is complex since many processes operate in parallel and interact simultaneously every species has its own ecological peculiarities that usually vary as environmental conditions change and which are often altered by human interventions making it difficult to use the same model for different species natural processes are usually complex and non linear davison et al 2012 wu and david 2002 costanza et al 1993 therefore simple and intuitive analytical predictors of their outcomes are commonly inadequate holmes et al 1994 advances in computer science both in software and hardware have allowed the development of computational models that can integrate studies into complex problems balcan et al 2010 colomer et al 2014 brodland 2015 eckoff et al 2017 computer modeling methods that can simulate complex systems using mathematics and physics can incorporate a large number of variables to characterize the problem being studied bandini et al 2001 eckoff et al 2017 in the case of computational models a simulation must be run to validate and analyze the model the results of simulations provide predictions of the outcomes under certain given circumstances whether real or imaginary virtual experiments allow the identification of the most influential factors governing the results these approaches facilitate the prediction of future scenarios and can guide decision making by wildlife and conservation managers ordinary differential equations ode have probably been the most used models for the study of population dynamics despite their important limitations for example odes are deterministic models that use mean values without taking variability into account in population dynamics modeling there is a significant element of randomness mainly due to the spatial distribution and movement of individuals yuan and jing 2019 when stochasticity is introduced into models based on differential equations the complexity and variability of the results increases modeling using ode does not capture interactions at the micro level or allow the integration of qualitative aspects or individual actions into the model the population dynamic p system pdp model offers a global perspective and is also sensitive to the values of the initial parameters when the number and complexity of the processes to be studied increases differential equation systems become complex and take too much computing time to arrive at an analytical solution technological advances in the field of computing both at the software and hardware levels allow us to apply other alternatives such as agent or multi agent based abm models bonabeau 2002 marçal and north 2005 2009 gilbert and bankes 2009 abm allows an agent to be identified a discrete individual with a set of characteristics and rules governing its behaviors and decision making capability an agent is self contained and situated living in an environment with which it interacts with other agents an agent is goal directed having goals to achieve a p system is a computational model in the field of computer science that performs calculations using a biologically inspired process păun 1998 păun et al 2010 p system models are based upon the structure of biological cells and present in different variants ferretti et al 2003 such as pdp models pdp models have features in common with abm for example in pdp models an object agent is associated with each discrete individual and evolves depending on the properties of the environment it is in the same system can include different environments through which the agent can move and evolve during the process the properties of both the agents and the environment can change unlike classical abms agents in pdp models can evolve in an instant by executing more than one evolutionary process at a time different types of process can be carried out simultaneously with identical types of agents in pdp models many processes are executed in parallel sequencing the processes where necessary to facilitate the execution of the model however while pdps are not structured models they have some aspects in common with structured models geoffrion 2013 the great flexibility and potential of pdps makes their description difficult and they cannot be formulated mathematically colomer et al 2014 pdp models are powerful computational models and allow the study of complex phenomena affected by several processes which operate in parallel and which interact asynchronously with each other colomer et al 2013 pdps like all models that allow the study of complex problems require a large number of input parameters colomer et al 2011 2014 cortés avizanda et al 2015 margalida et al 2018 and can be considered to contain many simpler models inside them each of which requires its own input information metamorphosis is a complex process that determines the life cycle of certain animals laudet 2011 pdp models are able to capture the essence of this complex process and therefore allow the prediction of final outcomes under different scenarios the abrupt morphological and physiological transformations typical of metamorphosis are usually linked to changes in a species niche and represent critical transitions in an animal s life cycle wilbur 1977 werner 1986 choosing the right body size and timing for any stage of metamorphosis is crucial for an animal s success since these variables are key fitness components rowe and ludwig 1991 lind et al 2008 sufficient phenotypic plasticity to match the timing of metamorphosis with the demands of unpredictable or heterogeneous environments has been reported in numerous taxa laurila et al 2002 charmantier et al 2008 moczek 2010 sommer and ogawa 2011 amphibian tadpoles provide a textbook example of how the stages of metamorphosis respond to a variety of environmental factors wilbur and collins 1973 werner 1986 in the special case of pond breeding species temperature hydroperiod density of predators and competitors and food availability are important environmental triggers and some have been extensively studied denver et al 1998 morey and reznick 2000 van buskirk and saxer 2001 merilä et al 2004 oromí et al 2015 for example when ponds start to dry out some tadpole species invest more energy in development than in growth reducing their larval period at the cost of smaller size at metamorphosis richter boix et al 2006 márquez garcía et al 2009 when more energy is available because food is more abundant tadpoles can metamorphose earlier and at a larger size day and rowe 2002 lind et al 2008 enriquez urzelai et al 2013 well fed tadpoles can deplete food resources resulting in later metamorphosis of smaller tadpoles wilbur 1977 morey and reznick 2000 while high predation levels might reduce tadpole numbers and hence competition for food predation risk forces tadpoles to reduce activities such as browsing which usually results in a delayed metamorphosis pujol buxó et al 2017 although in nature organisms experience every environmental condition simultaneously in experimental studies the individual factors influencing metamorphosis need to be isolated experimentally this creates the challenge of predicting the outcomes of interacting factors when using data from studies which generally include two factors at most e g relyea 2004 the aim of this study was to design a model to predict the number of surviving tadpoles each day and the physical condition of each individual in the population we used the natterjack toad epidalea calamita as a study species to build and validate our model this species usually breeds in temporary ponds where tadpoles have to modulate their growth and development to adapt to a wide range of environmental conditions garcía parís et al 2004 pujol buxó et al 2016 2019a and provides a good model species to study the combined pressures of competition predation and desiccation risk in a tadpole guild we obtained the necessary data to validate the model from previous studies on the natural history of this species in the mas de melons protected area catalonia ne spain and from several laboratory studies on their larval development see materials and methods in this way we could show how empirical data on the same species taken from different studies and contexts can be successfully incorporated into a model to predict a species ontogeny we took tadpole growth and the stage of development as proxies and predicted the outcomes under a variety of biotic and abiotic variables since all the variables involved are random a probabilistic computational model emerged the components of the pdp model and the software created to run the model simulations are described in the materials and methods section this section also describes the processes and factors affecting the growth and development of the tadpoles being modeled the model obtained is general and applicable to a wide range of amphibian species and was validated using data from sanuy et al 2008 once validated the model was applied to data from the protected area of mas de melons spain under current conditions and then compared with different climate change scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 population dynamic p system pdp models pdps are probabilistic computational models inspired by the functioning of cells existing within an environment a tissue can be made up of several environments each one of them with a cell inside all the cells of a tissue having the same structure the agents move within the cells and in the environment when an agent is in the environment it can travel to cells in other environments all the cells of a pdp model have the same hierarchical organization which allows the generation of spaces with different properties that can vary over time the cell of a pdp model is represented by a rectangle fig 1 separated from the outside environment by the skin membrane inside the cell are different rectangles that delimit the interior spaces of the cell inside which different processes can be carried out inner membranes are identified by labels that can have either numeric or alphanumeric values as subscripts of the rectangles all the inner membranes have an electrical charge that can be positive negative or neutral 0 as a superscript that temporarily characterize the cellular subspace in pdp models the agents are denoted by a variable that can have four subscripts that store information about that individual an object type agent is associated with each different input to the model and to each individual for example in the case of the tadpole pdp model an object x i w i s y g i g is associated fig 1 to each individual in the population the subscript i indicates the age s indicates the size and g indicates the gosner status of that individual not all the objects that act in the model are associated with individuals there are objects associated with food f r and volume of the pond v not all types of active objects will intervene in the model at the initial instant and some can be generated during the model execution the objects evolve by means of evolutionary rules that describe the information observed in the real problem the rules have the following syntax r u ν i α f r u ν i α where f r is a probabilistic function associated with the rule if f r is equal to one then we omit it if in an area delimited by membrane i which possesses electrical charge α we find an object multiset v and in its father membrane we find an object multiset u the rule can be applied with a probability f r the application of this rule changes the polarization of the membrane from α to α and the multiset of objects u and v evolve to u and v respectively in pdp models the rules that can be executed at any moment are applied in a maximal and parallel way according to the existing resources the rules of evolution of pdp models describe the knowledge and information regarding the problem directly according to field or experimental observations pdp models take into account the average behavior and dispersion of the population through the probabilities associated with the rules and spatial distribution of the objects or agents there is a direct correspondence between the elements and their relationships in the real ecosystem and in the model a pdp model is complete when all aspects are defined environments cell membrane structure initial objects and evolutionary rules colomer et al 2013 provided some guidelines to define the components of a pdp model the modeler defines the components according to personal work preferences always trying to minimize the computational cost regardless of the path followed to define the model the results obtained will be the same a pdp model is a bottom up modeling process in which the macroscopic properties of the systems emerge from the relationships between the objects that make up the system making it possible to study a system from the point of view of the elements that make it up pdps are computational models whose analysis must be performed through simulations p lingua pérez hurtado et al 2019 is a programming language for membrane computing which aims to be a standard for defining p systems pdps are a particular case of p

well adapted for breeding in sunlit ponds with sparse surrounding vegetation and short expected hydroperiods pujol buxó et al 2016 2019a newly hatched tadpoles before they are able to feed themselves vary in size from 3 5 to 8 mm depending on egg size and embryonic period garcía parís et al 2004 temperatures must exceed 10 c if the tadpoles are to survive although they normally develop at temperatures over 20 c beebee 1983 sanuy et al 2008 due to the species sensitivity to environmental conditions the larval period and final size of tadpoles at metamorphosis can vary widely the relationship between growth and development being flexible we used gosner stages to quantify tadpole development gosner 1960 numbers are used to denote the various morphological stages of the egg gosner stages 0 19 and tadpole gosner stages 20 45 to the final metamorphosis into the adult gosner stage 46 since empirical data on growth predation competition and development are scarce before the tadpole morphology is reached gosner stage 20 our modeling starts from stage 20 the natterjack toad larval period is short and variable generally taking 24 54 days which is considered an adaptation to the unpredictable environments in which they breed banks and beebee 1987 gomez mestre and tejedo 2002 garcía parís et al 2004 pujol buxó et al 2019a the most important environmental variables affecting tadpole development are temperature sanuy et al 2008 álvarez and nicieza 2002 brattstrom 1963 precipitation richter boix et al 2006 garcía parís et al 2004 brady and griffiths 2000

which predicts the number of surviving tadpoles each day and their physical condition described by weight or length and gosner stage of each individual fig 2 an algorithm was defined taking into consideration the processes to be modelled fig 3 and the relationships between them although pdp models can compute the processes in parallel it is advisable to sequence them as long as it does not affect the final result partial sequencing makes it easier for the modeler to develop and control the model the temperature and amount of precipitation for each day were generated randomly using a normal distribution for temperature and a gamma distribution for precipitation the occurrence of precipitation being simulated using a 2 state markov chain precipitation or no precipitation the parameters of the distributions were estimated using historical records from the nearest meteorological station for both temperature and precipitation the distribution parameters varied each month regarding precipitation as well as simulating the probability and quantity of rain each day we also simulated the occurrence of bursts of consecutive rainy days the correlation between precipitation and temperature was not taken into account the model allowed the possibility of either keeping the pond water depth steady or changing it depending on temperature and precipitation conditions in the latter case the difference between the amount of precipitation and the evapotranspiration rate depending on temperature and the surface area of the pond was used to obtain daily water depth variations changes in pond water depth due to evapotranspiration were estimated broadly according to wilbur 1987 by 1 d 1 d a y t e m p p h r e a t i c s t a r t d e p t h s h a p e s t a r t d e p t h d is the

entered into the model was d i d i 1 t e m p 3 d i 1 2 d i 1 d i 1 t e m p 2 9 d i 1 the volume of water in the pond each day was calculated using pond depth 2 and area combining the volume of water with the number of tadpoles tadpole density was estimated and categorized as 0 1 2 4 8 16 16 tadpoles liter in the next step of the model the processes relating to tadpole nutrition and predation were executed in parallel the model allows a maximum of 10 different types of amphibian food cannibalism included and 10 types of predator the amount of food consumed by a single tadpole each day in the model depends on the type of food and the tadpole growth stage the number of tadpoles predated each day depends on the type of predator and the tadpole growth stage to conclude the loop fig 3 ran four processes in parallel assessment of tadpole growth if a tadpole has eaten it will grow it was assumed that the amount of growth depends on the temperature and tadpole density and not on the stage of growth of a tadpole the model allows measurement of growth by weight or length the user can choose the best metric based on the data available in each case if there is not enough food the tadpole may die the number of days a tadpole can live without eating depends on tadpole density and temperature changes in gosner stage the number of days needed to change stage will depend on tadpole density individual condition and current gosner stage assessment of food availability the available tadpole food changes as more food grows the increase of food will depend on the current available food and the temperature calculation of the water height of the pond using the expression 2 the parameters required for the model are shown table 1 the values of the parameters are entered into the console of

objects are used to save the information so that it can be retrieved in later steps object h i saves the information in the subindex i for a given water depth mm of the pond the v object allows the generation of objects associated with the pond volume 1 evolution rules the evolution rules are described in the supplementary information the objects in the spaces of the cell at each step and the changes of polarity of the membranes can be followed in figure s1 the model consists of 140 types of supplementary rules making 185 103 rules when displayed and the alphabet size is 9409 number of agents the model executes 22 step rule sets each 22 step loop being equivalent to the simulation of one day for each simulated day the model executes the loop shown in fig 3 the initial values for the loop for day i being the result of day i 1 i e the day before the final model contains several sub models interacting with each other so that the condition of each has an effect on the others the number of parameters required by the model is important because in some cases not all of the information was available in such cases the model can still be executed without problems and the results remain good and will improve as the accuracy and amount of input information increases 2 4 application and model validation the first task was to validate the model once validated it was applied to the mas de melons region to estimate the evolution of the tadpoles in different climate change scenarios a complete validation of the model was not possible because there was no data from a real case for which all of the information was available so a partial validation was performed sanuy et al 2008 conducted laboratory experiments using natterjack toads to examine the effect of temperature on larval development at experimental temperatures of 5 c 10 c 15 c 20 c and 25 c daily tadpole length and gosner stage were recorded each tadpole was housed inside its own individual pot with unlimited food and a constant volume of water changed regularly to run the model it was necessary to know the daily growth length as a function of temperature and the daily development as a function of temperature and the length of the tadpole in table 3 the daily growth length and increase in gosner stage are shown these data were obtained from observations carried out by members of our group in field studies separate from those of sanuy et al 2008 used to validate the model the number of days that the tadpoles can survive without eating or the loss of weight suffered if they do not eat were not taken into account this information could be entered into the model if there food limitations occur in the sanuy et al 2008 experiment sufficient food was provided daily during the sanuy et al 2008 experiment two variables were measured development starting at gosner stage 15 and tadpole length on hatching the study quantified the effect of temperature on embryonic development and tadpole size variation the experiment was stopped when gosner stage 45 was reached or when the tadpoles had not increased in length for 20 days and the gosner stage had not changed our tadpole pdp model was used to simulate the dynamics of 80 tadpoles with an initial length of 2 5 mm and gosner stages between 10 and 15 thirty repetitions of a 100 day period were simulated the results of our model daily length and gosner stage compared with the results obtained in the sanuy et al 2008 laboratory experiment are shown in fig 5 quantified percentage errors were estimated as follows p e r c e n t a g e e r r o r e x p e r i m e n t a l v a l u e m o d e l v a l u e e x p e r i m e n t a l v a l u e regarding the gosner stage table 4 the mean percentage error of the model did not exceed 8 5 while the errors in modelled length table 4 were slightly higher at 18 5 but less than the mean 2 5 application of the model in the mas de melons region the mas de melons is a natural protected semi arid area located in lleida in the north of spain it contains six ponds or reproduction zones where natterjack toads currently breed table 2 previous researches on natterjack toads in this area oromi et al 2010 sinsch et al 2012 have estimated the amount of toad spawn in each pond table 2 the average number of eggs in each spawn strand is 3500 for this species and when the tadpole density exceeds 1 individual liter the tadpoles have difficulty developing and many may die we carried out virtual experiments to assess tadpole growth and development in different scenarios using the pdp model developed above using data from the sanuy et al 2008 and oromi et al 2010 studies combined with climatic records from the observatory closest to mas melons we studied the effect of hypothetical climate change scenarios whereby temperature increased by 1 c and 1 5 c and average rainfall increased by 50 these scenarios do not represent any of the ipcc climate change scenarios finally we evaluated the effect of the presence of predators on tadpole growth and survival we found that common backswimmer notonecta glauca common darter sympetrum striolatum emperor dragonfly anax imperator and the red swamp crayfish procambarus clarkii all occur in our study area each species consuming from 0 1 to 0 9 tadpoles per day per individual predator pujol buxó et al 2017 3 results the results of the model validation daily tadpole length and gosner stage and the results obtained in the sanuy et al 2008 laboratory experiment are shown in fig 5 quantified percentage errors were estimated as follows p e r c e n t a g e e r r o r e x p e r i m e n t a l v a l u e m o d e l v a l u e e x p e r i m e n t a l v a l u e regarding the gosner stage table 4 the mean percentage error did not exceed 8 5 while the errors in length table 4 were slightly higher 18 5 but less than the mean applying the model to mas de melons showed that during our study precipitation did not make up for evapotranspiration losses and the pond water depths fell at first to 50 cm before the ponds dried out after 120 days table 5 if a pond dries out before tadpoles reach metamorphosis the tadpoles will die as the ponds dried some of the tadpoles died either due to the increase in tadpole density as the amount of water decreased or because of the decreasing levels of oxygen and food available less than 4 of the toad spawn laid reached gosner stage 45 under all of the combinations of climatic conditions modelled table 6 the plà pond is kept topped up as a management strategy to guarantee water availability for birds and livestock and was simulated with and without the addition of water that is either allowing the water level to fall or maintaining it at constant depth a slight increase in tadpole survival to gosner stage 45 was obtained when water was added artificially table 6 when modeling the rainfall at 50 higher than the actual average records the water depth at the end of the simulation was similar to that at the beginning and the number of tadpoles that completed metamorphosis was similar to that under average rainfall conditions simulating the inclusion of 20 individuals each of two different types of predator one type consuming 0 5 and the other 0 9 tadpoles per day decreased the number of tadpoles reaching the end of development in all of the various combinations of climatic variables table 6 in none of the scenarios modelled did the presence of predators entirely eliminate the tadpoles after approximately 40 days some of the eggs completed metamorphosis and reached gosner stage 45 table 7 leaving the pond to allow the remaining tadpoles to complete the cycle after 60 days 75 of the tadpoles had completed metamorphosis all of the ponds except cadolles still had water in them after 60 days fig 6 and a considerable percentage of the tadpoles in them completed metamorphosis given the volume of each pond concerned the average final length of the metamorphosed tadpoles was approximately 14 mm fig 7 growth in length is important during the first 60 days maximum length being reached after approximately 70 days by which time most tadpoles had reached gosner stage 45 table 7 individuals which were initially larger 12 mm reached gosner stage 45 more quickly by day 25 or 30 fig 8 after approximately 40 days when a considerable number of individuals had reached gosner stage 45 the average size of the animals reaching metamorphosis decreased to 10 mm although the average size increased to 14 mm again after 120 days 4 discussion anurans are among the most threatened taxonomic groups with a high percentage of endangered species and populations pyron 2018 sodhi et al 2008 in addition to the effects of habitat loss new threats such as invasive species and global warming are increasingly affecting their populations a model which brings together all of the available empirical data from disparate studies to predict a species growth and development can therefore help us to better understand the different effects of a variety of pressures on its survival and life history the natterjack toad is well adapted to breeding in ponds with a short hydroperiod its larvae tadpoles usually exhibit rapid growth and development but both can be modulated to adapt to a wide range of environmental conditions and pressures pujol buxó et al 2020 to better understand these interactions a model was designed to estimate their daily growth and development the model was applied to the mas de melons protected area predicated on environmental characteristics i e pond characteristics presence of predators and weather conditions all of the model inputs interacted with each other to shape the final outcome once validated the model outcomes produced acceptable errors considering the amount and quality of the data available these predictions should considered conservative since some possible factors such as pressure from interspecific competitors sharing ponds with the tadpoles were not considered in this version of the model temperature is an important environmental factor to which anurans are ontogenically and geographically adapted through for example phenotypic plasticity to survive a wide range of temperatures oromí et al 2015 and muir et al 2014 postulated that if the potential habitat of a species becomes warmer due to climate change that species would either succumb or be displaced by more heat tolerant species depending on its capacity to adapt in the case of the natterjack toad however low environmental temperatures e g 18 c are of most concern because they prolong the tadpoles development period and consequently increase predation risk in addition individuals appear unable to complete metamorphosis when water temperatures fall below 15 c this might suggest that global warming will benefit this species but climate change can be a double edged blade on the one hand tadpoles will grow faster and complete metamorphosis sooner at higher ambient temperatures and even suffer reduced larval mortality on the other hand however ponds might dry out more quickly under higher mean temperatures increasing competition for food and oxygen as ponds get smaller at the extreme mass mortalities due to desiccation may become more frequent our model supports the assertion that at least in our study area no significant differences in the number of individuals completing the larval stages would occur at any foreseeable increase in temperature the model suggests that equilibrium would be struck between the beneficial and deleterious effects of temperature increase it must be noted however that since our simulation data relates to a set of concrete ponds in a protected area these findings might not apply to other parts of the natterjack toad s range with different climatic conditions habitats and so on most of the organisms that undergo metamorphosis are especially vulnerable to predation during the larval stage wassersug and sperry 1977 arnold and wassersug 1978 the natterjack toad is one such species pujol buxó et al 2017 and therefore usually breeds in ponds with few predators preferring to face the risk of desiccation pujol buxó et al 2019a our results clearly highlight the importance of predation pressure on the tadpole guilds of this species which surpasses the potential effects of variations in temperature and precipitation it can therefore be argued based on our study that of all the risks that global change poses to anurans the possible introduction of invasive predators might be greatest for species that usually breed in temporary ponds and are already very sensitive to native predators a case in point is the introduction of the red swamp crayfish procambarus clarkii to temporary ponds in the doñana national park which has had a noticeably deleterious effect on the local amphibian populations cruz et al 2006 computational models allow several sources of data to be combined to compare the effects of several factors previously studied separately allowing researchers to model the combined effects of factors in the study of complex problems in this case our conclusions from the simple comparison between the future effects of two emerging extinction factors climate change and invasive species might not strictly require the addition of more information but the model would be more realistic and complex if more field data on the effects of competition tadpole density predator communities and weather conditions were added enriching the data included in the model should lead to more detailed predictions improve on the simple analysis made here and hopefully lead to better management decision making in protected areas credit authorship

24532,all of the environmental conditions in nature act on an organism simultaneously however in experimental studies of the factors influencing metamorphosis each factor needs to be examined individually in order to disentangle its specific effects however it is challenging to then build properly integrated models which include data on all of the different factors evaluated in different experiments this study set out to develop a predictive model which could synthesize the results of several experiments on survival development and growth of natterjack toad epidalea calamita tadpole guilds the proposed population dynamic p system pdp model enables estimates of growth and development during the larval phase under different environmental conditions weather conditions predator density and pond characteristics and management the architecture of the model allows the inclusion of an indefinite number of parameters and interactions with all inputs interacting in parallel and enables solutions to complex modeling approaches using the model with a range of field data we found that the importance of predation pressure on natterjack toad tadpole guilds exceeds the potential effects of variations in temperature and precipitation the impact of introduced invasive predators therefore arguably poses the greatest threat to this species this type of model holds promise as a reliable management and conservation tool for this and other species especially where interactions between environmental factors make the impacts of individual factors difficult to predict keywords climate change metamorphosis p system population dynamics predation 1 introduction modeling population dynamics is complex since many processes operate in parallel and interact simultaneously every species has its own ecological peculiarities that usually vary as environmental conditions change and which are often altered by human interventions making it difficult to use the same model for different species natural processes are usually complex and non linear davison et al 2012 wu and david 2002 costanza et al 1993 therefore simple and intuitive analytical predictors of their outcomes are commonly inadequate holmes et al 1994 advances in computer science both in software and hardware have allowed the development of computational models that can integrate studies into complex problems balcan et al 2010 colomer et al 2014 brodland 2015 eckoff et al 2017 computer modeling methods that can simulate complex systems using mathematics and physics can incorporate a large number of variables to characterize the problem being studied bandini et al 2001 eckoff et al 2017 in the case of computational models a simulation must be run to validate and analyze the model the results of simulations provide predictions of the outcomes under certain given circumstances whether real or imaginary virtual experiments allow the identification of the most influential factors governing the results these approaches facilitate the prediction of future scenarios and can guide decision making by wildlife and conservation managers ordinary differential equations ode have probably been the most used models for the study of population dynamics despite their important limitations for example odes are deterministic models that use mean values without taking variability into account in population dynamics modeling there is a significant element of randomness mainly due to the spatial distribution and movement of individuals yuan and jing 2019 when stochasticity is introduced into models based on differential equations the complexity and variability of the results increases modeling using ode does not capture interactions at the micro level or allow the integration of qualitative aspects or individual actions into the model the population dynamic p system pdp model offers a global perspective and is also sensitive to the values of the initial parameters when the number and complexity of the processes to be studied increases differential equation systems become complex and take too much computing time to arrive at an analytical solution technological advances in the field of computing both at the software and hardware levels allow us to apply other alternatives such as agent or multi agent based abm models bonabeau 2002 marçal and north 2005 2009 gilbert and bankes 2009 abm allows an agent to be identified a discrete individual with a set of characteristics and rules governing its behaviors and decision making capability an agent is self contained and situated living in an environment with which it interacts with other agents an agent is goal directed having goals to achieve a p system is a computational model in the field of computer science that performs calculations using a biologically inspired process păun 1998 păun et al 2010 p system models are based upon the structure of biological cells and present in different variants ferretti et al 2003 such as pdp models pdp models have features in common with abm for example in pdp models an object agent is associated with each discrete individual and evolves depending on the properties of the environment it is in the same system can include different environments through which the agent can move and evolve during the process the properties of both the agents and the environment can change unlike classical abms agents in pdp models can evolve in an instant by executing more than one evolutionary process at a time different types of process can be carried out simultaneously with identical types of agents in pdp models many processes are executed in parallel sequencing the processes where necessary to facilitate the execution of the model however while pdps are not structured models they have some aspects in common with structured models geoffrion 2013 the great flexibility and potential of pdps makes their description difficult and they cannot be formulated mathematically colomer et al 2014 pdp models are powerful computational models and allow the study of complex phenomena affected by several processes which operate in parallel and which interact asynchronously with each other colomer et al 2013 pdps like all models that allow the study of complex problems require a large number of input parameters colomer et al 2011 2014 cortés avizanda et al 2015 margalida et al 2018 and can be considered to contain many simpler models inside them each of which requires its own input information metamorphosis is a complex process that determines the life cycle of certain animals laudet 2011 pdp models are able to capture the essence of this complex process and therefore allow the prediction of final outcomes under different scenarios the abrupt morphological and physiological transformations typical of metamorphosis are usually linked to changes in a species niche and represent critical transitions in an animal s life cycle wilbur 1977 werner 1986 choosing the right body size and timing for any stage of metamorphosis is crucial for an animal s success since these variables are key fitness components rowe and ludwig 1991 lind et al 2008 sufficient phenotypic plasticity to match the timing of metamorphosis with the demands of unpredictable or heterogeneous environments has been reported in numerous taxa laurila et al 2002 charmantier et al 2008 moczek 2010 sommer and ogawa 2011 amphibian tadpoles provide a textbook example of how the stages of metamorphosis respond to a variety of environmental factors wilbur and collins 1973 werner 1986 in the special case of pond breeding species temperature hydroperiod density of predators and competitors and food availability are important environmental triggers and some have been extensively studied denver et al 1998 morey and reznick 2000 van buskirk and saxer 2001 merilä et al 2004 oromí et al 2015 for example when ponds start to dry out some tadpole species invest more energy in development than in growth reducing their larval period at the cost of smaller size at metamorphosis richter boix et al 2006 márquez garcía et al 2009 when more energy is available because food is more abundant tadpoles can metamorphose earlier and at a larger size day and rowe 2002 lind et al 2008 enriquez urzelai et al 2013 well fed tadpoles can deplete food resources resulting in later metamorphosis of smaller tadpoles wilbur 1977 morey and reznick 2000 while high predation levels might reduce tadpole numbers and hence competition for food predation risk forces tadpoles to reduce activities such as browsing which usually results in a delayed metamorphosis pujol buxó et al 2017 although in nature organisms experience every environmental condition simultaneously in experimental studies the individual factors influencing metamorphosis need to be isolated experimentally this creates the challenge of predicting the outcomes of interacting factors when using data from studies which generally include two factors at most e g relyea 2004 the aim of this study was to design a model to predict the number of surviving tadpoles each day and the physical condition of each individual in the population we used the natterjack toad epidalea calamita as a study species to build and validate our model this species usually breeds in temporary ponds where tadpoles have to modulate their growth and development to adapt to a wide range of environmental conditions garcía parís et al 2004 pujol buxó et al 2016 2019a and provides a good model species to study the combined pressures of competition predation and desiccation risk in a tadpole guild we obtained the necessary data to validate the model from previous studies on the natural history of this species in the mas de melons protected area catalonia ne spain and from several laboratory studies on their larval development see materials and methods in this way we could show how empirical data on the same species taken from different studies and contexts can be successfully incorporated into a model to predict a species ontogeny we took tadpole growth and the stage of development as proxies and predicted the outcomes under a variety of biotic and abiotic variables since all the variables involved are random a probabilistic computational model emerged the components of the pdp model and the software created to run the model simulations are described in the materials and methods section this section also describes the processes and factors affecting the growth and development of the tadpoles being modeled the model obtained is general and applicable to a wide range of amphibian species and was validated using data from sanuy et al 2008 once validated the model was applied to data from the protected area of mas de melons spain under current conditions and then compared with different climate change scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 population dynamic p system pdp models pdps are probabilistic computational models inspired by the functioning of cells existing within an environment a tissue can be made up of several environments each one of them with a cell inside all the cells of a tissue having the same structure the agents move within the cells and in the environment when an agent is in the environment it can travel to cells in other environments all the cells of a pdp model have the same hierarchical organization which allows the generation of spaces with different properties that can vary over time the cell of a pdp model is represented by a rectangle fig 1 separated from the outside environment by the skin membrane inside the cell are different rectangles that delimit the interior spaces of the cell inside which different processes can be carried out inner membranes are identified by labels that can have either numeric or alphanumeric values as subscripts of the rectangles all the inner membranes have an electrical charge that can be positive negative or neutral 0 as a superscript that temporarily characterize the cellular subspace in pdp models the agents are denoted by a variable that can have four subscripts that store information about that individual an object type agent is associated with each different input to the model and to each individual for example in the case of the tadpole pdp model an object x i w i s y g i g is associated fig 1 to each individual in the population the subscript i indicates the age s indicates the size and g indicates the gosner status of that individual not all the objects that act in the model are associated with individuals there are objects associated with food f r and volume of the pond v not all types of active objects will intervene in the model at the initial instant and some can be generated during the model execution the objects evolve by means of evolutionary rules that describe the information observed in the real problem the rules have the following syntax r u ν i α f r u ν i α where f r is a probabilistic function associated with the rule if f r is equal to one then we omit it if in an area delimited by membrane i which possesses electrical charge α we find an object multiset v and in its father membrane we find an object multiset u the rule can be applied with a probability f r the application of this rule changes the polarization of the membrane from α to α and the multiset of objects u and v evolve to u and v respectively in pdp models the rules that can be executed at any moment are applied in a maximal and parallel way according to the existing resources the rules of evolution of pdp models describe the knowledge and information regarding the problem directly according to field or experimental observations pdp models take into account the average behavior and dispersion of the population through the probabilities associated with the rules and spatial distribution of the objects or agents there is a direct correspondence between the elements and their relationships in the real ecosystem and in the model a pdp model is complete when all aspects are defined environments cell membrane structure initial objects and evolutionary rules colomer et al 2013 provided some guidelines to define the components of a pdp model the modeler defines the components according to personal work preferences always trying to minimize the computational cost regardless of the path followed to define the model the results obtained will be the same a pdp model is a bottom up modeling process in which the macroscopic properties of the systems emerge from the relationships between the objects that make up the system making it possible to study a system from the point of view of the elements that make it up pdps are computational models whose analysis must be performed through simulations p lingua pérez hurtado et al 2019 is a programming language for membrane computing which aims to be a standard for defining p systems pdps are a particular case of p systems in order to implement this idea a java library called plinguacore http www p lingua org wiki index php plinguacore has been developed as a software framework to simulate cell like tissue like spiking neuron like p systems and pdp systems mecosim membrane computing simulator http www p lingua org mecosim is a software based in plinguacore that provides a general purpose application to model design simulate analyze and verify different types of models based on p systems the software mecosim was used to execute the pdp models see supplementary material files 1 3 to run the model three files are necessary 1 an excel file that generates the simulator screens reads the parameter values and generates the outputs 2 a file with a pli extension that contains the model evolution rules and

individually and can be recovered to obtain an ecosystem photogram of the instant or instants chosen by the modeler 2 2 study species the natterjack toad is native to western europe and is considered well adapted for breeding in sunlit ponds with sparse surrounding vegetation and short expected hydroperiods pujol buxó et al 2016 2019a newly hatched tadpoles before they are able to feed themselves vary in size from 3 5 to 8 mm depending on egg size and embryonic period garcía parís et al 2004 temperatures must exceed 10 c if the tadpoles are to survive although they normally develop at temperatures over 20 c beebee 1983 sanuy et al 2008 due to the species sensitivity to environmental conditions the larval period and final size of tadpoles at metamorphosis can vary widely the relationship between growth and development being flexible we used gosner stages to quantify tadpole development gosner 1960 numbers are used to denote the various morphological stages of the egg gosner stages 0 19 and tadpole gosner stages 20 45 to the final metamorphosis into the adult gosner stage 46 since empirical data on growth predation competition and development are scarce before the tadpole morphology is reached gosner stage 20 our modeling starts from stage 20 the natterjack toad larval period is short and variable generally taking 24 54 days which is considered an adaptation to the unpredictable environments in which they breed banks and beebee 1987 gomez mestre and tejedo 2002 garcía parís et al 2004 pujol buxó et al 2019a the most important environmental variables affecting tadpole development are temperature sanuy et al 2008 álvarez and nicieza 2002 brattstrom 1963 precipitation richter boix et al 2006 garcía parís et al 2004 brady and griffiths 2000

which predicts the number of surviving tadpoles each day and their physical condition described by weight or length and gosner stage of each individual fig 2 an algorithm was defined taking into consideration the processes to be modelled fig 3 and the relationships between them although pdp models can compute the processes in parallel it is advisable to sequence them as long as it does not affect the final result partial sequencing makes it easier for the modeler to develop and control the model the temperature and amount of precipitation for each day were generated randomly using a normal distribution for temperature and a gamma distribution for precipitation the occurrence of precipitation being simulated using a 2 state markov chain precipitation or no precipitation the parameters of the distributions were estimated using historical records from the nearest meteorological station for both temperature and precipitation the distribution parameters varied each month regarding precipitation as well as simulating the probability and quantity of rain each day we also simulated the occurrence of bursts of consecutive rainy days the correlation between precipitation and temperature was not taken into account the model allowed the possibility of either keeping the pond water depth steady or changing it depending on temperature and precipitation conditions in the latter case the difference between the amount of precipitation and the evapotranspiration rate depending on temperature and the surface area of the pond was used to obtain daily water depth variations changes in pond water depth due to evapotranspiration were estimated broadly according to wilbur 1987 by 1 d 1 d a y t e m p p h r e a t i c s t a r t d e p t h s h a p e s t a r t d e p t h d is the depth of water mm day is the number of days temp is the average temperature in degrees centigrade phreatic is the soil moisture status 3 by default start depth is the initial depth of water mm shape is the shape of the pond curve 2 by default if in eq 1 the day is taken as the unit of work and we replace the variables phreatic and shape with 3 and 2 respectively the depth of water on day i d i entered into the model was d i d i 1 t e m p 3 d i 1 2 d i 1 d i 1 t e m p 2 9 d i 1 the volume of water in the pond each day was calculated using pond depth 2 and area combining the volume of water with the number of tadpoles tadpole density was estimated and categorized as 0 1 2 4 8 16 16 tadpoles liter in the next step of the model the processes relating to tadpole nutrition and predation were executed in parallel the model allows a maximum of 10 different types of amphibian food cannibalism included and 10 types of predator the amount of food consumed by a single tadpole each day in the model depends on the type of food and the tadpole growth stage the number of tadpoles predated each day depends on the type of predator and the tadpole growth stage to conclude the loop fig 3 ran four processes in parallel assessment of tadpole growth if a tadpole has eaten it will grow it was assumed that the amount of growth depends on the temperature and tadpole density and not on the stage of growth of a tadpole the model allows measurement of growth by weight or length the user can choose the best metric based on the data available in each case if there is not enough food the tadpole may die the number of days a tadpole can live without eating depends on tadpole density and temperature changes in gosner stage the number of days needed to change stage will depend on tadpole density individual condition and current gosner stage assessment of food availability the available tadpole food changes as more food grows the increase of food will depend on the current available food and the temperature calculation of the water height of the pond using the expression 2 the parameters required for the model are shown table 1 the values of the parameters are entered into the console of

objects are used to save the information so that it can be retrieved in later steps object h i saves the information in the subindex i for a given water depth mm of the pond the v object allows the generation of objects associated with the pond volume 1 evolution rules the evolution rules are described in the supplementary information the objects in the spaces of the cell at each step and the changes of polarity of the membranes can be followed in figure s1 the model consists of 140 types of supplementary rules making 185 103 rules when displayed and the alphabet size is 9409 number of agents the model executes 22 step rule sets each 22 step loop being equivalent to the simulation of one day for each simulated day the model executes the loop shown in fig 3 the initial values for the loop for day i being the result of day i 1 i e the day before the final model contains several sub models interacting with each other so that the condition of each has an effect on the others the number of parameters required by the model is important because in some cases not all of the information was available in such cases the model can still be executed without problems and the results remain good and will improve as the accuracy and amount of input information increases 2 4 application and model validation the first task was to validate the model once validated it was applied to the mas de melons region to estimate the evolution of the tadpoles in different climate change scenarios a complete validation of the model was not possible because there was no data from a real case for which all of the information was available so a partial validation was performed sanuy et al 2008 conducted laboratory experiments using natterjack toads to examine the effect of temperature on larval development at experimental temperatures of 5 c 10 c 15 c 20 c and 25 c daily tadpole length and gosner stage were recorded each tadpole was housed inside its own individual pot with unlimited food and a constant volume of water changed regularly to run the model it was necessary to know the daily growth length as a function of temperature and the daily development as a function of temperature and the length of the tadpole in table 3 the daily growth length and increase in gosner stage are shown these data were obtained from observations carried out by members of our group in field studies separate from those of sanuy et al 2008 used to validate the model the number of days that the tadpoles can survive without eating or the loss of weight suffered if they do not eat were not taken into account this information could be entered into the model if there food limitations occur in the sanuy et al 2008 experiment sufficient food was provided daily during the sanuy et al 2008 experiment two variables were measured development starting at gosner stage 15 and tadpole length on hatching the study quantified the effect of temperature on embryonic development and tadpole size variation the experiment was stopped when gosner stage 45 was reached or when the tadpoles had not increased in length for 20 days and the gosner stage had not changed our tadpole pdp model was used to simulate the dynamics of 80 tadpoles with an initial length of 2 5 mm and gosner stages between 10 and 15 thirty repetitions of a 100 day period were simulated the results of our model daily length and gosner stage compared with the results obtained in the sanuy et al 2008 laboratory experiment are shown in fig 5 quantified percentage errors were estimated as follows p e r c e n t a g e e r r o r e x p e r i m e n t a l v a l u e m o d e l v a l u e e x p e r i m e n t a l v a l u e regarding the gosner stage table 4 the mean percentage error of the model did not exceed 8 5 while the errors in modelled length table 4 were slightly higher at 18 5 but less than the mean 2 5 application of the model in the mas de melons region the mas de melons is a natural protected semi arid area located in lleida in the north of spain it contains six ponds or reproduction zones where natterjack toads currently breed table 2 previous researches on natterjack toads in this area oromi et al 2010 sinsch et al 2012 have estimated the amount of toad spawn in each pond table 2 the average number of eggs in each spawn strand is 3500 for this species and when the tadpole density exceeds 1 individual liter the tadpoles have difficulty developing and many may die we carried out virtual experiments to assess tadpole growth and development in different scenarios using the pdp model developed above using data from the sanuy et al 2008 and oromi et al 2010 studies combined with climatic records from the observatory closest to mas melons we studied the effect of hypothetical climate change scenarios whereby temperature increased by 1 c and 1 5 c and average rainfall increased by 50 these scenarios do not represent any of the ipcc climate change scenarios finally we evaluated the effect of the presence of predators on tadpole growth and survival we found that common backswimmer notonecta glauca common darter sympetrum striolatum emperor dragonfly anax imperator and the red swamp crayfish procambarus clarkii all occur in our study area each species consuming from 0 1 to 0 9 tadpoles per day per individual predator pujol buxó et al 2017 3 results the results of the model validation daily tadpole length and gosner stage and the results obtained in the sanuy et al 2008 laboratory experiment are shown in fig 5 quantified percentage errors were estimated as follows p e r c e n t a g e e r r o r e x p e r i m e n t a l v a l u e m o d e l v a l u e e x p e r i m e n t a l v a l u e regarding the gosner stage table 4 the mean percentage error did not exceed 8 5 while the errors in length table 4 were slightly higher 18 5 but less than the mean applying the model to mas de melons showed that during our study precipitation did not make up for evapotranspiration losses and the pond water depths fell at first to 50 cm before the ponds dried out after 120 days table 5 if a pond dries out before tadpoles reach metamorphosis the tadpoles will die as the ponds dried some of the tadpoles died either due to the increase in tadpole density as the amount of water decreased or because of the decreasing levels of oxygen and food available less than 4 of the toad spawn laid reached gosner stage 45 under all of the combinations of climatic conditions modelled table 6 the plà pond is kept topped up as a management strategy to guarantee water availability for birds and livestock and was simulated with and without the addition of water that is either allowing the water level to fall or maintaining it at constant depth a slight increase in tadpole survival to gosner stage 45 was obtained when water was added artificially table 6 when modeling the rainfall at 50 higher than the actual average records the water depth at the end of the simulation was similar to that at the beginning and the number of tadpoles that completed metamorphosis was similar to that under average rainfall conditions simulating the inclusion of 20 individuals each of two different types of predator one type consuming 0 5 and the other 0 9 tadpoles per day decreased the number of tadpoles reaching the end of development in all of the various combinations of climatic variables table 6 in none of the scenarios modelled did the presence of predators entirely eliminate the tadpoles after approximately 40 days some of the eggs completed metamorphosis and reached gosner stage 45 table 7 leaving the pond to allow the remaining tadpoles to complete the cycle after 60 days 75 of the tadpoles had completed metamorphosis all of the ponds except cadolles still had water in them after 60 days fig 6 and a considerable percentage of the tadpoles in them completed metamorphosis given the volume of each pond concerned the average final length of the metamorphosed tadpoles was approximately 14 mm fig 7 growth in length is important during the first 60 days maximum length being reached after approximately 70 days by which time most tadpoles had reached gosner stage 45 table 7 individuals which were initially larger 12 mm reached gosner stage 45 more quickly by day 25 or 30 fig 8 after approximately 40 days when a considerable number of individuals had reached gosner stage 45 the average size of the animals reaching metamorphosis decreased to 10 mm although the average size increased to 14 mm again after 120 days 4 discussion anurans are among the most threatened taxonomic groups with a high percentage of endangered species and populations pyron 2018 sodhi et al 2008 in addition to the effects of habitat loss new threats such as invasive species and global warming are increasingly affecting their populations a model which brings together all of the available empirical data from disparate studies to predict a species growth and development can therefore help us to better understand the different effects of a variety of pressures on its survival and life history the natterjack toad is well adapted to breeding in ponds with a short hydroperiod its larvae tadpoles usually exhibit rapid growth and development but both can be modulated to adapt to a wide range of environmental conditions and pressures pujol buxó et al 2020 to better understand these interactions a model was designed to estimate their daily growth and development the model was applied to the mas de melons protected area predicated on environmental characteristics i e pond characteristics presence of predators and weather conditions all of the model inputs interacted with each other to shape the final outcome once validated the model outcomes produced acceptable errors considering the amount and quality of the data available these predictions should considered conservative since some possible factors such as pressure from interspecific competitors sharing ponds with the tadpoles were not considered in this version of the model temperature is an important environmental factor to which anurans are ontogenically and geographically adapted through for example phenotypic plasticity to survive a wide range of temperatures oromí et al 2015 and muir et al 2014 postulated that if the potential habitat of a species becomes warmer due to climate change that species would either succumb or be displaced by more heat tolerant species depending on its capacity to adapt in the case of the natterjack toad however low environmental temperatures e g 18 c are of most concern because they prolong the tadpoles development period and consequently increase predation risk in addition individuals appear unable to complete metamorphosis when water temperatures fall below 15 c this might suggest that global warming will benefit this species but climate change can be a double edged blade on the one hand tadpoles will grow faster and complete metamorphosis sooner at higher ambient temperatures and even suffer reduced larval mortality on the other hand however ponds might dry out more quickly under higher mean temperatures increasing competition for food and oxygen as ponds get smaller at the extreme mass mortalities due to desiccation may become more frequent our model supports the assertion that at least in our study area no significant differences in the number of individuals completing the larval stages would occur at any foreseeable increase in temperature the model suggests that equilibrium would be struck between the beneficial and deleterious effects of temperature increase it must be noted however that since our simulation data relates to a set of concrete ponds in a protected area these findings might not apply to other parts of the natterjack toad s range with different climatic conditions habitats and so on most of the organisms that undergo metamorphosis are especially vulnerable to predation during the larval stage wassersug and sperry 1977 arnold and wassersug 1978 the natterjack toad is one such species pujol buxó et al 2017 and therefore usually breeds in ponds with few predators preferring to face the risk of desiccation pujol buxó et al 2019a our results clearly highlight the importance of predation pressure on the tadpole guilds of this species which surpasses the potential effects of variations in temperature and precipitation it can therefore be argued based on our study that of all the risks that global change poses to anurans the possible introduction of invasive predators might be greatest for species that usually breed in temporary ponds and are already very sensitive to native predators a case in point is the introduction of the red swamp crayfish procambarus clarkii to temporary ponds in the doñana national park which has had a noticeably deleterious effect on the local amphibian populations cruz et al 2006 computational models allow several sources of data to be combined to compare the effects of several factors previously studied separately allowing researchers to model the combined effects of factors in the study of complex problems in this case our conclusions from the simple comparison between the future effects of two emerging extinction factors climate change and invasive species might not strictly require the addition of more information but the model would be more realistic and complex if more field data on the effects of competition tadpole density predator communities and weather conditions were added enriching the data included in the model should lead to more detailed predictions improve on the simple analysis made here and hopefully lead to better management decision making in protected areas credit authorship

24533,the florida everglades is a vast and iconic wetland ecosystem in the southern united states that has undergone dramatic changes from habitat degradation development encroachment and water impoundment starting in the past few decades large restoration projects have been undertaken to restore the landscape including improving conditions for threatened and imperiled taxa one focus of restoration has been the marl prairie ecosystem where the federally endangered cape sable seaside sparrow ammospiza maritima mirabilis csss resides the csss is endemic to the everglades where populations have been steadily declining signaling the importance of decision support tools for natural resource managers for evaluating water management and restoration scenarios here we developed an ensemble logistic regression combining a frequentist and bayesian approach to model csss presence and measure how environmental factors such as hydrometrics fire occurrence and vegetation structure impact csss habitat suitability this is the first analysis to quantitatively assess the interdependent relationships between a broad range of environmental factors and csss presence across the landscape our results show that the probability of csss presence was highest in areas with dry conditions hydroperiods between 80 and 120 days percentages of canopy cover and woody vegetation less than 10 and more than six years post fire where 75 or more of the area was burned because the frequentist and bayesian models had nearly identical spatial outputs with the bayesian model having slightly higher validation metrics we used the bayesian approach as our final model eversparrow the results from our analysis can provide a valuable decision support tool as natural resource managers

although we have information regarding important ecological associations for the csss there exists no comprehensive quantitative ecological analysis in the peer reviewed literature that explicitly evaluates relationships between csss presence and environmental factors examination of the statistical relationships between environmental conditions and csss presence is challenging because of extremely low numbers of observations many surveys fail to detect sparrows leading to a zero inflated data set numerous analyses have been conducted on csss populations and habitat and three of the more recent tools csss marl prairie indicator csss viewer and sparrow helper are regularly used for restoration planning the csss marl prairie indicator uses hydrologic return intervals to model optimal hydrologic conditions on a multi decadal time scale pearlstine et al 2016 and the csss viewer and sparrow helper report summary statistics on hydrologic conditions for each of the subpopulations beerens et al 2016 u s geological survey usgs 2014 our csss presence model called eversparrow is the first analysis to quantify the interdependent relationships between csss presence and a broad range of environmental factors including fire history vegetation and hydrologic conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 population surveys the spatial extent of the study area covered all csss subpopulations mostly within enp fig 1 csss surveys were conducted via helicopter visits by enp staff to locations on a 1 km grid that encompassed potential sparrow habitat for more information on the survey protocol see pimm et al 2002 virzi et al 2017 observers waited 3 5 min after set down and recorded all csss calls detected over a 7 min interval within an approximately 200 m radius of the set down location csss surveys were conducted before 09 00 am and not performed in conditions of inclement weather or high winds we used csss survey observations march june 1992 2015 n 14 041 to evaluate the effects of a suite of environmental variables on csss presence 2 2 environmental predictors 2 2 1 variable selection before running our final models we used a bayesian variable selection approach to identify the most important suite of hydrologic and habitat predictors from a larger set of potential predictors to accomplish this we ran a bayesian logistic regression details in 2 5 modeling below where csss presence or absence i e non detection was modeled as a function of all potential predictors table 1 each predictor in this model was multiplied by a selection parameter that used a bernoulli prior which took on a value of 1 or 0 within each markov chain monte carlo mcmc iteration this effectively turns a variable on or off within the model during each iteration the posterior probability of each predictor specific selection parameter can be interpreted as the probability of inclusion hooten and hobbs 2015 royle and dorazio 2008 for environmental predictors where we expect the response to be quadratic all variables except easting northing and percent of cell burned we included the 2nd order term therefore all inclusion probabilities we report for each variable include both the linear and quadratic term the quadratic term was removed from the predictive model when the beta coefficient crossed zero we ran this selection process on the two data sets csss observations with and without pseudo absences details in 2 3 pseudo absences below and included any variables that had an inclusion probability greater than 0 5 using either data set table 1 2 2 2 hydrology for hydrologic predictor variables we used the everglades depth estimation network eden which provides daily interpolated water level surfaces over a large area of the freshwater everglades including our study area telis et al 2014 eden output is provided on a 400 m 400 m grid equivalent to 16 ha which we also used as the grid for our model to resolve the difference in grid cell resolution between the model and surveys we matched each of the csss survey locations to the 400 m 400 m grid cell it fell within because the model grid cell size 16 ha is larger than the measurements of csss territory size a range of 1 7 13 1 ha across subpopulations virzi et al 2016 we did not need to take additional measures to account for territory size we removed csss observations that fell outside of the eden footprint n 241 we used several packages in r r core team 2020 to translate eden data into our hydrologic predictors data table dowle and srinivasan 2020 lubridate grolemund and wickham 2011 ncdf4 pierce 2019 and reshape2 wickham 2007 first we downloaded the eden daily water level surfaces and subtracted the eden digital elevation model dem usgs 2011 to calculate daily water depths setting below ground values to 0 from the daily depths we calculated a set of hydrologic variables representing landscape processes that could potentially affect sparrow distributions including number of days since dry wet days 4 yr hydroperiod 7 and 14 day water recession rate cm day and maximum water depth cm table 1 recession rate for x days on day i was calculated as x r e c e s s i o n i w a t e r d e p t h i x w a t e r d e p t h i x where positive values indicate receding water depths we averaged these daily hydrologic variables over a weekly time step to study the effects of short term hydrologic processes on sparrow distributions because some hydrometrics required three years of prior data and eden data begins in 1991 csss surveys from years 1991 1993 were removed from the analysis n 2 682 to calculate 4 yr hydroperiod for the first year 1994 we took the mean of the three prior years to avoid having to remove an additional year of survey data 4 yr hydroperiod is the only hydrologic variable with an annual time step acknowledging that species respond to the environment dynamically by breaking up models into seasons or using temporally explicit variables can improve performance in species distribution models andrew and fox 2020 fern et al 2019 2 2 3 habitat we included percent tree canopy cover percent of woody vegetation and two fire disturbance related variables as non hydrologic habitat predictors in our models we identified percent tree canopy cover from the multi resolution land characteristics consortium s percent tree canopy cover data set 30 m resolution a part of the 2011 national land cover database u s forest service 2019 although landscape metrics can be incorporated into models using varying scales ortner and wallentin 2020 we resampled all of these metrics to the 400 m 400 m grid size typically used in ecological modeling in the everglades to resample the habitat data to the 400 m 400 m model grid we began by converting the cooperative land cover map version 1 1 developed by the florida natural areas inventory fnai and fwc 2010 into a binary classification of woody and non woody vegetation supplementary materials table s2 then for each 400 m 400 m grid cell we calculated the mean percent tree canopy cover and mean percent woody vegetation using spatial analyst tools in arcgis desktop 10 7 1 environmental systems research institute esri 2019 we identified fire disturbances using the ever fire geodatabase from enp which provides historical fire occurrence from 1983 to 2014 smith et al 2015 the database was compiled by combining digitized fires from fire scars found in aerial photography and recording coordinates of fires from reports to create fire boundaries we calculated the percent overlap between the fire polygons and each 400 m 400 m grid cell to create a spatial history of fire occurrence for our study area we used arcgis tabulate intersection analysis toolbox esri 2019 and the r packages tidyr wickham 2020 dplyr wickham et al 2020 and raster hijmans 2020a to calculate the number of years since last fire and the percent burned within each grid cell we carried over the percent burned within each cell for each year after a fire because burn effects on marl prairie habitat continue until vegetation recovers we set the maximum number of years since last fire to 10 and reset the rollover percent burned to zero after 10 years because marl prairie habitat typically recovers from a fire after eight years benscoter et al 2019 sah et al 2007 we removed csss surveys that occurred after 2014 the last year of the fire data set n 509 if fire was recorded in the same year and grid cell as a csss observation we removed that observation from the data set as we were unable to determine if the fire occurred before or after the observation n 331 2 3 spatial dependence we accounted for potential spatial dependence in the data by incorporating the easting and northing coordinates as predictors in our models although the csss has small territory sizes during the breeding season much smaller than the minimum 1 km between sampling locations very rare longer movement distances have been observed on occasion during the non breeding season dean and morrison 1998 the mean dispersal distance for juvenile sparrows is estimated at 0 577 km and the mean movement distance between successive breeding seasons for adult sparrows is estimated at 0 212 km lockwood et al 2001 thus we believe including easting and northing coordinates as predictors in our model adequately captured any spatial autocorrelation present within the data 2 4 pseudo absences csss survey effort was concentrated in known suitable habitat for the sparrow fig 1 leading to a small number of observations in habitat with low suitability to increase the models ability to discriminate between suitable habitat and unsuitable background we needed to maximize the range of environmental conditions and include more areas outside of the environmental range of the species chapman et al 2019 chefaoui and lobo 2008 using the packages dismo hijmans 2020b and lubridate grolemund and wickham 2011 in r r core team 2020 we created a random sample of biologically informed pseudo absence points in the freshwater sloughs sloughs are the deepest areas of everglades freshwater marsh and are normally inundated year round with over a foot of water lodge 2017 making them unsuitable for csss habitat we located all pseudo absence points in either shark river slough or taylor slough which are adjacent to known csss habitat and within the species dispersal ability fig 1 if instead we had used all grid cells without csss observations as pseudo absences the large number of additional absences would have artificially driven down the prevalence of the species leading to lower probabilities we sampled pseudo absence points at half the number of presence points n 944 because the csss survey data contain absence points and are already zero inflated chapman et al 2019 found that the number of sampled pseudo absences was not critical to model performance showing that there is flexibility in determining the number of pseudo absences the models were also run using absences exclusively from the survey data without including the additional pseudo absence points and these model outputs are presented in the supplementary materials 2 5 modeling 2 5 1 frequentist we developed two logistic regression models one using a frequentist framework and one using a bayesian framework for both models we standardized all predictor variables to a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 to assist with model convergence we ran the frequentist model using the glm function in r where csss presence varied as a function of all hydrologic habitat and spatial predictors to assess model fit we calculated model r2 using the performance package in r lüdecke et al 2021 we report tjur s r2 r2 for generalized linear models with binary outcomes tjur 2009 and 95 confidence intervals calculated with the stat package in base r 2 5 2 bayesian we ran the bayesian model within r using just another gibbs sampler jags plummer 2003 and the r packages r2jags su and yajima 2015 and jagsui kellner 2015 probability of csss presence was modeled as z i b e r n o u l l i p i where p i is the probability of csss presence and z i is the state 1 for presence 0 for absence at site i probability of presence on a site is modeled using the logit link function on the set of environmental predictor variables l o g i t p i α i k 1 k β k x i k where α i is the intercept at site i β k is the estimated coefficient for covariate k and x i k is the value of covariate k at site i all predictor variables were modeled using vague priors mean of 0 and precision of 0 25 we ran 20 000 iterations of three chains a burn in of 10 000 and a thinning rate of 10 we determined model convergence by a visual examination of the mcmc chains for proper mixing and confirmation that the r hat statistic measured 1 1 for all modeled parameters gelman et al 2014 predictors with 95 credible intervals that did not cross 0 were considered important within the model 2 5 3 model validation we assessed model performance using a spatial k fold cross validation process roberts et al 2017 where we split the data into eight folds based on the observation s location each observation was assigned to a fold corresponding to one of the designated subpopulation polygons see fig 1 or to the fold corresponding to locations outside the subpopulations we then trained each model while leaving one of the folds out as the testing data set we used the rocr package sing et al 2005 to calculate the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve auc for each fold allouche et al 2006 fielding and bell 1997 auc measures model accuracy on a scale of 0 to 1 where a value of 0 5 indicates predictive discrimination better than chance and a value above 0 7 is typically accepted to indicate an accurate model jiménez valverde 2012 zipkin et al 2012 we also calculated the root mean squared error rmse for each fold as an additional measure of model accuracy with rmse values closer to 0 indicating a more accurate model the mean values of both auc and rmse across the folds were taken as the model s overall measures of accuracy 2 5 4 ensemble modeling to create a consensus model and reduce model based uncertainty we used an ensemble modeling technique araújo and new 2007 marmion et al 2009 ensemble modeling assumes that predictions from both models describe possible states of a species distribution for our final prediction maps we calculated the weighted average of the probability of presence from each model using the average auc values as weights using the raster package hijmans 2020a in r all modeling and validation r scripts can be accessed at https doi org 10 5066 p9vnzh7i haider et al 2021 as well as model predicted surfaces csss survey data are not available owing to restrictions on location data for endangered species contact enp for more information 3 results model convergence was achieved for both the frequentist and bayesian models the tjur s r2 for the frequentist model was 0 21 the auc was 0 633 sd 0 05 for the frequentist model 0 641 0 06 for the bayesian model and 0 637 0 05 for the ensemble model the rmse was 0 335 0 17 for the frequentist model 0 337 0 19 for the bayesian model and 0 335 0 18 for the ensemble model eversparrow produced estimates for the relationship between the probability of csss presence and each environmental covariate and their associated 95 confidence intervals frequentist model and credible intervals bayesian model fig 2 environmental covariates that crossed zero were days since dry days since dry squared maximum depth and maximum depth squared in the frequentist model and percent canopy cover squared in the bayesian model we created response curves for both frequentist and bayesian covariate estimates holding all other covariates equal to their mean values fig 3 overall csss response to the environmental covariates is weak as expected for a rare species and a data set with high zero inflation the frequentist and bayesian response curves show consistent trends probability of csss presence decreased with increasing maximum depth percent canopy cover percent woody vegetation easting and northing probabilities were highest for dry conditions maximum depth of 0 cm for grid cells where percent canopy cover was less than 10 and for grid cells where percent woody vegetation was less than 25 for increasing number of years post burn and percent burned probability of csss presence increased probability of csss presence was highest after six years post burn and for grid cells where more than 75 of the area was burned for hydroperiod csss probability of presence was highest between 80 and 120 days csss probability of presence had the strongest response to the covariates for hydroperiod easting and northing the frequentist model displayed larger uncertainty in the covariate estimates than the bayesian model particularly for high values of maximum depth and percent woody vegetation we created maps of predicted csss probability of presence for the frequentist bayesian and ensemble models for five dates that show different periods march july of the nesting season fig 4 across all dates the bayesian predictions show higher probabilities of presence than the frequentist predictions for all models csss probability of presence is lowest toward the end of the nesting season in july probability of csss presence is highest in the southern part of enp in subpopulation b with decreasing values in c d and e and lowest values in subpopulations a and f subpopulation b is the only area with values as high as the 71 80 range probabilities in subpopulations c d and e reach the 41 50 range in subpopulations a and f probabilities rarely exceed 20 for the last date probabilities greater than 20 are mostly restricted to subpopulation b across all predictions probabilities do not exceed 80 4 discussion eversparrow revealed the relationships between multiple hydrologic factors habitat and fire history and csss presence in and around csss subpopulations we found that csss probability of presence decreased with increasing values of maximum water depth indicating that suitability is highest during the breeding season when there is no inundation additionally csss probability of presence was highest when the hydroperiod was between 80 and 120 days which agrees with research from ross et al 2006 showing optimal conditions between 3 and 4 months this result provides support at the lower end of the u s fish and wildlife service target of 90 210 days usfws 2016 with declining probability of presence with hydroperiods of 120 210 days these hydrologic relationships reflect prior findings from the literature that high water levels during the breeding season can cause loss of sparrow nests baiser et al 2008 or indicate unsuitable vegetation types for csss populations nott et al 1998 in addition drier areas may experience too high fire frequencies for marl prairie habitat to support csss populations pearlstine et al 2016 walters et al 2000 while csss presence showed a strong response to hydroperiod the 95 covariate estimate for days since dry crossed 0 indicating that long scale hydrologic patterns in inundation hydroperiod is a 4 year mean of an annual variable while days since dry is a weekly variable have a stronger influence on csss site selection than real time conditions the relative strength of hydroperiod may also reflect the importance of site fidelity or vegetation type and could imply that more recent inundation events may not impact csss site selection and potentially endanger nest success vegetation community composition is closely linked to hydrology and fire whereby vegetation groups are aligned along hydrologic gradients based on hydroperiod davis et al 2005 sah et al 2015 the modeled csss response to percent canopy cover and percent woody vegetation confirms the literature on csss habitat preferences for non woody vegetation with probabilities of csss presence highest at 0 for both percent canopy cover and percent woody vegetation prior research has found that sparrows avoid woody vegetation nott et al 1998 ross et al 2006 in preference for primarily muhly grass dominated marl prairie habitat davis et al 2005 elderd and nott 2008 eversparrow output shows an increase in csss probability of presence six years post burn and above and for cells where 75 or more of the area was burned optimal conditions of 6 10 years post burn is mostly confirmed by previous research showing optimal intervals at 3 8 years after fire kushlan et al 1982 post and greenlaw 1994 or every 5 8 years benscoter et al 2019 a longer optimal fire interval may indicate inundation in marl prairie habitat too rapidly after fire occurrence impeding vegetation regrowth sah et al 2009 the easting and northing coordinates were included in the model to account for spatial dependence in the csss observations model outputs show decreasing probability of csss presence with increasing easting and northing coordinates indicating that probability of csss presence decreases in the northern and eastern parts of the model domain for the northing coordinates we see this higher suitability in the southern areas confirmed within subpopulation b which has the highest csss population estimate usfws 2020 for the easting covariate estimate grid cells in the easternmost areas are over sampled relative to the number of csss observations as compared to the westernmost areas of the study area this disproportionate sampling pattern results in the model predicting higher probability of presence in western grid cells employing both a frequentist and bayesian approach allowed us to build an ensemble model that uses inference from both frameworks while the auc is almost equal for both models different information is derived from each the frequentist confidence interval provides a uniform range in which there is a 95 certainty in the results versus the more informative bayesian credible interval in which a non uniform probability function is found within a 95 probability interval these two approaches result in some differences in the response curves such as the estimated relationships between csss presence and woody vegetation and csss presence and maximum water depth because the csss survey data are zero inflated the vague priors influence the parameter estimates banner et al 2020 resulting in a tighter credible interval from the bayesian model than the confidence interval for the frequentist model we expected that the ensemble model would weigh and reconcile differences of the spatial distributions of csss probabilities of presence resulting from the two modeling approaches in this case the two modeling approaches resulted in nearly identical spatial mapping though the bayesian model resulted in an improved range with somewhat higher probabilities in the core of subpopulation b and lower probabilities in the sloughs and western subpopulation a the largely similar results between the two modeling approaches are not necessarily surprising given that the bayesian model was directly analogous to the frequentist model and used weak or vague priors because the two modeling approaches provided similar results and the ensemble model did not provide increased performance we will exclusively use the bayesian model as eversparrow because of its higher auc value the posterior distributions that describe the relationship of csss presence to environmental predictors could be used in a future modeling effort as informative priors to strengthen our understanding of these relationships given additional data collection banner et al 2020 the csss survey data show population estimates in decreasing order with subpopulation b with the highest population estimate followed by e with subpopulations a c d and f having relatively low bird counts usfws 2020 maps showing eversparrow predicted probabilities are consistent with these survey data subpopulation b has the highest predicted probabilities and the highest number of recorded presences across all years the smallest predicted probabilities are in subpopulations a and f which since 2000 have had fewer than 25 and 5 recorded presences respectively in any individual year the predicted probability maps show similar values across subpopulations e c and d high predicted probability of presence values may indicate high quality habitat where sparrow populations are limited by dispersal or struggling to recover from prior severe population losses such as in subpopulation a after high water levels 1993 1996 nott et al 1998 in addition the prediction maps show high csss probability of presence in areas around the delineated subpopulations high probabilities occur along the enp main road between subpopulations e and b southwest of subpopulation d and east of taylor slough and along the eastern border of subpopulation b all areas outside of designated subpopulations but with higher probabilities than those found in subpopulations a or f this result highlights possible shifting hydrologic patterns in the everglades because of restoration and changing hydrologic management the density of scattered woody vegetation between some of the eastern subpopulations reduces the probabilities of csss presence but as hydrologic changes continue and restoration reduces woody vegetation suitable csss habitat may expand to these new locations eversparrow shows high probability of presence as early as march when csss surveys begin indicating a possible benefit to expanding csss survey dates into february while surveys are conducted march through june prior observations have indicated nesting may begin as early as february 15th van lent et al 1999 one of the major stressors to the marl prairie habitat and thus csss populations is prior water movement across the landscape including changes such as altered hydrologic patterns that result in shortened hydroperiods and increased drought severity in some areas but extended hydroperiods and drying pattern reversals in others davis et al 2005 these threats are reflected in csss habitat where subpopulations vary between too wet and too dry depending on historical hydrologic alteration and management operations sah et al 2019 our model quantifies the interdependent relationships between sparrow presence and hydrologic patterns and is applicable to water management actions to reduce threats and improve csss habitat suitability eversparrow is available online at jem gov modeling eversparrow as part of a suite of everglades restoration tools in the joint ecosystem modeling jem program a collaboration among restoration partners and led by usgs that supports planning and decision making in the greater everglades eversparrow is also run monthly as part of jem s everforecast application pearlstine et al 2020 where model output can be easily accessed and viewed for near term hydrologic forecasts at jem gov everforecast these user friendly platforms increase the utility of eversparrow as a decision support tool and can help natural resource managers adapt in real time to changing environmental conditions in support of csss recovery understanding the most important factors related to csss presence is critical to monitoring and attaining recovery objectives for the csss including maintaining and restoring functional csss habitat achieving demographic recovery criteria and achieving population numbers essential for recovery usfws 1999 usfws 2010 our modeling efforts help decipher the factors important to csss population recovery one recovery criterion is to sustain a minimum population of 6 600 for an average of five years but population estimates have not crossed this minimum threshold since 1981 usfws 2010 these numbers emphasize the importance of understanding the relationships between sparrow presence and environmental factors and how management and restoration actions affect csss populations many factors impede recovery and contribute to csss population declines and primary threats include changes in hydrologic management as captured in eversparrow and broader landscape issues that should be considered in future models or decision support tools including habitat loss from agricultural encroachment and urban development davis et al 2005 introduced predators e g pythons and tegus usfws 2020 climate change pearlstine et al 2009 usfws 2020 water quality degradation e g increased phosphorus from agricultural and urban sources naja et al 2017 and methylmercury contamination rumbold et al 2008 limitations to eversparrow begin with the survey data species prevalence impacts the performance and thus utility of species distribution models lawson et al 2014 manel et al 2001 threatened and rare species such as the csss have low prevalence often leading to zero inflated data sets and causing prediction maps and response curves to consistently predict low probabilities of presence while these low values may accurately reflect the rarity of the csss it makes suitable habitat difficult to differentiate from background this is reflected in our model performance metrics aucs for all three models hovered below 0 7 and the rmse values indicated 30 error in predicting species presence these results are attributable to the spatial cross validation procedure we used assessing performance without acknowledging the spatial structure present in the data would have produced overly optimistic performance results and more confidence in the models predictive power than warranted ploton et al 2020 roberts et al 2017 an additional limitation is that the csss survey data were not collected using a double observer method and so we were not able to account for detection of the species because of this our model parameter estimates are likely biased and confidence or credible intervals appear smaller than they likely are kéry and schmidt 2008 future work to improve csss modeling could include a more detailed integration of vegetation type and incorporation of microtopographic variation averaging hydrologic conditions across a 400 m grid provides us with only a coarse understanding of optimal conditions using new high resolution lidar imagery a vegetation classification could be used to improve model predictions instead of relying on environmental conditions as proxies for vegetation type new digital elevation models at extremely high resolutions 0 5 m are being completed and tested for enp based on 2017 2020 lidar 5 conclusions unoccupied niche and zero inflated data are challenges when modeling the sparse populations of the endangered csss our approach successfully provides a quantitative assessment of multiple environmental predictors to aid in understanding the factors affecting csss presence in the landscape our application of two logistic regressions to modeling the probability of csss presence resulted in close agreement between the models but with the bayesian approach demonstrating a slightly higher auc value the ensemble therefore did not provide improved confidence and we moved forward with just using the bayesian model as eversparrow the bayesian model offers the additional advantage of improved quantitative understanding of variable relation uncertainties and using the posterior distributions as informative priors for any future modeling efforts as the first approach to quantify the interdependent relationships between a range of environmental factors and csss presence this model expands the tools available to decision makers in the everglades to evaluate water management and restoration scenarios an advantage of the bayesian approach is that we can introduce probability distributions of any environmental predictor quantitatively or qualitatively derived to these unknown futures csss populations face significant impacts from everglades restoration changes to their marl prairie habitat eversparrow allows users to evaluate the spatial and temporal potential response of the csss to changes in hydrology fire and vegetation within and adjacent to the unique marl prairie community credit authorship contribution statement saira

24533,the florida everglades is a vast and iconic wetland ecosystem in the southern united states that has undergone dramatic changes from habitat degradation development encroachment and water impoundment starting in the past few decades large restoration projects have been undertaken to restore the landscape including improving conditions for threatened and imperiled taxa one focus of restoration has been the marl prairie ecosystem where the federally endangered cape sable seaside sparrow ammospiza maritima mirabilis csss resides the csss is endemic to the everglades where populations have been steadily declining signaling the importance of decision support tools for natural resource managers for evaluating water management and restoration scenarios here we developed an ensemble logistic regression combining a frequentist and bayesian approach to model csss presence and measure how environmental factors such as hydrometrics fire occurrence and vegetation structure impact csss habitat suitability this is the first analysis to quantitatively assess the interdependent relationships between a broad range of environmental factors and csss presence across the landscape our results show that the probability of csss presence was highest in areas with dry conditions hydroperiods between 80 and 120 days percentages of canopy cover and woody vegetation less than 10 and more than six years post fire where 75 or more of the area was burned because the frequentist and bayesian models had nearly identical spatial outputs with the bayesian model having slightly higher validation metrics we used the bayesian approach as our final model eversparrow the results from our analysis can provide a valuable decision support tool as natural resource managers

burns and suppressing fire where a catastrophic burn could threaten csss populations in the short term usfws 2016 observational evidence shows that sparrows may benefit from periodic fires where benefits to the sparrow population were observed 3 8 years after fire werner and woolfenden 1983 and a more recent study showed that optimal fire intervals occur every 5 8 years benscoter et al 2019 although we have information regarding important ecological associations for the csss there exists no comprehensive quantitative ecological analysis in the peer reviewed literature that explicitly evaluates relationships between csss presence and environmental factors examination of the statistical relationships between environmental conditions and csss presence is challenging because of extremely low numbers of observations many surveys fail to detect sparrows leading to a zero inflated data set numerous analyses have been conducted on csss populations and habitat and three of the more recent tools csss marl prairie indicator csss viewer and sparrow helper are regularly used for restoration planning the csss marl prairie indicator uses hydrologic return intervals to model optimal hydrologic conditions on a multi decadal time scale pearlstine et al 2016 and the csss viewer and sparrow helper report summary statistics on hydrologic conditions for each of the subpopulations beerens et al 2016 u s geological survey usgs 2014 our csss presence model called eversparrow is the first analysis to quantify the interdependent relationships between csss presence and a broad range of environmental factors including fire history vegetation and hydrologic conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 population surveys the spatial extent of the study area covered all csss subpopulations mostly within enp fig 1 csss surveys were conducted via helicopter visits by enp staff to locations on a 1 km grid that encompassed potential sparrow habitat for more information on the survey protocol see pimm et al 2002 virzi et al 2017 observers waited 3 5 min after set down and recorded all csss calls detected over a 7 min interval within an approximately 200 m radius of the set down location csss surveys were conducted before 09 00 am and not performed in conditions of inclement weather or high winds we used csss survey observations march june 1992 2015 n 14 041 to evaluate the effects of a suite of environmental variables on csss presence 2 2 environmental predictors 2 2 1 variable selection before running our final models we used a bayesian variable selection approach to identify the most important suite of hydrologic and habitat predictors from a larger set of potential predictors to accomplish this we ran a bayesian logistic regression details in 2 5 modeling below where csss presence or absence i e non detection was modeled as a function of all potential predictors table 1 each predictor in this model was multiplied by a selection parameter that used a bernoulli prior which took on a value of 1 or 0 within each markov chain monte carlo mcmc iteration this effectively turns a variable on or off within the model during each iteration the posterior probability of each predictor specific selection parameter can be interpreted as the probability of inclusion hooten and hobbs 2015 royle and dorazio 2008 for environmental predictors where we expect the response to be quadratic all variables except easting northing and percent of cell burned we included the 2nd order term therefore all inclusion probabilities we report for each variable include both the linear and quadratic term the quadratic term was removed from the predictive model when the beta coefficient crossed zero we ran this selection process on the two data sets csss observations with and without pseudo absences details in 2 3 pseudo absences below and included any variables that had an inclusion probability greater than 0 5 using either data set table 1 2 2 2 hydrology for hydrologic predictor variables we used the everglades depth estimation network eden which provides daily interpolated water level surfaces over a large area of the freshwater everglades including our study area telis et al 2014 eden output is provided on a 400 m 400 m grid equivalent to 16 ha which we also used as the grid for our model to resolve the difference in grid cell resolution between the model and surveys we matched each of the csss survey locations to the 400 m 400 m grid cell it fell within because the model grid cell size 16 ha is larger than the measurements of csss territory size a range of 1 7 13 1 ha across subpopulations virzi et al 2016 we did not need to take additional measures to account for territory size we removed csss observations that fell outside of the eden footprint n 241 we used several packages in r r core team 2020 to translate eden data into our hydrologic predictors data table dowle and srinivasan 2020 lubridate grolemund and wickham 2011 ncdf4 pierce 2019 and reshape2 wickham 2007 first we downloaded the eden daily water level surfaces and subtracted the eden digital elevation model dem usgs 2011 to calculate daily water depths setting below ground values to 0 from the daily depths we calculated a set of hydrologic variables representing landscape processes that could potentially affect sparrow distributions including number of days since dry wet days 4 yr hydroperiod 7 and 14 day water recession rate cm day and maximum water depth cm table 1 recession rate for x days on day i was calculated as x r e c e s s i o n i w a t e r d e p t h i x w a t e r d e p t h i x where positive values indicate receding water depths we averaged these daily hydrologic variables over a weekly time step to study the effects of short term hydrologic processes on sparrow distributions because some hydrometrics required three years of prior data and eden data begins in 1991 csss surveys from years 1991 1993 were removed from the analysis n 2 682 to calculate 4 yr hydroperiod for the first year 1994 we took the mean of the three prior years to avoid having to remove an additional year of survey data 4 yr hydroperiod is the only hydrologic variable with an annual time step acknowledging that species respond to the environment dynamically by breaking up models into seasons or using temporally explicit variables can improve performance in species distribution models andrew and fox 2020 fern et al 2019 2 2 3 habitat we included percent tree canopy cover percent of woody vegetation and two fire disturbance related variables as non hydrologic habitat predictors in our models we identified percent tree canopy cover from the multi resolution land characteristics consortium s percent tree canopy cover data set 30 m resolution a part of the 2011 national land cover database u s forest service 2019 although landscape metrics can be incorporated into models using varying scales ortner and wallentin 2020 we resampled all of these metrics to the 400 m 400 m grid size typically used in ecological modeling in the everglades to resample the habitat data to the 400 m 400 m model grid we began by converting the cooperative land cover map version 1 1 developed by the florida natural areas inventory fnai and fwc 2010 into a binary classification of woody and non woody vegetation supplementary materials table s2 then for each 400 m 400 m grid cell we calculated the mean percent tree canopy cover and mean percent woody vegetation using spatial analyst tools in arcgis desktop 10 7 1 environmental systems research institute esri 2019 we identified fire disturbances using the ever fire geodatabase from enp which provides historical fire occurrence from 1983 to 2014 smith et al 2015 the database was compiled by combining digitized fires from fire scars found in aerial photography and recording coordinates of fires from reports to create fire boundaries we calculated the percent overlap between the fire polygons and each 400 m 400 m grid cell to create a spatial history of fire occurrence for our study area we used arcgis tabulate intersection analysis toolbox esri 2019 and the r packages tidyr wickham 2020 dplyr wickham et al 2020 and raster hijmans 2020a to calculate the number of years since last fire and the percent burned within each grid cell we carried over the percent burned within each cell for each year after a fire because burn effects on marl prairie habitat continue until vegetation recovers we set the maximum number of years since last fire to 10 and reset the rollover percent burned to zero after 10 years because marl prairie habitat typically recovers from a fire after eight years benscoter et al 2019 sah et al 2007 we removed csss surveys that occurred after 2014 the last year of the fire data set n 509 if fire was recorded in the same year and grid cell as a csss observation we removed that observation from the data set as we were unable to determine if the fire occurred before or after the observation n 331 2 3 spatial dependence we accounted for potential spatial dependence in the data by incorporating the easting and northing coordinates as predictors in our models although the csss has small territory sizes during the breeding season much smaller than the minimum 1 km between sampling locations very rare longer movement distances have been observed on occasion during the non breeding season dean and morrison 1998 the mean dispersal distance for juvenile sparrows is estimated at 0 577 km and the mean movement distance between successive breeding seasons for adult sparrows is estimated at 0 212 km lockwood et al 2001 thus we believe including easting and northing coordinates as predictors in our model adequately captured any spatial autocorrelation present within the data 2 4 pseudo absences csss survey effort was concentrated in known suitable habitat for the sparrow fig 1 leading to a small number of observations in habitat with low suitability to increase the models ability to discriminate between suitable habitat and unsuitable background we needed to maximize the range of environmental conditions and include more areas outside of the environmental range of the species chapman et al 2019 chefaoui and lobo 2008 using the packages dismo hijmans 2020b and lubridate grolemund and wickham 2011 in r r core team 2020 we created a random sample of biologically informed pseudo absence points in the freshwater sloughs sloughs are the deepest areas of everglades freshwater marsh and are normally inundated year round with over a foot of water lodge 2017 making them unsuitable for csss habitat we located all pseudo absence points in either shark river slough or taylor slough which are adjacent to known csss habitat and within the species dispersal ability fig 1 if instead we had used all grid cells without csss observations as pseudo absences the large number of additional absences would have artificially driven down the prevalence of the species leading to lower probabilities we sampled pseudo absence points at half the number of presence points n 944 because the csss survey data contain absence points and are already zero inflated chapman et al 2019 found that the number of sampled pseudo absences was not critical to model performance showing that there is flexibility in determining the number of pseudo absences the models were also run using absences exclusively from the survey data without including the additional pseudo absence points and these model outputs are presented in the supplementary materials 2 5 modeling 2 5 1 frequentist we developed two logistic regression models one using a frequentist framework and one using a bayesian framework for both models we standardized all predictor variables to a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 to assist with model convergence we ran the frequentist model using the glm function in r where csss presence varied as a function of all hydrologic habitat and spatial predictors to assess model fit we calculated model r2 using the performance package in r lüdecke et al 2021 we report tjur s r2 r2 for generalized linear models with binary outcomes tjur 2009 and 95 confidence intervals calculated with the stat package in base r 2 5 2 bayesian we ran the bayesian model within r using just another gibbs sampler jags plummer 2003 and the r packages r2jags su and yajima 2015 and jagsui kellner 2015 probability of csss presence was modeled as z i b e r n o u l l i p i where p i is the probability of csss presence and z i is the state 1 for presence 0 for absence at site i probability of presence on a site is modeled using the logit link function on the set of environmental predictor variables l o g i t p i α i k 1 k β k x i k where α i is the intercept at site i β k is the estimated coefficient for covariate k and x i k is the value of covariate k at site i all predictor variables were modeled using vague priors mean of 0 and precision of 0 25 we ran 20 000 iterations of three chains a burn in of 10 000 and a thinning rate of 10 we determined model convergence by a visual examination of the mcmc chains for proper mixing and confirmation that the r hat statistic measured 1 1 for all modeled parameters gelman et al 2014 predictors with 95 credible intervals that did not cross 0 were considered important within the model 2 5 3 model validation we assessed model performance using a spatial k fold cross validation process roberts et al 2017 where we split the data into eight folds based on the observation s location each observation was assigned to a fold corresponding to one of the designated subpopulation polygons see fig 1 or to the fold corresponding to locations outside the subpopulations we then trained each model while leaving one of the folds out as the testing data set we used the rocr package sing et al 2005 to calculate the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve auc for each fold allouche et al 2006 fielding and bell 1997 auc measures model accuracy on a scale of 0 to 1 where a value of 0 5 indicates predictive discrimination better than chance and a value above 0 7 is typically accepted to indicate an accurate model jiménez valverde 2012 zipkin et al 2012 we also calculated the root mean squared error rmse for each fold as an additional measure of model accuracy with rmse values closer to 0 indicating a more accurate model the mean values of both auc and rmse across the folds were taken as the model s overall measures of accuracy 2 5 4 ensemble modeling to create a consensus model and reduce model based uncertainty we used an ensemble modeling technique araújo and new 2007 marmion et al 2009 ensemble modeling assumes that predictions from both models describe possible states of a species distribution for our final prediction maps we calculated the weighted average of the probability of presence from each model using the average auc values as weights using the raster package hijmans 2020a in r all modeling and validation r scripts can be accessed at https doi org 10 5066 p9vnzh7i haider et al 2021 as well as model predicted surfaces csss survey data are not available owing to restrictions on location data for endangered species contact enp for more information 3 results model convergence was achieved for both the frequentist and bayesian models the tjur s r2 for the frequentist model was 0 21 the auc was 0 633 sd 0 05 for the frequentist model 0 641 0 06 for the bayesian model and 0 637 0 05 for the ensemble model the rmse was 0 335 0 17 for the frequentist model 0 337 0 19 for the bayesian model and 0 335 0 18 for the ensemble model eversparrow produced estimates for the relationship between the probability of csss presence and each environmental covariate and their associated 95 confidence intervals frequentist model and credible intervals bayesian model fig 2 environmental covariates that crossed zero were days since dry days since dry squared maximum depth and maximum depth squared in the frequentist model and percent canopy cover squared in the bayesian model we created response curves for both frequentist and bayesian covariate estimates holding all other covariates equal to their mean values fig 3 overall csss response to the environmental covariates is weak as expected for a rare species and a data set with high zero inflation the frequentist and bayesian response curves show consistent trends probability of csss presence decreased with increasing maximum depth percent canopy cover percent woody vegetation easting and northing probabilities were highest for dry conditions maximum depth of 0 cm for grid cells where percent canopy cover was less than 10 and for grid cells where percent woody vegetation was less than 25 for increasing number of years post burn and percent burned probability of csss presence increased probability of csss presence was highest after six years post burn and for grid cells where more than 75 of the area was burned for hydroperiod csss probability of presence was highest between 80 and 120 days csss probability of presence had the strongest response to the covariates for hydroperiod easting and northing the frequentist model displayed larger uncertainty in the covariate estimates than the bayesian model particularly for high values of maximum depth and percent woody vegetation we created maps of predicted csss probability of presence for the frequentist bayesian and ensemble models for five dates that show different periods march july of the nesting season fig 4 across all dates the bayesian predictions show higher probabilities of presence than the frequentist predictions for all models csss probability of presence is lowest toward the end of the nesting season in july probability of csss presence is highest in the southern part of enp in subpopulation b with decreasing values in c d and e and lowest values in subpopulations a and f subpopulation b is the only area with values as high as the 71 80 range probabilities in subpopulations c d and e reach the 41 50 range in subpopulations a and f probabilities rarely exceed 20 for the last date probabilities greater than 20 are mostly restricted to subpopulation b across all predictions probabilities do not exceed 80 4 discussion eversparrow revealed the relationships between multiple hydrologic factors habitat and fire history and csss presence in and around csss subpopulations we found that csss probability of presence decreased with increasing values of maximum water depth indicating that suitability is highest during the breeding season when there is no inundation additionally csss probability of presence was highest when the hydroperiod was between 80 and 120 days which agrees with research from ross et al 2006 showing optimal conditions between 3 and 4 months this result provides support at the lower end of the u s fish and wildlife service target of 90 210 days usfws 2016 with declining probability of presence with hydroperiods of 120 210 days these hydrologic relationships reflect prior findings from the literature that high water levels during the breeding season can cause loss of sparrow nests baiser et al 2008 or indicate unsuitable vegetation types for csss populations nott et al 1998 in addition drier areas may experience too high fire frequencies for marl prairie habitat to support csss populations pearlstine et al 2016 walters et al 2000 while csss presence showed a strong response to hydroperiod the 95 covariate estimate for days since dry crossed 0 indicating that long scale hydrologic patterns in inundation hydroperiod is a 4 year mean of an annual variable while days since dry is a weekly variable have a stronger influence on csss site selection than real time conditions the relative strength of hydroperiod may also reflect the importance of site fidelity or vegetation type and could imply that more recent inundation events may not impact csss site selection and potentially endanger nest success vegetation community composition is closely linked to hydrology and fire whereby vegetation groups are aligned along hydrologic gradients based on hydroperiod davis et al 2005 sah et al 2015 the modeled csss response to percent canopy cover and percent woody vegetation confirms the literature on csss habitat preferences for non woody vegetation with probabilities of csss presence highest at 0 for both percent canopy cover and percent woody vegetation prior research has found that sparrows avoid woody vegetation nott et al 1998 ross et al 2006 in preference for primarily muhly grass dominated marl prairie habitat davis et al 2005 elderd and nott 2008 eversparrow output shows an increase in csss probability of presence six years post burn and above and for cells where 75 or more of the area was burned optimal conditions of 6 10 years post burn is mostly confirmed by previous research showing optimal intervals at 3 8 years after fire kushlan et al 1982 post and greenlaw 1994 or every 5 8 years benscoter et al 2019 a longer optimal fire interval may indicate inundation in marl prairie habitat too rapidly after fire occurrence impeding vegetation regrowth sah et al 2009 the easting and northing coordinates were included in the model to account for spatial dependence in the csss observations model outputs show decreasing probability of csss presence with increasing easting and northing coordinates indicating that probability of csss presence decreases in the northern and eastern parts of the model domain for the northing coordinates we see this higher suitability in the southern areas confirmed within subpopulation b which has the highest csss population estimate usfws 2020 for the easting covariate estimate grid cells in the easternmost areas are over sampled relative to the number of csss observations as compared to the westernmost areas of the study area this disproportionate sampling pattern results in the model predicting higher probability of presence in western grid cells employing both a frequentist and bayesian approach allowed us to build an ensemble model that uses inference from both frameworks while the auc is almost equal for both models different information is derived from each the frequentist confidence interval provides a uniform range in which there is a 95 certainty in the results versus the more informative bayesian credible interval in which a non uniform probability function is found within a 95 probability interval these two approaches result in some differences in the response curves such as the estimated relationships between csss presence and woody vegetation and csss presence and maximum water depth because the csss survey data are zero inflated the vague priors influence the parameter estimates banner et al 2020 resulting in a tighter credible interval from the bayesian model than the confidence interval for the frequentist model we expected that the ensemble model would weigh and reconcile differences of the spatial distributions of csss probabilities of presence resulting from the two modeling approaches in this case the two modeling approaches resulted in nearly identical spatial mapping though the bayesian model resulted in an improved range with somewhat higher probabilities in the core of subpopulation b and lower probabilities in the sloughs and western subpopulation a the largely similar results between the two modeling approaches are not necessarily surprising given that the bayesian model was directly analogous to the frequentist model and used weak or vague priors because the two modeling approaches provided similar results and the ensemble model did not provide increased performance we will exclusively use the bayesian model as eversparrow because of its higher auc value the posterior distributions that describe the relationship of csss presence to environmental predictors could be used in a future modeling effort as informative priors to strengthen our understanding of these relationships given additional data collection banner et al 2020 the csss survey data show population estimates in decreasing order with subpopulation b with the highest population estimate followed by e with subpopulations a c d and f having relatively low bird counts usfws 2020 maps showing eversparrow predicted probabilities are consistent with these survey data subpopulation b has the highest predicted probabilities and the highest number of recorded presences across all years the smallest predicted probabilities are in subpopulations a and f which since 2000 have had fewer than 25 and 5 recorded presences respectively in any individual year the predicted probability maps show similar values across subpopulations e c and d high predicted probability of presence values may indicate high quality habitat where sparrow populations are limited by dispersal or struggling to recover from prior severe population losses such as in subpopulation a after high water levels 1993 1996 nott et al 1998 in addition the prediction maps show high csss probability of presence in areas around the delineated subpopulations high probabilities occur along the enp main road between subpopulations e and b southwest of subpopulation d and east of taylor slough and along the eastern border of subpopulation b all areas outside of designated subpopulations but with higher probabilities than those found in subpopulations a or f this result highlights possible shifting hydrologic patterns in the everglades because of restoration and changing hydrologic management the density of scattered woody vegetation between some of the eastern subpopulations reduces the probabilities of csss presence but as hydrologic changes continue and restoration reduces woody vegetation suitable csss habitat may expand to these new locations eversparrow shows high probability of presence as early as march when csss surveys begin indicating a possible benefit to expanding csss survey dates into february while surveys are conducted march through june prior observations have indicated nesting may begin as early as february 15th van lent et al 1999 one of the major stressors to the marl prairie habitat and thus csss populations is prior water movement across the landscape including changes such as altered hydrologic patterns that result in shortened hydroperiods and increased drought severity in some areas but extended hydroperiods and drying pattern reversals in others davis et al 2005 these threats are reflected in csss habitat where subpopulations vary between too wet and too dry depending on historical hydrologic alteration and management operations sah et al 2019 our model quantifies the interdependent relationships between sparrow presence and hydrologic patterns and is applicable to water management actions to reduce threats and improve csss habitat suitability eversparrow is available online at jem gov modeling eversparrow as part of a suite of everglades restoration tools in the joint ecosystem modeling jem program a collaboration among restoration partners and led by usgs that supports planning and decision making in the greater everglades eversparrow is also run monthly as part of jem s everforecast application pearlstine et al 2020 where model output can be easily accessed and viewed for near term hydrologic forecasts at jem gov everforecast these user friendly platforms increase the utility of eversparrow as a decision support tool and can help natural resource managers adapt in real time to changing environmental conditions in support of csss recovery understanding the most important factors related to csss presence is critical to monitoring and attaining recovery objectives for the csss including maintaining and restoring functional csss habitat achieving demographic recovery criteria and achieving population numbers essential for recovery usfws 1999 usfws 2010 our modeling efforts help decipher the factors important to csss population recovery one recovery criterion is to sustain a minimum population of 6 600 for an average of five years but population estimates have not crossed this minimum threshold since 1981 usfws 2010 these numbers emphasize the importance of understanding the relationships between sparrow presence and environmental factors and how management and restoration actions affect csss populations many factors impede recovery and contribute to csss population declines and primary threats include changes in hydrologic management as captured in eversparrow and broader landscape issues that should be considered in future models or decision support tools including habitat loss from agricultural encroachment and urban development davis et al 2005 introduced predators e g pythons and tegus usfws 2020 climate change pearlstine et al 2009 usfws 2020 water quality degradation e g increased phosphorus from agricultural and urban sources naja et al 2017 and methylmercury contamination rumbold et al 2008 limitations to eversparrow begin with the survey data species prevalence impacts the performance and thus utility of species distribution models lawson et al 2014 manel et al 2001 threatened and rare species such as the csss have low prevalence often leading to zero inflated data sets and causing prediction maps and response curves to consistently predict low probabilities of presence while these low values may accurately reflect the rarity of the csss it makes suitable habitat difficult to differentiate from background this is reflected in our model performance metrics aucs for all three models hovered below 0 7 and the rmse values indicated 30 error in predicting species presence these results are attributable to the spatial cross validation procedure we used assessing performance without acknowledging the spatial structure present in the data would have produced overly optimistic performance results and more confidence in the models predictive power than warranted ploton et al 2020 roberts et al 2017 an additional limitation is that the csss survey data were not collected using a double observer method and so we were not able to account for detection of the species because of this our model parameter estimates are likely biased and confidence or credible intervals appear smaller than they likely are kéry and schmidt 2008 future work to improve csss modeling could include a more detailed integration of vegetation type and incorporation of microtopographic variation averaging hydrologic conditions across a 400 m grid provides us with only a coarse understanding of optimal conditions using new high resolution lidar imagery a vegetation classification could be used to improve model predictions instead of relying on environmental conditions as proxies for vegetation type new digital elevation models at extremely high resolutions 0 5 m are being completed and tested for enp based on 2017 2020 lidar 5 conclusions unoccupied niche and zero inflated data are challenges when modeling the sparse populations of the endangered csss our approach successfully provides a quantitative assessment of multiple environmental predictors to aid in understanding the factors affecting csss presence in the landscape our application of two logistic regressions to modeling the probability of csss presence resulted in close agreement between the models but with the bayesian approach demonstrating a slightly higher auc value the ensemble therefore did not provide improved confidence and we moved forward with just using the bayesian model as eversparrow the bayesian model offers the additional advantage of improved quantitative understanding of variable relation uncertainties and using the posterior distributions as informative priors for any future modeling efforts as the first approach to quantify the interdependent relationships between a range of environmental factors and csss presence this model expands the tools available to decision makers in the everglades to evaluate water management and restoration scenarios an advantage of the bayesian approach is that we can introduce probability distributions of any environmental predictor quantitatively or qualitatively derived to these unknown futures csss populations face significant impacts from everglades restoration changes to their marl prairie habitat eversparrow allows users to evaluate the spatial and temporal potential response of the csss to changes in hydrology fire and vegetation within and adjacent to the unique marl prairie community credit authorship contribution statement saira

study proposed a methodological framework of esv prediction for rapidly urbanization regions in this framework the esv equivalent markov chain system dynamic future land use simulation model were coupled and the drivers reflecting planning policies were integrated the framework was applied to the pearl river delta prd we found that the esv of prd would decrease marginally in five scenarios exhibiting an inverted u shaped of increasing northward along the pearl river estuary and there would be a noteworthy value loss area at the junction of foshan zhongshan under the scenarios of high

the spatiotemporal changes in the esv from 2000 to 2010 while kindu et al 2016 assessed the esv of the ethiopian highlands over the past 40 years and revealed that the reduction in forest land was the

future esv however few have focused on urban agglomerations what s worse it is scarce to incorporate the regional development directions into esv prediction urban agglomerations are typical rapidly urbanizing regions in developing countries cohen 2006 and the sprawling expansion of construction land has profoundly impacted the ecology of these areas liu et al 2016 this forces cities to explore new transformation and development directions traffic planning and innovation platforms are commonly employed in regional transformation and development planning and they can affect the urban lulc sun 2016 although some researchers have examined the impacts of planning policies on future urban development al ahmadi et al 2009 liang et al 2018 their effects on esv have rarely been explored this study aims to fill this gap by proposing an integrated esv assessment and prediction framework for highly urbanized regions by incorporating different planning drivers into lulc simulations in this framework the esv equivalent markov chain system dynamics and future land use simulation flus models are coupled and natural development farmland protection ecological protection high speed rail planning and innovation platform construction scenarios are designed to explore the impacts of different planning policies on future esv the proposed methods were applied to the pearl river delta prd the prd urban agglomeration is one of the most rapidly urbanizing regions in china as the population attraction of the prd to surrounding areas is still increasing determining the esv response to future lulc changes is crucial for land space planning the value of land ecosystem services in the spatiotemporal dimension is subject to the stage characteristics of economic development and spatial planning direction liang et al 2018 nowadays the prd has entered an era of high quality development driven by innovation song et al 2009 and the interconnection of high speed rail has become a new direction for lulc replacement zhang et al 2020 this study explores the esv responses in the prd to the lulc dynamics in the new stage since the urban agglomeration planning period in china is generally 15 years our research questions are as follow q1 what was the response of esv to lulc dynamics since 2000 q2 what are the spatiotemporal changes of esv under five scenarios in 2030 accordingly we propose two hypotheses h1 without considering external es flows the esv of the prd would decrease marginally with the expansion of construction land h2 under the guidance of high speed rail and innovation platform planning the esv of the prd would be more in line with the direction of sustainable development in the future 2 methodology in this paper we proposed the framework of esv assessment and prediction for highly urbanized regions the framework includes 1 esv equivalent establishment 2 scenario setting 3 lulc demand projection and 4 future esv simulation fig 1 four parts both the esv equivalent and multi scenario setting take the regional characteristics and urban transformation background into account 2 1 establishment of esv equivalent the assessment of esv is currently mainly influenced by costanza et al 1997 and xie et al 2008 in china in 1997 costanza et al 1997 published academic achievements in global esv opening the es assessment application based on a questionnaire survey of more than 200 ecological experts xie et al 2003 then revised costanza s esv to more accurately reflect the process of production consumption value in china the value calculation principle is as follows 1 e s v i 1 n v c i a i where esv is the total value of regional es v c i is the value coefficient of ecological services per unit area of land type i a i is the scale of land type i and n is the quantity of the lulc type owing to the difference in spatial scale v c i is not universal zang et al 2011 and the esv coefficients established by costanza and xie are not applicable to the study area therefore we used the improved value coefficient of the prd established by ye and dong 2010 table 1 based on the unit value of terrestrial ecosystem services in china xie et al 2008 the coefficients of different lulc were revised as paddy field is the main types of farmland in the prd and mature two to three times a year the value coefficient of farmland in the prd was adjusted to twice that of china while the esv of unit forest land and grassland is 1 45 times that of the country other land use coefficients remain unchanged 2 2 lulc demand projection different scenarios will affect the future lulc and esv of the prd according to the common scenarios ouyang et al al 2020 zhang et al al 2020 and the specific regional economic and lulc development characteristics we set up natural development sn farmland protection sf ecological protection se high speed rail planning sh and innovation platform construction si scenarios table 2 as the natural development scenario only needs to consider the laws of historical lulc we adopt markov chain to forecast the future lulc demand while other scenarios used system dynamic model 2 2 1 markov chain markov chain mc model is a special stochastic process arsanjani et al 2011 lu et al 2018 that can simulate the lulc scale li et al 1999 in the mc model the current state is only affected by the previous state hao et al 2015 in this study the demand for land at t 1 time depended on the land cover at t therefore the model is suitable for the lulc demand projection under natural development scenario the land development in the prd has become more intensive in the era of stock we abandoned the long time series of information and used two recent periods 2010 2015 of land cover data for simulation and the principle is as follows 2 s t 1 p i j s t where s t and s t 1 are the scales of different lulc types at t and t 1 and p i j is the transfer probability matrix of land cover types at different times 2 2 2 system dynamic system dynamics sd model can simulate the linear and non linear relationship between lulc demand and socioeconomic factors coyle 1997 in the model six land use types were classified as horizontal variables as the quantity of lulc is less affected by natural factors in the short term several socioeconomic factors were selected as auxiliary variables after reference delden et al 2010 shen et al 2009 you et al 2018 fig 2 according to the historical change law of auxiliary variables we determined the future lulc demand for the farmland protection ecological protection high speed rail planning and innovation platform construction scenarios by regulating the annual growth rate of the control variables table 3 2 3 future land use simulation model lulc simulation is the basis for future esv pattern predictions ca markov adhikari et al 2012 sang et al 2011 logistic ca markov l wu et al 2020 and clues lang et al 2019 peng et al 2020 xie et al 2021 are common simulation methods however they do not consider top down and bottom up interaction feedback within the model system which results in the dislocation between macro demand prediction and local land allocation liu et al 2017 the future land use simulation flus model couples an artificial neural network ann and cellular automata with a roulette selection mechanism and considers the impact of climate on lulc changes liang et al 2018 lin et al 2020 which compensates for the shortcomings of the abovementioned hybrid models liu et al 2017 given the high precision advantages of flus we used it to explore the future lulc pattern of the prd the model generally includes two main steps first we need to understand the spatial impact of different driving factors on lulc and train the adaptive probability of each cell using an ann the roulette selection mechanism is then used to realize the lulc demand spatialization by adjusting the land conversion matrix and weight of neighborhoods 2 3 1 adaptive probability estimation anns are a type of machine learning that can balance the complex relationship between input information and training objectives through multiple learning and iteration cui et al 2020 li and yeh 2002 they have been widely used in non linear geographic problem analysis openshaw 1998 and are also suitable for the multi objective training of future lulc simulations an ann generally includes an input hidden and output layer in the first part each neuron corresponds to an input variable such as socioeconomic or natural factors the mathematical principle is expressed as 3 x x 1 x 2 x n t where x i is the ith neuron in the input layer in the hidden layer the information received by neuron j from the input neurons on cell p at time t is estimated using the following equation 4 n e t j p t i w i j x i p t where n e t j p t is the information received by neuron j in the hidden layer x i p t is the ith variable related to neuron i on cell p at training time t and w i j is the adaptive weight between the input and hidden layers which is corrected in the training process the activation function can connect the hidden to the input layer while the sigmoid can effectively establish this association its principle can be expressed as 5 p p k t j w j k s i g m o i d n e t j p t j w j k 1 1 e n e t j p t where w j k is equivalent to the calibrated w i j which is an adaptive weight between the hidden and output layers the neural network model was established after training w i j and w j k and can estimate the adaptive probability each lulc type in a specific cell following the effective verification of lulc simulation in the historical period we integrated 12 spatial factors into ann training fig 4 among which the distance to the innovation platform is the specialization factor of the innovation platform construction scenario 2 3 2 spatialization of land demand in addition to the adaptive probability land demand spatialization is also affected by lulc conversion matrix and the neighborhood weight the roulette mechanism is the implementation path and its principles and settings are as followed conversion matrix the conversion matrix between different types of land is one of the bases for the differentiation of lulc spatial simulations the conversion rule of the natural development scenario was based on lulc changes characteristic since 2010 as high speed rail planning and innovation platform construction also require land development tendency we unified their conversion cost with natural development under the farmland and ecological protection scenario the conversion of the corresponding lulc types will be restricted considering the high demand and cost of prd land development we do not allow the developed land to be converted in the future and the conversion matrices are listed in table 4 weight of neighborhood the proportion of the scale of k type land and its neighborhood weight can determine the neighborhood development density ndd at a specific grid cell p the ndd for land use type k is defined as 6 ω p k t n n c o n c p t 1 k n n 1 w k where n n c o n c p t 1 k is the total number of grid cells occupied by k type land in the last iteration in the range of n n and w k is the weight of neighborhood representing the expansion ability of different lulc types ranging between 0 and 1 when the value is closer to 1 the land expansion capacity is stronger otherwise the opposite is true the expansion ability of lulc in different regional environments is unique therefore according to the characteristics of land expansion in the prd since 2000 we confirmed the neighborhood weights of farmland forest land grassland water construction land and unused land which were 0 1 0 1 0 3 0 1 1 0 and 0 1 respectively roulette selection by combining the calculated adaptive probability with the conversion matrix and neighborhood weight we obtained the comprehensive probability of land replacement using the following equation 7 t p p k t p p k ω p k t i n e r t i a k t 1 s c c k where t p p k t is the combined probability of converting the original land use of cell p into k type land at time t p p k is the probability of occurrence of k type land on cell p ω p k t denotes the neighborhood effect of land use type k on cell p at iteration time t i n e r t i a k t is the inertia coefficient of k type land at iteration time t s c c k is the conversion matrix from the land use type c to k we determined the land type occupying cell p by roulette selection based on the combination probability roulette selection considers the competitive relationship between different lulc types which improves the probability of non dominant land types being allocated under this method the possibility of land allocation is positively related to its comprehensive probability and lulc types with higher comprehensive probability are more likely to be occupied 3 study area and datasets 3 1 study area the prd is located in the south central region of guangdong province on the lower reaches of the pearl river and borders the south china sea 112 45 e 113 50 e 21 31 n 23 10 n the regional elevation is generally characterized as high in the north and low in the south the area contains a total of nine cities fig 3 covering an area of 55 000 km2 by the end of 2018 the gdp of the region reached cny9727 77 billion accounting for 83 3 of guangdong s gdp the permanent population was 63 1 million and the urbanization rate was 85 9 thus the area was in the later stage of urbanization since the economic reform and opening up the transfer of rural surplus labor rapid rise of township enterprises entry of foreign capital and import of foreign labor have promoted economic and land urbanization development in the prd however the scarcity of land and limitless demand has strained the relationship between the environment and humans which has led to a decrease in the regional es function in 2015 the issue of prd global spatial planning 2016 2020 highlighted the overall integration of all factors and space in the future and emphasized the reasonable arrangement of production living and ecological land to promote the level of comprehensive and coordinated regional development 3 2 data preparation the data set for the study includes lulc socioeconomic data driving factors and converted restricted layers and their attributes are detailed in table 5 3 2 1 lulc data the lulc data of the prd in 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 were obtained from the chinese academy of sciences data center for resources and environmental sciences with a resolution of 30 m the original data covers 22 land use subtypes for consistency with the lulc standard of esv we reclassed the original data into six categories farmland forest land grassland water construction and unused land according to the scale of the prd the lulc data within the area were divided into 100 100 m unit pixels with a total of 4146 3130 cells 3 2 2 socioeconomic data to predict future land demand we established an sd model of the relationship between the gdp population urbanization level grain output afforestation area and lulc the multi year 2000 2015 socioeconomic panel data were all obtained from the guangdong statistical information network 3 2 3 spatial driving and restricting factors the spatial driving factors required in this study included terrain and accessibility while the restricted layers contained water and ecological areas because the prd urban agglomeration belongs to the meso spatial scale we considered the impact of the regional infrastructure accessibility on lulc such as the distance to airport railway and national way based on the vector elements the spatial cells of accessibility were generated by euclidean distance analysis all the factor layers were resampled with the same accuracy as the lulc data notably when the value of the layers is lower the probability of land development is greater fig 4 4 results 4 1 dynamic processes of esv in response to historical lulc changes 4 1 1 historical lulc changes land use dynamic degree can reflect the changes of lulc in different period wang et al 1999 including individual and comprehensive land use dynamic degree the former is the average change of individual land in a certain period while the latter represents the comprehensive average change rate of all lands and their principles can be referred to tan et al 2020 since 2000 significant changes have occurred in the lulc structure of the prd and the comprehensive dynamic degree of lulc was 0 42 construction land expanded significantly grassland tended to be stable and the other land use types contracted overall the dynamic situation of land cover conversion in the corresponding period was investigated taking a time interval of five years the comprehensive lulc dynamic degrees of 2000 2005 2005 2010 and 2010 2015 were 0 71 0 34 and 0 25 respectively indicating that the response of different land use change rates was most intense during the first stage and then tended to become more moderate with clear temporal characteristics by 2015 the total scale of forest land accounted for the largest proportion followed by farmland and construction land from the perspective of individual lulc types fig 5 the dynamic degree of construction land was 5 35 and its scale in 2015 increased by 0 8 times from that in 2000 the expansion speed of construction land significantly decreased over time which was closely related to the transformation of planning in china over 15 years period the dynamic degrees of farmland and forest land were only 0 87 and 0 20 respectively because of their covered large areas in 2000 the total decreased scales of both were185 552 and 89 248 hm2 respectively secondly the reduction of water was also considerable with a decrease of 57 131 hm2 although the dynamic degree of unused land was high the scale of change was not clear due to its small benchmark scale as for grassland its dynamic degree declined over time and turned positive in 2010 2015 4 1 2 esv response the change in the regional lulc structure drove the fluctuation in the esv of the prd the economic value of es in the study area decreased from cny118 01 billion in 2000 to 110 94 billion in 2015 with a total loss of 7 07 billion forest land farmland and water were the main land types replaced by urban areas as these land types had a high esv per unit area was high their esv losses were almost equal to those of the regional esv from the perspective of es functions fig 6 the values of food production waste disposal and water conservation decreased the most reducing by 11 55 10 16 and 7 55 from that in 2000 respectively the functional order of the total economic losses was as follows waste disposal water conservation soil formation and conservation biodiversity conservation climate regulation entertainment and culture food production raw material supply the value reduction of the first two functions was cny3 20 billion which was much higher than those of the others in summary the rapid development of urbanization and industrialization in the prd has encroached on large areas of farmlands forests and water resulting in the shrinkage of regional natural space and a clear impact on esv 4 2 lulc simulation in this paper the sd model of lulc demand projection and the flus model of lulc spatial simulation were established only when the models were validated could they be credible thus we used relative error and kappa coefficient to verify respectively the former coefficient is the ratio between the difference of simulated and actual lulc demand to the actual scale when the error is less than 6 the high model reliability the latter expresses the agreement between two categorical datasets and its detailed principle can refer to cohen 1960 and van vliet et al 2011 generally kappa 75 indicates good consistency the closer kappa is to 1 the higher the accuracy the results showed that the relative error of the sd model from 2000 to 2015 was 0 59 while the kappa of the flus from 2010 to 2015 was 91 4 both models were effective and could be used to lulc and esv simulation 4 2 1 future lulc demand the total future lulc demand as projected by the sd and mc is shown in fig 7 under the farmland and ecological protection scenario the areas of farmland 1242 775 hm2 and forest land 2932 521 hm2 would be the largest respectively construction land demand is more prominent under the natural development high speed rail planning and innovation platform construction scenarios among these natural development will be the largest at 887 124 hm2 overall the future dynamic degree of the comprehensive lulc under the farmland protection scenario was lowest 0 10 followed by ecological protection 0 12 high speed rail planning and innovation platform construction 0 16 and natural development 0 22 4 2 2 future lulc distribution the future lulc spatial change of the prd was simulated by flus taking the predicted lulc demand as the baseline and combining the corresponding spatial factors and parameter rules the results showed that the spatial pattern of the regional lulc exhibits a certain distribution inertia in 2030 the expansion of construction land in cities along the pearl river estuary is the most prominent while the surrounding areas are still dominated by forest land and farmland fig 8 during the simulation period the construction land under natural development high speed rail planning and innovation platform construction scenarios would spread along developed land in 2015 while the farmland protection and ecological protection scenarios are relatively dispersed 4 3 spatiotemporal changes of esv in 2030 4 3 1 total esv forecast the esv of the prd in 2030 will be lower than that in 2015 however the rates of decline under the sub scenario differed during the simulation period the regional esv driven by historical land farmland protection ecological protection high speed rail planning and innovation platform construction are cny105 84 108 36 109 36 106 85 and 106 84 billion respectively under the ecological protection scenario the ecological benefits of lulc would be highest the impact on regional esv under the natural development scenario is the most notable decreasing by cny5 10 billion while the changes are relatively moderate under the high speed rail planning and innovation platform construction scenario additionally esv changes under the five scenarios have individual characteristics fig 9 the values of different service functions under the natural development high speed rail planning and innovation platform construction scenarios are below the esv of the base period which is mainly reflected in the weakening of water conservation and waste disposal capacity regarding farmland and ecological protection scenarios the function of gas regulation climate regulation soil formation and conservation and raw material supply would be enhanced however the ecological benefits of the latter are more prominent for farmland conversion constraints the farmland scale would be maintained under the corresponding scenario increasing the food production value by 0 37 under the ecological protection scenarios forest land will expand and its value will increase by 0 26 accordingly which can optimize regional biodiversity conservation 4 3 2 future pattern of esv in 2030 the spatial distribution of esv will be affected by the lulc of the prd forming an inverted u shaped pattern of increasing northward along the pearl river estuary compared with the simulated base period the main value growth space in 2030 will be scattered in the urban fringe with the inertial expansion of construction land the main areas with esv weakening in 2030 will be located around the zero value space in 2015 among them there is a clear value loss space in the extending inland areas from the east and west wings of the pearl river estuary particularly in the continuous zone between foshan and zhongshan the periphery of the entire region remains relatively stable the spatial variation in the esv under different scenarios exhibits local heterogeneity which reflects in two aspects one is the decreasing range of the esv along the zero value space of the base simulation period and the other is the number of patches with esv changes in the regional periphery with the extensive expansion of construction land and high frequency of land replacement on the periphery of the prd the spatial transformation in the esv under the natural development scenario will be the most notable fig 10 and 1029 121 cells would be changed the number of cells with reduced esv is 3 5 times greater than the number with increased unlike other scenarios the changing cell distribution is not limited to the south central region but occurs in the periphery areas fig 10 a1 c1 the scale of the esv change cell under the ecological protection scenario with 699 568 cells will be the smallest followed by the farmland protection scenario with 693 153 cells however they are still dominated by value reduction the spatial changes will mainly concentrate in cities that with higher gdp and more permanent residents fig 10 a2 c2 a3 c3 the esv changes under high speed rail planning and innovation platform construction scenarios are between those of natural development and dual protection with changes observed in approximately 810 000 cells under both scenarios fig 10 a4 c4 a5 c5 scattered land replacement would occur in marginal cities while the esv losses and increases can compete the total value of es in the periphery of the prd could remain stable global moran i could measure spatial autocorrelation according to the location and the values of the geographical feature huang 2021 thus we used this index to distinguish the distribution state of future esv the z scores 2 2 the z score of global moran s i is the standard deviation multiple of esv and the probability of spatial agglomeration generated by random is less than 1 when z 2 58 of the natural development farmland protection ecological protection high speed rail planning and innovation platform construction scenarios are 7 96 10 41 8 59 277 98 and 290 82 respectively compared to 2015 the esv agglomeration effect would severely decrease in the first three scenarios while the latter two would be enhanced since the global moran s i could not identify the exact distribution of agglomeration we adopted local moran s i index anselin 2010 and the results showed that with significant value changes in the cells the aggregation of esv under the natural development scenario would be the lowest reflecting the fragmentation tendency of the regional es function the spatial clustering patterns of the other scenarios will be similar in 2030 restricted by the eastward extension of high speed rail and the innovation platform construction of the guangzhou shenzhen science and technology corridor there would be a low low value cluster in the southwest of huizhou additionally the distribution pattern in the northwest and east of guangzhou would change exhibiting a high low value cluster pattern fig 11 5 discussion 5 1 spatiotemporal variation mechanism of esv land serves as the objective support for es tan et al 2020 fu et al 2014 and its demand is subject to the socioeconomic development of a specific region łuczak and just 2021 scholars have used markov dai et al 2021 shrestha et al 2020 and other models to predict future lulc demand ignoring the non linear effects of socioeconomic factors on lulc the sd model could explore the non linear relationship between lulc and the socioeconomic system through table function establishment spatially lulc competition is restricted by the interactions between spatial drivers the flus model considers both the top down and bottom up interactive feedback mechanisms of land systems which can better connect the overall lulc demand and local allocation liang et al 2018 liu et al 2017 therefore we integrated sd and flus to predict the future lulc demand and its spatial patterns in the prd urban agglomeration both models were verified which indicates that the correlation factors selected in this study are the drivers of the lulc changes in the study area construction land demand of prd is constrained by gdp population and urbanization the high ecological value of land types such as water forest land and farmland are influenced by the regional afforestation area investment in agriculture forestry animal husbandry and fishery as well as construction land expansion the spatial probability of land replacement and development is affected by the regional natural conditions dem slope and aspect and the accessibility of railway administrative centers and roads for maintaining the regional esv policymakers must rationalize overall and local land development by regulating the above drivers 5 2 planning implication es are related to human well being hwb pinto et al 2014 qiu et al 2021 which is consistent with sustainable development goals dasgupta et al 2019 in china relevant studies are needed for developing an ecological civilization with the release of the millennium ecosystem assessment assessment m e 2005 es research has presented multiple themes such as value assessment costanza et al 2014 xie et al 2017 supply demand relationship serna chavez et al 2014 trade off relationship deng et al 2016 as well as the coupling relationship between es and hwb li et al 2013 wangai et al 2017 among which esv assessment is the foundation the esv equivalent must be corrected for the prd due to regional differences in grain output and prices furthermore esv assessment is based on the recognition of the scarcity of es thus the prd s esv would marginally decrease from 2000 to 2030 with the expansion of construction land which confirmed hypothesis 1 but is contrary to liu et al 2019 it is urgent to balance the relationship between ecology and economic development to improve regional lulc sustainability in 2030 the esv varies under multi scenario simulation the value of the scenarios decreases in the following order ecological protection farmland protection high speed rail planning innovation platform construction and natural development the prd urban agglomeration is one of china s main areas of economic growth and its historic extensive land expansion is contrary to land planning transformation and ecological civilization construction as the esv prediction of the natural development scenario was based on historical lulc changes construction land will inertially expand and further impact the ecosystem which is inconsistent with the comprehensive development requirement under the ecological and farmland protection scenario the conversion constraints of forest land and farmland would improve gas regulation soil formation and protection services which can greatly maintain the esv of the prd however the gdp and urbanization growth rates under both scenarios would be lowest thus the actual need for economic development cannot be met the total esv of the high speed rail planning and innovation platform construction scenario is between the other scenarios and they can simultaneously achieve annual gdp urbanization and population growth of 12 2 5 and 0 6 respectively in comparison they better coordinate ecological and economic benefits to provide scientific references for regional planning and environmental management the future patterns of esv were visualized in this study from 2015 to 2030 the spatial distribution of the esv will be relatively stable forming an inverted u shaped pattern with a northward increase along the pearl river estuary forest land in the northern pearl river estuary has high regional esv which corresponds to the finding of hu et al 2019 however they overlooked the es function of the pearl river system consequently forest land and water must be taken as ecological sources and corridors respectively to build up ecological security pattern in the prd li et al 2019 the lulc structure in the south central region should be adjusted to meet the requirements of economic development we also identified the value change areas before and after simulation using map algebra to deepen the ideas of previous studies jiang et al 2016b hernández blanco et al 2020 over the next 15 years the areas with weakening esv will locate in the periphery of the zero value space in the simulation base period while areas with growth will mainly be distributed at the edge of the city there will be a noteworthy value loss area in the contiguous zone of foshan zhongshan limited by the developed lulc pattern there is little difference in the esv of the south central region under multi scenario simulation and the change in value in the periphery is the main difference properly expanding to meet the development requirements based on maintaining the esv of prd will be key to peripheral land use the high speed rail planning and innovation platform construction scenarios provides a better lulc mode and the cell numbers of the increased and decreased values in the periphery can approximately offset one another which meets the needs of reality besides both scenarios have stronger esv agglomeration which is consistent with hypothesis 2 5 3 limitations and future work our study adopted the value transfer method to preliminarily evaluate and predict the economic value of natural capital in the prd which provides a top down way for relevant studies but improvements must be needed in the future indeed the value cognition and games of multi agent are the subjective dimension that affect the valuation of es costanza et al 2017b due to the differences of individual information and perception as well as the complexity of games we can t solve this problem well additionally we embed the non linear impact of socioeconomic on lulc into es assessment but haven t explored the non linear relationship between lulc and esv owing to the diverse sources of es we should combine the service flow to examine the es threshold and functional bottom line of the prd from an open and dynamic perspective in view of the availability of data the population and economy factors only acted as quantitative indicators for land demand and esv prediction thus we could optimize the study by night lighting data application since the lack of basic farmland protection distribution data we adopted the quantity of farmland and existing area to simulate the farmland protection scenario therefore spatial accuracy must be further improved when forecasting future lulc demand by sd model the time lag effect of auxiliary variables on lulc was ignored the variable time relationship should be analyzed in the future 6 conclusion currently spatiotemporal studies on future esv in rapidly urbanizing areas based on the urban agglomeration scale are lacking similar studies at other scales in china have ignored the impacts of economic growth and regional planning policies this study integrated the scale effects of the esv equivalent with the influences of innovation and high speed rail network planning on esv based on the understanding of historical esv dynamics we explored the future spatiotemporal changes of esv in the prd urban agglomeration under multiple scenarios it was confirmed that the esv of the prd would marginally decrease with the expansion of construction land while the spatial pattern of esv is stable exhibiting an inverted u shaped pattern of increasing northward along the pearl river estuary and there would be a noteworthy value loss area in the junction of foshan zhongshan guided by the high speed rail and innovation platform planning the changes of esv would be moderate than other scenarios and distribute more clustered which is more conducive to the sustainable development of the prd but attention must be paid to the low values cluster in the southwest of huizhou northwest and east of guangzhou funding this study was supported by the national natural science foundation of china 41 771 096

24534,land use and land cover lulc changes significantly affect regional ecosystem services value esv exploring the changes of esv is helpful for lulc structure adjustment and space optimization this study proposed a methodological framework of esv prediction for rapidly urbanization regions in this framework the esv equivalent markov chain system dynamic future land use simulation model were coupled and the drivers reflecting planning policies were integrated the framework was applied to the pearl river delta prd we found that the esv of prd would decrease marginally in five scenarios exhibiting an inverted u shaped of increasing northward along the pearl river estuary and there would be a noteworthy value loss area at the junction of foshan zhongshan under the scenarios of high speed rail and innovation platform planning the lulc patterns could better balance the relationship of economic development and esv reduction and the agglomeration effects of esv would be strengthened simultaneously which is more conducive for the ecological security pattern construction future development of the region could refer to the lulc patterns of these two scenarios but attention must be

empirical findings provide valuable insight for spatial and ecological planning in highly urbanized areas in developing countries graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords land use simulation ecosystem service value high speed rail planning innovation platform pearl river delta 1 introduction ecosystem services es refer to products and services that people directly or indirectly obtain from the ecosystem daily et al 2000 li et al 2011 costanza 2018 r costanza et al 2017 including provisioning regulating supporting and cultural services assessment m e 2005 the rapid urbanization of developing countries in recent decades has impacted es while promoting economic development xie et al 2017 yang et al 2021 manifesting in negative ecological effects at different spatiotemporal scales grimm et al 2008 kalnay and cai 2003 such as the impact of forest reduction on global climate and local biodiversity the obstruction of construction land expansion to water infiltration and so on global urbanization is still advancing and the urban population will reach 68 by 2050 parween 2019 hence investigating the changes of future es is essential for spatial planning and environmental policy formulation in rapidly urbanizing areas gómez baggethun and barton 2013 land use land cover lulc is the primary driver that affects es tan et al 2020 while physical quantity and economic value are important dimensions for understanding the response of es to lulc changes c jiang et al 2016 ferrier et al 2016 fu and zhang 2014 based on expert knowledge researchers have established methods for global costanza et al 1997 2014 srikanta et al 2018 and local carrilho et al 2018 xie et al 2017 ecosystem service value esv assessment to quantify es considering the increasingly strained relationship between humanity and the environment the impact of lulc on esv has become a research topic of great interest in recent years karki et al 2018 many studies have explored the effect of lulc dynamics on esv changes in developing countries li et al 2021 and have revealed the essential role of lulc in the ecological environment for example jing et al 2021 reported that urban sprawl water area forest and cultivated land were sensitive factors for esv changes in the nansi lake basin china while talukdar et al 2020 analyzed the response of the esv to changes in lulc in the lower gangetic plain of india and highlighted the positive ecological effects of water and vegetated areas arowolo et al 2018 took nigeria as an empirical example and explored the spatiotemporal changes in the esv from 2000 to 2010 while kindu et al 2016 assessed the esv of the ethiopian highlands over the past 40 years and revealed that the reduction in forest land was the main reason for the sharp decline in the esv although these findings provide basic insights for ecological environment management they lack foresight on the effects of future lulc dynamics on esv patterns other recent studies have elucidated the implications of future lulc changes for esv akhtar et al 2020 aziz 2021 some researchers have used the markov chain to project future lulc demand and esv according to the historical trend of land use changes in different regions such as the upper blue nile basin gashaw et al 2018 and chengdu dai et al 2021 for exploring the esv future patterns spatialization esv studies based on lulc simulations have emerged gao et al 2021 and akhtar et al 2020 applied the ca markov model to simulate the lulc distribution and esv pattern in shijiazhuang china and lahore pakistan in 2030 respectively while other scholars used the clues model xie et al 2021 c y wu et al 2020 lang et al 2019 in these studies scenario settings were usually limited to natural development ecological protection and farmland protection estoque et al 2012 gao et al 2021 gashaw et al 2018 lang et al 2019 li et al 2020 woldeyohannes et al 2020 and they ignored the linear and non linear relationships between lulc demand and socioeconomic factors two recent studies conducted by shrestha et al 2020 and akhtar et al 2020 considered the impact of economic development on future esv however few have focused on urban agglomerations what s worse it is scarce to incorporate the regional development directions into esv prediction urban agglomerations are typical rapidly urbanizing regions in developing countries cohen 2006 and the sprawling expansion of construction land has profoundly impacted the ecology of these areas liu et al 2016 this forces cities to explore new transformation and development directions traffic planning and innovation platforms are commonly employed in regional transformation and development planning and they can affect the urban lulc sun 2016 although some researchers have examined the impacts of planning policies on future urban development al ahmadi et al 2009 liang et al 2018 their effects on esv have rarely been explored this study aims to fill this gap by proposing an integrated esv assessment and prediction framework for highly urbanized regions by incorporating different planning drivers into lulc simulations in this framework the esv equivalent markov chain system dynamics and future land use simulation flus models are coupled and natural development farmland protection ecological protection high speed rail planning and innovation platform construction scenarios are designed to explore the impacts of different planning policies on future esv the proposed methods were applied to the pearl river delta prd the prd urban agglomeration is one of the most rapidly urbanizing regions in china as the population attraction of the prd to surrounding areas is still increasing determining the esv response to future lulc changes is crucial for land space planning the value of land ecosystem services in the spatiotemporal dimension is subject to the stage characteristics of economic development and spatial planning direction liang et al 2018 nowadays the prd has entered an era of high quality development driven by innovation song et al 2009 and the interconnection of high speed rail has become a new direction for lulc replacement zhang et al 2020 this study explores the esv responses in the prd to the lulc dynamics in the new stage since the urban agglomeration planning period in china is generally 15 years our research questions are as follow q1 what was the response of esv to lulc dynamics since 2000 q2 what are the spatiotemporal changes of esv under five scenarios in 2030 accordingly we propose two hypotheses h1 without considering external es flows the esv of the prd would decrease marginally with the expansion of construction land h2 under the guidance of high speed rail and innovation platform planning the esv of the prd would be more in line with the direction of sustainable development in the future 2 methodology in this paper we proposed the framework of esv assessment and prediction for highly urbanized regions the framework includes 1 esv equivalent establishment 2 scenario setting 3 lulc demand projection and 4 future esv simulation fig 1 four parts both the esv equivalent and multi scenario setting take the regional characteristics and urban transformation background into account 2 1 establishment of esv equivalent the assessment of esv is currently mainly influenced by costanza et al 1997 and xie et al 2008 in china in 1997 costanza et al 1997 published academic achievements in global esv opening the es assessment application based on a questionnaire survey of more than 200 ecological experts xie et al 2003 then revised costanza s esv to more accurately reflect the process of production consumption value in china the value calculation principle is as follows 1 e s v i 1 n v c i a i where esv is the total value of regional es v c i is the value coefficient of ecological services per unit area of land type i a i is the scale of land type i and n is the quantity of the lulc type owing to the difference in spatial scale v c i is not universal zang et al 2011 and the esv coefficients established by costanza and xie are not applicable to the study area therefore we used the improved value coefficient of the prd established by ye and dong 2010 table 1 based on the unit value of terrestrial ecosystem services in china xie et al 2008 the coefficients of different lulc were revised as paddy field is the main types of farmland in the prd and mature two to three times a year the value coefficient of farmland in the prd was adjusted to twice that of china while the esv of unit forest land and grassland is 1 45 times that of the country other land use coefficients remain unchanged 2 2 lulc demand projection different scenarios will affect the future lulc and esv of the prd according to the common scenarios ouyang et al al 2020 zhang et al al 2020 and the specific regional economic and lulc development characteristics we set up natural development sn farmland protection sf ecological protection se high speed rail planning sh and innovation platform construction si scenarios table 2 as the natural development scenario only needs to consider the laws of historical lulc we adopt markov chain to forecast the future lulc demand while other scenarios used system dynamic model 2 2 1 markov chain markov chain mc model is a special stochastic process arsanjani et al 2011 lu et al 2018 that can simulate the lulc scale li et al 1999 in the mc model the current state is only affected by the previous state hao et al 2015 in this study the demand for land at t 1 time depended on the land cover at t therefore the model is suitable for the lulc demand projection under natural development scenario the land development in the prd has become more intensive in the era of stock we abandoned the long time series of information and used two recent periods 2010 2015 of land cover data for simulation and the principle is as follows 2 s t 1 p i j s t where s t and s t 1 are the scales of different lulc types at t and t 1 and p i j is the transfer probability matrix of land cover types at different times 2 2 2 system dynamic system dynamics sd model can simulate the linear and non linear relationship between lulc demand and socioeconomic factors coyle 1997 in the model six land use types were classified as horizontal variables as the quantity of lulc is less affected by natural factors in the short term several socioeconomic factors were selected as auxiliary variables after reference delden et al 2010 shen et al 2009 you et al 2018 fig 2 according to the historical change law of auxiliary variables we determined the future lulc demand for the farmland protection ecological protection high speed rail planning and innovation platform construction scenarios by regulating the annual growth rate of the control variables table 3 2 3 future land use simulation model lulc simulation is the basis for future esv pattern predictions ca markov adhikari et al 2012 sang et al 2011 logistic ca markov l wu et al 2020 and clues lang et al 2019 peng et al 2020 xie et al 2021 are common simulation methods however they do not consider top down and bottom up interaction feedback within the model system which results in the dislocation between macro demand prediction and local land allocation liu et al 2017 the future land use simulation flus model couples an artificial neural network ann and cellular automata with a roulette selection mechanism and considers the impact of climate on lulc changes liang et al 2018 lin et al 2020 which compensates for the shortcomings of the abovementioned hybrid models liu et al 2017 given the high precision advantages of flus we used it to explore the future lulc pattern of the prd the model generally includes two main steps first we need to understand the spatial impact of different driving factors on lulc and train the adaptive probability of each cell using an ann the roulette selection mechanism is then used to realize the lulc demand spatialization by adjusting the land conversion matrix and weight of neighborhoods 2 3 1 adaptive probability estimation anns are a type of machine learning that can balance the complex relationship between input information and training objectives through multiple learning and iteration cui et al 2020 li and yeh 2002 they have been widely used in non linear geographic problem analysis openshaw 1998 and are also suitable for the multi objective training of future lulc simulations an ann generally includes an input hidden and output layer in the first part each neuron corresponds to an input variable such as socioeconomic or natural factors the mathematical principle is expressed as 3 x x 1 x 2 x n t where x i is the ith neuron in the input layer in the hidden layer the information received by neuron j from the input neurons on cell p at time t is estimated using the following equation 4 n e t j p t i w i j x i p t where n e t j p t is the information received by neuron j in the hidden layer x i p t is the ith variable related to neuron i on cell p at training time t and w i j is the adaptive weight between the input and hidden layers which is corrected in the training process the activation function can connect the hidden to the input layer while the sigmoid can effectively establish this association its principle can be expressed as 5 p p k t j w j k s i g m o i d n e t j p t j w j k 1 1 e n e t j p t where w j k is equivalent to the calibrated w i j which is an adaptive weight between the hidden and output layers the neural network model was established after training w i j and w j k and can estimate the adaptive probability each lulc type in a specific cell following the effective verification of lulc simulation in the historical period we integrated 12 spatial factors into ann training fig 4 among which the distance to the innovation platform is the specialization factor of the innovation platform construction scenario 2 3 2 spatialization of land demand in addition to the adaptive probability land demand spatialization is also affected by lulc conversion matrix and the neighborhood weight the roulette mechanism is the implementation path and its principles and settings are as followed conversion matrix the conversion matrix between different types of land is one of the bases for the differentiation of lulc spatial simulations the conversion rule of the natural development scenario was based on lulc changes characteristic since 2010 as high speed rail planning and innovation platform construction also require land development tendency we unified their conversion cost with natural development under the farmland and ecological protection scenario the conversion of the corresponding lulc types will be restricted considering the high demand and cost of prd land development we do not allow the developed land to be converted in the future and the conversion matrices are listed in table 4 weight of neighborhood the proportion of the scale of k type land and its neighborhood weight can determine the neighborhood development density ndd at a specific grid cell p the ndd for land use type k is defined as 6 ω p k t n n c o n c p t 1 k n n 1 w k where n n c o n c p t 1 k is the total number of grid cells occupied by k type land in the last iteration in the range of n n and w k is the weight of neighborhood representing the expansion ability of different lulc types ranging between 0 and 1 when the value is closer to 1 the land expansion capacity is stronger otherwise the opposite is true the expansion ability of lulc in different regional environments is unique therefore according to the characteristics of land expansion in the prd since 2000 we confirmed the neighborhood weights of farmland forest land grassland water construction land and unused land which were 0 1 0 1 0 3 0 1 1 0 and 0 1 respectively roulette selection by combining the calculated adaptive probability with the conversion matrix and neighborhood weight we obtained the comprehensive probability of land replacement using the following equation 7 t p p k t p p k ω p k t i n e r t i a k t 1 s c c k where t p p k t is the combined probability of converting the original land use of cell p into k type land at time t p p k is the probability of occurrence of k type land on cell p ω p k t denotes the neighborhood effect of land use type k on cell p at iteration time t i n e r t i a k t is the inertia coefficient of k type land at iteration time t s c c k is the conversion matrix from the land use type c to k we determined the land type occupying cell p by roulette selection based on the combination probability roulette selection considers the competitive relationship between different lulc types which improves the probability of non dominant land types being allocated under this method the possibility of land allocation is positively related to its comprehensive probability and lulc types with higher comprehensive probability are more likely to be occupied 3 study area and datasets 3 1 study area the prd is located in the south central region of guangdong province on the lower reaches of the pearl river and borders the south china sea 112 45 e 113 50 e 21 31 n 23 10 n the regional elevation is generally characterized as high in the north and low in the south the area contains a total of nine cities fig 3 covering an area of 55 000 km2 by the end of 2018 the gdp of the region reached cny9727 77 billion accounting for 83 3 of guangdong s gdp the permanent population was 63 1 million and the urbanization rate was 85 9 thus the area was in the later stage of urbanization since the economic reform and opening up the transfer of rural surplus labor rapid rise of township enterprises entry of foreign capital and import of foreign labor have promoted economic and land urbanization development in the prd however the scarcity of land and limitless demand has strained the relationship between the environment and humans which has led to a decrease in the regional es function in 2015 the issue of prd global spatial planning 2016 2020 highlighted the overall integration of all factors and space in the future and emphasized the reasonable arrangement of production living and ecological land to promote the level of comprehensive and coordinated regional development 3 2 data preparation the data set for the study includes lulc socioeconomic data driving factors and converted restricted layers and their attributes are detailed in table 5 3 2 1 lulc data the lulc data of the prd in 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 were obtained from the chinese academy of sciences data center for resources and environmental sciences with a resolution of 30 m the original data covers 22 land use subtypes for consistency with the lulc standard of esv we reclassed the original data into six categories farmland forest land grassland water construction and unused land according to the scale of the prd the lulc data within the area were divided into 100 100 m unit pixels with a total of 4146 3130 cells 3 2 2 socioeconomic data to predict future land demand we established an sd model of the relationship between the gdp population urbanization level grain output afforestation area and lulc the multi year 2000 2015 socioeconomic panel data were all obtained from the guangdong statistical information network 3 2 3 spatial driving and restricting factors the spatial driving factors required in this study included terrain and accessibility while the restricted layers contained water and ecological areas because the prd urban agglomeration belongs to the meso spatial scale we considered the impact of the regional infrastructure accessibility on lulc such as the distance to airport railway and national way based on the vector elements the spatial cells of accessibility were generated by euclidean distance analysis all the factor layers were resampled with the same accuracy as the lulc data notably when the value of the layers is lower the probability of land development is greater fig 4 4 results 4 1 dynamic processes of esv in response to historical lulc changes 4 1 1 historical lulc changes land use dynamic degree can reflect the changes of lulc in different period wang et al 1999 including individual and comprehensive land use dynamic degree the former is the average change of individual land in a certain period while the latter represents the comprehensive average change rate of all lands and their principles can be referred to tan et al 2020 since 2000 significant changes have occurred in the lulc structure of the prd and the comprehensive dynamic degree of lulc was 0 42 construction land expanded significantly grassland tended to be stable and the other land use types contracted overall the dynamic situation of land cover conversion in the corresponding period was investigated taking a time interval of five years the comprehensive lulc dynamic degrees of 2000 2005 2005 2010 and 2010 2015 were 0 71 0 34 and 0 25 respectively indicating that the response of different land use change rates was most intense during the first stage and then tended to become more moderate with clear temporal characteristics by 2015 the total scale of forest land accounted for the largest proportion followed by farmland and construction land from the perspective of individual lulc types fig 5 the dynamic degree of construction land was 5 35 and its scale in 2015 increased by 0 8 times from that in 2000 the expansion speed of construction land significantly decreased over time which was closely related to the transformation of planning in china over 15 years period the dynamic degrees of farmland and forest land were only 0 87 and 0 20 respectively because of their covered large areas in 2000 the total decreased scales of both were185 552 and 89 248 hm2 respectively secondly the reduction of water was also considerable with a decrease of 57 131 hm2 although the dynamic degree of unused land was high the scale of change was not clear due to its small benchmark scale as for grassland its dynamic degree declined over time and turned positive in 2010 2015 4 1 2 esv response the change in the regional lulc structure drove the fluctuation in the esv of the prd the economic value of es in the study area decreased from cny118 01 billion in 2000 to 110 94 billion in 2015 with a total loss of 7 07 billion forest land farmland and water were the main land types replaced by urban areas as these land types had a high esv per unit area was high their esv losses were almost equal to those of the regional esv from the perspective of es functions fig 6 the values of food production waste disposal and water conservation decreased the most reducing by 11 55 10 16 and 7 55 from that in 2000 respectively the functional order of the total economic losses was as follows waste disposal water conservation soil formation and conservation biodiversity conservation climate regulation entertainment and culture food production raw material supply the value reduction of the first two functions was cny3 20 billion which was much higher than those of the others in summary the rapid development of urbanization and industrialization in the prd has encroached on large areas of farmlands forests and water resulting in the shrinkage of regional natural space and a clear impact on esv 4 2 lulc simulation in this paper the sd model of lulc demand projection and the flus model of lulc spatial simulation were established only when the models were validated could they be credible thus we used relative error and kappa coefficient to verify respectively the former coefficient is the ratio between the difference of simulated and actual lulc demand to the actual scale when the error is less than 6 the high model reliability the latter expresses the agreement between two categorical datasets and its detailed principle can refer to cohen 1960 and van vliet et al 2011 generally kappa 75 indicates good consistency the closer kappa is to 1 the higher the accuracy the results showed that the relative error of the sd model from 2000 to 2015 was 0 59 while the kappa of the flus from 2010 to 2015 was 91 4 both models were effective and could be used to lulc and esv simulation 4 2 1 future lulc demand the total future lulc demand as projected by the sd and mc is shown in fig 7 under the farmland and ecological protection scenario the areas of farmland 1242 775 hm2 and forest land 2932 521 hm2 would be the largest respectively construction land demand is more prominent under the natural development high speed rail planning and innovation platform construction scenarios among these natural development will be the largest at 887 124 hm2 overall the future dynamic degree of the comprehensive lulc under the farmland protection scenario was lowest 0 10 followed by ecological protection 0 12 high speed rail planning and innovation platform construction 0 16 and natural development 0 22 4 2 2 future lulc distribution the future lulc spatial change of the prd was simulated by flus taking the predicted lulc demand as the baseline and combining the corresponding spatial factors and parameter rules the results showed that the spatial pattern of the regional lulc exhibits a certain distribution inertia in 2030 the expansion of construction land in cities along the pearl river estuary is the most prominent while the surrounding areas are still dominated by forest land and farmland fig 8 during the simulation period the construction land under natural development high speed rail planning and innovation platform construction scenarios would spread along developed land in 2015 while the farmland protection and ecological protection scenarios are relatively dispersed 4 3 spatiotemporal changes of esv in 2030 4 3 1 total esv forecast the esv of the prd in 2030 will be lower than that in 2015 however the rates of decline under the sub scenario differed during the simulation period the regional esv driven by historical land farmland protection ecological protection high speed rail planning and innovation platform construction are cny105 84 108 36 109 36 106 85 and 106 84 billion respectively under the ecological protection scenario the ecological benefits of lulc would be highest the impact on regional esv under the natural development scenario is the most notable decreasing by cny5 10 billion while the changes are relatively moderate under the high speed rail planning and innovation platform construction scenario additionally esv changes under the five scenarios have individual characteristics fig 9 the values of different service functions under the natural development high speed rail planning and innovation platform construction scenarios are below the esv of the base period which is mainly reflected in the weakening of water conservation and waste disposal capacity regarding farmland and ecological protection scenarios the function of gas regulation climate regulation soil formation and conservation and raw material supply would be enhanced however the ecological benefits of the latter are more prominent for farmland conversion constraints the farmland scale would be maintained under the corresponding scenario increasing the food production value by 0 37 under the ecological protection scenarios forest land will expand and its value will increase by 0 26 accordingly which can optimize regional biodiversity conservation 4 3 2 future pattern of esv in 2030 the spatial distribution of esv will be affected by the lulc of the prd forming an inverted u shaped pattern of increasing northward along the pearl river estuary compared with the simulated base period the main value growth space in 2030 will be scattered in the urban fringe with the inertial expansion of construction land the main areas with esv weakening in 2030 will be located around the zero value space in 2015 among them there is a clear value loss space in the extending inland areas from the east and west wings of the pearl river estuary particularly in the continuous zone between foshan and zhongshan the periphery of the entire region remains relatively stable the spatial variation in the esv under different scenarios exhibits local heterogeneity which reflects in two aspects one is the decreasing range of the esv along the zero value space of the base simulation period and the other is the number of patches with esv changes in the regional periphery with the extensive expansion of construction land and high frequency of land replacement on the periphery of the prd the spatial transformation in the esv under the natural development scenario will be the most notable fig 10 and 1029 121 cells would be changed the number of cells with reduced esv is 3 5 times greater than the number with increased unlike other scenarios the changing cell distribution is not limited to the south central region but occurs in the periphery areas fig 10 a1 c1 the scale of the esv change cell under the ecological protection scenario with 699 568 cells will be the smallest followed by the farmland protection scenario with 693 153 cells however they are still dominated by value reduction the spatial changes will mainly concentrate in cities that with higher gdp and more permanent residents fig 10 a2 c2 a3 c3 the esv changes under high speed rail planning and innovation platform construction scenarios are between those of natural development and dual protection with changes observed in approximately 810 000 cells under both scenarios fig 10 a4 c4 a5 c5 scattered land replacement would occur in marginal cities while the esv losses and increases can compete the total value of es in the periphery of the prd could remain stable global moran i could measure spatial autocorrelation according to the location and the values of the geographical feature huang 2021 thus we used this index to distinguish the distribution state of future esv the z scores 2 2 the z score of global moran s i is the standard deviation multiple of esv and the probability of spatial agglomeration generated by random is less than 1 when z 2 58 of the natural development farmland protection ecological protection high speed rail planning and innovation platform construction scenarios are 7 96 10 41 8 59 277 98 and 290 82 respectively compared to 2015 the esv agglomeration effect would severely decrease in the first three scenarios while the latter two would be enhanced since the global moran s i could not identify the exact distribution of agglomeration we adopted local moran s i index anselin 2010 and the results showed that with significant value changes in the cells the aggregation of esv under the natural development scenario would be the lowest reflecting the fragmentation tendency of the regional es function the spatial clustering patterns of the other scenarios will be similar in 2030 restricted by the eastward extension of high speed rail and the innovation platform construction of the guangzhou shenzhen science and technology corridor there would be a low low value cluster in the southwest of huizhou additionally the distribution pattern in the northwest and east of guangzhou would change exhibiting a high low value cluster pattern fig 11 5 discussion 5 1 spatiotemporal variation mechanism of esv land serves as the objective support for es tan et al 2020 fu et al 2014 and its demand is subject to the socioeconomic development of a specific region łuczak and just 2021 scholars have used markov dai et al 2021 shrestha et al 2020 and other models to predict future lulc demand ignoring the non linear effects of socioeconomic factors on lulc the sd model could explore the non linear relationship between lulc and the socioeconomic system through table function establishment spatially lulc competition is restricted by the interactions between spatial drivers the flus model considers both the top down and bottom up interactive feedback mechanisms of land systems which can better connect the overall lulc demand and local allocation liang et al 2018 liu et al 2017 therefore we integrated sd and flus to predict the future lulc demand and its spatial patterns in the prd urban agglomeration both models were verified which indicates that the correlation factors selected in this study are the drivers of the lulc changes in the study area construction land demand of prd is constrained by gdp population and urbanization the high ecological value of land types such as water forest land and farmland are influenced by the regional afforestation area investment in agriculture forestry animal husbandry and fishery as well as construction land expansion the spatial probability of land replacement and development is affected by the regional natural conditions dem slope and aspect and the accessibility of railway administrative centers and roads for maintaining the regional esv policymakers must rationalize overall and local land development by regulating the above drivers 5 2 planning implication es are related to human well being hwb pinto et al 2014 qiu et al 2021 which is consistent with sustainable development goals dasgupta et al 2019 in china relevant studies are needed for developing an ecological civilization with the release of the millennium ecosystem assessment assessment m e 2005 es research has presented multiple themes such as value assessment costanza et al 2014 xie et al 2017 supply demand relationship serna chavez et al 2014 trade off relationship deng et al 2016 as well as the coupling relationship between es and hwb li et al 2013 wangai et al 2017 among which esv assessment is the foundation the esv equivalent must be corrected for the prd due to regional differences in grain output and prices furthermore esv assessment is based on the recognition of the scarcity of es thus the prd s esv would marginally decrease from 2000 to 2030 with the expansion of construction land which confirmed hypothesis 1 but is contrary to liu et al 2019 it is urgent to balance the relationship between ecology and economic development to improve regional lulc sustainability in 2030 the esv varies under multi scenario simulation the value of the scenarios decreases in the following order ecological protection farmland protection high speed rail planning innovation platform construction and natural development the prd urban agglomeration is one of china s main areas of economic growth and its historic extensive land expansion is contrary to land planning transformation and ecological civilization construction as the esv prediction of the natural development scenario was based on historical lulc changes construction land will inertially expand and further impact the ecosystem which is inconsistent with the comprehensive development requirement under the ecological and farmland protection scenario the conversion constraints of forest land and farmland would improve gas regulation soil formation and protection services which can greatly maintain the esv of the prd however the gdp and urbanization growth rates under both scenarios would be lowest thus the actual need for economic development cannot be met the total esv of the high speed rail planning and innovation platform construction scenario is between the other scenarios and they can simultaneously achieve annual gdp urbanization and population growth of 12 2 5 and 0 6 respectively in comparison they better coordinate ecological and economic benefits to provide scientific references for regional planning and environmental management the future patterns of esv were visualized in this study from 2015 to 2030 the spatial distribution of the esv will be relatively stable forming an inverted u shaped pattern with a northward increase along the pearl river estuary forest land in the northern pearl river estuary has high regional esv which corresponds to the finding of hu et al 2019 however they overlooked the es function of the pearl river system consequently forest land and water must be taken as ecological sources and corridors respectively to build up ecological security pattern in the prd li et al 2019 the lulc structure in the south central region should be adjusted to meet the requirements of economic development we also identified the value change areas before and after simulation using map algebra to deepen the ideas of previous studies jiang et al 2016b hernández blanco et al 2020 over the next 15 years the areas with weakening esv will locate in the periphery of the zero value space in the simulation base period while areas with growth will mainly be distributed at the edge of the city there will be a noteworthy value loss area in the contiguous zone of foshan zhongshan limited by the developed lulc pattern there is little difference in the esv of the south central region under multi scenario simulation and the change in value in the periphery is the main difference properly expanding to meet the development requirements based on maintaining the esv of prd will be key to peripheral land use the high speed rail planning and innovation platform construction scenarios provides a better lulc mode and the cell numbers of the increased and decreased values in the periphery can approximately offset one another which meets the needs of reality besides both scenarios have stronger esv agglomeration which is consistent with hypothesis 2 5 3 limitations and future work our study adopted the value transfer method to preliminarily evaluate and predict the economic value of natural capital in the prd which provides a top down way for relevant studies but improvements must be needed in the future indeed the value cognition and games of multi agent are the subjective dimension that affect the valuation of es costanza et al 2017b due to the differences of individual information and perception as well as the complexity of games we can t solve this problem well additionally we embed the non linear impact of socioeconomic on lulc into es assessment but haven t explored the non linear relationship between lulc and esv owing to the diverse sources of es we should combine the service flow to examine the es threshold and functional bottom line of the prd from an open and dynamic perspective in view of the availability of data the population and economy factors only acted as quantitative indicators for land demand and esv prediction thus we could optimize the study by night lighting data application since the lack of basic farmland protection distribution data we adopted the quantity of farmland and existing area to simulate the farmland protection scenario therefore spatial accuracy must be further improved when forecasting future lulc demand by sd model the time lag effect of auxiliary variables on lulc was ignored the variable time relationship should be analyzed in the future 6 conclusion currently spatiotemporal studies on future esv in rapidly urbanizing areas based on the urban agglomeration scale are lacking similar studies at other scales in china have ignored the impacts of economic growth and regional planning policies this study integrated the scale effects of the esv equivalent with the influences of innovation and high speed rail network planning on esv based on the understanding of historical esv dynamics we explored the future spatiotemporal changes of esv in the prd urban agglomeration under multiple scenarios it was confirmed that the esv of the prd would marginally decrease with the expansion of construction land while the spatial pattern of esv is stable exhibiting an inverted u shaped pattern of increasing northward along the pearl river estuary and there would be a noteworthy value loss area in the junction of foshan zhongshan guided by the high speed rail and innovation platform planning the changes of esv would be moderate than other scenarios and distribute more clustered which is more conducive to the sustainable development of the prd but attention must be paid to the low values cluster in the southwest of huizhou northwest and east of guangzhou funding this study was supported by the national natural science foundation of china 41 771 096
