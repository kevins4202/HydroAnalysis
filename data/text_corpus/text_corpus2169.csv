10845,although deficit irrigation has long been recognized as a water saving practice the beneficial effects on crop production and on water use efficiency under varying atmospheric evaporative demands has rarely been examined in the present study the coordinated effects of soil moisture and atmospheric vapor pressure deficit vpd on photosynthetic carbon gain versus water transport and water use efficiency in tomato were addressed experiments were designed with factorial combinations of two levels of vpd and two gradients of soil moisture low vpd vpd 1 0 kpa compensated for the negative effect of soil water deficit on plant photosynthesis and productivity by reducing the resistance for co2 transport moreover low vpd moderated water stress by reducing the force driving passive water movement and preventing turgor loss which sustained stomatal openness and reduced the resistance to co2 uptake in addition to stomatal conductance the mesophyll conductance for co2 transport from the substomatal cavities to the chloroplasts was increased synchronously in low vpd grown plants the effect of water use efficiency on the yields and plant biomass was substantially increased in the low vpd treatment for both deficit irrigation and well irrigated conditions water use efficiency was maximized in the combinatory treatment of deficit irrigation and low vpd the present study demonstrated that the beneficial effect of deficit irrigation on tomato was amplified by decreasing vpd to the range of 0 5 1 kpa by decreasing the resistance for co2 uptake from the atmosphere to the carboxylation site moreover the adverse effects of deficit irrigation were pronounced with increased vpd when exceeding 1 kpa therefore vpd plays significant roles in mediating the magnitudes of the beneficial or negative effects of deficit irrigation the present study highlights the significance of the integrative regulation of soil and atmospheric moisture conditions which provides novel insight for water saving tomato production keywords deficit irrigation vapor pressure deficit stomatal conductance mesophyll conductance water use efficiency 1 introduction soil moisture or irrigation regimes are important factors affecting plant water status photosynthesis plant productivity and water use efficiency in agricultural production systems the soil plant atmosphere continuum constitutes the source path sink sequence of water movement the driving force for water movement is determined by the distribution of free energy along the source path sink sequence fricke 2017 sack and holbrook 2006 wheeler and stroock 2008 in addition to the source of soil moisture the atmospheric water sink is also an important factor which affects passive water transport and pulls water out of the soil soil moisture is relatively stable over the diurnal period during which it varies much less than the high oscillation of typical evaporative demand caldeira et al 2014 especially in greenhouse systems under short term stable soil moisture conditions water movement and plant water status are further determined by atmospheric vpd optimal ranges of water flow rate can be achieved by the regulation of atmospheric vpd as this parameter is largely related to plant physiological processes shamshiri et al 2016b in general the optimal range recommended in different studies is from 0 3 kpa to 1 0 kpa barker 1990 iraqi et al 1995 niu et al 2015 peet and welles 2005 vpd beyond 1 kpa is considered potentially stressful vpd between 1 5 2 kpa is known to reduce stomatal conductance for horticultural crops even when the ambient temperature is mild shamshiri et al 2018 plant water deficit occurs frequently under high vpd conditions even when the root is well irrigated semi closed greenhouses increase in temperature promptly after sunrise and vpd easily exceeds the optimal range greenhouse vpd can be as high as 3 5 kpa in the spring and summer seasons zhang et al 2015 the adverse effects of vpd that exceeds 1 5 kpa is even commonly observed during the winter season when it mostly occurs around midday lu et al 2015 high vpd inside greenhouses is a significant factor contributing to the plant water deficit photosynthetic limitation yield loss and excessive transpiration zhang et al 2017 2018a 2018b the increasing sophisticated mechanical devices such as pad fan systems and fogging systems are widely applied in greenhouse cultivation ohyama et al 2008 toida et al 2006 the combination of computer systems and fogging systems facilitates precise and automatic vpd regulation shamshiri et al 2016a soil moisture and atmospheric vpd are extensively reported as the most significant environmental factors driving water movement and affecting photosynthesis and water use efficiency it has been demonstrated that plants reduce transpiration to maintain physiological water balance in response to low soil water availability which triggers photosynthetic limitations a moderate water deficit can improve water use efficiency by reducing water consumption without significant yield loss bell et al 2018 lo bianco and francaviglia 2012 growing evidence suggests that high vpd increase the passive driving force and trigger plant water deficit which constrains plant photosynthesis and productivity attempts to identify the coordinated effects of soil moisture and atmospheric vpd on photosynthetic carbon gain versus water movement are less abundant in the literature the coordinated effects of soil moisture and vpd on stomatal behavior mesophyll conductance and photosynthesis have been reported in several species perez martin et al 2009 smith 1989 xue et al 2004 however the coordinated effects of soil moisture and vpd on water use efficiency incorporating the trade off between photosynthetic carbon gain versus water movement are rarely reported in the present study the coordinated effect of soil moisture and atmospheric vpd on tomato solanum lycopersicum l cv shengluolan water use efficiency is highlighted by coupling the processes of photosynthetic carbon gain and water movement the source of soil moisture and the sink of atmospheric vpd are hypothesized to be closely coupled in determining the driving force of passive water movement photosynthesis and hence water use efficiency three questions were addressed 1 is the effect of soil moisture on photosynthetic co2 uptake plant growth and productivity influenced by vpd 2 is the effect of soil moisture on the force driving water movement water movement and cumulative water consumption influenced by vpd 3 is the effect of soil moisture on the trade off between plant carbon gain and cumulative water consumption influenced by vpd 2 material and methods 2 1 plant materials and growth conditions the experiment was carried out in two climate controlled phytotrons 3 5 m in length 2 3 m in width and 1 9 m in height and greenhouses 5 m in length 4 m in width and 3 m in height at shandong agriculture university from february to august 2018 tomato seeds were sown in plugs for germination and transplanted at the four leaf stage into plastic pots approximately five weeks after sowing which were uniformly filled with a mixed substrate containing an organic substrate and perlite mixture 3 1 the main properties of the substrate were as follows bulk density 0 32 g cm 3 porosity 58 7 ph 6 8 available nitrogen 2012 mg kg 1 available phosphorus 898 mg kg 1 and available potassium 2896 mg kg 1 there was no fertilizer applied during the experiments side shoots were removed and all plants were uniformly trimmed at the internode above the fourth inflorescence four fruits of similar size were retained on each inflorescence the experiment was designed with two factors and used a 2ⅹ2 factorial approach two levels of vpd and soil moisture vpd levels were achieved via phytotrons and through greenhouse environmental regulation in the phytotron experiments vpd was controlled at two contrasting levels a high vpd treatment with a range of 2 5 3 kpa 0 5 kpa day night and a low vpd treatment with a range of 0 5 1 kpa 0 5 kpa day night the contrasting vpd levels in the phytotron experiments were achieved solely by regulating relative humidity while the other environmental factors were uniformly controlled at the following normal levels a temperature of 30 20 c day night photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd of 500 μmol m 2 s 1 with a photoperiod of 14 h and a co2 concentration of 400 μmol mol 1 in the greenhouse experiments with natural light conditions contrasting vpd gradients were achieved by a misting system as described in detail in a previous study zhang et al 2018a briefly high vpd was achieved in the greenhouse with natural conditions low vpd was achieved by misting systems which were automatically activated when vpd exceeded 1 2 kpa and continuously operated until the vpd fell below the targeted level two moisture regimes were imposed for each vpd level in both the phytotron and the greenhouses experiments well irrigated conditions with soil moisture at 90 95 of field capacity and moderate deficit irrigation with soil moisture at 55 60 of field capacity therefore four treatments were established high vpd well irrigated conditions high vpd deficit irrigation low vpd well irrigated conditions and low vpd deficit irrigation the soil surface of the potted plants was covered with film to prevent soil evaporation daily and cumulative transpiration was determined by a standardized gravimetric approach zhang et al 2017 the gravimetric approach for transpiration measurement and the maintenance of the target soil moisture was described in detail previously zhang et al 2018a briefly the target soil moisture was maintained by supplemental irrigation according to the daily amount of water lost through transpiration irrigation was obtained from groundwater sources which was mainly pore phreatic water the main properties of the irrigation water were as follows k 8 78 μg ml 1 na 115 μg ml 1 ca2 26 12 μg ml 1 and mg2 40 23 μg ml 1 2 2 determination of plant water status the air water potential was calculated according to fricke 2017 1 ψ a i r r t v m ln p w v p w v where r is the general gas constant 8 314 j k 1 mol 1 t is the absolute temperature in kelvin vm is the partial molal volume of water and pwv and pwv are

dark conditions for 8 10 h for the estimation of soil water potential ψsoil as previously described tsuda and tyree 2000 ψsoil remained relatively constant and can be assumed to equal leaf water potential under dark conditions since the water movement was approximately zero plant water status was determined on healthy and fully expanded leaves approximately 40 days after transplanting leaf

aluminum foil and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen osmotic potential ψπ of the leaf sap was assessed using a thermocouple psychrometer chamber wescor inc logan ut usa coupled to a data logger psypro wescor inc after equilibrium as described in a previous study rodriguez dominguez et al 2016 turgor potential ψp was calculated as the difference between leaf water potential and osmotic potential ψp ψleaf ψπ locke and ort 2014 the relative water content rwc was measured simultaneously with the determination of leaf water potential as fresh weight dry weight turgid weight dry weight the protocol for measuring fresh weight dry weight and turgid weight was described in detail previously zhang et al 2017 the whole plant hydraulic conductance kplant was determined by the evaporative flux method according to ohm s law zhang et al 2018a which was described as kplant tplant ψsoil ψleaf the plant transpiration rate tplant was measured from the weight of the water loss from plants at approximately hourly intervals as described by previous research tsuda and tyree 2000 2 3 diffusion conductance for photosynthetic co2 uptake and transport photosynthetic measurement was performed simultaneously with the measurement of plant water status using the terminal leaflets of intact attached leaves by photosynthesis systems li 6400 li cor inc lincoln ne usa during the measurements environmental parameters in the leaf chamber were set close to the open field conditions in the phytotrons the leaf temperature was set to 30 1 c the light intensity was 1000 μmol m 2s 1 the co2 concentration was 400 μmol 5 mol 1 and the vpd was set to 1 0 kpa and 2 5 kpa for low and high vpd grown plants respectively the diffusion conductance for photosynthetic co2 uptake and transport was estimated according to fick s first law of diffusion by measuring gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence simultaneously an electronic circuit model for photosynthetic co2 uptake and transport through a source path sink continuum is shown in fig 1 stomatal resistance and mesophyll resistance were coupled by a series circuit with the driving force of the co2 partial pressure gradient stomatal conductance for co2 uptake gsc can be estimated according to water diffusion conductance gsw and the molecular diffusivities of water and co2 in gas giuliani et al 2013 mesophyll conductance gm which represents the conductance for co2 transport from the substomatal cavities to the carboxylation sites within chloroplasts was calculated according to the variable j method harley et al 1992 2 g m p n c i c c where pn is the net photosynthesis rate ci is the substomatal co2 concentration and cc is the chloroplastic co2 concentration pn and ci were measured by steady state gas exchange cc was estimated by combining gas exchange and chlorophyll 3 c c γ j 8 p n r d j 4 p n r d where j is the electron transport rate rd is the rate of mitochondrial respiration in the light and γ is the chloroplastic co2 compensation point r d and γ were estimated according to laisk and oja 1998 pn ci curves were performed at two irradiance levels 75 and 500 μmol m 2 s 1 at co2 concentrations ranging from 30 to 120 μmol co2 mol 1 air the intersection point of the pn ci curves was used to estimate γ x axis and rd y axis the electron transport rate j was calculated as 4 j φ psii ppfd α β where φpsii

studies genty et al 1989 α is leaf absorption of photosynthetic quanta and β reflects the fraction of photons absorbed by photosystem ii ppfd is photosynthetically active photon flux density as stomatal and mesophyll resistance are coupled in a series circuit the total diffusion resistance 1 gtot for co2 transport can be calculated as 1 gtot 1 gsc 1 gm niinemets et al 2009 therefore gtot can be determined as follows 5 g t o t 1 1 g s c 1 g m the photosynthetic limitation is portioned into stomatal limitation mesophyll limitation and biochemical limitation the fraction of diffusion limitations including stomatal ls and mesophyll resistance lm imposed on photosynthesis was analyzed according to the quantitative method muir et al 2014 6 l s g t o t g s a c c g t o t a c c l m g t

intercellular co2 concentration ci was calculated under combinations of varying soil moisture and atmospheric vpd following the procedures of a previous study zhang et al 2018a briefly a pn ci curve was constructed by adjusting the ambient co2 concentration ca from 400 to 300 200 150 100 and 50 μmol mol 1 and then increasing to 400 μmol mol 1 after regaining a steady state at 400 μmol mol 1 ca was elevated gradually from 400 μmol mol 1 to 1500 μmol mol 1 carboxylation efficiency ce was determined according to a linear regression of the curve of pn versus ci with ca 200 μmol mol 1 as described in sun et al 2016 the maximum rate of rubisco carboxylation capacity vcmax and the maximal rate of electron transport jmax were calculated by the fvcb model farquhar et al 1980 and the modification long and bernacchi 2003 respectively 2 5 water use efficiency water use efficiency wue was calculated as the shoot dry biomass and fresh fruit yield per consumed unit of water defined as wue plant and wue yield respectively kadam et al 2015 reina sánchez et al 2005 2 6 statistical analysis two way analysis of variance anova was performed to test the effects of soil moisture and vpd on physiological parameters the data were compared using the duncan test data analyses were performed using the spss software version 19 0 graphics were created using origin version 8 0 3 results 3 1 coordinated effect of soil moisture and vpd on the energetic and the driving force for water movement both soil moisture and vpd affected the distribution of water potential along the soil plant atmosphere continuum as illustrated in fig 2 high vpd contributed to an excessive negative air water potential ψair the water potential gradient between the leaf and the atmosphere was far larger than the water potential gradient at the soil leaf boundary due to the excessive negative atmospheric water potential consequently the water potential drawdown was largest at the leaf air boundary along the soil plant atmosphere continuum for all the treatments this passive driving force was substantially decreased by reducing the vpd but to a lesser extent was determined by the soil water status fig 2 ψleaf was made less negative by decreasing vpd regardless of the soil water status the δψleaf air was reduced by approximately 36 in the low vpd treatment 3 2 coordinated effect of soil moisture and vpd on plant water status plant water stress was moderated by decreasing vpd for both deficit irrigation and well irrigated conditions according to the plant water relations illustrated in fig 3 no significant difference was found in osmotic potential ψπ among treatments fig 3a leaf turgor potential ψp tended to be higher in the low vpd treatments regardless of the soil moisture level fig 3b leaf relative water content rwc was highest in the combination of well irrigated conditions and low vpd and no significant differences were observed among the other treatments fig 3c the pattern of plant hydraulic conductance kplant was similar to that of leaf turgor potential which was improved by decreasing vpd fig 3d 3 3 coordinated effect of soil moisture and vpd on photosynthetic capacity the photosynthetic rate increased with elevated co2 concentration and reached a plateau in a similar pattern regardless of soil moisture and atmospheric vpd fig 4 however maximal steady state photosynthesis rates were higher in the low vpd treatment than in the high vpd treatment regardless of the deficit irrigated fig 4a or well irrigated plants fig 4b carboxylation efficiency ce maximum carboxylation rate vcmax and maximum electron transport rate jmax tended to be higher in low vpd treatment than in high vpd treatment for both deficit and well irrigated plants fig 5 ce vcmax and jmax were maximized in the combination of low vpd and well irrigated conditions deficit irrigation combined with high vpd caused the greatest photosynthetic limitation with the minimum values of ce vcmax and jmax 3 4 coordinated effect of soil moisture and vpd on diffusion conductance for photosynthetic co2 uptake and transport similar to the photosynthetic parameters the diffusion conductance for photosynthetic co2 uptake and transport was increased by different extents in the low vpd treatment regardless of soil moisture fig 6 the increases were more pronounced in deficit irrigation when compared with well irrigated conditions stomatal conductance was increased by 54 7 and 26 3 for deficit irrigation and well irrigated conditions respectively and mesophyll conductance was increased by 80 7 and 14 3 for deficit irrigation and well irrigated conditions respectively consequently the fractional constraints of the stomatal mesophyll and total diffusion limitations on photosynthesis under deficit irrigation were significantly reduced by decreasing vpd fig 7 however the contribution of the diffusion limitation imposed on photosynthesis was not significantly affected by vpd regulation under well irrigated conditions 3 5 coordination between soil moisture and vpd in regulating plant growth and productivity plant biomass production was reduced to some extent by deficit irrigation and this negative effect was offset by decreasing the vpd the dry biomass of leaf stem fruit shoot and fresh fruit yield was greatest in the combination of full irrigation and low vpd treatment fig 8 the shoot dry biomass was increased by 21 9 and 18 9 in the low vpd treatment for the deficit irrigated and well irrigated plants respectively the fresh fruit yield was increased by 35 8 and 14 6 in the low vpd treatment for the deficit and well irrigated plants respectively in the greenhouse experiments plant biomass and yield were also improved in the low vpd treatment regardless of soil water status plant biomass and fresh fruit yield were maximized in the combination of low vpd and well irrigated conditions supplementary table 1 3 6 coordination between soil moisture and vpd in regulating plant transpiration and wue deficit irrigation coupled with low vpd achieved the minimum transpiration among the combinations and no significant differences were observed among the other treatments fig 9 a plant water consumption was reduced by 24 by decreasing the excessive vpd in the deficit treatments in combination with plant productivity water use efficiency was maximized in the combination of deficit irrigation and low vpd treatments as demonstrated by fresh fruit yield wueyield and shoot dry biomass wueplant fig 9b and c the wueyield increased substantially by 60 1 and 16 3 by decreasing the excessive vpd for deficit irrigation and well irrigated conditions respectively the wueplant was increased substantially by 56 1 and 21 3 by decreasing the excessive vpd for deficit irrigation and well irrigated conditions respectively in the greenhouse experiments the cumulative water consumption was reduced in the low vpd treatment regardless of soil water status and was minimized in the combination of low vpd and deficit irrigation supplementary table 1 both wueplant and wueyield were significantly increased in the low vpd treatment regardless of soil water status and were maximized in the combination of low vpd and deficit irrigation supplementary table 1 4 discussion the present study demonstrated that the effect of soil moisture on water transport photosynthesis and water use efficiency in tomato is influenced by atmospheric vpd in contrast to the beneficial effects of deficit irrigation demonstrated in a previous study lu et al 2019 deficit irrigation coupled with high vpd significantly constrained photosynthesis and plant growth and therefore substantially decreased water use efficiency the photosynthetic limitation and productivity loss of deficit irrigation was efficiently moderated by decreasing vpd consequently deficit irrigation combined with low vpd achieved the maximum water use efficiency vpd regulation offsets the negative effect of deficit irrigation and maximizes water use efficiency as a result of three key processes 1 low vpd moderated plant water stress and compensated for stomatal limitation by mediating the energetic force driving water transport 2 within the mesophyll low vpd moderated the limitation of co2 transport from the substomatal cavity to the carboxylation site in chloroplasts by modifying leaf structures 3 deficit irrigation combined with low vpd maximized water use efficiency by reconciling the photosynthetic improvement and the transpired water savings a potential schematic model for the process by which low vpd moderated photosynthetic limitation by reducing the co2 diffusion resistance of the stomata and mesophyll is illustrated in fig 10 4 1 vpd regulation sustained stomatal openness and reduced stomatal resistance by reducing the excessive force driving water movement and moderating plant water stress stomata are the first gatekeepers for leaf photosynthetic co2 uptake and impose a great resistance stomatal openness responds to the turgor of guard cells surrounding pores lawson and blatt 2014 the turgor of the guard cells is primarily regulated by passive hydraulic mechanisms and plant water status stomatal closure occurs to prevent excessive transpiration water loss under water stress conditions stomatal closure is passively regulated by the reduced leaf water content and turgor under an excessive atmospheric evaporative demand buckley 2016 merilo et al 2018 vialet chabrand et al 2017 although stomatal closure plays a significant role in maintaining water balance the stomatal resistance for photosynthetic co2 uptake increases simultaneously with changes in leaf water content soil water stress is extensively reported as the foremost factor triggering a plant water deficit and stomatal closures christmann et al 2007 the atmospheric evaporative demand was addressed in the present study since the force driving passive water movement was greatest at the leaf air boundary along the soil plant atmosphere continuum regardless of soil moisture content the water flow rate was enlarged under high vpd according to the penman monteith equation and previous experimental evidence zhang et al 2017 in contrast to the instantaneous transpiration rate there was no significant difference in cumulative transpiration over the whole growth period between the low and high vpd treatments under well irrigated conditions cumulative water consumption is the integral of transpiration rate over leaf area and growing seasons leaf area is also an important factor determining long term plant water consumption high vpd inhibited plant growth and reduced leaf area zhang et al 2015 despite the increased transpiration rate due to high vpd the cumulative plant water consumption was potentially offset by reduced leaf area plant water status was determined by vpd to a greater extent than soil moisture in the present study no significant difference was found in ψπ among treatments which may be attributed to the osmotic adjustment in the accumulation of k na soluble sugar proline and so on vpd mediation of the force driving passive water movement was the foremost factor triggering plant water deficit plant water stress occurred even under well irrigated conditions due to the excessive force driving passive water movement the excessive force driving passive water movement and plant water stress were more pronounced with increasing vpd in the present study therefore the negative effect of deficit irrigation on water stress was aggravated under high vpd consequently stomatal resistance and the photosynthetic depression increased with soil water stress and high vpd reducing the excessive vpd efficiently maintained water balance and moderated plant water stress by decreasing the force driving passive water movement the negative effect of deficit irrigation on plant water stress was reduced when coupled with low vpd the hydraulic limitation for water movement was efficiently moderated by decreasing vpd which facilitated favorable plant water status and sustained stomatal function for photosynthetic co2 uptake fig 10 4 2 vpd regulation moderated mesophyll limitation for co2 transport from substomatal cavity to carboxylation site within chloroplasts via modifying leaf structure in contrast to previous research which attributed photosynthetic limitation to stomatal closure under varying soil moisture and vpd perez martin et al 2009 smith 1989 mesophyll resistance accounted for a large fraction of the photosynthetic limitation in the present study it was recognized that mesophyll resistance for co2 transport from the substomatal cavity to the carboxylation site within chloroplasts also significantly constrained plant photosynthesis especially for c3 plants flexas et al 2012 kaldenhoff 2012 li et al 2019 niinemets et al 2009 von caemmerer and evans 2010 in contrast to the rapid sensitive response of stomatal conductance to the external environmental variation mesophyll conductance remained relatively stable and was determined by leaf structural parameters to a large extent han et al 2018 muir et al 2014 terashima et al 2011 leaf structural traits determined the maximum diffusion conductance leaf mass area lma is a good indicator of some underlying traits such as the thickness of the lamina cell wall and mesophyll generally higher lma is associated with a thicker leaf which indicates greater drought tolerance john et al 2017 in the present study low vpd significantly reduced lma for both deficit irrigation and well irrigated conditions indicating little investment per leaf area and looser leaf structure supplementary fig 1 lma was negatively correlated with mesophyll conductance fig 11 which was consistent with previous research muir et al 2014 the negative correlation between lma and mesophyll conductance was mediated by the thickness of the lamina and tissue density a higher lma and thicker lamina or tissue in response to deficit irrigation and high vpd prevented water loss and improved drought tolerance which simultaneously increased the resistance for co2 diffusion leaf structural acclimation to long term low vpd contributed to the increase in mesophyll conductance lma was significantly decreased in low vpd grown plants which suggested a thinner and looser leaf structure the relatively loose leaf structure reduced diffusion resistance and facilitated rapid co2 transport to the chloroplast stroma within the leaf fig 10 4 3 deficit irrigation combined with low vpd maximized water use efficiency by moderating photosynthetic limitation and reducing transpiration all components of diffusion resistance were summed together total conductance was increased substantially the reduced stomatal and mesophyll resistance facilitated sufficient co2 at the sink for carbon assimilation which was the mechanistic basis for the substantial improvement in photosynthetic capacity and plant growth the extent to which the stomatal and mesophyll limitations constrained photosynthesis was significantly reduced by decreasing vpd for both well and deficit irrigation the fresh fruit yield under well irrigation in the present study approximated the commercial greenhouse tomato production lu et al 2015 the present study provided evidence that the effect of soil moisture on plant water status photosynthetic performance and water use efficiency is influenced by vpd the decreased vpd moderated photosynthetic limitation without an increase in water consumption thereby increased the beneficial effect of deficit irrigation the adverse effect of deficit irrigation was more pronounced with increasing vpd with dramatic photosynthetic limitations and a decline in water use efficiency the degree of soil water stress should be weakened when deficit irrigation is applied in arid climates with excessive atmospheric evaporative demand therefore the integrative regulation of soil and atmospheric moisture is necessary to optimize the trade off between photosynthetic carbon gain and water transport and water consumption 5 conclusions the effect of soil moisture on water movement photosynthetic co2 utilization and water use efficiency is influenced by atmospheric vpd the force driving passive water movement was efficiently reduced by decreasing vpd regardless of soil moisture low vpd decreased the diffusion resistance for co2 transport which moderated the photosynthetic limitation without increasing water consumption and therefore increased the beneficial effect of deficit irrigation the adverse effects of deficit irrigation were more pronounced under high vpd than under low vpd with a dramatic photosynthetic depression and a decline in water use efficiency water use efficiency was maximized in the combination of low vpd and deficit irrigation acknowledgement this project was supported by the natural science foundation of shandong

cm 3 porosity 58 7 ph 6 8 available nitrogen 2012 mg kg 1 available phosphorus 898 mg kg 1 and available potassium 2896 mg kg 1 there was no fertilizer applied during the experiments side shoots were removed and all plants were uniformly trimmed at the internode above the fourth inflorescence four fruits of similar size were retained on each inflorescence the experiment was designed with two factors and used a 2ⅹ2 factorial approach two levels of vpd and soil moisture vpd levels were achieved via phytotrons and through greenhouse environmental regulation in the phytotron experiments vpd was controlled at two contrasting levels a high vpd treatment with a range of 2 5 3 kpa 0 5 kpa day night and a low vpd treatment with a range of 0 5 1 kpa 0 5 kpa day night the contrasting vpd levels in the phytotron experiments were achieved solely by regulating relative humidity while the other environmental factors were uniformly controlled at the following normal levels a temperature of 30 20 c day night photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd of 500 μmol m 2 s 1 with a photoperiod of 14 h and a co2 concentration of 400 μmol mol 1 in the greenhouse experiments with natural light conditions contrasting vpd gradients were achieved by a misting system as described in detail in a previous study zhang et al 2018a briefly high vpd was achieved in the greenhouse with natural conditions low vpd was achieved by misting systems which were automatically activated when vpd exceeded 1 2 kpa and continuously operated until the vpd fell below the targeted level two moisture regimes were imposed for each vpd level in both the phytotron and the greenhouses experiments well irrigated conditions with soil moisture at 90 95 of field capacity and moderate deficit irrigation with soil moisture at 55 60 of field capacity therefore four treatments were established high vpd well irrigated conditions high vpd deficit irrigation low vpd well irrigated conditions and low vpd deficit irrigation the soil surface of the potted plants was covered with film to prevent soil evaporation daily and cumulative transpiration was determined by a standardized gravimetric approach zhang et al 2017 the gravimetric approach for transpiration measurement and the maintenance of the target soil moisture was described in detail previously zhang et al 2018a briefly the target soil moisture was maintained by supplemental irrigation according to the daily amount of water lost through transpiration irrigation was obtained from groundwater sources which was mainly pore phreatic water the main properties of the irrigation water were as follows k 8 78 μg ml 1 na 115 μg ml 1 ca2 26 12 μg ml 1 and mg2 40 23 μg ml 1 2 2 determination of plant water status the air water potential was calculated according to

aluminum foil and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen osmotic potential ψπ of the leaf sap was assessed using a thermocouple psychrometer chamber wescor inc logan ut usa coupled to a data logger psypro wescor inc after equilibrium as described in a previous study rodriguez dominguez et al 2016 turgor potential ψp was calculated as the difference between leaf water potential and osmotic potential ψp ψleaf ψπ locke and ort 2014 the relative water content rwc was measured simultaneously with the determination of leaf water potential as fresh weight dry weight turgid weight dry weight the protocol for measuring fresh weight dry weight and turgid weight was described in detail previously zhang et al 2017 the whole plant hydraulic conductance kplant was determined by the evaporative flux method according to ohm s law zhang et al 2018a which was described as kplant tplant ψsoil ψleaf the plant transpiration rate tplant was measured from the weight of the water loss from plants at approximately hourly intervals as described by previous research tsuda and tyree 2000 2 3 diffusion conductance for photosynthetic co2 uptake and transport photosynthetic measurement was performed simultaneously with the measurement of plant water status using the terminal leaflets of intact attached leaves by photosynthesis systems li 6400 li cor inc lincoln ne usa during the measurements environmental parameters in the leaf chamber were set close to the open field conditions in the phytotrons the leaf temperature was set to 30 1 c the light intensity was 1000 μmol m 2s 1 the co2 concentration was 400 μmol 5 mol 1 and the vpd was set to 1 0 kpa and 2 5 kpa for low and high vpd grown plants respectively the diffusion conductance for photosynthetic co2 uptake and transport was estimated according to fick s first law of diffusion by measuring gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence simultaneously an electronic circuit model for photosynthetic co2 uptake and transport through a source path sink continuum is shown in fig 1 stomatal resistance and mesophyll resistance were coupled by a series circuit with the driving force of the co2 partial pressure gradient stomatal conductance for co2 uptake gsc can be estimated according to water diffusion conductance gsw and the molecular diffusivities of water and co2 in gas giuliani et al 2013 mesophyll conductance gm which represents the conductance for co2 transport from the substomatal cavities to the carboxylation sites within chloroplasts was calculated according to the variable j method harley et al 1992 2 g m p n c i c c where pn is the net photosynthesis rate ci is the substomatal co2 concentration and cc is the chloroplastic co2 concentration pn and ci were measured by steady state gas exchange cc was estimated by combining gas exchange and chlorophyll 3 c c γ j 8 p n r d j 4 p n r d where j is the electron transport rate rd is the rate of mitochondrial respiration in the light and γ is the chloroplastic co2 compensation point r d and γ were estimated according to laisk and oja 1998 pn ci curves were performed at two irradiance levels 75 and 500 μmol m 2 s 1 at co2 concentrations ranging from 30 to 120 μmol co2 mol 1 air the intersection point of the pn ci curves was used to estimate γ x axis and rd y axis the electron transport rate j was calculated as 4 j φ psii ppfd α β where φpsii

stomatal and mesophyll resistance are coupled in a series circuit the total diffusion resistance 1 gtot for co2 transport can be calculated as 1 gtot 1 gsc 1 gm niinemets et al 2009 therefore gtot can be determined as follows 5 g t o t 1 1 g s c 1 g m the photosynthetic limitation is portioned into stomatal limitation mesophyll limitation and biochemical limitation the fraction of diffusion

intercellular co2 concentration ci was calculated under combinations of varying soil moisture and atmospheric vpd following the procedures of a previous study zhang et al 2018a briefly a pn ci curve was constructed by adjusting the ambient co2 concentration ca from 400 to 300 200 150 100 and 50 μmol mol 1 and then increasing to 400 μmol mol 1 after regaining a steady state at 400 μmol mol 1 ca was elevated gradually from 400 μmol mol 1 to 1500 μmol mol 1 carboxylation efficiency ce was determined according to a linear regression of the curve of pn versus ci with ca 200 μmol mol 1 as described in sun et al 2016 the maximum rate of rubisco carboxylation capacity vcmax and the maximal rate of electron transport jmax were calculated by the fvcb model farquhar et al 1980 and the modification long and bernacchi 2003 respectively 2 5 water use efficiency water use efficiency wue was calculated as the shoot dry biomass and fresh fruit yield per consumed unit of water defined as wue plant and wue yield respectively kadam et al 2015 reina sánchez et al 2005 2 6 statistical analysis two way analysis of variance anova was performed to test the effects of soil moisture and vpd on physiological parameters the data were compared using the duncan test data analyses were performed using the spss software version 19 0 graphics were created using origin version 8 0 3 results 3 1 coordinated effect of soil moisture and vpd on the energetic and the driving force for water movement both soil moisture and vpd affected the distribution of water potential along the soil plant atmosphere continuum as illustrated in fig 2 high vpd contributed to an excessive negative air water potential ψair the water potential gradient between the leaf and the atmosphere was far larger than the water potential gradient at the soil leaf boundary due to the excessive negative atmospheric water potential consequently the water potential drawdown was largest at the leaf air boundary along the soil plant atmosphere continuum for all the treatments this passive driving force was substantially decreased by reducing the vpd but to a lesser extent was determined by the soil water status fig 2 ψleaf was made less negative by decreasing vpd regardless of the soil water status the δψleaf air was reduced by approximately 36 in the low vpd treatment 3 2 coordinated effect of soil moisture and vpd on plant water status plant water stress was moderated by decreasing vpd for both deficit irrigation and well irrigated conditions according to the plant water relations illustrated in fig 3 no significant difference was found in osmotic potential ψπ among treatments fig 3a leaf turgor potential ψp tended to be higher in the low vpd treatments regardless of the soil moisture level fig 3b leaf relative water content rwc was highest in the combination of well irrigated conditions and low vpd and no significant differences were observed among the other treatments fig 3c the pattern of plant hydraulic conductance kplant was similar to that of leaf turgor potential which was improved by decreasing vpd fig 3d 3 3 coordinated effect of soil moisture and vpd on photosynthetic capacity the photosynthetic rate increased with elevated co2 concentration and reached a plateau in a similar pattern regardless of soil moisture and atmospheric vpd fig 4 however maximal steady state photosynthesis rates were higher in the low vpd treatment than in the high vpd treatment regardless of the deficit irrigated fig 4a or well irrigated plants fig 4b carboxylation efficiency ce maximum carboxylation rate vcmax and maximum electron transport rate jmax tended to be higher in low vpd treatment than in high vpd treatment for both deficit and well irrigated plants fig 5 ce vcmax and jmax were maximized in the combination of low vpd and well irrigated conditions deficit irrigation combined with high vpd caused the greatest photosynthetic limitation with the minimum values of ce vcmax and jmax 3 4 coordinated effect of soil moisture and vpd on diffusion conductance for photosynthetic co2 uptake and transport similar to the photosynthetic parameters the diffusion conductance for photosynthetic co2 uptake and transport was increased by different extents in the low vpd treatment regardless of soil moisture fig 6 the increases were more pronounced in deficit irrigation when compared with well irrigated conditions stomatal conductance was increased by 54 7 and 26 3 for deficit irrigation and well irrigated conditions respectively and mesophyll conductance was increased by 80 7 and 14 3 for deficit irrigation and well irrigated conditions respectively consequently the fractional constraints of the stomatal mesophyll and total diffusion limitations on photosynthesis under deficit irrigation were significantly reduced by decreasing vpd fig 7 however the contribution of the diffusion limitation imposed on photosynthesis was not significantly affected by vpd regulation under well irrigated conditions 3 5 coordination between soil moisture and vpd in regulating plant growth and productivity plant biomass production was reduced to some extent by deficit irrigation and this negative effect was offset by decreasing the vpd the dry biomass of leaf stem fruit shoot and fresh fruit yield was greatest in the combination of full irrigation and low vpd treatment fig 8 the shoot dry biomass was increased by 21 9 and 18 9 in the low vpd treatment for the deficit irrigated and well irrigated plants respectively the fresh fruit yield was increased by 35 8 and 14 6 in the low vpd treatment for the deficit and well irrigated plants respectively in the greenhouse experiments plant biomass and yield were also improved in the low vpd treatment regardless of soil water status plant biomass and fresh fruit yield were maximized in the combination of low vpd and well irrigated conditions supplementary table 1 3 6 coordination between soil moisture and vpd in regulating plant transpiration and wue deficit irrigation coupled with low vpd achieved the minimum transpiration among the combinations and no significant differences were observed among the other treatments fig 9 a plant water consumption was reduced by 24 by decreasing the excessive vpd in the deficit treatments in combination with plant productivity water use efficiency was maximized in the combination of deficit irrigation and low vpd treatments as demonstrated by fresh fruit yield wueyield and shoot dry biomass wueplant fig 9b and c the wueyield increased substantially by 60 1 and 16 3 by decreasing the excessive vpd for deficit irrigation and well irrigated conditions respectively the wueplant was increased substantially by 56 1 and 21 3 by decreasing the excessive vpd for deficit irrigation and well irrigated conditions respectively in the greenhouse experiments the cumulative water consumption was reduced in the low vpd treatment regardless of soil water status and was minimized in the combination of low vpd and deficit irrigation supplementary table 1 both wueplant and wueyield were significantly increased in the low vpd treatment regardless of soil water status and were maximized in the combination of low vpd and deficit irrigation supplementary table 1 4 discussion the present study demonstrated that the effect of soil moisture on water transport photosynthesis and water use efficiency in tomato is influenced by atmospheric vpd in contrast to the beneficial effects of deficit irrigation demonstrated in a previous study lu et al 2019 deficit irrigation coupled with high vpd significantly constrained photosynthesis and plant growth and therefore substantially decreased water use efficiency the photosynthetic limitation and productivity loss of deficit irrigation was efficiently moderated by decreasing vpd consequently deficit irrigation combined with low vpd achieved the maximum water use efficiency vpd regulation offsets the negative effect of deficit irrigation and maximizes water use efficiency as a result of three key processes 1 low vpd moderated plant water stress and compensated for stomatal limitation by mediating the energetic force driving water transport 2 within the mesophyll low vpd moderated the limitation of co2 transport from the substomatal cavity to the carboxylation site in chloroplasts by modifying leaf structures 3 deficit irrigation combined with low vpd maximized water use efficiency by reconciling the photosynthetic improvement and the transpired water savings a potential schematic model for the process by which low vpd moderated photosynthetic limitation by reducing the co2 diffusion resistance of the stomata and mesophyll is illustrated in fig 10 4 1 vpd regulation sustained stomatal openness and reduced stomatal resistance by reducing the excessive force driving water movement and moderating plant water stress stomata are the first gatekeepers for leaf photosynthetic co2 uptake and impose a great resistance stomatal openness responds to the turgor of guard cells surrounding pores lawson and blatt 2014 the turgor of the guard cells is primarily regulated by passive hydraulic mechanisms and plant water status stomatal closure occurs to prevent excessive transpiration water loss under water stress conditions stomatal closure is passively regulated by the reduced leaf water content and turgor under an excessive atmospheric evaporative demand buckley 2016 merilo et al 2018 vialet chabrand et al 2017 although stomatal closure plays a significant role in maintaining water balance the stomatal resistance for photosynthetic co2 uptake increases simultaneously with changes in leaf water content soil water stress is extensively reported as the foremost factor triggering a plant water deficit and stomatal closures christmann et al 2007 the atmospheric evaporative demand was addressed in the present study since the force driving passive water movement was greatest at the leaf air boundary along the soil plant atmosphere continuum regardless of soil moisture content the water flow rate was enlarged under high vpd according to the penman monteith equation and previous experimental evidence zhang et al 2017 in contrast to the instantaneous transpiration rate there was no significant difference in cumulative transpiration over the whole growth period between the low and high vpd treatments under well irrigated conditions cumulative water consumption is the integral of transpiration rate over leaf area and growing seasons leaf area is also an important factor determining long term plant water consumption high vpd inhibited plant growth and reduced leaf area zhang et al 2015 despite the increased transpiration rate due to high vpd the cumulative plant water consumption was potentially offset by reduced leaf area plant water status was determined by vpd to a greater extent than soil moisture in the present study no significant difference was found in ψπ among treatments which may be attributed to the osmotic adjustment in the accumulation of k na soluble sugar proline and so on vpd mediation of the force driving passive water movement was the foremost factor triggering plant water deficit plant water stress occurred even under well irrigated conditions due to the excessive force driving passive water movement the excessive force driving passive water movement and plant water stress were more pronounced with increasing vpd in the present study therefore the negative effect of deficit irrigation on water stress was aggravated under high vpd consequently stomatal resistance and the photosynthetic depression increased with soil water stress and high vpd reducing the excessive vpd efficiently maintained water balance and moderated plant water stress by decreasing the force driving passive water movement the negative effect of deficit irrigation on plant water stress was reduced when coupled with low vpd the hydraulic limitation for water movement was efficiently moderated by decreasing vpd which facilitated favorable plant water status and sustained stomatal function for photosynthetic co2 uptake fig 10 4 2 vpd regulation moderated mesophyll limitation for co2 transport from substomatal cavity to carboxylation site within chloroplasts via modifying leaf structure in contrast to previous research which attributed photosynthetic limitation to stomatal closure under varying soil moisture and vpd perez martin et al 2009 smith 1989 mesophyll resistance accounted for a large fraction of the photosynthetic limitation in the present study it was recognized that mesophyll resistance for co2 transport from the substomatal cavity to the carboxylation site within chloroplasts also significantly constrained plant photosynthesis especially for c3 plants flexas et al 2012 kaldenhoff 2012 li et al 2019 niinemets et al 2009 von caemmerer and evans 2010 in contrast to the rapid sensitive response of stomatal conductance to the external environmental variation mesophyll conductance remained relatively stable and was determined by leaf structural parameters to a large extent han et al 2018 muir et al 2014 terashima et al 2011 leaf structural traits determined the maximum diffusion conductance leaf mass area lma is a good indicator of some underlying traits such as the thickness of the lamina cell wall and mesophyll generally higher lma is associated with a thicker leaf which indicates greater drought tolerance john et al 2017 in the present study low vpd significantly reduced lma for both deficit irrigation and well irrigated conditions indicating little investment per leaf area and looser leaf structure supplementary fig 1 lma was negatively correlated with mesophyll conductance fig 11 which was consistent with previous research muir et al 2014 the negative correlation between lma and mesophyll conductance was mediated by the thickness of the lamina and tissue density a higher lma and thicker lamina or tissue in response to deficit irrigation and high vpd prevented water loss and improved drought tolerance which simultaneously increased the resistance for co2 diffusion leaf structural acclimation to long term low vpd contributed to the increase in mesophyll conductance lma was significantly decreased in low vpd grown plants which suggested a thinner and looser leaf structure the relatively loose leaf structure reduced diffusion resistance and facilitated rapid co2 transport to the chloroplast stroma within the leaf fig 10 4 3 deficit irrigation combined with low vpd maximized water use efficiency by moderating photosynthetic limitation and reducing transpiration all components of diffusion resistance were summed together total conductance was increased substantially the reduced stomatal and mesophyll resistance facilitated sufficient co2 at the sink for carbon assimilation which was the mechanistic basis for the substantial improvement in photosynthetic capacity and plant growth the extent to which the stomatal and mesophyll limitations constrained photosynthesis was significantly reduced by decreasing vpd for both well and deficit irrigation the fresh fruit yield under well irrigation in the present study approximated the commercial greenhouse tomato production lu et al 2015 the present study provided evidence that the effect of soil moisture on plant water status photosynthetic performance and water use efficiency is influenced by vpd the decreased vpd moderated photosynthetic limitation without an increase in water consumption thereby increased the beneficial effect of deficit irrigation the adverse effect of deficit irrigation was more pronounced with increasing vpd with dramatic photosynthetic limitations and a decline in water use efficiency the degree of soil water stress should be weakened when deficit irrigation is applied in arid climates with excessive atmospheric evaporative demand therefore the integrative regulation of soil and atmospheric moisture is necessary to optimize the trade off between photosynthetic carbon gain and water transport and water consumption 5 conclusions the effect of soil moisture on water movement photosynthetic co2 utilization and water use efficiency is influenced by atmospheric vpd the force driving passive water movement was efficiently reduced by decreasing vpd regardless of soil moisture low vpd decreased the diffusion resistance for co2 transport which moderated the photosynthetic limitation without increasing water consumption and therefore increased the beneficial effect of deficit irrigation the adverse effects of deficit irrigation were more pronounced under high vpd than under low vpd with a dramatic photosynthetic depression and a decline in water use efficiency water use efficiency was maximized in the combination of low vpd and deficit irrigation acknowledgement this project was supported by the natural science foundation of shandong

10846,this study estimates the evapotranspiration et from the western part of urmia lake basin iran to provide quality spatio temporal evapotranspiration information for use in achieving regional sustainable water management a mapping evapotranspiration with internalized calibration metric et estimation model was adopted to estimate monthly et for the period between 2014 2016 using landsat 8 satellite imagery several refinements are made to adjust the model to the local environment the refinements include estimating evaporation from the saline lake correction of the underestimation of city surface temperature through the modification of thermal emissivity as well as modifications of minor assumptions applied in metric the estimation results for et obtained using metric were compared with independent estimation of et using the fao 56 approach in order to assess the estimation accuracy the comparison showed good correlation between the two types of estimation results for irrigated agriculture implying successful estimation of et in this region et estimated in non irrigated bare soil fields was prone to overestimation the novelty of this study lies in the fact that this is the first et data for this basin with 100 m spatio temporal resolution and accuracy information therefore the estimation procedure and results are expected to contribute to a better understanding of the regional hydrology this is necessary both for the restoration of urmia lake and for achieving sustainable water management in the region keywords evapotranspiration urmia lake basin metric remote sensing energy balance 1 introduction urmia lake an endorheic salt lake located in northwestern iran is one of the primary salt lakes in the world the lake has high saline content at 217 235 g l 1 ghaheri et al 1999 or up to 300 g l 1 farzin et al 2012 the total surface area of the lake has been reported as between 4750 and 6100 km2 and its maximum depth is 16 m eimanifar and mohebbi 2007 however urmia lake has been shrinking rapidly because of multiple factors including climate change and overuse of water for agriculture hassanzadeh et al 2012 hence better understanding of basin hydrology and management of water resources have become urgent challenges farajzadeh et al 2014 the shrinking of the lake is indicative of an imbalance in regional water supply and use the urmia lake restoration program ulrp put forward by the iranian government has been working towards stabilizing and increasing the lake s water level by achieving sustainable water management in the basin evapotranspiration et is one of the key factors in basin scale hydrology in closed basins such as urmia long term withdrawal of water from the basin either from the surface or subsurface is roughly approximated as precipitation minus et thus the estimation of et is important in determining the accepted level of water use in recent years several et estimation models based on satellite based remote sensing have been developed satellite based et models provide spatio temporal information of et from fields regions and basins the unique information generated has led to a new era in agricultural and environmental water management tasumi et al 2019 there are three primary types of satellite based et estimation approaches vegetation based land surface temperature based and scatterplot triangle approaches biggs et al 2016 in a review of satellite based et estimation approaches losgedaragh and rahimzadegan 2018 suggest that the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998a b mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution and with internalized calibration metric allen et al 2007a b and surface energy balance system sebs su 2002 are the most popular methods all the three popular models are categorized as land surface temperature based approaches by biggs et al 2016 in this study we adopt the metric model which can accurately estimate et because of the internal calibration procedure incorporated in the model for irrigated agricultural area the model has been applied in several regions in the world e g trezza et al 2013 numata et al 2017 madugundu et al 2017 losgedaragh and rahimzadegan 2018 applied the metric model to the region near tehran in order to estimate evaporation from fresh water surface in the context of urmia lake basin javadian et al 2019 applied the metric model with modis imagery 1 km thermal resolution to estimate actual et in basin scale while modis based et map provides useful information for large scale water balance and hydrology the coarse spatial resolution prevents quantitative assessment of the et estimation accuracy this study applies the metric model using landsat thermal resolution 100 m to determine et in the western urmia lake basin with quantitative information of the estimation accuracy two primary technical issues are addressed in this study the first is the necessity of local refinements to the metric model as reported by allen et al 2013 for the example of the terrain problem the model requires some local refinements to improve et estimation local refinements are made through an iterative process during image processing thus this work also provides a case study of the application of local refinements another challenge is accuracy assessment of the estimated result in this study the estimated et is compared with independently estimated et values to determine the estimation quality in an area where no ground measurement data is available for validation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data used the study area was the western part of urmia lake basin which lies in the coverage of path 169 row 34 of landsat 8 satellite images fig 1 the study area covers urmia lake the primary irrigated agricultural area of urmia some other minor irrigated agricultural areas and a wide rain fed wheat agriculture or rangelands spread over the hillside and mountainous region extending till the western border of the basin urmia city is located at the western part of urmia lake urmia weather station operated by the islamic republic of iran meteorological organization irimo is also located at the western part of the lake the weather station is surrounded by irrigated agricultural areas elevation varies from around 1250 m at urmia lake to 2000 3000 m above sea level at the western boundaries of the basin average annual temperature at the urmia station is 11 7 c 10 year average over 2007 2016 where the minimum monthly temperature is in january 1 9 c and the maximum in july 24 4 c the average annual precipitation is 294 mm where approximately 20 40 mm of precipitation is expected each month from october to june while almost no precipitation occurs between july and september the satellite observed precipitation distribution indicates that precipitation increases toward the mountainous regions with approximately 500 700 mm of annual precipitation expected at the western border of the basin recently water surface area of the urmia lake experienced significant changes year on year fig 1 particularly in the southern regions of the lake where the lake bed is occasionally exposed during the summer and fall season in the period between 2014 2016 2015 had the minimum and 2016 had the maximum lake surface area which agrees with the trend of annual precipitation observed at the urmia weather station the minimum and maximum surface area in august was 1550 km2 and 2500 km2 in 2015 and 2016 respectively the lake surface is much smaller than the values reported by eimanifar and mohebbi 2007 4750 6100 km2 clearly showing the rapid shrink of the lake in recent years apples are the most commonly irrigated crop in the study area they are typically cultivated with hey crops such as alfalfa planted underneath the apple trees with a long period of irrigation compared to other primary crops in the region the recent increase in apple cultivation has been considered one of the primary reasons for the shrinking of the lake other primary irrigated crops are grapes peaches wheat sugar beets and vegetables surface irrigation using surface and ground water has been the major irrigation method however the application of drip irrigation has been gradually increased rain fed wheat fields extend over the hillsides where chickpeas are occasionally grown for crop rotation purposes this study estimates evapotranspiration in the study area using landsat 8 satellite images with a metric model for the period between 2014 2016 the primary input data for the model include both shortwave and thermal observations of landsat 8 images a digital elevation model and locally measured weather data four field visits were conducted in 2017 and 2018 during the field visits information on agricultural meteorological and water management practices were obtained through interviews with local government organizations and individual farmers table 1 summarizes the landsat 8 images used in the study images dates highlighted in dark gray indicate cloud covered images that were not usable the dates highlighted in light gray indicate winter images wherein energy balance computations using metric were not feasible owing to snow cover and or homogeneous soil moisture conditions due to precipitation these winter images were used only for detecting the snow covered area the metric model was applied to all other images fortunately clear sky images were available at least once per month between april and november aster gdem version 2 was used as the digital elevation model dem weather data measured at the urmia weather station operated by irimo obtained via the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa of the united states were used as representative weather data in the study area after quality control 2 2 metric model metric allen et al 2007a solves the energy balance for the moment captured in satellite image acquisition et mm hr 1 is estimated as the residual of the energy balance as 1 e t 3600 r n g h λ ρ w where rn g and h w m 2 are the net radiation soil heat and sensible heat flux respectively λ j kg 1 is the latent heat of vaporization ρw kg m 3 is the density of water and the constant 3600 is the conversion factor from seconds to hours net radiation is computed by analyzing solar radiation estimation by taking into consideration the atmospheric transmissivity surface reflectance and longwave emission balance using satellite shortwave and thermal observation data the equation can be represented as follows 2 r n 1 α r s ε r l d r l u where α is surface albedo derived by satellite shortwave observations ε is thermal emissivity derived by satellite observed vegetation index rs w m 2 is the solar radiation rld w m 2 is the incoming longwave radiation empirically determined by air transmissivity rlu w m 2 is the outgoing longwave radiation derived by satellite thermal observation soil heat flux is estimated as a ratio of rn using surface conditions such as vegetation and temperature observed by satellite the estimation of sensible heat flux is key to the metric model sensible heat flux h is expressed as 3 h ρ a c p δ t r a h where ρa kg m 3 is the air density cp j kg 1 k 1 is the specific heat of air at constant pressure δt k is the near surface vertical temperature difference and rah s m 1 is the aerodynamic resistance corresponding to δt metric takes an iterative approach to analyze δt and rah together and calibrates the model to estimate et adequately using the information read from two specific pixels of the image called the cold pixel and hot pixel following the approaches pioneered by sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998a the δt determination process is visualized in fig 2 et from two specific pixels i e cold and hot pixels are assigned by operators then h for these two specific pixels can be derived using eq 1 the combined values of δt and rah in eq 3 are iteratively determined for these two pixels by initially assuming neutral stability and then updating the air stability condition using monin obukhov length for the given wind speed and the surface roughness length the relationship between surface temperature and δt analyzed using the two specific pixels is applied to the entire image the resulting et at the moment of satellite image is converted to an index called etr fraction etrf etrf enables the conversion of the instantaneous et information to a daily or monthly basis 4 e t r f e t e t r where etr mm h 1 is the alfalfa reference evapotranspiration defined by american society of civil engineers asce ewri 2005 and computed from weather data monthly or seasonal et is estimated by inverting eq 4 as et etrf x etr using etrf values interpolated for the days between satellite images and etr computed from ground measured weather data at least one clear sky image per month is recommended for successful et estimation in irrigated agricultural areas allen et al 2007a 2 3 et estimation procedure fig 3 shows the flowchart for et estimation in this study the metric model requires an iterative process to tune the model to the target area preliminary results were evaluated to identify problems in model application solutions for these problems were then derived through analysis the procedures for the solution of the problems were incorporated into the metric model as local refinements before obtaining the final results initially the metric model allen et al 2007a was applied to the landsat images with atmospheric corrections tasumi et al 2008 terrain corrections for radiation allen et al 2006 and corrections for aerodynamic processes allen et al 2013 minor local refinements included 1 cold pixel selection and value assignment cold pixels that provide information for internal calibration of metric were selected from active fully covered irrigated short crops when feasible and etrf was assigned as 0 95 instead of the suggested value of 1 05 the 9 reduction of cold pixel etrf from the suggested value corresponds to the difference in irrigation methods between the study area surface irrigation is the dominant and the southern idaho united states where the suggested value was developed center pivot or line sprinkler irrigation is the dominant the total amount of irrigation requirements tends to be higher in surface irrigation than in sprinkler irrigation primarily due to larger percolation and conveyance losses however et from cropping field itself is approximately 9 lower in surface irrigation than sprinkler for example of temperate cereals and root crops jägermeyr et al 2015 because sprinkler irrigation tends to keep the surface and root zone wetter in addition to the evaporation by interception which is negligible in the case of surface irrigation further reductions of cold pixel etrf were made for early spring and late fall images when the active fully covered irrigated short crops were not easily found as recommended by allen et al 2007a 2 hot pixel selection and value assignment on determination of hot pixel etrf the soil water balance model in the fao 56 manual allen et al 1998 was applied assuming the soil type as silt loam zavieh et al 2018 as recommended by allen et al 2007a as a minor modification a simple snow melting process was incorporated in the soil water balance model assuming that precipitation on days when air temperature is below zero is snow haddeland et al 2011 harder and pomeroy 2014 the computational results of the soil water balance model are shown in fig 4 3 determination of surface roughness length the roughness estimation equation in metric is best for bare soil to short crop surfaces the equation was applied to all surfaces except for the city and tree cover orchard in this study the city and tree covered areas were identified from satellite images and roughness was separately assigned 4 limitations of δt in sensible heat estimation in metric sensible heat is estimated using eq 3 wherein δt is determined using two calibration points cold and hot pixels the estimations of δt and sensible heat are stabilized if the surface conditions lie in between the cold and hot pixel conditions however in some pixels with extreme surface conditions unrealistically high or low sensible heat might be computed by the model to address this issue the maximum and minimum limits for the δt estimation procedure were set to prevent extreme unrealistic δt values in terms of availability of surface energy 5 evaporation from snow surfaces accurate estimation of evaporation from snow surfaces is difficult using metric because the snow covered condition violates some important assumptions adopted in metric such as that used to estimate δt and metric disregards latent heat of melting in the energy balance computations as the evaporation from snow surface is expected to be small on average kojima 1984 kojima et al 1985 it was approximated as zero in this study in addition to the above listed refinements the following two items were investigated during the study the solutions are described and discussed in the results section 6 evaporation from the lake the metric model is not applicable to estimating lake evaporation without local calibration allen et al 2007a the estimation of evaporation from a lake surface is difficult because solar radiation penetrates water water bodies have large heat capacities and the advection of heat can easily occur with water flow in this study the empirical evaporation estimation method for urmia lake is investigated through literature reviews 7 evapotranspiration from city areas preliminary et estimation results indicated a large amount of et from city areas in the fall season however field surveys indicated that the large et in city areas in the fall was overestimated in this study the reasons for the overestimation are investigated and the solution is suggested 2 4 accuracy assessment validation is one of the most challenging problems in satellite based et estimation researches li et al 2009 because of factors such as advection the ground measured et itself can have more than 20 measured by eddy covariance or up to 29 measured by eddy covariance error moreover ground measured et typically does not represent et from the area of satellite image pixel therefore large uncertainties in validation is typically inevitable even if ground measured et data is available while no actual ground measured et data were available in the study area this study attempts to assess the et estimation accuracy via comparisons with et estimated using the fao 56 allen et al 1998 which was proposed by stancalie et al 2010 in their work fao 56 is a widely accepted method for field et estimation pereira et al 2015 however fao 56 can only estimate et for adequately watered healthy cropping fields unless detailed data i e quantity and timing of precipitation and irrigation of the water application in the target field is available in addition the comparison must be made in large homogeneous fields more than 200 m by 200 m i e twice the thermal resolution of landsat 8 unfortunately the typical field size in the urmia irrigation area is less than 50 m by 50 m and several different types of crops are cultivated based on the field survey some apples and one grape field were the only irrigated crops where a large extent of homogeneous cultivation areas could be found in the study area some non irrigated bare soil surfaces located near the weather station were another possible locations to estimate et by fao 56 for such bare soil surface the quantity and the timing of water application can be assigned as the precipitation data recorded by the weather station which enable fao 56 to estimate et the actual quantity and the timing of precipitation can deviate from the weather data if the location of bare soil is far from the weather station in this study large bare soil surfaces located within around 15 km from the weather station were selected upon field et estimation using fao 56 a single crop coefficient kc approach was adopted kc values and lengths of crop development stages were provided in the literature fao 56 estimates et only from a specific beginning date typically in spring to a specific end date typically in the fall of cultivation to account for inevitable et from fields during the remainder of the year typically in winter the kc of the initial development stage was assigned for apples and kc estimated by the soil water balance model was assigned for grapes during the period this follows from the common practice among farmers in the urmia region rain fed wheat is also a primary crop in the study area that has a significant share in the cultivation area however wheat was omitted from comparison for the accuracy assessment because fao 56 cannot estimate actual et for the rain fed wheat only with the information available in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 local refinements 3 1 1 evaporation from urmia lake table 2 summarizes annual lake evaporation and air temperature data obtained from the literature some of the numbers in the table were obtained from graphs in the source materials temperature data comprise air temperatures either at water surfaces or at nearby weather stations fig 5 illustrates the plot of data presented in table 2 in cases where the climate conditions were not excessively different the annual amount of lake evaporation tended to be linear relative to the annual air temperature croley ii et al 1998 kondo 2000 tasumi 2005 because higher air temperature causes the lake to use more energy in evaporation and less energy in sensible heat kondo 2000 according to raoult s law evaporation from salt water becomes less than evaporation from fresh water if other weather and energy conditions are constant however evaporation from saline lakes tends to be greater than that from fresh water lakes in fig 5 this could be attributed to the fact that saline lakes tend to be located in arid and semi arid regions that promote evaporation because of low humidity the two sources for the dead sea reported annual evaporation values that were different by 300 mm yr 1 which might indicate the difficulty and uncertainty in lake evaporation observation and estimation evaporation reported by dead sea 1 is equivalent to evaporation from other saline lakes located in much colder regions which might be an indication of underestimation because temperature is an important factor that controls annual evaporation evaporation from urmia lake has been reported as 1171 mm yr 1 jalili et al 2012 which was derived from a class a pan observation installed near the lake and filled with lake saline water however evaporation from a class a pan installed near a lake is known to be greater than evaporation from the lake surface owing to differences in humidity conditions leading to differences on the order of for example 20 40 jensen et al 2016 thus the reported 1171 mm yr 1 might be an overestimation considering the theoretical relationship between temperature and evaporation with empirical linearity reported for fresh water lakes and uncertainties available in literature information this study suggest eq 5 to estimate evaporation from urmia lake the equation expresses the solid line shown in fig 5 which was drawn by connecting evaporation from great salt lake and the dead sea 2 assuming these two literature values are relatively reliable the annual average temperature of urmia varies from 10 7 c to 13 1 c during 2007 2016 and the eq 5 is used only for the short temperature range 5 eannual 34 x tair annual 660 where eannual is annual evaporation from urmia lake mm yr 1 and tair annual is annual air temperature c at the weather station near the lake the equation suggests about 10 lower evaporation from urmia lake compared to the value reported by jalili et al 2012 which might explain the difference between pan evaporation and lake evaporation relative to fresh water lakes eq 5 suggests higher evaporation especially in cold temperature regions this is possible because saline lakes have lower freezing points and shorter ice cover periods in winter in cold regions than fresh water lakes which promotes evaporation compared to fresh water lakes a sensitivity analysis for qinghai lake in china indicated that the annual water surface evaporation increases by 16 saline content 187 5 g l 1 when compared to fresh water lakes because of the impact of reduction in the freezing point momoki 1994 while the annual evaporation largely depends on the air temperature monthly trends in lake evaporation are largely affected by the lake depth tasumi 2005 shallow lakes such as urmia lake are expected to have monthly evaporation trends similar to pan evaporation or reference et tasumi 2005 accepting this assumption the estimated annual evaporation suggested in eq 5 is distributed to each month according to the distribution ratio determined by the long term average month to year ratio of etr in the urmia lake table 3 3 1 2 evapotranspiration from city areas the overestimation of et in city areas especially in the fall season was caused by the cold estimated surface temperature at city areas to empirically overcome this problem two types of corrections were made for city areas the first correction was to improve thermal emissivity metric estimates thermal emissivity using a leaf area index that assumes natural and agricultural surfaces rather than cities thus the minimum emissivity for the landsat thermal band was set as 0 97 however commercial areas can have much lower emissivity compared to natural type surfaces roberts et al 2012 which causes the underestimation of surface temperature in city areas in this study based on the analysis of spectral emissivity data by roberts et al 2012 0 93 was assigned for emissivity in densely built city areas the second correction was made to reduce the impact of shadows on et estimation in city areas field surveys indicated that building shadows cause erroneously cold temperature readings in city areas in the fall the problem is due to the difference in direction between sunlight and satellite observation the city temperature would be observed as much higher if measured from the same direction as the sunlight however as satellite observation is conducted from the nadir angle the satellite sees a large portion of shadows cast by buildings the shadowed area is largest in winter when the sun angle is lowest at the satellite overpass time however the impact of shadows on et estimation is largest during fall in urmia because the surfaces are dry in the fall the impact of shadows on et estimation is not obvious in wet seasons because the surface temperatures of shadowed and sunny surfaces do not differ significantly this problem was empirically solved by artificially increasing the surface temperature in city areas by 1 0 4 7 c the ratio of the increment was determined by analyzing the shadow covered area for each satellite image for a typical size and density of buildings in urmia city fig 6 and analyzing the expected temperature difference between shadowed and non shadowed areas 3 2 accuracy assessment et for the satellite image acquisition dates were computed through metric model processing applied with local refinements the monthly and annual et were estimated by interpolating etrf values in between two satellite image dates the estimation results were further evaluated for some sample locations by comparing with independently estimated et following the fao 56 manual allen et al 1998 seven locations were selected for accuracy assessment and another eight locations were selected for additional discussion table 4 fig 7 shows the estimated monthly and annual et maps with the locations selected for accuracy assessment august is a dry season and thus et was small in natural conditions such as rangeland while a large amount of et was estimated in irrigated areas 3 2 1 accuracy assessment for satellite image acquisition dates fig 8 shows the comparison between fao 56 and metric estimated et hereafter etfao56 and etmetric for the satellite image acquisition dates during 2014 2016 etfao56 for location 4 could not be estimated for 2014 2015 because the field was not well managed during the period assuming that the difference between etfao56 and etmetric is the estimation error of metric mean bias error mbe for apple grape and bare soils were 0 20 0 16 and 0 36 mm d 1 respectively where the positive number indicates over estimation the mean absolute error mae were 0 57 0 72 and 0 59 mm d 1 respectively root mean square error rmse were 0 73 0 84 and 0 68 mm d 1 respectively the estimation accuracy obtained in this study for the satellite image acquisition dates was similar to a metric application for well managed almond field in california mbe ranges from 0 32 to 0 37 rmse ranges from 0 49 to 0 93 mm d 1 he et al 2017 and better than for salinity affected pistachio field mbe 0 5 rmse 1 4 mm d 1 jin et al 2018 while the average et widely varies from bare soil 0 41 mm d 1 to apple 5 29 mm d 1 mbe mae and rmse tended to be similar among the three different landuse types indicating that the error range in metric tends to be constant not proportional to the amount of et occurring the estimation accuracy was high in wet i e apple conditions intermediate in moderate i e grape conditions and low in dry i e bare soil conditions if the error is expressed in percentage of actual et rmse 0 73 mm d 1 for apple is equivalent to 14 of the average et and it is better than typical uncertainty of et observation by eddy covariance 20 wilson et al 2002 li et al 2009 in contrast rmse 0 68 mm d 1 for bare soil is equivalent to 166 of the average et for bare soil it should be noted that accurately estimating tiny et from dry surface was difficult in this metric application 3 2 2 accuracy assessment for monthly and annual timescale fig 9 shows the monthly estimated etmetric and etfao56 values for apple grape and bare soil mbe lied between 0 1 to 8 3 mm mo 1 mae was between 9 0 to 16 0 mm mo 1 rmse was between 10 8 to 20 5 mm mo 1 etmetric for the three apple fields representing wet agricultural conditions was in good agreement to etfao56 throughout a year except some early spring months a part of the error in early spring may have been caused by less frequent satellite observations given that march is a cloudy season table 1 another possible reason is that the actual difference of et from individual field that is not reflected in etfao56 in this study accounts for the error in etmetric although farmers in the study area occasionally irrigate apple fields even during winter for pest management regular irrigation typically starts from april or may depending on the area and the individual farmers thus larger variations in soil water content caused by difference in field management by farmers are expected between march to april which is not accounted for in etfao56 values for bare soil surfaces etmetric was overestimated in the dry season in summer the selected bare soil fields received almost no rain from july to september during 2014 2016 and evaporation is expected to be very small only over estimation can occur in such conditions because there is no room to underestimate et moreover etr is high in summer because of the rich solar radiation as shown in eq 4 a small error in etrf estimated by metric can be magnified in terms of the et for the period when etr is high in annual integrated et fig 10 mbe for applies is 2 67 mm yr 1 61 mm yr 1 for grape and 29 99 mm yr 1 for bare soils the samples of irrigated agriculture had mbe equivalent to less than 10 of et which is regarded as accurate in the context of agricultural water management according to farmers the typical amount of irrigation for apple plantation in the area is about 1800 mm yr 1 this study shows that about 60 of water entering the field sum of precipitation and irrigation is consumed as et on the other hand etmetric must be used cautiously to bare soils and rangeland although mbe 29 99 mm yr 1 might be an acceptable range of error in surface energy balance it is not negligible if compared to the precipitation long term average is 294 mm yr 1 some uncertainties are inevitable in this accuracy assessment approach however similar uncertainties might be inevitable even if ground measured et data are available fig 11 shows the metric estimated results for location numbers 8 to 15 in table 4 the estimated annual et values from three rain fed wheat fields are distributed from 316 to 652 mm yr 1 according to fao 56 an adequately watered wheat field in this area requires approximately 670 mm yr 1 of et including the inevitable et during non cultivation season thus the most rain fed wheat in this area should have been water stressed which is in agreement with actual conditions confirmed by the field surveys the water stress condition can also be confirmed via the ndvi from satellite observations fig 12 shows the ndvi and etmetric of the satellite images for the three rain fed wheat fields note that dotted lines in the etmetric graphs are to visually aid the reader they do not represent the way of interpolation of et in between the satellite image strong peak ndvi implying favorable growing of the wheat were recognized only for years 2014 and 2015 in location 9 and year 2015 in location 10 etmetric for these three cases were 652 605 and 470 mm yr 1 where the etmetric for the two favorable growing years in location 9 were close to the reference value by fao 56 for healthy wheat in fig 12 location year having low ndvi tend to show low et indicating that metric sees the water stress condition via the estimated amount of et the estimated et from irrigated short crops loc 11 13 fig 11 is difficult to evaluate or discuss because of the small field size and the complex crop types and timings each of the data shown as loc 11 13 contains several different types of short crops with some minor horticulture and residential areas at the least estimated et for irrigated short crops lies in the range between irrigated apple and rain fed wheat which is an expected range of et for this landuse type annual et from densely built city centers was estimated as 136 to 192 mm if the annual precipitation at urmia station is representative of the city areas in case of 2016 192 mm out of 321 mm is used in et and the rest 129 mm is drained the discussion for urmia lake surface evaporation was already presented in the previous section as a limitation of accuracy assessment no evaluation was attempted for mountainous regions near the border of the basin owing to a lack of information about evapotranspiration there 4 conclusion this study estimated the et from the western part of the urmia lake basin to provide quality information on spatio temporal et in the basin with landsat resolution monthly et was estimated for a period of three years from 2014 to 2016 by applying the metric model with several local refinements the estimation accuracies were evaluated using independently estimated et by fao 56 method for irrigated apple and grape fields and for non irrigated bare soil land the rmse was 0 68 0 84 mm d 1 for the satellite image acquisition dates and 10 8 20 5 mm d 1 for monthly estimations the estimation accuracy was comparable to other similar applications the error range in metric tended to be constant for a wide variety of et amount and it derived high relative accuracy for wet apple fields and low relative accuracy for dry bare soil surfaces the study area also experienced limited precipitation during july to september and evaporation was minimal in non irrigated bare soils in such situations only over estimation can occur because there is no room to underestimate et thus the derived values of 29 99 mm yr 1 tend to be overestimations in bare soil and the amount is not negligible when compared to the annual precipitation 294 mm estimated et for rain fed wheat fields was in good agreement with the evapotranspirative requirement of healthy wheat for the well growing fields while et was lower for the fields having weak crops this was indicative of the fact that the metric model captures the water stress condition of the crops via et although there are uncertainties in terms of the accuracy assessment of this approach the comparison results indicate successful estimation of et in this region this work provides the first evapotranspiration data for this basin with this spatio temporal resolution and accuracy information therefore the estimation procedure and its results are expected to contribute to a better understanding of regional hydrology this is necessary both for restoration of urmia lake and for achieving sustainable water management in the region declaration of competing

10846,this study estimates the evapotranspiration et from the western part of urmia lake basin iran to provide quality spatio temporal evapotranspiration information for use in achieving regional sustainable water management a mapping evapotranspiration with internalized calibration metric et estimation model was adopted to estimate monthly et for the period between 2014 2016 using landsat 8 satellite imagery several refinements are made to adjust the model to the local environment the refinements include estimating evaporation from the saline lake correction of the underestimation of city surface temperature through the modification of thermal emissivity as well as modifications of minor assumptions applied in metric the estimation results for et obtained using metric were compared with independent estimation of et using the fao 56 approach in order to assess the estimation accuracy the comparison showed good correlation between the two types of estimation results for irrigated agriculture implying successful estimation of et in this region et estimated in non irrigated bare soil fields was prone to overestimation the novelty of this study lies in the fact that this is the first et data for this basin with 100 m spatio temporal resolution and accuracy information therefore the estimation procedure and results are expected to contribute to a better understanding of the regional hydrology this is necessary both for the restoration of urmia lake and for achieving sustainable water management in the region keywords evapotranspiration urmia lake basin metric remote sensing energy balance 1 introduction urmia lake an endorheic salt lake located in northwestern iran is one of the primary salt lakes in the world the lake has high saline content at 217 235 g l 1 ghaheri et al 1999 or up to 300 g l 1 farzin et al 2012 the total surface area of the lake has been reported as between 4750 and 6100 km2 and its maximum depth is 16 m eimanifar and mohebbi 2007 however urmia lake has been shrinking rapidly because of multiple factors including climate change and overuse of water for agriculture hassanzadeh et al 2012 hence better understanding of basin hydrology and management of water resources have become urgent challenges farajzadeh et al 2014 the shrinking of the lake is indicative of an imbalance in regional water supply and use the urmia lake restoration program ulrp put forward by the iranian government has been working towards stabilizing and increasing the lake s water level by achieving sustainable water management in the basin evapotranspiration et is one of the key factors in basin scale hydrology in closed basins such as urmia long term withdrawal of water from the basin either from the surface or subsurface is roughly approximated as precipitation minus et thus the estimation of et is important in determining the accepted level of water use in recent years several et estimation models based on satellite based remote sensing have been developed satellite based et models provide spatio temporal information of et from fields regions and basins the unique information generated has led to a new era in agricultural and environmental water management tasumi et al 2019 there are three primary types of satellite based et estimation approaches vegetation based land surface temperature based and scatterplot triangle approaches biggs et al 2016 in a review of satellite based et estimation approaches losgedaragh and rahimzadegan 2018 suggest that the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998a b mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution and with internalized calibration metric allen et al 2007a b and surface energy balance system sebs su 2002 are the most popular methods all the three popular models are categorized as land surface temperature based approaches by biggs et al 2016 in this study we adopt the metric model which can accurately estimate et because of the internal calibration procedure incorporated in the model for irrigated agricultural area the model has been applied in several regions in the world e g trezza et al 2013 numata et al 2017 madugundu et al 2017 losgedaragh and rahimzadegan 2018 applied the metric model to the region near tehran in order to estimate evaporation from fresh water surface in the context of urmia lake basin javadian et al 2019 applied the metric model with modis imagery 1 km thermal resolution to estimate actual et in basin scale while modis based et map provides useful information for large scale water balance and hydrology the coarse spatial resolution prevents quantitative assessment of the et estimation accuracy this study applies the metric model using landsat thermal resolution 100 m to determine et in the western urmia lake basin with quantitative information of the estimation accuracy two primary technical issues are addressed in this study the first is the necessity of local refinements to the metric model as reported by allen et al 2013 for the example of the terrain problem the model requires some local refinements to improve et estimation local refinements are made through an iterative process during image processing thus this work also provides a case study of the application of local refinements another challenge is accuracy assessment of the estimated result in this study the estimated et is compared with independently estimated et values to determine the estimation quality in an area where no ground measurement data is available for validation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data used the study area was the western part of urmia lake basin which lies in the coverage of path 169 row 34 of landsat 8 satellite images fig 1 the study area covers urmia lake the primary irrigated agricultural area of urmia some other minor irrigated agricultural areas and a wide rain fed wheat agriculture or rangelands spread over the hillside and mountainous region extending till the western border of the basin urmia city is located at the western part of urmia lake urmia weather station operated by the islamic republic of iran meteorological organization irimo is also located at the western part of the lake the weather station is surrounded by irrigated agricultural areas elevation varies from around 1250 m at urmia lake to 2000 3000 m above sea level at the western boundaries of the basin average annual temperature at the urmia station is 11 7 c 10 year average over 2007 2016 where the minimum monthly temperature is in january 1 9 c and the maximum in july 24 4 c the average annual precipitation is 294 mm where approximately 20 40 mm of precipitation is expected each month from october to june while almost no precipitation occurs between july and september the satellite observed precipitation distribution indicates that precipitation increases toward the mountainous regions with approximately 500 700 mm of annual precipitation expected at the western border of the basin recently water surface area of the urmia lake experienced significant changes year on year fig 1 particularly in the southern regions of the lake where the lake bed is occasionally exposed during the summer and fall season in the period between 2014 2016 2015 had the minimum and 2016 had the maximum lake surface area which agrees with the trend of annual precipitation observed at the urmia weather station the minimum and maximum surface area in august was 1550 km2 and 2500 km2 in 2015 and 2016 respectively the lake surface is much smaller than the values reported by eimanifar and mohebbi 2007 4750 6100 km2 clearly showing the rapid shrink of the lake in recent years apples are the most commonly irrigated crop in the study area they are typically cultivated with hey crops such as alfalfa planted underneath the apple trees with a long period of irrigation compared to other primary crops in the region the recent increase in apple cultivation has been considered one of the primary reasons for the shrinking of the lake other primary irrigated crops are grapes peaches wheat sugar beets and vegetables surface irrigation using surface and ground water has been the major irrigation method however the application of drip irrigation has been gradually increased rain fed wheat fields extend over the hillsides where chickpeas are occasionally grown for crop rotation purposes this study estimates evapotranspiration in the study area using landsat 8 satellite images with a metric model for the period between 2014 2016 the primary input data for the model include both shortwave and thermal observations of landsat 8 images a digital elevation model and locally measured weather data four field visits were conducted in 2017 and 2018 during the field visits information on agricultural meteorological and water management practices were obtained through interviews with local government organizations and individual farmers table 1 summarizes the landsat 8 images used in the study images dates highlighted in dark gray indicate cloud covered images that were not usable the dates highlighted in light gray indicate winter images wherein energy balance computations using metric were not feasible owing to snow cover and or homogeneous soil moisture conditions due to precipitation these winter images were used only for detecting the snow covered area the metric model was applied to all other images fortunately clear sky images were available at least once per month between april and november aster gdem version 2 was used as the digital elevation model dem weather data measured at the urmia weather station operated by irimo obtained via the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa of the united states were used as representative weather data in the study area after quality control 2 2 metric model metric allen et al 2007a solves the energy balance for the moment captured in satellite image acquisition et mm hr 1 is estimated as the residual of the energy balance as 1 e t 3600 r n g h λ ρ w where rn g and h w m 2 are the net radiation soil heat and sensible heat flux respectively λ j kg 1 is the latent heat of vaporization ρw kg m 3 is the density of water and the constant 3600 is the conversion factor from seconds to hours net radiation is computed by analyzing solar radiation estimation by taking into consideration the atmospheric transmissivity surface reflectance and longwave emission balance using satellite shortwave and thermal observation data the equation can be represented as follows 2 r n 1 α r s ε r l d r l u where α is surface albedo derived by satellite shortwave observations ε is thermal emissivity derived by satellite observed vegetation index rs w m 2 is the solar radiation rld w m 2 is the incoming longwave radiation empirically determined by air transmissivity rlu w m 2 is the outgoing longwave radiation derived by satellite thermal observation soil heat flux is estimated as a ratio of rn using surface conditions such as vegetation and temperature observed by satellite the estimation of sensible heat flux is key to the metric model sensible heat flux h is expressed as 3 h ρ a c p δ t r a h where ρa kg m 3 is the air density cp j kg 1 k 1 is the specific heat of air at constant pressure δt k is the near surface vertical temperature difference and rah s m 1 is the aerodynamic resistance corresponding to δt metric takes an iterative approach to analyze δt and rah together and calibrates the model to estimate et adequately using the information read from two specific pixels of the image called the cold pixel and hot pixel following the approaches pioneered by sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998a the δt determination process is visualized in fig 2 et from two specific pixels i e cold and hot pixels are assigned by operators then h for these two specific pixels can be derived using eq 1 the combined values of δt and rah in eq 3 are iteratively determined for these two pixels by initially assuming neutral stability and then updating the air stability condition using monin obukhov length for the given wind speed and the surface roughness length the relationship between surface temperature and δt analyzed using the two specific pixels is applied to the entire image the resulting et at the moment of satellite image is converted to an index called etr fraction etrf etrf enables the conversion of the instantaneous et information to a daily or monthly basis 4 e t r f e t e t r where etr mm h 1 is the alfalfa reference evapotranspiration defined by american society of civil engineers asce ewri 2005 and computed from weather data monthly or seasonal et is estimated by inverting eq 4 as et etrf x etr using etrf values interpolated for the days between satellite images and etr computed from ground measured weather data at least one clear sky image per month is recommended for successful et estimation in irrigated agricultural areas allen et al 2007a 2 3 et estimation procedure fig 3 shows the flowchart for et estimation in this study the metric model requires an iterative process to tune the model to the target area preliminary results were evaluated to identify problems in model application solutions for these problems were then derived through analysis the procedures for the solution of the problems were incorporated into the metric model as local refinements before obtaining the final results initially the metric model allen et al 2007a was applied to the landsat images with atmospheric corrections tasumi et al 2008 terrain corrections for radiation allen et al 2006 and corrections for aerodynamic processes allen et al 2013 minor local refinements included 1 cold pixel selection and value assignment cold pixels that provide information for internal calibration of metric were selected from active fully covered irrigated short crops when feasible and etrf was assigned as 0 95 instead of the suggested value of 1 05 the 9 reduction of cold pixel etrf from the suggested value corresponds to the difference in irrigation methods between the study area surface irrigation is the dominant and the southern idaho united states where the suggested value was developed center pivot or line sprinkler irrigation is the dominant the total amount of irrigation requirements tends to be higher in surface irrigation than in sprinkler irrigation primarily due to larger percolation and conveyance losses however et from cropping field itself is approximately 9 lower in surface irrigation than sprinkler for example of temperate cereals and root crops jägermeyr et al 2015 because sprinkler irrigation tends to keep the surface and root zone wetter in addition to the evaporation by interception which is negligible in the case of surface irrigation further reductions of cold pixel etrf were made for early spring and late fall images when the active fully covered irrigated short crops were not easily found as recommended by allen et al 2007a 2 hot pixel selection and value assignment on determination of hot pixel etrf the soil water balance model in the fao 56 manual allen et al 1998 was applied assuming the soil type as silt loam zavieh et al 2018 as recommended by allen et al 2007a as a minor modification a simple snow melting process was incorporated in the soil water balance model assuming that precipitation on days when air temperature is below zero is snow haddeland et al 2011 harder and pomeroy 2014 the computational results of the soil water balance model are shown in fig 4 3 determination of surface roughness length the roughness estimation equation in metric is best for bare soil to short crop surfaces the equation was applied to all surfaces except for the city and tree cover orchard in this study the city and tree covered areas were identified from satellite images and roughness was separately assigned 4 limitations of δt in sensible heat estimation in metric sensible heat is estimated using eq 3 wherein δt is determined using two calibration points cold and hot pixels the estimations of δt and sensible heat are stabilized if the surface conditions lie in between the cold and hot pixel conditions however in some pixels with extreme surface conditions unrealistically high or low sensible heat might be computed by the model to address this issue the maximum and minimum limits for the δt estimation procedure were set to prevent extreme unrealistic δt values in terms of availability of surface energy 5 evaporation from snow surfaces accurate estimation of evaporation from snow surfaces is difficult using metric because the snow covered condition violates some important assumptions adopted in metric such as that used to estimate δt and metric disregards latent heat of melting in the energy balance computations as the evaporation from snow surface is expected to be small on average kojima 1984 kojima et al 1985 it was approximated as zero in this study in addition to the above listed refinements the following two items were investigated during the study the solutions are described and discussed in the results section 6 evaporation from the lake the metric model is not applicable to estimating lake evaporation without local calibration allen et al 2007a the estimation of evaporation from a lake surface is difficult because solar radiation penetrates water water bodies have large heat capacities and the advection of heat can easily occur with water flow in this study the empirical evaporation estimation method for urmia lake is investigated through literature reviews 7 evapotranspiration from city areas preliminary et estimation results indicated a large amount of et from city areas in the fall season however field surveys indicated that the large et in city areas in the fall was overestimated in this study the reasons for the overestimation are investigated and the solution is suggested 2 4 accuracy assessment validation is one of the most challenging problems in satellite based et estimation researches li et al 2009 because of factors such as advection the ground measured et itself can have more than 20 measured by eddy covariance or up to 29 measured by eddy covariance error moreover ground measured et typically does not represent et from the area of satellite image pixel therefore large uncertainties in validation is typically inevitable even if ground measured et data is available while no actual ground measured et data were available in the study area this study attempts to assess the et estimation accuracy via comparisons with et estimated using the fao 56 allen et al 1998 which was proposed by stancalie et al 2010 in their work fao 56 is a widely accepted method for field et estimation pereira et al 2015 however fao 56 can only estimate et for adequately watered healthy cropping fields unless detailed data i e quantity and timing of precipitation and irrigation of the water application in the target field is available in addition the comparison must be made in large homogeneous fields more than 200 m by 200 m i e twice the thermal resolution of landsat 8 unfortunately the typical field size in the urmia irrigation area is less than 50 m by 50 m and several different types of crops are cultivated based on the field survey some apples and one grape field were the only irrigated crops where a large extent of homogeneous cultivation areas could be found in the study area some non irrigated bare soil surfaces located near the weather station were another possible locations to estimate et by fao 56 for such bare soil surface the quantity and the timing of water application can be assigned as the precipitation data recorded by the weather station which enable fao 56 to estimate et the actual quantity and the timing of precipitation can deviate from the weather data if the location of bare soil is far from the weather station in this study large bare soil surfaces located within around 15 km from the weather station were selected upon field et estimation using fao 56 a single crop coefficient kc approach was adopted kc values and lengths of crop development stages were provided in the literature fao 56 estimates et only from a specific beginning date typically in spring to a specific end date typically in the fall of cultivation to account for inevitable et from fields during the remainder of the year typically in winter the kc of the initial development stage was assigned for apples and kc estimated by the soil water balance model was assigned for grapes during the period this follows from the common practice among farmers in the urmia region rain fed wheat is also a primary crop in the study area that has a significant share in the cultivation area however wheat was omitted from comparison for the accuracy assessment because fao 56 cannot estimate actual et for the rain fed wheat only with the information available in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 local refinements 3 1 1 evaporation from urmia lake table 2 summarizes annual lake evaporation and air temperature data obtained from the literature some of the numbers in the table were obtained from graphs in the source materials temperature data comprise air temperatures either at water surfaces or at nearby weather stations fig 5 illustrates the plot of data presented in table 2 in cases where the climate conditions were not excessively different the annual amount of lake evaporation tended to be linear relative to the annual air temperature croley ii et al 1998 kondo 2000 tasumi 2005 because higher air temperature causes the lake to use more energy in evaporation and less energy in sensible heat kondo 2000 according to raoult s law evaporation from salt water becomes less than evaporation from fresh water if other weather and energy conditions are constant however evaporation from saline lakes tends to be greater than that from fresh water lakes in fig 5 this could be attributed to the fact that saline lakes tend to be located in arid and semi arid regions that promote evaporation because of low humidity the two sources for the dead sea reported annual evaporation values that were different by 300 mm yr 1 which might indicate the difficulty and uncertainty in lake evaporation observation and estimation evaporation reported by dead sea 1 is equivalent to evaporation from other saline lakes located in much colder regions which might be an indication of underestimation because temperature is an important factor that controls annual evaporation evaporation from urmia lake has been reported as 1171 mm yr 1 jalili et al 2012 which was derived from a class a pan observation installed near the lake and filled with lake saline water however evaporation from a class a pan installed near a lake is known to be greater than evaporation from the lake surface owing to differences in humidity conditions leading to differences on the order of for example 20 40 jensen et al 2016 thus the reported 1171 mm yr 1 might be an overestimation considering the theoretical relationship between temperature and evaporation with empirical linearity reported for fresh water lakes and uncertainties available in literature information this study suggest eq 5 to estimate evaporation from urmia lake the equation expresses the solid line shown in fig 5 which was drawn by connecting evaporation from great salt lake and the dead sea 2 assuming these two literature values are relatively reliable the annual average temperature of urmia varies from 10 7 c to 13 1 c during 2007 2016 and the eq 5 is used only for the short temperature range 5 eannual 34 x tair annual 660 where eannual is annual evaporation from urmia lake mm yr 1 and tair annual is annual air temperature c at the weather station near the lake the equation suggests about 10 lower evaporation from urmia lake compared to the value reported by jalili et al 2012 which might explain the difference between pan evaporation and lake evaporation relative to fresh water lakes eq 5 suggests higher evaporation especially in cold temperature regions this is possible because saline lakes have lower freezing points and shorter ice cover periods in winter in cold regions than fresh water lakes which promotes evaporation compared to fresh water lakes a sensitivity analysis for qinghai lake in china indicated that the annual water surface evaporation increases by 16 saline content 187 5 g l 1 when compared to fresh water lakes because of the impact of reduction in the freezing point momoki 1994 while the annual evaporation largely depends on the air temperature monthly trends in lake evaporation are largely affected by the lake depth tasumi 2005 shallow lakes such as urmia lake are expected to have monthly evaporation trends similar to pan evaporation or reference et tasumi 2005 accepting this assumption the estimated annual evaporation suggested in eq 5 is distributed to each month according to the distribution ratio determined by the long term average month to year ratio of etr in the urmia lake table 3 3 1 2 evapotranspiration from city areas the overestimation of et in city areas especially in the fall season was caused by the cold estimated surface temperature at city areas to empirically overcome this problem two types of corrections were made for city areas the first correction was to improve thermal emissivity metric estimates thermal emissivity using a leaf area index that assumes natural and agricultural surfaces rather than cities thus the minimum emissivity for the landsat thermal band was set as 0 97 however commercial areas can have much lower emissivity compared to natural type surfaces roberts et al 2012 which causes the underestimation of surface temperature in city areas in this study based on the analysis of spectral emissivity data by roberts et al 2012 0 93 was assigned for emissivity in densely built city areas the second correction was made to reduce the impact of shadows on et estimation in city areas field surveys indicated that building shadows cause erroneously cold temperature readings in city areas in the fall the problem is due to the difference in direction between sunlight and satellite observation the city temperature would be observed as much higher if measured from the same direction as the sunlight however as satellite observation is conducted from the nadir angle the satellite sees a large portion of shadows cast by buildings the shadowed area is largest in winter when the sun angle is lowest at the satellite overpass time however the impact of shadows on et estimation is largest during fall in urmia because the surfaces are dry in the fall the impact of shadows on et estimation is not obvious in wet seasons because the surface temperatures of shadowed and sunny surfaces do not differ significantly this problem was empirically solved by artificially increasing the surface temperature in city areas by 1 0 4 7 c the ratio of the increment was determined by analyzing the shadow covered area for each satellite image for a typical size and density of buildings in urmia city fig 6 and analyzing the expected temperature difference between shadowed and non shadowed areas 3 2 accuracy assessment et for the satellite image acquisition dates were computed through metric model processing applied with local refinements the monthly and annual et were estimated by interpolating etrf values in between two satellite image dates the estimation results were further evaluated for some sample locations by comparing with independently estimated et following the fao 56 manual allen et al 1998 seven locations were selected for accuracy assessment and another eight locations were selected for additional discussion table 4 fig 7 shows the estimated monthly and annual et maps with the locations selected for accuracy assessment august is a dry season and thus et was small in natural conditions such as rangeland while a large amount of et was estimated in irrigated areas 3 2 1 accuracy assessment for satellite image acquisition dates fig 8 shows the comparison between fao 56 and metric estimated et hereafter etfao56 and etmetric for the satellite image acquisition dates during 2014 2016 etfao56 for location 4 could not be estimated for 2014 2015 because the field was not well managed during the period assuming that the difference between etfao56 and etmetric is the estimation error of metric mean bias error mbe for apple grape and bare soils were 0 20 0 16 and 0 36 mm d 1 respectively where the positive number indicates over estimation the mean absolute error mae were 0 57 0 72 and 0 59 mm d 1 respectively root mean square error rmse were 0 73 0 84 and 0 68 mm d 1 respectively the estimation accuracy obtained in this study for the satellite image acquisition dates was similar to a metric application for well managed almond field in california mbe ranges from 0 32 to 0 37 rmse ranges from 0 49 to 0 93 mm d 1 he et al 2017 and better than for salinity affected pistachio field mbe 0 5 rmse 1 4 mm d 1 jin et al 2018 while the average et widely varies from bare soil 0 41 mm d 1 to apple 5 29 mm d 1 mbe mae and rmse tended to be similar among the three different landuse types indicating that the error range in metric tends to be constant not proportional to the amount of et occurring the estimation accuracy was high in wet i e apple conditions intermediate in moderate i e grape conditions and low in dry i e bare soil conditions if the error is expressed in percentage of actual et rmse 0 73 mm d 1 for apple is equivalent to 14 of the average et and it is better than typical uncertainty of et observation by eddy covariance 20 wilson et al 2002 li et al 2009 in contrast rmse 0 68 mm d 1 for bare soil is equivalent to 166 of the average et for bare soil it should be noted that accurately estimating tiny et from dry surface was difficult in this metric application 3 2 2 accuracy assessment for monthly and annual timescale fig 9 shows the monthly estimated etmetric and etfao56 values for apple grape and bare soil mbe lied between 0 1 to 8 3 mm mo 1 mae was between 9 0 to 16 0 mm mo 1 rmse was between 10 8 to 20 5 mm mo 1 etmetric for the three apple fields representing wet agricultural conditions was in good agreement to etfao56 throughout a year except some early spring months a part of the error in early spring may have been caused by less frequent satellite observations given that march is a cloudy season table 1 another possible reason is that the actual difference of et from individual field that is not reflected in etfao56 in this study accounts for the error in etmetric although farmers in the study area occasionally irrigate apple fields even during winter for pest management regular irrigation typically starts from april or may depending on the area and the individual farmers thus larger variations in soil water content caused by difference in field management by farmers are expected between march to april which is not accounted for in etfao56 values for bare soil surfaces etmetric was overestimated in the dry season in summer the selected bare soil fields received almost no rain from july to september during 2014 2016 and evaporation is expected to be very small only over estimation can occur in such conditions because there is no room to underestimate et moreover etr is high in summer because of the rich solar radiation as shown in eq 4 a small error in etrf estimated by metric can be magnified in terms of the et for the period when etr is high in annual integrated et fig 10 mbe for applies is 2 67 mm yr 1 61 mm yr 1 for grape and 29 99 mm yr 1 for bare soils the samples of irrigated agriculture had mbe equivalent to less than 10 of et which is regarded as accurate in the context of agricultural water management according to farmers the typical amount of irrigation for apple plantation in the area is about 1800 mm yr 1 this study shows that about 60 of water entering the field sum of precipitation and irrigation is consumed as et on the other hand etmetric must be used cautiously to bare soils and rangeland although mbe 29 99 mm yr 1 might be an acceptable range of error in surface energy balance it is not negligible if compared to the precipitation long term average is 294 mm yr 1 some uncertainties are inevitable in this accuracy assessment approach however similar uncertainties might be inevitable even if ground measured et data are available fig 11 shows the metric estimated results for location numbers 8 to 15 in table 4 the estimated annual et values from three rain fed wheat fields are distributed from 316 to 652 mm yr 1 according to fao 56 an adequately watered wheat field in this area requires approximately 670 mm yr 1 of et including the inevitable et during non cultivation season thus the most rain fed wheat in this area should have been water stressed which is in agreement with actual conditions confirmed by the field surveys the water stress condition can also be confirmed via the ndvi from satellite observations fig 12 shows the ndvi and etmetric of the satellite images for the three rain fed wheat fields note that dotted lines in the etmetric graphs are to visually aid the reader they do not represent the way of interpolation of et in between the satellite image strong peak ndvi implying favorable growing of the wheat were recognized only for years 2014 and 2015 in location 9 and year 2015 in location 10 etmetric for these three cases were 652 605 and 470 mm yr 1 where the etmetric for the two favorable growing years in location 9 were close to the reference value by fao 56 for healthy wheat in fig 12 location year having low ndvi tend to show low et indicating that metric sees the water stress condition via the estimated amount of et the estimated et from irrigated short crops loc 11 13 fig 11 is difficult to evaluate or discuss because of the small field size and the complex crop types and timings each of the data shown as loc 11 13 contains several different types of short crops with some minor horticulture and residential areas at the least estimated et for irrigated short crops lies in the range between irrigated apple and rain fed wheat which is an expected range of et for this landuse type annual et from densely built city centers was estimated as 136 to 192 mm if the annual precipitation at urmia station is representative of the city areas in case of 2016 192 mm out of 321 mm is used in et and the rest 129 mm is drained the discussion for urmia lake surface evaporation was already presented in the previous section as a limitation of accuracy assessment no evaluation was attempted for mountainous regions near the border of the basin owing to a lack of information about evapotranspiration there 4 conclusion this study estimated the et from the western part of the urmia lake basin to provide quality information on spatio temporal et in the basin with landsat resolution monthly et was estimated for a period of three years from 2014 to 2016 by applying the metric model with several local refinements the estimation accuracies were evaluated using independently estimated et by fao 56 method for irrigated apple and grape fields and for non irrigated bare soil land the rmse was 0 68 0 84 mm d 1 for the satellite image acquisition dates and 10 8 20 5 mm d 1 for monthly estimations the estimation accuracy was comparable to other similar applications the error range in metric tended to be constant for a wide variety of et amount and it derived high relative accuracy for wet apple fields and low relative accuracy for dry bare soil surfaces the study area also experienced limited precipitation during july to september and evaporation was minimal in non irrigated bare soils in such situations only over estimation can occur because there is no room to underestimate et thus the derived values of 29 99 mm yr 1 tend to be overestimations in bare soil and the amount is not negligible when compared to the annual precipitation 294 mm estimated et for rain fed wheat fields was in good agreement with the evapotranspirative requirement of healthy wheat for the well growing fields while et was lower for the fields having weak crops this was indicative of the fact that the metric model captures the water stress condition of the crops via et although there are uncertainties in terms of the accuracy assessment of this approach the comparison results indicate successful estimation of et in this region this work provides the first evapotranspiration data for this basin with this spatio temporal resolution and accuracy information therefore the estimation procedure and its results are expected to contribute to a better understanding of regional hydrology this is necessary both for restoration of urmia lake and for achieving sustainable water management in the region declaration of competing

increasing crop water use efficiency can be approached by two strategies including an enhancement in the adaptive aptitude of crops to increase the quantity of transpired water and raise the crop s

requirement since 85 of total available water is consumed by agriculture and most of the on farm irrigation systems have low efficiency in addition to poor irrigation management recently increasing

application of si chi under severe drought stress 3 3 anatomical characters cross section of wheat flag leaf in selected treatment in the second season control severe drought chi si under well watered or severe drought showed that there is an obvious modification in leaf anatomical characteristics table 4 and fig 2 generally severe drought has a depressing effect on the leaf blade thickness main vascular bundle dimensions big metaxylem vessel diameter and the thickness of the midrib region the chi si application have an enhancement effect on the thickness of the wheat flag leaf compared with untreated control plants moreover the thickness of the leaf blade through the midrib region was conjointly raised owing to the rise in the midrib vascular bundle dimension also the chi si treatment increased the diameter of the big metaxylem vessel application of chi si under severe drought helped in mitigating the destructive injuries on leaf anatomical characters relative to severe drought affected plants only table 4 fig 2 regarding the stem anatomy table 4 and fig 3 revealed that severe drought significantly decreased all anatomical features of wheat stem i e stem diameter thickness of ground tissue vascular bundle number and big metaxylem vessel diameter compared with control foliar application of chi si has a positive impact and achieved increments in most of all stem anatomical features additionally foliar application of chi si under severe drought alleviated the harmful impact on anatomical characteristics 3 4 mesophyll ultrastructure transmission electron study of selected treatments in the second season control severe drought chi si under well watered or severe drought showed typical wheat mesophylls cell organelles like chloroplasts nucleolus and mitochondria chloroplasts are ellipses that contain well arranged granum and smooth thylakoid membranes they exhibited a typical mitochondrion structure with well displayed mitochondrion membranes organized in outer and inner membranes additionally transparent nuclei are apparent along with the well developed nuclear envelope fig 4 severe drought induced a noticeable ultrastructural alteration of cell organelles fig 4c g and k regarding well watered plants the chloroplasts with starch grain clung to the cell walls the chloroplasts were irregular in shape and asymmetrically swelling and clumped along typically forming aggregation fig 4c the chloroplast envelop was moderately ruptured and the thylakoid membranes were loose and disrupted while the thylakoid was overall disorganized the mitochondria were elongated and displayed an ellipse shape the outer membrane plugged and got unclear in some area where the cristae also obscured and curled the ubiquitous presence of mitochondria with the transparent matrix and very few cristae was also documented the cell nucleus distorted the outer membrane got damaged and even disappeared in some area fig 4g arrow application of chi si under well watered had an encouraging impact on organelles ultrastructure fig 4b f j compared with untreated control plants the chloroplasts were mainly elongated they possessed clearly defined envelope membranes well developed internal membrane systems composed of grana and long stromal thylakoids align with a kidney shaped starch grain fig 4b grana were distributed in a regular manner throughout the sectioned areas of chloroplasts and granal thylakoid was well developed and packed closely together mitochondria were principally oval elongated shape with electron dense matrix and clearly visible cristae fig 4j with well displayed mitochondrion membrane transparent nuclei were apparent along with well developed nuclear membrane fig 4f foliar application of chi si under severe drought fig 4d h l showed an ameliorative effect relative to the untreated stressed plants the chloroplasts shape modified faintly to ellipse close to the cell wall well aligned internal lamellar system ultrastructural changes in mitochondria were inconspicuous the most obvious observation in chloroplasts that appears more plastoglobule as compared with well watered or severe drought its number and size were increased markedly cell nuclei were clear and noticeable along with undamaged and remarkably nuclear membrane nuclear scaffold and nucleolus 3 5 yield and its components data presented in tables 5 and 6 clearly indicate that wheat yield and its components drastically declined with drought stress the great reduction for number of grain spike 21 and 19 grain weight spike 25 and 19 grain index 25 and 27 grain yield 32 and 32 straw yield 30 and 28 biological yield 16 and 31 as well as grain carbohydrates 12 and 13 and protein 19 and 16 in the first and second season respectively were recorded under severe drought relative to well watered plants foliar application with si and or chi significantly increased all yield and its components than the untreated plants the most effective treatment in this regard was si chi that increased number of grain spike 25 and 36 grain weight spike 22 and 27 grain index 35 and 34 grain yield 74 and 64 straw yield 49 and 41 biological yield 55 and 49 as well as grain carbohydrates 12 and 16 and protein 24 and 40 in the first and second season respectively relative to untreated control plants tables 5 and 6 foliar application of si and or chi nullifies the drastic injury of drought stress on wheat crop yield since application of si chi under severe drought increased the number of grain spike 58 and 46 grain weight spike 60 and 66 grain index 29 and 21 grain yield 67 and 44 straw yield 75 and 31 biological yield 18 and 50 as well as grain carbohydrates 14 and 24 and protein 32 and 45 in the first and second season respectively relative to untreated drought affected plants 3 6 water use efficiency wue data presented in table 6 proved that increasing drought stress significantly increased wue compared with well watered plants in the first season the highest wue 33 was obtained under mild drought compared with well watered plants meanwhile in the second seasons severe drought increased wue by 34 and 11 than well watered and mild drought respectively wue significantly increased by application of si and or chi above well watered plants where the maximum wue was obtained by application of si chi that increased it by 79 in the first season and by 59 in the second season table 6 the data in the same table clearly showed that application of si and or chi under moderate or severe drought improved wue relative to untreated well watered plants the highest wue 119 and 89 in the first and second season was obtained by application of si chi under moderate or severe drought stress respectively 4 discussion drought severely decreased plant development and productivity as reported previously farouk et al 2018 alghory and yazar 2019 sheshbahreh et al 2019 low abundant of water in the root zone may lead to shrinking in vascular tissue and reduced water absorption banon et al 2006 furthermore drought hinders the nutrient uptake and induces the ros production that evokes oxidative injury and consequently a decrease in plant growth farouk et al 2018 garcía caparrós et al 2019 current observation has established that either chi and or si supplementation under well watered or drought conditions exhibit extraordinary impacts on plant growth as compared with a well watered or untreated plant under such drought levels numerous possible mechanisms coupled with stress mitigation by chi and or si in higher plants have been recognized 1 improvement of water status that reflected to increase rwc and ion concentration as presented in the current investigation farouk et al 2018 safoora et al 2018 sheshbahreh et al 2019 2 increased the initiation of leaf primordial and declined plastochron duration that directs to increase leaf area and finally plant biomass alzahrani et al 2018 in the mid 80 s rwc was introduced as a good criterion for plant water status under water deficit maintaining rwc in plant cells at an excellent status confers the metabolic activity to be sustained by osmotic adjustment here a decline in rwc under drought has been noted previously farouk et al 2018 alghory and yazar 2019 garcía caparrós et al 2019 the rwc of chi and or si treated plants under well watered or water deficit was maintained at higher levels to an excellent level corresponding to stressed plants devoid of chi and or si application prompt that chi and or si will improve wheat water relation throughout the water deficit the improved ability to preserve water in plants treated with si might be caused by formation of silica cuticle double layer on leaf epidermis that composes an obstacle to water transpiration karmollachaab and gharineh 2015 moreover application of either chi or si stimulated the development and elongation of the root system and strengthens the capacity of water absorption as well as up regulation of aquaporin genes so as to enhance water retention and improved wue liu et al 2018 furthermore drought evokes hyper accumulation of ros that accelerates peroxidation of membrane lipids and consequently increases membrane permeability alzahrani et al 2018 farouk et al 2018 such damage can be caused by oxidation and cross linkage of protein thiols and inhibition of key membrane proteins as h atpase gong et al 2005 si and or chi supplementation to plants grown under well watered or stress condition lowered the values of plasma membrane permeability farouk et al 2017 alzahrani et al 2018 safoora et al 2018 this indicates that the application of chi and or si might sustain the stabilities of membranes in environmental stressed wheat plants severe drought altered photosynthetic pigment components and damaged the photosynthetic apparatus as indicated previously the decreases in photosynthetic pigment concentration under drought may be due to 1 inhibition of the biosynthesis of the chlorophyll pigment complexes encoded by the cab gene family prakash and ramachandran 2000 2 damage of chiral macro aggregates of the light harvesting pigment protein complexes that provide a protection to chloroplasts lai et al 2007 3 and or the loss of chloroplast membranes extreme swelling alteration of the lamellae vesiculation and the appearance of lipid droplets fig 3 the drastically increase in photosynthetic pigment concentration by chi and or si supplementation are in accordance with those of ghasemi pirbalouti et al 2017 safoora et al 2018 farouk and al sanoussi 2019 these increases may be attributed to well organized ros scavenging systems that will have otherwise damaged the chlorophyll by antioxidant enzymes and solutes farouk et al 2017 the carotenoids present functions as a light receptor and photo system shielded against ros which it has the capability to accumulate carotenoid accordingly the application of si lobato et al 2009 or chi farouk et al 2017 accelerates the over accumulation of carotenoids in photosynthetic tissues a widespread reaction of plants to water deficit is excess accumulation of various compatible organic and antioxidant solutes that are of small molecular weight extremely soluble and typically safe at high cellular concentrations without interfering with biochemical reactions pro is the most signalling molecule that influence cell proliferation and trigger specific gene expression which might be necessary for plant survival under drought farouk et al 2018 or si merwad et al 2018 safoora et al 2018 and chi ghasemi pirbalouti et al 2017 however pro metabolism in the presence of chi or si is not completely identified and need additional studies many authors showed that the importance of tsc in inducing pro accumulation through inhibition of the degradation enzymes and stimulated the pro synthesis enzymes accordingly hare and cress 1996 noticed that mrna transcript encoding p5cr was magnified in phloem tissue under drought the quantity of tsc was progressively rising in plants under drought or foliar application of either chi and or si relative to control plants the current investigation outcomes in accordance with farouk et al 2018 for drought alzahrani et al 2018 safoora et al 2018 for si bistgani et al 2017 for chi the tsc are widely accepted as an osmoprotectant that regulates the osmotic adjustment provide membrane protection and scavenge toxic ros against numerous stresses koyro et al 2012 normally plants constantly generate numerous ros throughout photosynthesis and respiration processes thus plants will sustain equilibrium by two diverse detoxification strategies involving enzymatic and non enzymatic antioxidants hidangmayum et al 2019 their concentrations magnified significantly in plant tissues under drought as well as chi and or si application farouk et al 2017 2018 compared with untreated control plants the asa is a critical hydrophilic non enzymatic antioxidant molecule that regulates the oxidation reduction system and protects them against stress smirnoff 2018 the present investigation postulated that elevated accretion of asa took place in the plant tissue under drought stress moreover foliar application of si and or chi additionally elicited this accumulation these results counsel that si and or chi are implicated in regulating antioxidant defense and so counteracted oxidative injure in water deficit affected plants since leaves are the major organs of internal water removal si and or chi treated plants under well watered or drought conditions undertaken leaf anatomical modifications to save water in fact wheat flag leaf treated with either si and or chi showed a thicker leaf blade and mesophyll than water treated plants under severe drought stress a thicker chlorenchyma could improve survival and growth under drought by enhancing plant cell water status in this concern el afry et al 2012 on wheat found that drought stress decreased the thickness of epidermis phloem tissue mesophyll tissue vascular bundles dimension additionally farouk et al 2017 merwad et al 2018 proved that chi application improved all anatomical characteristics of grapevine and cowpea respectively relative to untreated plants the extreme influence of drought on the stem and leaf anatomy of wheat plants may result from the decrease in net photosynthetic rates that decline or prevent water loss and decreases co2 availability for chloroplasts bertamini et al 2007 furthermore this effect could also be ascribed to the outcome of the enormous and irreversible expansion of small daughter cells produced by meristematic divisions and growth inhibition is thus associated with the inhibition of cell expansion in addition to reduced rates of new cell production may make an extra contribution to the inhibition of growth exploratory the ultrastructural alterations in plant cells under water deficit may be a convenient and valuable means for unveiling the essential strategies occupied in conferring drought tolerance cell organelles react quickly to environmental stress with a series of adaptation and avoidance strategies velikova et al 2009 farouk et al 2017 2018 severe drought deficit induced damages of the chloroplasts include excessive swelling of the external chloroplast membrane distortion of the stroma and interregnal lamellar system the collapse of organelle structure inhibiting photosynthesis and accumulation of lipid droplets in the chloroplasts numerous investigations have been postulated the existence of outsized and extra copious plastoglobules in chloroplasts from different plants grown under various environmental stresses farouk et al 2017 2018 the mechanism and the function of this modulation of plastoglobule size and number in relevance to stress don t seem to be nonetheless understood some investigations have established that the raised plastoglobules number under stress circumstances is associated with the elevated levels of plastoglobule specific proteins as well as increased production of small antioxidant molecules austin et al 2006 proteomic and ultrastructural studies of plastoglobules confirmed their essential roles in protecting thylakoid membranes from oxidative damage to the photosynthetic apparatus austin et al 2006 under normal conditions the mitochondria had a comparable size and appearance alternatively the drought affected plants had swollen mitochondria and a loss in the integrity of the external mitochondrial membrane cristae and huge electron transparent areas in the matrix comparable results have been documented on populus by wang et al 2015 the higher mitochondrial number meets the increased demand for atp under adverse circumstances once photosynthesis is greatly suppressed silva et al 2010 furthermore these organelles respond to stress by the synthesis of various specific mitochondrial stress proteins rizhsky et al 2004 in distinction to chloroplasts ultrastructural observations of mitochondria showed that these organelles were heavily influenced by stress however they still preserve their respiratory efficiency at extreme conditions vassileva et al 2009 water scarcity is a common stress feature that always reduces crop yield up to 50 relative to well watered plants farouk et al 2018 alghory and yazar 2019 this reduction may be resulted from reducing tiller number and flag leaf area table 2 resulting in less biomass production and hinder translocation of photoassimilate towards the developing fruits and or inducing flower and fruit abortion liu et al 2014 also song et al 1998 documented that drought evoked pollen swollen and filament development diminished filament fertility and resulted in declines in grain yield the increment in wheat yield attributable to si and or chi may result from their effects on inducing metabolic processes and anatomical alteration farouk et al 2017 behboudi et al 2018 merwad et al 2018 the yield enhancement by si corresponded to the preservation of higher net photosynthesis rate and improving the source sink relationship accordingly liang et al 2013 verified that si application accelerates lodging resistance by strengthening the stem base as well as leaves become additional erect therefore reducing self shading and increased photosynthesis capacity particularly during the grain filling period that connected with starch buildup in grains additionally si may be deposition under the leaf epidermis which may result in a physical mechanism of defense leading to decreases transpiration and increased photosynthetic capacity korndörfer et al 2004 obviously drought declined the protein and carbohydrate percentage in wheat grain these results are in harmony with those obtained by mahdy and teama 2000 hasanpour et al 2012 behboudi et al 2018 such impact might be caused by the decrease of co2 fixation a reduction of assimilates translocation and a decline in the expression of starch and protein synthesis genes younis et al 2000 it is clearly shown that grain protein percentage was decreased by drought however increased with the chi and or si application carbohydrate represented one of the main constituents of grain composition that markedly decreased under drought such effect could result from the decline in the photosynthetic rate that disrupts carbohydrate metabolism and might lead to the reduction in assimilating transported to sink organs thereby increasing the reproduction abortion as well as a reduction in expression of starch synthesis genes westgate 1994 on the other hand the increment in carbohydrate percentage of chi and or si pretreatment might be attributed to the increment of photosynthetic pigment leading to enhancement of carbohydrate synthesis and accumulation water stress drastically improved wue in both experimental seasons corresponding to well watered plants comparable outcome have been recorded by sheshbahreh et al 2019 on the other hand chi and or si under well watered or drought treatment increased wue this increases may be due to its effects on photosynthetic pigment biosynthesis and photosynthesis processes osmotic adjustment and antioxidant capacity which leads to increasing leaf area root growth and thus rising the water and nutrient absorption as indicated in the present investigation and other early reports safoora et al 2018 5 conclusion foliar applied chitosan and or silicon enhanced the accumulation of osmolytes and improved the entire anatomical characteristics of leaf and stem as well as maintained the microorganells ultrastructure in special chloroplasts that abled the wheat crops to protract the biological membranes under water scarcity resulting in better stay green under drought which eventually improved the plant growth increased grain yield and water use efficiency on conclusion spraying drought affected wheat plants with 125 mg l 1 sodium metasilicate plus 250 mg l 1 chitosan twice at 50 and 70 days from sowing could be a promising practice for alleviating the drought effects hence improves water use efficiency as well as enhancing crop yield and its quality funding this research neither received any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial nor for profitable sectors declaration of competing interest there is no conflict of interest 
10847,water scarcity is considered as a key restriction for food production worldwide chitosan chi and silicon si play a crucial role in plants metabolic processes under normal or stress conditions field experiments were done at the res station nat res cen el nubaria province egypt in 2014 15 and 2015 16 seasons in a split plot based on randomized complete block design with three replications for assessing the defensive role of chi and or si on wheat growth yield some physio anatomical attributes and water use efficiency under different irrigation regimes the experimental treatments included three irrigation water regimes 100 70 and 40 of drip irrigation water requirement iwr as the main factor as well as chi and or si water 125 mg l 1 si 250 mg l 1 chi and 125 mg l 1 si 250 mg l 1 chi as the sub factor water deficit significantly decreases plant growth yield photosynthetic pigment and relative water content whereas significantly induced noticeable changes in leaf and stem anatomy as well as organelle s ultrastructure application of chi si gave the highest plant growth and yield attributes maintaining plant water status along with improved physiological trials under irrigation regimes additionally the application of chi si under severe drought showed an ameliorative effect on cell ultrastructure compared with drought affected plants only including well developed chloroplasts increased plastoglobules and maintained nucleus and mitochondria structure overall this investigation proposes that the application of 125 mg l 1 si plus 250 mg l 1 chi twice at 50 and 70 days from sowing had potential to mitigate the water deficit effects improving water use efficiency as well as increasing the wheat yield and its quality keywords chitosan drought silicon triticum aestivum l ultrastructure yield 1 introduction wheat triticum aestivum l poaceae is counted among the big three cereals with over 600 million tones being harvested annually faostat 2017 it s the key source of staple food for the inhabitants so continual studies are done for raising its yield to fulfill imperative demands of increasing worldwide population that s expected to achieve six billion by 2050 schiermeier 2008 the agricultural production and water safety in the mediterranean countries are facing numerous environmental challenges including climate change water scarcity insufficient infrastructure lack of financial resources rapid population growth and urbanization faostat 2017 drought is considered the main restrictive factors in agricultural production along with the diverse environmental constraints that affect nearly 40 60 of the global agricultural land shahryari and mollasadeghi 2011 water deficit was certainly declined wheat yield by 17 70 owing to their extreme effects on morphological and physio anatomical modifications farouk et al 2018 sheshbahreh et al 2019 it alters various metabolic processes including photosynthesis water absorption and plasma membrane integrity leading to growth and yield decline merwad et al 2018 sheshbahreh et al 2019 under drought crops occupy a serious of defensive strategies like maintaining water status activation of antioxidant machinery and rapid accumulation of organic solutes for improving tolerance ability and avoid extreme loss of water farouk et al 2018 alghory and yazar 2019 in arid and semi arid regions increasing crop water use efficiency can be approached by two strategies including an enhancement in the adaptive aptitude of crops to increase the quantity of transpired water and raise the crop s efficiency to produce biomass and yield per unit of transpired water in egypt agricultural extension desires a massive quantity of irrigation water that s already not enough to satisfy the predictable requirement since 85 of total available water is consumed by agriculture and most of the on farm irrigation systems have low efficiency in addition to poor irrigation management recently increasing competition for insufficient water resources has promoted the cost effective innovated approach for maximizing water use efficiency and increasing crop yield application of antitranspirant has been one of the realistic strategies in this regard farouk et al 2018 merwad et al 2018 out of various antitranspirants used chitosan chi and or silicon metasilicate si is used to regulate crop development and productivity under well watered or water deficit circumstances these materials are inexpensive accessible easy to use and environmentally friendly and provide both economic and ecological efficacy recently chi has attracted extraordinary deliberation as potentially vital biological resources hidangmayum et al 2019 numerous investigators have accepted that chi supplementation enhanced growth and productivity as well as improved the physiological and anatomical processes of many crops under non stressed or stress conditions helaly et al 2018 souza et al 2018 farouk and al sanoussi 2019 additionally chi was found to reduce pepper plant transpiration leading to a 26 43 decline in water use whereas raising growth and productivity bittelli et al 2001 generally si is commonly recognized to be a valuable nutrient for crop development and productivity under normal or stressful environment merwad et al 2018 farouk and al sanoussi 2019 numerous effects of si on crops are reported it is introduced as a pivotal physio mechanical barrier in most plants accelerating enzymatic activity kim et al 2017 regulates gene expression merwad et al 2018 additionally si application enhances the leaf water potential transpiration rate and photosynthesis under stressful environment luyckx et al 2017 moreover it is extremely related to osmotic adjustment and inhibition of reactive oxygen species ros accumulation as well as maintaining the permeability of cell membranes enhanced photosynthesis improved leaf organelles ultrastructure and finally stimulation of antioxidant system farouk et al 2017 kim et al 2017 exogenous application of chi and or si has been accepted to have a positive effect on drought tolerance in various plant species despite known positive effects of chi or si individually whether they have additive or synergistic effects on alleviating drought injuries is unclear and not investigated therefore the objective of this study was to determine whether the application of chi alone or synergistically interacting with si would suppress drought injuries in wheat crop this work was planned to improve understanding the defensive role of chi and or si application on wheat plant growth some anatomical and physiological parameters water use efficiency and yield under well watered and water deficit stress conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 site

asa 37 and 30 and tsc 46 and 34 were obtained by application of si chi however application of si and or chi significantly decreased pro and tsp table 3 regarding the interaction effect foliar application with si and or chi under moderate drought significantly increased rwc relative to untreated well watered plants alternatively application of si chi nullifies the harmful effect of severe drought on flag leaf rwc relative to untreated severe drought affected plants in both growing seasons table 3 additionally the application of si and or chi under moderate or severe drought significantly increased pro and tsp concentration relative to untreated well watered plants table 3 on the other hand the highest asa 129 and 85 and tsc 246 and 174 concentration were obtained by application of si chi under severe drought stress 3 3 anatomical characters cross section of wheat flag leaf in selected treatment in the second season control severe drought chi si under well watered or severe drought showed that there is an obvious modification in leaf anatomical characteristics table 4 and fig 2 generally severe drought has a depressing effect on the leaf blade thickness main vascular bundle dimensions big metaxylem vessel diameter and the thickness of the midrib region the chi si application have an enhancement effect on the thickness of the wheat flag leaf compared with untreated control plants moreover the thickness of the leaf blade through the midrib region was conjointly raised owing to the rise in the midrib vascular bundle dimension also the chi si treatment increased the diameter of the big metaxylem vessel application of chi si under severe drought helped in mitigating the destructive injuries on leaf anatomical characters relative to severe drought affected plants only table 4 fig 2 regarding the stem anatomy table 4 and fig 3 revealed that severe drought significantly decreased all anatomical features of wheat stem i e stem diameter thickness of ground tissue vascular bundle number and big metaxylem vessel diameter compared with control foliar application of chi si has a positive impact and achieved increments in most of all stem anatomical features additionally foliar application of chi si under severe drought alleviated the harmful impact on anatomical characteristics 3 4 mesophyll ultrastructure transmission electron study of selected treatments in the second season control severe drought chi si under well watered or severe drought showed typical wheat mesophylls cell organelles like chloroplasts nucleolus and mitochondria chloroplasts are ellipses that contain well arranged granum and smooth thylakoid membranes they exhibited a typical mitochondrion structure with well displayed mitochondrion membranes organized in outer and inner membranes additionally transparent nuclei are apparent along with the well developed nuclear envelope fig 4 severe drought induced a noticeable ultrastructural alteration of cell organelles fig 4c g and k regarding well watered plants the chloroplasts with starch grain clung to the cell walls the chloroplasts were irregular in shape and asymmetrically swelling and clumped along typically forming aggregation fig 4c the chloroplast envelop was moderately ruptured and the thylakoid membranes were loose and disrupted while the thylakoid was overall disorganized the mitochondria were elongated and displayed an ellipse shape the outer membrane plugged and got unclear in some area where the cristae also obscured and curled the ubiquitous presence of mitochondria with the transparent matrix and very few cristae was also documented the cell nucleus distorted the outer membrane got damaged and even disappeared in some area fig 4g arrow application of chi si under well watered had an encouraging impact on organelles ultrastructure fig 4b f j compared with untreated control plants the chloroplasts were mainly elongated they possessed clearly defined envelope membranes well developed internal membrane systems composed of grana and long stromal thylakoids align with a kidney shaped starch grain fig 4b grana were distributed in a regular manner throughout the sectioned areas of chloroplasts and granal thylakoid was well developed and packed closely together mitochondria were principally oval elongated shape with electron dense matrix and clearly visible cristae fig 4j with well displayed mitochondrion membrane transparent nuclei were apparent along with well developed nuclear membrane fig 4f foliar application of chi si under severe drought fig 4d h l showed an ameliorative effect relative to the untreated stressed plants the chloroplasts shape modified faintly to ellipse close to the cell wall well aligned internal lamellar system ultrastructural changes in mitochondria were inconspicuous the most obvious observation in chloroplasts that appears more plastoglobule as compared with well watered or severe drought its number and size were increased markedly cell nuclei were clear and noticeable along with undamaged and remarkably nuclear membrane nuclear scaffold and nucleolus 3 5 yield and its components data presented in tables 5 and 6 clearly indicate that wheat yield and its components drastically declined with drought stress the great reduction for number of grain spike 21 and 19 grain weight spike 25 and 19 grain index 25 and 27 grain yield 32 and 32 straw yield 30 and 28 biological yield 16 and 31 as well as grain carbohydrates 12 and 13 and protein 19 and 16 in the first and second season respectively were recorded under severe drought relative to well watered plants foliar application with si and or chi significantly increased all yield and its components than the untreated plants the most effective treatment in this regard was si chi that increased number of grain spike 25 and 36 grain weight spike 22 and 27 grain index 35 and 34 grain yield 74 and 64 straw yield 49 and 41 biological yield 55 and 49 as well as grain carbohydrates 12 and 16 and protein 24 and 40 in the first and second season respectively relative to untreated control plants tables 5 and 6 foliar application of si and or chi nullifies the drastic injury of drought stress on wheat crop yield since application of si chi under severe drought increased the number of grain spike 58 and 46 grain weight spike 60 and 66 grain index 29 and 21 grain yield 67 and 44 straw yield 75 and 31 biological yield 18 and 50 as well as grain carbohydrates 14 and 24 and protein 32 and 45 in the first and second season respectively relative to untreated drought affected plants 3 6 water use efficiency wue data presented in table 6 proved that increasing drought stress significantly increased wue compared with well watered plants in the first season the highest wue 33 was obtained under mild drought compared with well watered plants meanwhile in the second seasons severe drought increased wue by 34 and 11 than well watered and mild drought respectively wue significantly increased by application of si and or chi above well watered plants where the maximum wue was obtained by application of si chi that increased it by 79 in the first season and by 59 in the second season table 6 the data in the same table clearly showed that application of si and or chi under moderate or severe drought improved wue relative to untreated well watered plants the highest wue 119 and 89 in the first and second season was obtained by application of si chi under moderate or severe drought stress respectively 4 discussion drought severely decreased plant development and productivity as reported previously farouk et al 2018 alghory and yazar 2019 sheshbahreh et al 2019 low abundant of water in the root zone may lead to shrinking in vascular tissue and reduced water absorption banon et al 2006 furthermore drought hinders the nutrient uptake and induces the ros production that evokes oxidative injury and consequently a decrease in plant growth farouk et al 2018 garcía caparrós et al 2019 current observation has established that either chi and or si supplementation under well watered or drought conditions exhibit extraordinary impacts on plant growth as compared with a well watered or untreated plant under such drought levels numerous possible mechanisms coupled with stress mitigation by chi and or si in higher plants have been recognized 1 improvement of water status that reflected to increase rwc and ion concentration as presented in the current investigation farouk et al 2018 safoora et al 2018 sheshbahreh et al 2019 2 increased the initiation of leaf primordial and declined plastochron duration that directs to increase leaf area and finally plant biomass alzahrani et al 2018 in the mid 80 s rwc was introduced as a good criterion for plant water status under water deficit maintaining rwc in plant cells at an excellent status confers the metabolic activity to be sustained by osmotic adjustment here a decline in rwc under drought has been noted previously farouk et al 2018 alghory and yazar 2019 garcía caparrós et al 2019 the rwc of chi and or si treated plants under well watered or water deficit was maintained at higher levels to an excellent level corresponding to stressed plants devoid of chi and or si application prompt that chi and or si will improve wheat water relation throughout the water deficit the improved ability to preserve water in plants treated with si might be caused by formation of silica cuticle double layer on leaf epidermis that composes an obstacle to water transpiration karmollachaab and gharineh 2015 moreover application of either chi or si stimulated the development and elongation of the root system and strengthens the capacity of water absorption as well as up regulation of aquaporin genes so as to enhance water retention and improved wue liu et al 2018 furthermore drought evokes hyper accumulation of ros that accelerates peroxidation of membrane lipids and consequently increases membrane permeability alzahrani et al 2018 farouk et al 2018 such damage can be caused by oxidation and cross linkage of protein thiols and inhibition of key membrane proteins as h atpase gong et al 2005 si and or chi supplementation to plants grown under well watered or stress condition lowered the values of plasma membrane permeability farouk et al 2017 alzahrani et al 2018 safoora et al 2018 this indicates that the application of chi and or si might sustain the stabilities of membranes in environmental stressed wheat plants severe drought altered photosynthetic pigment components and damaged the photosynthetic apparatus as indicated previously the decreases in photosynthetic pigment concentration under drought may be due to 1 inhibition of the biosynthesis of the chlorophyll pigment complexes encoded by the cab gene family prakash and ramachandran 2000 2 damage of chiral macro aggregates of the light harvesting pigment protein complexes that provide a protection to chloroplasts lai et al 2007 3 and or the loss of chloroplast membranes extreme swelling alteration of the lamellae vesiculation and the appearance of lipid droplets fig 3 the drastically increase in photosynthetic pigment concentration by chi and or si supplementation are in accordance with those of ghasemi pirbalouti et al 2017 safoora et al 2018 farouk and al sanoussi 2019 these increases may be attributed to well organized ros scavenging systems that will have otherwise damaged the chlorophyll by antioxidant enzymes and solutes farouk et al 2017 the carotenoids present functions as a light receptor and photo system shielded against ros which it has the capability to accumulate carotenoid accordingly the application of si lobato et al 2009 or chi farouk et al 2017 accelerates the over accumulation of carotenoids in photosynthetic tissues a widespread reaction of plants to water deficit is excess accumulation of various compatible organic and antioxidant solutes that are of small molecular weight extremely soluble and typically safe at high cellular concentrations without interfering with biochemical reactions pro is the most signalling molecule that influence cell proliferation and trigger specific gene expression which might be necessary for plant survival under drought farouk et al 2018 or si merwad et al 2018 safoora et al 2018 and chi ghasemi pirbalouti et al 2017 however pro metabolism in the presence of chi or si is not completely identified and need additional studies many authors showed that the importance of tsc in inducing pro accumulation through inhibition of the degradation enzymes and stimulated the pro synthesis enzymes accordingly hare and cress 1996 noticed that mrna transcript encoding p5cr was magnified in phloem tissue under drought the quantity of tsc was progressively rising in plants under drought or foliar application of either chi and or si relative to control plants the current investigation outcomes in accordance with farouk et al 2018 for drought alzahrani et al 2018 safoora et al 2018 for si bistgani et al 2017 for chi the tsc are widely accepted as an osmoprotectant that regulates the osmotic adjustment provide membrane protection and scavenge toxic ros against numerous stresses koyro et al 2012 normally plants constantly generate numerous ros throughout photosynthesis and respiration processes thus plants will sustain equilibrium by two diverse detoxification strategies involving enzymatic and non enzymatic antioxidants hidangmayum et al 2019 their concentrations magnified significantly in plant tissues under drought as well as chi and or si application farouk et al 2017 2018 compared with untreated control plants the asa is a critical hydrophilic non enzymatic antioxidant molecule that regulates the oxidation reduction system and protects them against stress smirnoff 2018 the present investigation postulated that elevated accretion of asa took place in the plant tissue under drought stress moreover foliar application of si and or chi additionally elicited this accumulation these results counsel that si and or chi are implicated in regulating antioxidant defense and so counteracted oxidative injure in water deficit affected plants since leaves are the major organs of internal water removal si and or chi treated plants under well watered or drought conditions undertaken leaf anatomical modifications to save water in fact wheat flag leaf treated with either si and or chi showed a thicker leaf blade and mesophyll than water treated plants under severe drought stress a thicker chlorenchyma could improve survival and growth under drought by enhancing plant cell water status in this concern el afry et al 2012 on wheat found that drought stress decreased the thickness of epidermis phloem tissue mesophyll tissue vascular bundles dimension additionally farouk et al 2017 merwad et al 2018 proved that chi application improved all anatomical characteristics of grapevine and cowpea respectively relative to untreated plants the extreme influence of drought on the stem and leaf anatomy of wheat plants may result from the decrease in net photosynthetic rates that decline or prevent water loss and decreases co2 availability for chloroplasts bertamini et al 2007 furthermore this effect could also be ascribed to the outcome of the enormous and irreversible expansion of small daughter cells produced by meristematic divisions and growth inhibition is thus associated with the inhibition of cell expansion in addition to reduced rates of new cell production may make an extra contribution to the inhibition of growth exploratory the ultrastructural alterations in plant cells under water deficit may be a convenient and valuable means for unveiling the essential strategies occupied in conferring drought tolerance cell organelles react quickly to environmental stress with a series of adaptation and avoidance strategies velikova et al 2009 farouk et al 2017 2018 severe drought deficit induced damages of the chloroplasts include excessive swelling of the external chloroplast membrane distortion of the stroma and interregnal lamellar system the collapse of organelle structure inhibiting photosynthesis and accumulation of lipid droplets in the chloroplasts numerous investigations have been postulated the existence of outsized and extra copious plastoglobules in chloroplasts from different plants grown under various environmental stresses farouk et al 2017 2018 the mechanism and the function of this modulation of plastoglobule size and number in relevance to stress don t seem to be nonetheless understood some investigations have established that the raised plastoglobules number under stress circumstances is associated with the elevated levels of plastoglobule specific proteins as well as increased production of small antioxidant molecules austin et al 2006 proteomic and ultrastructural studies of plastoglobules confirmed their essential roles in protecting thylakoid membranes from oxidative damage to the photosynthetic apparatus austin et al 2006 under normal conditions the mitochondria had a comparable size and appearance alternatively the drought affected plants had swollen mitochondria and a loss in the integrity of the external mitochondrial membrane cristae and huge electron transparent areas in the matrix comparable results have been documented on populus by wang et al 2015 the higher mitochondrial number meets the increased demand for atp under adverse circumstances once photosynthesis is greatly suppressed silva et al 2010 furthermore these organelles respond to stress by the synthesis of various specific mitochondrial stress proteins rizhsky et al 2004 in distinction to chloroplasts ultrastructural observations of mitochondria showed that these organelles were heavily influenced by stress however they still preserve their respiratory efficiency at extreme conditions vassileva et al 2009 water scarcity is a common stress feature that always reduces crop yield up to 50 relative to well watered plants farouk et al 2018 alghory and yazar 2019 this reduction may be resulted from reducing tiller number and flag leaf area table 2 resulting in less biomass production and hinder translocation of photoassimilate towards the developing fruits and or inducing flower and fruit abortion liu et al 2014 also song et al 1998 documented that drought evoked pollen swollen and filament development diminished filament fertility and resulted in declines in grain yield the increment in wheat yield attributable to si and or chi may result from their effects on inducing metabolic processes and anatomical alteration farouk et al 2017 behboudi et al 2018 merwad et al 2018 the yield enhancement by si corresponded to the preservation of higher net photosynthesis rate and improving the source sink relationship accordingly liang et al 2013 verified that si application accelerates lodging resistance by strengthening the stem base as well as leaves become additional erect therefore reducing self shading and increased photosynthesis capacity particularly during the grain filling period that connected with starch buildup in grains additionally si may be deposition under the leaf epidermis which may result in a physical mechanism of defense leading to decreases transpiration and increased photosynthetic capacity korndörfer et al 2004 obviously drought declined the protein and carbohydrate percentage in wheat grain these results are in harmony with those obtained by mahdy and teama 2000 hasanpour et al 2012 behboudi et al 2018 such impact might be caused by the decrease of co2 fixation a reduction of assimilates translocation and a decline in the expression of starch and protein synthesis genes younis et al 2000 it is clearly shown that grain protein percentage was decreased by drought however increased with the chi and or si application carbohydrate represented one of the main constituents of grain composition that markedly decreased under drought such effect could result from the decline in the photosynthetic rate that disrupts carbohydrate metabolism and might lead to the reduction in assimilating transported to sink organs thereby increasing the reproduction abortion as well as a reduction in expression of starch synthesis genes westgate 1994 on the other hand the increment in carbohydrate percentage of chi and or si pretreatment might be attributed to the increment of photosynthetic pigment leading to enhancement of carbohydrate synthesis and accumulation water stress drastically improved wue in both experimental seasons corresponding to well watered plants comparable outcome have been recorded by sheshbahreh et al 2019 on the other hand chi and or si under well watered or drought treatment increased wue this increases may be due to its effects on photosynthetic pigment biosynthesis and photosynthesis processes osmotic adjustment and antioxidant capacity which leads to increasing leaf area root growth and thus rising the water and nutrient absorption as indicated in the present investigation and other early reports safoora et al 2018 5 conclusion foliar applied chitosan and or silicon enhanced the accumulation of osmolytes and improved the entire anatomical characteristics of leaf and stem as well as maintained the microorganells ultrastructure in special chloroplasts that abled the wheat crops to protract the biological membranes under water scarcity resulting in better stay green under drought which eventually improved the plant growth increased grain yield and water use efficiency on conclusion spraying drought affected wheat plants with 125 mg l 1 sodium metasilicate plus 250 mg l 1 chitosan twice at 50 and 70 days from sowing could be a promising practice for alleviating the drought effects hence improves water use efficiency as well as enhancing crop yield and its quality funding this research neither received any specific grant from funding agencies in the public

10848,intelligent irrigation is one sustainable solution to reduce demands on water resources and adverse environmental impacts from irrigation specific case studies have quantified water savings with intelligent irrigation however water savings have not yet been quantified for urban agriculture or compared across climates before urban agriculture implements intelligent irrigation requiring an added cost and knowledge requirements of the control system the effects of the system must first be estimated for a broad range of climatic conditions we hypothesized that an intelligent irrigation

of the united states tomatoes were selected because they are sensitive to water stress the intelligent irrigation system included a wireless sensor network and controllable valves in addition we created the conventional scenario intelligent scenario index to compare the overall performance of an intelligent irrigation strategy to a conventional one our simulations showed that the intelligent irrigation scenario decreased water use on average by 59 in all sub humid climates while maintaining yield 0 reduction all sub humid climates 7 of 9 total zones fell within the fair to good index categories based on these results urban agricultural sites should consider installing intelligent irrigation systems if they are in sub humid climates in the two semi arid climates our intelligent irrigation scenario eliminated the 6 10 crop yield reductions of the conventional scenario but did not reduce water consumption both locations fell within the fair index category the minor

performance for various climates caetano et al 2015 before urban agriculture moves towards an intelligent irrigation system requiring an added cost and knowledge requirements of the control system the following questions must first be answered 1 will an intelligent urban irrigation system save water 2 will the results differ by climate we hypothesized that an intelligent urban irrigation system will decrease water use without reducing crop yield to test our hypothesis we modeled a drip irrigated urban garden growing tomatoes due to their sensitivity to water stress rinaldi et al 2007 waister and hudson 1970 the garden was modeled with a conventional and intelligent irrigation system for the nine climatic regions of the contiguous united states the intelligent irrigation system included a wireless soil moisture sensor network and controllable valves fig 1 irrigation performance of the two systems was evaluated based on two parameters water usage and crop yield reduction 2 materials and methods 2 1 cropwat model to quantify water savings and crop yield of an intelligent irrigation system an urban tomato garden was modeled using cropwat 8 0 smith 1992 cropwat is an empirical decision

shown to be a reliable tool to estimate the crop water demand aldaya and hoekstra 2010 bouraima et al 2015 knezevic et al 2013 rinaldi and he 2013 surendran et al 2015 tibebe et al 2016 cropwat has been used to estimate crop performance under various irrigation practices for a variety of crops and climates banerjee et al 2016 bouraima et al 2015 ekwue et al 2015 kizza et al 2016 laouisset and dellal 2016 surendran et al 2017 the cropwat model is based on the fao irrigation and drainage papers no 33 yield response to water and no 56 crop evapotranspiration allen et al 1998 doorenbos and kassam 1979 paper no 33 states the relative loss in yield is proportional to the relative reduction in evapotranspiration jensen 1968 the fundamental equation is as follows 1 y a y m a x k y 1 e t c a

climatic conditions a city was selected from each of the nine climatically consistent regions in the contiguous united states as developed by the u s national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa karl and koss 1984 the nine cities and climate regions include louisville kentucky central milwaukee wisconsin east north central philadelphia pennsylvania northeast portland oregon northwest dallas texas south atlanta georgia southeast salt lake city utah southwest sacramento california west and omaha nebraska west north central fig 1 climatic data was obtained from the climwat 2 0 database which includes long term 1971 2000 monthly mean agro meteorological data compiled by the fao for over 5000 stations worldwide smith 1993 a station from each of the nine cities was selected from climwat and imported into cropwat table 1 provides each region s seasonal mean relative humidity temperature and precipitation smith 1993 only monthly precipitation data is available from climwat therefore 2017 daily rainfall data was extracted for each city from noaa s online data portal 2 3 garden parameters urban garden programs often bring in new soil because urban soils can be poor growing mediums and also may be contaminated with heavy metals and harmful chemicals mitchell et al 2014 shayler et al 2009 therefore the modeled urban garden was assumed to be a raised bed garden filled with loam soil an ideal plant growing medium this assumption removes the variability of soil that would otherwise need to be considered for the different locations the raised bed was assumed to grow a single vegetable crop tomatoes due to their sensitivity to water stress waister and hudson 1970 the soil and crop parameters were pre loaded from cropwat tables 1 and 2 doorenbos and kassam 1979 smith 1992 planting dates were selected based on historical frost dates for each of the nine climatic regions the harvest date for tomatoes was assumed to be 145 days after planting a characteristic of the cropwat tomato file smith 1992 2 4 irrigation scenarios two irrigation scenarios were analyzed conventional and intelligent both scenarios assumed a drip irrigation system with 90 field application efficiency besides the intelligent scenario requiring additional equipment the irrigation schedule was the primary difference between the two scenarios 2 4 1 conventional irrigation scenario the conventional irrigation schedule assumed a fixed daily amount of water following the recommendations of the fao a standard reference crop grass was used to determine the irrigation requirements the seasonal water needs of the reference grass crop was calculated based on two specific parameters fao climatic zone rainfall regime and monthly temperatures the fao climate zones classified by average annual rainfall are desert arid semi arid sub humid and humid monthly temperatures are divided into three categories low 15 c medium 15 25 and high 25 c each climate region was placed into an fao climate zone table 3 based on the average annual rainfall and monthly average temperatures of each season spring summer and autumn water needs were calculated for the reference grass crop the reference grass crop water needs were then extrapolated to the tomato crop tomatoes need 10 more water in their peak period therefore grass water requirements were multiped by 1 1 for each climatic region brouwer and heibloem 1986 the effective rainfall the portion the plant can use and is not lost to deep percolation and or surface runoff was subtracted from this water requirement to determine the irrigation requirement per day table 3 the irrigation schedule was input into the crop irrigation schedule module of cropwat a consistent irrigation depth mm based on the season in each climate region was scheduled for every three days for example louisville central requires 0 6 mm day during the spring season therefore the conventional irrigation strategy provides 1 8 mm of water every three days during the spring season regardless of rainfall although it is practically impossible to provide exactly 1 8 mm of water and the farmer would likely provide more water than this each irrigation application it was assumed the farmer could provide this exact amount in order to have a conservative comparison between the conventional and intelligent irrigation scenarios 2 4 2 intelligent irrigation scenario this study models a simple intelligent irrigation system the system includes a microcontroller connected wirelessly to a network of soil moisture sensors the sensors send soil moisture readings to the microcontroller based on the readings the microcontroller sends commands to the actuator to open and close the solenoid valve the valve is connected to the water source and allows water to flow through the drip irrigation system irrigation starts and stops when the sensors read the minimum and maximum soil moisture setpoints minimum and maximum setpoints were tested in cropwat for each climate location to maximize water savings without compromising yields minimum setpoints were tested in increments of 5 for a range of 0 115 of critical depletion of soil moisture table 1 critical depletion defined as the critical soil moisture level where drought stress occurs affecting crop evapotranspiration and crop production is a set parameter for the tomato crop provided by fao in cropwat maximum setpoints were tested in increments of 5 for a range of 0 100 of soil field capacity soil field capacity is also a parameter set by fao in cropwat for loam soil the minimum and maximum setpoints used in the simulations were those that maximized water savings without reducing crop yields for all but two of the locations the optimal minimum and maximum setpoints were 100 of critical depletion and 5 of field capacity respectively for philadelphia northeast and atlanta southeast the optimal minimum and maximum setpoints were 105 of critical depletion and 5 of field capacity respectively 2 5 scenario performance 2 5 1 water use and yield reductions cropwat outputs a variety of parameters that can be used for comparing irrigation schedules the total gross irrigation was selected as the primary parameter for comparing the conventional and intelligent irrigation strategy gross irrigation represents the total water depth mm applied to the field smith 1992 only 90 of the gross irrigation depth effectively reaches the crop root zone due losses from the irrigation equipment both effective rainfall mm and yield reduction due to soil moisture stress were also used for comparing the two scenarios yield reduction is expressed as a percentage of the maximum production achievable in the area under optimal conditions smith 1992 2 5 2 csis index the conventional scenario intelligent scenario csis index was created to compare the overall performance of intelligent and conventional strategies the index provides a simple method to determine the best irrigation strategy for a specific crop and climate the index calculates the expected improvement of implementing an intelligent irrigation strategy instead of a conventional strategy the index is applicable when using cropwat and other computer simulations as well as laboratory and field data the csis index integrates two parameters water usage wu and yield reduction yr for both intelligent and conventional scenarios wu is expressed in mm and refers to the irrigated water as defined for conventional and intelligent scenarios in sections 2 4 1 and 2 4 2 respectively yr is expressed in percentage the equation is as follows c s i s 100 i n t e l w u m m c o n v w u m m 100 100 i n t e l y r c o n v y r 2 the csis index has a linear behavior with a range of 0 150 when the csis has a value of 150 it implies the best performance for the intelligent scenario no water usage beyond precipitation no yield reduction in the intelligent scenario and 100 yield reduction for the conventional scenario when the csis index has a value of 100 it signifies optimal performance for the intelligent scenario for example no water usage beyond precipitation and no yield reduction for the intelligent scenario at the other end of the spectrum a csis index value of 0 indicates the worst performance for the intelligent scenario 100 yield reduction and the same water usage as the conventional scenario intelligent irrigation systems as theoretically designed in the present study are made to maintain yield thus making values near 0 highly improbable however a value near 0 is possible if for example a significant irrigation system leak or malfunction occurs the leaking system continues to consume water but the water cannot reach the crop resulting in crop death moreover values near 150 are also rare due to the improbability of reaching 100 yield reduction in the conventional scenario in order to lose all crops serious crop mismanagement or natural disaster would need to occur in order to qualitatively classify the different values that can be obtained from the csis index we propose the following cluster assuming x is the value obtained by the csis index 1 very good if x 100 2 good if 75 x 100 3 fair if 50 x 75 4 poor if 25 x 50 5 very poor if x 25 therefore we can qualitatively state that a higher index value will have better performance with an intelligent irrigation scenario a score of 50 is obtained when the intelligent and conventional scenarios consume the same quantity of water with 0 yield reduction if the intelligent scenario has water savings and 0 yield reduction the index score will be larger than 50 therefore we recommend considering intelligent irrigation systems for locations that score within the fair to very good categories 50 further performance and cost benefit analyses should be done for locations falling in the very poor to poor categories before installation 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparing irrigation schedules the intelligent and conventional irrigation schedules varied dramatically from region to region fig 2 the conventional irrigation scenario had a set depth per season scheduled every three days for a total of 49 applications whereas the intelligent scenario only irrigated when necessary fewer intelligent irrigation applications occurred for all climate regions except sacramento west and salt lake southwest philadelphia northeast louisville central and atlanta southeast required the smallest number applications 1 6 and 9 respectively sacramento west and salt lake southwest required 98 and 116 irrigation applications respectively these two semi arid climates have low humidity high temperatures and receive little rainfall therefore they require frequent irrigation the irrigation not only varied in terms of number of applications but also in seasonal requirements fig 2 portland northwest atlanta southeast philadelphia northeast and louisville central only required irrigation in the summer meeting the rest of their crop water needs with precipitation only dallas south and sacramento west required irrigation only in late spring and summer both growing seasons end before autumn omaha wn central and milwaukee en central meet their spring water needs with precipitation but required irrigation in summer and autumn due to lack of precipitation salt lake southwest required irrigation during all three seasons 3 2 comparing scenario outcomes significant water savings were achieved with the intelligent irrigation scenario fig 3 the average water savings for all nine climates was 46 with a minimum savings of 2 in salt lake city southwest and a maximum of 94 in philadelphia northeast sacramento west resulted in a 3 increase in water usage to improve yield reduction from 6 0 to 0 greater water savings were found in the sub humid climates with an average savings of 59 and a range of 26 to 94 in omaha wn central and philadelphia northeast respectively table 4 the semi arid locations salt lake city southwest and sacramento west had a water savings of 2 and a water increase of 3 respectively the intelligent strategy uses rainfall more efficiently than the conventional strategy although both scenarios have the same amount of effective rainfall for each location the fraction of effective rainfall that was useful for the plants was different this useful portion is referred to as consumptive effective rainfall for example the amount of total growing season rainfall converted to consumptive effective rainfall was on average 48 and 79 for the conventional and intelligent scenarios respectively table 4 this is because the conventional irrigation strategy continues to irrigate even if it rains if the soil is already saturated from precipitation or irrigation the additional rainfall is likely lost to deep percolation and runoff on the other hand the intelligent scenario does not irrigate if the soil is moist from precipitation or a previous irrigation application it maintains the soil within a predetermined moisture range so that when precipitation occurs the rainfall is effectively utilized consumptive effective rainfall improvements from intelligent irrigation vary for the sub humid and semi arid locations the intelligent scenarios increased the consumptive effective rainfall by 36 and 15 in sub humid and semi arid climates respectively table 4 this is because the semi arid climates receive less than half of the total growing season rainfall than their sub humid counterparts losing less to deep percolation and runoff the intelligent irrigation strategy can further increase water savings if crop yield reductions are allowed for example looking at the two locations with conventional yield reductions we can realize greater water savings with some yield reductions changing salt lake s southwest intelligent irrigation schedule to begin at 125 of critical depletion and end at 5 of field capacity resulted in yield reductions of 5 1 but an additional 10 water savings by reducing gross irrigation from 906 9 to 812 0 mm similarly changing sacramento s west intelligent irrigation schedule to begin at 135 of critical depletion and end at 5 of field capacity resulted in yield reductions of 9 1 but 13 water savings by reducing gross irrigation from 852 7 to 722 3 mm these simulations show additional water savings can be realized if crop yield reductions are allowed the water saving and crop yield results for our urban applications are comparable to other published conventional agricultural field studies pfitscher et al achieved 85 water savings with intelligent irrigation for rice crops in a humid climate pfitscher et al 2012 savings of 85 in a humid climate is logical when our sub humid climates saved 59 on average with two locations saving over 80 two other studies tested intelligent irrigation for tomato crops in arid climates finding water savings ranging from 23 to 26 with improved yields al ghobari et al 2015 mohammad et al 2013 although their water savings are higher than our results which may be attributed to different conventional strategies they are still lower than those found in the humid climate supporting our trend that water savings increase as you move from arid to humid climates 3 3 csis index the conventional scenario intelligent scenario csis index provides the ability to compare the overall performance of the intelligent and conventional irrigation scenarios the index provides one number per location encompassing both the changes in water usage and yield reductions the index provides a simple way of comparing scenarios to determine the best irrigation strategy for a specific crop and climate table 4 shows the csis index values and categories for each of the nine climate regions the values range from 54 to 97 in sacramento west and philadelphia northeast respectively the two semi arid locations fall within the fair category but they are very close to poor these two locations saw relatively no water savings and only small yield improvements suggesting intelligent irrigation may not be worth the added installation costs due to little rainfall in semi arid locations most of the water consumed comes from irrigation therefore in these locations an intelligent irrigation system cannot dramatically improve consumptive effective rainfall like in the sub humid climates in the sub humid climates the intelligent irrigation system adjusts accordingly to the high frequency of rainfall resulting in less irrigation applications and depths these larger water savings with no yield reductions are why the sub humid climates fall within the fair to good categories falling within these categories make the sub humid climates excellent candidates for intelligent urban irrigation systems 4 conclusion in the semi arid climates in the united states or elsewhere in the world a cost benefit analysis should be completed before intelligent urban irrigation systems are implemented these simulations showed minor crop yield improvements with the intelligent scenario but similar water use as the conventional scenario the minor improvements in yield may not outweigh the added cost and knowledge requirements of the control system in semi arid climates cost benefit analysis may be necessary to determine if installation is worthwhile the installation of intelligent urban irrigation systems should be considered in sub humid climates in these locations the water savings may outweigh the added costs of the system our simulations showed the intelligent irrigation scenario maintained crop yields and reduced water use on average by 59 in the sub humid climates the broad umbrella of sub humid comprises a total of seven unique and consistent climates determined through climate analysis by noaa these seven locations had similar water savings and yield reductions leading to the conclusion that intelligent urban irrigation should result in water savings in sub humid climates around the world this study focused on water savings with intelligent irrigation systems cost is very important for the potential adoption of this technology future work should carry out a cost benefit analysis of these systems for various climates overall the water savings from intelligent urban irrigation systems aligns with other published studies on intelligent irrigation of conventional agricultural field sites no discernable differences exist between urban and conventional agriculture in this respect our results support the trend that water savings increase as you move from arid to humid climates with intelligent irrigation systems therefore intelligent irrigation is one sustainable solution for urban agriculture as shown in

10848,intelligent irrigation is one sustainable solution to reduce demands on water resources and adverse environmental impacts from irrigation specific case studies have quantified water savings with intelligent irrigation however water savings have not yet been quantified for urban agriculture or compared across climates before urban agriculture implements intelligent irrigation requiring an added cost and knowledge requirements of the control system the effects of the system must first be estimated for a broad range of climatic conditions we hypothesized that an intelligent irrigation system will decrease water use without reducing crop yield with cropwat we modeled an urban tomato garden irrigated conventionally to one irrigated intelligently in each of the nine climatic regions of the united states tomatoes were selected because they are sensitive to water stress the intelligent irrigation system included a wireless sensor network and controllable valves in addition we created the conventional scenario intelligent scenario index to compare the overall performance of an intelligent irrigation strategy to a conventional one our simulations showed that the intelligent irrigation scenario decreased water use on average by 59 in all sub humid climates while maintaining yield 0 reduction all sub humid climates 7 of 9 total zones fell within the fair to good index categories based on these results urban agricultural sites should consider installing intelligent irrigation systems if they are in sub humid climates in the two semi arid climates our intelligent irrigation scenario eliminated the 6 10 crop yield reductions of the conventional scenario but did not reduce water consumption both locations fell within the fair index category the minor improvements in the semi arid climates may not outweigh the added system costs keywords intelligent irrigation conventional irrigation urban agriculture cropwat conventional scenario intelligent

was placed into an fao climate zone table 3 based on the average annual rainfall and monthly average temperatures of each season spring summer and autumn water needs were calculated for the reference

to determine the irrigation requirement per day table 3 the irrigation schedule was input into the crop irrigation schedule module of cropwat a consistent irrigation depth mm based on the season in each climate region was scheduled for every three days for example louisville central requires 0 6 mm day during the spring season therefore the conventional irrigation strategy provides 1 8 mm of

irrigation was selected as the primary parameter for comparing the conventional and intelligent irrigation strategy gross irrigation represents the total water depth mm applied to the field smith 1992 only 90 of the gross irrigation depth effectively reaches the crop root zone due losses from the irrigation equipment both effective rainfall mm and yield reduction due to soil moisture stress were also used for comparing the two scenarios yield reduction is expressed as a percentage of the maximum production achievable in the area under optimal conditions smith 1992 2 5 2 csis index the conventional scenario intelligent scenario csis index was created to compare the overall performance of intelligent and conventional strategies the index provides a simple method to determine the best irrigation strategy for a specific crop and climate the index calculates the expected improvement of implementing an intelligent irrigation strategy instead of a conventional strategy the index is applicable when using cropwat and other computer simulations as well as laboratory and field data the csis index integrates two parameters water usage wu and yield reduction yr for both intelligent and conventional scenarios wu is expressed in mm and refers to the irrigated water as defined for conventional and intelligent scenarios in sections 2 4 1 and 2 4 2 respectively yr is expressed in percentage the equation is as follows c s i s 100 i n t e l w u m m c o n v w u m m 100 100 i n t e l y r c o n v y r 2 the csis index has a linear behavior with a range of 0 150 when the csis has a value of 150 it implies the best performance for the intelligent scenario no water usage beyond precipitation no yield reduction in the intelligent scenario and 100 yield reduction for the conventional scenario when the csis index has a value of 100 it signifies optimal performance for the intelligent scenario for example no water usage beyond precipitation and no yield reduction for the intelligent scenario at the other end of the spectrum a csis index value of 0 indicates the worst performance for the intelligent scenario 100 yield reduction and the same water usage as the conventional scenario intelligent irrigation systems as theoretically designed in the present study are made to maintain yield thus making values near 0 highly improbable however a value near 0 is possible if for example a significant irrigation system leak or malfunction occurs the leaking system continues to consume water but the water cannot reach the crop resulting in crop death moreover values near 150 are also rare due to the improbability of reaching 100 yield reduction in the conventional scenario in order to lose all crops serious crop mismanagement or natural disaster would need to occur in order to qualitatively classify the different values that can be obtained from the csis index we propose the following cluster assuming x is the value obtained by the csis index 1 very good if x 100 2 good if 75 x 100 3 fair if 50 x 75 4 poor if 25 x 50 5 very poor if x 25 therefore we can qualitatively state that a higher index value will have better performance with an intelligent irrigation scenario a score of 50 is obtained when the intelligent and conventional scenarios consume the same quantity of water with 0 yield reduction if the intelligent scenario has water savings and 0 yield reduction the index score will be larger than 50 therefore we recommend considering intelligent irrigation systems for locations that score within the fair to very good categories 50 further performance and cost benefit analyses should be done for locations falling in the very poor to poor categories before installation 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparing irrigation schedules the intelligent and conventional irrigation schedules varied dramatically from region to region fig 2 the conventional irrigation scenario had a set depth per season scheduled every three days for a total of 49 applications whereas the intelligent scenario only irrigated when necessary fewer intelligent irrigation applications occurred for all climate regions except sacramento west and salt lake southwest philadelphia northeast louisville central and atlanta southeast required the smallest number applications 1 6 and 9 respectively sacramento west and salt lake southwest required 98 and 116 irrigation applications respectively these two semi arid climates have low humidity high temperatures and receive little rainfall therefore they require frequent irrigation the irrigation not only varied in terms of number of applications but also in seasonal requirements fig 2 portland northwest atlanta southeast philadelphia northeast and louisville central only required irrigation in the summer meeting the rest of their crop water needs with precipitation only dallas south and sacramento west required irrigation only in late spring and summer both growing seasons end before autumn omaha wn central and milwaukee en central meet their spring water needs with precipitation but required irrigation in summer and autumn due to lack of precipitation salt lake southwest required irrigation during all three seasons 3 2 comparing scenario outcomes significant water savings were achieved with the intelligent irrigation scenario fig 3 the average water savings for all nine climates was 46 with a minimum savings of 2 in salt lake city southwest and a maximum of 94 in philadelphia northeast sacramento west resulted in a 3 increase in water usage to improve yield reduction from 6 0 to 0 greater water savings were found in the sub humid climates with an average savings of 59 and a range of 26 to 94 in omaha wn central and philadelphia northeast respectively table 4 the semi arid locations salt lake city southwest and sacramento west had a water savings of 2 and a water increase of 3 respectively the intelligent strategy uses rainfall more efficiently than the conventional strategy although both scenarios have the same amount of effective rainfall for each location the fraction of effective rainfall that was useful for the plants was different this useful portion is referred to as consumptive effective rainfall for example the amount of total growing season rainfall converted to consumptive effective rainfall was on average 48 and 79 for the conventional and intelligent scenarios respectively table 4 this is because the conventional irrigation strategy continues to irrigate even if it rains if the soil is already saturated from precipitation or irrigation the additional rainfall is likely lost to deep percolation and runoff on the other hand the intelligent scenario does not irrigate if the soil is moist from precipitation or a previous irrigation application it maintains the soil within a predetermined moisture range so that when precipitation occurs the rainfall is effectively utilized consumptive effective rainfall improvements from intelligent irrigation vary for the sub humid and semi arid locations the intelligent scenarios increased the consumptive effective rainfall by 36 and 15 in sub humid and semi arid climates respectively table 4 this is because the semi arid climates receive less than half of the total growing season rainfall than their sub humid counterparts losing less to deep percolation and runoff the intelligent irrigation strategy can further increase water savings if crop yield reductions are allowed for example looking at the two locations with conventional yield reductions we can realize greater water savings with some yield reductions changing salt lake s southwest intelligent irrigation schedule to begin at 125 of critical depletion and end at 5 of field capacity resulted in yield reductions of 5 1 but an additional 10 water savings by reducing gross irrigation from 906 9 to 812 0 mm similarly changing sacramento s west intelligent irrigation schedule to begin at 135 of critical depletion and end at 5 of field capacity resulted in yield reductions of 9 1 but 13 water savings by reducing gross irrigation from 852 7 to 722 3 mm these simulations show additional water savings can be realized if crop yield reductions are allowed the water saving and crop yield results for our urban applications are comparable to other published conventional agricultural field studies pfitscher et al achieved 85 water savings with intelligent irrigation for rice crops in a humid climate pfitscher et al 2012 savings of 85 in a humid climate is logical when our sub humid climates saved 59 on average with two locations saving over 80 two other studies tested intelligent irrigation for tomato crops in arid climates finding water savings ranging from 23 to 26 with improved yields al ghobari et al 2015 mohammad et al 2013 although their water savings are higher than our results which may be attributed to different conventional strategies they are still lower than those found in the humid climate supporting our trend that water savings increase as you move from arid to humid climates 3 3 csis index the conventional scenario intelligent scenario csis index provides the ability to compare the overall performance of the intelligent and conventional irrigation scenarios the index provides one number per location encompassing both the changes in water usage and yield reductions the index provides a simple way of comparing scenarios to determine the best irrigation strategy for a specific crop and climate table 4 shows the csis index values and categories for each of the nine climate regions the values range from 54 to 97 in sacramento west and philadelphia northeast respectively the two semi arid locations fall within the fair category but they are very close to poor these two locations saw relatively no water savings and only small yield improvements suggesting intelligent irrigation may not be worth the added installation costs due to little rainfall in semi arid locations most of the water consumed comes from irrigation therefore in these locations an intelligent irrigation system cannot dramatically improve consumptive effective rainfall like in the sub humid climates in the sub humid climates the intelligent irrigation system adjusts accordingly to the high frequency of rainfall resulting in less irrigation applications and depths these larger water savings with no yield reductions are why the sub humid climates fall within the fair to good categories falling within these categories make the sub humid climates excellent candidates for intelligent urban irrigation systems 4 conclusion in the semi arid climates in the united states or elsewhere in the world a cost benefit analysis should be completed before intelligent urban irrigation systems are implemented these simulations showed minor crop yield improvements with the intelligent scenario but similar water use as the conventional scenario the minor improvements in yield may not outweigh the added cost and knowledge requirements of the control system in semi arid climates cost benefit analysis may be necessary to determine if installation is worthwhile the installation of intelligent urban irrigation systems should be considered in sub humid climates in these locations the water savings may outweigh the added costs of the system our simulations showed the intelligent irrigation scenario maintained crop yields and reduced water use on average by 59 in the sub humid climates the broad umbrella of sub humid comprises a total of seven unique and consistent climates determined through climate analysis by noaa these seven locations had similar water savings and yield reductions leading to the conclusion that intelligent urban irrigation should result in water savings in sub humid climates around the world this study focused on water savings with intelligent irrigation systems cost is very important for the potential adoption of this technology future work should carry out a cost benefit analysis of these systems for various climates overall the water savings from intelligent urban irrigation systems aligns with other published studies on intelligent irrigation of conventional agricultural field sites no discernable differences exist between urban and conventional agriculture in this respect our results support the trend that water savings increase as you move from arid to humid climates with intelligent irrigation systems therefore intelligent irrigation is one sustainable solution for urban agriculture as shown in

detrimental effects of irrigation shortage on sugar beet grown in cadmium cd contaminated salty soil in this regard two experiments were conducted in open field during 2016 17 and 2017 18 at el fayoum

in particular increased root yield by 53 49 and 15 93 compared to control the results revealed that the detrimental impacts of drought stress can be greatly reduced by using nc as a soil amendment for sugar beet production the results also revealed combining deficit irrigation and nc maximized crop water productivity keywords sugar beet soil properties plant water status physiology photosynthetic efficiency irrigation use efficiency 1 introduction sugar beet is considered as a significant sugar crop which approximately provides about 35 of global sugar needs and widely cultivated especially in dry and semi dry districts wu et al 2013 globally in 2016 the productivity of sugar beet approximately amounted 266 8 million ton which produced from 4 47 million hectares by average root yield of 59 6 ton per hectare faostat 2016 crop productivity is extremely affected by various abiotic stressors such as metals contamination salinity and drought abbasi et al 2016 abd el mageed et al 2018 cadmium

biochemical responses via osmotic and ionic stressors in plants rady et al 2018 generally salinity stress reduces mineral supplement take up plant development and biomass semida et al 2016 sugar beet growth plants showed tolerance to salt stress depending on the growth stage or cultivar hills et al 1990 sugar industry in egypt is based on both sugar beet and sugar cane crops sugar beet is considered as one of the main strategic crops contributing of approximately 50 in the net egyptian sugar production 1 255 million tons faostat 2016 however egypt experiences difficulties to narrow the gap between sugar production and its consumption which reaches about one million ton year abu zaida 2014 in mediterranean area one of these attempts was to increase sugar beet productivity nowadays egypt is facing several challenges such as drought and natural aridity desertification and water shortage caused by the human being and climate change kang et al 2017 in this regard developing technical practices and applying the innovative water saving technologies should be presented for increasing yield and quality of sugar beet the greatest water consuming sector is irrigated agriculture about 80 of worldwide fresh water which faces competing demands from other sectors sander and bastiaanssen 2004 therefore the core contest of the agricultural division is how to use less water for producing more food which could be achieved by enhancing water use efficiency deficit irrigation di established in agriculture to develop irrigation water efficiency sadras 2009 sepaskhah and ahmadi 2010 the di is a valuable production technique generally used under water deficiency conditions badal et al 2013 ramazan et al 2014 and agami et al 2018 the cultivation of sugar beet in sandy loam soil revealed that the yield and sucrose content were higher under trickle irrigation system compared to furrow irrigation sharmasarkar et al 2001 tognetti et al 2002 examined the performance of sugar beet planted under five irrigation water regimes control not irrigated 50 75 100 and 120 of etc he found that yield of roots and sucrose percentage were higher with increasing the volume of the applied irrigation water whereas the non watered plants produced the lowest technological yield characteristics it has been demonstrated by many research groups that water deficits caused a series of deterioration of physio morphological characteristics of sugar beet plants shaw et al 2002 mahmoodi et al 2008 and yonts 2011 therefore increase crop yield under drought stress is considered as the main aim via crossbreeding or genetic engineering programs cattivelli et al 2008 to tackle this problem conventionally chemical treatment and agronomical crop management practices have been applied to decrees the detrimental effects of water deficiency manivannan et al 2007 alternatively compost as organic fertilization plays an essential role in diminishing the utilization of chemical fertilizers reducing its harmful impact on soil environment and sustainable agriculture francis and daniel 2004 this could be possibly explained by its positive influences on the soil

resulted in promoting of plant growth and increasing of crop yield gosling et al 2006 rajaa and saadi 2011 abd el mageed et al 2018 improvement of soil aggregation could be rationally attributed to its effects on moisture soil content aeration temperature and physical impedance impacts on the growth of roots and seedling emergence ferreras et al 2000 in this concern mahmoud et al 2012 examined the effects of application of three compost levels 0 2 5 and 5 t ha 1 on the productivity of sugar beet and reported that increasing compost addition rate from 0 to 5 t ha1 increased root and sugar yields by 16 4 and 27 8 respectively in this study animal blood contains high percentage of protein macro and micro nutrients has been mixed with sugarcane bagasse sugarcane bagasse sb contains organic carbon total fibers these components enrich the compost in favor of the growing plants through improving of the soil characteristics physical and chemical as a result the content of nutrients will increase and easily uptaken by growing plants leading to noticeable increase of growth and productivity of sugar beet however the studies detailed with the suitability of composting blood animals with sugarcane bagasse and its utility as a favorable source for organic matter are very limited owing to considerable evidence of the adverse influences of abiotic stressors on plant growth it was hypothesized that the novel compost used in our investigation as a soil amendment can overcome the deleterious impacts of stresses on sugar beet plants thus one of the main objectives of this study was to examine whether the novel compost could alleviate the effects of water deficit on the plants furthermore it is important to test also its impacts on growth yield sugar yield and its quality by adjusting the soil moisture content plant water status and morpho physiological responses 2 methodology 2 1 experiment design and location we conducted two experiments during two growing seasons from

results and discussion 3 1 effects of the novel compost application on some soil properties novel compost nc applied to the soil showed noticeable impacts on its physiochemical properties where soil ph and soil electrical conductivity ece strongly affected p 0 05 by increasing the rates of nc table 4 this could be possibly attributed to the increasing of cation exchange capacity cec 41 3 and the accumulation of active organic acids of nc which led to a reduction in ph values moreover the ph of the novel compost has an acidic effect 6 44 table 3 resulted in a decrease of soil ph the ece reduction may be due to the existence of the charged sites i e coo accounts for the capability of the nc to chelate and retain cations in non active formulas abd el mageed et al 2016 and 2018 and semida et al 2014 also lower ec of the nc 2 98 ds m 1 table 3 contributed to moderate the soil ece moreover nc applications at rates of 10 and 20 t ha 1 significantly increased the om content of studied soil also it was noted that a steady decrease in the determined of soil bulk density values with increasing nc rates where the lowest measured b d value 1 52 g cm 3 was associated to the maximum addition 20 t ha 1 nc such behavior may refer to the effective role of colloidal particles of organic matter on soil particles rearrangement and modifying pore spaces distribution pattern which caused an increase in the bulk volume and hence decreased the bulk density and increase the total porosity of soil these results are in line with the previous studies of abd el mageed et al 2018 and abd el mageed and semida 2015 who demonstrated that bulk density was very associated to solid phase properties and pore size distribution also compared to control when the soil supplemented by 20 t ha 1 of nc the total porosity water holding pores useful pores were also increased by 6 6 25 12 and 19 46 as average for two years respectively the further positive effect of nc at the highest rate was observed on soil moisture relationships where field capacity and available water content improved by 15 and 25 12 respectively the above mentioned case could be attributed to the increased whc of nc 7 21 g water g nc and also increased total fibers 29 4 table 3 it is very likely the utilization of nc activated the creation processes of medium and or micropores between simple packing and sand particles resulting in an increase in capillary potential moreover the released organic substances have a great ability to maintain a pronounced content of soil water accordingly these findings and statements are consistent with those documented by cheng et al 1998 semida et al 2014 semida et al 2015 and rady et al 2016b who noted that active organic materials greatly decreased the loss of soil moisture and ameliorated the water retention the nc positively affected on the properties of saline soil e i aeration permeability aggregation and whc and led to preserve the appropriate of soil water content and hence increased the activity of the invulnerable plant system 3 2 growth characteristics irrigation novel compost treatments and the impacts of their interactions on growth attributes are presented in table 5 growth parameters strongly affected by the irrigation regime the greatest values of root length 29 6 cm root diameter 16 39 cm leaves number 79 20 plant 1 dry matter 724 g and leaves area 1084 dm2 were observed and recorded under 100 of iwa on the other hand increasing water stress level to 60 etc reduced these traits by 13 85 17 69 32 51 36 42 and 37 03 respectively these results clarify that increasing soil moisture availability in the root zone by applying irrigation at i100 may enhance plants to assimilate more water which caused an increase in photosynthesis activity cells division and cells enlargement our results are in concurrence with those documented by abayomi and wright 2002 kiziloglu et al 2006 and mahmoodi et al 2008 who noticed that water shortage in the early stage of the sugar beet pronounce a negative effect on leaf growth rate of leaf extension area of individual leaf and leaf area index abo shady et al 2010 revealed that prolonging drought period increased root length while it decreased root yield and root diameter sabreen et al 2018 observed that when sugar beet watered at the level of 50 etc root length root diameter and roots yield were negatively affected in our study the unfavorable effect of drought stress on these studied traits was declined by the suppling of nc table 5 in addition the application of nc from zero control to 20 t ha 1 positively increased root length root diameter leaves number dry matter and leaves area by 17 81 15 14 26 88 24 11 and 41 50 respectively these findings may be referred to the ameliorative effect of nc application on improving soil physico chemical properties soil water relationships enhanced root elongation and consequently increased water and nutrient uptake by plants which may indirectly reflect on increasing root cells division and enlargement and whole vegetation growth these results are consistent hegazi 2004 berhanu et al 2013 and sabreen and mansour 2015 in summary the data presented clearly substantiates the findings that the best values of growth parameters achieved at irrigation level 100 of etc combined with 20 t ha 1 of nc 3 3 plant water status effects of novel compost nc and water stress on msi and rwc values are presented in table 6 statistical analysis carried out on msi and rwc shows a significant variance p 0 05 between season and both nc and deficit irrigation treatments with increasing water stress msi and rwc were decreased however applying of nc was found to alter the iwa affected msi and rwc the highest values for such parameters resulted from the application of nc20 i100 treatment the rwc and msi are indicators of plant water status semida et al 2017 rwc refers to the plant water content and it has been used as a meaningful index of dehydration tolerance while the msi indicates the integrity of cell membranes likewise it has been generally utilized as an indicator of leaf desiccation tolerance abd el mageed et al 2018 a relationship was recorded between rwc and sugar beet biomass fresh and dry weight under the combined effect of deficit irrigation and nc indicating that plant water status is mostly dependent on the corresponding shoot biomass this also suggested that plants having greater biomass can retain higher water content in leaf and thus can be more tolerant to abiotic stress e i drought salinity and cadmium toxicity according to kabir et al 2004 and abd el mageed et al 2018 crops having greater fresh biomass can maintain higher water content in leaf leading to more tolerance to abiotic stress 3 4 chlorophyll fluorescence and chlorophyll relative index spad value the combined effects of nc and iwa on chlorophyll fluorescence fv fm performance index pi and chlorophyll relative index spad value were shown in table 6 these traits were significantly decreased gradually with the gradual increase in irrigation regime overall growing seasons si 2016 17 and sii 2017 18 nevertheless suppling of nc has been shown to alleviate the damaging effects of abiotic stresses on fv fm pi and spad values the maximum values of fv fm pi and spad were recorded when plants irrigated well i100 combined with 20 t ha 1 of nc furthermore the minimum values of fv fm pi and spad were observed under i60 0 t ha 1of nc treatment higher fv fm pi and spad produced higher root fresh weight kg root yield tha 1 and consequently increase white sugar yield tables 5 and 6 many studies suggested that chlorophyll fluorescence analysis may be used as a dependable method to measure the changes in the function of psii under various stress conditions habibi 2012 the photosynthetic activity reduction might be a result of low photochemical efficiency of psii as exposed by its lower quantum yield abd el mageed et al 2017 our results recorded reductions in fv fm pi and spad under di stress conditions which were possibly due to the reduction in leaf photosynthetic pigments and rwc table 6 needed for photosynthesis the results are parallel with those of habibi 2012 isopp et al 2000 and rady et al 2016a used a differ compost and found that compost have favored leaf growth and a new sink developed which would decrease soluble carbohydrates photosynthesis is also highly responded to the plant s water supply numerous studies documented that the disruption of water flow can cause a reduction in water content in assimilation tissue in turn leads to photosynthetic depression fahim et al 2014 abd el mageed et al 2017 semida et al 2017 3 5 cd concentration application of novel compost nc at a rate of 10 or 20 t ha 1 showed significant decreases p 0 05 in the concentrations of cd2 in leaves and roots of plant grown in cd contaminated soil compared to the unamended soil fig 1 although cd2 is a non essential element for plants it is easily uptake by plants growing on cd2 contaminated or soils cd2 supplemented entering the food chain and causing harm to plant and human health kabata pendias and pendias 2001 fig 1 showed that plants grown in cd2 contaminated soil received 10 and or 20 ton nc per hectare have lower concentrations of cd by 24 9 and 35 7 for leaves and by 37 9 and 59 for roots as average for both seasons as compared with control 0 t h 1 the availability of cd to plants was reduced by nc application maybe due to the surface adsorption and precipitation of novel compost reduction of cd content in leaves and roots probably due to the surface functional groups and adsorption sites on novel compost which could increase cec of the studied soil and consequently increase soil cd exchange capacity through the creation of complexes with cationic metals the reduction of cd uptake leaves or and roots grown in amended soil with nc probably due to the highly porous structure of nc active functional groups and cation exchange capacity cec moreover the indirect effect of nc on properties of soil physical and chemical consequently impact on cd retention or release these findings are in accordance with those of eissa 2018 pandit et al 2012 and rady et al 2016b 3 6 yields harvest index and irrigation use efficiency root fresh weight plant root yield t ha 1 biomass yield and harvest index hi significantly increased and recorded maximum values table 7 under fully irrigated i100 for harvest index hi no differences between i100 and i80 were found on the other hand when plants subjected to the severe irrigation regime 60 these traits were reduced by 47 12 31 44 37 57 and 4 76 respectively table 7 these results were confirmed by noghabi and williams 2000 who noted that stress occurs during early stages of growth may negatively affect root growth and resulted in yield loss by 46 masri et al 2015 showed that root yield strongly increased by increasing irrigation water requirement from 50 up to 75 and 100 also mohamed et al 2018 concluded that rwc and stomatal conductance for sugar beet plants were decreased under water stress and consequently growth and yield of sugar beet were decreased also it was recorded that applying 20 t ha 1 of nc caused a significant improvement in the above mentioned parameters wael et al 2015 noted that application of inorganic and bio organic fertilizers affected the plant growth components under the semi arid zone the highest sugar yield was obtained under 20 t ha1 of nc i100 and the lowest value achieved under 0 t ha1 of nc i60 table7 according to fig 2 it could be expressed between irrigation water applied iwa and root yield ry by using the following relationship polynomial of 2nd order ry 7e 06 x iwa2 0 0502 x iwa 134 2 r² 0 85 for si 2016 17 ry 1e 07x iwa2 0 0112 x iwa 15 534 r2 0 91 for sii 2017 18 where ry is the root yield t ha 1 and iwa is irrigation water applied m3 ha 1 moreover the obtained results demonstrated that the most severed irrigating regime i60 produced the lower root yields it provided the higher iue value by 15 51 which decreased by 13 79 when compared with that recorded under i100 compared with control applying nc at its maximum rate 20 t ha 1 increased soil capacity to retain water and consequently increased iue by 53 61 as shown in fig 2 the relationship between iwa and iue was curvilinear polynomial of 2nd order and it could be expressed as follows iue 2e 06 x iwa2 0 0137x iwa 41 081 r² 0 69 for si 2016 17 iue 1e 07 x iwa2 0 0019 x iwa 20 384 r2 0 82 for sii 2017 18 where iue is the root irrigation use efficiency kg m 3 and iwa is irrigation water applied m3 ha 1 generally the highest values of iue were obtained under i60 this result is in line with that of nourjou 2008 esmaeili 2011 topak et al 2011 ghamarnia et al 2012 3 7 white sugar yield impurities and purity results in table 8 showed that drip irrigated plants with 100 etc produced highest white sugar yield 15 38 t ha 1 and α amino n 1 28 moreover applying the adequate irrigation treatment i100 caused an increase in both of sugar lose yield 2 9 t ha 1 and white sugar 15 38 t ha 1 where percentage of purity 83 47 was the lowest value as compared to i60 reduction in sugar yield under severe water deficit regime probably due to the lower root yield table 7 masri et al 2015 mentioned that technological attributes sucrose purity and extractable sugar with increasing water stress additionally the above studied traits significantly responded to a novel compost applying 20 t ha 1 of nc positively increased white sugar yield and purity by 65 5 and 3 23 respectively and significantly reduced α amino n and sugar lost yield by 11 and 12 20 compared with control respectively these findings agrees with hosseinpour et al 2006 mahmoud et al 2012 and tognetti et al 2003 who observed that applying 20 t ha 1 of organic compost significantly produced the greatest leave area and the highest root yield and improved the quality of juice traits sucrose extractable sugar and purity 3 8 correlation analysis data presented in tables 9 and 10 showed the correlation coefficients between sugar beet productivity from white sugar and the other yield components this kind of analysis could be used as a suitable instrument to regulate which one of them is positive and greatly correlated with the obtained yield of white sugar it was noticed that white sugar yield positive and strongly correlated with root yield then followed by root weight which validates their economic importance results in table 9 show that root yield in both seasons was significantly p 0 01 contributed to variations in white sugar yield 4 conclusion drought stress significantly reduced plant water status physiological responses and growth characteristics of sugar beet plants however the application of novel compost could overcome the injurious effects of water deficit by increasing plant water status spad value chlorophyll fluorescence plant growth attributes and irrigation use efficiency in this instance nc appeared to be a viable substitute to reduce soil ph soil salinity ece and bulk density and increase available water total porosity useful pores water holding pores and om results showed that nc of 10 t ha 1 and 20 t ha 1 significantly improved root yield by 27 8 and 49 8 also white sugar yield increased by 34 7 and 65 5 and reduced cd uptake by 21 2 and 34 7 for leaves and by 34 6 and 57 7 for roots compared to untreated soil nc0 0 t ha 1 depending on the results of the present study it could be concluded that the treatment i100 nc20 is the most suitable for producing the highest yields under the conditions of the study area under water scarcity application of i80 nc20 treatment was found to be favorable to save 20 of the applied irrigation water providing the same white sugar yield our results suggest that nc applications may find value as a potential growth stimulant for improving plant growth and productivity under deficit irrigation declaration of competing interest no potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors 
10849,supplying novel compost 70 30 w w sugarcane bagasse and animal blood used as composting raw materials under deficit drip irrigation conditions could be a practical solution to avoid the detrimental effects of irrigation shortage on sugar beet grown in cadmium cd contaminated salty soil in this regard two experiments were conducted in open field during 2016 17 and 2017 18 at el fayoum region egypt three novel compost nc rates 0 10 and 20 t ha 1 were supplied as a soil amendment combined with three irrigation levels 100 80 and 60 of crop evapotranspiration etc the nc improved soil properties and reduced leaves and roots cd uptake sugar beet yield quality and irrigation use efficiency iue were positively affected by irrigation regime and by nc rates leaf area dry matter relative

in particular increased root yield by 53 49 and 15 93 compared to control the results revealed that the detrimental impacts of drought stress can be greatly reduced by using nc as a soil amendment for sugar beet production the results also revealed combining deficit irrigation and nc maximized crop water productivity keywords sugar beet soil properties plant water status physiology photosynthetic efficiency irrigation use efficiency 1 introduction sugar beet is considered as a significant sugar crop which approximately provides about 35 of global sugar needs and widely cultivated especially in dry and semi dry districts wu et al 2013 globally in 2016 the productivity of sugar beet approximately amounted 266 8 million ton which produced from 4 47 million hectares by average root yield of 59 6 ton per hectare faostat 2016 crop productivity is extremely affected by various abiotic stressors such as metals contamination salinity and drought abbasi et al 2016 abd el mageed et al 2018 cadmium

biochemical responses via osmotic and ionic stressors in plants rady et al 2018 generally salinity stress reduces mineral supplement take up plant development and biomass semida et al 2016 sugar beet growth plants showed tolerance to salt stress depending on the growth stage or cultivar hills et al 1990 sugar industry in egypt is based on both sugar beet and sugar cane crops sugar beet is considered as one of the main strategic crops contributing of approximately 50 in the net egyptian sugar production 1 255 million tons faostat 2016 however egypt experiences difficulties to narrow the gap between sugar production and its consumption which reaches about one million ton year abu zaida 2014 in mediterranean area one of these attempts was to increase sugar beet productivity nowadays egypt is facing several challenges such as drought and natural aridity desertification and water shortage caused by the human being and climate change kang et al 2017 in this regard developing technical practices and applying the innovative water saving technologies should be presented for increasing yield and quality of sugar beet the greatest water consuming sector is irrigated agriculture about 80 of worldwide fresh water which faces competing demands from other sectors sander and bastiaanssen 2004 therefore the core contest of the agricultural division is how to use less water for producing more food which could be achieved by enhancing water use efficiency deficit irrigation di established in agriculture to develop irrigation water efficiency sadras 2009 sepaskhah and ahmadi 2010 the di is a valuable production technique generally used under water deficiency conditions badal et al 2013 ramazan et al 2014 and agami et al 2018 the cultivation of sugar beet in sandy loam soil revealed that the yield and sucrose content were higher under trickle irrigation system compared to furrow irrigation sharmasarkar et al 2001 tognetti et al 2002 examined the performance of sugar beet planted under five irrigation water regimes control not irrigated 50 75 100 and 120 of etc he found that yield of roots and sucrose percentage were higher with increasing the volume of the applied irrigation water whereas the non watered plants produced the lowest technological yield characteristics it has been demonstrated by many research groups that water deficits caused a series of deterioration of physio morphological characteristics of sugar beet plants shaw et al 2002 mahmoodi et al 2008 and yonts 2011 therefore increase crop yield under drought stress is considered as the main aim via crossbreeding or genetic engineering programs cattivelli et al 2008 to tackle this problem conventionally chemical treatment and agronomical crop management practices have been applied to decrees the detrimental effects of water deficiency manivannan et al 2007 alternatively compost as organic fertilization plays an essential role in diminishing the utilization of

resulted in promoting of plant growth and increasing of crop yield gosling et al 2006 rajaa and saadi 2011 abd el mageed et al 2018 improvement of soil aggregation could be rationally attributed to its effects on moisture soil content aeration temperature and physical impedance impacts on the growth of roots and seedling emergence ferreras et al 2000 in this concern mahmoud et al 2012 examined the effects of application of three compost levels 0 2 5 and 5 t ha 1 on the productivity of sugar beet and reported that increasing compost addition rate from 0 to 5 t ha1 increased root and sugar yields by 16 4 and 27 8 respectively in this study animal blood contains high percentage of protein macro and micro nutrients has been mixed with sugarcane bagasse sugarcane bagasse sb contains organic carbon total fibers these components enrich the compost in favor of the growing plants through improving of the soil characteristics physical and chemical as a result the content of nutrients will increase and easily uptaken by growing plants leading to noticeable increase of growth and productivity of sugar beet however the studies detailed with the suitability of composting blood animals with sugarcane bagasse and its utility as a favorable source for organic matter are very limited owing to considerable evidence of the adverse influences of abiotic stressors on plant growth it was hypothesized that the novel compost used in our investigation as a soil amendment can overcome the deleterious impacts of stresses on sugar beet plants thus one of the main objectives of this study was to examine whether the novel compost could alleviate the effects of water deficit on the plants furthermore it is important to test also its impacts on growth yield sugar yield and its quality by adjusting the soil moisture content plant water status and morpho physiological responses 2 methodology 2 1 experiment design and location we conducted two experiments during two growing seasons from

the cultural disease pest management and fertilization program were the same as local commercial sugar beet production 2 6 physiological measurements as described by maxwell and johnson 2000 and spoustová et al 2013 chlorophyll fluorescence fv fm was measured by using handy pea hansatech instruments ltd kings lynn uk the pi was measured as reported by clark et al 2000 the rwc of the fully expanded fresh leaf was determined using hayat et al 2007 method while msi was determined according to rady 2011 the leaf chlorophyll concentration spad value was measured by spad502 konicaminolta inc tokyo 2 7 determination of cd2 the contents of cd2 leaves and roots were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry perkin elmer model 3300 as described by chapman and pratt 1961 2 8 yield yield component and irrigation use efficiency at harvest randomly ten plants were collected from each plot then separated into tops and roots root lengths diameters and weights were estimated using a meter scale and digital balance to measure root and biological yields plants of each plot were harvested harvest index hi was calculated on a dry mass basis by using the following formula hi yield of

iue root yield kg h a 1 water applied m 3 h a 1 2 9 statistical analysis we analyzed the data statistically using the genstat computer software package version 11 vsn international ltd oxford uk 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of the novel compost application on some soil properties novel compost nc applied to the soil showed noticeable impacts on its physiochemical properties where soil ph and soil electrical conductivity ece strongly affected p 0 05 by increasing the rates of nc table 4 this could be possibly attributed to the increasing of cation exchange capacity cec 41 3 and the accumulation of active organic acids of nc which led to a reduction in ph values moreover the ph of the novel compost has an acidic effect 6 44 table 3 resulted in a decrease of soil ph the ece reduction may be due to the existence of the charged sites i e coo accounts for the capability of the nc to chelate and retain cations in non active formulas abd el mageed et al 2016 and 2018 and semida et al 2014 also lower ec of the nc 2 98 ds m 1 table 3 contributed to moderate the soil ece moreover nc applications at rates of 10 and 20 t ha 1 significantly increased the om content of studied soil also it was noted that a steady decrease in the determined of soil bulk density values with increasing nc rates where the lowest measured b d value 1 52 g cm 3 was associated to the maximum addition 20 t ha 1 nc such behavior may refer to the effective role of colloidal particles of organic matter on soil particles rearrangement and modifying pore spaces distribution pattern which caused an increase in the bulk volume and hence decreased the bulk density and increase the total porosity of soil these results are in line with the previous studies of abd el mageed et al 2018 and abd el mageed and semida 2015 who demonstrated that bulk density was very associated to solid phase properties and pore size distribution also compared to control when the soil supplemented by 20 t ha 1 of nc the total porosity water holding pores useful pores were also increased by 6 6 25 12 and 19 46 as average for two years respectively the further positive effect of nc at the highest rate was observed on soil moisture relationships where field capacity and available water content improved by 15 and 25 12 respectively the above mentioned case could be attributed to the increased whc of nc 7 21 g water g nc and also increased total fibers 29 4 table 3 it is very likely the utilization of nc activated the creation processes of medium and or micropores between simple packing and sand particles resulting in an increase in capillary potential moreover the released organic substances have a great ability to maintain a pronounced content of soil water accordingly these findings and statements are consistent with those documented by cheng et al 1998 semida et al 2014 semida et al 2015 and rady et al 2016b who noted that active organic materials greatly decreased the loss of soil moisture and ameliorated the water retention the nc positively affected on the properties of saline soil e i aeration permeability aggregation and whc and led to preserve the appropriate of soil water content and hence increased the activity of the invulnerable plant system 3 2 growth characteristics irrigation novel compost treatments and the impacts of their interactions on growth attributes are presented in table 5 growth parameters strongly affected by the irrigation regime the greatest values of root length 29 6 cm root diameter 16 39 cm leaves number 79 20 plant 1 dry matter 724 g and leaves area 1084 dm2 were observed and recorded under 100 of iwa on the other hand increasing water stress level to 60 etc reduced these traits by 13 85 17 69 32 51 36 42 and 37 03 respectively these results clarify that increasing soil moisture availability in the root zone by applying irrigation at i100 may enhance plants to assimilate more water which caused an increase in photosynthesis activity cells division and cells enlargement our results are in concurrence with those documented by abayomi and wright 2002 kiziloglu et al 2006 and mahmoodi et al 2008 who noticed that water shortage in the early stage of the sugar beet pronounce a negative effect on leaf growth rate of leaf extension area of individual leaf and leaf area index abo shady et al 2010 revealed that prolonging drought period increased root length while it decreased root yield and root diameter sabreen et al 2018 observed that when sugar beet watered at the level of 50 etc root length root diameter and roots yield were negatively affected in our study the unfavorable effect of drought stress on these studied traits was declined by the suppling of nc table 5 in addition the application of nc from zero control to 20 t ha 1 positively increased root length root diameter leaves number dry matter and leaves area by 17 81 15 14 26 88 24 11 and 41 50 respectively these findings may be referred to the ameliorative effect of nc application on improving soil physico chemical properties soil water relationships enhanced root elongation and consequently increased water and nutrient uptake by plants which may indirectly reflect on increasing root cells division and enlargement and whole vegetation growth these results are consistent hegazi 2004 berhanu et al 2013 and sabreen and mansour 2015 in summary the data presented clearly substantiates the findings that the best values of growth parameters achieved at irrigation level 100 of etc combined with 20 t ha 1 of nc 3 3 plant water status effects of novel compost nc and water stress on msi and rwc values are presented in table 6 statistical analysis carried out on msi and rwc shows a significant variance p 0 05 between season and both nc and deficit irrigation treatments with increasing water stress msi and rwc were decreased however applying of nc was found to alter the iwa affected msi and rwc the highest values for such parameters resulted from the application of nc20 i100 treatment the rwc and msi are indicators of plant water status semida et al 2017 rwc refers to the plant water content and it has been used as a meaningful index of dehydration tolerance while the msi indicates the integrity of cell membranes likewise it has been generally utilized as an indicator of leaf desiccation tolerance abd el mageed et al 2018 a relationship was recorded between rwc and sugar beet biomass fresh and dry weight under the combined effect of deficit irrigation and nc indicating that plant water status is mostly dependent on the corresponding shoot biomass this also suggested that plants having greater biomass can retain higher water content in leaf and thus can be more tolerant to abiotic stress e i drought salinity and cadmium toxicity according to kabir et al 2004 and abd el mageed et al 2018 crops having greater fresh biomass can maintain higher water content in leaf leading to more tolerance to abiotic stress 3 4 chlorophyll fluorescence and chlorophyll relative index spad value the combined effects of nc and iwa on chlorophyll fluorescence fv fm performance index pi and chlorophyll relative index spad value were shown in table 6 these traits were significantly decreased gradually with the gradual increase in irrigation regime overall growing seasons si 2016 17 and sii 2017 18 nevertheless suppling of nc has been shown to alleviate the damaging effects of abiotic stresses on fv fm pi and spad values the maximum values of fv fm pi and spad were recorded when plants irrigated well i100 combined with 20 t ha 1 of nc furthermore the minimum values of fv fm pi and spad were observed under i60 0 t ha 1of nc treatment higher fv fm pi and spad produced higher root fresh weight kg root yield tha 1 and consequently increase white sugar yield tables 5 and 6 many studies suggested that chlorophyll fluorescence analysis may be used as a dependable method to measure the changes in the function of psii under various stress conditions habibi 2012 the photosynthetic activity reduction might be a result of low photochemical efficiency of psii as exposed by its lower quantum yield abd el mageed et al 2017 our results recorded reductions in fv fm pi and spad under di stress conditions which were possibly due to the reduction in leaf photosynthetic pigments and rwc table 6 needed for photosynthesis the results are parallel with those of habibi 2012 isopp et al 2000 and rady et al 2016a used a differ compost and found that compost have favored leaf growth and a new sink developed which would decrease soluble carbohydrates photosynthesis is also highly responded to the plant s water supply numerous studies documented that the disruption of water flow can cause a reduction in water content in assimilation tissue in turn leads to photosynthetic depression fahim et al 2014 abd el mageed et al 2017 semida et al 2017 3 5 cd concentration application of novel compost nc at a rate of 10 or 20 t ha 1 showed significant decreases p 0 05 in the concentrations of cd2 in leaves and roots of plant grown in cd contaminated soil compared to the unamended soil fig 1 although cd2 is a non essential element for plants it is easily uptake by plants growing on cd2 contaminated or soils cd2 supplemented entering the food chain and causing harm to plant and human health kabata pendias and pendias 2001 fig 1 showed that plants grown in cd2 contaminated soil received 10 and or 20 ton nc per hectare have lower concentrations of cd by 24 9 and 35 7 for leaves and by 37 9 and 59 for roots as average for both seasons as compared with control 0 t h 1 the availability of cd to plants was reduced by nc application maybe due to the surface adsorption and precipitation of novel compost reduction of cd content in leaves and roots probably due to the surface functional groups and adsorption sites on novel compost which could increase cec of the studied soil and consequently increase soil cd exchange capacity through the creation of complexes with cationic metals the reduction of cd uptake leaves or and roots grown in amended soil with nc probably due to the highly porous structure of nc active functional groups and cation exchange capacity cec moreover the indirect effect of nc on properties of soil physical and chemical consequently impact on cd retention or release these findings are in accordance with those of eissa 2018 pandit et al 2012 and rady et al 2016b 3 6 yields harvest index and irrigation use efficiency root fresh weight plant root yield t ha 1 biomass yield and harvest index hi significantly increased and recorded maximum values table 7 under fully irrigated i100 for harvest index hi no differences between i100 and i80 were found on the other hand when plants subjected to the severe irrigation regime 60 these traits were reduced by 47 12 31 44 37 57 and 4 76 respectively table 7 these results were confirmed by noghabi and williams 2000 who noted that stress occurs during early stages of growth may negatively affect root growth and resulted in yield loss by 46 masri et al 2015 showed that root yield strongly increased by increasing irrigation water requirement from 50 up to 75 and 100 also mohamed et al 2018 concluded that rwc and stomatal conductance for sugar beet plants were decreased under water stress and consequently growth and yield of sugar beet were decreased also it was recorded that applying 20 t ha 1 of nc caused a significant improvement in the above mentioned parameters wael et al 2015 noted that application of inorganic and bio organic fertilizers affected the plant growth components under the semi arid zone the highest sugar yield was obtained under 20 t ha1 of nc i100 and the lowest value achieved under 0 t ha1 of nc i60 table7 according to fig 2 it could be expressed between irrigation water applied iwa and root yield ry by using the following relationship polynomial of 2nd order ry 7e 06 x iwa2 0 0502 x iwa 134 2 r² 0 85 for si 2016 17 ry 1e 07x iwa2 0 0112 x iwa 15 534 r2 0 91 for sii 2017 18 where ry is the root yield t ha 1 and iwa is irrigation water applied m3 ha 1 moreover the obtained results demonstrated that the most severed irrigating regime i60 produced the lower root yields it provided the higher iue value by 15 51 which decreased by 13 79 when compared with that recorded under i100 compared with control applying nc at its maximum rate 20 t ha 1 increased soil capacity to retain water and consequently increased iue by 53 61 as shown in fig 2 the relationship between iwa and iue was curvilinear polynomial of 2nd order and it could be expressed as follows iue 2e 06 x iwa2 0 0137x iwa 41 081 r² 0 69 for si 2016 17 iue 1e 07 x iwa2 0 0019 x iwa 20 384 r2 0 82 for sii 2017 18 where iue is the root irrigation use efficiency kg m 3 and iwa is irrigation water applied m3 ha 1 generally the highest values of iue were obtained under i60 this result is in line with that of nourjou 2008 esmaeili 2011 topak et al 2011 ghamarnia et al 2012 3 7 white sugar yield impurities and purity results in table 8 showed that drip irrigated plants with 100 etc produced highest white sugar yield 15 38 t ha 1 and α amino n 1 28 moreover applying the adequate irrigation treatment i100 caused an increase in both of sugar lose yield 2 9 t ha 1 and white sugar 15 38 t ha 1 where percentage of purity 83 47 was the lowest value as compared to i60 reduction in sugar yield under severe water deficit regime probably due to the lower root yield table 7 masri et al 2015 mentioned that technological attributes sucrose purity and extractable sugar with increasing water stress additionally the above studied traits significantly responded to a novel compost applying 20 t ha 1 of nc positively increased white sugar yield and purity by 65 5 and 3 23 respectively and significantly reduced α amino n and sugar lost yield by 11 and 12 20 compared with control respectively these findings agrees with hosseinpour et al 2006 mahmoud et al 2012 and tognetti et al 2003 who observed that applying 20 t ha 1 of organic compost significantly produced the greatest leave area and the highest root yield and improved the quality of juice traits sucrose extractable sugar and purity 3 8 correlation analysis data presented in tables 9 and 10 showed the correlation coefficients between sugar beet productivity from white sugar and the other yield components this kind of analysis could be used as a suitable instrument to regulate which one of them is positive and greatly correlated with the obtained yield of white sugar it was noticed that white sugar yield positive and strongly correlated with root yield then followed by root weight which validates their economic importance results in table 9 show that root yield in both seasons was significantly p 0 01 contributed to variations in white sugar yield 4 conclusion drought stress significantly reduced plant water status physiological responses and growth characteristics of sugar beet plants however the application of novel compost could overcome the injurious effects of water deficit by increasing plant water status spad value chlorophyll fluorescence plant growth attributes and irrigation use efficiency in this instance nc appeared to be a viable substitute to reduce soil ph soil salinity ece and bulk density and increase available water total porosity useful pores water holding pores and om results showed that nc of 10 t ha 1 and 20 t ha 1 significantly improved root yield by 27 8 and 49 8 also white sugar yield increased by 34 7 and 65 5 and reduced cd uptake by 21 2 and 34 7 for leaves and by 34 6 and 57 7 for roots compared to untreated soil nc0 0 t ha 1 depending on the results of the present study it could be concluded that the treatment i100 nc20 is the most suitable for producing the highest yields under the conditions of the study area under water scarcity application of i80 nc20 treatment was found to be favorable to save 20 of the applied irrigation water providing the same white sugar yield our results suggest that nc applications may find value as a potential growth stimulant for improving plant growth and productivity under deficit irrigation declaration of competing interest no potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors
