16305,bromate a regulated disinfection byproduct forms during the ozonation of bromide through reactions with both ozone and hydroxyl radical in this study preformed monochloramine was evaluated for use as a bromate suppression method in pilot testing of wastewater reuse with an average bromide concentration of 422 20 µg l a dose of 3 mg l nh2cl cl2 decreased bromate formation by an average of 82 and was sufficient to keep bromate below the mcl at ozone doses up to 8 6 mg l 1 2 o3 toc removal of 1 4 dioxane through ozonation decreased with increasing nh2cl dose confirming that monochloramine suppresses bromate formation at least in part by acting as a hydroxyl radical scavenger this may negatively impact oxidation objectives of ozonation in reuse applications increasing monochloramine contact time did not improve bromate suppression indicating that monochloramine probably did not mask bromide as nhbrcl or other haloamines prior to ozonation however nhbrcl and nh2br may be formed from reactions between hobr and nh2cl and excess free ammonia during ozonation ndma was formed by ozonation at concentrations up to 79 ng l and was not enhanced by nh2cl addition keywords ozonation bromate potable reuse 1 4 dioxane 1 introduction and background ozonation coupled with biofiltration has recently emerged as a promising alternative to membrane based processes for potable reuse applications this process offers significant cost savings in terms of both capital and operating costs as well as eliminating the need to handle concentrated brine streams which are a concern for inland locations gerrity et al 2014 in this process ozone provides bulk organics degradation assimilable organic carbon aoc generation and transforms trace organic contaminants torcs into more readily biodegradable transformation products while also providing a barrier against pathogens arnold et al 2018 knopp et al 2016 reungoat et al 2012 wert et al 2007 ozone is a powerful oxidant which also leads to the generation of hydroxyl oh and other radicals through reactions with dissolved organic matter dom hydroxyl radical is nonselective and extremely fast reacting while transient concentrations and exposures are very low it is considered the strongest oxidant available for water treatment ozone decomposition follows multiphasic kinetics in the initial phase t 30 s rapid ozone decomposition takes place due to fast direct reactions with organics that generate large amounts of oh after the most reactive dom has been consumed the ozone decay rate stabilizes in the second phase and can be approximated by first order decay kinetics von gunten 2003a due to the higher concentration and reactivity of the organic matter in wastewater effluent ozonation can generate hydroxyl radical concentrations greater than those found in advanced oxidation process aop applications in natural waters buffle et al 2006 bromate bro3 is formed through the ozonation of bromide containing waters and is the primary disinfection byproduct dbp of ozonation a maximum contaminant level for bromate of 10 µg l was set by the usepa following a world health organization report which classified it as a potential human carcinogen epa 1998 who 1993 conventional drinking water treatment wisdom states that bromate formation may be an issue if bromide concentrations are greater than 50 µg l von gunten 2003b bromate is formed through a complex series of both ozone and hydroxyl radical reactions fig 1 pinkernell and von gunten 2001 in the direct pathway ozone oxidizes bromide to hypobromous acid hobr only obr is then further oxidized by ozone to form bro2 and bro3 in the direct indirect pathway hobr and obr react with hydroxyl radical to form bro which disproportionates to bro2 which is then oxidized to bro3 the majority of bromate formation occurs through this pathway during drinking water treatment conditions qi et al 2016 von gunten 2003b the indirect direct pathway is most important during the initial phase where hydroxyl radical concentrations are highest and is likely responsible for much of the bromate formation in wastewater ozonation in this pathway bromide is radicalized by oh reacts with ozone to form bro and then proceeds following the latter half of the direct indirect pathway pinkernell and von gunten 2001 qi et al 2016 soltermann et al 2017 there are several common chemical bromate control strategies ph suppression shifts the hobr obr equilibrium towards hypobromous acid thus decreasing bromate formation through the direct pathways as well as possibly decreasing oh generation hydrogen peroxide addition rapidly converts ozone into oh decreasing overall ozone exposure and can also catalytically reduce hypobromous acid von gunten and oliveras 1998 ammonia can be added to form bromamine nh2br from hypobromous acid which masks bromide from further oxidation table 1 reaction 1 in the chlorine ammonia process free chlorine is used to pre oxidize bromide to hypobromous acid then ammonia is added to mask bromide as nh2br prior to ozonation monochloramine may also be formed from excess free chlorine and acts as a radical scavenger table 1 reaction 3 as such the nh3 cl2 has also been used to control bromate hydroxyl radical scavenging was hypothesized to be the primary benefit of monochloramine over ammonia addition alone buffle et al 2004 similar to ammonia monochloramine can react with hobr to form bromochloramine nhbrcl table 1 reaction 2 recently ling et al 2020 claimed that bromochloramine and dibromamine nhbr2 were formed prior to ozonation table 1 reactions 4 and 5 in the nh3 cl2 process six minutes of monochloramine contact time was provided to mask the majority of bromide as nhbrcl and nhbr2 these compounds were also found to be more resistant to ozonation than nh2br hampton roads sanitation district s hrsd swift research center src is a 3 8 mld demonstration scale advanced water treatment facility located in suffolk virginia the facility treats secondary effluent from the nansemond treatment plant 5 stage bardenpho process with methanol addition to drinking water standards for recharge into the potomac aquifer the treatment train consists of coagulation flocculation and sedimentation followed by ozonation biofiltration granular activated carbon adsorption and uv disinfection the facility also houses a similarly configured pilot scale 4 l min treatment plant for experimental work due to the low lying coastal nature of hrsd s collection system bromide concentrations of 400 µg l or higher are often present due to saltwater infiltration as well as specific industrial sources such as landfill leachate during initial testing ph suppression was found to be impractical on the pilot scale and cost prohibitive for full scale implementation due to the high alkalinity in the wastewater effluent data not shown hydrogen peroxide was not considered due to the project requirement to achieve an ozone residual for disinfection ct credit ammonia addition was tested briefly but could not effectively keep bromate below the mcl buehlmann et al 2017 preformed monochloramine where monochloramine is formed using sodium hypochlorite and ammonium sulfate fed into softened carrier water was selected for bromate control this was chosen due to the ease of control and decreased chemical demand over the nh3 cl2 or cl2 nh3 with somewhat variable nh4 and no2 in the wastewater effluent and the desire to minimize production of free chlorine dbps when nh4 is low preformed monochloramine also decreases the possibility of n nitrosodimethylamine ndma formation by dichloramine hogard et al 2021 mitch et al 2005 schreiber and mitch 2005 of particular concern is 1 4 dioxane a trace contaminant and potential human carcinogen commonly found in wastewater effluents due to its use in industry and household supplies such as detergents tanabe and kawata 2008 influent concentrations typically range from 0 5 to 1 µg l at the swift research center and it has a 10 6 lifetime cancer risk associated with a concentration of 0 35 µg l epa 2013 it is not readily biodegradable or well adsorbed and through ozonation it is only removed by oh oxidation in which case radical scavenging by nh2cl may decrease its removal hogard et al 2021 the objectives of this study were to determine the efficacy of preformed monochloramine for bromate control during ozonation of a high bromide reuse water secondary effects of monochloramine addition on oh exposure ozone demand decay and disinfection credit were also analyzed as well as ndma formation through ozonation while determining the mechanisms of bromate suppression by monochloramine was not the objective of this study results and the implications on treatment performance were analyzed in light of these mechanisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant description pilot tests were conducted at hrsd s src at the nansemond treatment plant suffolk va nansemond treatment plant is a 114 mld 30 mgd fully nitrifying and denitrifying plant utilizing a 5 stage bardenho treatment process with methanol addition for denitrification 3 8 mld 1 mgd of the secondary clarifier effluent is fed into the src the treatment train includes coagulation flocculation and sedimentation followed by ozonation biofiltration granular activated carbon adsorption and uv disinfection prior to deep well aquifer recharge the plant operation has been described extensively elsewhere hogard et al 2021 settled water from the src was fed to a pilot feed tank with a chiller to control the temperature to 20 0 8 c however for each test temperature stayed within a 1 c range influent water quality is summarized in table 2 a pipeline chloramine contactor was used upstream of the ozonation pilot to test the effects of monochloramine contact time as shown in figure 2 the ozone pilot used was a modified intuitech 2nd generation ozone pilot intuitech inc salt lake city usa operated at 3 94 l min the pilot ozone contactor consisted of one counter current dissolution column with a retention time of 1 5 min followed by five contact columns also with a retention time of 1 5 min each each of the contact columns had a series of sample ports to measure ozone residuals along the contactor ozone was generated from oxygen from the onboard oxygen concentrator ozone gas concentrations ranged from 3 4 to 9 8 w w as the lowest ozone doses required the gas flow rates to be increased for the oxygen ozone mass flow controllers to control the dose well measured ozone transfer efficiency was 99 however in the above configuration the gas flow rates 0 15 0 3 slpm were below the optimal gas flow rates for the off gas analyzer in previous testing with higher gas flow rates and lower gas concentrations transfer efficiency was still typically 95 applied ozone doses were selected by taking a grab sample for toc and nitrite and adjusting the dose for the desired o3 toc ratio all o3 toc ratios referenced herein are nitrite corrected a toc sample was also collected and sent to hrsd s central environmental laboratory at the beginning of each test the grab samples on the online instrument shimadzu toc 4200 were found to read slightly higher than the laboratory instrument so the lab values were used influent uv absorbance changed by less than 5 over the course of each testing day so toc was assumed to be constant for each test fig 2 preformed monochloramine stock was collected from the preformed monochloramine system at the src in this system tap water is fed through gac to dechlorinate and remove toc which then followed by softening via ion exchange sodium hypochlorite followed by ammonium sulfate are then added to the carrier water using static mixers the carrier water flow rate is set to target a 50x dilution to prevent heat buildup and chemicals are dosed for a 4 5 1 cl2 n ratio for optimal monochloramine formation monochloramine stock was collected daily during testing and fed using a peristaltic pump which was calibrated each time the chloramine addition point was changed monochloramine stock was kept on ice to prevent decay and used within four hours of collection the stock concentration was measured each time it was collected and at the end of each testing day never decaying more than 5 2 2 analytical methods monochloramine total chlorine and free ammonia were measured using a hach sl1000 portable parallel analyzer hach loveland co total ammonia nitrite and nitrate were measured by tnt methods 830 839 and 835 respectively and quantified on a hach dr 3900 spectrophotometer ozone residuals were measured by the gravimetric indigo method standard methods 4500b o3 with malonic acid addition to mask and free chlorine from chloramination or any oxidized bromide species which may be present indigo absorbance at 600 nm as well as uv254 absorbance of the water samples were measured on a genesys 180 uv vis spectrophotometer thermo scientific waltham ma bromide and bromate were analyzed by ion chromatography via epa methods 300 and 300 1 respectively bromate samples were preserved with eda in order to calculate total organic bromine tobr ozone effluent bromide samples were also collected the effluent bromide concentration was corrected for the bromide converted to bromate and compared to the influent after the method of buffle et al 2004 ozone effluent bromide samples were quenched with 2 mm sodium bisulfite within one minute of sample collection ndma and 1 4 dioxane were measured on an agilent 7010b gc ms triple quadrupole by epa methods 521 and 522 with some slight modification notably both samples were collected it the same 500 ml sample container preserved with 50 mg l sodium sulfite and 1 g l sodium bisulfate to dechlorinate and acidify the sample magnesium sulfate was used in place of sodium sulfate to dry the extract other slight deviations were as reported by vaidya et al 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 bromate formation without monochloramine addition bromate formation increased from 0 3 to 39 9 µg l by increasing the ozone dose from 0 31 to 1 18 o3 toc 3 75 to 9 6 mg l applied o3 as shown in fig 3 bromide conversion to bromate of 2 9 at 0 86 o3 toc is in line with the bench testing results reported by soltermann et al 2016 with monochloramine addition immediately before ozonation bromate formation was decreased by as much as 90 with 5 mg l cl2 nh2cl a dose of 1 mg l nh2cl reduced bromate formation by 68 on average while 3 and 5 mg l decreased it by 84 and 87 respectively increasing monochloramine contact time to 8 min had no effect on bromate control and is discussed further below at the lowest ozone doses targeting 0 3 o3 toc there was no dose response observed all bromate values were 1 µg l between monochloramine and bromate formed in these tests there was very little measured ozone residual in the effluent of the dissolution column other studies have shown very little bro3 formation at ozone doses below 0 4 o3 toc as there is very little ozone available to oxidize br and hobr obr to form bromate soltermann et al 2016 as shown in figs 3and 4 there was minimal improvement in bromate by increasing monochloramine dose from 3 to 5 mg l similar to both ammonia addition and the chlorine ammonia based strategies preformed monochloramine addition likely has a point of diminishing return where increasing dose has limited or no effect on controlling the bromate formation process buffle et al 2004 pinkernell and von gunten 2001 the location of this point is most likely water quality dependent benotti et al 2011 saw no additional bromate suppression from increasing nh2cl from 1 mg l to 2 mg l while ikehata et al 2013 observed a significant improvement interestingly ikehata et al had 35 lower bromide but higher ph and toc which may have increased their oh generation and bromate formation for similar ozone doses while some water quality parameters fluctuated over the course of testing mainly no2 it is assumed that the nature and reactivity of dom did not change 3 2 monochloramine as a oh scavenger 1 4 dioxane removal decreased from 49 to 33 by increasing monochloramine dose from 0 to 5 mg l at a fixed ozone dose of 7 mg l fig 4 this demonstrates that monochloramine is acting as a hydroxyl radical scavenger as 1 4 dioxane is ozone resistant and only removed by oh ko3 1 m 1s 1 k oh 3 109 m 1s 1 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 this is particularly important for wastewater ozonation where more bromate is formed through the indirect oh pathways soltermann et al 2017 1 4 dioxane samples were also collected with the control and 5 mg l nh2cl in the test matrix shown in fig 3 and 1 4 dioxane removal decreased by roughly half fig s1 a similar result was observed during ozonation at the 3 8 mld scale by hogard et al 2021 change in uv absorbance at 254 nm has been shown to be a good surrogate measure for oh exposure and 1 4 dioxane removal gerrity et al 2012 wert et al 2009 uv absorbance measurements were taken for all tests and were well correlated with 1 4 dioxane removal these results show that oh scavenging is occurring by monochloramine in all cases figs s2 s4 decreasing hydroxyl radical exposure by as much as 40 percent reduces bromate formation but it may also significantly reduce the oxidation capacity of the system if non biodegradable ozone recalcitrant compounds such as 1 4 dioxane atrazine or meprobamate are an issue or mib and geosmin in drinking water use of monochloramine for bromate suppression may be problematic high ozone doses are often required to get sufficient removal of these compounds in which case monochloramine use for bromate control is counterproductive some compounds with moderate reactivity with ozone such as gemfibrozil and atenolol are removed by both ozone and hydroxyl radicals lee et al 2013 with monochloramine addition ozone dose may need to be increased in order to account for the lower oh exposure to remove these compounds additionally increasing chloramine doses also increase the chemical dose required to quench monochloramine before biofiltration and the addition of nitrogen with preformed monochloramine may require increased nitrogen removal in the wastewater treatment plant to meet total nitrogen or nitrate limits on the other hand many trace organic contaminants are oxidized quickly by molecular ozone at low ozone doses compounds such as diclofenac or sulfamethoxazole with ko3 104 m 1s 1 are primarily removed by ozone despite their high reactivity with oh 3 3 monochloramine contact time increasing monochloramine contact time upstream of ozonation was tested to determine if bromochloramine formation table 1 reaction 4 prior to ozonation further decreases bromate formation two conditions were tested including 1 monochloramine addition directly before the pilot feed pump approximately 10 s before entering the ozone contactor and 2 monochloramine addition eight minutes upstream using a small pipeline contactor for the tests shown in figs 3and 4 eight minutes of chloramine contact prior to ozonation did not result in decreased bromate formation contact times up to 30 min were also tested fig 5 and no decrease in bromate formation was observed ling et al 2020 showed 92 masking of bromide as nhbrcl nhbr2 and nh2br with six minutes of nh3 cl2 pretreatment and even greater with 10 min this was said to be occurring through reactions with nh2cl suggesting preformed monochloramine should behave similarly ideally masking of bromide prior to ozonation would improve bromate suppression allowing the chemical doses to be decreased this would in turn decrease radical scavenging by nh2cl and improve 1 4 dioxane removal however that was not the case for this study luh and mariñas 2014 claimed that the trofe et al 1980 mechanism table 1 reaction 4 was inaccurate and showed that it would take several hours for bromochloramine to form at nh2cl and br concentrations relevant to water treatment ling et al 2020 and luh and mariñas 2014 both use spectrophotometric methods in pure waters however they assume different absorbance peaks for nhbrcl measurement unfortunately in real water samples with the background absorbance of the water matrix these methods are not applicable the dpd total chlorine and indophenol monochloramine methods used in this study cannot distinguish between the various haloamine species in either case there does not appear to be any practical benefit of increasing monochloramine contact time for bromate control in many of the tests figs 3and 4 it appeared that the slight decay in nh2cl over the contact time resulted in decreased bromate suppression at the swift research center preformed monochloramine is added to the ozone sidestream immediately before the venturi injector this effectively doubles the monochloramine dose in the sidestream with a 50 50 sidestream flow split and decreases bromate formation by several µg l data not shown this arrangement would not be feasible with increased monochloramine contact time to the entire flow 3 4 intermediate masking fig 4 shows a significant decrease in bromate formation with the addition of 1 mg l nh2cl followed by a more gradual decrease with increasing dose thereafter 1 4 dioxane removal shows a gradual decrease throughout oh radical exposure calculated using 1 4 dioxane as a probe compound with k oh 3 109 m 1s 1 was decreased by 22 at 1 mg l nh2cl and 41 at 5 mg l nh2cl while bromate was reduced by 56 and 87 percent respectively this suggests that oh radical scavenging is not the only method of bromate suppression by monochloramine while it does not appear that nhbrcl is forming prior to ozonation it can be formed from hobr and nh2cl during ozonation table 1 reaction 2 additionally some free ammonia was always fed with the monochloramine stock solution to ensure only monochloramine was formed therefore nh2br can also be formed during ozonation via reaction 1 table 1 as hobr only reacts with the nonionic form nh3 the effective rate constant between hobr and total ammonia nh3 nh4 at ph 7 is similar to that of bromochloramine formation so both compounds are likely to form as intermediates 3 5 ozone demand decay and disinfection credit fig 6 shows ozone decay with increasing monochloramine dose with a 7 mg l applied ozone dose the first ozone residual measurement was excluded from the decay rate calculations as it does not fit the linearized 1st order ozone decay curves this first point was taken at the outlet of the dissolution column approximately 2 5 s after the ozone diffuser where the initial instantaneous demand phase of ozone decay would not yet be complete increasing monochloramine dose had no effect on ozone decay rate this shows that ozone decay and oh generation is controlled by direct reactions with dom rather than by radical chain reaction and not affected by the addition of a radical scavenger in another study and previous testing with this pilot at a different hrsd treatment plant an increase in ozone decay rate was observed with monochloramine addition pearce et al 2018 benotti et al 2011 this was hypothesized to be due to monochloramine oxidation to nitrate by ozone via reaction 5 in table 1 some monochloramine decay was observed through ozonation data not shown benotti et al 2011 had to increase their ozone dose by approximately 15 percent to achieve the same cryptosporidium ct credit in river water when adding 1 mg l monochloramine however that does not appear to be the case in the present study this indicates that slower reacting compounds with rate constants on the order of 26 m 1s 1 do not control ozone decay rate overall ozone decay rate decreased with increasing ozone dose and was unaffected by monochloramine addition as shown in fig 7 a initial or instantaneous ozone demand iod is operationally defined as the difference between the transferred ozone dose and the measured residual at the outlet of the dissolution column iod increased linearly with increasing dose but decreased as a fraction of the transferred dose fig 7b even at the highest ozone dose iod was still greater than 50 of the transferred ozone dose iod was also unaffected by monochloramine addition as direct reactions with dom control ozone decay during this phase and play a larger role in wastewater ozonation buffle et al 2006 table 3 shows the calculated virus and cryptosporidium log inactivation credits for viruses ct was calculated using the maximum of the single point ct from the measured ozone residual samples multiplied by the retention time from the outlet of the dissolution column to the respective sample port in wastewater with high ozone decay rates the measured single point ct can vary significantly for the same ozone residual profile depending on where the residual is measured even when optimized the single point ct method is extremely conservative and significantly underestimates the true ozone exposure in the system despite this all but the lowest doses tested were sufficient for significant viral inactivation credit as shown in table 3 one log virus credit was given for dissolution column effluent ozone residuals 0 1 mg l for cryptosporidium ct was calculated by integrating the first order ozone residual decay curves this is approximately equivalent to the extended cstr or extended t10 methods typically used to achieve cryptosporidium ct credit rakness et al 2005 a baffle factor of 0 9 was applied in all cases to approximate the pipeline contactor at the src the calculated log inactivation credit from the chemical dose matrix decreases with increasing monochloramine dose however this is likely due to the ozone doses being increased during the control test for nitrite demand which decreased throughout the testing day while monochloramine doses were increased with a fixed ozone dose of 7 mg l 1 07 o3 toc increasing monochloramine dose had no effect on the calculated cryptosporidium lrv hrsd currently operates the ozone system at the swift research center to achieve 3 log virus inactivation credit using a single point ct calculation in a pipeline contactor from these pilot tests this target would be achieved around 0 6 to 0 8 o3 toc which is consistent with full scale operation hogard et al 2021 two log cryptosporidium inactivation credit would require an ozone dose of approximately 1 1 o3 toc when using an integrated ct method a dose of 3 mg l cl2 preformed monochloramine was able to keep bromate below the mcl at ozone doses as high as this in terms of contaminant oxidation ozone doses this high are mostly beneficial for the removal of more ozone recalcitrant compounds whose removal may be negatively affected by hydroxyl radical scavenging by monochloramine unless ozone ct is necessary for a secondary barrier to cryptosporidium it may be easier to achieve this removal elsewhere as many o3 baf based reuse treatment trains utilize membrane filtration or downstream uv disinfection gerrity et al 2013 3 6 ndma and brominated organics fig 8 shows the ozone effluent ndma with and without monochloramine addition these samples were taken during the control and 5 mg l nh2cl conditions shown in figs 3 and s1 ndma formation increased with increasing ozone dose until it plateaued around 0 6 o3 toc which is consistent with previous results on this water and other literature results hogard et al 2021 snyder et al 2015 monochloramine addition did not increase ndma formation while both monochloramine and ozone can form ndma they are formed by distinctly different groups of precursors sgroi et al 2018 many nh2cl ndma precursors are well removed by ozonation lee et al 2007 ndma formation potential tests conducted on this water by vaidya et al 2021 showed an average of 780 ng l ndma formed with 140 mg l cl2 nh2cl after 10 days of contact an ozone dose of 0 6 o3 toc decreased formation potential by approximately 90 in previous testing by hogard et al 2021 increased ozone effluent ndma was observed at 2 mg l o3 with 3 mg l preformed monochloramine this indicated that 2 mg l ozone was insufficient to remove the nh2cl ndma precursors and that monochloramine could form ndma in the eight minute contact time of the ozone contactor however that did not appear to be the case here a dose of 5 mg l cl2 preformed monochloramine was added to the settled water and ndma was sampled over 90 min table s1 no ndma formation was observed which is not unexpected as ndma formation by monochloramine is typically quite slow on the order of days in drinking water distribution systems preforming monochloramine should also minimize the risk of ndma formation by dichloramine schreiber mitch 2006 even at the lowest ozone doses ndma was greater than most drinking water regulatory limits of 10 ng l indicating that removal by downstream biofiltration or uv photolysis would be required the formation of brominated organic disinfection byproducts is also a concern with chlorination and chloramination of bromide containing waters though most of these compounds are unregulated they are thought to be more toxic than their chlorinated counterparts sharma et al 2014 buffle et al 2004 showed significant total organic bromine tobr formed during the cl2 nh3 process as much as 30 of the of the initial bromide ended up as tobr and this was reduced to approximately 15 with increased background ammonia causing nh2cl formation in this study effluent bromide was measured on select samples with ozonation and chloramination table s2 tobr estimated as missing bromide between the ozone influent and effluent and corrected for bromate was always less than 5 which is well within the range of analytical error and influent bromide fluctuation brominated organic formation does not appear to be a concern here similar to ndma formation it may take more time for these compounds to form ozonated samples were quenched with bisulfite within one minute of sample collection giving a maximum contact time of 8 min with monochloramine plus 10 min through the ozone contactor and sample collection bromide samples were also collected with ndma with up to 90 min of monochloramine contact time table s1 and again no brominated organic formation was observed at least within the sensitivity of the difference in the bromate corrected bromide concentrations 4 conclusions with a bromide concentration of 414 µg l bromate exceeded the mcl of 10 µg l at specific ozone doses greater than 0 7 o3 toc monochloramine doses of 3 or 5 mg l cl2 nh2cl were able to control bromate formation to below the mcl at ozone doses up to 1 2 1 o3 toc and suppress bromate formation by as much as 90 there was little improvement by increasing the monochloramine dose from 3 to 5 mg l cl2 monochloramine is acting as a hydroxyl radical scavenger as evidenced by diminished 1 4 dioxane removal with increasing monochloramine dose use of monochloramine is a tradeoff between radical scavenging for bromate control and decreased removal of ozone resistant compounds which are removed through oh oxidation alone removal of the most ozone reactive trace contaminants should be unaffected use of monochloramine for bromate control should come with serious evaluation of oxidation objectives increasing monochloramine contact time upstream of ozonation did not improve bromate control indicating that bromide is not being masked as haloamines prior to ozonation monochloramine should be added as soon before ozonation as possible as monochloramine decay over longer contact times appeared to decrease bromate suppression monochloramine addition did not have any effect on ozone demand decay rate or calculated disinfection credit which is counter to previous drinking water results this shows that ozone decay is unaffected by a radical terminator and that slow reactions between ozone and compounds such as monochloramine do not play much of a role in wastewater effluent though this may be water quality dependent ndma formation increased with increasing ozone dose until 0 6 o3 toc where it plateaued at 60 75 ng l ndma formation through ozonation was not affected by monochloramine addition for bromate control it is likely that the short contact time before ozonation is insufficient for ndma formation by monochloramine however the precursors may not have been present during these tests as precursor concentrations can be dependent on the source water and upstream treatment plant operation brominated organic formation does not appear to be a concern through ozonation either with or without

16305,bromate a regulated disinfection byproduct forms during the ozonation of bromide through reactions with both ozone and hydroxyl radical in this study preformed monochloramine was evaluated for use as a bromate suppression method in pilot testing of wastewater reuse with an average bromide concentration of 422 20 µg l a dose of 3 mg l nh2cl cl2 decreased bromate formation by an average of 82 and was sufficient to keep bromate below the mcl at ozone doses up to 8 6 mg l 1 2 o3 toc removal of 1 4 dioxane through ozonation decreased with increasing nh2cl dose confirming that monochloramine suppresses bromate formation at least in part by acting as a hydroxyl radical scavenger this may negatively impact oxidation objectives of ozonation in reuse applications increasing monochloramine contact time did not improve bromate suppression indicating that monochloramine probably did not mask bromide as nhbrcl or other haloamines prior to ozonation however nhbrcl and nh2br may be formed from reactions between hobr and nh2cl and excess free ammonia during ozonation ndma was formed by ozonation at concentrations up to 79 ng l and was not enhanced by nh2cl addition keywords ozonation bromate potable reuse 1 4 dioxane 1 introduction and background ozonation coupled with biofiltration has recently emerged as a promising alternative to membrane based processes for potable reuse applications this process offers significant cost savings in terms of both capital and operating costs as well as eliminating the need to handle concentrated brine streams which are a concern for inland locations gerrity et al 2014 in this process ozone provides bulk organics degradation assimilable organic carbon aoc generation and transforms trace organic contaminants torcs into more readily biodegradable transformation products while also providing a barrier against pathogens arnold et al 2018 knopp et al 2016 reungoat et al 2012 wert et al 2007 ozone is a powerful oxidant which also leads to the generation of hydroxyl oh and other radicals through reactions with dissolved organic matter dom hydroxyl radical is nonselective and extremely fast reacting while transient concentrations and exposures are very low it is considered the strongest oxidant available for water treatment ozone decomposition follows multiphasic kinetics in the initial phase t 30 s rapid ozone decomposition takes place due to fast direct reactions with organics that generate large amounts of oh after the most reactive dom has been consumed the ozone decay rate stabilizes in the second phase and can be approximated by first order decay kinetics von gunten 2003a due to the higher concentration and reactivity of the organic matter in wastewater effluent ozonation can generate hydroxyl radical concentrations greater than those found in advanced oxidation process aop applications in natural waters buffle et al 2006 bromate bro3 is formed through the ozonation of bromide containing waters and is the primary disinfection byproduct dbp of ozonation a maximum contaminant level for bromate of 10 µg l was set by the usepa following a world health organization report which classified it as a potential human carcinogen epa 1998 who 1993 conventional drinking water treatment wisdom states that bromate formation may be an issue if bromide concentrations are greater than 50 µg l von gunten 2003b bromate is formed through a complex series of both ozone and hydroxyl radical reactions fig 1 pinkernell and von gunten 2001 in the direct pathway ozone oxidizes bromide to hypobromous acid hobr only obr is then further oxidized by ozone to form bro2 and bro3 in the direct indirect pathway hobr and obr react with hydroxyl radical to form bro which disproportionates to bro2 which is then oxidized to bro3 the majority of bromate formation occurs through this pathway during drinking water treatment conditions qi et al 2016 von gunten 2003b the indirect direct pathway is most important during the initial phase where hydroxyl radical concentrations are highest and is likely responsible for much of the bromate formation in wastewater ozonation in this pathway bromide is radicalized by oh reacts with ozone to form bro and then proceeds following the latter half of the direct indirect pathway pinkernell and von gunten 2001 qi et al 2016 soltermann et al 2017 there are several common chemical bromate control strategies ph suppression shifts the hobr obr equilibrium towards hypobromous acid thus decreasing bromate formation through the direct pathways as well as possibly decreasing oh generation hydrogen peroxide addition rapidly converts ozone into oh decreasing overall ozone exposure and can also catalytically reduce hypobromous acid von gunten and oliveras 1998 ammonia can be added to form bromamine nh2br from hypobromous acid which masks bromide from further oxidation table 1 reaction 1 in the chlorine ammonia process free chlorine is used to pre oxidize bromide to hypobromous acid then ammonia is added to mask bromide as nh2br prior to ozonation monochloramine may also be formed from excess free chlorine and acts as a radical scavenger table 1 reaction 3 as such the nh3 cl2 has also been used to control bromate hydroxyl radical scavenging was hypothesized to be the primary benefit of monochloramine over ammonia addition alone buffle et al 2004 similar to ammonia monochloramine can react with hobr to form bromochloramine nhbrcl table 1 reaction 2 recently ling et al 2020 claimed that bromochloramine and dibromamine nhbr2 were formed prior to ozonation table 1 reactions 4 and 5 in the nh3 cl2 process six minutes of monochloramine contact time was provided to mask the majority of bromide as nhbrcl and nhbr2 these compounds were also found to be more resistant to ozonation than nh2br hampton roads sanitation district s hrsd swift research center src is a 3 8 mld demonstration scale advanced water treatment facility located in suffolk virginia the facility treats secondary effluent from the nansemond treatment plant 5 stage bardenpho process with methanol addition to drinking water standards for recharge into the potomac aquifer the treatment train consists of coagulation flocculation and sedimentation followed by ozonation biofiltration granular activated carbon adsorption and uv disinfection the facility also houses a similarly configured pilot scale 4 l min treatment plant for experimental work due to the low lying coastal nature of hrsd s collection system bromide concentrations of 400 µg l or higher are often present due to saltwater infiltration as well as specific industrial sources such as landfill leachate during initial testing ph suppression was found to be impractical on the pilot scale and cost prohibitive for full scale implementation due to the high alkalinity in the wastewater effluent data not shown hydrogen peroxide was not considered due to the project requirement to achieve an ozone residual for disinfection ct credit ammonia addition was tested briefly but could not effectively keep bromate below the mcl buehlmann et al 2017 preformed monochloramine where monochloramine is formed using sodium hypochlorite and ammonium sulfate fed into softened carrier water was selected for bromate control this was chosen due to the ease of control and decreased chemical demand over the nh3 cl2 or cl2 nh3 with somewhat variable nh4 and no2 in the wastewater effluent and the desire to minimize production of free chlorine dbps when nh4 is low preformed monochloramine also decreases the possibility of n nitrosodimethylamine ndma formation by dichloramine hogard et al 2021 mitch et al 2005 schreiber and mitch 2005 of particular concern is 1 4 dioxane a trace contaminant and potential human carcinogen commonly found in wastewater effluents due to its use in industry and household supplies such as detergents tanabe and kawata 2008 influent concentrations typically range from 0 5 to 1 µg l at the swift research center and it has a 10 6 lifetime cancer risk associated with a concentration of 0 35 µg l epa 2013 it is not readily biodegradable or well adsorbed and through ozonation it is only removed by oh oxidation in which case radical scavenging by nh2cl may decrease its removal hogard et al 2021 the objectives of this study were to determine the efficacy of preformed monochloramine for bromate control during ozonation of a high bromide reuse water secondary effects of monochloramine addition on oh exposure ozone demand decay and disinfection credit were also analyzed as well as ndma formation through ozonation while determining the mechanisms of bromate suppression by monochloramine was not the objective of this study results and the implications on treatment performance were analyzed in light of these mechanisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant description pilot tests were conducted at hrsd s src at the nansemond treatment plant suffolk va nansemond treatment plant is a 114 mld 30 mgd fully nitrifying and denitrifying plant utilizing a 5 stage bardenho treatment process with methanol addition for denitrification 3 8 mld 1 mgd of the secondary clarifier effluent is fed into the src the treatment train includes coagulation flocculation and sedimentation followed by ozonation biofiltration granular activated carbon adsorption and uv disinfection prior to deep well aquifer recharge the plant operation has been described extensively elsewhere hogard et al 2021 settled water from the src was fed to a pilot feed tank with a chiller to control the temperature to 20 0 8 c however for each test temperature stayed within a 1 c range influent water quality is summarized in table 2 a pipeline chloramine contactor was used upstream of the ozonation pilot to test the effects of monochloramine contact time as shown in figure 2 the ozone pilot used was a modified intuitech 2nd generation ozone pilot intuitech inc salt lake city usa operated at 3 94 l min the pilot ozone contactor consisted of one counter current dissolution column with a retention time of 1 5 min followed by five contact columns also with a retention time of 1 5 min each each of the contact columns had a series of sample ports to measure ozone residuals along the contactor ozone was generated from oxygen from the onboard oxygen concentrator ozone gas concentrations ranged from 3 4 to 9 8 w w as the lowest ozone doses required the gas flow rates to be increased for the oxygen ozone mass flow controllers to control the dose well measured ozone transfer efficiency was 99 however in the above configuration the gas flow rates 0 15 0 3 slpm were below the optimal gas flow rates for the off gas analyzer in previous testing with higher gas flow rates and lower gas concentrations transfer efficiency was still typically 95 applied ozone doses were selected by taking a grab sample for toc and nitrite and adjusting the dose for the desired o3 toc ratio all o3 toc ratios referenced herein are nitrite corrected a toc sample was also collected and sent to hrsd s central environmental laboratory at the beginning of each test the grab samples on the online instrument shimadzu toc 4200 were found to read slightly higher than the laboratory instrument so the lab values were used influent uv absorbance changed by less than 5 over the course of each testing day so toc was assumed to be constant for each test fig 2 preformed monochloramine stock was collected from the preformed monochloramine system at the src in this system tap water is fed through gac to dechlorinate and remove toc which then followed by softening via ion exchange sodium hypochlorite followed by ammonium sulfate are then added to the carrier water using static mixers the carrier water flow rate is set to target a 50x dilution to prevent heat buildup and chemicals are dosed for a 4 5 1 cl2 n ratio for optimal monochloramine formation monochloramine stock was collected daily during testing and fed using a peristaltic pump which was calibrated each time the chloramine addition point was changed monochloramine stock was kept on ice to prevent decay and used within four hours of collection the stock concentration was measured each time it was collected and at the end of each testing day never decaying more than 5 2 2 analytical methods monochloramine total chlorine and free ammonia were measured using a hach sl1000 portable parallel analyzer hach loveland co total ammonia nitrite and nitrate were measured by tnt methods 830 839 and 835 respectively and quantified on a hach dr 3900 spectrophotometer ozone residuals were measured by the gravimetric indigo method standard methods 4500b o3 with malonic acid addition to mask and free chlorine from chloramination or any oxidized bromide species which may be present indigo absorbance at 600 nm as well as uv254 absorbance of the water samples were measured on a genesys 180 uv vis spectrophotometer thermo scientific waltham ma bromide and bromate were analyzed by ion chromatography via epa methods 300 and 300 1 respectively bromate samples were preserved with eda in order to calculate total organic bromine tobr ozone effluent bromide samples were also collected the effluent bromide concentration was corrected for the bromide converted to bromate and compared to the influent after the method of buffle et al 2004 ozone effluent bromide samples were quenched with 2 mm sodium bisulfite within one minute of sample collection ndma and 1 4 dioxane were measured on an agilent 7010b gc ms triple quadrupole by epa methods 521 and 522 with some slight modification notably both samples were collected it the same 500 ml sample container preserved with 50 mg l sodium sulfite and 1 g l sodium bisulfate to dechlorinate and acidify the sample magnesium sulfate was used in place of sodium sulfate to dry the extract other slight deviations were as reported by vaidya et al 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 bromate formation without monochloramine addition bromate formation increased from 0 3 to 39 9 µg l by increasing the ozone dose from 0 31 to 1 18 o3 toc 3 75 to 9 6 mg l applied o3 as shown in fig 3 bromide conversion to bromate of 2 9 at 0 86 o3 toc is in line with the bench testing results reported by soltermann et al 2016 with monochloramine addition immediately before ozonation bromate formation was decreased by as much as 90 with 5 mg l cl2 nh2cl a dose of 1 mg l nh2cl reduced bromate formation by 68 on average while 3 and 5 mg l decreased it by 84 and 87 respectively increasing monochloramine contact time to 8 min had no effect on bromate control and is discussed further below at the lowest ozone doses targeting 0 3 o3 toc there was no dose response observed all bromate values were 1 µg l between monochloramine and bromate formed in these tests there was very little measured ozone residual in the effluent of the dissolution column other studies have shown very little bro3 formation at ozone doses below 0 4 o3 toc as there is very little ozone available to oxidize br and hobr obr to form bromate soltermann et al 2016 as shown in figs 3and 4 there was minimal improvement in bromate by increasing monochloramine dose from 3 to 5 mg l similar to both ammonia addition and the chlorine ammonia based strategies preformed monochloramine addition likely has a point of diminishing return where increasing dose has limited or no effect on controlling the bromate formation process buffle et al 2004 pinkernell and von gunten 2001 the location of this point is most likely water quality dependent benotti et al 2011 saw no additional bromate suppression from increasing nh2cl from 1 mg l to 2 mg l while ikehata et al 2013 observed a significant improvement interestingly ikehata et al had 35 lower bromide but higher ph and toc which may have increased their oh generation and bromate formation for similar ozone doses while some water quality parameters fluctuated over the course of testing mainly no2 it is assumed that the nature and reactivity of dom did not change 3 2 monochloramine as a oh scavenger 1 4 dioxane removal decreased from 49 to 33 by increasing monochloramine dose from 0 to 5 mg l at a fixed ozone dose of 7 mg l fig 4 this demonstrates that monochloramine is acting as a hydroxyl radical scavenger as 1 4 dioxane is ozone resistant and only removed by oh ko3 1 m 1s 1 k oh 3 109 m 1s 1 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 this is particularly important for wastewater ozonation where more bromate is formed through the indirect oh pathways soltermann et al 2017 1 4 dioxane samples were also collected with the control and 5 mg l nh2cl in the test matrix shown in fig 3 and 1 4 dioxane removal decreased by roughly half fig s1 a similar result was observed during ozonation at the 3 8 mld scale by hogard et al 2021 change in uv absorbance at 254 nm has been shown to be a good surrogate measure for oh exposure and 1 4 dioxane removal gerrity et al 2012 wert et al 2009 uv absorbance measurements were taken for all tests and were well correlated with 1 4 dioxane removal these results show that oh scavenging is occurring by monochloramine in all cases figs s2 s4 decreasing hydroxyl radical exposure by as much as 40 percent reduces bromate formation but it may also significantly reduce the oxidation capacity of the system if non biodegradable ozone recalcitrant compounds such as 1 4 dioxane atrazine or meprobamate are an issue or mib and geosmin in drinking water use of monochloramine for bromate suppression may be problematic high ozone doses are often required to get sufficient removal of these compounds in which case monochloramine use for bromate control is counterproductive some compounds with moderate reactivity with ozone such as gemfibrozil and atenolol are removed by both ozone and hydroxyl radicals lee et al 2013 with monochloramine addition ozone dose may need to be increased in order to account for the lower oh exposure to remove these compounds additionally increasing chloramine doses also increase the chemical dose required to quench monochloramine before biofiltration and the addition of nitrogen with preformed monochloramine may require increased nitrogen removal in the wastewater treatment plant to meet total nitrogen or nitrate limits on the other hand many trace organic contaminants are oxidized quickly by molecular ozone at low ozone doses compounds such as diclofenac or sulfamethoxazole with ko3 104 m 1s 1 are primarily removed by ozone despite their high reactivity with oh 3 3 monochloramine contact time increasing monochloramine contact time upstream of ozonation was tested to determine if bromochloramine formation table 1 reaction 4 prior to ozonation further decreases bromate formation two conditions were tested including 1 monochloramine addition directly before the pilot feed pump approximately 10 s before entering the ozone contactor and 2 monochloramine addition eight minutes upstream using a small pipeline contactor for the tests shown in figs 3and 4 eight minutes of chloramine contact prior to ozonation did not result in decreased bromate formation contact times up to 30 min were also tested fig 5 and no decrease in bromate formation was observed ling et al 2020 showed 92 masking of bromide as nhbrcl nhbr2 and nh2br with six minutes of nh3 cl2 pretreatment and even greater with 10 min this was said to be occurring through reactions with nh2cl suggesting preformed monochloramine should behave similarly ideally masking of bromide prior to ozonation would improve bromate suppression allowing the chemical doses to be decreased this would in turn decrease radical scavenging by nh2cl and improve 1 4 dioxane removal however that was not the case for this study luh and mariñas 2014 claimed that the trofe et al 1980 mechanism table 1 reaction 4 was inaccurate and showed that it would take several hours for bromochloramine to form at nh2cl and br concentrations relevant to water treatment ling et al 2020 and luh and mariñas 2014 both use spectrophotometric methods in pure waters however they assume different absorbance peaks for nhbrcl measurement unfortunately in real water samples with the background absorbance of the water matrix these methods are not applicable the dpd total chlorine and indophenol monochloramine methods used in this study cannot distinguish between the various haloamine species in either case there does not appear to be any practical benefit of increasing monochloramine contact time for bromate control in many of the tests figs 3and 4 it appeared that the slight decay in nh2cl over the contact time resulted in decreased bromate suppression at the swift research center preformed monochloramine is added to the ozone sidestream immediately before the venturi injector this effectively doubles the monochloramine dose in the sidestream with a 50 50 sidestream flow split and decreases bromate formation by several µg l data not shown this arrangement would not be feasible with increased monochloramine contact time to the entire flow 3 4 intermediate masking fig 4 shows a significant decrease in bromate formation with the addition of 1 mg l nh2cl followed by a more gradual decrease with increasing dose thereafter 1 4 dioxane removal shows a gradual decrease throughout oh radical exposure calculated using 1 4 dioxane as a probe compound with k oh 3 109 m 1s 1 was decreased by 22 at 1 mg l nh2cl and 41 at 5 mg l nh2cl while bromate was reduced by 56 and 87 percent respectively this suggests that oh radical scavenging is not the only method of bromate suppression by monochloramine while it does not appear that nhbrcl is forming prior to ozonation it can be formed from hobr and nh2cl during ozonation table 1 reaction 2 additionally some free ammonia was always fed with the monochloramine stock solution to ensure only monochloramine was formed therefore nh2br can also be formed during ozonation via reaction 1 table 1 as hobr only reacts with the nonionic form nh3 the effective rate constant between hobr and total ammonia nh3 nh4 at ph 7 is similar to that of bromochloramine formation so both compounds are likely to form as intermediates 3 5 ozone demand decay and disinfection credit fig 6 shows ozone decay with increasing monochloramine dose with a 7 mg l applied ozone dose the first ozone residual measurement was excluded from the decay rate calculations as it does not fit the linearized 1st order ozone decay curves this first point was taken at the outlet of the dissolution column approximately 2 5 s after the ozone diffuser where the initial instantaneous demand phase of ozone decay would not yet be complete increasing monochloramine dose had no effect on ozone decay rate this shows that ozone decay and oh generation is controlled by direct reactions with dom rather than by radical chain reaction and not affected by the addition of a radical scavenger in another study and previous testing with this pilot at a different hrsd treatment plant an increase in ozone decay rate was observed with monochloramine addition pearce et al 2018 benotti et al 2011 this was hypothesized to be due to monochloramine oxidation to nitrate by ozone via reaction 5 in table 1 some monochloramine decay was observed through ozonation data not shown benotti et al 2011 had to increase their ozone dose by approximately 15 percent to achieve the same cryptosporidium ct credit in river water when adding 1 mg l monochloramine however that does not appear to be the case in the present study this indicates that slower reacting compounds with rate constants on the order of 26 m 1s 1 do not control ozone decay rate overall ozone decay rate decreased with increasing ozone dose and was unaffected by monochloramine addition as shown in fig 7 a initial or instantaneous ozone demand iod is operationally defined as the difference between the transferred ozone dose and the measured residual at the outlet of the dissolution column iod increased linearly with increasing dose but decreased as a fraction of the transferred dose fig 7b even at the highest ozone dose iod was still greater than 50 of the transferred ozone dose iod was also unaffected by monochloramine addition as direct reactions with dom control ozone decay during this phase and play a larger role in wastewater ozonation buffle et al 2006 table 3 shows the calculated virus and cryptosporidium log inactivation credits for viruses ct was calculated using the maximum of the single point ct from the measured ozone residual samples multiplied by the retention time from the outlet of the dissolution column to the respective sample port in wastewater with high ozone decay rates the measured single point ct can vary significantly for the same ozone residual profile depending on where the residual is measured even when optimized the single point ct method is extremely conservative and significantly underestimates the true ozone exposure in the system despite this all but the lowest doses tested were sufficient for significant viral inactivation credit as shown in table 3 one log virus credit was given for dissolution column effluent ozone residuals 0 1 mg l for cryptosporidium ct was calculated by integrating the first order ozone residual decay curves this is approximately equivalent to the extended cstr or extended t10 methods typically used to achieve cryptosporidium ct credit rakness et al 2005 a baffle factor of 0 9 was applied in all cases to approximate the pipeline contactor at the src the calculated log inactivation credit from the chemical dose matrix decreases with increasing monochloramine dose however this is likely due to the ozone doses being increased during the control test for nitrite demand which decreased throughout the testing day while monochloramine doses were increased with a fixed ozone dose of 7 mg l 1 07 o3 toc increasing monochloramine dose had no effect on the calculated cryptosporidium lrv hrsd currently operates the ozone system at the swift research center to achieve 3 log virus inactivation credit using a single point ct calculation in a pipeline contactor from these pilot tests this target would be achieved around 0 6 to 0 8 o3 toc which is consistent with full scale operation hogard et al 2021 two log cryptosporidium inactivation credit would require an ozone dose of approximately 1 1 o3 toc when using an integrated ct method a dose of 3 mg l cl2 preformed monochloramine was able to keep bromate below the mcl at ozone doses as high as this in terms of contaminant oxidation ozone doses this high are mostly beneficial for the removal of more ozone recalcitrant compounds whose removal may be negatively affected by hydroxyl radical scavenging by monochloramine unless ozone ct is necessary for a secondary barrier to cryptosporidium it may be easier to achieve this removal elsewhere as many o3 baf based reuse treatment trains utilize membrane filtration or downstream uv disinfection gerrity et al 2013 3 6 ndma and brominated organics fig 8 shows the ozone effluent ndma with and without monochloramine addition these samples were taken during the control and 5 mg l nh2cl conditions shown in figs 3 and s1 ndma formation increased with increasing ozone dose until it plateaued around 0 6 o3 toc which is consistent with previous results on this water and other literature results hogard et al 2021 snyder et al 2015 monochloramine addition did not increase ndma formation while both monochloramine and ozone can form ndma they are formed by distinctly different groups of precursors sgroi et al 2018 many nh2cl ndma precursors are well removed by ozonation lee et al 2007 ndma formation potential tests conducted on this water by vaidya et al 2021 showed an average of 780 ng l ndma formed with 140 mg l cl2 nh2cl after 10 days of contact an ozone dose of 0 6 o3 toc decreased formation potential by approximately 90 in previous testing by hogard et al 2021 increased ozone effluent ndma was observed at 2 mg l o3 with 3 mg l preformed monochloramine this indicated that 2 mg l ozone was insufficient to remove the nh2cl ndma precursors and that monochloramine could form ndma in the eight minute contact time of the ozone contactor however that did not appear to be the case here a dose of 5 mg l cl2 preformed monochloramine was added to the settled water and ndma was sampled over 90 min table s1 no ndma formation was observed which is not unexpected as ndma formation by monochloramine is typically quite slow on the order of days in drinking water distribution systems preforming monochloramine should also minimize the risk of ndma formation by dichloramine schreiber mitch 2006 even at the lowest ozone doses ndma was greater than most drinking water regulatory limits of 10 ng l indicating that removal by downstream biofiltration or uv photolysis would be required the formation of brominated organic disinfection byproducts is also a concern with chlorination and chloramination of bromide containing waters though most of these compounds are unregulated they are thought to be more toxic than their chlorinated counterparts sharma et al 2014 buffle et al 2004 showed significant total organic bromine tobr formed during the cl2 nh3 process as much as 30 of the of the initial bromide ended up as tobr and this was reduced to approximately 15 with increased background ammonia causing nh2cl formation in this study effluent bromide was measured on select samples with ozonation and chloramination table s2 tobr estimated as missing bromide between the ozone influent and effluent and corrected for bromate was always less than 5 which is well within the range of analytical error and influent bromide fluctuation brominated organic formation does not appear to be a concern here similar to ndma formation it may take more time for these compounds to form ozonated samples were quenched with bisulfite within one minute of sample collection giving a maximum contact time of 8 min with monochloramine plus 10 min through the ozone contactor and sample collection bromide samples were also collected with ndma with up to 90 min of monochloramine contact time table s1 and again no brominated organic formation was observed at least within the sensitivity of the difference in the bromate corrected bromide concentrations 4 conclusions with a bromide concentration of 414 µg l bromate exceeded the mcl of 10 µg l at specific ozone doses greater than 0 7 o3 toc monochloramine doses of 3 or 5 mg l cl2 nh2cl were able to control bromate formation to below the mcl at ozone doses up to 1 2 1 o3 toc and suppress bromate formation by as much as 90 there was little improvement by increasing the monochloramine dose from 3 to 5 mg l cl2 monochloramine is acting as a hydroxyl radical scavenger as evidenced by diminished 1 4 dioxane removal with increasing monochloramine dose use of monochloramine is a tradeoff between radical scavenging for bromate control and decreased removal of ozone resistant compounds which are removed through oh oxidation alone removal of the most ozone reactive trace contaminants should be unaffected use of monochloramine for bromate control should come with serious evaluation of oxidation objectives increasing monochloramine contact time upstream of ozonation did not improve bromate control indicating that bromide is not being masked as haloamines prior to ozonation monochloramine should be added as soon before ozonation as possible as monochloramine decay over longer contact times appeared to decrease bromate suppression monochloramine addition did not have any effect on ozone demand decay rate or calculated disinfection credit which is counter to previous drinking water results this shows that ozone decay is unaffected by a radical terminator and that slow reactions between ozone and compounds such as monochloramine do not play much of a role in wastewater effluent though this may be water quality dependent ndma formation increased with increasing ozone dose until 0 6 o3 toc where it plateaued at 60 75 ng l ndma formation through ozonation was not affected by monochloramine addition for bromate control it is likely that the short contact time before ozonation is insufficient for ndma formation by monochloramine however the precursors may not have been present during these tests as precursor concentrations can be dependent on the source water and upstream treatment plant operation brominated organic formation does not appear to be a concern through ozonation either with or without monochloramine addition as there was a near perfect mass balance on bromide when accounting for bromide converted to bromate declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

16306,exoelectrogenic biofilm and the associated microbial electrochemical processes have recently been intensively studied for water treatment but their response to and interaction with polyethylene pe microplastics which are widespread in various aquatic environments has never been reported here we investigated how and to what extent pe microplastics would affect the electrochemistry and microbiology of exoelectrogenic biofilm in both microbial fuel cells mfcs and microbial electrolysis cells mecs when the pe microplastics concentration was increased from 0 to 75 mg l in the mecs an apparent decline in the maximum current density from 1 99 to 0 74 a m2 and abundance of electroactive bacteria eab in the exoelectrogenic biofilm was noticed while in the mfcs the current output was not significantly influenced and the abundance of eab lightly increased at 25 mg l microplastics in addition pe microplastics restrained the viability of the exoelectrogenic biofilms in both systems leading to a higher system electrode resistance moreover the microbial community richness and the microplastics related operational taxonomic units decreased with pe microplastics furthermore the electron transfer related genes e g pila and mtrc and cytochrome c concentration decreased after adding microplastics this study provides the first glimpse into the influence of pe microplastics on the exoelectrogenic biofilm with the potential mechanisms revealed at the gene level laying a methodological foundation for the future development of efficient water treatment technologies graphical

concentration of microplastics would accumulate to a considerable concentration because of the hard degradable properties mps are considered an emerging threat because they are important vectors of different pollutants including antibiotics heavy metals and micropollutants avio et al 2017 niu et al 2021 sarkar et al 2021 it has been estimated that the mps in the body of organisms could induce a physical toxicity disturbance and digestive system entanglements resulting in the damage of aquatic ecosystems niu et al 2021 seidensticker et al 2017 nano polystyrene plastics could easily enter the body of organisms such as invertebrates cole and galloway 2015 trevisan et al 2019 and plants sun et al 2020 triggering severe adverse responses besides evidence also showed that mps could influence microbial activities and metabolisms by reshaping their community structure for example polyethylene terephthalate mps could inhibit the hydrolysis process in aerobic digestion wei et al 2021 the methanogenesis process could be significantly restrained by long term exposure to polyvinyl chloride mps because of the alteration of microbial composition zhang et al 2020a it was also reported that the microbial nitrogen cycle in the sediment could be interfered with by different kinds of mps seeley et al 2020 the capacity of wastewater treatment could be influenced in the presence of mps qin et

circuit model according to previous methods wang et al 2020a 2 3 3 the extraction and analysis of eps a heating method was used to extract different eps fractions from the anode biofilm at the end of the experiment li et al 2021 the carbon brush with biofilm was rinsed in 0 9 nacl and then heated at 70 c for 30 min followed by centrifuging at 10 750 g for 15 min the suspension was collected and filtered through a 0 22 µm filter as loosely bound eps lb eps the carbon brush left in the centrifuge tube was then resuspended in 0 9 nacl and 5 na2 edta then shaken at 180 rpm for 4 h the collected suspension was filtered and obtained as tightly bound eps tb eps the eps obtained above were characterized with excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy eems were measured using an aqualog fluorometer horiba to show the changes of lb eps and tb eps absorbance and fluorescence excitation was measured from 240 to 600 nm in 3 nm increments fluorescence emission was recorded with a

procedures coble 2007 2 3 4 biofilm viability observations live dead cells were visualized to evaluate the viability of biofilm on the surface of the anodic carbon brush under different pe mp concentrations the carbon brush samples were collected in triplicate for each reactor at the end of the experiment the viability of the biofilm on the carbon brush was observed using the confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm leica tcs sp5 germany before the observations the biofilm samples were rinsed with 50 mm pbs then stained with a live dead baclight bacterial viability kit invitrogen carlsbad ca united states and incubated in the dark for 15 min and afterward rinsed with 50 mm pbs twice to remove the residual fluorochrome the biofilm was measured under the z stack mode the green and red dyes of syto 9 and propidium iodide were used to stain the live and dead cells which could emit green and dead fluorescence respectively the excitation and emission for syto 9 are 488 nm and

in triplicate through a real time quantitative pcr detecting system abi 7500 applied biosystems usa including pila and mtrc he et al 2021 zakaria and dhar 2020 the primers of these genes were listed in table s1 electron transfer relevant enzymes including cytochrome c extracellular and nadh intracellular were extracted and measured based on volatile suspended solids vss following the previous procedure zhang et al 2021a 2 6 statistical analysis all data were represented as mean sem standard error of the mean partial least squares discriminant analysis pls da was performed between mfcs and mecs using the r package mixomics version 3 3 1 circos was visualized through circos software http circos ca the co network analysis was drawn using gephi based on the spearman correlations data output from the r psych package the p value 0 05 was regarded as statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrochemical response of exoelectrogenic biofilm to pe mp the performance of electrogenesis biofilm under different pe mp concentrations was investigated in terms of current density output and cod removal efficiency in mfcs and mecs fig 1 a shows that different pe mp concentrations did not significantly influence the current density output from mfcs however in the mecs mode the maximum current density decreased with the increase of pe mp concentration 1 99 1 37 and 0 74 a m2 at 0 25 and 75 mg l respectively fig 1b in the mfcs the current was generated from the acetate oxidation by the mature biofilm zhang et al 2011 in this case the pe mp might influence only a part of mature biofilm which was not sufficient to affect the current response while in the mecs the current was influenced by the internal resistance at a given applied voltage cario et al 2019 thus the decreased current would result from the increased internal resistance in the presence of pe mp this result was consistent with the previous study which reported the decreased volumetric current density with the exposure of silver nanoparticles in mecs zakaria and dhar 2020 at the end of the batch run the cod removal efficiency of mfcs with pe mp was 57 65 8 04 mfc75 and 61 93 10 25 mfc25 which was lower than that without pe mp exposure 63 22 0 77 mfc0 fig s1a similar trends were observed in mecs fig s1b the cod removal efficiency corresponded with the activity of electrogenesis biofilm which pe mp is likely to influence fig s2a and s2b showed no significant oxidation reduction peaks during forward and reverse scans however the reactor without pe mp showed higher current generation than that with pe mp exposure in both mfcs and mecs eis was performed to measure the impedance of mess through the nyquist plot of the anode electrode the electrode potential loss mainly include ohmic loss activated loss and mass transfer loss which represent the rs rct and rd respectively the nyquist plots are shown in fig 1c the total resistance calculated from the equivalent circuit model increased from 8 33 ω in mfc0 to 301 33 ω in mfc25 and from 35 47 ω in mec0 to 91 46 ω in mec75 fig 1d it is clear that the resistance of rct contributed most of the total resistance and the resistance increased under the influence of pe mp this demonstrated the mass transfer was down with a lower electron transfer capability ren et al 2019 the toxic of pe mp might also inhibit some bacteria and increase the mass transfer resistance previous research showed that the metal anode deposited nanoparticles can decrease the charge transfer resistances by improving the conductivity of the electrode wang et al 2019 however in this study the presence of non conductive pe mp increased the rct from 6 42 ω mfc0 to 79 97 ω mfc75 and from 28 48 ω to 83 81 ω in mec0 and mec75 besides the toxic of the pe mp might increase the population of dead cells resulting in increasing of the electron transfer distance and the charge transfer resistance wang et al 2020a the results might be ascribed to the influence of pe mp on the activity and viability of the electrogenic biofilm and the weakened eet process in the future studies catalyst free cathode could be employed to reduce the capital costs for the treatment alvarez gallego et al 2012 pasupuleti et al 2016 overall the multiplexed conductive pathway could be weakened by pe mp in mess 3 2 effect of pe mp on biofilm viability the viability of the anodic biofilm under different pe mp levels was investigated through clsm imaging fig 2 a c and fig 2d f represent the clsm z stack images for mfcs and mecs respectively results showed that a low concentration of mp 25 mg l promoted the biofilm viability in mfcs but when the mps concentration increased to 75 mg l the biofilm viability decreased significantly to further assess the distribution of dead and live cells the fluorescence intensity and ratio between live and dead cells based on fluorescence intensity were calculated fig 2g and h in mfcs the live and dead cells fluorescence intensity all increased at a 25 mg l pe mp and then decreased in higher concentration of pe mp however there was a clear decline of the ratio between live and dead cell with pe mp concentration increased from 0 to 75 mg l fig 2h with the ratio of dead cells increased from 31 66 1 24 to 49 72 0 34 low concentration of pe mp promoted the growth of biofilm bacteria which was consistent with previous report that the mps derived nutrients contributed to bacterial growth chen et al 2021 the reduction of live cells fluorescence intensity and ratio of live cells was observed when the concentration of pe mp increased in mecs the occurrence of pe mp could hinder the growth of biofilm in mecs and result in a higher ratio of dead cells increasing from 37 50 0 65 to 49 15 3 22 with pe mp concentration increased from 0 to 75 mg l high mps will be more harmful to microbiology activities result in cell dysfunction and inhibit the growth of some functional bacteria previous studies have unraveled that polyethylene terephthalate mps and polyvinyl chloride mps posed toxicity to the viability of the cell via toxic leachate from microplastics which would result in cell death wei et al 2021 zhang et al 2020a it has also been reported that the mps in marine could cause negative effects on the organism sun et al 2018 same with our study the growth of exoelectrogenic microbes and their attachment to the electrode was inhibited at higher mps concentration because of the toxicities agree with the overlay clsm fig s3 the presence of more dead cells might affect the eet process since the electron product from the live cells had to transfer over the dead cells to the electrode sun et al 2015 the death cells layer could increase the electrode resistance which was also shown from the eis result that the relative higher dead cells resulting in a relative high resistant liang et al 2011 the mfc75 showed relatively lower dead cells and thus the internal resistance was relatively lower than that of mfc25 3 3 eps distribution in the exoelectrogenic biofilm the abundance of eps could reveal the performance of anodic biofilm li et al 2021 thus fluorescence spectroscopy was used to fingerprint lb eps and tb eps in the processed eps samples fig s4 and 3 optical fingerprints distinguished between the different eps fractions and experimental treatments fig s5 it has been well documented that the difference among various types of eps resulted from the functional particular components distribution li et al 2021 the lightly bound eps can easily be loose under the influence of the pe mp and the tb eps was more stably attached to the exoelectrogenic bacteria he et al 2019 this is the reason why they clustered differently as shown in fig 3a f two main peaks peak t and peak c were observed at ex em of 275 330 nm and 337 447 nm which was assumed to be a proxy for protein like and humic like fractions li et al 2016 wei et al 2016 the normalized fi of each peak was summarized to examine qualitative variation of the substrates the fi of peak t for tb eps was reduced with different doses of mps in mfcs a similar result was observed for mecs except for a slight increase when it varied from mec25 0 77 0 29 to mec75 1 09 0 34 fig 3a f and s4g previous observation of protein production in eps showed that protein could be promoted under microbial electrochemical cultivation process or the suitable anode potential and was likely being involved in the eet process hou et al 2020 li et al 2021 the distinct suppression in the eps protein has also been previously demonstrated in anaerobic methane recovery experiment with polyvinyl chloride mps exposure zhang et al 2020a here pe mp might inhibit the protein production in the electroactive bacteria and thereby weakening the eet process in mess also the decreasing of the eps under the influence of pe mp could expose the bacteria to the outside toxic chemicals resulting in cells death and thereby weakening the performance of the electroactive bacteria similarly more markedly reduced peak t could be observed for lb eps fig s4a f as the lightly bound eps the lb eps was more easily influenced with the exposure of pe mp humic substances have been well known as the electron mediators involved in the indirect eet pathway and it can also shift the community structure xiao and zhao 2017 it seems no compositional changes in the area of peak c humic like substrates according to the fluorescence in mfcs fig 3a c and s4h thus the pe mp seems did not play a critical role in changing the content of humic like substrates in mfcs comparatively pe mp affected the humic like substrate in mecs fig 3d f s4h the peak c with the higheer lb eps in mecs fig s4d f thus mps might first affect the protein and humic like substrates composition in eps which was demonstrated as an important substance for the electrochemical activity of the biofilm in mess xiao and zhao 2017 furthermore the exposed bacteria might be inhibited by the toxic compounds from the pe mp which would also be the reason for the increased dead cells ratio when pe mp existed detailed mechanism analysis are required in future studies to reveal the synergistic interactions among mps eps and electroactive biofilm 3 4 the effect of mps on the microbial community of exoelectrognic biofim a total of 420 otus were identified from all the samples with a 97 sequence similarity rarefaction curves showed that the microbial richness exposure to pe mp decreased compared to the control fig 4 a similarly decrease in richness was found through chao 1 and ace estimator table 1 the richness of bacterial communities on pe mp has also been reported lower than that in natural substrates miao et al 2019 the presence of microplastics would be toxic to the cell growth which could also be reflected by the decreased cell viability and eps microbial diversity shannon estimator increased in mfcs with pe mp from 2 198 mfc0 to 2 759 mfc25 and 2 550 mfc75 but declined in mecs table 1 indicating that some microbial communities are sensitive to the pe mp toxic effects zhang and chen 2020b in addition pls da was conducted to evaluate the microbial community structure alterations and reveal whether there are differences among different group samples a clear difference between mfcs and mecs were existed indicating the varied community structures under different modes fig 4b remarkable cluster for mec25 and mec75 showing the species selectivity from pe mp in mecs previous research has also demonstrated the obvious different microbial communities between plastic and non plastic substrates miao et al 2019 the identified otus were assigned to 21 phyla 293 genus and 361 species the composition of phylum among these six samples was presented in fig 4c using circos the five most abundant phyla were proteobacteria bacteroidota actinobacteriota firmicutes and desulfobacterota as the most abundant phyla proteobacteria showed an increasing trend in mfcs with the pe mp concentrations increase specifically it increased from 63 21 in mec0 to 78 50 mec25 and 85 42 mec75 the relative abundance of firmicutes also increased with the pe mp in both mfcs 5 13 to 6 26 and mecs 5 21 to 7 13 however significant decrease could be found in mecs for phyla actinobacteriota decreasing from 13 82 in mec0 to 11 87 in mec25 and 1 76 in mec75 the 50 most abundant genera from the microbial communities of six samples were shown as heatmap in fig s6 the several high abundant genera are widely found in mess such as acinetobacter bacteroidales no rank at genus level dechlorosoma and desulfovibrio wang et al 2020a zakaria and dhar 2020 zhang et al 2021b functional genera of eab were selected and visualized using a heatmap fig 4d as one of the most famous eab geobacter could oxidize acetate and release electricity in mess kimura and okabe 2013 in the mecs the abundance of geobacter decreased from 6 49 mec0 to 0 71 mec25 and 0 05 mec75 with increasing of the pe mp concentration however in mfcs the abundance increased slightly in mfc25 and then it decreased to the same level as mfc0 and mfc75 mycobacterium was also weakened in mec25 1 38 and mec75 0 12 compared with that without pe mp 8 03 in mec0 it has been reported that mycobacterium has the ability of eet jin et al 2018 a decreased trend could also be found in mecs for genus comamonas that is capable of electron transfer yang et al 2019 with the increasing of pe mp concentration romboutsia which was reported as potential electricigens in soil mfcs li et al 2018 decreased not only in mecs 0 96 to 0 32 but also in mfcs 0 62 to 0 08 besides the bioelectricity generation related genus clostridium sensu stricto 13 and dysgonomonas in mfcs shrank with pe mp li et al 2018 tian et al 2017 when comparison of the abundance in all mfcs it was observed that some genera in mfc25 had a higher abundance than mfc0 and also mfc75 which include geobacter desulfovibrio clostridium sensu stricto 1 parabacteroides bacillus and pseudomonas the results indicated that the low level pe mp might motivate the growth of some electrogenic bacteria this phenomenon could also be reflected in the cv curve and the clsm analysis fig s2a and 2b among all the functional genus bacillus was the only one who was reported that could generate electricity and degrade polyethylene plastics auta et al 2017 islam et al 2017 so the low concentration of pe mp might serve as the substrate and increase the growth of bacillus while the high concentration might have toxicity to the cells the above results demonstrated that the presence of pe mp could alter the anodic microbial communities esspecially the ones are known for eet it is still not clear about the distribution pattern of eab and the interaction between pe mps concentrations and all the biofilm community thus co occurrence network analysis were constructed among pe mp concentrations marked as mps the summary abundance of the exoelectrogenic bacteria marked as eab here and the abundance of all otus from different modes of samples the eab was summarized as one consortium to easily evaluate the relationship between eab as a total community and the individual otus in mfcs the interaction of total eab abundance pe mp concentrations and 314 otus was visualized in fig 5 a showing significant spearman correlations p 0 05 among all the otus nodes 86 nodes with 85 pairs of edges were identified significantly response to the abundance of eab and pe mp concentrations notably 38 outs showed negative correlations with pe mp concentrations 38 red edges higher than that between eab and otus 14 red edges the positive relationships were less than those two indicating that the pe mp concentrations and eab consortium have a more negative influence on the correlated otus in mfcs there are 109 otus nodes and 213 significant correlations between eab mps and otus in the network of mecs fig 5b most of the correlations related to pe mp were negative 82 red edges while most of the eab related relationships were positive 81 blue edges these observations suggested that pe mp concentrations had a remarkable negative effect on the microbial taxon in mfcs and mecs this showed that the toxic effect of pe mp on the eam growth it has been previously reported that the polyvinyl chloride mps could negatively influence the content of some key acidogens and methanogens in anaerobic digestion systems zhang et al 2020a this was consistent with the observation of the low clsm intensity in mfc75 and mec75 fig 2c and 2f and low richness reflected by rarefaction curves fig 4a 3 5 quantification of functional genes and eet mechanisms in mess the current generation is determined by the eet capability of the anodic microbial communities wang and ren 2013 the effect of mps on the exoelectrogenic biofilm could be reflected through the transform of the eet pathway thus the expression level of two essential genes related to eet process was evaluated including pila and mtrc he et al 2021 zakaria and dhar 2020 quantitative pcr results revealed that the abundance of these two functional genes appeared higher in the samples without pe mp mfc0 and mec0 mec75 harbored the lowest abundance of the plia gene while it was similar between mec0 and mec25 there was a decline trend of the mtrc gene with the pe mp concentrations increased from 0 to 75 mg l in mfcs from 1 87 0 01 to 1 75 0 01 log copies ng dna and mecs from 1 99 0 03 to 1 68 0 03 log copies ng dna when the exoelectrogenic biofilm was exposed to the pe mp the expression of the eet related genes was inhibited which down the electron transfer enzymes the reduced gene with mps exposure would result from the low percentage of eab according to fig 4d as the membrane bound redox protein cytochrome c plays a key role in eet process xiao and zhao 2017 in the mfcs the highest abundant cytochrome c was found in mfc25 5 18 1 03 mg g vss while mfc75 2 77 0 62 mg g vss has the lowest level the resulst imply that the low concentration of pe mp could accelerate the eet while the high content of pe mp would inhibit it the clsm and eab abundance analysis also confirmed the rich bacteria grow on the surface of the anode in mfc25 fig 2a and 2d in contrast cytochrome c content in mecs sharply dropped with the presence of pe mp similar as the circuit current shown in fig 1b the gene encoded cytochrome c could be the electron shuttle assisting the transfer of electrons meanwhile cytochrome c containing subunit ii was reported to decrease with polyethersulfone mps addition in the nitrifying process qin et al 2020 thus the drop of cytochrome c in exoelectrogenic biofilm may result from the low expression of electrogenic genes and the abundance of eab in the previous case c type cytochrome expression could be influenced under intermittent electro driving electrochemical biofilms wang et al 2020a it hinted at the different results in different mess as the intracellular electron carrier nadh was facilitated in the mfcs with the occurrence of pe mp while it was repressed in mecs fig 6 b although electrons could be transported through nadh dehydrogenase it is difficult to identify the influence of pe mp on nadh in mess rabaey and verstraete 2005 in this study we could elucidate that the electron carriers were upregulated with pe mp in mfcs but it turned to the opposite in mecs 4 conclusions in this study the influence of pe mp on the electrogenic bacteria in mfcs and mecs was demonstrated for the first time it was found that the current density showed no significant difference with the occurrence of pe mp in mfcs but decreased with the increase of pe mp concentration in mecs besides the presence of pe mp decreased the cod removal efficiency while it increased the resistance of anode biofilm in both systems a low concentration of pe mps could enhance exoelectrogens viability in mfcs but the high content of pe mp may suppress the viability in both mfcs and mecs in addition the ratio of the dead cell increased from 31 66 1 24 to 49 72 0 34 in the mfcs and from 37 50 0 65 to 49 15 3 22 in the mecs reflecting a toxic effect of mps on the exoelectrogens biofilm the presence of pe mps decreased the protein content in eps moreover the richness of the microbial communities in the biofilm decreased with the increase of pe mp level eab abundance increased after adding 25 mg l mps in mfcs but it dropped with pe mp in mecs furthermore most of the mp related otus were significantly negative with pe mp according to co network the effect of microplastics on eet related genes and membrane bound cytochrome c was evaluated for the first time in this study the reduction of the eet would decrease the efficiency of the microbial electrochemical processes this is the first study revealing the role of microplastics in the microbial electrochemical systems treating wastewater the results will address an intriguing question in science add to knowledge on environmental impact of microplastics provide new knowledge for researchers

16306,exoelectrogenic biofilm and the associated microbial electrochemical processes have recently been intensively studied for water treatment but their response to and interaction with polyethylene pe microplastics which are widespread in various aquatic environments has never been reported here we investigated how and to what extent pe microplastics would affect the electrochemistry and microbiology of exoelectrogenic biofilm in both microbial fuel cells mfcs and microbial electrolysis cells mecs when the pe microplastics concentration was increased from 0 to 75 mg l in the mecs an apparent decline in the maximum current density from 1 99 to 0 74 a m2 and abundance of electroactive bacteria eab in the exoelectrogenic biofilm was noticed while in the mfcs the current output was not significantly influenced and the abundance of eab lightly increased at 25 mg l microplastics in addition pe microplastics restrained the viability of the exoelectrogenic biofilms in both systems leading to a higher system electrode resistance moreover the microbial community richness and the microplastics related operational taxonomic units decreased with pe microplastics furthermore the electron transfer related genes e g pila and mtrc and cytochrome c concentration decreased after adding microplastics this study provides the first glimpse into the influence of pe microplastics on the exoelectrogenic biofilm with the potential mechanisms revealed at the gene level laying a methodological foundation for the future development of efficient water treatment technologies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics microbial exoelectrogenic biofilm microbial electrochemical systems extracellular electron transfer 1 introduction microplastics mps plastic particles less than 5 mm have been found worldwide prevalent in the terrestrial and aquatic environment wastewater rivers lakes and ocean and even in the secluded environment peeken et al 2018 rochman 2018 woodward et al 2021 the amount of mps in the environment is growing fast due to the degradation of plastics from industrial abrasives and personal care products especially during the covid 19 period when the face masks are extensively consumed kwak and an 2021 sun et al 2020 the vast majority of microplastics from domestic and industrial wastewater would flow into the wastewater treatment systems zhang et al 2020a the mps concentration found in the influent of danish municipal sewage treatment plants was as high as 29 6 mg l vollertsen and hansen 2017 in the influent of a wastewater treatment plant in south korea it could reach 31 400 particles l hidayaturrahman and lee 2019 furthermore high concentration of nano polystyrene and polyethylene microplasitics e g 320 mg l and 100 mg l respectively were used to reveal the influence on cell viability and wastewater biotreatment performance sun et al 2018 tang et al 2021 with the continued use of the plastic product the concentration of microplastics would accumulate to a considerable concentration because of the hard degradable properties mps are considered an emerging threat because they are important vectors of different pollutants including antibiotics heavy metals and micropollutants avio et al 2017 niu et al 2021 sarkar et al 2021 it has been estimated that the mps in the body of organisms could induce a physical toxicity disturbance and digestive system entanglements resulting in the damage of aquatic ecosystems niu et al 2021 seidensticker et al 2017 nano polystyrene plastics could easily enter the body of organisms such as invertebrates cole and galloway 2015 trevisan et al 2019 and plants sun et al 2020 triggering severe adverse responses besides evidence also showed that mps could influence microbial activities and metabolisms by reshaping their community structure for example polyethylene terephthalate mps could inhibit the hydrolysis process in aerobic digestion wei et al 2021 the methanogenesis process could be significantly restrained by long term exposure to polyvinyl chloride mps because of the alteration of microbial composition zhang et al 2020a it was also reported that the microbial nitrogen cycle in the sediment could be interfered with by different kinds of mps seeley et al 2020 the capacity of wastewater treatment could be influenced in the presence of mps qin et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b however the study of mps and their effect on natural or engineered processes is in its infancy a deeper understanding of the role of mps in several key microbial processes is still missing microbial electrochemical systems mess such as microbial fuel cells mfcs and microbial electrolysis cells mecs which employ electroactive bacteria eab to harvest electrons from organic or inorganic pollutants have been widely studied and considered a promising and energy efficient approach for wastewater treatment and clean production of high value chemicals chiranjeevi and patil 2020 wang and ren 2013 bajracharya et al 2016 fu et al 2021 the activity of eab and the formed biofilm is the crucial element that determines the extracellular electron transfer eet ability and the electrogenesis performance of various mess extracellular polymeric substances eps are fundamental components and complex chemical microenvironments in the structure of biofilm they could prevent the biofilm from being attacked by antibiotics and immune cells playing essential roles in the microbial eet process karygianni et al 2020 xiao and zhao 2017 besides cytochrome c and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nadh play critical roles in microbial extracellular and intracellular electron transfer processes xiao and zhao 2017 zhang et al 2021b several studies have shown that the eps and microbial composition on the eab biofilm could be influenced and even reshaped due to substrate limitation and the exposure of different toxicants hou et al 2020 li et al 2021 it has been reported that nanoparticles silver can affect the microbial composition of anodic biofilm eps composition and eet associated genes zakaria and dhar 2020 as wastewater nowadays may contain a substantial amount of mps it could probably influence the electrochemical activity and microbiology of eab biofilm in the process of wastewater treatment which has never been reported in this study for the first time the impact of polyethylene mps pe mp on the exoelectrogenic biofilm and the associated extracellular electron transfer processes and the underlying mechanisms were explored the response of the electrogenesis biofilm to mps was investigated in terms of electrochemical characteristics biofilm morphology eps composition and microbial community structure lastly the variation of eab abundance eet associated genes and protein was analyzed this study may shed light on the evolution of electroactive bacteria and biofilm and resilience of the associated engineered processes systems under specific environmental stress 2 methods and materials 2 1 sources of inoculum and pe mp wastewater from lundtofte municipal wastewater treatment plant lyngby denmark was used as the inoculum in the mess the chemical oxygen demand cod total solids and ammonium nitrogen from the wastewater were 300 3 53 and 2 12 mg l respectively polyethylene is one of the most ubiquitous polymers in water bodies

previously described yang et al 2021 the anode 5 5 8 cm3 and cathode 5 5 8 cm3 chamber were separated by a cation exchange membrane cmi 70 001 membrane international nj the membrane was immersed in a 5 nacl solution for 12 h to allow for membrane hydration and expansion this preconditioning procedure can also improve the diffusion permeability berezina et al 2008 xu et al 2021 a carbon fiber brush diameter 5 0 cm length 5 0 cm mill rose usa pretreated at 450 c for 30 min was used as anode and a titanium woven wire mesh 4 5 4 5 cm was used as cathode cathode was coated with 0 5 mg cm2 platinum

the setup process the anode of both mfcs and mecs were filled with wastewater together with 1 g l sodium acetate and 50 mm phosphate buffer solution pbs the catholyte of mfcs was a solution containing

circuit model according to previous methods wang et al 2020a 2 3 3 the extraction and analysis of eps a heating method was used to extract different eps fractions from the anode biofilm at the end of the experiment li et al 2021 the carbon brush with biofilm was rinsed in 0 9 nacl and then heated at 70 c for 30 min followed by centrifuging at 10 750 g for 15 min the suspension was collected and filtered through a 0 22 µm filter as loosely bound eps lb eps the carbon brush left in the centrifuge tube was then resuspended in 0 9 nacl and 5 na2 edta then shaken at 180 rpm for 4 h the collected suspension was filtered and obtained as tightly bound eps tb eps the eps obtained above were characterized with excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy eems were measured using an aqualog fluorometer horiba to show the changes of lb eps and tb eps absorbance and fluorescence excitation was measured from 240 to 600 nm in 3 nm increments fluorescence emission was recorded with a charge coupled device from 220 to 620 nm at an increment of approximately 3 3 nm at integration times of 1 3 s samples with absorbance exceeding 1 5 cm 1 were diluted before measurements data were processed in matlab the mathworks inc using the dreem toolbox v0 6 3 as follows murphy et al 2013 raw data were imported and blanks subtracted from the sample fluorescence inner filter effects were

excised and interpolated excised 1st and 2nd order scatter and interpolated only 2nd order scatter fluorescence intensities were extracted at predefined wavelength pairs according to established procedures coble 2007 2 3 4 biofilm viability observations live dead cells were visualized to evaluate the viability of biofilm on the surface of the anodic carbon brush under different pe mp concentrations the carbon brush samples were collected in triplicate for each reactor at the end of the experiment the viability of the biofilm on the carbon brush was observed using the confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm leica tcs sp5 germany before the observations the biofilm samples were rinsed with 50 mm pbs then stained with a live dead baclight bacterial viability kit invitrogen carlsbad ca united states and incubated in the dark for 15 min and afterward rinsed with 50 mm pbs twice to remove the residual fluorochrome the biofilm was measured under the z stack mode the green and red dyes of syto 9 and propidium iodide were used to stain the live and dead cells which could emit green and dead fluorescence respectively the excitation and emission for syto 9 are 488 nm and 500 550 nm for propidium iodide are 561 nm and 570 650 nm the mean fluorescence intensity was calculated from the triplicate samples based on the corresponding clsm data the three dimensional biofilm was reconstructed using imaris software version 7 4 2 the ratio between live cells and dead cells was calculated using the green and red fluorescence intensity data robertson et al 2019 2 4 microbial community analysis the total microbial dna was extracted from the biofilm using a fastdna spin kit for soil qiagen ca usa the bacterial 16s rrna genes at v4 v5 hypervariable regions were amplified

similarity level the sequence taxonomies were generated by an rdp classifier referring to silva release132 http www arb silva de 16s rrna database alpha diversity and the rarefaction curves were conducted using mothur software version v 1 30 1 at a 0 97 similarity level 2 5 quantification of functional genes and electron transfer mechanism the electron transfer related genes were quantified in triplicate through a real time quantitative pcr detecting system abi 7500 applied biosystems usa including pila and mtrc he et al 2021 zakaria and dhar 2020 the primers of these genes were listed in table s1 electron transfer relevant enzymes including cytochrome c extracellular and nadh intracellular were extracted and measured based on volatile suspended solids vss following the previous procedure zhang et al 2021a 2 6 statistical analysis all data were represented as mean sem standard error of the mean partial least squares discriminant analysis pls da was performed between mfcs and mecs using the r package mixomics version 3 3 1 circos was visualized through circos software http circos ca the co network analysis was drawn using gephi based on the spearman correlations data output from the r psych package the p value 0 05 was regarded as statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrochemical response of exoelectrogenic biofilm to pe mp the performance of electrogenesis biofilm under different pe mp concentrations was investigated in terms of current density output and cod removal efficiency in mfcs and mecs fig 1 a shows that different pe mp concentrations did not significantly influence the current density output from mfcs however in the mecs mode the maximum current density decreased with the increase of pe mp concentration 1 99 1 37 and 0 74 a m2 at 0 25 and 75 mg l respectively fig 1b in the mfcs the current was generated from the acetate oxidation by the mature biofilm zhang et al 2011 in this case the pe mp might influence only a part of mature biofilm which was not sufficient to affect the current response while in the mecs the current was influenced by the internal resistance at a given applied voltage cario et al 2019 thus the decreased current would result from the increased internal resistance in the presence of pe mp this result was consistent with the previous study which reported the decreased volumetric current density with the exposure of silver nanoparticles in mecs zakaria and dhar 2020 at the end of the batch run the cod removal efficiency of mfcs with pe mp was 57 65 8 04 mfc75 and 61 93 10 25 mfc25 which was lower than that without pe mp exposure 63 22 0 77 mfc0 fig s1a similar trends were observed in mecs fig s1b the cod removal efficiency corresponded with the activity of electrogenesis biofilm which pe mp is likely to influence fig s2a and s2b showed no significant oxidation reduction peaks during forward and reverse scans however the reactor without pe mp showed higher current generation than that with pe mp exposure in both mfcs and mecs eis was performed to measure the impedance of mess through the nyquist plot of the anode electrode the electrode potential loss mainly include ohmic loss activated loss and mass transfer loss which represent the rs rct and rd respectively the nyquist plots are shown in fig 1c the total resistance calculated from the equivalent circuit model increased from 8 33 ω in mfc0 to 301 33 ω in mfc25 and from 35 47 ω in mec0 to 91 46 ω in mec75 fig 1d it is clear that the resistance of rct contributed most of the total resistance and the resistance increased under the influence of pe mp this demonstrated the mass transfer was down with a lower electron transfer capability ren et al 2019 the toxic of pe mp might also inhibit some bacteria and increase the mass transfer resistance previous research showed that the metal anode deposited nanoparticles can decrease the charge transfer resistances by improving the conductivity of the electrode wang et al 2019 however in this study the presence of non conductive pe mp increased the rct from 6 42 ω mfc0 to 79 97 ω mfc75 and from 28 48 ω to 83 81 ω in mec0 and mec75 besides the toxic of the pe mp might increase the population of dead cells resulting in increasing of the electron transfer distance and the charge transfer resistance wang et al 2020a the results might be ascribed to the influence of pe mp on the activity and viability of the electrogenic biofilm and the weakened eet process in the future studies catalyst free cathode could be employed to reduce the capital costs for the treatment alvarez gallego et al 2012 pasupuleti et al 2016 overall the multiplexed conductive pathway could be weakened by pe mp in mess 3 2 effect of pe mp on biofilm viability the viability of the anodic biofilm under different pe mp levels was investigated through clsm imaging fig 2 a c and fig 2d f represent the clsm z stack images for mfcs and mecs respectively results showed that a low concentration of mp 25 mg l promoted the biofilm viability in mfcs but when the mps concentration increased to 75 mg l the biofilm viability decreased significantly to further assess the distribution of dead and live cells the fluorescence intensity and ratio between live and dead cells based on fluorescence intensity were calculated fig 2g and h in mfcs the live and dead cells fluorescence intensity all increased at a 25 mg l pe mp and then decreased in higher concentration of pe mp however there was a clear decline of the ratio between live and dead cell with pe mp concentration increased from 0 to 75 mg l fig 2h with the ratio of dead cells increased from 31 66 1 24 to 49 72 0 34 low concentration of pe mp promoted the growth of biofilm bacteria which was consistent with previous report that the mps derived nutrients contributed to bacterial growth chen et al 2021 the reduction of live cells fluorescence intensity and ratio of live cells was observed when the concentration of pe mp increased in mecs the occurrence of pe mp could hinder the growth of biofilm in mecs and result in a higher ratio of dead cells increasing from 37 50 0 65 to 49 15 3 22 with pe mp concentration increased from 0 to 75 mg l high mps will be more harmful to microbiology activities result in cell dysfunction and inhibit the growth of some functional bacteria previous studies have unraveled that polyethylene terephthalate mps and polyvinyl chloride mps posed toxicity to the viability of the cell via toxic leachate from microplastics which would result in cell death wei et al 2021 zhang et al 2020a it has also been reported that the mps in marine could cause negative effects on the organism sun et al 2018 same with our study the growth of exoelectrogenic microbes and their attachment to the electrode was inhibited at higher mps concentration because of the toxicities agree with the overlay clsm fig s3 the presence of more dead cells might affect the eet process since the electron product from the live cells had to transfer over the dead cells to the electrode sun et al 2015 the death cells layer could increase the electrode resistance which was also shown from the eis result that the relative higher dead cells resulting in a relative high resistant liang et al 2011 the mfc75 showed relatively lower dead cells and thus the internal resistance was relatively lower than that of mfc25 3 3 eps distribution in the exoelectrogenic biofilm the abundance of eps could reveal the performance of anodic biofilm li et al 2021 thus fluorescence spectroscopy was used to fingerprint lb eps and tb eps in the processed eps samples fig s4 and 3 optical fingerprints distinguished between the different eps fractions and experimental treatments fig s5 it has been well documented that the difference among various types of eps resulted from the functional particular components distribution li et al 2021 the lightly bound eps can easily be loose under the influence of the pe mp and the tb eps was more stably attached to the exoelectrogenic bacteria he et al 2019 this is the reason why they clustered differently as shown in fig 3a f two main peaks peak t and peak c were observed at ex em of 275 330 nm and 337 447 nm which was assumed to be a proxy for protein like and humic like fractions li et al 2016 wei et al 2016 the normalized fi of each peak was summarized to examine qualitative variation of the substrates the fi of peak t for tb eps was reduced with different doses of mps in mfcs a similar result was observed for mecs except for a slight increase when it varied from mec25 0 77 0 29 to mec75 1 09 0 34 fig 3a f and s4g previous observation of protein production in eps showed that protein could be promoted under microbial electrochemical cultivation process or the suitable anode potential and was likely being involved in the eet process hou et al 2020 li et al 2021 the distinct suppression in the eps protein has also been previously demonstrated in anaerobic methane recovery experiment with polyvinyl chloride mps exposure zhang et al 2020a here pe mp might inhibit the protein production in the electroactive bacteria and thereby weakening the eet process in mess also the decreasing of the eps under the influence of pe mp could expose the bacteria to the outside toxic chemicals resulting in cells death and thereby weakening the performance of the electroactive bacteria similarly more markedly reduced peak t could be observed for lb eps fig s4a f as the lightly bound eps the lb eps was more easily influenced with the exposure of pe mp humic substances have been well known as the electron mediators involved in the indirect eet pathway and it can also shift the community structure xiao and zhao 2017 it seems no compositional changes in the area of peak c humic like substrates according to the fluorescence in mfcs fig 3a c and s4h thus the pe mp seems did not play a critical role in changing the content of humic like substrates in mfcs comparatively pe mp affected the humic like substrate in mecs fig 3d f s4h the peak c with the higheer lb eps in mecs fig s4d f thus mps might first affect the protein and humic like substrates composition in eps which was demonstrated as an important substance for the electrochemical activity of the biofilm in mess xiao and zhao 2017 furthermore the exposed bacteria might be inhibited by the toxic compounds from the pe mp which would also be the reason for the increased dead cells ratio when pe mp existed detailed mechanism analysis are required in future studies to reveal the synergistic interactions among mps eps and electroactive biofilm 3 4 the effect of mps on the microbial community of exoelectrognic biofim a total of 420 otus were identified from all the samples with a 97 sequence similarity rarefaction curves showed that the microbial richness exposure to pe mp decreased compared to the control fig 4 a similarly decrease in richness was found through chao 1 and ace estimator table 1 the richness of bacterial communities on pe mp has also been reported lower than that in natural substrates miao et al 2019 the presence of microplastics would be toxic to the cell growth which could also be reflected by the decreased cell viability and eps microbial diversity shannon estimator increased in mfcs with pe mp from 2 198 mfc0 to 2 759 mfc25 and 2 550 mfc75 but declined in mecs table 1 indicating that some microbial communities are sensitive to the pe mp toxic effects zhang and chen 2020b in addition pls da was conducted to evaluate the microbial community structure alterations and reveal whether there are differences among different group samples a clear difference between mfcs and mecs were existed indicating the varied community structures under different modes fig 4b remarkable cluster for mec25 and mec75 showing the species selectivity from pe mp in mecs previous research has also demonstrated the obvious different microbial communities between plastic and non plastic substrates miao et al 2019 the identified otus were assigned to 21 phyla 293 genus and 361 species the composition of phylum among these six samples was presented in fig 4c using circos the five most abundant phyla were proteobacteria bacteroidota actinobacteriota firmicutes and desulfobacterota as the most abundant phyla proteobacteria showed an increasing trend in mfcs with the pe mp concentrations increase specifically it increased from 63 21 in mec0 to 78 50 mec25 and 85 42 mec75 the relative abundance of firmicutes also increased with the pe mp in both mfcs 5 13 to 6 26 and mecs 5 21 to 7 13 however significant decrease could be found in mecs for phyla actinobacteriota decreasing from 13 82 in mec0 to 11 87 in mec25 and 1 76 in mec75 the 50 most abundant genera from the microbial communities of six samples were shown as heatmap in fig s6 the several high abundant genera are widely found in mess such as acinetobacter bacteroidales no rank at genus level dechlorosoma and desulfovibrio wang et al 2020a zakaria and dhar 2020 zhang et al 2021b functional genera of eab were selected and visualized using a heatmap fig 4d as one of the most famous eab geobacter could oxidize acetate and release electricity in mess kimura and okabe 2013 in the mecs the abundance of geobacter decreased from 6 49 mec0 to 0 71 mec25 and 0 05 mec75 with increasing of the pe mp concentration however in mfcs the abundance increased slightly in mfc25 and then it decreased to the same level as mfc0 and mfc75 mycobacterium was also weakened in mec25 1 38 and mec75 0 12 compared with that without pe mp 8 03 in mec0 it has been reported that mycobacterium has the ability of eet jin et al 2018 a decreased trend could also be found in mecs for genus comamonas that is capable of electron transfer yang et al 2019 with the increasing of pe mp concentration romboutsia which was reported as potential electricigens in soil mfcs li et al 2018 decreased not only in mecs 0 96 to 0 32 but also in mfcs 0 62 to 0 08 besides the bioelectricity generation related genus clostridium sensu stricto 13 and dysgonomonas in mfcs shrank with pe mp li et al 2018 tian et al 2017 when comparison of the abundance in all mfcs it was observed that some genera in mfc25 had a higher abundance than mfc0 and also mfc75 which include geobacter desulfovibrio clostridium sensu stricto 1 parabacteroides bacillus and pseudomonas the results indicated that the low level pe mp might motivate the growth of some electrogenic bacteria this phenomenon could also be reflected in the cv curve and the clsm analysis fig s2a and 2b among all the functional genus bacillus was the only one who was reported that could generate electricity and degrade polyethylene plastics auta et al 2017 islam et al 2017 so the low concentration of pe mp might serve as the substrate and increase the growth of bacillus while the high concentration might have toxicity to the cells the above results demonstrated that the presence of pe mp could alter the anodic microbial communities esspecially the ones are known for eet it is still not clear about the distribution pattern of eab and the interaction between pe mps concentrations and all the biofilm community thus co occurrence network analysis were constructed among pe mp concentrations marked as mps the summary abundance of the exoelectrogenic bacteria marked as eab here and the abundance of all otus from different modes of samples the eab was summarized as one consortium to easily evaluate the relationship between eab as a total community and the individual otus in mfcs the interaction of total eab abundance pe mp concentrations and 314 otus was visualized in fig 5 a showing significant spearman correlations p 0 05 among all the otus nodes 86 nodes with 85 pairs of edges were identified significantly response to the abundance of eab and pe mp concentrations notably 38 outs showed negative correlations with pe mp concentrations 38 red edges higher than that between eab and otus 14 red edges the positive relationships were less than those two indicating that the pe mp concentrations and eab consortium have a more negative influence on the correlated otus in mfcs there are 109 otus nodes and 213 significant correlations between eab mps and otus in the network of mecs fig 5b most of the correlations related to pe mp were negative 82 red edges while most of the eab related relationships were positive 81 blue edges these observations suggested that pe mp concentrations had a remarkable negative effect on the microbial taxon in mfcs and mecs this showed that the toxic effect of pe mp on the eam growth it has been previously reported that the polyvinyl chloride mps could negatively influence the content of some key acidogens and methanogens in anaerobic digestion systems zhang et al 2020a this was consistent with the observation of the low clsm intensity in mfc75 and mec75 fig 2c and 2f and low richness reflected by rarefaction curves fig 4a 3 5 quantification of functional genes and eet mechanisms in mess the current generation is determined by the eet capability of the anodic microbial communities wang and ren 2013 the effect of mps on the exoelectrogenic biofilm could be reflected through the transform of the eet pathway thus the expression level of two essential genes related to eet process was evaluated including pila and mtrc he et al 2021 zakaria and dhar 2020 quantitative pcr results revealed that the abundance of these two functional genes appeared higher in the samples without pe mp mfc0 and mec0 mec75 harbored the lowest abundance of the plia gene while it was similar between mec0 and mec25 there was a decline trend of the mtrc gene with the pe mp concentrations increased from 0 to 75 mg l in mfcs from 1 87 0 01 to 1 75 0 01 log copies ng dna and mecs from 1 99 0 03 to 1 68 0 03 log copies ng dna when the exoelectrogenic biofilm was exposed to the pe mp the expression of the eet related genes was inhibited which down the electron transfer enzymes the reduced gene with mps exposure would result from the low percentage of eab according to fig 4d as the membrane bound redox protein cytochrome c plays a key role in eet process xiao and zhao 2017 in the mfcs the highest abundant cytochrome c was found in mfc25 5 18 1 03 mg g vss while mfc75 2 77 0 62 mg g vss has the lowest level the resulst imply that the low concentration of pe mp could accelerate the eet while the high content of pe mp would inhibit it the clsm and eab abundance analysis also confirmed the rich bacteria grow on the surface of the anode in mfc25 fig 2a and 2d in contrast cytochrome c content in mecs sharply dropped with the presence of pe mp similar as the circuit current shown in fig 1b the gene encoded cytochrome c could be the electron shuttle assisting the transfer of electrons meanwhile cytochrome c containing subunit ii was reported to decrease with polyethersulfone mps addition in the nitrifying process qin et al 2020 thus the drop of cytochrome c in exoelectrogenic biofilm may result from the low expression of electrogenic genes and the abundance of eab in the previous case c type cytochrome expression could be influenced under intermittent electro driving electrochemical biofilms wang et al 2020a it hinted at the different results in different mess as the intracellular electron carrier nadh was facilitated in the mfcs with the occurrence of pe mp while it was repressed in mecs fig 6 b although electrons could be transported through nadh dehydrogenase it is difficult to identify the influence of pe mp on nadh in mess rabaey and verstraete 2005 in this study we could elucidate that the electron carriers were upregulated with pe mp in mfcs but it turned to the opposite in mecs 4 conclusions in this study the influence of pe mp on the electrogenic bacteria in mfcs and mecs was demonstrated for the first time it was found that the current density showed no significant difference with the occurrence of pe mp in mfcs but decreased with the increase of pe mp concentration in mecs besides the presence of pe mp decreased the cod removal efficiency while it increased the resistance of anode biofilm in both systems a low concentration of pe mps could enhance exoelectrogens viability in mfcs but the high content of pe mp may suppress the viability in both mfcs and mecs in addition the ratio of the dead cell increased from 31 66 1 24 to 49 72 0 34 in the mfcs and from 37 50 0 65 to 49 15 3 22 in the mecs reflecting a toxic effect of mps on the exoelectrogens biofilm the presence of pe mps decreased the protein content in eps moreover the richness of the microbial communities in the biofilm decreased with the increase of pe mp level eab abundance increased after adding 25 mg l mps in mfcs but it dropped with pe mp in mecs furthermore most of the mp related otus were significantly negative with pe mp according to co network the effect of microplastics on eet related genes and membrane bound cytochrome c was evaluated for the first time in this study the reduction of the eet would decrease the efficiency of the microbial electrochemical processes this is the first study revealing the role of microplastics in the microbial electrochemical systems treating wastewater the results will address an intriguing question in science add to knowledge on environmental impact of microplastics provide new knowledge for researchers to steer and shape the microbial community to resistant the microplastics toxicity for efficient eet and conductive biofilm development when treating wastewater rich in microplastics this knowledge

water industries for decades as the sludge contains a high fraction of nutrients such as nitrogen n it has been estimated that the use of sewage sludge can be a promising alternative to 30 n containing chemical fertilizer when fully applied raheem et al 2018 recently for resource recovery and agricultural development an increasing number of researches have focused on the production of n containing plant growth promoting nutrients n pgpn from the sewage sludge he et al 2015 soobhany 2019 tang et al 2021 these compounds were usually existed in the forms of humic substances proteins and protein hydrolysis products such as peptides amino acids ammonia etc and they are believed to be the key components for facilitating plant growth tejada et al 2013 moreover in the organic waste treatment amino acids have been found to be the important substrate to produce n containing plant growth promoting biostimulants n pgpb i e the phytohormones and allelochemicals that show well leveraged effects on regulating the nutrient uptake by plants and their tolerance to abiotic stress qi et al 2018 scaglia et al 2015 2017 thus the amino acids in sewage sludge can also be expected to be transferred to valuable n pgpb products in the practice of agriculture application the direct application of sewage sludge is limited by the existence of putrescible organic matter pathogenic organisms and heavy metals kelessidis and stasinakis 2012 yang et al 2015 therefore in recent years increasing attention has been paid to the liquid fertilizer produced from sludge by collecting sludge dewatering liquor hereinafter referred to as sludge liquor and the application of sludge liquor to the farmland was easier than sludge itself thermal hydrolysis th treatment has been investigated for producing liquid fertilizer from sewage sludge tampio et al 2016 as it could improve sludge dewaterability and the temperature condition above 120 c could sterilize pathogens barber 2016 moreover th treatment could facilitate the solubilization of sludge particulates as well as the release of n containing compounds due to its effects on the depolymerization and cleavage of chemical bonds zhang et al 2020 a recent study has also demonstrated that the phytohormone of indole 3 acetic acid could be produced from waste activated sludge by th lu et al 2021 however th may have negative effects such as the uncontrolled release of heavy metals lu et al 2021 xue et al 2015 and the easily occurred maillard reaction which hindered the usage of released nutrients by forming melanoidins rodríguez abalde et al 2011 the recently developed alkaline thermal hydrolysis ath treatment may be superior to th for producing higher quality liquid fertilizer from the sludge during ath treatment the ph of sludge samples would be increased and the bacterial surface become increasingly negatively charged as a result more extracellular polymeric substances eps can be desorbed from sludge flocs due to high electrostatic repulsion katsiris and kouzeli katsiri 1987 moreover at extremely high ph values 11 the cell lysis may occur as it cannot maintain an appropriate turgor pressure kim et al 2010 tan et al 2012 both the enhanced destroy of eps and possible cell lysis may generate more n pgpn as well as precursors of n pgpb for producing high liquid fertilizer however the potential and regulation mechanisms of ath treatment on the recovery of n pgpn and n pgpb from sewage sludge have not yet been studied additionally previous researches mainly focused on the transformation of inorganic n during sludge treatment however compared to n pgpn and n pgpb mainly in the form of organic n the inorganic n is easy to lose due to the irrigation after application yuan et al 2018 thus how to maximize the generation of n pgpn and n pgpb and reduce the formation of inorganic n during liquid fertilizer production also remains a research gap therefore the aims of this study are to investigate the feasibility of using ath treatment to produce the high quality liquid fertilizer containing n pgpn and n pgpb the effect of ath treatment on n pgpn and n pgpb production from sewage sludge and the mechanisms involved were explored on this basis the regulation strategies for maximizing their production were proposed the ca oh 2 was used as the alkaline compound for ath treatment in this study although it was less effective than naoh in protein solubilization li et al 2008 the usage of ca oh 2 has many other advantages such as low cost ease of storage and sludge dewaterability after treatment li et al 2014 the n pgpn and n pgpb recovery from the sludge by th treatment was also tested as a comparison in addition a field study of crop planting using liquor fertilizer produced from ath treatment was conducted for validating its effectiveness 2 materials and methods 2 1 sewage sludge and experimental design for sludge treatments the raw sludge rs was collected from a municipal sewage treatment plant in changsha china which is the thickened sludge containing 90 of secondary sludge and 10 of primary sludge the rs had a high total solids ts content by 201 2 0 4 g kg but a low ratio of volatile solids to ts vs ts 326 9 2 7 g kg which is a typical characteristic of sludge produced from wwtps in the south of china cieślik et al 2015 qu et al 2019 yang et al 2015 the experiment was designed to obtain the liquid products from alkaline thermal hydrolysis ath and thermal hydrolysis treatment th of sewage sludge and the temperature of thermal treatments was designed from 100 to 180 c in brief the experimental unit for thermal treatment was a 300 ml hydrolysis reactor consisting of an inner polytetrafluoroethylene container and a vessel made of stainless steel 150 g homogenized sewage sludge was put in each inner container and the reactors were then sealed carefully and heated in an electronic oven for ath the 150 g sludge was mixed with ca oh 2 around 0 2 g g ts to adjust ph to 12 5 0 5 before thermal treatments the thermal reactions in the hydrolysis reactor were progressed in autogenously saturated pressure corresponding to different temperatures and the start point was recorded when the oven reached the preset temperature 100 c 120 c 140 c 160 c and 180 c after the duration of 4 h reactions were stopped and the reactors were cooled down in ice water taking 60 90 min afterward the reactors were opened and the slurry was centrifuged at 8000 r min for 20 mins the sludge liquor was collected and used for soluble components analyses and the extraction method of extracellular polymeric substances from the precipitate was described by xu et al 2018 2 2 characterizations of the solid and liquid fraction of sludge samples after treatments sludge solubilization was described in terms of chemical oxygen demand cod solubilization and volatile solids vs reduction cod solubilization was defined as the ratio between the increase of insoluble cod due to ath or th treatments and the initial particulate cod which was shown in eq 1 the vs reduction rate was determined as the difference between the vs content in rs and that in the solid fraction obtained after centrifugation which was shown in eq 2 1 cod solu bili zati on 100 cods cod s r cod t r cod s r where total cod of rs and the cod value in the soluble phase are called codtr and cods respectively while the cods determined in rs is codsr 2 vs reduction 100 v s r m r v s p m p where the vsr vsp mr and mp are the volatile solids content and the mass of rs and the precipitate from the treated slurry respectively the liquid products obtained after ath and th were filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane the fertilizer properties of the liquor were tested in terms of n recovery and seed germination index gi the contents of total soluble nitrogen tsn nh4 n no3 n were measured according to the standard methods apha 2005 total soluble organic nitrogen son concentrations were calculated by the difference of tsn and total inorganic nitrogen species nh4 n and no3 n he et al 2015 the gi was used to evaluate the biostimulant effects of the liquid products on seed germination and the early development of plants to adjust the ph value in sludge liquor within the range of 9 5 10 0 all the samples were diluted 120 times before gi testes details of gi assays have been reported in tang et al 2018 the gi was calculated as eq 3 3 gi 100 g r a s l g r b a s l b where gr is the seed germination rate in sludge liquors grb is the seed germination rate in the blank sample i e deionized water asl is the average shoot length in sludge liquors and aslb is the average shoot length in the blank sample i e deionized water the liquid samples were characterized in terms of weight average molecular weight mw distribution and fourier transform infrared ftir spectra the mw was determined using a high performance liquid chromatograph 1260 infinity agilent santa clara ca usa equipped with a pl aquagel oh mixed m column 8 μm 300 7 5 mm agilent and a refractive index detector for ftir a mixture of 1 2 mg of freeze dried eps and 100 mg of potassium bromide kbr ir grade was ground and pressed to obtain pellets after using a spectrometer nicolet 5700 nicolet waltham ma usa to scan from 400 to 4000 cm 1 the sum of the ftir absorbance was normalized and multiplied by 1000 2d correlation spectroscopy was conducted by 2dshige software kwansei gakuin university japan 2 3 quantitative determination of n pgpn and n pgpb 2 3 1 determination of n pgpn the concentration of n pgpn i e soluble protein spn and soluble humic acids sha of liquid samples were analyzed using an enzyme labeled instrument elx800 biotek us following the modified lowry method frolund et al 1995 for the quantification of pn and ha in eps the extracted eps was solubilized in deionized water and adjusted to ph 8 0 for free amino acids faas the extraction and detection procedures were according to chen et al 2019 the final faas determination used ultra performance liquid chromatography waters acquity uplc hclass usa 2 3 2 lc ms ms detection of n pgpb phytohormones the phytohormone determination in previous studies was widely based on the data from lc detection however the lc coupled with mass spectrometry such as lc ms or lc ms ms should be applied to ensure the quantification to be well targeted according to reports about the identification and quantification of phytohormones in algae and plants using lc ms ms prinsen et al 1998 yalçın et al 2019 the extraction and detection procedures of phytohormones in sludge liquor were adjusted to the recovery rate in the range of 90 110 in brief 2 000 g of each sample was mixed with 0 40 g edta 2na and acetonitrile phosphate buffer solution with ph 3 0 before oscillating vortex at room temperature for 2 min ultrasonic centrifugation and rotary evaporation the remaining liquid was rotated and purified by sax hlb series solid phase extraction column from each sample 2 μl of the supernatant was injected into the lc system for the condition for ms detection the cone and desolvation gas flow source temperature and de solvation temperature and cone voltage for the electrospray ionization were set as 800 l h 1 150 and 450 c 30 00 v respectively more details for instrument parameters can be checked in the supplementary information 2 3 3 gc ms detection allelochemicals classified in n pgpb and intermediates for n pgpb the extraction and detection were according to previous reports for dissolved organic samples scaglia et al 2016 scaglia et al 2015 2017 and details can be checked in the supplementary information for initial gc ms data analysis which was processed using chromatof v 4 34 leco st joseph mi including the integration normalization and alignment of the peak intensities the selected spectra were then elaborated to subtract the internal standard sample peaks and to semi quantitatively calculate the molecule concentrations by direct comparison with the internal standard peak area 2 4 field study of the production and land application of sludge ath liquor the sewage sludge from a municipal wwtp in rugao china ssrg was used for liquid fertilizer production and planting test under field conditions ssrg also showed a high total solids ts content by 189 7 1 3 g kg but a low ratio of volatile solids to ts vs ts 301 7 5 3 which were similar to characteristics of rs used in lab scale the 150 kg ssrg was mixed with 0 15 0 20 g g ts lime and treated in an ath system yuezichun nantong china the set temperature of the ath system was 120 c which is the highest for safe operation due to the limitation of the device the actual temperature in the system may fluctuate in the range of 120 140 c the liquor products were collected after dewatering the treated sludge using a plate and frame type filter press jingjin china the effects of ath treatment on the recovery of n the production of n pgpn and n pgpb as well as metal reduction shown in liquor liquorrg were tested the obtained liquid fertilizer was then used for field planting test with 133 500 plants of soybean glycine max l merr per hm2 the liquorrg was diluted 100 times and applied on roots twice in aug 2019 and on the leaf surface once in sep 2019 crop quantity and crop quality in the experimental group nourished using liquorrg were compared to those using commercialized urea sinochem group china with equal n supply data of crop growth in field study were provided by nantong yuezichun biological agriculture technology co ltd 2 5 other analyses the measurements of ts vs ph electrical conductivity cod and the digestion of rs sample and liquid products before metals determination were according to standard methods apha 2005 the determination of polyvalent metals and harmful metals for fertilizer were analyzed using icp oes aglient 5110 all samples used for analyses were performed in triplicates measurement data were all shown as mean standard deviation all the analyses were performed with ibm spss statistics 23 for windows ibm corp ny usa a p value 0 05 was considered statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 sludge reduction and cod solubilization after ath treatment the vs reduction and cod solubilization were investigated to evaluate the overall potential of nutrient release from sewage sludge after ath treatments the vs reduction ratio after ath and th treatment were compared in fig 1 a the results showed that after ath at 100 140 c the vs reduction reached 15 7 35 9 which were more than twice higher than that after th at the same temperature in the temperature range of 160 180 c the values of vs reduction were stable by 37 6 38 0 after ath likely due to that the sludge solubilization already finished at the low temperatures but still the reduction ratios were about 1 4 1 5 times higher than those after th notably the sewage sludge with a low vs ts below 35 which is considered unsuitable for the biotreatment process cieślik et al 2015 yang et al 2015 in which case the ath can be regarded as a promising method for separating organic resources from the sludge as for cod solubilization fig 1b the value obtained after ath at 100 c was slightly lower than that from th this can be attributed to the negative effect of ca2 which could re flocculate dissolved organic polymers li et al 2008 however when the temperature increased from 120 c to 160 c the cod solubilization after ath was 127 3 147 3 of that from th while when the temperature further increased to 180 c the intergroup difference of cod solubilization decreased this suggested that the effects of ca oh 2 on promoting nutrient release were mainly significant at a medium temperature range of 120 160 c 3 2 physiochemical characteristics and fertilizing effect of sludge liquor produced after ath treatment n species and concentrations are important chemical parameters of fertilizers which in the sludge liquor generated after ath and th treatments hereinafter referred to as ath liquor and th liquor were tested and compared in fig 2 overall the ath treatment was superior to th treatment in releasing n from the sewage sludge and maintaining organic n in the liquor products specifically n solubilization was limited by the single th treatment the maximal total soluble n tsn in th liquor was 1 710 g l at 180 c and the ratio of which to total n tn in rs tsn tn was only 24 25 this result can be regarded as normal effects of th on n recovery reported in the literature lu et al 2021 wang et al 2018 wilson and novak 2009 the ath treatment on the other hand significantly enhanced n solubilization the tsn in ath liquor increased to 3 472 3 976 g l at 140 180 c and the tsn tn enlarged to more than 54 the tsn content achieved by ath at 180 c was 2 32 times that achieved by th at the same temperature in terms of soluble organic n son which occupied a stable proportion in tsn son tsn by 81 94 80 19 after ath at 100 180 c while that from th gradually decreased from 89 90 to 70 54 after treatments at 100 180 c it has been reported that son could be accelerated to convert into ammonia under high temperatures with the cleavage in amines and the destruction of the peptide bonds wang et al 2018 wilson and novak 2009 possible explanations for the greater retention of son in ath treatment were that the organic n solubilization under the ath conditions could catch up with the son mineralization and or the deamination may reduce due to the presence of ca2 which is functional for forming bridges between amino acids flemming and wingender 2010 therefore the enhanced organic n release and maintenance were beneficial for higher n pgpn and n pgpb production and accumulation in ath liquor the ph and electrical conductivity ec in ath and th liquor were listed in table 1 the ph values were stable as 12 51 12 68 ath and 7 12 7 05 th after treatments at 100 120 c while clear ph reductions occurred when the temperature was heating upon and over 140 c the ph reduction suggested the enhanced depolymerization and cleavage degree of chemical bonds in sludge organics resulting in the release of amino acids and fatty acids zhang et al 2020 as for the application of liquid fertilizer the recommended ph condition is weakly alkaline ph of 8 9 5 tampio et al 2016 so the sludge liquor may require a more than 100 fold dilution before land application electrical conductivity is a useful parameter to track the change of soluble salts resulting from organic degradation and immobilization bustamante et al 2012 the electrical conductivity values in liquor of ath were more than three times of that th at 100 140 c further indicating the advantage of ath on sludge hydrolysis at low temperatures however a decreasing trend of electrical conductivity can be found in ath at 140 180 c this was likely due to the increasing insoluble salts formed by hydrophobic materials and metals which were easy to be separated after centrifugation correspondingly as seen in table 2 compared with th ath at 140 180 c was functional to reduce the release of polyvalent metals mg al zn ni fe mn cu and harmful metals cr as cd pb hg and whose concentrations were far less than the content limits in many regulations such as german fertilizer ordinance 2015 and chinese agriculture standard 2010 the germination index gi was used to assess the fertilizing effect of the sludge liquor which was also listed in table 1 as a high electrical conductivity value may pose an inhibitory effect on seed germination tang et al 2018 and the level of 1 50 ms cm 1 is considered as the threshold for the healthy growth of bio media nurdiawati et al 2018 all liquid samples were diluted to having the same salinity around 0 50 ms cm 1 before gi tests the results showed that ath at 120 180 c can produce liquor products with a higher seed germination index gi 103 119 than that from the control sample 100 suggesting positive effects on seedling and early plant growth specifically the highest gi was observed at ath 160 by 119 which was almost twice that of raw sludge 61 on the contrary gi levels in samples from th were all below 100 and decreased as the temperature rose indicating the increase of phytotoxic factors such as salinity tracked by the increase of electrical conductivity rather than the fertilizing effect with the increase of temperature 3 3 the production of n pgpn in sludge liquor by ath treatment soluble proteins spn and soluble humic acids sha were two main n pgpn in sludge liquor products with spn concentrations about 1 9 9 2 times higher than sha as shown in fig 3 a spn and sha were very limited in rs by 0 62 and 0 02 g l respectively after th treatment at 100 180 c the spn and sha concentrations increased to 3 50 7 81 g l and 0 34 0 93 g l respectively which correspondingly accounted for 12 3 27 5 and 27 7 75 2 of pn and ha in the eps of rs compared with th treatment the ath treatment presented the higher effectiveness in n pgpn solubilization at the temperature range of 120 180 c and the spn and sha concentration could correspondingly reach 6 74 9 27 g l and 1 34 2 15 g l especially at low temperatures when compared to th treatment the enhancement of spn 120 c and sha 140 c dissolution after ath treatment were most significant by 63 6 4 12 g l vs 6 74 g l and 197 7 0 63 g l vs 1 88 g l as the temperature of ath further increased to 160 c the improvement in spn and sha production was as high as 49 8 and 187 8 while with ath at 180 c they became less significant to only 18 7 and 130 9 respectively the enhanced spn production by ath treatment could be attributed to the increased solubilization of hydrophobic molecules under alkaline conditions as well as the decreased hydrogen bonding under high ionic strength created by large amounts of ca2 tan et al 2012 xiao et al 2017 further the particulate proteins released could be hydrolyzed into small soluble fractions however for single th treatment heat can intensify the interactions between amino acids radicals via electrostatic binding hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions which hinder the degradation of high mw proteins silva et al 2017 therefore the proportion of small mw fraction in ath liquor was maintained higher than that in th liquor fig s1 in terms of the enhanced sha production the accumulation of sha in sludge liquor after ath treatments upon and over 120 c exceeded the total ha detected in eps of rs fig 3a according to our previous researches tang et al 2020 tang et al 2018 the protein binding structures of eps have the masked effects on the detection of supramolecular ha in rs and the enhanced protein hydrolysis by ath discussed above would allow more ha release from eps additionally the high ionic strength also can unfold polymerized ha molecules to expose their chromogenic groups while in the situation with a temperature higher than 160 c one more reason for the solubilization rate over 100 may be the formation of new ha from maillard reaction rodríguez abalde et al 2011 it should be noticed that free amino acids faas are also n pgpn which can be produced through protein hydrolysis in sewage sludge importantly they could be directly used by plants or serve as the precursors for n pgpb production the results illustrated in fig 3b suggested the faas were major nutrients in ath liquor but also th liquor after treatments at 100 180 c specifically the maximal faas generated from ath treatment at 120 c was 56 82 g l which was as high as the result reported by lu et al 2021 who conducted a single th of waste activated sludge with a high vs ts of 80 however for sewage sludge with low vs ts used in the present study the greatest accumulation of faas achieved from ath at 120 c was 74 9 greater than that from th treatment at 160 c confirming the superior effect of ath on the protein hydrolysis again moreover for individual amino acids the most enriched ones by ath at 120 c were acidic compounds aspartic asp and glutamic acids glu as well as hydrophobic components glycine gly alanine ala leucine leu and phenylalanine phe corresponding to reduced hydrogen bonding and enhanced hydrophobic proteins dissolution due to the addition of ca oh 2 further the drastic release of amino acids in ath at low temperature could compensate for whose loss by ammonolysis at 140 180 c wang et al 2018 wilson and novak 2009 so that the higher organic n could be maintained in ath liquor rather than th liquor additionally the continuous decrease of faas in ath treated sludge from 120 to 160 c may be explained by whose conversion into relevant amino acids originated n pgpb which would be discussed in the following section 3 4 the production of n pgpb in sludge liquor by ath treatment the n pgpb investigated in this study included phytohormones and allelochemicals both are functional at exerting considerable fertilizer effects in small contents among well recognized phytohormones only two auxins i e indole 3 acetic acid iaa and hydroxyphenyl acetic acids hpas were detected in the sludge liquor fig 4 a for iaa its concentration in rs was below the detection limit however iaa concentration in sludge liquor increased significantly after ath treatment with the increase of temperature from 100 to 160 c and reached the highest by 0 198 mg l at 160 c when the temperature of ath was 180 c the concertation decreased to 0 166 mg l in contrast with th treatment only iaa was only detected in low temperature conditions showing the highest concentration 0 332 mg l at 100 c as for another active auxin family less than 0 001 mg l hpas were detected in rs after single th treatment the maximal release of hpas occurring at 100 c was 0 452 mg l while the production of hpas by ath increased with the increase of temperature from 100 to 160 c and achieved the greatest by 0 958 mg l which was 47 4 higher than that achieved by th treatment functionally as previously reported the vacuolar h atpase and h pyrophosphatase which are the critical enzymes regulating the growth and tolerance of plant cells were sensitive to a broad range of auxins concentrations from 10 3 to 10 15 m band et al 2012 zandonadi et al 2007 the iaa and hpas produced from ath160 reached 0 198 and 0 958 mg l respectively so that the total auxins in ath160 liquor were as high as 5 65 10 3 m hence even the ath160 liquor was diluted with 100 fold to adjust ph within 8 9 5 before application the contents of auxins still can be regarded as efficient besides phytohormones more and more allelochemicals that show hormone like effects on plant growth have been included in the sector of pgpb in recent years especially molecules that derived from aromatic amino acids aaas i e trp phe and tyr such as indolic derivatives idds and aromatic carboxylic acids acas li et al 2018 omotayo and babalola 2020 scaglia et al 2015 2017 they are n containing substances and they were also detected in this study fig 4a results showed that both idds and acas generated from ath treatment increased as the temperature increased from 100 c to 160 c resulting in a sum of 4 95 mg l at 160 c however there was an opposite trend in single th treatment and the highest production 0 82 mg l was achieved at 100 c which was only 16 6 of the maximum production achieved by ath 160 it should be noted that the accumulation of n pgpb in the alkaline condition can be enhanced as temperature increased below 180 c while for single th treatment they turned to decline when the temperature heated over 120 c this indicated the existence of n pgpb under alkaline condition were relatively more stable the phenomenon can be attributed to the presence of ca2 which can form bridges between carboxylic groups of n pgpb thus increasing their stability flemming and wingender 2010 moreover more has were released into the liquor by ath treatment fig 3a more n pgpb could be absorbed by released has and thereby becoming more persistent he et al 2016 nebbioso and piccolo 2013 from this point of view the usage of ca oh 2 helped to enrich more n pgpb in the liquor by preventing them from mineralization interestingly as the unique substrate of n pgpb detected in this study aaas were largest accumulated after ath at 120 c fig 3b while the highest n pgpb were achieved until ath heating to 160 c fig 4a to further understand the process of aaas conversion into n pgpb during ath the aaas derived compounds for n pgpb production i e amides and amines precursors of n pgpb were analyzed based on gc ms data fig 4b the amides and amines of phenylacetamide phenylethylamine and tyramine were detected as the precursors of hpas and acas classified into n pgpba derived from phe and tyr while the amides and amines of indole acetamide and tryptamine were detected as the trp originated precursors of iaas and idds classified into n pgpbb in comparison two kinds of intermediates developed quickly in ath and reached the highest at 140 c showing 7 99 and 2 30 times of the optimal levels in th thus when compared to th it can be inferred ath was more efficient at releasing amino substrates and transferring them into relevant intermediates below 140 c thus resulting in a superior yield of n pgpb at 160 c 3 5 the mechanisms for the enhanced n pgpn and n pgpb production by ath treatment to figure out the component transformation mechanisms determining n pgpn and n pgpb production during th and ath treatments the 2d correlation ftir spectra were used to track the sequence of functional groups in samples analyzed in order fig 5 the band assignments for ftir spectral features were summarized in table s1 combining analysis of asynchronous and synchronous maps showed that during ath treatment the susceptibility of peaks in liquor samples with increasing temperature was 1340 1427 1567 1490 1030 1071 1142 cm 1 this indicated the sequence of functional groups in ath liquor from 100 c to 180 c were 1 coh and co associated with amino acids 2 conh of amide ii coo stretches associated with amino acids and carboxylic acid 3 co and coh stretch derived from polysaccharides moreover the synchronous map of ath liquor showed negative correlations between peaks of 1567 1490 1427 cm 1 and 1030 1070 1142 cm 1 clearly during ath treatment the protein hydrolysis with amino acids production could be achieved at low temperatures as the temperature increased the amino acids and amide ii downshifted while the solubilization of polysaccharides turned to be significant as for th liquor the changes of peaks in samples with the temperature increase followed the order 1406 1580 1040 1193 1458 1621 1714 cm 1 1040 1367 cm 1 and 1040 1280 cm 1 results implied the sequence of functional groups feature as 1 carboxyl groups associated with amino acids conh of amide i 2 co and coh from polysaccharides 3 co and coh from polysaccharides conh of amine ii nh2 of amide i ketones and carboxyl groups additionally there were two more kinds of groups of amino acids 1367 cm 1 and amide iii 1280 cm 1 being active after that of polysaccharides 1040 cm 1 thus this order suggested that in th treatment most amino acids and amides were produced after the release of polysaccharides it is worth noting that in the organic waste treatment the polysaccharides solubilization and denaturation usually occur under 140 165 c barber 2016 carrere et al 2010 xiao and zhou 2020 hence the protein hydrolysis with amino acids and amides production required high temperatures in single th moreover as the temperature further increased with the positive correlation in the synchronous map of th liquor one more feature of polysaccharides 1193 cm 1 might be consumed along with amino acids and amides 1458 1621 1714 cm 1 this can be caused by maillard reaction ioannou et al 2017 which is an array of non enzymatic consecutive and parallel chemical reactions between reduced sugar and amino acids generally the maillard reaction could be divided into three stages i the condensation of the reducing sugar with the amino groups via formation of schiff s base and the amadori rearrangement to the so called amadori product ii the breakdown of the amadori product into numerous fission products of the sugar amino compound iii the condensation of amino compounds and sugar fragments into polymerized protein and brown pigments called melanoidins kumar and naresh 2017 further corresponding to the characteristics of maillard reaction with the early or simultaneous polysaccharides downshift the occurrence of 1367 cm 1 may be attributed to the in schiff s base the product from the first step of the critical amino carbonyl reaction additionally the feature of 1621 cm 1 can be regarded as the amino backbone left in the final products of maillard reaction ioannou et al 2017 however in ath treatment the polysaccharides downshift appeared at the last and there was no characteristic peak of maillard reaction products observed in ath spectra suggesting ath could reduce the maillard reaction information provided from 2d correlation ftir maps was consistent with the results of n pgpb intermediates changes as the temperature increased in the range of 100 140 c the protein hydrolysis with the production of free amino acids and n pgpb s precursors were much greater in ath liquor than that in th liquor figs 3b and 4b on the contrary for single th the development of protein hydrolysis requires a high temperature over 140 c in which case the amino materials are easily condensed with denatured polysaccharides through maillard reaction results of this study highlight the important protein hydrolysis and amino conversion towards specific n pgpb s precursors should be achieved before the release of polysaccharides for producing high n pgpn and n pgpb but also for avoiding maillard reaction this order should be considered in developing thermal related technologies to recover n pgpn and n pgpb from waste organics 3 6 field study the characteristics of sludge liquor generated after ath treatment at 120 c in a field study using sewage sludge from a wwtp in rugao are listed in table s2 the effects of ath in pilot scale on n solubilization 63 59 of tsn tn seed germination stimulation 105 9 of gi as well as metals reduction were consistent with that achieved on the lab scale table 3 compares the performance of crop quantity and crop growth after applying sludge liquor fertilizer and urea fertilizer respectively the results showed that the average fresh pod yield of soybean reached 9000 kg hm2 after using sludge liquor which was 20 higher than that obtained in the urea group also the fresh weight per 100 soybeans in the sludge liquor group 155 g was 12 3 higher than that in the urea group 138 g moreover the application of sludge liquor effectively reduced the single pod rate to 7 8 which is about half of that in the urea group in terms of crop growth the seed germination index gi after using sludge liquor was 6 4 higher than that using urea fertilizer more distinctively in the sludge liquor group the average root hairs significantly became thicker fig s2 the number of root hairs per plant exceed 50 after applying sludge liquor whereas it was only 10 20 in the urea group besides the similar ph of the test field soil before 7 56 and after 7 49 soybean planting suggested there was no phenomenon of salinization by applying sludge liquor thus compared with the urea fertilizer the sludge liquor generated after ath at 120 c already significantly improved soybean yields under the field condition it could be expected that the promotion of plant growth and yield with sludge liquor produced after ath treatment at 140 160 c may be more promising as higher n pgpn and n pgpb could be produced as suggested by the lab scale investigation however the field study is worthy to be conducted in future to further verify the fertilizing effect of sludge liquor produced after ath treatment at 140 160 c 3 7 perspective of the application of liquid fertilizer produced from sewage sludge with ath treatment this study demonstrated that the ath treatment of sewage sludge could produce sludge liquor which is rich in n pgpn and n pgpb it further proved that the sludge liquor produced by ath could be used as the liquid fertilizer facilitating plant growth without inducing heavy metal contamination and soil salinization these results suggested ath treatment can be a promising technology to recovery n containing resources from sewage sludge for agriculture application the technology is especially suitable for the sewage sludge with a low vs ts ratio as it can achieve dual goals of sludge treatment for such sludge i e sludge reduction and resource recovery while the traditional biotreatment such as anaerobic digestion is not applicable cieślik et al 2015 yang et al 2015 to achieve high n pgpn and n pgpb production in the liquid fertilizer with significant gi increase the optimal temperature of ath should be set at 140 160 c as indicated by lab scale experiments however the field study revealed that ath at 120 c could already achieve significant improvement on crop yields compared to conventional urea fertilizer moreover the calcium alkali is more recommended in the ath process than the sodium and potassium alkali for n pgpn and n pgpb recovery one reason is that the presence of ca2 can more efficiently reduce hydrogen bonds and induce a high ionic strength as compared to na and k and thus it is believed to facilitate the solubilization of larger high mw and or hydrophobic proteins silva et al 2017 in addition as one of polyvalent metals the ca2 ions might act as coagulants to bind carboxyl in amino acids to enhance the stability of dissolved organic matrix chen et al 2016 xu et al 2017 this effect of ca2 may also support the greater retention of son and more stable existence of n pgpb in ath liquor than in th liquor thus for practical application the ath conditions for liquid fertilizer production should be optimized after comprehensively considering multiple factors such as crop yields energy consumption and operational ease and so on in addition researches have been suggested that the n pgpn and n pgpb may not only promote plant growth but also could active soil microorganisms and chelate hazard materials which would be beneficial to enhance the arability of the land in long term operation cao et al 2016 jones et al 2005 thus the effect of n pgpn and n pgpb in liquid fertilizer produced from sewage sludge by ath treatment on soil microorganisms and soil properties are worthy to be investigated in the future 4 conclusion this study investigated the feasibility of using alkaline thermal hydrolysis ath to produce liquid fertilizer with nitrogen containing plant growth promoting nutrients n pgpn and biostimulants n pgpb and the main conclusion could be drawn as follow 1 the ath treatment promoted the sludge reduction with enhanced organic nitrogen release and maintenance in sludge liquor due to the presence of ca oh 2 which would benefit n pgpn and n pgpb production and accumulation in sludge liquor 2 the major n pgpn produced in sludge liquor after ath treatment were free amino acids which are followed by soluble protein and soluble humic substances their productions were most significantly increased when the temperature increased to 120 140 c 3 the n pgpb produced in sludge liquor were mainly indole 3 acetic acid and hydroxyphenyl acetic acids known as phytohormones and indolic derives and aromatic carboxylic acids known as allelochemicals the highest n pgpb production by ath treatment was achieved at 160 c 4 substantial release of protein derives and their conversion towards n pgpb intermediates before the solubilization and denaturation of polysaccharides with temperature increased thus avoiding maillard reaction is a key reason for achieving high n pgpn and n pgpb production by ath treatment 5 the usage of ath liquor improved the plant growth without inducing heavy metal contamination and soil salinization suggesting ath is a promising technology for producing high quality liquid fertilizer from sewage sludge this method is

16307,to produce liquid fertilizer containing nitrogen containing plant growth promoting nutrients n pgpn and plant growth promoting biostimulants n pgpb from sewage sludge is attracting increasing interest recently due to its superb fertilizing effect and the ease of application thus this study aims to investigate the feasibility of producing high quality liquid fertilizer with n pgpn and n pgpb recovery through alkaline thermal hydrolysis ath using ca oh 2 results suggested that ath treatment was superior in n solubilization tsn tn 54 and organic n maintenance in sludge liquor 80 when compared to single thermal hydrolysis th more surprisingly ath also promoted the production of n pgpn and n pgpb as for n pgpn the maximum free amino acids faas accumulation in ath liquor was 56 82 g l at 120 c while soluble protein spn and soluble humic acid sha reached 8 30 8 88 g l and 1 88 2 05 g l at 140 160 c the greatest n pgpb produced by ath treatment was achieved at 160 c with the detection of 1 156 mg l phytohormones indole 3 acetic acid and hydroxyphenyl acetic acids and 4 95 mg l allelochemicals indolic derivatives and aromatic carboxylic acids the 2d correlation ftir maps analyses suggested compared with th ath could achieve protein hydrolysis before polysaccharides solubilization and denaturation with the temperature increased thus avoiding maillard reaction and benefiting n pgpb production moreover the laboratory investigation and field study indicated the usage of ath liquor improved the growth of plants without inducing heavy metal contamination and soil salinization hence ath is a promising technology to produce high quality liquid fertilizer rich with n pgpn and n pgpb from sewage sludge especially suitable for such sludge with a low vs ts ratio

total nitrogen content ts total solids content tsn total soluble nitrogen vs volatile solids content 1 introduction the application of sewage sludge for agriculture propose has been recommended by water industries for decades as the sludge contains a high fraction of nutrients such as nitrogen n it has been estimated that the use of sewage sludge can be a promising alternative to 30 n containing chemical fertilizer when fully applied raheem et al 2018 recently for resource recovery and agricultural development an increasing number of researches have focused on the production of n containing plant growth promoting nutrients n pgpn from the sewage sludge he et al 2015 soobhany 2019 tang et al 2021 these compounds were usually existed in the forms of humic substances proteins and protein hydrolysis products such as peptides amino acids ammonia etc and they are believed to be the key components for facilitating plant growth tejada et al 2013 moreover in the organic waste treatment amino acids have been found to be the important substrate to produce n containing plant growth promoting biostimulants n pgpb i e the phytohormones and allelochemicals that show well leveraged effects on regulating the nutrient uptake by plants and their tolerance to abiotic stress qi et al 2018 scaglia et al 2015 2017 thus the amino acids in sewage sludge can also be expected to be transferred to valuable n pgpb products in the practice of agriculture application the direct application of sewage sludge is limited by the existence of putrescible organic matter pathogenic organisms and heavy metals kelessidis and stasinakis 2012 yang et al 2015 therefore in recent years increasing attention has been paid to the liquid fertilizer produced from sludge by collecting sludge dewatering liquor hereinafter referred to as sludge liquor and the application of sludge liquor to the farmland was easier than sludge itself thermal hydrolysis th treatment has been investigated for producing liquid fertilizer from sewage sludge tampio et al 2016 as it could improve sludge dewaterability and the temperature condition above 120 c could sterilize pathogens barber 2016 moreover th treatment could facilitate the solubilization of sludge particulates as well as the release of n containing compounds due to its effects on the depolymerization and cleavage of chemical bonds zhang et al 2020 a recent study has also demonstrated that the phytohormone of indole 3 acetic acid could be produced from waste activated sludge by th lu et al 2021 however th may have negative effects such as the uncontrolled release of heavy metals lu et al 2021 xue et al 2015 and the easily occurred maillard reaction which hindered the usage of released nutrients by forming melanoidins rodríguez abalde et al 2011 the recently developed alkaline thermal hydrolysis ath treatment may be superior to th for producing higher quality liquid fertilizer from the sludge during ath treatment the ph of sludge samples would be increased and the bacterial surface become increasingly negatively charged as a result more extracellular polymeric substances eps can be desorbed from sludge flocs due to high electrostatic repulsion katsiris and kouzeli katsiri 1987 moreover at extremely high ph values 11 the cell lysis may occur as it cannot maintain an appropriate turgor pressure kim et al 2010 tan et al 2012 both the enhanced destroy of eps and possible cell lysis may generate more n pgpn as well as precursors of n pgpb for producing high liquid fertilizer however the potential and regulation mechanisms of ath treatment on the recovery of n pgpn and n pgpb from sewage sludge have not yet been studied additionally previous researches mainly focused on the transformation of inorganic n during sludge treatment however compared to n pgpn and n pgpb mainly in the form of organic n the inorganic n is easy to lose due to the irrigation after application yuan et al 2018 thus how to maximize the generation of n pgpn and n pgpb and reduce the formation of inorganic n during liquid fertilizer production also remains a research gap therefore the aims of this study are to investigate the feasibility of using ath treatment to produce the high quality liquid fertilizer containing n pgpn and n pgpb the effect of ath treatment on n pgpn and n pgpb production from sewage sludge and the mechanisms involved were explored on this basis the regulation strategies for maximizing their production were proposed the ca oh 2 was used as the alkaline compound for ath treatment in this study although it was less effective than naoh in protein solubilization li et al 2008 the usage of ca oh 2 has many other advantages such as low cost ease of storage and sludge dewaterability after treatment li et al 2014 the n pgpn and n pgpb recovery from the sludge by th treatment was also tested as a comparison in addition a field study of crop planting using liquor fertilizer produced from ath treatment was conducted for validating its effectiveness 2 materials and methods 2 1 sewage sludge and experimental design for sludge treatments the raw sludge rs was collected from a municipal sewage treatment plant in changsha china which is the thickened sludge containing 90 of secondary sludge and 10 of primary sludge the rs had a high total solids ts content by 201 2 0 4 g kg but a low ratio of volatile solids to ts vs ts 326 9 2 7 g kg which is a typical characteristic of sludge produced from wwtps in the south of china cieślik et al 2015 qu et al 2019 yang et al 2015 the experiment was designed to obtain the liquid products from alkaline thermal hydrolysis ath and thermal hydrolysis treatment th of sewage sludge and the temperature of thermal treatments was designed from 100 to 180 c in brief the experimental unit for thermal treatment was a 300 ml hydrolysis reactor consisting of an inner polytetrafluoroethylene container and a vessel made of stainless steel 150 g homogenized sewage sludge was put in each inner container and the reactors were then sealed carefully and heated in an electronic oven for ath the 150 g sludge was mixed with ca oh 2 around 0 2 g g ts to adjust ph to 12 5 0 5 before thermal treatments the thermal reactions in the hydrolysis reactor were progressed in autogenously saturated pressure corresponding to different temperatures and the start point was recorded when the oven reached the preset temperature 100 c 120 c 140 c 160 c and 180 c after the duration of 4 h reactions were stopped and the reactors were cooled down in ice water taking 60 90 min afterward the reactors were opened and the slurry was centrifuged at 8000 r min for 20 mins the sludge liquor was collected and used for soluble components analyses and the extraction method of extracellular polymeric substances from the precipitate was described by xu et al 2018 2 2 characterizations of the solid and liquid fraction of sludge samples after treatments sludge solubilization was described in terms of chemical oxygen demand cod solubilization and volatile solids vs reduction cod solubilization was defined as the ratio between the increase of insoluble cod due to ath or th treatments and the initial particulate cod which was shown in eq 1 the vs reduction rate was determined as the difference between the vs content in rs and that in the solid fraction obtained after centrifugation which was shown in eq 2 1 cod solu bili zati on 100 cods cod s r cod t r cod s r where total cod of rs and the cod value in the soluble phase are called codtr and cods respectively while the cods determined in rs is codsr 2 vs reduction 100 v s r m r v s p m p where the vsr vsp mr and mp are the volatile solids content and the mass of rs and the precipitate from the treated slurry respectively the liquid products obtained after ath and th were filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane the fertilizer properties of the liquor were tested in terms of n recovery and seed germination index gi the contents of total soluble nitrogen tsn nh4 n no3 n were measured according to the standard methods apha 2005 total soluble organic nitrogen son concentrations were calculated by the difference of tsn and total inorganic nitrogen species nh4 n and no3 n he et al 2015 the gi was used to evaluate the biostimulant effects of the liquid products on seed germination and the early development of plants to adjust the ph value in sludge liquor within the range of 9 5 10 0 all the samples were diluted 120 times before gi testes details of gi assays have been reported in tang et al 2018 the gi was calculated as eq 3 3 gi 100 g r a s l g r b a s l b where gr is the seed germination rate in sludge liquors grb is the seed germination rate in the blank sample i e deionized water asl is the average shoot length in sludge liquors and aslb is the average shoot length in the blank sample i e deionized water the liquid samples were characterized in terms of weight average molecular weight mw distribution and fourier transform infrared ftir spectra the mw was determined using a high performance liquid chromatograph 1260 infinity agilent santa clara ca usa equipped with a pl aquagel oh mixed m column 8 μm 300 7 5 mm agilent and a refractive index detector for ftir a mixture of 1 2 mg of freeze dried eps and 100 mg of potassium bromide kbr ir grade was ground and pressed to obtain pellets after using a spectrometer nicolet 5700 nicolet waltham ma usa to scan from 400 to 4000 cm 1 the sum of the ftir absorbance was normalized and multiplied by 1000 2d correlation spectroscopy was conducted by 2dshige software kwansei gakuin university japan 2 3 quantitative determination of n pgpn and n pgpb 2 3 1 determination of n pgpn the concentration of n pgpn i e soluble protein spn and soluble humic acids sha of liquid samples were analyzed using an enzyme labeled instrument elx800 biotek us following the modified lowry method frolund et al 1995 for the quantification of pn and ha in eps the extracted eps was solubilized in deionized water and adjusted to ph 8 0 for free amino acids faas the extraction and detection procedures were according to chen et al 2019 the final faas determination used ultra performance liquid chromatography waters acquity uplc hclass usa 2 3 2 lc ms ms detection of n pgpb phytohormones the phytohormone determination in previous studies was widely based on the data from lc detection however the lc coupled with mass spectrometry such as lc ms or lc ms ms should be applied to ensure the quantification to be well targeted according to reports about the identification and quantification of phytohormones in algae and plants using lc ms ms prinsen et al 1998 yalçın et al 2019 the extraction and detection procedures of phytohormones in sludge liquor were adjusted to the recovery rate in the range of 90 110 in brief 2 000 g of each sample was mixed with 0 40 g edta 2na and acetonitrile phosphate buffer solution with ph 3 0 before oscillating vortex at room temperature for 2 min ultrasonic centrifugation and rotary evaporation the remaining liquid was rotated and purified by sax hlb series solid phase extraction column from each sample 2 μl of the supernatant was injected into the lc system for the condition for ms detection the cone and desolvation gas flow source temperature and de solvation temperature and cone voltage for the electrospray ionization were set as 800 l h 1 150 and 450 c 30 00 v respectively more details for instrument parameters can be checked in the supplementary information 2 3 3 gc ms detection allelochemicals classified in n pgpb and intermediates for n pgpb the extraction and detection were according to previous reports for dissolved organic samples scaglia et al 2016 scaglia et al 2015 2017 and details can be checked in the supplementary information for initial gc ms data analysis which was processed using chromatof v 4 34 leco st joseph mi including the integration normalization and alignment of the peak intensities the selected spectra were then elaborated to subtract the internal standard sample peaks and to semi quantitatively calculate the molecule concentrations by direct comparison with the internal standard peak area 2 4 field study of the production and land application of sludge ath liquor the sewage sludge from a municipal wwtp in rugao china ssrg was used for liquid fertilizer production and planting test under field conditions ssrg also showed a high total solids ts content by 189 7 1 3 g kg but a low ratio of volatile solids to ts vs ts 301 7 5 3 which were similar to characteristics of rs used in lab scale the 150 kg ssrg was mixed with 0 15 0 20 g g ts lime and treated in an ath system yuezichun nantong china the set temperature of the ath system was 120 c which is the highest for safe operation due to the limitation of the device the actual temperature in the system may fluctuate in the range of 120 140 c the liquor products were collected after dewatering the treated sludge using a plate and frame type filter press jingjin china the effects of ath treatment on the recovery of n the production of n pgpn and n pgpb as well as metal reduction shown in liquor liquorrg were tested the obtained liquid fertilizer was then used for field planting test with 133 500 plants of soybean glycine max l merr per hm2 the liquorrg was diluted 100 times and applied on roots twice in aug 2019 and on the leaf surface once in sep 2019 crop quantity and crop quality in the experimental group nourished using liquorrg were compared to those using commercialized urea sinochem group china with equal n supply data of crop growth in field study were provided by nantong yuezichun biological agriculture technology co ltd 2 5 other analyses the measurements of ts vs ph electrical conductivity cod and the digestion of rs sample and liquid products before metals determination were according to standard methods apha 2005 the determination of polyvalent metals and harmful metals for fertilizer were analyzed using icp oes aglient 5110 all samples used for analyses were performed in triplicates measurement data were all shown as mean standard deviation all the analyses were performed with ibm spss statistics 23 for windows ibm corp ny usa a p value 0 05 was considered statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 sludge reduction and cod solubilization after ath treatment the vs reduction and cod solubilization were investigated to evaluate the overall potential of nutrient release from sewage sludge after ath treatments the vs reduction ratio after ath and th treatment were compared in fig 1 a the results showed that after ath at 100 140 c the vs reduction reached 15 7 35 9 which were more than twice higher than that after th at the same temperature in the temperature range of 160 180 c the values of vs reduction were stable by 37 6 38 0 after ath likely due to that the sludge solubilization already finished at the low temperatures but still the reduction ratios were about 1 4 1 5 times higher than those after th notably the sewage sludge with a low vs ts below 35 which is considered unsuitable for the biotreatment process cieślik et al 2015 yang et al 2015 in which case the ath can be regarded as a promising method for separating organic resources from the sludge as for cod solubilization fig 1b the value obtained after ath at 100 c was slightly lower than that from th this can be attributed to the negative effect of ca2 which could re flocculate dissolved organic polymers li et al 2008 however when the temperature increased from 120 c to 160 c the cod solubilization after ath was 127 3 147 3 of that from th while when the temperature further increased to 180 c the intergroup difference of cod solubilization decreased this suggested that the effects of ca oh 2 on promoting nutrient release were mainly significant at a medium temperature range of 120 160 c 3 2 physiochemical characteristics and fertilizing effect of sludge liquor produced after ath treatment n species and concentrations are important chemical parameters of fertilizers which in the sludge liquor generated after ath and th treatments hereinafter referred to as ath liquor and th liquor were tested and compared in fig 2 overall the ath treatment was superior to th treatment in releasing n from the sewage sludge and maintaining organic n in the liquor products specifically n solubilization was limited by the single th treatment the maximal total soluble n tsn in th liquor was 1 710 g l at 180 c and the ratio of which to total n tn in rs tsn tn was only 24 25 this result can be regarded as normal effects of th on n recovery reported in the literature lu et al 2021 wang et al 2018 wilson and novak 2009 the ath treatment on the other hand significantly enhanced n solubilization the tsn in ath liquor increased to 3 472 3 976 g l at 140 180 c and the tsn tn enlarged to more than 54 the tsn content achieved by ath at 180 c was 2 32 times that achieved by th at the same temperature in terms of soluble organic n son which occupied a stable proportion in tsn son tsn by 81 94 80 19 after ath at 100 180 c while that from th gradually decreased from 89 90 to 70 54 after treatments at 100 180 c it has been reported that son could be accelerated to convert into ammonia under high temperatures with the cleavage in amines and the destruction of the peptide bonds wang et al 2018 wilson and novak 2009 possible explanations for the greater retention of son in ath treatment were that the organic n solubilization under the ath conditions could catch up with the son mineralization and or the deamination may reduce due to the presence of ca2 which is functional for forming bridges between amino acids flemming and wingender 2010 therefore the enhanced organic n release and maintenance were beneficial for higher n pgpn and n pgpb production and accumulation in ath liquor the ph and electrical conductivity ec in ath and th liquor were listed in table 1 the ph values were stable as 12 51 12 68 ath and 7 12 7 05 th after treatments at 100 120 c while clear ph reductions occurred when the temperature was heating upon and over 140 c the ph reduction suggested the enhanced depolymerization and cleavage degree of chemical bonds in sludge organics resulting in the release of amino acids and fatty acids zhang et al 2020 as for the application of liquid fertilizer the recommended ph condition is weakly alkaline ph of 8 9 5 tampio et al 2016 so the sludge liquor may require a more than 100 fold dilution before land application electrical conductivity is a useful parameter to track the change of soluble salts resulting from organic degradation and immobilization bustamante et al 2012 the electrical conductivity values in liquor of ath were more than three times of that th at 100 140 c further indicating the advantage of ath on sludge hydrolysis at low temperatures however a decreasing trend of electrical conductivity can be found in ath at 140 180 c this was likely due to the increasing insoluble salts formed by hydrophobic materials and metals which were easy to be separated after centrifugation correspondingly as seen in table 2 compared with th ath at 140 180 c was functional to reduce the release of polyvalent metals mg al zn ni fe mn cu and harmful metals cr as cd pb hg and whose concentrations were far less than the content limits in many regulations such as german fertilizer ordinance 2015 and chinese agriculture standard 2010 the germination index gi was used to assess the fertilizing effect of the sludge liquor which was also listed in table 1 as a high electrical conductivity value may pose an inhibitory effect on seed germination tang et al 2018 and the level of 1 50 ms cm 1 is considered as the threshold for the healthy growth of bio media nurdiawati et al 2018 all liquid samples were diluted to having the same salinity around 0 50 ms cm 1 before gi tests the results showed that ath at 120 180 c can produce liquor products with a higher seed germination index gi 103 119 than that from the control sample 100 suggesting positive effects on seedling and early plant growth specifically the highest gi was observed at ath 160 by 119 which was almost twice that of raw sludge 61 on the contrary gi levels in samples from th were all below 100 and decreased as the temperature rose indicating the increase of phytotoxic factors such as salinity tracked by the increase of electrical conductivity rather than the fertilizing effect with the increase of temperature 3 3 the production of n pgpn in sludge liquor by ath treatment soluble proteins spn and soluble humic acids sha were two main n pgpn in sludge liquor products with spn concentrations about 1 9 9 2 times higher than sha as shown in fig 3 a spn and sha were very limited in rs by 0 62 and 0 02 g l respectively after th treatment at 100 180 c the spn and sha concentrations increased to 3 50 7 81 g l and 0 34 0 93 g l respectively which correspondingly accounted for 12 3 27 5 and 27 7 75 2 of pn and ha in the eps of rs compared with th treatment the ath treatment presented the higher effectiveness in n pgpn solubilization at the temperature range of 120 180 c and the spn and sha concentration could correspondingly reach 6 74 9 27 g l and 1 34 2 15 g l especially at low temperatures when compared to th treatment the enhancement of spn 120 c and sha 140 c dissolution after ath treatment were most significant by 63 6 4 12 g l vs 6 74 g l and 197 7 0 63 g l vs 1 88 g l as the temperature of ath further increased to 160 c the improvement in spn and sha production was as high as 49 8 and 187 8 while with ath at 180 c they became less significant to only 18 7 and 130 9 respectively the enhanced spn production by ath treatment could be attributed to the increased solubilization of hydrophobic molecules under alkaline conditions as well as the decreased hydrogen bonding under high ionic strength created by large amounts of ca2 tan et al 2012 xiao et al 2017 further the particulate proteins released could be hydrolyzed into small soluble fractions however for single th treatment heat can intensify the interactions between amino acids radicals via electrostatic binding hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions which hinder the degradation of high mw proteins silva et al 2017 therefore the proportion of small mw fraction in ath liquor was maintained higher than that in th liquor fig s1 in terms of the enhanced sha production the accumulation of sha in sludge liquor after ath treatments upon and over 120 c exceeded the total ha detected in eps of rs fig 3a according to our previous researches tang et al 2020 tang et al 2018 the protein binding structures of eps have the masked effects on the detection of supramolecular ha in rs and the enhanced protein hydrolysis by ath discussed above would allow more ha release from eps additionally the high ionic strength also can unfold polymerized ha molecules to expose their chromogenic groups while in the situation with a temperature higher than 160 c one more reason for the solubilization rate over 100 may be the formation of new ha from maillard reaction rodríguez abalde et al 2011 it should be noticed that free amino acids faas are also n pgpn which can be produced through protein hydrolysis in sewage sludge importantly they could be directly used by plants or serve as the precursors for n pgpb production the results illustrated in fig 3b suggested the faas were major nutrients in ath liquor but also th liquor after treatments at 100 180 c specifically the maximal faas generated from ath treatment at 120 c was 56 82 g l which was as high as the result reported by lu et al 2021 who conducted a single th of waste activated sludge with a high vs ts of 80 however for sewage sludge with low vs ts used in the present study the greatest accumulation of faas achieved from ath at 120 c was 74 9 greater than that from th treatment at 160 c confirming the superior effect of ath on the protein hydrolysis again moreover for individual amino acids the most enriched ones by ath at 120 c were acidic compounds aspartic asp and glutamic acids glu as well as hydrophobic components glycine gly alanine ala leucine leu and phenylalanine phe corresponding to reduced hydrogen bonding and enhanced hydrophobic proteins dissolution due to the addition of ca oh 2 further the drastic release of amino acids in ath at low temperature could compensate for whose loss by ammonolysis at 140 180 c wang et al 2018 wilson and novak 2009 so that the higher organic n could be maintained in ath liquor rather than th liquor additionally the continuous decrease of faas in ath treated sludge from 120 to 160 c may be explained by whose conversion into relevant amino acids originated n pgpb which would be discussed in the following section 3 4 the production of n pgpb in sludge liquor by ath treatment the n pgpb investigated in this study included phytohormones and allelochemicals both are functional at exerting considerable fertilizer effects in small contents among well recognized phytohormones only two auxins i e indole 3 acetic acid iaa and hydroxyphenyl acetic acids hpas were detected in the sludge liquor fig 4 a for iaa its concentration in rs was below the detection limit however iaa concentration in sludge liquor increased significantly after ath treatment with the increase of temperature from 100 to 160 c and reached the highest by 0 198 mg l at 160 c when the temperature of ath was 180 c the concertation decreased to 0 166 mg l in contrast with th treatment only iaa was only detected in low temperature conditions showing the highest concentration 0 332 mg l at 100 c as for another active auxin family less than 0 001 mg l hpas were detected in rs after single th treatment the maximal release of hpas occurring at 100 c was 0 452 mg l while the production of hpas by ath increased with the increase of temperature from 100 to 160 c and achieved the greatest by 0 958 mg l which was 47 4 higher than that achieved by th treatment functionally as previously reported the vacuolar h atpase and h pyrophosphatase which are the critical enzymes regulating the growth and tolerance of plant cells were sensitive to a broad range of auxins concentrations from 10 3 to 10 15 m band et al 2012 zandonadi et al 2007 the iaa and hpas produced from ath160 reached 0 198 and 0 958 mg l respectively so that the total auxins in ath160 liquor were as high as 5 65 10 3 m hence even the ath160 liquor was diluted with 100 fold to adjust ph within 8 9 5 before application the contents of auxins still can be regarded as efficient besides phytohormones more and more allelochemicals that show hormone like effects on plant growth have been included in the sector of pgpb in recent years especially molecules that derived from aromatic amino acids aaas i e trp phe and tyr such as indolic derivatives idds and aromatic carboxylic acids acas li et al 2018 omotayo and babalola 2020 scaglia et al 2015 2017 they are n containing substances and they were also detected in this study fig 4a results showed that both idds and acas generated from ath treatment increased as the temperature increased from 100 c to 160 c resulting in a sum of 4 95 mg l at 160 c however there was an opposite trend in single th treatment and the highest production 0 82 mg l was achieved at 100 c which was only 16 6 of the maximum production achieved by ath 160 it should be noted that the accumulation of n pgpb in the alkaline condition can be enhanced as temperature increased below 180 c while for single th treatment they turned to decline when the temperature heated over 120 c this indicated the existence of n pgpb under alkaline condition were relatively more stable the phenomenon can be attributed to the presence of ca2 which can form bridges between carboxylic groups of n pgpb thus increasing their stability flemming and wingender 2010 moreover more has were released into the liquor by ath treatment fig 3a more n pgpb could be absorbed by released has and thereby becoming more persistent he et al 2016 nebbioso and piccolo 2013 from this point of view the usage of ca oh 2 helped to enrich more n pgpb in the liquor by preventing them from mineralization interestingly as the unique substrate of n pgpb detected in this study aaas were largest accumulated after ath at 120 c fig 3b while the highest n pgpb were achieved until ath heating to 160 c fig 4a to further understand the process of aaas conversion into n pgpb during ath the aaas derived compounds for n pgpb production i e amides and amines precursors of n pgpb were analyzed based on gc ms data fig 4b the amides and amines of phenylacetamide phenylethylamine and tyramine were detected as the precursors of hpas and acas classified into n pgpba derived from phe and tyr while the amides and amines of indole acetamide and tryptamine were detected as the trp originated precursors of iaas and idds classified into n pgpbb in comparison two kinds of intermediates developed quickly in ath and reached the highest at 140 c showing 7 99 and 2 30 times of the optimal levels in th thus when compared to th it can be inferred ath was more efficient at releasing amino substrates and transferring them into relevant intermediates below 140 c thus resulting in a superior yield of n pgpb at 160 c 3 5 the mechanisms for the enhanced n pgpn and n pgpb production by ath treatment to figure out the component transformation mechanisms determining n pgpn and n pgpb production during th and ath treatments the 2d correlation ftir spectra were used to track the sequence of functional groups in samples analyzed in order fig 5 the band assignments for ftir spectral features were summarized in table s1 combining analysis of asynchronous and synchronous maps showed that during ath treatment the susceptibility of peaks in liquor samples with increasing temperature was 1340 1427 1567 1490 1030 1071 1142 cm 1 this indicated the sequence of functional groups in ath liquor from 100 c to 180 c were 1 coh and co associated with amino acids 2 conh of amide ii coo stretches associated with amino acids and carboxylic acid 3 co and coh stretch derived from polysaccharides moreover the synchronous map of ath liquor showed negative correlations between peaks of 1567 1490 1427 cm 1 and 1030 1070 1142 cm 1 clearly during ath treatment the protein hydrolysis with amino acids production could be achieved at low temperatures as the temperature increased the amino acids and amide ii downshifted while the solubilization of polysaccharides turned to be significant as for th liquor the changes of peaks in samples with the temperature increase followed the order 1406 1580 1040 1193 1458 1621 1714 cm 1 1040 1367 cm 1 and 1040 1280 cm 1 results implied the sequence of functional groups feature as 1 carboxyl groups associated with amino acids conh of amide i 2 co and coh from polysaccharides 3 co and coh from polysaccharides conh of amine ii nh2 of amide i ketones and carboxyl groups additionally there were two more kinds of groups of amino acids 1367 cm 1 and amide iii 1280 cm 1 being active after that of polysaccharides 1040 cm 1 thus this order suggested that in th treatment most amino acids and amides were produced after the release of polysaccharides it is worth noting that in the organic waste treatment the polysaccharides solubilization and denaturation usually occur under 140 165 c barber 2016 carrere et al 2010 xiao and zhou 2020 hence the protein hydrolysis with amino acids and amides production required high temperatures in single th moreover as the temperature further increased with the positive correlation in the synchronous map of th liquor one more feature of polysaccharides 1193 cm 1 might be consumed along with amino acids and amides 1458 1621 1714 cm 1 this can be caused by maillard reaction ioannou et al 2017 which is an array of non enzymatic consecutive and parallel chemical reactions between reduced sugar and amino acids generally the maillard reaction could be divided into three stages i the condensation of the reducing sugar with the amino groups via formation of schiff s base and the amadori rearrangement to the so called amadori product ii the breakdown of the amadori product into numerous fission products of the sugar amino compound iii the condensation of amino compounds and sugar fragments into polymerized protein and brown pigments called melanoidins kumar and naresh 2017 further corresponding to the characteristics of maillard reaction with the early or simultaneous polysaccharides downshift the occurrence of 1367 cm 1 may be attributed to the in schiff s base the product from the first step of the critical amino carbonyl reaction additionally the feature of 1621 cm 1 can be regarded as the amino backbone left in the final products of maillard reaction ioannou et al 2017 however in ath treatment the polysaccharides downshift appeared at the last and there was no characteristic peak of maillard reaction products observed in ath spectra suggesting ath could reduce the maillard reaction information provided from 2d correlation ftir maps was consistent with the results of n pgpb intermediates changes as the temperature increased in the range of 100 140 c the protein hydrolysis with the production of free amino acids and n pgpb s precursors were much greater in ath liquor than that in th liquor figs 3b and 4b on the contrary for single th the development of protein hydrolysis requires a high temperature over 140 c in which case the amino materials are easily condensed with denatured polysaccharides through maillard reaction results of this study highlight the important protein hydrolysis and amino conversion towards specific n pgpb s precursors should be achieved before the release of polysaccharides for producing high n pgpn and n pgpb but also for avoiding maillard reaction this order should be considered in developing thermal related technologies to recover n pgpn and n pgpb from waste organics 3 6 field study the characteristics of sludge liquor generated after ath treatment at 120 c in a field study using sewage sludge from a wwtp in rugao are listed in table s2 the effects of ath in pilot scale on n solubilization 63 59 of tsn tn seed germination stimulation 105 9 of gi as well as metals reduction were consistent with that achieved on the lab scale table 3 compares the performance of crop quantity and crop growth after applying sludge liquor fertilizer and urea fertilizer respectively the results showed that the average fresh pod yield of soybean reached 9000 kg hm2 after using sludge liquor which was 20 higher than that obtained in the urea group also the fresh weight per 100 soybeans in the sludge liquor group 155 g was 12 3 higher than that in the urea group 138 g moreover the application of sludge liquor effectively reduced the single pod rate to 7 8 which is about half of that in the urea group in terms of crop growth the seed germination index gi after using sludge liquor was 6 4 higher than that using urea fertilizer more distinctively in the sludge liquor group the average root hairs significantly became thicker fig s2 the number of root hairs per plant exceed 50 after applying sludge liquor whereas it was only 10 20 in the urea group besides the similar ph of the test field soil before 7 56 and after 7 49 soybean planting suggested there was no phenomenon of salinization by applying sludge liquor thus compared with the urea fertilizer the sludge liquor generated after ath at 120 c already significantly improved soybean yields under the field condition it could be expected that the promotion of plant growth and yield with sludge liquor produced after ath treatment at 140 160 c may be more promising as higher n pgpn and n pgpb could be produced as suggested by the lab scale investigation however the field study is worthy to be conducted in future to further verify the fertilizing effect of sludge liquor produced after ath treatment at 140 160 c 3 7 perspective of the application of liquid fertilizer produced from sewage sludge with ath treatment this study demonstrated that the ath treatment of sewage sludge could produce sludge liquor which is rich in n pgpn and n pgpb it further proved that the sludge liquor produced by ath could be used as the liquid fertilizer facilitating plant growth without inducing heavy metal contamination and soil salinization these results suggested ath treatment can be a promising technology to recovery n containing resources from sewage sludge for agriculture application the technology is especially suitable for the sewage sludge with a low vs ts ratio as it can achieve dual goals of sludge treatment for such sludge i e sludge reduction and resource recovery while the traditional biotreatment such as anaerobic digestion is not applicable cieślik et al 2015 yang et al 2015 to achieve high n pgpn and n pgpb production in the liquid fertilizer with significant gi increase the optimal temperature of ath should be set at 140 160 c as indicated by lab scale experiments however the field study revealed that ath at 120 c could already achieve significant improvement on crop yields compared to conventional urea fertilizer moreover the calcium alkali is more recommended in the ath process than the sodium and potassium alkali for n pgpn and n pgpb recovery one reason is that the presence of ca2 can more efficiently reduce hydrogen bonds and induce a high ionic strength as compared to na and k and thus it is believed to facilitate the solubilization of larger high mw and or hydrophobic proteins silva et al 2017 in addition as one of polyvalent metals the ca2 ions might act as coagulants to bind carboxyl in amino acids to enhance the stability of dissolved organic matrix chen et al 2016 xu et al 2017 this effect of ca2 may also support the greater retention of son and more stable existence of n pgpb in ath liquor than in th liquor thus for practical application the ath conditions for liquid fertilizer production should be optimized after comprehensively considering multiple factors such as crop yields energy consumption and operational ease and so on in addition researches have been suggested that the n pgpn and n pgpb may not only promote plant growth but also could active soil microorganisms and chelate hazard materials which would be beneficial to enhance the arability of the land in long term operation cao et al 2016 jones et al 2005 thus the effect of n pgpn and n pgpb in liquid fertilizer produced from sewage sludge by ath treatment on soil microorganisms and soil properties are worthy to be investigated in the future 4 conclusion this study investigated the feasibility of using alkaline thermal hydrolysis ath to produce liquid fertilizer with nitrogen containing plant growth promoting nutrients n pgpn and biostimulants n pgpb and the main conclusion could be drawn as follow 1 the ath treatment promoted the sludge reduction with enhanced organic nitrogen release and maintenance in sludge liquor due to the presence of ca oh 2 which would benefit n pgpn and n pgpb production and accumulation in sludge liquor 2 the major n pgpn produced in sludge liquor after ath treatment were free amino acids which are followed by soluble protein and soluble humic substances their productions were most significantly increased when the temperature increased to 120 140 c 3 the n pgpb produced in sludge liquor were mainly indole 3 acetic acid and hydroxyphenyl acetic acids known as phytohormones and indolic derives and aromatic carboxylic acids known as allelochemicals the highest n pgpb production by ath treatment was achieved at 160 c 4 substantial release of protein derives and their conversion towards n pgpb intermediates before the solubilization and denaturation of polysaccharides with temperature increased thus avoiding maillard reaction is a key reason for achieving high n pgpn and n pgpb production by ath treatment 5 the usage of ath liquor improved the plant growth without inducing heavy metal contamination and soil salinization suggesting ath is a promising technology for producing high quality liquid fertilizer from sewage sludge this method is suitable for the sludge with a low vs ts ratio as for such sludge the biological treatment is inapplicable declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

16308,efficient treatment of challenging oily emulsion wastewater can alleviate water pollution to provide more chances for water reuse and resource recovery despite their promising application potential conventional porous ceramic membranes have challenging bottleneck issues such as high cost and insufficient permeance this study presents a new strategy for highly efficient treatment of not only synthetic but real oily emulsions via unexpensive whisker constructed ceramic membranes exhibiting exceptional permeance and less energy input compared with common ceramic membranes such lower cost mullite membranes with a novel whisker constructed structure show higher porosity and water permeance and better surface oleophobicity in water treatment performance such as permeate flux and oil rejection was explored for the oily emulsions with different properties under key operating parameters furthermore classical hermia models were used to reveal membrane fouling mechanism to well understand the microscopic interactions between emulsion droplets and membrane interface even for real acidic oily wastewater such membranes also exhibit high permeance and less energy consumption outperforming most state of the art ceramic membranes this work provides a new structure concept of highly permeably whisker constructed porous ceramic membranes that can efficiently enable more water separation applications graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords oily wastewater membrane fouling ceramic membrane water permeance low energy consumption 1 introduction oily wastewater is generated in various domestic and industrial processes such as oil and gas food and beverage and metal processing which poses significant threats to our ecological environment when discharged into soil and water bodies ahmadun et al 2009 gupta et al 2017 zhu et al 2018 some conventional techniques such as gravity or centrifugal separation coagulation adsorption and flotation are more suitable for treatment of common suspended or dispersed oily wastewaters han et al 2015 in contrast it is a critical challenge to efficiently treat more stable oil in water o w emulsions with smaller size ranging from nanometer to micrometer zhu et al 2017 for which these conventional techniques cannot perform well to this end emerging membrane separation technology is considered as a promising sustainable method to efficiently treat o w emulsion wastewater due to its unique merits such as high separation efficiency small footprint and environmental friendliness chemicals free low energy consumption etc tanudjaja et al 2019 zhuang et al 2020 despite promising performance most studies only focus on the treatment of synthetic o w emulsions with moderate conditions besides major composition emulsified oil real oily wastewaters also contain other complicated compositions such as surfactants organic matters inorganic salts and hydrocarbons yang et al 2012 compared with polymeric membranes robust ceramic membranes are more suitable for harsh environmental separation applications e g real acidic oily wastewater treatment due to their high chemical thermal and mechanical stabilities and excellent anti oil fouling property gutierrez et al 2011 lu et al 2016 mustafa et al 2016 wang et al 2022 however for oily wastewater treatment current state of the art ceramic membranes still suffer from some challenging technical challenges such as high production cost insufficient permeance and membrane fouling compared with expensive commercial counterparts lower cost mineral based ceramic membranes such as mullite and spinel are increasingly considered chen et al 2020 dong et al 2009 fu et al 2019 and are promising for economic treatment of o w emulsion wastewater considering their moderate performance it is required to further improve water treatment efficiency via enhancing their water permeance and antifouling ability dudchenko et al 2015 for conventional membrane structure the strategies for improving water permeance are always at the cost of other property degradation such as membrane strength and oil rejection das et al 2020a das et al 2020b besides separation capability rational tailoring of membrane surface wettability is the core of lower fouling membrane separation process huang et al 2018 wei et al 2018 xue et al 2014 since membrane fouling is always a major drawback for long term filtration to address such a membrane fouling issue coating of more hydrophilic nano layers is an effective modification technique chang et al 2014 gao and xu 2019 zhang et al 2009 but which still suffers from complicated process and possible unfavorable release of nano materials therefore new protocols of enhancing permeance and anti fouling ability are highly desired for developing low cost ceramic membranes enabling efficient separation of o w emulsion wastewater moreover understanding of membrane fouling models and mechanisms is also important to probe complicated interactions between oil droplets and membrane surface at various emulsion properties and operating conditions which are more significant but few concerned for ceramic membranes in this work we demonstrate a novel protocol for efficient treatment of both synthetic and real oily wastewaters with low energy consumption via employing whisker structured ceramic membranes featuring lower processing cost higher porosity and permeance particularly enhanced underwater oleophobicity was realized for this novel structure with higher surface roughness improving the possibility of anti oil fouling ability different from some existing reports focusing on membrane structure and property comparison chen et al 2016 fu et al 2019 liu et al 2020 our current work focuses on detailed separation performance and especially membrane fouling mechanism separation performance was systematically investigated for various emulsion properties oil concentration and ph and operating conditions cross flow velocity and trans membrane pressure beyond performance membrane fouling models were further employed to provide new scientific insights into interaction mechanisms between oil droplets and membrane surface at various conditions moreover it is demonstrated that the whisker structured membranes have promising potential for efficient treatment of harsh acidic real oily wastewaters from machinery factories at optimized operating conditions 2 experimental procedure 2 1 membrane fabrication the hollow fiber whisker structured mullite based ceramic membranes were fabricated via a dry wet spinning technique with the immersion induced phase inversion process chen et al 2020 dong et al 2018 coal fly ash ningbo city zhejiang province china and bauxite yangquan city shanxi province china were mixed following the theoretical 3 2 mullite 3al2o3 2sio2 with or without wo3 addition which were labeled as w20 membranes 20 wt wo3 and w0 membranes without wo3 fig s1 and table s1 based on previous work chen et al 2016 20 wt wo3 as additive was determined as an optimum after studying the effect of wo3 contents on phase composition structure and properties of mullite membranes more detailed dry wet spinning and sintering parameters can be found in fig s2 and table s2 the dimensions of w0 and w20 hollow fiber membranes at various sintering temperatures are also shown in table s3 2 2 membrane characterization the surface and cross sectional morphologies of mullite membranes were observed using scanning electron microscopy sem quanta 450 fei america to characterize the surface hydrophilicity and underwater oleophobicity of mullite membranes water contact angle wca and underwater oil contact angle oca measurements were performed using a dynamic contact angle goniometer pt 705 guangdong zhongcheng pussett equipment co ltd china atomic force microscopy afm dimension icon bruker america was used to measure the surface roughness of mullite based ceramic membranes x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermos k alpha america was used to characterize the surface composition of w0 and w20 membranes membrane surface charge was measured by a solid surface zeta potential tester surpass anton paar austria the crystalline phases of mullite membranes at different sintering temperatures with or without wo3 addition were identified by x ray powder diffractor xrd d max 2400 japanese institute of neo confucianism japan with a cu kα radiation source in the 2θ range of 5 80 the mullite phase contents can be calculated quantitatively according to the normalized reference intensity ratio rir method pore size distributions and n2 permeance were measured by a porometer psda 20 nanjing gaoq functional material co ltd china the porosity was calculated based on weighing method while the theoretical density of mullite 3 16 g cm 3 2 3 performance evaluation 2 3 1 synthetic and real oily wastewaters the o w emulsions with different concentrations 250 500 1000 mg l 1 were synthetized by adding a set amount of vacuum pump oil into deionized water and then ultrasonicating for 6 h in a sonicator tank in order to stabilize the emulsion system sodium dodecyl sulfate sds the mass ratio of sds and oil was 1 10 was added into the o w mixtures the o w mixtures were then placed on a magnetic stirrer and vigorously stirred for 48 h to obtain stable o w emulsions with different concentrations chen et al 2020 the maximum absorption wavelength and calibration chart of pump oil were measured by uv visible spectroscopy uv 5500 shanghai yuanjie instrument co ltd china fig s3 light microscopy images of o w emulsions at various concentrations were also characterized by an optical microscope ix83 olympus japan fig s4a 4c the oil droplet size distributions and zeta potentials of both synthetic o w emulsions and real oily wastewater were measured by a malvern mastersizer analyzer zs 90 malvern instruments ltd britain the ph values of synthetic o w emulsions were measured by a portable ph meter phs 3c shanghai yidian scientific instrument co ltd china the real oily wastewater ph 3 86 was collected from a machinery factory dalian city liaoning province china more detailed sample properties of synthetic and real oily wastewaters were shown in table s4 the feed wastewater contains high chemical oxygen demand cod 26 865 mg l 1 high total suspended solids tss 1585 mg l 1 and inorganic salts 9 28 ms cm 1 in addition such oily wastewater has a wide concentration level of ammonia nitrogen 10 400 mg l 1 and total phosphorus 3 6 160 mg l 1 the oil concentrations of feed and permeate for real oily wastewater were measured by infrared oil detector jc oil 8 qingdao juchuang environmental protection co ltd china 2 3 2 performance evaluation for oily wastewaters the membrane separation experiments of synthetic and real oily wastewaters were carried out in a laboratory made cross flow filtration apparatus fig s5 separation performance was conducted at various emulsion properties oil concentration and ph and operating conditions cross flow velocity and trans membrane pressure the permeate volume was recorded at intervals of 5 min for a total period of 300 min 5 cycles to investigate the regeneration ability of the fabricated ceramic membranes after each separation cycle the membranes were first washed using 0 1 wt naoh solution for 10 min then with deionized water for 20 30 min to remove the oil droplets adhered on the membrane surface and pore structure all the experiments were conducted at room temperature 25 c the permeate flux j l m 2 h 1 and oil rejection r were calculated according to the following equations by weighing permeate every 5 min on a digital balance zhu et al 2019 1 j v a δ t 2 r 1 c p c f 100 where v l is the permeation volume a m2 is the effective membrane area and δt h is the operating time c f mg l 1 and c p mg l 1 are the oil concentrations of feed and permeate respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 enhanced membrane properties and underwater oleophobicity the addition of wo3 during membrane fabrication not only accelerated the formation of more mullite phase at lower temperature but resulted in the enhancement of porosity pore size n2 permeance and water permeance especially at higher temperature fig 1 a 1e and fig s7 for example via the progressive reaction of various crystal phases cristobalite and corundum sainz et al 2000 mullite phase as high as 94 could be formed at 1200 c for w20 membranes through a dissolution precipitation reaction process while only 75 mullite phase was achieved for w0 membranes even at a higher temperature of 1400 c fig s6 and table s5 compared with higher sintering temperature 1400 c w0 membranes 1500 1700 c commercial ceramic membranes monash et al 2013 such low temperature 1200 c could significantly lower membrane fabrication cost in spite of enhanced permeance at higher temperature even at 1200 c w20 membranes still showed sufficient water permeance 9400 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 which is higher than most current ceramic membranes ranging from 500 to 6000 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 abbasi et al 2010 abbasi et al 2012 fang et al 2013 kumar et al 2016 li et al 2018 moreover even at similar porosity w20 membranes have higher mechanical strength than w0 membranes that is to say w20 membranes have higher porosity than w0 at the same strength w0 membranes suffer from a trade off between strength and porosity yang et al 2002 while w20 membranes do not fig 1f such a phenomenon can be attributed to the higher fracture energy of whisker membrane structure than conventional particulate packing membrane structure meng and peng 2013 zhu et al 2015 therefore the w20 membranes sintered at 1200 c were selected in the following studies considering their lower projected membrane cost high mullite content and sufficient gas water permeance especially suitable pore size 0 7 μm lower than oil droplet size 0 8 1 0 μm understanding the surface structure and property of ceramic membranes is important for o w emulsions separation different from conventional particle structure w0 as well as commercial ceramic membranes a novel structure of interlocking mullite whiskers was formed for w20 membranes that can be controlled by sintering fig 2 a1 and 2a2 figs s8 and s9 zhu et al 2015 this unique whisker microstructure formed due to the anisotropical growth of mullite crystals in an unconstrained environment where lower mullitization temperature 1200 c promoted the solid dissolution of al2o3 into sio2 to form mullite whiskers with wo3 addition with the presence of little glassy phase particles chen et al 2016 kong et al 2003 furthermore for such membrane structure surface roughness root mean square deviation rq was also enhanced from 294 53 w0 to 508 81 nm w20 fig 2b1 and 2b2 compared w0 membranes w20 membranes are more hydrophilic in air wca 12 0 1 6 and more oleophobic under water oca 146 3 2 9 fig 2c1 fig 2c2 fig s10 and fig s11 this can be attributed to higher surface roughness and more surface hydroxyl groups si oh and al oh fig s12 this can be understood based on the principle of cassie baxter and wenzel equations which indicates that a hydrophilic surface θ 90 with a high interfacial free energy becomes more hydrophilic with increasing roughness duran and laroche 2019 therefore we can expect that whisker structured w20 membranes would be more easily wetted by water to form an oleophobic layer at the membrane surface and that such water wetted membranes would show a stronger ability of repelling oil droplets i e better anti oil fouling propensity during o w emulsions separation in the following studies whisker structured w20 membranes average pore size 0 7 μm were selected for the treatment of synthetic o w emulsions oil droplet size 1 0 μm with various emulsion properties feed oil concentration and ph value and operating conditions cross velocity and trans membrane pressure and finally real oily wastewater oil droplet size 0 8 μm at optimized conditions 3 2 separation performance for o w emulsions 3 2 1 effect of emulsion properties in this work emulsion properties were first studied including feed oil concentration and ph value at low trans membrane pressure 0 15 bar whisker structured membranes w20 membranes could perform well for the treatment of emulsion feeds with oil concentration ranging from 250 to 1000 mg l 1 featuring high oil rejection 95 99 stabilized permeate flux and good regeneration ability oil droplets rapidly accumulated on the membrane surface hua et al 2007 vasanth et al 2013 resulting in the formation of a fouling layer and consequently flux rapidly declines in the initial stages 10 min fig 3 a with increasing operation time flux declined very slowly because such an oil fouling layer became more dynamically stable in this work hereinafter the steady permeate flux is defined as the flux that keep relatively stable when a stable fouling layer was formed during each separation cycle at higher oil concentration e g 1000 mg l 1 permeate flux decreased more rapidly due to severer membrane fouling with more oil droplets accumulated on membrane surface and blocked inside pores fig 3e resulting a lower steady flux 60 l m 2 h 1 and high oil rejection 99 fig 3b in contrast in spite of slightly lowered but still high oil rejection 95 97 sufficient permeate fluxes were obtained with mitigated membrane fouling i e low water in air contact angles of fouled membranes figs 3c and 3d fig s13 at lower oil concentrations 135 l m 2 h 1 at 500 mg l 1 217 l m 2 h 1 at 250 mg l 1 for ceramic membranes one of their unique advantages is strong chemical acid base resistance in this work the performance and fouling behavior of whisker structured membranes iep 4 58 are closely dependent on the ph values of emulsions in the separation system where ph values would affect the surface charge of both ceramic membrane and emulsified oil droplets lobo et al 2006 nagasawa et al 2020 in spite of their similar oil droplets size the surface charges i e zeta potentials varied but were all negatively charged at different ph values after stabilization by anionic surfactants fig 4 f and 4g at strongly acidic conditions ph 3 the permeate flux declined more dramatically consequently attenuating separation performance with worse permeate flux and oil rejection at both initial and steady stages fig 4a and 4b this can be attributed to the severe membrane fouling i e high water in air contact angles of fouled membranes fig 4c 4e and fig s14 resulting from electrostatic attraction between negatively charged oil droplets and positively charged membrane surface fig 4g manttari et al 2006 unlike electrostatic attraction ph 3 electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged membrane surface and oil droplets played a key role in membrane fouling mitigation at ph 6 fig s14 nagasawa et al 2020 resulting in significantly enhanced initial steady permeate flux 515 l m 2 h 1 135 l m 2 h 1 moreover a further increase of steady permeate flux 188 l m 2 h 1 was achieved with high oil rejection 97 5 at ph 9 fig 4a and 4b in addition after 5 cycle operation the concentrations of metal ions in the permeates were also measured which are much lower than the criterion values drinking water quality who at various ph values table s6 confirming the excellent stability and risk free characteristics of such whisker structured membranes in this work 3 2 2 effect of operation parameters operation parameters were then studied including cross flow velocity and trans membrane pressure the whisker structured ceramic membranes showed enhanced permeate flux with increasing cross flow velocities while maintaining high oil rejection 95 99 the flux declined rapidly in the first 40 min as a result of increasing fouling resistance and concentration polarization fig 5 a which were caused by the formation of a dynamic oil layer on membrane surface and pore blocking within porous ceramic structure chen et al 2020 vasanth et al 2013 with increasing cross velocity from 0 40 to 1 02 m s 1 the steady permeate flux was enhanced from 58 to 135 l m 2 h 1 fig 5b at higher cross flow velocities the concentration polarization could be mitigated due to enhanced turbulence and shear force near the membrane surface inhibiting the accumulation of oil droplets kumar et al 2015 nabi et al 2000 this can be also supported by the sem images of membrane surface with mitigated fouling i e low water in air contact angles of fouled membranes fig 5c 5e fig s15 1 02 m s 1 was selected for further consideration as no significant improvement was achieved for permeate flux with further increasing cross flow velocity 2 31 m s 1 moreover after simple chemical cleaning the flux recovery rate of w20 membranes was as high as 85 90 of original flux indicating a promising regeneration ability trans membrane pressure was the other important operation parameter to influence permeate flux and oil rejection chang et al 2014 when trans membrane pressure increased from 0 1 to 0 15 bar the steady permeate flux significantly increased from 60 to 135 l m 2 h 1 indicating a positive effect on the increase of permeate flux with trans membrane pressure further increased to 0 2 bar the increment of permeate flux was lower as expected only 45 l m 2 h 1 lower than 75 l m 2 h 1 from 0 1 to 0 15 bar despite high oil rejection of 99 fig 6 a and 6b this may be attributed to the plugging of membrane pores by oil droplets which deformed at higher trans membrane pressure bansal et al 2011 it was again verified by the sem images of membrane surface with severer fouling i e higher water in air contact angles of fouled membrane fig 6c 6e fig s16 therefore a trans membrane pressure of 0 15 bar was selected for further work considering sufficient permeate flux and low energy consumption fig 8c

membrane surface for w20 membranes membrane fouling models were employed at various operation conditions based on the fitting results via hermia models fig s17 hermia 1982 increasing oil concentration resulted in a transition from a combined fouling model intermediate pore blocking and cake filtration to cake filtration model fig s18 due to the more rapid formation of dynamically stable oil layer at higher oil concentration e g 1000 mg l 1 even at various ph values cake filtration model dominated membrane fouling under low pressure operation 0 15 bar where electrostatic interaction energy u el varied with ph values but are not sufficient to change fouling models as other operation conditions such as cross flow velocity and trans membrane pressure fig s19 to analyze membrane fouling at various ph values quantification of electrostatic interaction energy u el was performed as a function of the distance between membrane surface and oil droplets by applying the derjaguin s technique tanudjaja and chew 2018 tanudjaja et al 2019 an entirely electrostatic attraction interaction u mlf el 0 occurred at ph 3 which accelerated the adsorption of foulants oil droplets on membrane surface in the initial filtration stage while electrostatic repulsion u mlf el 0 prevented membrane fouling at ph 6 and 9 fig s22 the variations of electrostatic interaction energy also support the permeate decline results fig 4a enhanced cross flow velocity resulted in the change of fouling models from intermediate pore blocking to cake filtration at a low velocity 0 40 m s 1 oil droplets were more easily deposited either on other deposited oil droplets or directly on whisker structured membrane surface during this cross flow filtration in contrast cake filtration dominated membrane fouling at higher cross flow velocity while higher cross flow velocity avoided this blocking phenomena due to the greater lift force impacted on oil droplets fig s20 similarly enhancing trans membrane pressure also change membrane fouling model from a combined fouling intermediate and standard pore blocking to cake filtration fig s21 in our study cake filtration model could well predict membrane fouling for the treatment of high concentration o w emulsions at high cross flow velocity and trans membrane pressure where oil droplets were easily deformed and squeezed to form a stable cake fouling layer on

16308,efficient treatment of challenging oily emulsion wastewater can alleviate water pollution to provide more chances for water reuse and resource recovery despite their promising application potential conventional porous ceramic membranes have challenging bottleneck issues such as high cost and insufficient permeance this study presents a new strategy for highly efficient treatment of not only synthetic but real oily emulsions via unexpensive whisker constructed ceramic membranes exhibiting exceptional permeance and less energy input compared with common ceramic membranes such lower

rejection was explored for the oily emulsions with different properties under key operating parameters furthermore classical hermia models were used to reveal membrane fouling mechanism to well understand the microscopic interactions between emulsion droplets and membrane interface even for real acidic oily wastewater such membranes also exhibit high permeance and less energy consumption outperforming most state of the art ceramic membranes this work provides a new structure concept of highly permeably whisker constructed porous ceramic membranes that can efficiently enable more water separation applications graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords oily wastewater membrane fouling ceramic membrane water permeance low energy consumption 1 introduction oily wastewater is generated in various domestic and industrial processes such as oil and gas food and beverage and metal processing which poses significant threats to our ecological environment when discharged into soil and water bodies ahmadun et al 2009 gupta et al 2017 zhu et al 2018 some conventional techniques such as gravity or centrifugal separation coagulation adsorption and flotation are more suitable for treatment of common suspended or dispersed oily wastewaters han et al 2015 in contrast it is a critical challenge to efficiently treat more stable oil in water o w emulsions with smaller size ranging from nanometer to micrometer zhu et al 2017 for which these conventional techniques cannot perform well to this end emerging membrane separation technology is considered as a promising sustainable method to efficiently treat o w emulsion wastewater due to its unique merits such as high separation efficiency small footprint and environmental friendliness chemicals free low energy consumption etc tanudjaja et al 2019 zhuang et al 2020 despite promising performance most studies only focus on the treatment of synthetic o w emulsions with moderate conditions besides major composition emulsified oil real oily wastewaters also contain other complicated compositions such as surfactants organic matters inorganic salts and hydrocarbons yang et al 2012 compared with polymeric membranes robust ceramic membranes are more suitable for harsh environmental separation applications e g real acidic oily wastewater treatment due to their high chemical thermal and mechanical stabilities and excellent anti oil fouling property gutierrez et al 2011 lu et al 2016 mustafa et al 2016 wang et al 2022 however for oily wastewater treatment current state of the art ceramic membranes still suffer from some challenging technical challenges such as high production cost insufficient permeance and membrane fouling compared with expensive commercial counterparts lower cost mineral based ceramic membranes such as mullite and spinel are increasingly considered chen et al 2020 dong et al 2009 fu et al 2019 and are promising for economic treatment of o w emulsion wastewater considering their moderate performance it is required to further improve water treatment efficiency via enhancing their water permeance and antifouling ability dudchenko et al 2015 for conventional membrane structure the strategies for improving water permeance are always at the cost of other property degradation such as membrane strength and oil rejection das et al 2020a das et al 2020b besides separation capability rational tailoring of membrane surface wettability is the core of lower fouling membrane separation process huang et al 2018 wei et al 2018 xue et al 2014 since membrane fouling is always a major drawback for long term filtration to address such a membrane fouling issue coating of more hydrophilic nano layers is an effective modification technique chang et al 2014 gao and xu 2019 zhang et al 2009 but which still suffers from complicated process and possible unfavorable release of nano materials therefore new protocols of enhancing permeance and anti fouling ability are highly desired for developing low cost ceramic membranes enabling efficient separation of o w emulsion wastewater moreover understanding of membrane fouling models and mechanisms is also important to probe complicated interactions between oil droplets and membrane surface at various emulsion properties and operating conditions which are more significant but few concerned for ceramic membranes in this work we demonstrate a novel protocol for efficient treatment of both synthetic and real oily wastewaters with low energy consumption via employing whisker structured ceramic membranes featuring lower processing cost higher porosity and permeance particularly enhanced underwater oleophobicity was realized for this novel structure with higher surface roughness improving the possibility of anti oil fouling ability different from some existing reports focusing on membrane structure and property comparison chen et al 2016 fu et al 2019 liu et al 2020 our current work focuses on detailed separation performance and especially membrane fouling mechanism separation performance was systematically investigated for various emulsion properties oil concentration and ph and operating conditions cross flow velocity and trans membrane pressure beyond performance membrane fouling models were further employed to provide new scientific insights into interaction mechanisms between oil droplets and membrane surface at various conditions moreover it is demonstrated that the whisker structured membranes have promising potential for efficient treatment of harsh acidic real oily wastewaters from machinery factories at optimized operating conditions 2 experimental procedure 2 1 membrane fabrication the hollow fiber whisker structured mullite based ceramic membranes were fabricated via a dry wet spinning technique with the immersion induced phase inversion process chen et al 2020 dong et al 2018 coal fly ash ningbo city zhejiang province china and bauxite yangquan

and table s1 based on previous work chen et al 2016 20 wt wo3 as additive was determined as an optimum after studying the effect of wo3 contents on phase composition structure and properties of mullite membranes more detailed dry wet spinning and sintering parameters can be found in fig s2 and table s2 the dimensions of w0 and w20 hollow fiber membranes at various sintering temperatures are also shown in table s3 2 2 membrane characterization the surface and cross sectional morphologies of mullite membranes were observed using scanning electron microscopy sem quanta 450 fei america to

diffractor xrd d max 2400 japanese institute of neo confucianism japan with a cu kα radiation source in the 2θ range of 5 80 the mullite phase contents can be calculated quantitatively according to the normalized reference intensity ratio rir method pore size distributions and n2 permeance were measured by a porometer psda 20 nanjing gaoq functional material co ltd china the porosity was calculated based on weighing method while the theoretical density of mullite 3 16 g cm 3 2 3 performance evaluation 2 3 1 synthetic and real oily wastewaters the o w emulsions with different concentrations 250 500 1000 mg l 1 were synthetized by adding a set amount of vacuum pump oil into deionized water and then ultrasonicating for 6 h in a sonicator tank in order to stabilize the emulsion system sodium dodecyl sulfate sds the mass ratio of sds and oil was 1 10 was added into the o w mixtures the o w mixtures were then placed on a magnetic stirrer and vigorously stirred for 48 h to obtain stable o w emulsions with different concentrations chen et al 2020 the maximum absorption wavelength and calibration chart of pump oil were measured by uv visible spectroscopy uv 5500 shanghai yuanjie instrument co ltd china fig s3 light microscopy images of o w emulsions at various concentrations were also characterized by an optical microscope ix83 olympus japan fig s4a 4c the oil droplet size distributions and zeta potentials of both synthetic o w emulsions and real oily wastewater were measured by a malvern mastersizer analyzer zs 90 malvern instruments ltd britain the ph values of synthetic o w emulsions were measured by a portable ph meter phs 3c shanghai yidian scientific instrument co ltd china the real oily wastewater ph 3 86 was collected from a machinery factory dalian city liaoning province china more detailed sample properties of synthetic and real oily wastewaters were shown in table s4 the feed wastewater contains high chemical oxygen demand cod 26 865 mg l 1 high total suspended solids tss 1585 mg l 1 and inorganic salts 9 28 ms cm 1 in addition such oily wastewater has a wide concentration level of ammonia nitrogen 10 400 mg l 1 and total phosphorus 3 6 160 mg l 1 the oil concentrations of feed and permeate for real oily wastewater were measured by infrared oil detector jc oil 8 qingdao juchuang environmental protection co ltd china 2 3 2 performance evaluation for oily wastewaters the membrane separation experiments of synthetic and real oily wastewaters were carried out in a laboratory made cross flow filtration apparatus fig s5 separation performance was conducted at various emulsion properties oil concentration and ph and operating conditions cross flow velocity and trans membrane pressure the permeate volume was recorded at intervals of 5 min for a total period of 300 min 5 cycles to investigate the regeneration ability of the fabricated ceramic membranes after each separation cycle the membranes were first washed using 0 1 wt naoh solution for 10 min then with deionized water for 20 30 min to remove the oil droplets adhered on the membrane surface and pore structure all the experiments were conducted at room temperature 25 c the permeate flux j l m 2 h 1 and oil rejection r were calculated according to the following equations by weighing permeate every 5 min on a digital balance zhu et al 2019 1 j v a δ t 2 r 1 c p c f 100 where v l is the permeation volume a m2 is the effective membrane area and δt h is the operating time c f mg l 1 and c p mg l 1 are the oil concentrations of feed and permeate respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 enhanced membrane properties and underwater oleophobicity the addition of wo3 during membrane fabrication not only accelerated the formation of more mullite phase at lower temperature but resulted in the enhancement of porosity pore size n2 permeance and water permeance especially at higher temperature fig 1 a 1e and fig s7 for example via the progressive reaction of various crystal phases cristobalite and corundum sainz et al 2000 mullite phase as high as 94 could be formed at 1200 c for w20 membranes through a dissolution precipitation reaction process while only 75 mullite phase was achieved for w0 membranes even at a higher temperature of 1400 c fig s6 and table s5 compared with higher sintering temperature 1400 c w0 membranes 1500 1700 c commercial ceramic membranes monash et al 2013 such low temperature 1200 c could significantly lower membrane fabrication cost in spite of enhanced permeance at higher temperature even at 1200 c w20 membranes still showed sufficient water permeance 9400 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 which is higher than most current ceramic membranes ranging from 500 to 6000 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 abbasi et al 2010 abbasi et al 2012 fang et al 2013 kumar et al 2016 li et al 2018 moreover even at similar porosity w20 membranes have higher mechanical strength than w0 membranes that is to say w20 membranes have higher porosity than w0 at the same strength w0 membranes suffer from a trade off between strength and porosity yang et al 2002 while w20 membranes do not fig 1f such a phenomenon can be attributed to the higher fracture energy of whisker membrane structure than conventional particulate packing membrane structure meng and peng 2013 zhu et al 2015 therefore the w20 membranes sintered at 1200 c were selected in the following studies considering their lower projected membrane cost high mullite content and sufficient gas water permeance especially suitable pore size 0 7 μm lower than oil droplet size 0 8 1 0 μm understanding the surface structure and property of ceramic membranes is important for o w emulsions separation different from conventional particle structure w0 as well as commercial ceramic membranes a novel structure of interlocking mullite whiskers was formed for w20 membranes that can be controlled by sintering fig 2 a1 and 2a2 figs s8 and s9 zhu et al 2015 this unique whisker microstructure formed due to the anisotropical growth of mullite crystals in an unconstrained environment where lower mullitization temperature 1200 c promoted the solid dissolution of al2o3 into sio2 to form mullite whiskers with wo3 addition with the presence of little glassy phase particles chen et al 2016 kong et al 2003 furthermore for such membrane structure surface roughness root mean square deviation rq was also enhanced from 294 53 w0 to 508 81 nm w20 fig 2b1 and 2b2 compared w0 membranes w20 membranes are more hydrophilic in air wca 12 0 1 6 and more oleophobic under water oca 146 3 2 9 fig 2c1 fig 2c2 fig s10 and fig s11 this can be attributed to higher surface roughness and more surface hydroxyl groups si oh and al oh fig s12 this can be understood based on the principle of cassie baxter and wenzel equations which indicates that a hydrophilic surface θ 90 with a high interfacial free energy becomes more hydrophilic with increasing roughness duran and laroche 2019 therefore we can expect that whisker structured w20 membranes would be more easily wetted by water to form an oleophobic layer at the membrane surface and that such water wetted membranes would show a stronger ability of repelling oil droplets i e better anti oil fouling propensity during o w emulsions separation in the following studies whisker structured w20 membranes average pore size 0 7 μm were selected for the treatment of synthetic o w emulsions oil droplet size 1 0 μm with various emulsion properties feed oil concentration and ph value and operating conditions cross velocity and trans membrane pressure and finally real oily wastewater oil droplet size 0 8 μm at optimized conditions 3 2 separation performance for o w emulsions 3 2 1 effect of emulsion properties in this work emulsion properties were first studied including feed oil concentration and ph value at low trans membrane pressure 0 15 bar whisker structured membranes w20 membranes could perform well for the treatment of emulsion feeds with oil concentration ranging from 250 to 1000 mg l 1 featuring high oil rejection 95 99 stabilized permeate flux and good regeneration ability oil droplets rapidly accumulated on the membrane surface hua et al 2007 vasanth et al 2013 resulting in the formation of a fouling layer and consequently flux rapidly declines in the initial stages 10 min fig 3 a with increasing operation time flux declined very slowly because such an oil fouling layer became more dynamically stable in this work hereinafter the steady permeate flux is defined as the flux that keep relatively stable when a stable fouling layer was formed during each separation cycle at higher oil concentration e g 1000 mg l 1 permeate flux decreased more rapidly due to severer membrane fouling with more oil droplets accumulated on membrane surface and blocked inside pores fig 3e resulting a lower steady flux 60 l m 2 h 1 and high oil rejection 99 fig 3b in contrast in spite of slightly lowered but still high oil rejection 95 97 sufficient permeate fluxes were obtained with mitigated membrane fouling i e low water in air contact angles of fouled membranes figs 3c and 3d fig s13 at lower oil concentrations 135 l m 2 h 1 at 500 mg l 1 217 l m 2 h 1 at 250 mg l 1 for ceramic membranes one of their unique advantages is strong chemical acid base resistance in this work the performance and fouling behavior of whisker structured membranes iep 4 58 are closely dependent on the ph values of emulsions in the separation system where ph values would affect the surface charge of both ceramic membrane and emulsified oil droplets lobo et al 2006 nagasawa et al 2020 in spite of their similar oil droplets size the surface charges i e zeta potentials varied but were all negatively charged at different ph values after stabilization by anionic surfactants fig 4 f and 4g at strongly acidic conditions ph 3 the permeate flux declined more dramatically consequently attenuating separation performance with worse permeate flux and oil rejection at both initial and steady stages fig 4a and 4b this can be attributed to the severe membrane fouling i e high water in air contact angles of fouled membranes fig 4c 4e and fig s14 resulting from electrostatic attraction between negatively charged oil droplets and positively charged membrane surface fig 4g manttari et al 2006 unlike electrostatic attraction ph 3 electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged membrane surface and oil droplets played a key role in membrane fouling mitigation at ph 6 fig s14 nagasawa et al 2020 resulting in significantly enhanced initial steady permeate flux 515 l m 2 h 1 135 l m 2 h 1 moreover a further increase of steady permeate flux 188 l m 2 h 1 was achieved with high oil rejection 97 5 at ph 9 fig 4a and 4b in addition after 5 cycle operation the concentrations of metal ions in the permeates were also measured which are much lower than the criterion values drinking water quality who at various ph values table s6 confirming the excellent stability and risk free characteristics of such whisker structured membranes in this work 3 2 2 effect of operation parameters operation parameters were then studied including cross flow velocity and trans membrane pressure the whisker structured ceramic membranes showed enhanced permeate flux with increasing cross flow velocities while maintaining high oil rejection 95 99 the flux declined rapidly in the first 40 min as a result of increasing fouling resistance and concentration polarization fig 5 a which were caused by the formation of a dynamic oil layer on membrane surface and pore blocking within porous ceramic structure chen et al 2020 vasanth et al 2013 with increasing cross velocity from 0 40 to 1 02 m s 1 the steady permeate flux was enhanced from 58 to 135 l m 2 h 1 fig 5b at higher cross flow velocities the concentration polarization could be mitigated due to enhanced turbulence and shear force near the membrane surface inhibiting the accumulation of oil droplets kumar et al 2015 nabi et al 2000 this can be also supported by the sem images of membrane surface with mitigated fouling i e low water in air contact angles of fouled membranes fig 5c 5e fig s15 1 02 m s 1 was selected for further consideration as no significant improvement was achieved for permeate flux with further increasing cross flow velocity 2 31 m s 1 moreover after simple chemical cleaning the flux recovery rate of w20 membranes was as high as 85 90 of original flux indicating a promising regeneration ability trans membrane pressure was the other important operation parameter to influence permeate flux and oil rejection chang et al 2014 when trans membrane pressure increased from 0 1 to 0 15 bar the steady permeate flux significantly increased from 60 to 135 l m 2 h 1 indicating a positive effect on the increase of permeate flux with trans membrane pressure further increased to 0 2 bar the increment of permeate flux was lower as expected only 45 l m 2 h 1 lower than 75 l m 2 h 1 from 0 1 to 0 15 bar despite high oil rejection of 99 fig 6 a and 6b this may be attributed to the plugging of membrane pores by oil droplets which deformed at higher trans membrane pressure bansal et al 2011 it was again verified by the sem images of membrane surface with severer fouling i e higher water in air contact angles of fouled membrane fig 6c 6e fig s16 therefore a trans membrane pressure of 0 15 bar was selected for further work considering sufficient permeate flux and low energy consumption fig 8c and 8d 3 2 3 mechanistic insight on membrane fouling understanding of membrane fouling is important for membrane filtration system to probe interactions between oil droplets and whisker structured

tanudjaja and chew 2018 tanudjaja et al 2019 an entirely electrostatic attraction interaction u mlf el 0 occurred at ph 3 which accelerated the adsorption of foulants oil droplets on membrane surface in the initial filtration stage while electrostatic repulsion u mlf el 0 prevented membrane fouling at ph 6 and 9 fig s22 the variations of electrostatic interaction energy also support the permeate decline results fig 4a enhanced cross flow velocity resulted in the change of fouling models from intermediate pore blocking to cake filtration at a low velocity 0 40 m s 1 oil droplets were more easily deposited either on other deposited oil droplets or directly on whisker structured membrane surface during this cross flow filtration in contrast cake filtration dominated membrane fouling at higher cross flow velocity while higher cross flow velocity avoided this blocking phenomena due to the greater lift force impacted on oil droplets fig s20 similarly enhancing trans membrane pressure

homologues n 12 were detected at quantifiable concentrations 100 detection frequency in every near surface soil sample collected 0 30 cm bgs n 34 with total pfas 12pfas concentrations ranging from 73 to 196 µg kg 8pfca 30 98 µg kg and 4pfsa 43 100 µg kg the majority of targeted pfas excluding pfhpa and pfhxs were measured in substation surface soils at concentrations greater than respective method reporting limits fig 2 and table 1 in contrast those twelve homologues were nondetectable in soils collected from the irrigation ditch at the station note that in this study a maximum likelihood estimator mle of ½ the respective method detection limit 0 1 0 002 µg kg is employed to provide numerical values for nondetectable concentrations such as those measured from soils collected in the irrigation ditch the highest concentration of pfas was measured for pfos with surface soil concentrations ranging from 36 to 100 µg kg pfos was also the most abundantly detected pfas in the previously described short and long term field experiments conducted by sepulvado et al 2011 and pfos is commonly reported as the measured pfas burden in municipal biosolids such as those characterized as part of this study e g see table 2 the soil burden pfos pfda pfoa was measured at all substation sampling locations independent of the varying annual average loading rates at the respective substations fig 2 those same three compounds were indicated as the dominant pfass analyzed and detected at a field site in decatur al following 10 years of pfas industrial waste impacted biosolids application washington et al 2010 in this study total perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids 8pfcas and sulfonic acids 4pfsas averaged 58 µg kg and 67 µg kg respectively in the surface soils these total concentrations of pfcas are 1 order of magnitude higher than those reported as global background soil levels rankin et al 2016 and total pfsas are 2 orders of magnitude higher note that this comparison was made only for those homologues tested across both studies thereby including only pfhxa pfhpa pfoa pfna pfda pfunda pfdoda pfhxs pfos and pfds the average surface soil concentrations for pfoa ranged from 3 7 to 32 µg kg and measured median max concentrations for pfoa and pfos equaled 16 and 69 µg kg respectively these max soil concentrations are 5x higher than those reported in background soils from soil surveys brusseau et al 2020 finally considering nondetectable pfas homologues n 12 in soils collected from the station s irrigation ditch representing soils with no historic application of biosolids these findings suggest the presence of pfas in surface soils on the farm 0 30 cm bgs are associated with the historical land application of biosolids 3 2 pfas in soil profile results of pfas concentrations measured in soils representing the 30 60 cm bgs profile yielded 96 to 100 detection frequency detection frequencies in the 60 90 cm soil profile equal 83 94 with nondetectable nd concentrations of pfds and pfdoda found in the 60 90 cm profile for several soil samples at all substations additionally four out of 20 soil samples collected at ss3 had nd concentrations of pfbs these results suggest multiple pfas have vertically migrated through the soil profile at the station figure 2 overall the results show preferential leaching of short chain pfas compounds through the soil profile as can be seen in figure 2 inset and as has been previously reported in the literature e g washington et al 2010 baduel et al 2017 as discussed by the national research council nrc 2002 long term land application of biosolids may cause soil ph changes in this study soil ph ranged from 5 2 to 7 6 in the 0 30 cm soil layer and increased with depth see table 2 ranging from 6 9 to 9 6 in the 60 90 cm profile the suspected migration of pfas through the soil profile is possibly related to the measured increasing soil ph through that profile as sorption of pfas compounds have been shown to decrease with increasing ph arvaniti et al 2014 du et al 2014 specifically pfas variable sorption behavior with soil ph especially in the presence of ca 2 or mg 2 in water du et al 2014 may be associated with electrostatic interactions between pfas anions and positively charged surfaces of natural geomaterials such as metal oxide surfaces found in soils zareitalabad et al 2013 additionally while the overall sorption behavior of pfas is commonly reported to be dominantly associated with hydrophobic interactions onto organic matter of adsorbents higgins and luthy 2006 jeon et al 2013 the electrostatic surface potential of organic matter is a function of soil ph higgins and luthy 2007 jeon et al 2013 du et al 2014 pfas soil concentrations measured in core samples collected during well installation at the station suggest that pfoa and pfos have migrated through the surface soil profile to deeper soils of the vadose zone fig 3 quantifiable soil concentrations of pfoa were detected up to approximately 9 m bgs and up to 3 m bgs for pfos at the station with both pfoa and pfos detected in deeper soils up to 18 m bgs measured concentrations of pfoa in groundwater located approximately 17 m bgs were reported 0 029 µg l pfos in groundwater 0 002 µg l researchers have shown soil concentrations of pfas compounds are commonly detected at higher concentrations than corresponding soil pore waters with soil serving as a significant long term reservoir for pfas in the environment e g rankin et al 2016 brusseau 2018 has qualified multiple mechanisms potentially impacting the overall transport and fate behavior of pfoa and pfos through natural geomedia including air water partitioning and air water interfacial adsorption these phenomena commonly associated with pfas in the vadose zone contribute to long term sources of pfas to groundwater weber et al 2017 brusseau 2018 2019 3 3 pfas and biosolids loadings the highest total pfas soil concentrations including 12pfas 8pfca and 4pfsa were measured in surface soils collected from substations having the largest long term average biosolids loading rates as shown in table 3 linear regression results r2 0 97 indicate statistically significant linear correlations p value 0 005 between measured 12pfas 8pfca and 4pfsa and the respective long term historical cumulative biosolids loading rates similarly statistically significant linear correlations between max soil concentrations of all twelve pfas r2 0 96 were also found similar linear relationships have been reported linking pfas soil concentrations to biosolids loadings washington et al 2010 sepulvado et al 2011 a comparison of the slopes describing this linear relationship for long chain c7 versus short chain compounds shows an order of magnitude increase in the slope for long chain average slope 0 02 versus short chain average slope 0 003 homologues these results suggest that long chain pfas compounds tend to be more bioaccumulative and environmentally persistent than short as previously reported in the literature washington et al 2010 buck et al 2011 sepulvado et al 2011 in this study pfas concentrations in the station s historical land applied biosolids beginning in the mid 1990s were not characterized as is commonly the case in these agricultural field studies without that historical record the impact of the temporal and seasonal variation of pfas expected in applied sewage sludge albeit significant cannot be qualified analysis of sludges collected in 2001 as part of the usepa targeted national sewage sludge survey nsss usepa 2009 reports select pfas concentrations in us sludges venkatesan and halden 2013 combining the reported biosolids loadings for substations in this study with those reported average max and min concentrations for pfas tested across both studies n 11 pfas mass kg in surface soils 0 30 cm bgs were predicted and compared to those measured while the nsss average pfas concentrations underpredict the total mass of pfas measured in surface soils in this study by approximately 40 the max pfas concentrations effectively predict the measured total mass fig 4 it may be of interest to note that average pfas concentrations in sludges collected in the pacific northwest schultz et al 2005 and sludges collected in the western us higgins et al 2005 underpredict pfas total mass measured in this study by 70 while these results suggest that pfas concentrations characterized as part of usepa s nsss may be a predictive tool to estimate pfas in surface soils it is important to consider the significant impact of waste stream sources to pfas concentrations in wastewater treatment plant sludges 4 conclusions the concentrations of twelve pfas homologues were measured in surface soils deeper soils and in groundwater from agricultural fields following many years of repeated biosolids loadings measured soil concentrations were 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than pfas levels in global background soils with nondetectable levels of all twelve pfas homologues in soils collected from the station s irrigation ditch to which no biosolids were historically applied the contribution of pfas from treated wastewater appears negligible pfas soil levels were significantly correlated with respective biosolids loading rates at sampled substations independent of the time since last application of the planting and feedcrop harvesting and of the overall pattern of historical biosolids application these findings suggest a significant bioaccumulative and recalcitrant transport and fate behavior for pfas in our environment the observed distribution of multiple pfas through the near surface soil profile indicates preferential leaching of short chain pfas both pfos and pfoa were measured at quantifiable levels in the deeper soils of the vadose zone and in the immediately underlying groundwater located 17 m below ground with measured groundwater concentrations 1 to 2 orders of magnitude less than soil concentrations the significant role of retention processes in soil systems contributing to pfas overall transport and fate behavior in the subsurface is evident as well is the impact to overall soil quality as the first known study to characterize pfas in surface soils to deeper soils of the vadose zone and to immediately underlying groundwater following long term application of biosolids it is clear and prudent that additional efforts are needed to characterize the risk of land applying biosolids with reported emerging pollutants as they impact our soil

concentrations of pfoa than biosolids from municipal wastewater treatment plants washington et al 2010 lindstrom et al 2011 overall the results and analysis suggest pfas vertical migration beyond the zone of biosolids incorporation with increasing pfas surface soil concentrations directly proportional to the cumulative biosolids loading rates washington et al 2010 similar results showing pfas leaching through the soil profile as a function of short term and long term land application of municipal biosolids have been reported sepulvado et al 2011 additionally pepper et al 2021 reports pfas soil concentrations following 35 years of land application of biosolids in arizona with larger soil concentrations measured in soils receiving larger biosolids loading rates an extensive search of the literature indicates that the characterization of pfas following the long term land application of dewatered municipal biosolids including the vertical distribution in near surface soils to the deeper soil profile of the vadose zone and the immediate underlying groundwater has not been reported in this study the impact of land applying biosolids on the occurrence concentration and distribution of pfas in soils the vadose zone and the immediately underlying groundwater at an agricultural station with a long history of land applying biosolids plus irrigation using treated wastewater effluent for planted feedstock crops was investigated this is the first study to include the characterization of pfas following the land application of biosolids in near surface soils to deeper soils and to underlying groundwater surface soil samples were collected along a nearly 4600 m transect of an agricultural station with characterization of the soil concentrations and vertical distribution of twelve pfas homologues the differential behavior of short chain and long chain pfas is described additionally depth profiles for pfoa and pfos combining those measured surface soil concentrations in this study with soil and groundwater concentrations is also presented 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the field site is an agricultural feedstock station located in the western us according to soil surveys by the natural resources conservation service usda the region is mostly flat with ground slope 1 approximately 40 of the station s surface soil is composed of garces loam tennco and kimberlina fine sandy loams make up nearly 45 of the region with calflax loams covering approximately 5 of the area and calfax fine sandy loams making up close to 5 of the remaining soils usda wss 2020 the land application of dewatered biosolids from multiple publicly owned treatment works potw operating in a neighboring highly populated city began at the station mid 1990s loading class b product usepa 1994 with operations switching to class a product early 2000 to today biosolids incorporation at the site is typically conducted via cross discing ripping followed by cross discing again prior to seeding of feedstock crops on the farm irrigation operations at the station include flood irrigation of locally sourced reclaimed water from a nearby potw it may be of interest to note that the treated sewage sludge and the treated wastewater effluent both used to enhance farming operations at the station are generated at different potws in the region the agricultural station is surrounded by drainage ditches plus berms aimed to ensure containment of excess overflow of irrigation water see fig 1 2 2 sample collection near surface soil cores n 52 were collected from hand

homologues n 12 were detected at quantifiable concentrations 100 detection frequency in every near surface soil sample collected 0 30 cm bgs n 34 with total pfas 12pfas concentrations ranging from 73 to 196 µg kg 8pfca 30 98 µg kg and 4pfsa 43 100 µg kg the majority of targeted pfas excluding pfhpa and pfhxs were measured in substation surface soils at concentrations greater than respective method reporting limits fig 2 and table 1 in contrast those twelve homologues were nondetectable in soils collected from the irrigation ditch at the station note that in this study a maximum likelihood estimator mle of ½ the respective method detection limit 0 1 0 002 µg kg is employed to provide numerical values for nondetectable concentrations such as those measured from soils collected in the irrigation ditch the highest concentration of pfas was measured for pfos with surface soil concentrations ranging from 36 to 100 µg kg pfos was also the most abundantly detected pfas in the previously described short and long term field experiments conducted by sepulvado et al 2011 and pfos is commonly reported as the measured pfas burden in municipal biosolids such as those characterized as part of this study e g see table 2 the soil burden pfos pfda pfoa was measured at all substation sampling locations independent of the varying annual average loading rates at the respective substations fig 2 those same three compounds were indicated as the dominant pfass analyzed and detected at a field site in decatur al following 10 years of pfas industrial waste impacted biosolids application washington et al 2010 in this study total perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids 8pfcas and sulfonic acids 4pfsas averaged 58 µg kg and 67 µg kg respectively in the surface soils these total concentrations of pfcas are 1 order of magnitude higher than those reported as global background soil levels rankin et al 2016 and total pfsas are 2 orders of magnitude higher note that this comparison was made only for those homologues tested across both studies thereby including only pfhxa pfhpa pfoa pfna pfda pfunda pfdoda pfhxs pfos and pfds the average surface soil concentrations for pfoa ranged from 3 7 to 32 µg kg and measured median max concentrations for pfoa and pfos equaled 16 and 69 µg kg respectively these max soil concentrations are 5x higher than those reported in background soils from soil surveys brusseau et al 2020 finally considering nondetectable pfas homologues n 12 in soils collected from the station s irrigation ditch representing soils with no historic application of biosolids these findings suggest the presence of pfas in surface soils on the farm 0 30 cm bgs are associated with the historical land application of biosolids 3 2 pfas in soil profile results of pfas concentrations measured in soils representing the 30 60 cm bgs profile yielded 96 to 100 detection frequency detection frequencies in the 60 90 cm soil profile equal 83 94 with nondetectable nd concentrations of pfds and pfdoda found in the 60 90 cm profile for several soil samples at all substations additionally four out of 20 soil samples collected at ss3 had nd concentrations of pfbs these results suggest multiple pfas have vertically migrated through the soil profile at the station figure 2 overall the results show preferential leaching of short chain pfas compounds through the soil profile as can be seen in figure 2 inset and as has been previously reported in the literature e g washington et al 2010 baduel et al 2017 as discussed by the national research council nrc 2002 long term land application of biosolids may cause soil ph changes in this study soil ph ranged from 5 2 to 7 6 in the 0 30 cm soil layer and increased with depth see table 2 ranging from 6 9 to 9 6 in the 60 90 cm profile the suspected migration of pfas through the soil profile is possibly related to the measured increasing soil ph through that profile as sorption of pfas compounds have been shown to decrease with increasing ph arvaniti et al 2014 du et al 2014 specifically pfas variable sorption behavior with soil ph especially in the presence of ca 2 or mg 2 in water du et al 2014 may be associated with electrostatic interactions between pfas anions and positively charged surfaces of natural geomaterials such as metal oxide surfaces found in soils zareitalabad et al 2013 additionally while the overall sorption behavior of pfas is commonly reported to be dominantly associated with hydrophobic interactions onto organic matter of adsorbents higgins and luthy 2006 jeon et al 2013 the electrostatic surface potential of organic matter is a function of soil ph higgins and luthy 2007 jeon et al 2013 du et al 2014 pfas soil concentrations measured in core samples collected during well installation at the station suggest that pfoa and pfos have migrated through the surface soil profile to deeper soils of the vadose zone fig 3 quantifiable soil concentrations of pfoa were detected up to approximately 9 m bgs and up to 3 m bgs for pfos at the station with both pfoa and pfos detected in deeper soils up to 18 m bgs measured concentrations of pfoa in groundwater located approximately 17 m bgs were reported 0 029 µg l pfos in groundwater 0 002 µg l researchers have shown soil concentrations of pfas compounds are commonly detected at higher concentrations than corresponding soil pore waters with soil serving as a significant long term reservoir for pfas in the environment e g rankin et al 2016 brusseau 2018 has qualified multiple mechanisms potentially impacting the overall transport and fate behavior of pfoa and pfos through natural geomedia including air water partitioning and air water interfacial adsorption these phenomena commonly associated with pfas in the vadose zone contribute to long term sources of pfas to groundwater weber et al 2017 brusseau 2018 2019 3 3 pfas and biosolids loadings the highest total pfas soil concentrations including 12pfas 8pfca and 4pfsa were measured in surface soils collected from substations having the largest long term average biosolids loading rates as shown in table 3 linear regression results r2 0 97 indicate statistically significant linear correlations p value 0 005 between measured 12pfas 8pfca and 4pfsa and the respective long term historical cumulative biosolids loading rates similarly statistically significant linear correlations between max soil concentrations of all twelve pfas r2 0 96 were also found similar linear relationships have been reported linking pfas soil concentrations to biosolids loadings washington et al 2010 sepulvado et al 2011 a comparison of the slopes describing this linear relationship for long chain c7 versus short chain compounds shows an order of magnitude increase in the slope for long chain average slope 0 02 versus short chain average slope 0 003 homologues these results suggest that long chain pfas compounds tend to be more bioaccumulative and environmentally persistent than short as previously reported in the literature washington et al 2010 buck et al 2011 sepulvado et al 2011 in this study pfas concentrations in the station s historical land applied biosolids beginning in the mid 1990s were not characterized as is commonly the case in these agricultural field studies without that historical record the impact of the temporal and seasonal variation of pfas expected in applied sewage sludge albeit significant cannot be qualified analysis of sludges collected in 2001 as part of the usepa targeted national sewage sludge survey nsss usepa 2009 reports select pfas concentrations in us sludges venkatesan and halden 2013 combining the reported biosolids loadings for substations in this study with those reported average max and min concentrations for pfas tested across both studies n 11 pfas mass kg in surface soils 0 30 cm bgs were predicted and compared to those measured while the nsss average pfas concentrations underpredict the total mass of pfas measured in surface soils in this study by approximately 40 the max pfas concentrations effectively predict the measured total mass fig 4 it may be of interest to note that average pfas concentrations in sludges collected in the pacific northwest schultz et al 2005 and sludges collected in the western us higgins et al 2005 underpredict pfas total mass measured in this study by 70 while these results suggest that pfas concentrations characterized as part of usepa s nsss may be a predictive tool to estimate pfas in surface soils it is important to consider the significant impact of waste stream sources to pfas concentrations in wastewater treatment plant sludges 4 conclusions the concentrations of twelve pfas homologues were measured in surface soils deeper soils and in groundwater from agricultural fields following many years of repeated biosolids loadings measured soil concentrations were 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than pfas levels in global background soils with nondetectable levels of all twelve pfas homologues in soils collected from the station s irrigation ditch to which no biosolids were historically applied the contribution of pfas from treated wastewater appears negligible pfas soil levels were significantly correlated with respective biosolids loading rates at sampled substations independent of the time since last application of the planting and feedcrop harvesting and of the overall pattern of historical biosolids application these findings suggest a significant bioaccumulative and recalcitrant transport and fate behavior for pfas in our environment the observed distribution of multiple pfas through the near surface soil profile indicates preferential leaching of short chain pfas both pfos and pfoa were measured at quantifiable levels in the deeper soils of the vadose zone and in the immediately underlying groundwater located 17 m below ground with measured groundwater concentrations 1 to 2 orders of magnitude less than soil concentrations the significant role of retention processes in soil systems contributing to pfas overall transport and fate behavior in the subsurface is evident as well is the impact to overall soil quality as the first known study to characterize pfas in surface soils to deeper soils of the vadose zone and to immediately underlying groundwater following long term application of biosolids it is clear and prudent that additional efforts are needed to characterize the risk of land applying biosolids with reported emerging pollutants as they impact our soil
