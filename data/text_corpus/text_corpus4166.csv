20830,to promote energy extraction efficiency an active deformation method to implant an elastic airbag at the leading edge of flapping wings is proposed in this study the charging and discharging processes of the airbag are accomplished by sinusoidally adjusting the local deformation angle we investigated numerically the effect of both the reduced frequency f and the local deformation amplitude α on the energy extraction efficiency with the chord based reynolds number r e c 5 1 0 5 our results show that as the reduced frequency f increases the energy extraction efficiency of flapping wings with various local deformation α first rises and then drops with a maximum energy efficiency around 0 4 energy extraction efficiency via local deformation of the leading edge can be enhanced up to 25 compared with the non deformed flapping wing in the lower reduced frequency range analysis on flow field and the working coefficients indicates due to the airbag deformation the leading edge vortex is more closely attached to the suction side of the flapping wing with larger local deformation elastic airbag α 20 and 25 inducing more preferable pressure distribution and higher

however the consumption of resources such as coal and petrol has a considerable and negative effect on the environment and human well being as an alternative the utilization and exploitation of renewable energy has become a worldwide concern in recent decades among types of various existing renewable energy converters flapping wings inspired by the bionic propulsion of fish and birds attracted a huge deal of researchers attention the flapping wing energy extraction mode is eco friendly with low noise friendly working conditions and easy application using the flapping wings for energy extraction and propulsion in uniform flow received a lot of attention and has achieved great progress since it was proposed initially and experimentally studied by mckinney and delaurier 1981 based on actuation mechanism namely the forced motion systems the semi passive systems and the fully passive ones or self sustained systems for the first type the motion of the flapping wing are prescribed for the second part of the motions mostly the pitch motion are forced while other motions result from the fluid structure interaction the self sustained type means however the motions of the systems to harvest energy rely on purely the flow induced instability xiao and zhu 2014 the heaving force has a major influence on the energy extraction efficiency and it is determined by the relative motion of the structure and the working fluid so far most research on the flapping wing energy harvester focused on how the motion parameters affect the heaving force and the energy efficiency these parameters include the flapping or oscillatory frequency kinsey et al 2011 zhu 2011 lu et al 2015 ma et al 2017 heave and pitch motion amplitude phase difference and motion trajectories ashraf et al 2011 xiao et al 2012 xu et al 2016 wu et al 2016 and flapping wing actuation modes zhu 2012 deng et al 2015 wu et al 2016 zhu and tian 2017 jiang et al 2017 zhan et al 2017 wang et al 2017 ma et al 2018 the listed literature above were carried out on rigid or undeformed wings enriching knowledge on better performance of flapping wing energy converters on the other hand researchers found that heaving force could also be increased by flying creatures such as birds able to actively change the shape of wings during flight inspired by that there are studies on applying this kind of active wing deformation to flapping wing energy extraction yang et al 2012 investigated the impacts of flexible deformation spanwise deformation and chord deformation on the aerodynamic performance of flapping wings the findings showed that spanwise and chord deformation in a small range could enhance the aerodynamic performance of the flapping wing under the condition of large chord length based reynolds number r e c c u ν 1 0 6 c being the chord length u the free stream velocity ν the fluid viscosity liu et al 2013 2016 studied the influence of the local deformation of the leading edge and trailing edge of the flapping wing on the flapping wing energy extraction characteristics the numerical results showed that the local deformation of the flapping wing was able to enhance the heave force and keep it in good synchronization with the heave motion thereby improving the energy efficiency of flapping wings the energy extraction efficiency of a deformable flapping wing naca0012 in two dimensional and three dimensional cases were investigated by le and ko 2015 they mainly focused on the effect of the deformation of the medial camber line it was found that the deformed flapping wings extended the scale of the leading edge vortex and the moving range of the leading edge vortex under the airfoil surface moreover regarding the pressure distribution it improved the relative pressure difference between the lower and upper airfoil surface thus enhanced the heave force as well as the energy extraction efficiency hoke et al 2015 conducted studies regarding the energy extraction features of the circular arc deformation on naca0012 airfoil at r e c 1000 and reduced frequency f f c u 0 14 where f is the oscillatory frequency by setting the phase angle of deformation at 135 the maximum energy extraction efficiency was obtained as 37 9 the improved energy efficiency was caused by the interaction between the trailing edge vortex and the leading edge vortex jeanmonod and olivier 2017 investigated the parameters of naca airfoil flapping wings with thickness over chord length ratio of 1 three deformation modes were assessed including uniform deformation deformation at the leading edge of the airfoil and deformation at the trailing edge the results were compared with the results of the rigid airfoil under the same conditions and it was concluded that the deformed wings can obtain the efficiency more than twice the corresponding rigid airfoil totpal et al 2018 studied the effect of pitch amplitude θ 0 and pitch motion phase angle ϕ on the energy extraction efficiency of rigid flapping wings as well as leading edge partially deformed flapping wings it turned out that there was an increase in the heave force of flapping wing in a small part of the whole cycle which could be clarified by the fact that the deformation at the leading edge resulted in the delay of the leading edge vortex shedding auxiliary structures can also be used to improve the energy extraction performance of flapping wings numerical studies were conducted by wu et al 2015 2016 on the flexible tail flap utilizing an immersed boundary lattice boltzmann technique they found that compared to the traditional naca0015 airfoil the deformable trailing edge improved the amplitude of lifting force thus resulting in a higher energy extraction efficiency they also studied the effect of the weight of the deformable trailing edge on the amplitude of heaving forces liu et al 2017 applied the lattice boltzmann method lbm to conduct a numerical investigation on the energy extraction efficiency of the naca0015 airfoil with a flat plate at the trailing edge they studied the effect of reduced frequency f 0 04 0 24 and pitching amplitude θ 0 40 90 on the energy extraction efficiency the results showed that the maximum energy extraction efficiency could be increased by 7 24 by the mass density of the trailing edge flat plate of 0 6 and the resonance frequency of 1 18 more recently lin and wu 2019 numerically studied the effects of three various modes of non uniform flexibility distribution piecewise distribution linear distribution and heterocercal distribution on the flapping wing energy extraction performance results indicated that by decreasing the flexibility along the length the tail is beneficial to enhance energy efficiency the reason is that the non uniform flexible tail can create larger bending deformation compared to the uniform one which is conducive for capturing the leading edge vortex and results in a significant increase of lift also zhu et al 2019a performed studied in this regard they investigated the effects of the trailing edge leading edge and overall circular arc deformations on the power extraction efficiencies their results indicated that the power extraction performance was improved by leading edge deformation in the low frequency region while trailing edge deformation enhances the performance in the high frequency region in total the circular arc deformation as a superposition of the trailing and leading edge deformations had the greatest improvement on power extraction efficiency and it greatly extended the frequency range with high efficiency they also studied the underlying physics regarding the fact that the energy extraction efficiency could be enhanced by active synchronous deformation in the arc length of an airfoil employed in a flapping wing zhu et al 2019b in summary there are two types of airfoil or wing deformation including the deformation of the wing itself partially or entirely and auxiliary structures at the leading or trailing edge the ultimate objective of these deformations is to enhance the heave force of the flapping wing and thus enlarge the energy extraction capacity previous studies indicated that the generation of the heave force and the leading edge vortex significantly affect the energy extraction efficiency of the flapping wings specifically the leading edge vortex shedding process determined the energy efficiency level by alternating the local surface pressure distribution of the flapping wing xiao and zhu 2014 kinsey and dumas 2012 in this work we propose a method by implanting an elastic airbag at the leading edge of the flapping wing to improve the leading edge vortex shedding characteristics and thus to enhance the energy extraction efficiency the deformation control of the elastic airbag and the motion of the flapping wing with the elastic airbag are specified in section 2 afterwards the numerical method is introduced in section 3 numerical results concerning the energy efficiency improvement together with analysis on the working coefficients and flow characteristics of the flapping wings with various local elastic airbag deformation amplitudes are presented in section 4 a conclusion part is made in section 5 2 deformation control of the elastic airbag and motion of the flapping wing based on the studies on the energy extraction of flapping wings in literature it is found that the heave force of flapping wing is the main cause of its energy extraction from the environment by improving the heave force and making it synchronized with the motion pattern of the flapping wing the energy extraction efficiency of the flapping wing will be improved specially xiao and zhu 2014 kinsey and dumas 2012 and zhu et al 2019a demonstrated that the leading edge vortex shedding can alternate local surface pressure distribution and thus improve the heave force and energy extraction efficiency of flapping wings inspired by the previous related works we propose to implant an elastic airbag at the leading edge as shown in fig 1 to control the vortex shedding patterns around the wing and also the energy efficiency the elastic airbag mainly includes rectification structure a c or a c and expansion structure b c or b c the expansion structure can be deflated based on the flapping motion of the airfoil and the main parameters controlling the local deformation are shown in fig 1 a during local deformation of the airbag the rectifying structure made of a rigid material begin to work driving line segment a c to rotate around point a to form a new segment a c the airbag is then expanded and a circular arc b c will be formed as illustrated the leading edge airbag surface consists of the line segment a c the arc b c tangential to a c and their symmetric counterparts and they are marked with red solid line the original naca0015 surface replaced is marked with black dotted lines as shown in fig 1 a to determine the position of the line segment a c and arc b c in a certain instant the calculation process is given as follows to ensure the circular arc tangent to the line segment at point c is the main constraint condition for the arc b c and line segment a c as shown in fig 1 α represents the angle between the line segment a c and a c the value of α shows the level of local deformation of the leading edge the pitching center coordinate is set as p 0 0 point a x a y a b x b y b c x c y c are control points located on the original wing for calculation we suppose that the line segment a c does not elastically deform indicating that the length is constant a c x a x c 2 y a y c 2 when point c rotates around point a to point c the position c x c y c can be determined based on the trigonometric function relationship as x a a c cos α t y a a c sin α t then by solving the trajectory of the circle tangent to a c and passing through point b the leading edge local deformation circular arc profile can be determined assuming o a b as the center of the circular arc and the radius of the arc is r the slope of the straight line passing through o c is k 1 and the slope of the straight line passing through a c is k 2 the trajectory of the circle tangent to a c and passing through point b can be denoted as following 1 k 1 k 2 1 x b a 2 y b b 2 r 2 x c a 2 y c b 2 r 2 we can obtain the values of a b r and also the trajectory of b c by solving the above equations aside from the deformation control of the elastic airbag introduced above the proposed flapping wing energy harvester device is a combination of both heaving motions and periodic pitching as shown in fig 1 b the pitching axis x p is located at 1 3 of the chord length c from the leading edge the airfoil motions i e the time varying displacement in the vertical direction h t and pitch angle θ t together with the local deformation α t of the airbag can be formulated as following 2a h t h 0 sin 2 π f t ϕ 2b θ t θ 0 sin 2 π f t 2c α t α sin 2 π f t in which h 0 and θ 0 are amplitudes of heave and pitch motion respectively f is the motion frequency ϕ is the phase difference between the heave and the pitch motions and it is taken as ϕ π 2 so that the maximum energy extraction efficiency can be achieved xiao and zhu 2014 the elastic airbag deformation α t here is set to be consistent with the pitching motion in phase term the flapping wing posture variation against the incoming flow in a flapping motion cycle is shown in fig 1 b it should noticed that there is only vertical motion of the pitching point p and the horizontal arrangement is merely employed for use of posture illustration at various motion phases φ and it does not mean streamwise motion at motion phase φ 0 the local deformation α is zero according to the motion control introduced above it should be noticed that the flapping wing with α 0 has a geometry profile that differs from the original naca0015 wing at the leading edge at motion phase φ π 4 the pressure or upper surface of the airbag at the leading edge is expanded while the counter part at the suction or lower surface keeps unchanged at motion phase φ π 2 the pitch motion θ and the leading edge deformation α reaches the maximum value and then decline sinusoidally to zero values at φ π as the head part is rotated upward the lower part of the airbag deforms and turns into the pressure surface instead the upper surface part turns into suction surface the motion and deformation of the flapping wing restores to the horizontal posture with φ 2 π or 0 the above describes the motion and deformation in a complete cycle the heave velocity v y t 2 π f h 0 cos 2 π f t ϕ and pitch angular velocity ω t 2 π f θ 0 cos 2 π f t can be easily obtained thereafter the total power extracted from the flow according to the motions v y t and ω t of the flapping wing can be written as 3a p y t f y t v y t 3b p θ t m θ t ω t in eq 3 f y t and m θ t are lift force in heave direction and the pitching torque about the rotation center the energy extraction coefficients due to the heave and the pitch motion can be denoted as c p y and c p θ as a result the average non dimensional power extraction efficient over a cycle period t denoted as c p can be combined as the summation of contributions from the pitching and the heaving parts as 4 c p c p y c p θ 0 1 c y t v y t u c m t ω t c u d t t where c y f y t 0 5 ρ c u 2 and c m m θ t 0 5 ρ c 2 u 2 the power extraction efficiency for an oscillating airfoil is determined as the ratio of c p to the total incoming power of the working fluid within the swept area over t as 5 η c p c d in which d is the maximum vertical extent swept by the flapping wing as illustrated in fig 1 3 numerical methods the numerical method used in this work is similar to that employed in zhu et al 2019a and a brief description is introduced here the numerical computation was carried out using ansys fluent a two dimensional 2d 70 c 85 c rectangular computational domain was constructed and discretized with a finite volume method as shown in fig 2 the airfoil was modeled as a naca0015 airfoil and a chord based r e c u c ν value of 5 1 0 5 was chosen a relative reference frame with the coordinate origin position attached at the pitching point p of the foil was employed the velocities at the inlet boundary will be adjusted according to the heave velocity accordingly as a result the wing would only undergo pitching motion in the above reference coordinate a circular zone with a diameter of 10 c was set to be a rotating area to facilitate the pitching motion and the boundary was set to be a sliding mesh interface the inlet boundaries at the top the left and the bottom of the domain were prescribed with time varying velocities while the outlet boundary at the right end had a fixed pressure the velocities at the inlet boundaries took into the account of the heave motion of the flapping wing the added source term and revised inlet velocity boundary conditions were defined with the user defined functions udfs here we adopted the mesh and time step configurations i e totally 80000 elements and 4000 time steps per motion cycle and spalart allmaras s a turbulence model recommended by previous researchers zhu et al 2019a kinsey and dumas 2012 more details can be founded therein in this work kinsey s 2d computational and experimental results kinsey et al 2011 kinsey and dumas 2012 were selected to validate the accuracy of current numerical study specifically the test case employed original naca0015 surface profile and the flapping wing motion was conducted with following parameters r e c 5 1 0 5 h 0 c 1 x p c 1 3 θ 0 75 corresponding energy extraction efficiency factors were compared with the reference studies as presented in fig 3 a favorable agreement supporting the feasibility of the proposed simulation technique for the subsequent research is found between the numerical results and the reference study to investigate on how the elastic airbag deformation affect the energy extraction efficiency in this research in the following study we choose airbag configuration with x a 0 25 c and x c 0 05 c as shown in fig 1 a and the local deformation angle amplitude is set to be α 0 15 20 25 4 results and discussion 4 1 energy extraction performance of flapping wing with the active deformation airbag the energy extraction efficiency η of the proposed flapping wing with various local deformation angle amplitude α are shown in fig 4 the horizontal axis is the reduced frequency f f c u for all cases the following configuration is adopted as r e c 5 1 0 5 h 0 c 1 x p c 1 3 θ 0 75 x a 0 25 c x c 0 05 c the results show that with increase of the reduced frequency f the energy extraction efficiency of the flapping wing at various deformation angle α first increases and then decreases with a maximum efficiency η around 0 4 compared with the efficiency curve of the flapping wing with original naca0015 surface profile in the lower frequency range f 0 12 the energy extraction efficiency η is considerably improved for cases with the leading edge deformation amplitude of α 20 25 for example at f 0 10 η has an enhancement of 17 3 and 25 8 for α 20 and 25 respectively also comparable improvement of η by respectively 15 6 and 25 9 also holds at f 0 08 on the other hand in reduced frequency range f 0 12 0 20 the maximum efficiency fails to be improved through the deformable wing configuration applied in this study especially when the deformation angle α equals to 0 or 15 to be short the leading edge active airbag deformation method is capable of extending the reduced frequency coverage where optimal energy extraction performance can be delivered 4 2 working coefficients of the flapping wing to comprehend the performance improvement in the energy extraction efficiency corresponding to the four various deformation angles α of the local elastic airbag in the following we will analyze the corresponding working coefficients as introduced in section 2 the cases with reduced frequency f fixed at 0 1 and 0 14 were selected to be studied considering the fact that the energy efficiency naturally converges to a maximum level as the deformation angle α increases as has been shown in fig 4 fig 5 illustrates the variations of the heave force the pitch torque and their working coefficients in a cycle for four various deformation angles at f 0 1 it is observed that there is a significant difference in the amplitude of the heave forces for the four leading edge local deformation flapping wings especially around the position where t t is equal to 0 25 and 0 75 the maximum gap of the airbag is attained there is also the largest heave force amplitude of the leading edge local deformation flapping wing with α 25 also the heave force directions of the four cases can match well with the heave motion i e v y t direction hence the heave force generally does positive work in one motion cycle the heave force of the flapping wing in the case of α 25 performs the best by doing the most work the amplitudes of the pitch torques for these force flapping wings are close to each other in most time and the pitch torque sometimes does negative work in a cycle due to the anti phase relation between the torque and the pitch motion i e ω t around the time instant of t t 0 425 and t t 0 925 the peak values are obtained for the pitch torque for four cases it can be noticed that the pitch angular velocity ω t and the pitch torque are temporarily in phase resulting in positive power extraction at this moment the pitch torque for the leading edge local deformation flapping wing possesses the highest positive peak value when α equals to 25 as can be seen in fig 5 d for reduced frequency f 0 14 the working coefficients of the flapping wing are shown in fig 6 the heave force coefficient c y for larger local deformation angles α 20 25 are quite similar and varying smoothly with time however for smaller local deformation angles c y has drastic variations around t t 0 5 or 1 0 especially for case with α 15 as a result the power coefficient c p y has a local amplification for flapping wings with smaller deformation angles there is a deficiency of c p y for α 15 compared to other cases but this is compromised by higher power coefficient c p θ around t t 0 5 contributed by the rotational movement as can be seen in fig 6 c d another matter of fact can be found is that despite the amplitude difference flapping wings with α 15 and 0 have similar variation pattern of both c y and c m meanwhile the same statement can be made to cases with α 20 and 25 comparison of working coefficients for f 0 1 and 0 14 shows that the power coefficient c p y dominate over the pitching movement counterpart i e c p θ also as the reduced frequency increases from 0 1 to 0 14 the heave force induced power coefficient c p y amplitude peak increases from 1 75 to 2 5 for flapping wings with larger deformation angles α 20 25 but more importantly the pitch motion induced c p θ in a complete motion cycle drops below zero for cases with higher reduced frequency when we refer to figs 5 d and 6 d it can be deduced that at higher reduced frequencies the torque force will produce more negative work against the pitching motion and consequently impair the improvement of the power efficiency although the heave force induced power coefficient improves compared with lower reduced frequency situations table 1 summarizes the working coefficients for the pitch torque and heave force at different deformation amplitude α with f 0 1 and 0 14 for cases with lower frequency f 0 1 the average power coefficient due to the heave motion c p y grows monotonically as α increases and it is significantly larger than power coefficient c p θ due to the pitch motion the latter c p θ holds positive in four cases and it is of larger values when α equal to 15 or 25 considering contributions form both the pitch and the heave motions the case with α 25 does most positive work hence it delivers the highest energy extraction efficiency for cases with f 0 14 the energy extraction due to heave motion has been improved compared with cases with f 0 1 but the pitch motion will do more negative work as a result the energy extraction efficiency η locates close to 0 4 for flapping wings with f 0 14 and it should be noticed that with α 15 the energy harvested by heave motion is lower than the other 3 cases but the negative due to the pitching motion is also of lower magnitude another fact about the design of local active airbag deformation at the leading edge is with higher deformation angle α 25 higher energy extraction η 0 391 at lower reduced frequency reaches comparable magnitudes with those at f 0 14 which extends the optimal working conditions or reduced frequency significantly for flapping wing energy converters for even higher reduced frequencies e g f 0 14 it is speculated that the pitch force will produce more negative work and reduce the energy extraction further as we can see in fig 4 especially for flapping wings with smaller deformation amplitude α 4 3 analysis on flow characteristics as can be seen from the above section there is an obvious difference between the heave force and the pitch torque at t t 0 25 and 0 425 or t t 0 75 and 0 925 for the cases of local deformation flapping wing with lower reduced frequency f 0 1 and also at t t 0 5 or t t 1 0 for cases with f 0 14 with the surface pressure distribution and analysis on the flow field characteristics around the flapping wing we will continue to analyze the contribution of the pitch torque and heave force to the energy extraction of the flapping wings in the following part and it will help to understand the underlying mechanism of the energy efficiency improvement by the leading edge airbag deformation design proposed in this study for flapping wing cases with f 0 1 fig 7 presents the vortex structures and the pressure distributions for various deformation angle at t t 0 25 it is observed in fig 7 a that the rigid foil without deformation α 0 has a large scale of shedding vortex phenomenon at the trailing and the leading edges this type of early separation of the leading edge vortex is not effective to obtain a high lift force for the flapping wing if α is equal to 15 we can also find the shedding vortex structures however the separation of shedding vortex from the trailing edge is relatively weak and the leading edge shedding vortex is more attached on the flapping wing s lower surface when α is equal to 20 and 25 there is no obvious shedding vortex structures the vortices created from the leading edge is closely attached to the lower surface it contributes to improving the lift force regarding the streamline we can find out that the flow conforms well to the flapping wings geometry by increasing the value of α this helps delay the separation of the flow from the surface thus we can obtain a relatively high value of lift force for the flapping wings the pressure distributions around the flapping wing are presented in fig 7 b and the surface pressure c p s c p s p s p p 0 5 ρ u 2 p s is surface pressure are also extracted and shown in fig 8 the pressure difference in the vertical direction in above figures is an indication for the magnitude of the heave force at the time instant of t t 0 25 the positive pressure distribution on the upper surface of the four various deformation angles is nearly the same and a lower level of negative pressure exists on the lower surface of the flapping wing when the deformation amplitude α is 20 or 25 thus a larger pressure difference or heave force can be obtained between the upper and lower surfaces the reason for such phenomenon is that owing to the local deformation in the upward direction of the leading edge during the downward movement of the flapping wing the velocity of the flow around the lower surface is accelerated while the velocity of the flow near the upper surface of the wing is slowed down as a result the pressure at the upper surface of the wing increases however it decreases at the lower surface the heave forces for deformation amplitude of α 0 and 15 are less compared to that of α 20 or 25 the above content mainly analyzed how the deformation angles of the leading edge local deformation flapping wings affect the heave force at t t 0 25 in the following we focused on time instant t t 0 425 to focus on the pitch motion movement fig 9 represents the vortex and pressure distributions for four various deformation angles of the flapping wing in fig 9 a we can readily notice obvious shedding vortex structures at the trailing edge for all cases the shedding vortex for α 0 has the largest scale and it is located far away from the trailing edge nevertheless when α varies between 15 25 the detached leading edge vortices are located closely under the lower surface of the trailing edge it should be noticed that at t t 0 425 the flapping wing is about to return to the horizontal posture and rotate clockwise around the pitch center consequently the shedding vortex structures will be absorbed and be attached to the lower surface of the trailing edge again hence the formation of a local low pressure region induces the positive work of the pitch motion in figs 9 b and 10 it is observed that in these four cases with increase of the deformation angle α the pressure on the upper surface pressure surface of the flapping wing s trailing edge increases gradually while the pressure on the lower surface suction surface of the trailing edge first increases and then decreases for α 0 there is noticeably a low pressure area on the lower and the upper surfaces of the trailing edge of the airfoil as shown in fig 9 b when α is 20 high pressure is distributed on the lower and the upper surfaces of the trailing edge of the airfoil these pressure distribution scenarios are not conducive to completing the airfoil clockwise pitch movement however when α 15 and α 25 the region above the trailing edge of the airfoil turns to high pressure area while region below the trailing edge is of low pressure which is more significantly for case with α 25 hence a large pressure difference exists between the lower and upper surfaces of the trailing edge of the airfoil this pressure distribution creates a clockwise torque to help the airfoil to complete the clockwise pitching motion this is the reason why pitching torque over the system at α 15 and α 25 does more positive work to the flapping wing compared to the case with α 20 as has been illustrated in table 1 with bold formatting and also fig 5 c d for flapping wing cases with f 0 14 the flow structures and patterns at t t 0 5 for α 0 and 15 are quite different from those of α 20 and 25 for the former vortices of both large and small scales shed around the rotation center a of the elastic airbag at the lower side of the flapping wing inducing more oscillatory variation of working coefficients c y and c m illustrated in fig 6 for cases with larger deformation angle α there is only one shedding vortex under the flapping wing thus leading to more smooth variation of the working coefficients in fig 6 in figs 11 b and 12 the pressure distributions at t t 0 5 for four cases have large areas of negative pressure at both the upper and the lower surfaces the resultant heave force coefficient c y for flapping wings with α 0 and 15 falls close to zero on the other hand there is positive heave force coefficient c y for flapping wings with α 20 and 25 due to larger negative pressure distribution at the upper surface in fig 12 under the same axis scale with figs 8 and 10 the upper side pressure is of mostly negative distribution which is different from the situations with f 1 0 at the lower side large positive pressure at the trailing zone for α 20 and 25 will generate counter clockwise torque force that impairs the clockwise pitch motion the flapping will undergo as illustrated in fig 1 b at t t 0 5 also the power efficiency η will be reduced the local peak for power coefficient c p θ for flapping wing with α 15 as shown in fig 6 can be explained by the large negative pressure distribution at the trailing part of the lower surface which will result in considerable torque force that in phase with the pitching velocity ω as shown in fig 6 c this will reduce the negative work done to the pitch motion throughout the complete motion cycle nevertheless it has to be admitted that the pitch force does negative work for all flapping wings with different α at higher reduced frequency while it does positive work at lower reduced frequency as shown in table 1 to sum up in this section analysis focused on flow distribution and characteristics at representative time instants in the motion cycle for a flapping wing energy converter with active leading edge airbag deformation has been performed the time instants were selected according to figs 5 and 6 for f 0 1 and 0 14 respectively the results show that flapping wings with larger deformation angle α 20 25 have leading edge shedding vortices formed more closely at the suction side at lower reduced frequency f 0 1 and less shedding vortices near the trailing edge at higher reduced frequency f 0 14 as a result preferable surface pressure distributions in such circumstances will promote energy extraction mainly contributed by the heave force contribution c p y with larger amplitude and less oscillation for the same reason it can be speculated that more negative work will be done by the torque force for higher reduced frequency larger than 0 14 and the flow around the wing become more unsteady especially for flapping wings with smaller deformation angle α 0 15 as a results decrease of energy extraction efficiency η has been observed in fig 4 5 conclusions in the present work to enhance energy extraction performance an active elastic airbag deformation at the leading edge is proposed for the flapping wing energy converters the charging and discharging processes of the airbag are accomplished by sinusoidally adjusting the local deformation angle with the chord length based reynolds number r e c at 5 1 0 5 we investigated numerically the effect of the local deformation amplitude α and the reduced frequency f on the energy extraction efficiency η of the flapping wing analysis on the working coefficients and flow characteristics around the wing structure was performed to understand the underlying mechanism of the energy efficiency improvement our results show that 1 the energy extraction efficiency η for different airbag deformation amplitude α first increases and then decreases with a maximum value around 0 40 as the reduce frequency f increases compared with flapping wings with undeformed wing profile the energy extraction efficiency at lower reduced frequency f 0 12 can be increased by up to 25 with larger deformation angle amplitudes i e α 20 and 25 the proposed leading edge local deformation flapping wing with α 20 and 25 can attain optimal energy extraction efficiency with a considerably expanded reduced frequency range compared with flapping wing of undeformed profile 2 for flapping wings with lower reduced frequency i e f 0 1 at t t 0 25 when α is equal to 20 and 25 the leading edge shedding vortices of the flapping wing are more closely attached to the flapping wing s lower surface thus contributing to the improvement of lift force and also the energy extraction efficiency at t t 0 425 the flapping wing is about to return to the horizontal posture and rotates clockwise around the pitch center the shedding vortex structures will be adsorbed and attached to the trailing edge s lower surface again forming a local low pressure region which enhances the positive work due to the pitch motion 3 for flapping wings with higher reduced frequency i e f 0 14 at t t 0 5 the optical energy extraction is obtained for all flapping wings with four local active deformation amplitudes compared with cases of f 0 1 the heave motion contribution is significantly larger while the pitch motion contrarily does negative work the flow analysis shows that larger heave force is induced by the larger negative pressure zone at the upper side of the wing while large negative torque force is a result of the positive pressure zone at the trailing part of the lower surface 4 altogether flapping wings with larger local deformation amplitudes α 20 and 25 have leading edge vortices more closely attached to the suction side at lower reduced frequency f 0 1 and less shedding vortices at the suction side at higher reduced frequency f 0 14 as a result energy extraction with larger amplitude and less oscillation will be delivered it is speculated that more negative work will be done by the torque force for even higher reduced frequency and the flow around the wing become more unsteady especially for flapping wings with smaller deformation amplitudes α 0 and 15 credit authorship contribution statement xiao dong bai

20830,to promote energy extraction efficiency an active deformation method to implant an elastic airbag at the leading edge of flapping wings is proposed in this study the charging and discharging processes of the airbag are accomplished by sinusoidally adjusting the local deformation angle we investigated numerically the effect of both the reduced frequency f and the local deformation amplitude α on the energy extraction efficiency with the chord based reynolds number r e c 5 1 0 5 our results show that as the reduced frequency f increases the energy extraction efficiency of flapping wings with various local deformation α first rises and then drops with a maximum energy efficiency around 0 4 energy extraction efficiency via local deformation of the leading edge can be enhanced up to 25 compared with the non deformed flapping wing in the lower reduced frequency range analysis on flow field and the working coefficients indicates due to the airbag deformation the leading edge vortex is more closely attached to the suction side of the flapping wing with larger local deformation elastic airbag α 20 and 25 inducing more preferable pressure distribution and higher

however the consumption of resources such as coal and petrol has a considerable and negative effect on the environment and human well being as an alternative the utilization and exploitation of renewable energy has become a worldwide concern in recent decades among types of various existing renewable energy converters flapping wings inspired by the bionic propulsion of fish and birds attracted a huge deal of researchers attention the flapping wing energy extraction mode is eco friendly with low noise friendly working conditions and easy application using the flapping wings for energy extraction and propulsion in uniform flow received a lot of attention and has achieved great progress since it was proposed initially and experimentally studied by mckinney and delaurier 1981 based on actuation mechanism namely the forced motion systems the semi passive systems and the fully passive ones or self sustained systems for the first type the motion of the flapping wing are prescribed for the second part of the motions mostly the pitch motion are forced while other motions result from the fluid structure interaction the self sustained type means however the motions of the systems to harvest energy rely on purely the flow induced instability xiao and zhu 2014 the heaving force has a major influence on the energy extraction efficiency and it is determined by the relative motion of the structure and the working fluid so far most research on the flapping wing energy harvester focused on how the motion parameters affect the heaving force and the energy efficiency these parameters include the flapping or oscillatory frequency kinsey et al 2011 zhu 2011 lu et al 2015 ma et al 2017 heave and pitch motion amplitude phase difference and motion trajectories ashraf et al 2011 xiao et al 2012 xu et al 2016 wu et al 2016 and flapping wing actuation modes zhu 2012 deng et al 2015 wu et al 2016 zhu and tian 2017 jiang et al 2017 zhan et al 2017 wang et al 2017 ma et al 2018 the listed literature above were carried out on rigid or undeformed wings enriching knowledge on better performance of flapping wing energy converters on the other hand researchers found that heaving force could also be increased by flying creatures such as birds able to actively change the shape of wings during flight inspired by that there are studies on applying this kind of active wing deformation to flapping wing energy extraction yang et al 2012 investigated the impacts of flexible deformation spanwise deformation and chord deformation on the aerodynamic performance of flapping wings the findings showed that spanwise and chord deformation in a small range could enhance the aerodynamic performance of the flapping wing under the condition of large chord length based reynolds number r e c c u ν 1 0 6 c being the chord length u the free stream velocity ν the fluid viscosity liu et al 2013 2016 studied the influence of the local deformation of the leading edge and trailing edge of the flapping wing on the flapping wing energy extraction characteristics the numerical results showed that the local deformation of the flapping wing was able to enhance the heave force and keep it in good synchronization with the heave motion thereby improving the energy efficiency of flapping wings the energy extraction efficiency of a deformable flapping wing naca0012 in two dimensional and three dimensional cases were investigated by le and ko 2015 they mainly focused on the effect of the deformation of the medial camber line it was found that the deformed flapping wings extended the scale of the leading edge vortex and the moving range of the leading edge vortex under the airfoil surface moreover regarding the pressure distribution it improved the relative pressure difference between the lower and upper airfoil surface thus enhanced the heave force as well as the energy extraction efficiency hoke et al 2015 conducted studies regarding the energy extraction features of the circular arc deformation on naca0012 airfoil at r e c 1000 and reduced frequency f f c u 0 14 where f is the oscillatory frequency by setting the phase angle of deformation at 135 the maximum energy extraction efficiency was obtained as 37 9 the improved energy efficiency was caused by the interaction between the trailing edge vortex and the leading edge vortex jeanmonod and olivier 2017 investigated the parameters of naca airfoil flapping wings with thickness over chord length ratio of 1 three deformation modes were assessed including uniform deformation deformation at the leading edge of the airfoil and deformation at the trailing edge the results were compared with the results of the rigid airfoil under the same conditions and it was concluded that the deformed wings can obtain the efficiency more than twice the corresponding rigid airfoil totpal et al 2018 studied the effect of pitch amplitude θ 0 and pitch motion phase angle ϕ on the energy extraction efficiency of rigid flapping wings as well as leading edge partially deformed flapping wings it turned out that there was an increase in the heave force of flapping wing in a small part of the whole cycle which could be clarified by the fact that the deformation at the leading edge resulted in the delay of the leading edge vortex shedding auxiliary structures can also be used to improve the energy extraction performance of flapping wings numerical studies were conducted by wu et al 2015 2016 on the flexible tail flap utilizing an immersed boundary lattice boltzmann technique they found that compared to the traditional naca0015 airfoil the deformable trailing edge improved the amplitude of lifting force thus resulting in a higher energy extraction efficiency they also studied the effect of the weight of the deformable trailing edge on the amplitude of heaving forces liu et al 2017 applied the lattice boltzmann method lbm to conduct a numerical investigation on the energy extraction efficiency of the naca0015 airfoil with a flat plate at the trailing edge they studied the effect of reduced frequency f 0 04 0 24 and pitching amplitude θ 0 40 90 on the energy extraction efficiency the results showed that the maximum energy extraction efficiency could be increased by 7 24 by the mass density of the trailing edge flat plate of 0 6 and the resonance frequency of 1 18 more recently lin and wu 2019 numerically studied the effects of three various modes of non uniform flexibility distribution piecewise distribution linear distribution and heterocercal distribution on the flapping wing energy extraction performance results indicated that by decreasing the flexibility along the length the tail is beneficial to enhance energy efficiency the reason is that the non uniform flexible tail can create larger bending deformation compared to the uniform one which is conducive for capturing the leading edge vortex and results in a significant increase of lift also zhu et al 2019a performed studied in this regard they investigated the effects of the trailing edge leading edge and overall circular arc deformations on the power extraction efficiencies their results indicated that the power extraction performance was improved by leading edge deformation in the low frequency region while trailing edge deformation enhances the performance in the high frequency region in total the circular arc deformation as a superposition of the trailing and leading edge deformations had the greatest improvement on power extraction efficiency and it greatly extended the frequency range with high efficiency they also studied the underlying physics regarding the fact that the energy extraction efficiency could be enhanced by active synchronous deformation in the arc length of an airfoil employed in a flapping wing zhu et al 2019b in summary there are two types of airfoil or wing deformation including the deformation of the wing itself partially or entirely and auxiliary structures at the leading or trailing edge the ultimate objective of these deformations is to enhance the heave force of the flapping wing and thus enlarge the energy extraction capacity previous studies indicated that the generation of the heave force and the leading edge vortex significantly affect the energy extraction efficiency of the flapping wings specifically the leading edge vortex shedding process determined the energy efficiency level by alternating the local surface pressure distribution of the flapping wing xiao and zhu 2014 kinsey and dumas 2012 in this work we propose a method by implanting an elastic airbag at the leading edge of the flapping wing to improve the leading edge vortex shedding characteristics and thus to enhance the energy extraction efficiency the deformation control of the elastic airbag and the motion of the flapping wing with the elastic airbag are specified in section 2 afterwards the numerical method is introduced in section 3 numerical results concerning the energy efficiency improvement together with analysis on the working coefficients and flow characteristics of the flapping wings with various local elastic airbag deformation amplitudes are presented in section 4 a conclusion part is made in section 5 2 deformation control of the elastic airbag and motion of the flapping wing based on the studies on the energy extraction of flapping wings in literature it is found that the heave force of flapping wing is the main cause of its energy extraction from the environment by improving the heave force and making it synchronized with the motion pattern of the flapping wing the energy extraction efficiency of the flapping wing will be improved specially xiao and zhu 2014 kinsey and dumas 2012 and zhu et al 2019a demonstrated that the leading edge vortex shedding can alternate local surface pressure distribution and thus improve the heave force and energy extraction efficiency of flapping wings inspired by the previous related works we propose to implant an elastic airbag at the leading edge as shown in fig 1 to control the vortex shedding patterns around the wing and also the energy efficiency the elastic airbag mainly includes rectification structure a c or a c and expansion structure b c or b c the expansion structure can be deflated based on the flapping motion of the airfoil and the main parameters controlling the local deformation are shown in fig 1 a during local deformation of the airbag the rectifying structure made of a rigid material begin to work driving line segment a c to rotate around point a to form a new segment a c the airbag is then expanded and a circular arc b c will be formed as illustrated the leading edge airbag surface consists of the line segment a c the arc b c tangential to a c and their symmetric counterparts and they are marked with red solid line the original naca0015 surface replaced is marked with black dotted lines as shown in fig 1 a to determine the position of the line segment a c and arc b c in a certain instant the calculation process is given as follows to ensure the circular arc tangent to the line segment at point c is the main constraint condition for the arc b c and line segment a c as shown in fig 1 α represents the angle between the line segment a c and a c the value of α shows the level of local deformation of the leading edge the pitching center coordinate is set as p 0 0 point a x a y a b x b y b c x c y c are control points located on the original wing for calculation we suppose that the line segment a c does not elastically deform indicating that the length is constant a c x a x c 2 y a y c 2 when point c rotates around point a to point c the position c x c y c can be determined based on the trigonometric function relationship as x a a c cos α t y a a c sin α t then by solving the trajectory of the circle tangent to a c and passing through point b the leading edge local deformation circular arc profile can be determined assuming o a b as the center of the circular arc and the radius of the arc is r the slope of the straight line passing through o c is k 1 and the slope of the straight line passing through a c is k 2 the trajectory of the circle tangent to a c and passing through point b can be denoted as following 1 k 1 k 2 1 x b a 2 y b b 2 r 2 x c a 2 y c b 2 r 2 we can obtain the values of a b r and also the trajectory of b c by solving the above equations aside from the deformation control of the elastic airbag introduced above the proposed flapping wing energy harvester device is a combination of both heaving motions and periodic pitching as shown in fig 1 b the pitching axis x p is located at 1 3 of the chord length c from the leading edge the airfoil motions i e the time varying displacement in the vertical direction h t and pitch angle θ t together with the local deformation α t of the airbag can be formulated as following 2a h t h 0 sin 2 π f t ϕ 2b θ t θ 0 sin 2 π f t 2c α t α sin 2 π f t in which h 0 and θ 0 are amplitudes of heave and pitch motion respectively f is the motion frequency ϕ is the phase difference between the heave and the pitch motions and it is taken as ϕ π 2 so that the maximum energy extraction efficiency can be achieved xiao and zhu 2014 the elastic airbag deformation α t here is set to be consistent with the pitching motion in phase term the flapping wing posture variation against the incoming flow in a flapping motion cycle is shown in fig 1 b it should noticed that there is only vertical motion of the pitching point p and the horizontal arrangement is merely employed for use of posture illustration at various motion phases φ and it does not mean streamwise motion at motion phase φ 0 the local deformation α is zero according to the motion control introduced above it should be noticed that the flapping wing with α 0 has a geometry profile that differs from the original naca0015 wing at the leading edge at motion phase φ π 4 the pressure or upper surface of the airbag at the leading edge is expanded while the counter part at the suction or lower surface keeps unchanged at motion phase φ π 2 the pitch motion θ and the leading edge deformation α reaches the maximum value and then decline sinusoidally to zero values at φ π as the head part is rotated upward the lower part of the airbag deforms and turns into the pressure surface instead the upper surface part turns into suction surface the motion and deformation of the flapping wing restores to the horizontal posture with φ 2 π or 0 the above describes the motion and deformation in a complete cycle the heave velocity v y t 2 π f h 0 cos 2 π f t ϕ and pitch angular velocity ω t 2 π f θ 0 cos 2 π f t can be easily obtained thereafter the total power extracted from the flow according to the motions v y t and ω t of the flapping wing can be written as 3a p y t f y t v y t 3b p θ t m θ t ω t in eq 3 f y t and m θ t are lift force in heave direction and the pitching torque about the rotation center the energy extraction coefficients due to the heave and the pitch motion can be denoted as c p y and c p θ as a result the average non dimensional power extraction efficient over a cycle period t denoted as c p can be combined as the summation of contributions from the pitching and the heaving parts as 4 c p c p y c p θ 0 1 c y t v y t u c m t ω t c u d t t where c y f y t 0 5 ρ c u 2 and c m m θ t 0 5 ρ c 2 u 2 the power extraction efficiency for an oscillating airfoil is determined as the ratio of c p to the total incoming power of the working fluid within the swept area over t as 5 η c p c d in which d is the maximum vertical extent swept by the flapping wing as illustrated in fig 1 3 numerical methods the numerical method used in this work is similar to that employed in zhu et al 2019a and a brief description is introduced here the numerical computation was carried out using ansys fluent a two dimensional 2d 70 c 85 c rectangular computational domain was constructed and discretized with a finite volume method as shown in fig 2 the airfoil was modeled as a naca0015 airfoil and a chord based r e c u c ν value of 5 1 0 5 was chosen a relative reference frame with the coordinate origin position attached at the pitching point p of the foil was employed the velocities at the inlet boundary will be adjusted according to the heave velocity accordingly as a result the wing would only undergo pitching motion in the above reference coordinate a circular zone with a diameter of 10 c was set to be a rotating area to facilitate the pitching motion and the boundary was set to be a sliding mesh interface the inlet boundaries at the top the left and the bottom of the domain were prescribed with time varying velocities while the outlet boundary at the right end had a fixed pressure the velocities at the inlet boundaries took into the account of the heave motion of the flapping wing the added source term and revised inlet velocity boundary conditions were defined with the user defined functions udfs here we adopted the mesh and time step configurations i e totally 80000 elements and 4000 time steps per motion cycle and spalart allmaras s a turbulence model recommended by previous researchers zhu et al 2019a kinsey and dumas 2012 more details can be founded therein in this work kinsey s 2d computational and experimental results kinsey et al 2011 kinsey and dumas 2012 were selected to validate the accuracy of current numerical study specifically the test case employed original naca0015 surface profile and the flapping wing motion was conducted with following parameters r e c 5 1 0 5 h 0 c 1 x p c 1 3 θ 0 75 corresponding energy extraction efficiency factors were compared with the reference studies as presented in fig 3 a favorable agreement supporting the feasibility of the proposed simulation technique for the subsequent research is found between the numerical results and the reference study to investigate on how the elastic airbag deformation affect the energy extraction efficiency in this research in the following study we choose airbag configuration with x a 0 25 c and x c 0 05 c as shown in fig 1 a and the local deformation angle amplitude is set to be α 0 15 20 25 4 results and discussion 4 1 energy extraction performance of flapping wing with the active deformation airbag the energy extraction efficiency η of the proposed flapping wing with various local deformation angle amplitude α are shown in fig 4 the horizontal axis is the reduced frequency f f c u for all cases the following configuration is adopted as r e c 5 1 0 5 h 0 c 1 x p c 1 3 θ 0 75 x a 0 25 c x c 0 05 c the results show that with increase of the reduced frequency f the energy extraction efficiency of the flapping wing at various deformation angle α first increases and then decreases with a maximum efficiency η around 0 4 compared with the efficiency curve of the flapping wing with original naca0015 surface profile in the lower frequency range f 0 12 the energy extraction efficiency η is considerably improved for cases with the leading edge deformation amplitude of α 20 25 for example at f 0 10 η has an enhancement of 17 3 and 25 8 for α 20 and 25 respectively also comparable improvement of η by respectively 15 6 and 25 9 also holds at f 0 08 on the other hand in reduced frequency range f 0 12 0 20 the maximum efficiency fails to be improved through the deformable wing configuration applied in this study especially when the deformation angle α equals to 0 or 15 to be short the leading edge active airbag deformation method is capable of extending the reduced frequency coverage where optimal energy extraction performance can be delivered 4 2 working coefficients of the flapping wing to comprehend the performance improvement in the energy extraction efficiency corresponding to the four various deformation angles α of the local elastic airbag in the following we will analyze the corresponding working coefficients as introduced in section 2 the cases with reduced frequency f fixed at 0 1 and 0 14 were selected to be studied considering the fact that the energy efficiency naturally converges to a maximum level as the deformation angle α increases as has been shown in fig 4 fig 5 illustrates the variations of the heave force the pitch torque and their working coefficients in a cycle for four various deformation angles at f 0 1 it is observed that there is a significant difference in the amplitude of the heave forces for the four leading edge local deformation flapping wings especially around the position where t t is equal to 0 25 and 0 75 the maximum gap of the airbag is attained there is also the largest heave force amplitude of the leading edge local deformation flapping wing with α 25 also the heave force directions of the four cases can match well with the heave motion i e v y t direction hence the heave force generally does positive work in one motion cycle the heave force of the flapping wing in the case of α 25 performs the best by doing the most work the amplitudes of the pitch torques for these force flapping wings are close to each other in most time and the pitch torque sometimes does negative work in a cycle due to the anti phase relation between the torque and the pitch motion i e ω t around the time instant of t t 0 425 and t t 0 925 the peak values are obtained for the pitch torque for four cases it can be noticed that the pitch angular velocity ω t and the pitch torque are temporarily in phase resulting in positive power extraction at this moment the pitch torque for the leading edge local deformation flapping wing possesses the highest positive peak value when α equals to 25 as can be seen in fig 5 d for reduced frequency f 0 14 the working coefficients of the flapping wing are shown in fig 6 the heave force coefficient c y for larger local deformation angles α 20 25 are quite similar and varying smoothly with time however for smaller local deformation angles c y has drastic variations around t t 0 5 or 1 0 especially for case with α 15 as a result the power coefficient c p y has a local amplification for flapping wings with smaller deformation angles there is a deficiency of c p y for α 15 compared to other cases but this is compromised by higher power coefficient c p θ around t t 0 5 contributed by the rotational movement as can be seen in fig 6 c d another matter of fact can be found is that despite the amplitude difference flapping wings with α 15 and 0 have similar variation pattern of both c y and c m meanwhile the same statement can be made to cases with α 20 and 25 comparison of working coefficients for f 0 1 and 0 14 shows that the power coefficient c p y dominate over the pitching movement counterpart i e c p θ also as the reduced frequency increases from 0 1 to 0 14 the heave force induced power coefficient c p y amplitude peak increases from 1 75 to 2 5 for flapping wings with larger deformation angles α 20 25 but more importantly the pitch motion induced c p θ in a complete motion cycle drops below zero for cases with higher reduced frequency when we refer to figs 5 d and 6 d it can be deduced that at higher reduced frequencies the torque force will produce more negative work against the pitching motion and consequently impair the improvement of the power efficiency although the heave force induced power coefficient improves compared with lower reduced frequency situations table 1 summarizes the working coefficients for the pitch torque and heave force at different deformation amplitude α with f 0 1 and 0 14 for cases with lower frequency f 0 1 the average power coefficient due to the heave motion c p y grows monotonically as α increases and it is significantly larger than power coefficient c p θ due to the pitch motion the latter c p θ holds positive in four cases and it is of larger values when α equal to 15 or 25 considering contributions form both the pitch and the heave motions the case with α 25 does most positive work hence it delivers the highest energy extraction efficiency for cases with f 0 14 the energy extraction due to heave motion has been improved compared with cases with f 0 1 but the pitch motion will do more negative work as a result the energy extraction efficiency η locates close to 0 4 for flapping wings with f 0 14 and it should be noticed that with α 15 the energy harvested by heave motion is lower than the other 3 cases but the negative due to the pitching motion is also of lower magnitude another fact about the design of local active airbag deformation at the leading edge is with higher deformation angle α 25 higher energy extraction η 0 391 at lower reduced frequency reaches comparable magnitudes with those at f 0 14 which extends the optimal working conditions or reduced frequency significantly for flapping wing energy converters for even higher reduced frequencies e g f 0 14 it is speculated that the pitch force will produce more negative work and reduce the energy extraction further as we can see in fig 4 especially for flapping wings with smaller deformation amplitude α 4 3 analysis on flow characteristics as can be seen from the above section there is an obvious difference between the heave force and the pitch torque at t t 0 25 and 0 425 or t t 0 75 and 0 925 for the cases of local deformation flapping wing with lower reduced frequency f 0 1 and also at t t 0 5 or t t 1 0 for cases with f 0 14 with the surface pressure distribution and analysis on the flow field characteristics around the flapping wing we will continue to analyze the contribution of the pitch torque and heave force to the energy extraction of the flapping wings in the following part and it will help to understand the underlying mechanism of the energy efficiency improvement by the leading edge airbag deformation design proposed in this study for flapping wing cases with f 0 1 fig 7 presents the vortex structures and the pressure distributions for various deformation angle at t t 0 25 it is observed in fig 7 a that the rigid foil without deformation α 0 has a large scale of shedding vortex phenomenon at the trailing and the leading edges this type of early separation of the leading edge vortex is not effective to obtain a high lift force for the flapping wing if α is equal to 15 we can also find the shedding vortex structures however the separation of shedding vortex from the trailing edge is relatively weak and the leading edge shedding vortex is more attached on the flapping wing s lower surface when α is equal to 20 and 25 there is no obvious shedding vortex structures the vortices created from the leading edge is closely attached to the lower surface it contributes to improving the lift force regarding the streamline we can find out that the flow conforms well to the flapping wings geometry by increasing the value of α this helps delay the separation of the flow from the surface thus we can obtain a relatively high value of lift force for the flapping wings the pressure distributions around the flapping wing are presented in fig 7 b and the surface pressure c p s c p s p s p p 0 5 ρ u 2 p s is surface pressure are also extracted and shown in fig 8 the pressure difference in the vertical direction in above figures is an indication for the magnitude of the heave force at the time instant of t t 0 25 the positive pressure distribution on the upper surface of the four various deformation angles is nearly the same and a lower level of negative pressure exists on the lower surface of the flapping wing when the deformation amplitude α is 20 or 25 thus a larger pressure difference or heave force can be obtained between the upper and lower surfaces the reason for such phenomenon is that owing to the local deformation in the upward direction of the leading edge during the downward movement of the flapping wing the velocity of the flow around the lower surface is accelerated while the velocity of the flow near the upper surface of the wing is slowed down as a result the pressure at the upper surface of the wing increases however it decreases at the lower surface the heave forces for deformation amplitude of α 0 and 15 are less compared to that of α 20 or 25 the above content mainly analyzed how the deformation angles of the leading edge local deformation flapping wings affect the heave force at t t 0 25 in the following we focused on time instant t t 0 425 to focus on the pitch motion movement fig 9 represents the vortex and pressure distributions for four various deformation angles of the flapping wing in fig 9 a we can readily notice obvious shedding vortex structures at the trailing edge for all cases the shedding vortex for α 0 has the largest scale and it is located far away from the trailing edge nevertheless when α varies between 15 25 the detached leading edge vortices are located closely under the lower surface of the trailing edge it should be noticed that at t t 0 425 the flapping wing is about to return to the horizontal posture and rotate clockwise around the pitch center consequently the shedding vortex structures will be absorbed and be attached to the lower surface of the trailing edge again hence the formation of a local low pressure region induces the positive work of the pitch motion in figs 9 b and 10 it is observed that in these four cases with increase of the deformation angle α the pressure on the upper surface pressure surface of the flapping wing s trailing edge increases gradually while the pressure on the lower surface suction surface of the trailing edge first increases and then decreases for α 0 there is noticeably a low pressure area on the lower and the upper surfaces of the trailing edge of the airfoil as shown in fig 9 b when α is 20 high pressure is distributed on the lower and the upper surfaces of the trailing edge of the airfoil these pressure distribution scenarios are not conducive to completing the airfoil clockwise pitch movement however when α 15 and α 25 the region above the trailing edge of the airfoil turns to high pressure area while region below the trailing edge is of low pressure which is more significantly for case with α 25 hence a large pressure difference exists between the lower and upper surfaces of the trailing edge of the airfoil this pressure distribution creates a clockwise torque to help the airfoil to complete the clockwise pitching motion this is the reason why pitching torque over the system at α 15 and α 25 does more positive work to the flapping wing compared to the case with α 20 as has been illustrated in table 1 with bold formatting and also fig 5 c d for flapping wing cases with f 0 14 the flow structures and patterns at t t 0 5 for α 0 and 15 are quite different from those of α 20 and 25 for the former vortices of both large and small scales shed around the rotation center a of the elastic airbag at the lower side of the flapping wing inducing more oscillatory variation of working coefficients c y and c m illustrated in fig 6 for cases with larger deformation angle α there is only one shedding vortex under the flapping wing thus leading to more smooth variation of the working coefficients in fig 6 in figs 11 b and 12 the pressure distributions at t t 0 5 for four cases have large areas of negative pressure at both the upper and the lower surfaces the resultant heave force coefficient c y for flapping wings with α 0 and 15 falls close to zero on the other hand there is positive heave force coefficient c y for flapping wings with α 20 and 25 due to larger negative pressure distribution at the upper surface in fig 12 under the same axis scale with figs 8 and 10 the upper side pressure is of mostly negative distribution which is different from the situations with f 1 0 at the lower side large positive pressure at the trailing zone for α 20 and 25 will generate counter clockwise torque force that impairs the clockwise pitch motion the flapping will undergo as illustrated in fig 1 b at t t 0 5 also the power efficiency η will be reduced the local peak for power coefficient c p θ for flapping wing with α 15 as shown in fig 6 can be explained by the large negative pressure distribution at the trailing part of the lower surface which will result in considerable torque force that in phase with the pitching velocity ω as shown in fig 6 c this will reduce the negative work done to the pitch motion throughout the complete motion cycle nevertheless it has to be admitted that the pitch force does negative work for all flapping wings with different α at higher reduced frequency while it does positive work at lower reduced frequency as shown in table 1 to sum up in this section analysis focused on flow distribution and characteristics at representative time instants in the motion cycle for a flapping wing energy converter with active leading edge airbag deformation has been performed the time instants were selected according to figs 5 and 6 for f 0 1 and 0 14 respectively the results show that flapping wings with larger deformation angle α 20 25 have leading edge shedding vortices formed more closely at the suction side at lower reduced frequency f 0 1 and less shedding vortices near the trailing edge at higher reduced frequency f 0 14 as a result preferable surface pressure distributions in such circumstances will promote energy extraction mainly contributed by the heave force contribution c p y with larger amplitude and less oscillation for the same reason it can be speculated that more negative work will be done by the torque force for higher reduced frequency larger than 0 14 and the flow around the wing become more unsteady especially for flapping wings with smaller deformation angle α 0 15 as a results decrease of energy extraction efficiency η has been observed in fig 4 5 conclusions in the present work to enhance energy extraction performance an active elastic airbag deformation at the leading edge is proposed for the flapping wing energy converters the charging and discharging processes of the airbag are accomplished by sinusoidally adjusting the local deformation angle with the chord length based reynolds number r e c at 5 1 0 5 we investigated numerically the effect of the local deformation amplitude α and the reduced frequency f on the energy extraction efficiency η of the flapping wing analysis on the working coefficients and flow characteristics around the wing structure was performed to understand the underlying mechanism of the energy efficiency improvement our results show that 1 the energy extraction efficiency η for different airbag deformation amplitude α first increases and then decreases with a maximum value around 0 40 as the reduce frequency f increases compared with flapping wings with undeformed wing profile the energy extraction efficiency at lower reduced frequency f 0 12 can be increased by up to 25 with larger deformation angle amplitudes i e α 20 and 25 the proposed leading edge local deformation flapping wing with α 20 and 25 can attain optimal energy extraction efficiency with a considerably expanded reduced frequency range compared with flapping wing of undeformed profile 2 for flapping wings with lower reduced frequency i e f 0 1 at t t 0 25 when α is equal to 20 and 25 the leading edge shedding vortices of the flapping wing are more closely attached to the flapping wing s lower surface thus contributing to the improvement of lift force and also the energy extraction efficiency at t t 0 425 the flapping wing is about to return to the horizontal posture and rotates clockwise around the pitch center the shedding vortex structures will be adsorbed and attached to the trailing edge s lower surface again forming a local low pressure region which enhances the positive work due to the pitch motion 3 for flapping wings with higher reduced frequency i e f 0 14 at t t 0 5 the optical energy extraction is obtained for all flapping wings with four local active deformation amplitudes compared with cases of f 0 1 the heave motion contribution is significantly larger while the pitch motion contrarily does negative work the flow analysis shows that larger heave force is induced by the larger negative pressure zone at the upper side of the wing while large negative torque force is a result of the positive pressure zone at the trailing part of the lower surface 4 altogether flapping wings with larger local deformation amplitudes α 20 and 25 have leading edge vortices more closely attached to the suction side at lower reduced frequency f 0 1 and less shedding vortices at the suction side at higher reduced frequency f 0 14 as a result energy extraction with larger amplitude and less oscillation will be delivered it is speculated that more negative work will be done by the torque force for even higher reduced frequency and the flow around the wing become more unsteady especially for flapping wings with smaller deformation amplitudes α 0 and 15 credit authorship contribution statement xiao dong bai

conditions of lateral withdrawal in this study a 3 d numerical model was constructed and validated through experimental tests and the hydrodynamic characteristics of lateral withdrawal under saltwater intrusion were investigated additionally the vertical distribution effects of mainstream velocity withdrawal velocity and density stratification were analyzed under non uniform mainstream velocity conditions with larger surface velocity than bottom velocity the division width of the upper layer is smaller while the local secondary circulation is stronger than that of the lower layer secondary circulation is top shaped and weakens as the withdrawal velocity increases when salinity stratification exists the division width of the lower layer decreases and the secondary circulation is stronger than that of the upper layer meanwhile the vertical water exchange increases the influence of mainstream velocity is greater than that of salinity stratification under these two factors the sediment

the solution variables finally the convergences of the equations are checked 2 1 3 model setup a 3 d hydrodynamic and variable density numerical model was built based on ansys fluent the vertical density stratification was simulated through secondary development using a user defined function udf the mainstream bathymetry water intake arrangement mainstream and withdrawal velocity were set using the lateral intake in a tidal river channel in east guangdong province china the modeling scope covers a 700 m long mainstream 400 m long upstream and 300 m long downstream intake with a mainstream width of 200 m fig 1 the prototype river channel of the case study is relatively straight the bottom bathymetry of the hydrodynamic numerical model uses the cross sectional shape at the intake section the maximum water depth is 16 m and the side bank is vertical structured hexahedral meshes were used with an average mesh size of 0 75 m with some meshes adjusted to the variable boundary near the lateral intake and the total mesh number was 5 28 106 in the simulation the water level was fixed as the designed operation level of lateral intake engineering the upstream boundary of the mainstream was set as an inflow velocity magnitude with normal direction while the downstream boundary of the mainstream was set as the outflow boundary condition in which the flow could be fully developed in the mainstream direction without influencing the flow field near the intake the intake boundary was set as an outflow withdrawal velocity with normal direction considering the bottom roughness may influence the flow field the bottom boundary is set as symmetry condition for the model scenarios section 2 3 to eliminate the influence of the riverbed and facilitate hydrodynamic mechanism analysis additionally in model validation section 3 1 the bottom boundary is set as wall condition with roughness set to simulate the real riverbed to investigate the saltwater intrusion different vertical distributions of mainstream velocity and water density caused by salinity stratification are considered vertical distributions of the mainstream velocity are set at the upstream inflow boundary using the udf the multiphase volume of fluid module vof is used to simulate different density stratifications in the mainstream the freshwater is represented as the first fluid phase with a density of 998 2 kg m3 20 c seawater with 34 salinity and a density of 1026 2 kg m3 outside sea is set as the second fluid phase and the transient phase is their mixtures the vertical density distribution is set for the initial water body and at the inflow boundary using the udf the linear vertical density distribution is adopted in the simulation referring to historical prototype measured density stratification data from the study case 2 1 4 sensitivity analysis to validate the mesh size used a sensitivity analysis was conducted meshes of different sizes were generated and the lateral velocity at point p0 0 2 m depth at the middle of the intake entrance shown in fig 2 was extracted table 1 when the average mesh size is smaller than 1 m the lateral velocity value at point p0 does not change much 1 considering the calculation accuracy and duration an average mesh size of 0 75 m was selected for further model scenario calculations 2 2 experimental tests an experimental model was built to validate the numerical model the model scale is 30 1 and the similar gravity theory was followed the flume covers the 450 m length and 120 m width of the channel the bottom elevation is 16 m in the prototype the bathymetry and hydraulic arrangement were set according to the study case s practical engineering measures the bank slope is inclined 30 and the bottom intake elevation is 3 5 m these are the main differences compared with the numerical model where the bank slope is vertical the bottom intake elevation is 16 m and the bottom boundary is set as a wall condition to study the hydrodynamic characteristics of lateral withdrawal under saltwater intrusion multiple pumps and flowmeters were set at the upstream boundary to control the inflow discharge the gate weirs were set at the downstream boundary to control the water level the water velocity was tested using an lgy iii automatic velocimeter the water level was observed using a needle water level gauge the flow streamlines were observed using permanganate 2 3 model scenarios model scenarios were set according to the local hydrology water salinity and operation schemes of the intake engineering the yearly average mainstream velocity is 0 2 m s different withdrawal velocities and vertical distributions of mainstream velocity and density salinity stratification were considered in the model scenarios table 2 the temporal change of the local water level during the tide is small 0 005 m min on average and the spatial change of water level near the intake is little because of limited mainstream flow hence the water level is fixed as the designed operation level of lateral intake engineering and the spatial temporal change of water level is not considered in the model scenarios additionally considering that the temperature changes little in this estuary channel the temperature variation is not considered here to influence the water density 3 results 3 1 model validation the numerical model was validated fig 3 through experimental tests the validation model mesh was set according to the engineering arrangement its differences with latter simulation model scenarios are as follows the bank slope is inclined 30 as shown in fig 2 b the bottom intake elevation is 3 5 m and the bottom boundary is set as a wall condition different mainstream velocities v m and withdrawal velocities v w were adopted in the model validation results are shown in fig 3 by extracting the lateral velocity of points p1 to p6 fig 2 c the mean absolute error mae and coefficient of determination r2 were calculated to quantify the model fitness he et al 2017 2019 the mae and r2 at a depth of 1 5 m are 0 036 and 0 90 respectively and those at a depth of 3 m are 0 034 and 0 91 respectively the numerical model suitably reflected the spatial temporal hydrodynamic features of lateral withdrawal 3 2 effects of mainstream velocity vertical distribution under the effects of lateral withdrawal the flow direction near the side bank changes towards the intake and secondary circulation occurs under the uniform mainstream velocity scenario a0 the flow field division width and secondary circulation show vertical homogeneity fig 4 a with a maximum turbulent kinetic energy k of 0 0058 m2 s2 the vertical water exchange is low with division widths of 4 95 m for the surface and bottom layers under the non uniform mainstream velocity scenario a1 the hydrodynamic field shows a significant vertical difference fig 4 b as the mainstream velocity of the upper layer is greater than that of the lower layer the upper inertia of the water column in the mainstream is larger the local division width is smaller and the secondary circulation is stronger than that of the lower layer additionally the vertical water exchange increases and secondary circulation is top shaped the maximum turbulent kinetic energies k are 0 007 and 0 0052 m2 s2 respectively for the surface and bottom layers and are higher and lower respectively than those under uniform mainstream velocity conditions a0 the division widths are 1 95 and 12 15 m for the surface and bottom layers respectively 3 3 effects of withdrawal velocity when the withdrawal velocity increases under the non uniform mainstream velocity scenario a1 a2 a3 the withdrawal function increases and the inertia of the water column in the mainstream decreases the top shaped secondary circulation weakens and its vertical and horizontal ranges decrease fig 5 as the surface mainstream velocity is greater than the bottom mainstream velocity the change in secondary circulation in the lower layer is more evident than that in the upper layer when the withdrawal velocity increases from 0 05 to 0 1 m s in this case the secondary circulation in the bottom layer decreases when the withdrawal velocity increases to 0 2 m s the bottom edge of the secondary circulation is approximately at the middle intake layer the maximum turbulent kinetic energies k are 0 0119 and 0 0107 m2 s2 for the surface and bottom layers which are higher and lower respectively than those under the 0 05 m s withdrawal velocity a0 the division widths increase to 3 46 and 24 15 m for the surface and bottom layers respectively 3 4 effects of density salinity stratification when salinity stratification occurs a4 the salinity and density in the lower layers are greater than those in the upper layers increasing the local inertia of the water column fig 6 the division width in the lower layer reduces and secondary circulation is stronger than that in the upper layer meanwhile the vertical water exchange increases compared to the uniform density scenario a0 as the density difference between the surface 998 2 kg m3 and bottom 1026 2 kg m3 layers are modest the flow field division width and secondary circulation are similar between the surface and bottom layers the division widths are 4 98 and 4 93 m for the surface and bottom layers respectively and approximately equal to those under the un stratified scenario 4 95 m for the surface and bottom layers a0 the maximum turbulent kinetic energies k are 0 0057 and 0 0059 m2 s2 for the surface and bottom layers and are slightly higher and lower respectively than those under the homogeneous freshwater scenario 0 0058 m2 s2 a0 4 discussion saltwater intrusion induces vertical differences in mainstream velocity and water density salinity the effects of mainstream velocity distribution on the hydrodynamic characteristics of lateral withdrawal are more significant than those of density stratification the division width of the bottom layer is significantly larger than that of the surface layer and the bottom secondary circulation is reduced this differs from the uniform mainstream velocity scenario where the flow field turbulence and secondary circulation vertical distributions are significantly different considering sediment the bottom division width is larger and the bottom secondary circulation is lower under a non uniform mainstream velocity scenario hence lateral flow and the bottom sediment entering the intake increase for tidal channels with saltwater intrusion under density stratification the vertical water exchange is evident and favorable for the start of bottom sediment considering the mainstream velocity and density salinity stratification functions the bottom sediment entering the intake generally increases therefore engineering measures such as submerged vanes sills and weirs should be adopted to reduce the amount of bottom sediment entering the intake moghadam and keshavarzi 2010 serajian et al 2020 however there are limitations to this study the physical model adopts a uniform water condition that does not include density variability moreover physical model tests including density stratification should be developed to validate and enhance this study density stratification can be induced by adding salt or electrical heating to create a vertical salinity or temperature gradient a linear vertical stratification of density and velocity is used in this study and a more complex vertical stratification with a sharp density and velocity interface can be further investigated krvavica et al 2016 5 conclusions the hydrodynamic characteristics of lateral withdrawal are crucial to the pump intaking efficiency and long term operation by combining numerical simulations and experimental tests this study revealed the hydrodynamic characteristics of lateral withdrawal in a tidal river channel with saltwater intrusion and the effects of non uniform mainstream velocity withdrawal velocity and density salinity stratification were analyzed the main conclusions are as follows 1 under a non uniform mainstream velocity scenario the division width is small 1 95 m for this study and secondary circulation is strong with a higher maximum turbulent kinetic energy of 0 0058 m2 s2 in the upper layer than that in the lower layers 0 0052 m2 s2 the secondary circulation was top shaped 2 when the withdrawal velocity increases under a non uniform mainstream velocity scenario the top shaped secondary circulation weakens and its vertical and horizontal ranges decrease 3 when salinity and density stratification occur the division width decreases and secondary circulation becomes stronger in the lower layer and weaker in the upper layer meanwhile the vertical water exchange increases 4 the effects of a non uniform mainstream velocity are greater than those of salinity stratification considering these two factors the bottom sediment entering the intake increases for tidal channels with saltwater intrusion requiring the adoption of measures such as submerged vanes sills or weirs this study enhances the understanding of lateral withdrawal hydrodynamics and provides a technical guide for intake design in tidal channels with more water utilization in estuaries and coastal areas hydrodynamic research

respectively the numerical model suitably reflected the spatial temporal hydrodynamic features of lateral withdrawal 3 2 effects of mainstream velocity vertical distribution under the effects of lateral withdrawal the flow direction near the side bank changes towards the intake and secondary circulation occurs under the uniform mainstream velocity scenario a0 the flow field division width and secondary circulation show vertical homogeneity fig 4 a with a maximum turbulent kinetic energy k of 0 0058 m2 s2 the vertical water exchange is low with division widths of 4 95 m for the surface and bottom layers under the non uniform mainstream velocity scenario a1 the hydrodynamic field shows a significant vertical difference fig 4 b as the mainstream velocity of the upper layer is greater than that of the lower layer the upper inertia of the water column in the mainstream is larger the local division width is smaller and the secondary circulation is stronger than that of the lower layer additionally the vertical water exchange increases and secondary circulation is top shaped the maximum turbulent kinetic energies k are 0 007 and 0 0052 m2 s2 respectively for the surface and bottom layers and are higher and lower respectively than those under uniform mainstream velocity conditions a0 the division widths are 1 95 and 12 15 m for the surface and bottom layers respectively 3 3 effects of withdrawal velocity when the withdrawal velocity increases under the non uniform mainstream velocity scenario a1 a2 a3 the withdrawal function increases and the inertia of the water column in the mainstream decreases the top shaped secondary circulation weakens and its vertical and horizontal ranges decrease fig 5 as the surface mainstream velocity is greater than the bottom mainstream velocity the change in secondary circulation in the lower layer is more evident than that in the upper layer when the withdrawal velocity increases from 0 05 to 0 1 m s in this case the secondary circulation in the bottom layer decreases when the withdrawal velocity increases to 0 2 m s the bottom edge of the secondary circulation is approximately at the middle intake layer the maximum turbulent kinetic energies k are 0 0119 and 0 0107 m2 s2 for the surface and bottom layers which are higher and lower respectively than those under the 0 05 m s withdrawal velocity a0 the division widths increase to 3 46 and 24 15 m for the surface and bottom layers respectively 3 4 effects of density salinity stratification when salinity stratification occurs a4 the salinity and density in the lower layers are greater than those in the upper layers increasing the local inertia of the water column fig 6 the division width in the lower layer reduces and secondary circulation is stronger than that in the upper layer meanwhile the vertical water exchange increases compared to the uniform density scenario a0 as the density difference between the surface 998 2 kg m3 and bottom 1026 2 kg m3 layers are modest the flow field division width and secondary circulation are similar between the surface and bottom layers the division widths are 4 98 and 4 93 m for the surface and bottom layers respectively and approximately equal to those under the un stratified scenario 4 95 m for the surface and bottom layers a0 the maximum turbulent kinetic energies k are 0 0057 and 0 0059 m2 s2 for the surface and bottom layers and are slightly higher and lower respectively than those under the homogeneous freshwater scenario 0 0058 m2 s2 a0 4 discussion saltwater intrusion induces vertical differences in mainstream velocity and water density salinity the effects of mainstream velocity distribution on the hydrodynamic characteristics of lateral withdrawal are more significant than those of density stratification the division width of the bottom layer is significantly larger than that of the surface layer and the bottom secondary circulation is reduced this differs from the uniform mainstream velocity scenario where the flow field turbulence and secondary circulation vertical distributions are significantly different considering sediment the bottom division width is larger and the bottom secondary circulation is lower under a non uniform mainstream velocity scenario hence lateral flow and the bottom sediment entering the intake increase for tidal channels with saltwater intrusion under density stratification the vertical water exchange is evident and favorable for the start of bottom sediment considering the mainstream velocity and density salinity stratification functions the bottom sediment entering the intake generally increases therefore engineering measures such as submerged vanes sills and weirs should be adopted to reduce the amount of bottom sediment entering the intake moghadam and keshavarzi 2010 serajian et al 2020 however there are limitations to this study the physical model adopts a uniform water condition that does not include density variability moreover physical model tests including density stratification should be developed to validate and enhance this study density stratification can be induced by adding salt or electrical heating to create a vertical salinity or temperature gradient a linear vertical stratification of density and velocity is used in this study and a more complex vertical stratification with a sharp density and velocity interface can be further investigated krvavica et al 2016 5 conclusions the hydrodynamic characteristics of lateral withdrawal are crucial to the pump intaking efficiency and long term operation by combining numerical simulations and experimental tests this study revealed the hydrodynamic characteristics of lateral withdrawal in a tidal river channel with saltwater intrusion and the effects of non uniform mainstream velocity withdrawal velocity and density salinity stratification were analyzed the main conclusions are as follows 1 under a non uniform mainstream velocity scenario the division width is small 1 95 m for this study and secondary circulation is strong with a higher maximum turbulent kinetic energy of 0 0058 m2 s2 in the upper layer than that in the lower layers 0 0052 m2 s2 the secondary circulation was top shaped 2 when the withdrawal velocity increases under a non uniform mainstream velocity scenario the top shaped secondary circulation weakens and its vertical and horizontal ranges decrease 3 when salinity and density stratification occur the division width decreases and secondary circulation becomes stronger in the lower layer and weaker in the upper layer meanwhile the vertical water exchange increases 4 the effects of a non uniform mainstream velocity are greater than those of salinity stratification considering these two factors the bottom sediment entering the intake increases for tidal channels with saltwater intrusion requiring the adoption of measures such as submerged vanes sills or weirs this study enhances the understanding of lateral withdrawal hydrodynamics and provides a technical guide for intake design in tidal channels with more water utilization in estuaries and coastal areas hydrodynamic research

20832,ocean engineers are often tasked with developing innovative low cost floating offshore wind turbines as the industry moves toward deeper waters to access regions with higher offshore wind potential one example is the hanging mass concept in which a suspended counterweight stabilizes a positively buoyant floater a hybrid design that combines a spar s performance with the maneuverability of a semi submersible simultaneously using elastic cables instead of a rigid support structure to support a low center of mass presents the opportunity for cost savings this work presents experimental results from tests conducted on a 1 48 scale model of a conceptual hanging mass floating offshore wind turbine design compared with traditional platform designs the hanging mass s response amplitude operators raos show a generally better response in heave and pitch as the natural periods occur well outside the wave energy range unlike the other platforms examined comparison between the line tension raos for systems with different suspension line stiffness indicate that softer systems experience larger tension fluctuations at low periods while the inverse is true for stiff systems finally response spectra show that high frequency modes describing relative motion between the two bodies are excited by irregular waves likely due to sum frequency second order effects keywords hanging mass floating offshore wind turbine scale model tests response amplitude operator 1 introduction the transition from onshore to offshore wind power began in shallow waters off denmark s coast in 1993 olsen and dyre 1993 since then the global offshore wind industry has matured to a point where the levelized cost of energy has become increasingly competitive with traditional electricity generation methods the evolution of the offshore wind industry in europe was facilitated partly due to shallow coastal seas which allowed for the widespread use of fixed base support structures however this is not the case in the united states where deeper waters combined with complex permitting processes have hindered the development of utility scale offshore projects approximately 84 of the united states gross offshore wind resource capacity is estimated to exist in waters exceeding 60 m in depth musial et al 2016 thus the development of innovative low cost floating platforms is crucial to the offshore wind industry s progression in the united states there are currently several floating offshore wind turbine fowt designs that are operational or in various development stages these designs are derived from three concepts that have experienced widespread use in the oil and gas industry 1 the spar 2 the semi submersible and 3 the tension leg platform tlp each concept relies on a unique mechanism to achieve stability which leads to qualitatively different behavior det norske veritas 2010 for example semi submersibles are buoyancy stabilized meaning that buoyancy changes caused by pitch and roll generate a restoring moment proportional to the waterplane moment of inertia on the other hand spars are ballast stabilized in the sense that a low center of gravity generates a restoring moment to stabilize the structure in a manner analogous to a pendulum finally tlps are positively buoyant at their design draft and a series of taut mooring lines counteract this excess buoyancy examples of semi submersible fowts include maine aqua ventus s volturnus viselli et al 2015 and principle power s windfloat roddier et al 2010 while equinor s hywind skaare et al 2014 and sbm offshore s design caillé et al 2017 are examples of a spar and tlp respectively each concept presents unique strengths and weaknesses recently naval architects and ocean engineers have developed hybrid designs that maximize the strengths and minimize the weaknesses of the three conventional oil and gas based designs one such option is the hanging mass concept in which a negatively buoyant counterweight stabilizes a positively buoyant floater the counterweight is suspended beneath the floater by suspension lines composed of either chain wire rope synthetics or a combination of the three a significant challenge in designing such platforms is to control the relative motion between the two bodies and prevent suspension lines from going slack the floater s waterplane area is relatively small and the counterweight sits at a depth of up to 100 m in the installed configuration therefore a low center of gravity is the source of stability and the system is likely to exhibit spar like behaviors however this concept uses semi submersible like deployment techniques after de ballasting the floater and raising the counterweight to reduce the total draft that said the radial footprint will be smaller than a semi submersible since the hanging mass fowt is designed to behave like a spar during operation and does not require a large waterplane area moment of inertia for stability in operational sea states finally the suspension lines exhibit many of the same characteristics as a tlp s tendons for example the authors anticipate a high frequency response representing relative motion between the two bodies similar to the springing and ringing responses experienced by tlps the stiesdal offshore technologies a s tetraspar borg et al 2019 the saipem hexafloat quest floating wind energy llc 2020 and the esteyco telwind armesto et al 2018 are examples of hanging mass fowts that are currently under development the rendering in fig 1 is of the conceptual hanging mass design used in this study and exhibits the typical general arrangement of a hanging mass fowt including a positively buoyant floater a negatively buoyant counterweight and a series of angled suspension lines the present study s subject is differentiated from other hanging mass type platforms by unique hull geometry suspension line configuration and material sec 2 discusses these differences in detail the hanging mass fowt presents many unique design challenges of which little information is available in the existing literature and the multi body nature of the system is the primary concern multi body problems are not uncommon in the field of ocean engineering kral and kreuzer 1999 newman 2001 for example modern wave energy devices typically involve complex multi body interactions and are designed to achieve large relative motion drew et al 2009 however this behavior contradicts the desired response of a hanging mass fowt perhaps the most relatable problem to this application is maritime lifting operations liu 1973 niedzwecki and thampi 1991 hann 1995 where a suspended load is attached to a shipboard crane and subjected to wave excitation however the load is often assumed to weigh several orders of magnitude less than the ship allowing for decoupling the motions of the load from the ship therefore problems of this nature are typically analyzed using base excitation at the tip of the crane s boom however this is not the case for the hanging mass fowt where the counterweight may exceed the floater s weight so far the existing literature on the hanging mass concept is limited to a few studies of the tetraspar and the telwind platforms pereyra et al 2018 conducted a parametric study of the 10 mw tetraspar with the focus of maintaining positive tension in the suspension lines at all times here the counterweight draft was increased while decreasing the counterweight mass to find the lightest therefore cheapest system within operational constraints the system s rigid body hydrostatic stiffness was held constant by appropriately sizing the counterweight more recently a scale model of the 3 6 mw tetraspar was tested at the advanced structures and composites center s ascc alfond w2 ocean engineering laboratory w2 located at the university of maine umaine borg et al 2019 pegalajar jurado et al 2019 identified the sea state dependent damping ratios using operational modal analysis results show a clear amplitude dependence in pitch damping which is much more significant for higher sea states than the values observed during free decay tests a study by armesto et al 2018 on the telwind sought to develop an ad hoc numerical model of the system and presented the results of experimental validation results show that this numerical model was capable of accurately simulating the system s response in both regular and irregular waves more recently yang et al 2020 studied fatigue damage of the tendons using a fully coupled model consisting of incorporating openfast in an ansys aqwa analysis through a dynamic library link dll noting the limitation of commonly used numerical tools in the ability examine multi body problems such as this in particular ansys aqwa does not currently include fully coupled aero servo elastic wind turbine models and openfast does not permit multi body support structures this study concluded that wind wave coupling is critical to proper fatigue assessment showing that combined loading reduced tension fluctuations by 43 7 furthermore the exclusion of wind wave coupling reduces fatigue life estimation by 20 years this work is part of a larger research project that involves developing a suitable numerical model for this problem to address some of the current modeling limitations noted by yang et al 2020 this simplified model s formulation allows for an openfast module for multi body fowts to be developed in the future eliminating the need for complex coupling between existing codes and allowing for rapid design space exploration a detailed description of this work including model validation can be found in ward et al 2021 this paper however presents the results of a series of experiments conducted on a 1 48 scale model of a conceptual 6 mw hanging mass fowt design that makes use of post tensioned segmented concrete construction methods the results are compared to the deepcwind model tests results goupee et al 2014 koo et al 2014 to illustrate the differences between the hanging mass concept and the classical semi submersible spar and tlp designs the deepcwind tests provided some of the first data sets for fowts which often serve as a benchmark for unique designs allen et al 2019 and numerical model validation the test matrix is repeated for two different suspension systems to evaluate suspension stiffness s effect on the system s global performance the primary contributions of this work are as follows comparison between the dynamic behavior of a hanging mass fowt and three canonical examples effect of line stiffness on global system performance dynamic behavior baseline of a novel concrete hanging mass fowt design 2 model description a 1 48 scale model of a conceptual 6 mw concrete hanging mass fowt is the subject of this study the floater is assumed to comprise the hull tower wind turbine and other miscellaneous machinery the floater s base comprises four rectangular bottom beams connected using post tensioned tendons running through a keystone to form a cross a cylindrical column which supports the tower and turbine is mounted directly to the keystone and is connected to each bottom beam using a radial brace as seen in fig 1 the floater is composed of lightweight post tensioned concrete segments except the radial braces which are steel the counterweight is simply a large bucket made out of high density concrete and filled with a dense ballast such as iron ore and is open to the environment finally for the sake of simplicity a taut mooring system is used here a mooring line with a full scale extensional stiffness of 7 93 mn runs directly from the floater fairleads located at the end of each bottom beam to the basin walls or struts mounted to bridges as previously mentioned this hanging mass concept shares many similarities with the tetraspar hexafloat and telwind designs but also includes several original design features first this concept uses eight suspension lines four symmetric pairs to support the counterweight while other concepts use six suspension lines the use of six lines yields a statically determinate structure which means that there will be no relative motion between the two bodies under the condition that each line remains under tension at all times however the system will become improperly constrained and therefore unstable if a single line is lost conversely the subject of this study is over determined eight equations representing the tension in each line six unknowns representing the six degrees of freedom when eight lines make up the suspension system this redundancy adds some complexity to analysis constitutive equations are required to determine the pretension in each line but increases the design s safety factor here the system will remain stable until three lines are lost next the concept uses existing post tensioned segmented concrete technologies for assembly this construction technique combined with the use of locally sourced material and labor is expected to reduce capital expenses musial et al 2020 note that the telwind platform is also composed of concrete but uses slip forming techniques table 1 provides pertinent full scale specifications of this hanging mass concept and fig 2 provides an image of the scale model note that no turbine is visible in fig 2 previous work has shown that the global response of fowt in the wave energy frequency range is often weakly influenced by turbine dynamics goupee et al 2014 moreover wave induced motions are the primary focus of this work thus a correctly sized point mass replaces a fully operational turbine model and gross aerodynamic loads are applied electro mechanically this modeling approach is for simplicity as this research aims to understand the influence of the counterweight on the system response not the turbine multiple materials are available including steel chain and synthetic ropes that are applicable for use as suspension lines the design of which is not trivial designing any offshore mooring system requires determining fatigue performance however the need to understand the relative motion between the two bodies to minimize tension fluctuations precedes fatigue analysis the present study uses two sets of suspension lines to assess line stiffness s influence on global performance a soft system with a full scale extensional stiffness of 392 mn per line followed by a stiff system with a full scale axial stiffness of approximately 1 900 mn per line the unstretched length of each set of lines is set such that each line experiences a pretension of 5 270 kn to ensure that the counterweight s equilibrium position is the same for each case 3 environments the model described in sec 2 was subjected to an array of wave environments including six regular waves and one broadband spectrum pink noise irregular wave table 2 provides the period spread across the typical wave energy range 5 s 25 s and height of each regular wave the system s response caused by the pink noise spectrum is used to identify the system s natural frequencies and generate response amplitude operators rao table 3 lists the characteristics of the spectrum which is plotted in fig 3 along with a pink noise wave used during the deepcwind model tests note that the drop in the pink noise spectra at high periods is sharp and is softened in fig 3 due to smoothing of the spectra for plotting purposes furthermore the spectrum s period range extends beyond what is typically considered the linear wave energy range to observe the linear resonant response of the heave and pitch modes in addition to the typical linear response in the wave energy range finally a constant full scale thrust load of 850 kn is applied to the nacelle using a line connected to a servo motor constant thrust is maintained using an in line load cell regardless of the system s motion 4 results this section summarizes the experimental results of the hanging mass fowt model using the previously described environmental conditions fig 4 illustrates the floater and counterweight orientation the degrees of freedom dof and the line numbering convention relative to the wave propagation direction this orientation allows for the assumption that the sway roll and yaw motions are small since the waves propagate in the positive x direction furthermore the sway and roll raos should not be significantly different from the surge and pitch raos resulting from orthogonal waves due to the system s symmetry accordingly these results provide only the surge heave and pitch displacements of each body s center of gravity relative to the respective equilibrium position the results include comparisons between dynamic behavior of the hanging mass fowt and the deepcwind spar semi submersible and tlp platforms tested by goupee et al 2014 however there are several differences between the experimental campaigns first the deepcwind results are for a 5 mw system in contrast with the 6 mw system used in this study next the reference point for the reported data is the platform center of gravity which depends on the structure finally the deepcwind experiments used a different wave spectrum shown in fig 3 however the results provide a qualitative comparison between the hanging mass concept s behavior and the three classical concepts table 4 summarizes the relevant specifications of each deepcwind platform and a more detailed discussion may be found in goupee et al 2014 and koo et al 2014 experimental best practices including sensor calibration balancing load cells and recording each body s equilibrium position before each test case ensured the accuracy of the results sufficient time was allowed after a test for any remaining waves and motion to decay before starting the next test run a qualysis motion capture system recorded displacements and interface wmc 220n 1239 load cells measured tension in the suspension and mooring lines the motion tracking system used five above water and three below water cameras and was calibrated daily per manufacturer directions and specifications with a calibrated residual error no greater than 1 mm at model scale typically calibrated residual error values were between 0 3 mm and 0 9 mm this error was also monitored during individual runs to ensure that calibration was maintained the load cells have a reported uncertainty of 0 03 4 1 free decay results the natural periods and viscous damping coefficients were estimated using free decays tests for each suspension configuration numerical models require viscous damping coefficients for calibration while natural periods provide useful information about the system s behavior first the floater was given an initial displacement in either surge heave or pitch and held until reaching a zero velocity state by extension one may assume that the counterweight must have the same initial displacement as the floater under these conditions from here the structure is released and allowed to decay to an equilibrium position naturally the data shows that the floater and counterweight displacements are in phase acting as a single rigid body meaning that these results provide the periods and damping values for the predominately surge heave and pitch modes an alternate methodology possibly mechanical oscillation is required to excite the high frequency modes that describe relative motion between the two bodies furthermore the line stiffness only influences the high frequency modes so no change is visible in the free decay results between the soft and stiff suspension line configurations the recorded natural periods of the hanging mass fowt are reported in table 5 and compared to the deepcwind results goupee et al 2014 first the hanging mass concept s surge response falls between the upper and lower bounds set by the tlp and semi submersible the natural surge period is primarily governed by the mooring stiffness which referring back to sec 2 is not representative of a full scale system thus the implemented system fulfills the requirement of having a natural period that falls outside the wave energy range typically between 5 s and 25 s and agrees well with predicted values a more informative comparison of each platform s relative behavior is available by examining the natural heave and pitch periods the hanging mass concept s heave period is well outside of the wave energy range and closest to a spar the same can be said about the natural pitch period although the hanging mass concept and spar values are closer in value this trend is expected since the parameters that govern the hydrostatic heave waterplane area and pitch waterplane moment of area and center of gravity stiffness are similar between the two systems on the other hand the periods of the tlp and semi submersible are characteristically different this correlation suggests that a hanging mass concept might exhibit performance characteristics similar to a spar finally the damping ratios obtained for the free decay results are provided in fig 5 and compared with those obtained for the deepcwind semi submersible and spar the natural periods of the hanging mass fowt closely resemble those of the spar however the damping ratios are more in line with the semi submersible the submerged portion of the spar is slender leading to relatively low damping ratios in contrast the bottom beams and heave plates generate higher damping ratios for the hanging mass concept and semi submersible respectively particularly in heave and surge moreover the geometric similarities and experimental results indicate that the counterweight has a relatively low contribution to the total damping in heave and surge 4 2 pink noise waves here tests conducted using pink noise spectra are used to determine the linear raos and nonlinear responses and repeated for each combination of line stiffness defined in sec 2 and pink noise wave defined in table 3 the soft suspension system results are compared to the deepcwind result to demonstrate the hanging mass concept s performance relative to proven designs on the other hand the stiff system results are compared to the soft system to demonstrate the effect of the line stiffness on the system s global performance the discussion also includes a comparison with regular wave results as an indicator of nonlinear behavior 4 2 1 soft suspension linear response amplitude operators the linear position raos for both the floater and counterweight using the soft suspension system compared to the deepcwind platforms are shown in fig 6 note that the natural periods of the hanging mass concept are all outside of the linear wave excitation range as shown in table 5 leading to low linear wave induced motions between the periods of 5 s and 25 s the surge rao is shown in fig 6 a first there is a noticeable difference in the floater and counterweight surge amplitudes as expected since there is a strong coupling between floater pitch and counterweight surge the floater surge and pitch displacements are in phase with each other over the wave energy period range hence if the floater experiences a positive surge displacement in the absence of pitch then the counterweight s surge displacement will be the same however if the floater experiences pitch the counterweight will be moved in the negative surge direction thus the counterweight experiences a lower surge amplitude relative to the floater as shown in fig 6 a next a strong agreement is observable between the irregular and regular wave results which is a good indicator that other effects such as second order sum frequency loads are not significant in the range of periods shown finally the hanging mass surge results are on the same order of magnitude as the canonical deepcwind floaters agreement between the floater and the semi submersible is especially strong which is likely a result of similarities in the respective submerged geometries the submerged geometries of the semi submersible and floater of the hanging mass concept are characterized by added mass values and drag coefficients that are notably larger than the spar moving on fig 6 b provides the heave rao here the floater and counterweight heave amplitudes are nearly indistinguishable unlike the surge response indicating that relative vertical motion between the two bodies is small within the linear wave excitation range fig 7 which focuses on comparing the floater and counterweight heave raos highlights the absence of vertical level motion again the agreement between the regular and irregular waves is good and indicative of a primarily linear response the heave response of the hanging mass fowt is characteristically similar to those of the semi submersible and spar platforms note that the tlp heave response is small due to constraints provided by the tendons the natural heave periods of the semi submersible and spar see table 5 are in if not close to the linear wave excitation range and the resulting resonant response is seen in fig 6 b on the other hand the hanging mass concept s natural heave period is well outside the wave energy range and is not excited however the hanging mass fowt has a slightly higher amplitude than the semi submersible and spar due to increased wave loading on the bottom beams next the pitch rao is shown in fig 6 overall similar trends to those seen in the surge and heave responses are observable the floater and counterweight responses are nearly the same except for periods near 10 s where the floater response exceeds the counterweight which is likely a consequence of elasticity in the suspension lines and is also visible in the regular wave data again the hanging mass concept s response is similar to the semi submersible and spar up to approximately 24 s when resonance appears in the semi submersible response the hanging mass concept s and spar s natural pitch periods are very similar at 30 4 s and 31 5 s respectively interestingly the hanging mass concept s response is notably less than the spar near the natural periods at the wave energy range s upper limit indicating that the hanging mass concept is more heavily damped in pitch than the spar which is in agreement with the results shown in fig 5 finally fig 8 illustrates the rao of the suspension line tension although the configuration uses eight suspension lines only four load cells were available here lines 1 4 5 and 8 according to the convention defined in fig 4 are instrumented since they would be the first to go slack due to symmetry only the data lines 1 and 4 are present in fig 8 again the regular wave results agree with the irregular wave results the exception occurs at approximately 8 s which is also where the peak response occurs this peak coincides with the maximum relative motion between the two bodies which is visible in fig 7 these raos establish the hanging mass concept s behavior in the wave energy range and prove that the system s performance is comparable to the three canonical deepcwind floaters as previously stated the system discussed here is not optimized and represents an initial concept design however the results and comparisons shown in this paper indicate that further investigation is justifiable 4 2 2 stiff suspension linear response amplitude operators next the effect of suspension line stiffness is examined by comparing the raos for the soft and stiff suspension line configurations defined in sec 2 these results exclude the deepcwind platforms since an in depth discussion on each system s response relative to the hanging mass concept was presented in the previous section fig 9 shows the comparison between the soft and stiff position raos overall the same trends regarding an agreement with regular wave results and resonance are observable interestingly the difference between the soft and stiff results is small particularly in the surge fig 9 a and heave fig 9 b response the main observable differences occur in the pitch response shown in fig 9 c first a relatively large difference between the regular waves and irregular waves is visible at 8 33 s more explicitly the counterweight pitch determined using regular waves is notably larger than the irregular waves while a strong agreement is observable in the floater response this discrepancy is presumably indicative of nonlinear response next a large difference between the floater and counterweight response is observed in the soft configuration but is not present in the stiff condition additionally the relative response between the floater and counterweight is more significant in the stiff system than in the soft system at higher wave periods suggesting that soft systems will experience greater dynamic tension amplitudes than stiff systems at lower wave periods in comparison the inverse is true at higher wave periods next fig 10 presents a comparison between the stiff and soft line tension raos including only the tensions for lines 1 and 4 the tension raos support the conclusions drawn from the position raos primarily soft lines experience more significant tension fluctuations at low wave periods and stiff systems experience higher fluctuations at high wave periods these differences in magnitude may appear small based on the results seen in fig 10 but only one order of magnitude separates the line stiffnesses used in this study the authors anticipate that the amplitude difference would increase by using a broader range of line stiffnesses 4 2 3 response spectra the behavior of the hanging mass concept and the effect of line stiffness are investigated further by examining the power spectral density psd here the system s response spectra are generated using the pink noise wave for both the soft and stiff configurations allowing for low and high frequency responses that occur outside of the linear wave excitation range to be examined recall that a spectrum was used that covered the natural heave and pitch frequencies so that the linear resonant response of these modes could be observed in addition to the typical linear response in the wave energy range that said the comparisons do not attempt to emulate realistic cases rather they are showing the comparison of the linear response over a large range of frequencies for two different configurations the rigid body natural frequencies are well outside the wave energy range for realistic sea states and resonance will not be a large concern unless they are excited by wind loading or difference frequency loads the displacement response spectra are provided in fig 11 beginning with the surge response shown in fig 11 a a distinct peak in the counterweight response occurs at approximately 0 03 hz falling just inside the wave energy range this peak does not correspond with the natural surge frequency but rather with the natural pitch frequency due to the strong surge pitch coupling experienced by the counterweight the natural surge frequency appears as the small hump seen at approximately 0 01 hz in fig 11 a and is a result of nonlinear difference frequency wave loads the soft and stiff responses are generally the same however the stiff system experiences larger relative motion between the floater and counterweight in the vicinity of the natural pitch frequency in practice the suspension line design would mimic mooring line design practice by following the guidance of governing bodies such as the american bureau of shipping abs or dnv gl the unique differences between the hanging mass concept and conventional designs will likely require the development of similar guidelines next the heave response is shown in fig 11 b here very little difference between the floater and counterweight response for either the soft or stiff suspension configurations the peak response occurs at approximately 0 04 hz which is in the vicinity of the estimated natural heave frequency this peak is a wave induced response as the wave excitation ranges from 0 025 hz to 0 200 hz however this peak is far less distinct than those seen in the pitch response indicating that the heave response experiences relatively higher damping fig 11 c presents the pitch response where the peak response coincides with the natural pitch period at approximately 0 03 hz there is little difference between the soft and stiff systems however the relative pitch motion between the floater and counterweight is more significant in the soft system compared to the stiff system next the tension response is provided in fig 12 the peak response occurs at approximately 0 03 hz which coincides with the natural pitch frequency additionally a small but noticeable peak occurs between 0 3 hz and 0 35 hz and represents the sum frequency excitation of the high frequency modes that describe relative motion between the two bodies this response appears in the displacement responses but is less visible finally a constant thrust load is applied to the system to estimate the effect that a non zero mean pitch angle has on the system s response and fig 13 illustrates the resulting tension response first the low frequency response at 0 03 hz has is significantly lower while the high frequency response at 0 3 hz has increased additionally the stiff lines exhibit a higher response than the soft lines in the wave energy range which is a reversal from the results generated with no thrust 5 conclusions this work presents results obtained during a model test of a conceptual hanging mass fowt design primarily made of post tensioned segmented concrete this work s primary results are the linear raos of the system for two suspension configurations compared with those of the deepcwind semi submersible spar and tlp additional results include response spectra of the hanging mass concept for two suspension configurations overall the linear raos are similar to those of the deepcwind semi submersible and spar the main difference is that all of the rigid body natural periods of the hanging mass concept occur at periods outside the linear wave excitation range in contrast to the semi submersible and spar no profound difference in the displacement raos is observable between the soft and stiff suspension line configurations however slight differences are visible in the tension response where soft systems experience higher dynamic tension fluctuations at low periods and the opposite is true for high periods this difference is expected to amplify when a wider range of line stiffness is considered the response spectra agree with the raos in the linear wave excitation range and the occurrence of natural periods agrees with free decay results however two interesting observations arise first the heave response appears to experience relatively high damping levels as the resonant peak is significantly less clear than the other dofs second the tension response spectra indicate that the high frequency modes describing relative motion between the floater and counterweight may be excited presumably by second order sum frequency loads this phenomenon requires further investigation but may be similar to the high frequency springing and ringing responses experienced by tlps in conclusion this study has introduced experimental results for a hanging mass fowt which supplements the existing deepcwind data sets moreover the results indicate that the hanging mass fowt compares well with the proven semi submersible spar and tlp platforms results further suggest that using elastic cables instead of costly rigid support structures is an effective means of lowering the center of gravity thus the hanging mass fowt presents an opportunity to reduce the levelized cost of energy without sacrificing performance credit authorship contribution statement jacob c ward

20832,ocean engineers are often tasked with developing innovative low cost floating offshore wind turbines as the industry moves toward deeper waters to access regions with higher offshore wind potential one example is the hanging mass concept in which a suspended counterweight stabilizes a positively buoyant floater a hybrid design that combines a spar s performance with the maneuverability of a semi submersible simultaneously using elastic cables instead of a rigid support structure to support a low center of mass presents the opportunity for cost savings this work presents experimental results from tests conducted on a 1 48 scale model of a conceptual hanging mass floating offshore wind turbine design compared with traditional platform designs the hanging mass s response amplitude operators raos show a generally better response in heave and pitch as the natural periods occur well outside the wave energy range unlike the other platforms examined comparison between the line tension raos for systems with different suspension line stiffness indicate that softer systems experience larger tension fluctuations at low periods while the inverse is true for stiff systems finally response spectra show that high frequency modes describing relative motion between the two bodies are excited by irregular waves likely due to sum frequency second order effects keywords hanging mass floating offshore wind turbine scale model tests response amplitude operator 1 introduction the transition from onshore to offshore wind power began in shallow waters off denmark s coast in 1993 olsen and dyre 1993 since then the global offshore wind industry has matured to a point where the levelized cost of energy has become increasingly competitive with traditional electricity generation methods the evolution of the offshore wind industry in europe was facilitated partly due to shallow coastal seas which allowed for the widespread use of fixed base support structures however this is not the case in the united states where deeper waters combined with complex permitting processes have hindered the development of utility scale offshore projects approximately 84 of the united states gross offshore wind resource capacity is estimated to exist in waters exceeding 60 m in depth musial et al 2016 thus the development of innovative low cost floating platforms is crucial to the offshore wind industry s progression in the united states there are currently several floating offshore wind turbine fowt designs that are operational or in various development stages these designs are derived from three concepts that have experienced widespread use in the oil and gas industry 1 the spar 2 the semi submersible and 3 the tension leg platform tlp each concept relies on a unique mechanism to achieve stability which leads to qualitatively different behavior det norske veritas 2010 for example semi submersibles are buoyancy stabilized meaning that buoyancy changes caused by pitch and roll generate a restoring moment proportional to the waterplane moment of inertia on the other hand spars are ballast stabilized in the sense that a low center of gravity generates a restoring moment to stabilize the structure in a manner analogous to a pendulum finally tlps are positively buoyant at their design draft and a series of taut mooring lines counteract this excess buoyancy examples of semi submersible fowts include maine aqua ventus s volturnus viselli et al 2015 and principle power s windfloat roddier et al 2010 while equinor s hywind skaare et al 2014 and sbm offshore s design caillé et al 2017 are examples of a spar and tlp respectively each concept presents unique strengths and weaknesses recently naval architects and ocean engineers have developed hybrid designs that maximize the strengths and minimize the weaknesses of the three conventional oil and gas based designs one such option is the hanging mass concept in which a negatively buoyant counterweight stabilizes a positively buoyant floater the counterweight is suspended beneath the floater by suspension lines composed of either chain wire rope synthetics or a combination of the three a significant challenge in designing such platforms is to control the relative motion between the two bodies and prevent suspension lines from going slack the floater s waterplane area is relatively small and the counterweight sits at a depth of up to 100 m in the installed configuration therefore a low center of gravity is the source of stability and the system is likely to exhibit spar like behaviors however this concept uses semi submersible like deployment techniques after de ballasting the floater and raising the counterweight to reduce the total draft that said the radial footprint will be smaller than a semi submersible since the hanging mass fowt is designed to behave like a spar during operation and does not require a large waterplane area moment of inertia for stability in operational sea states finally the suspension lines exhibit many of the same characteristics as a tlp s tendons for example the authors anticipate a high frequency response representing relative motion between the two bodies similar to the springing and ringing responses experienced by tlps the stiesdal offshore technologies a s tetraspar borg et al 2019 the saipem hexafloat quest floating wind energy llc 2020 and the esteyco telwind armesto et al 2018 are examples of hanging mass fowts that are currently under development the rendering in fig 1 is of the conceptual hanging mass design used in this study and exhibits the typical general arrangement of a hanging mass fowt including a positively buoyant floater a negatively buoyant counterweight and a series of angled suspension lines the present study s subject is differentiated from other hanging mass type platforms by unique hull geometry suspension line configuration and material sec 2 discusses these differences in detail the hanging mass fowt presents many unique design challenges of which little information is available in the existing literature and the multi body nature of the system is the primary concern multi body problems are not uncommon in the field of ocean engineering kral and kreuzer 1999 newman 2001 for example modern wave energy devices typically involve complex multi body interactions and are designed to achieve large relative motion drew et al 2009 however this behavior contradicts the desired response of a hanging mass fowt perhaps the most relatable problem to this application is maritime lifting operations liu 1973 niedzwecki and thampi 1991 hann 1995 where a suspended load is attached to a shipboard crane and subjected to wave excitation however the load is often assumed to weigh several orders of magnitude less than the ship allowing for decoupling the motions of the load from the ship therefore problems of this nature are typically analyzed using base excitation at the tip of the crane s boom however this is not the case for the hanging mass fowt where the counterweight may exceed the floater s weight so far the existing literature on the hanging mass concept is limited to a few studies of the tetraspar and the telwind platforms pereyra et al 2018 conducted a parametric study of the 10 mw tetraspar with the focus of maintaining positive tension in the suspension lines at all times here the counterweight draft was increased while decreasing the counterweight mass to find the lightest therefore cheapest system within operational constraints the system s rigid body hydrostatic stiffness was held constant by appropriately sizing the counterweight more recently a scale model of the 3 6 mw tetraspar was tested at the advanced structures and composites center s ascc alfond w2 ocean engineering laboratory w2 located at the university of maine umaine borg et al 2019 pegalajar jurado et al 2019 identified the sea state dependent damping ratios using operational modal analysis results show a clear amplitude dependence in pitch damping which is much more significant for higher sea states than the values observed during free decay tests a study by armesto et al 2018 on the telwind sought to develop an ad hoc numerical model of the system and presented the results of experimental validation results show that this numerical model was capable of accurately simulating the system s response in both regular and irregular waves more recently yang et al 2020 studied fatigue damage of the tendons using a fully coupled model consisting of incorporating openfast in an ansys aqwa analysis through a dynamic library link dll noting the limitation of commonly used numerical tools in the ability examine multi body problems such as this in particular ansys aqwa does not currently include fully coupled aero servo elastic wind turbine models and openfast does not permit multi body support structures this study concluded that wind wave coupling is critical to proper fatigue assessment showing that combined loading reduced tension fluctuations by 43 7 furthermore the exclusion of wind wave coupling reduces fatigue life estimation by 20 years this work is part of a larger research project that involves developing a suitable numerical model for this problem to address some of the current modeling limitations noted by yang et al 2020 this simplified model s formulation allows for an openfast module for multi body fowts to be developed in the future eliminating the need for complex coupling between existing codes and allowing for rapid design space exploration a detailed description of this work including model validation can be found in ward et al 2021 this paper however presents the results of a series of experiments conducted on a 1 48 scale model of a conceptual 6 mw hanging mass fowt design that makes use of post tensioned segmented concrete construction methods the results are compared to the deepcwind model tests results goupee et al 2014 koo et al 2014 to illustrate the differences between the hanging mass concept and the classical semi submersible spar and tlp designs the deepcwind tests provided some of the first data sets for fowts which often serve as a benchmark for unique designs allen et al 2019 and numerical model validation the test matrix is repeated for two different suspension systems to evaluate suspension stiffness s effect on the system s global performance the primary contributions of this work are as follows comparison between the dynamic behavior of a hanging mass fowt and three canonical examples effect of line stiffness on global system performance dynamic behavior baseline of a novel concrete hanging mass fowt design 2 model description a 1 48 scale model of a conceptual 6 mw concrete hanging mass fowt is the subject of this study the floater is assumed to comprise the hull tower wind turbine and other miscellaneous machinery the floater s base comprises four rectangular bottom beams connected using post tensioned tendons running through a keystone to form a cross a cylindrical column which supports the tower and turbine is mounted directly to the keystone and is connected to each bottom beam using a radial brace as seen in fig 1 the floater is composed of lightweight post tensioned concrete segments except the radial braces which are steel the counterweight is simply a large bucket made out of high density concrete and filled with a dense ballast such as iron ore and is open to the environment finally for the sake of simplicity a taut mooring system is used here a mooring line with a full scale extensional stiffness of 7 93 mn runs directly from the floater fairleads located at the end of each bottom beam to the basin walls or struts mounted to bridges as previously mentioned this hanging mass concept shares many similarities with the tetraspar hexafloat and telwind designs but also includes several original design features first this concept uses eight suspension lines four symmetric pairs to support the counterweight while other concepts use six suspension lines the use of six lines yields a statically determinate structure which means that there will be no relative motion between the two bodies under the condition that each line remains under tension at all times however the system will become improperly constrained and therefore unstable if a single line is lost conversely the subject of this study is over determined eight equations representing the tension in each line six unknowns representing the six degrees of freedom when eight lines make up the suspension system this redundancy adds some complexity to analysis constitutive equations are required to determine the pretension in each line but increases the design s safety factor here the system will remain stable until three lines are lost next the concept uses existing post tensioned segmented concrete technologies for assembly this construction technique combined with the use of locally sourced material and labor is expected to reduce capital expenses musial et al 2020 note that the telwind platform is also composed of concrete but uses slip forming techniques table 1 provides pertinent full scale specifications of this hanging mass concept and fig 2 provides an image of the scale model note that no turbine is visible in fig 2 previous work has shown that the global response of fowt in the wave energy frequency range is often weakly influenced by turbine dynamics goupee et al 2014 moreover wave induced motions are the primary focus of this work thus a correctly sized point mass replaces a fully operational turbine model and gross aerodynamic loads are applied electro mechanically this modeling approach is for simplicity as this research aims to understand the influence of the counterweight on the system response not the turbine multiple materials are available including steel chain and synthetic ropes that are applicable for use as suspension lines the design of which is not trivial designing any offshore mooring system requires determining fatigue performance however the need to understand the relative motion between the two bodies to minimize tension fluctuations precedes fatigue analysis the present study uses two sets of suspension lines to assess line stiffness s influence on global performance a soft system with a full scale extensional stiffness of 392 mn per line followed by a stiff system with a full scale axial stiffness of approximately 1 900 mn per line the unstretched length of each set of lines is set such that each line experiences a pretension of 5 270 kn to ensure that the counterweight s equilibrium position is the same for each case 3 environments the model described in sec 2 was subjected to an array of wave environments including six regular waves and one broadband spectrum pink noise irregular wave table 2 provides the period spread across the typical wave energy range 5 s 25 s and height of each regular wave the system s response caused by the pink noise spectrum is used to identify the system s natural frequencies and generate response amplitude operators rao table 3 lists the characteristics of the spectrum which is plotted in fig 3 along with a pink noise wave used during the deepcwind model tests note that the drop in the pink noise spectra at high periods is sharp and is softened in fig 3 due to smoothing of the spectra for plotting purposes furthermore the spectrum s period range extends beyond what is typically considered the linear wave energy range to observe the linear resonant response of the heave and pitch modes in addition to the typical linear response in the wave energy range finally a constant full scale thrust load of 850 kn is applied to the nacelle using a line connected to a servo motor constant thrust is maintained using an in line load cell regardless of the system s motion 4 results this section summarizes the experimental results of the hanging mass fowt model using the previously described environmental conditions fig 4 illustrates the floater and counterweight orientation the degrees of freedom dof and the line numbering convention relative to the wave propagation direction this orientation allows for the assumption that the sway roll and yaw motions are small since the waves propagate in the positive x direction furthermore the sway and roll raos should not be significantly different from the surge and pitch raos resulting from orthogonal waves due to the system s symmetry accordingly these results provide only the surge heave and pitch displacements of each body s center of gravity relative to the respective equilibrium position the results include comparisons between dynamic behavior of the hanging mass fowt and the deepcwind spar semi submersible and tlp platforms tested by goupee et al 2014 however there are several differences between the experimental campaigns first the deepcwind results are for a 5 mw system in contrast with the 6 mw system used in this study next the reference point for the reported data is the platform center of gravity which depends on the structure finally the deepcwind experiments used a different wave spectrum shown in fig 3 however the results provide a qualitative comparison between the hanging mass concept s behavior and the three classical concepts table 4 summarizes the relevant specifications of each deepcwind platform and a more detailed discussion may be found in goupee et al 2014 and koo et al 2014 experimental best practices including sensor calibration balancing load cells and recording each body s equilibrium position before each test case ensured the accuracy of the results sufficient time was allowed after a test for any remaining waves and motion to decay before starting the next test run a qualysis motion capture system recorded displacements and interface wmc 220n 1239 load cells measured tension in the suspension and mooring lines the motion tracking system used five above water and three below water cameras and was calibrated daily per manufacturer directions and specifications with a calibrated residual error no greater than 1 mm at model scale typically calibrated residual error values were between 0 3 mm and 0 9 mm this error was also monitored during individual runs to ensure that calibration was maintained the load cells have a reported uncertainty of 0 03 4 1 free decay results the natural periods and viscous damping coefficients were estimated using free decays tests for each suspension configuration numerical models require viscous damping coefficients for calibration while natural periods provide useful information about the system s behavior first the floater was given an initial displacement in either surge heave or pitch and held until reaching a zero velocity state by extension one may assume that the counterweight must have the same initial displacement as the floater under these conditions from here the structure is released and allowed to decay to an equilibrium position naturally the data shows that the floater and counterweight displacements are in phase acting as a single rigid body meaning that these results provide the periods and damping values for the predominately surge heave and pitch modes an alternate methodology possibly mechanical oscillation is required to excite the high frequency modes that describe relative motion between the two bodies furthermore the line stiffness only influences the high frequency modes so no change is visible in the free decay results between the soft and stiff suspension line configurations the recorded natural periods of the hanging mass fowt are reported in table 5 and compared to the deepcwind results goupee et al 2014 first the hanging mass concept s surge response falls between the upper and lower bounds set by the tlp and semi submersible the natural surge period is primarily governed by the mooring stiffness which referring back to sec 2 is not representative of a full scale system thus the implemented system fulfills the requirement of having a natural period that falls outside the wave energy range typically between 5 s and 25 s and agrees well with predicted values a more informative comparison of each platform s relative behavior is available by examining the natural heave and pitch periods the hanging mass concept s heave period is well outside of the wave energy range and closest to a spar the same can be said about the natural pitch period although the hanging mass concept and spar values are closer in value this trend is expected since the parameters that govern the hydrostatic heave waterplane area and pitch waterplane moment of area and center of gravity stiffness are similar between the two systems on the other hand the periods of the tlp and semi submersible are characteristically different this correlation suggests that a hanging mass concept might exhibit performance characteristics similar to a spar finally the damping ratios obtained for the free decay results are provided in fig 5 and compared with those obtained for the deepcwind semi submersible and spar the natural periods of the hanging mass fowt closely resemble those of the spar however the damping ratios are more in line with the semi submersible the submerged portion of the spar is slender leading to relatively low damping ratios in contrast the bottom beams and heave plates generate higher damping ratios for the hanging mass concept and semi submersible respectively particularly in heave and surge moreover the geometric similarities and experimental results indicate that the counterweight has a relatively low contribution to the total damping in heave and surge 4 2 pink noise waves here tests conducted using pink noise spectra are used to determine the linear raos and nonlinear responses and repeated for each combination of line stiffness defined in sec 2 and pink noise wave defined in table 3 the soft suspension system results are compared to the deepcwind result to demonstrate the hanging mass concept s performance relative to proven designs on the other hand the stiff system results are compared to the soft system to demonstrate the effect of the line stiffness on the system s global performance the discussion also includes a comparison with regular wave results as an indicator of nonlinear behavior 4 2 1 soft suspension linear response amplitude operators the linear position raos for both the floater and counterweight using the soft suspension system compared to the deepcwind platforms are shown in fig 6 note that the natural periods of the hanging mass concept are all outside of the linear wave excitation range as shown in table 5 leading to low linear wave induced motions between the periods of 5 s and 25 s the surge rao is shown in fig 6 a first there is a noticeable difference in the floater and counterweight surge amplitudes as expected since there is a strong coupling between floater pitch and counterweight surge the floater surge and pitch displacements are in phase with each other over the wave energy period range hence if the floater experiences a positive surge displacement in the absence of pitch then the counterweight s surge displacement will be the same however if the floater experiences pitch the counterweight will be moved in the negative surge direction thus the counterweight experiences a lower surge amplitude relative to the floater as shown in fig 6 a next a strong agreement is observable between the irregular and regular wave results which is a good indicator that other effects such as second order sum frequency loads are not significant in the range of periods shown finally the hanging mass surge results are on the same order of magnitude as the canonical deepcwind floaters agreement between the floater and the semi submersible is especially strong which is likely a result of similarities in the respective submerged geometries the submerged geometries of the semi submersible and floater of the hanging mass concept are characterized by added mass values and drag coefficients that are notably larger than the spar moving on fig 6 b provides the heave rao here the floater and counterweight heave amplitudes are nearly indistinguishable unlike the surge response indicating that relative vertical motion between the two bodies is small within the linear wave excitation range fig 7 which focuses on comparing the floater and counterweight heave raos highlights the absence of vertical level motion again the agreement between the regular and irregular waves is good and indicative of a primarily linear response the heave response of the hanging mass fowt is characteristically similar to those of the semi submersible and spar platforms note that the tlp heave response is small due to constraints provided by the tendons the natural heave periods of the semi submersible and spar see table 5 are in if not close to the linear wave excitation range and the resulting resonant response is seen in fig 6 b on the other hand the hanging mass concept s natural heave period is well outside the wave energy range and is not excited however the hanging mass fowt has a slightly higher amplitude than the semi submersible and spar due to increased wave loading on the bottom beams next the pitch rao is shown in fig 6 overall similar trends to those seen in the surge and heave responses are observable the floater and counterweight responses are nearly the same except for periods near 10 s where the floater response exceeds the counterweight which is likely a consequence of elasticity in the suspension lines and is also visible in the regular wave data again the hanging mass concept s response is similar to the semi submersible and spar up to approximately 24 s when resonance appears in the semi submersible response the hanging mass concept s and spar s natural pitch periods are very similar at 30 4 s and 31 5 s respectively interestingly the hanging mass concept s response is notably less than the spar near the natural periods at the wave energy range s upper limit indicating that the hanging mass concept is more heavily damped in pitch than the spar which is in agreement with the results shown in fig 5 finally fig 8 illustrates the rao of the suspension line tension although the configuration uses eight suspension lines only four load cells were available here lines 1 4 5 and 8 according to the convention defined in fig 4 are instrumented since they would be the first to go slack due to symmetry only the data lines 1 and 4 are present in fig 8 again the regular wave results agree with the irregular wave results the exception occurs at approximately 8 s which is also where the peak response occurs this peak coincides with the maximum relative motion between the two bodies which is visible in fig 7 these raos establish the hanging mass concept s behavior in the wave energy range and prove that the system s performance is comparable to the three canonical deepcwind floaters as previously stated the system discussed here is not optimized and represents an initial concept design however the results and comparisons shown in this paper indicate that further investigation is justifiable 4 2 2 stiff suspension linear response amplitude operators next the effect of suspension line stiffness is examined by comparing the raos for the soft and stiff suspension line configurations defined in sec 2 these results exclude the deepcwind platforms since an in depth discussion on each system s response relative to the hanging mass concept was presented in the previous section fig 9 shows the comparison between the soft and stiff position raos overall the same trends regarding an agreement with regular wave results and resonance are observable interestingly the difference between the soft and stiff results is small particularly in the surge fig 9 a and heave fig 9 b response the main observable differences occur in the pitch response shown in fig 9 c first a relatively large difference between the regular waves and irregular waves is visible at 8 33 s more explicitly the counterweight pitch determined using regular waves is notably larger than the irregular waves while a strong agreement is observable in the floater response this discrepancy is presumably indicative of nonlinear response next a large difference between the floater and counterweight response is observed in the soft configuration but is not present in the stiff condition additionally the relative response between the floater and counterweight is more significant in the stiff system than in the soft system at higher wave periods suggesting that soft systems will experience greater dynamic tension amplitudes than stiff systems at lower wave periods in comparison the inverse is true at higher wave periods next fig 10 presents a comparison between the stiff and soft line tension raos including only the tensions for lines 1 and 4 the tension raos support the conclusions drawn from the position raos primarily soft lines experience more significant tension fluctuations at low wave periods and stiff systems experience higher fluctuations at high wave periods these differences in magnitude may appear small based on the results seen in fig 10 but only one order of magnitude separates the line stiffnesses used in this study the authors anticipate that the amplitude difference would increase by using a broader range of line stiffnesses 4 2 3 response spectra the behavior of the hanging mass concept and the effect of line stiffness are investigated further by examining the power spectral density psd here the system s response spectra are generated using the pink noise wave for both the soft and stiff configurations allowing for low and high frequency responses that occur outside of the linear wave excitation range to be examined recall that a spectrum was used that covered the natural heave and pitch frequencies so that the linear resonant response of these modes could be observed in addition to the typical linear response in the wave energy range that said the comparisons do not attempt to emulate realistic cases rather they are showing the comparison of the linear response over a large range of frequencies for two different configurations the rigid body natural frequencies are well outside the wave energy range for realistic sea states and resonance will not be a large concern unless they are excited by wind loading or difference frequency loads the displacement response spectra are provided in fig 11 beginning with the surge response shown in fig 11 a a distinct peak in the counterweight response occurs at approximately 0 03 hz falling just inside the wave energy range this peak does not correspond with the natural surge frequency but rather with the natural pitch frequency due to the strong surge pitch coupling experienced by the counterweight the natural surge frequency appears as the small hump seen at approximately 0 01 hz in fig 11 a and is a result of nonlinear difference frequency wave loads the soft and stiff responses are generally the same however the stiff system experiences larger relative motion between the floater and counterweight in the vicinity of the natural pitch frequency in practice the suspension line design would mimic mooring line design practice by following the guidance of governing bodies such as the american bureau of shipping abs or dnv gl the unique differences between the hanging mass concept and conventional designs will likely require the development of similar guidelines next the heave response is shown in fig 11 b here very little difference between the floater and counterweight response for either the soft or stiff suspension configurations the peak response occurs at approximately 0 04 hz which is in the vicinity of the estimated natural heave frequency this peak is a wave induced response as the wave excitation ranges from 0 025 hz to 0 200 hz however this peak is far less distinct than those seen in the pitch response indicating that the heave response experiences relatively higher damping fig 11 c presents the pitch response where the peak response coincides with the natural pitch period at approximately 0 03 hz there is little difference between the soft and stiff systems however the relative pitch motion between the floater and counterweight is more significant in the soft system compared to the stiff system next the tension response is provided in fig 12 the peak response occurs at approximately 0 03 hz which coincides with the natural pitch frequency additionally a small but noticeable peak occurs between 0 3 hz and 0 35 hz and represents the sum frequency excitation of the high frequency modes that describe relative motion between the two bodies this response appears in the displacement responses but is less visible finally a constant thrust load is applied to the system to estimate the effect that a non zero mean pitch angle has on the system s response and fig 13 illustrates the resulting tension response first the low frequency response at 0 03 hz has is significantly lower while the high frequency response at 0 3 hz has increased additionally the stiff lines exhibit a higher response than the soft lines in the wave energy range which is a reversal from the results generated with no thrust 5 conclusions this work presents results obtained during a model test of a conceptual hanging mass fowt design primarily made of post tensioned segmented concrete this work s primary results are the linear raos of the system for two suspension configurations compared with those of the deepcwind semi submersible spar and tlp additional results include response spectra of the hanging mass concept for two suspension configurations overall the linear raos are similar to those of the deepcwind semi submersible and spar the main difference is that all of the rigid body natural periods of the hanging mass concept occur at periods outside the linear wave excitation range in contrast to the semi submersible and spar no profound difference in the displacement raos is observable between the soft and stiff suspension line configurations however slight differences are visible in the tension response where soft systems experience higher dynamic tension fluctuations at low periods and the opposite is true for high periods this difference is expected to amplify when a wider range of line stiffness is considered the response spectra agree with the raos in the linear wave excitation range and the occurrence of natural periods agrees with free decay results however two interesting observations arise first the heave response appears to experience relatively high damping levels as the resonant peak is significantly less clear than the other dofs second the tension response spectra indicate that the high frequency modes describing relative motion between the floater and counterweight may be excited presumably by second order sum frequency loads this phenomenon requires further investigation but may be similar to the high frequency springing and ringing responses experienced by tlps in conclusion this study has introduced experimental results for a hanging mass fowt which supplements the existing deepcwind data sets moreover the results indicate that the hanging mass fowt compares well with the proven semi submersible spar and tlp platforms results further suggest that using elastic cables instead of costly rigid support structures is an effective means of lowering the center of gravity thus the hanging mass fowt presents an opportunity to reduce the levelized cost of energy without sacrificing performance credit authorship contribution statement jacob c ward

20833,in the case of tidal turbine arrays the spatial evolution pattern of turbine wakes affects the power performance of other turbines and the hydrodynamic environment of adjacent turbines however the evolution mechanism is unclear particularly in terms of wake energy restoration process therefore we investigated the wake spatial evolution mechanism of a tidal current turbine experimentally the experiment used a porous disc to simulate the turbine rotor based on the equivalence principle of force an acoustic doppler velocimeter and a strain gauge measured the time varying velocities and flow loads respectively the momentum loss generated a wake zone in the downstream with enhanced turbulence originating from the boundary shear layer initially the velocity deficit in the wake core increased as the shear layer spread inwards moreover the disc blockage accelerated the flow generating high momentum transported into the wake zone however the wake expansion and turbulence dissipation were limited until the shear induced turbulence appeared at the wake centre the kinetic energy in the wake region recovered significantly in the range x 2d 3d as the wake moved downstream further energy restoration was observed in the entire wake region however the rate of energy transformation decreased beyond 7d downstream keywords tidal current turbine laboratory experiment wake spatial evolution turbulence diffusion dissipation kinetic energy restoration 1 introduction the utilisation of marine renewable energy is highly promoted by numerous governments to diversify the energy mix in comparison with the other marine renewable energies tidal current energy is frequently explored by researchers owing to its high predictability and potential for electricity production knudsen et al 2015 segura et al 2018 the tidal turbine technologies have progressed significantly over the years with reports of multiple types of tidal current turbine configurations and control methods being recognised park and law 2016 roche et al 2016 qian et al 2019 in the uk several tidal turbines with a power capacity of over 1 mw have been installed at the european marine energy centre a similar development occurred in terms of tidal energy exploration in france canada us and china hunter et al 2015 lopez et al 2020 however the tidal current energy industry is in its infancy owing to the high cost of power generation that affects its presence in the market segura et al 2017a topper et al 2019 therefore arranging multiple tidal turbines in an appropriate array is highly recommended to increase the power generation in a cost effective manner brutto et al 2017 segura et al 2017b however the energy capture process in the tidal turbines generates complex inflow structures in the turbine array the upstream turbine induces a wake zone with decreased velocity and increased turbulence intensity which reduces the extractable power and operation stability of the downstream turbines significantly chen et al 2015 vennell et al 2015 although increasing the spacing between tidal turbines can reduce the negative influence of turbine wakes the water areas suited for tidal energy extraction exist limitedly in a designated site kuo et al 2016 sutherland et al 2018 thus the hydrodynamic impact of tidal turbine wakes affects the performance of a turbine array critically when the negative impact is reduced and the performance is acceptable the tidal turbine arrays can be operated commercially numerical models are widely employed to predict the spatial evolution processes in tidal turbine wakes particularly in the case of large scale turbine farms dou et al 2019 yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020a the tidal turbines are simulated using various methods such as the actuator line method actuator disc approach and momentum sink term apsley et al 2018 li et al 2017 o doherty et al 2009 shives and crawford 2017 these methods assess the velocity changes in the vicinity of a tidal turbine and predict the wake velocity deficit and its recovery process additionally the wake zone is characterised by elevated turbulence owing to the velocity difference in the shear layers and disturbance from the blade rotations and support structures vinod and banerjee 2019 liu et al 2020 the wake turbulence is simulated by coupling the modified reynolds averaged navier stokes equations large eddy simulation etc baratchi et al 2017 li et al 2020 roc et al 2013 however the inherent relationship between wake evolution and turbulence diffusion is unclear most laboratory experiments have investigated the wake characteristics of an individual tidal turbine stallard et al 2013 measured the wake velocities on the central axes behind a turbine and reported the wake velocity profiles in both the horizontal and vertical directions tedds et al 2014 studied the near wake region characteristics and identified that the turbulence is significantly anisotropic this anisotropic nature of wake turbulence and asymmetry in the wake flow were demonstrated by ouro et al 2019 in a vertical axis turbine experiment additionally they reported that the flow skewness is maintained beyond 10 rotor diameters 10d despite the wake velocity recovering primarily at 5d behind the turbine furthermore chen et al 2017 reported the secondary flow motion caused by the turbine rotation in the near wake and the three dimensional wake structures which includes both wake velocity and turbulence intensity vinod and banerjee 2019 studied the effect of inflow turbulence intensity on the wake characteristics and reported that the elevated inflow turbulence accelerates the wake velocity recovery and shear induced turbulence diffusion these experiments primarily investigate the structural characteristics of wake velocity and turbulence however only a few studies link the wake velocity recovery with the wake turbulence diffusion process to understand the wake spatial evolution mechanism thoroughly moreover the restoration of wake energy in terms of energy transformation in the wake evolution process is not explored completely thus far the details of the kinetic energy transformation from the ambient flow to the wake region remain unclear to address this gap we performed a series of laboratory experiments to investigate the wake evolution and re energization processes although accurate scaling of turbine properties is technically challenging and may cause exaggerated variations in the downstream flow nash and phoenix 2017 zhang et al 2021a a porous disc can avoid certain challenges in modelling a small scale turbine despite its limitations in comprehending the actual wake properties moreover several numerical models utilise the actuator disc approach or the momentum sink term to simulate the turbine wake especially for wake interactions in large scale turbine farms thus the results obtained from the porous disc testing can provide detailed data for the numerical models according to the force equivalence principle myers and bahaj 2012 a porous disc represents a flow axis turbine rotor the flow loads and time varying velocities downstream are measured accurately to determine the hydrodynamic performance and wake evolution properties respectively the experimental analysis determined the inherent relationship between wake velocity recovery and shear induced turbulence diffusion dissipation additionally the study explains the kinetic energy transformation mechanism from the ambient flow to the wake zone in the process of wake spatial evolution the remainder of this paper is organised as follows section 2 describes the experimental setup inflow characterisation and hydrodynamic performance evaluation section 3 presents the wake spatial evolution and shear induced turbulence diffusion dissipation processes section 4 explains the momentum transfer and kinetic energy transformation between the wake zone and ambient flow in the wake energy restoration process section 5 discusses the wake evolution mechanism turbine arrangement optimisation and the purpose of a disc in investigating the wake properties of a tidal turbine rotor finally section 6 presents the conclusions of the study 2 laboratory experiment we performed the experiments in a flume to investigate the wake spatial evolution mechanism behind a tidal turbine represented as a porous disc this section presents the experimental arrangement and the measurement facilities designed to obtain the flow properties and thrust values 2 1 experimental setup fig 1 depicts the circulating water flume used in the experiment the flume is 40 m long 3 5 m wide and 0 5 m deep with a horizontal bed constructed using toughened glass panels the test section is located in the middle reach of the flume where in the width is narrowed to 2 1 m to increase the flow speed the water discharge is controlled by a pumping system placed beneath the flume an underground reservoir is connected to the flume via pipes to enable the circulation of water additionally a stainless steel grid is fixed at the flume inlet to break large scale eddies from the reservoir consequently the distribution of the flow and turbulence intensity in the cross section are maintained predominantly uniform furthermore a tail gate is installed at the flume outlet to control the water level the analysis is performed using a right handed coordinate system wherein x y and z indicate the flow direction width of the flume and the vertical direction with positive values upwards respectively the porous disc comprises 156 identical sized holes and the distribution of the holes is circumferentially uniform fig 2 to avoid the effects of any non uniformity on the wake properties the porous disc is 0 006 m thick and fabricated using polyvinyl chloride a high stiffness material to ensure minimum deformation as the flow passes through the disc the diameters of the disc and holes are 0 15 m and 0 0075 m respectively the disc porosity is the ratio of the void area to the disc area which is calculated as 0 39 as depicted in fig 2 a cylindrical steel pole fixed on the framework above a bridge supports the disc the disc is located at the central axis of the flume which is 20 m downstream the flume inlet the disc centre is 0 1 m above the flume bed in the test section the cross section width and water depth are 14d and 1 4d respectively according to the literature when the blockage ratio is greater than 10 the performance of a tidal turbine improves significantly owing to the acceleration of the water flow kolekar and banerjee 2015 schluntz and willden 2015 however the blockage ratio of the disc in this study is approximately 4 therefore we obtained the blockage correction coefficient for the flow thrust based on the methods proposed by bahaj et al 2007a and whelan et al 2009 the corrected thrust coefficient c t c t measure 0 93 2 2 velocity measurement the upper and lower edges of the porous disc are located 0 035 m vertically below the water surface and 0 025 m above the flume floor respectively to capture the details of hydrodynamic processes around the wake boundary the time varying velocities are measured using a side looking acoustic doppler velocimeter adv we tested the signal to noise ratio snr and correlation coefficient cor prior to each set of measurements to ensure high data quality initially the values of snr and cor were greater than 15 db and approximately 85 respectively we added small plastic particles to the water to increase the particle concentration as the specific gravity of plastic 1 03 is close to that of the water the plastic particles flow with the water effortlessly thus the values of snr and cor increased to 20 db and 90 respectively in nearly all the velocity samples collected during the experiment the adv is fastened to a vertical pole fixed on a two dimensional traverser and is capable of moving both horizontally and vertically while measuring the velocities automatically at each cross section the velocities are measured at eight cross sections along the flow direction within a distance of 10d downstream the disc we collected 527 31 17 velocity samples at each cross section with the lateral and vertical intervals being 0 02 m and 0 01 m respectively velocity data are recorded for over 30 s at a frequency of 150 hz at each point to ensure reliable measurements of time varying velocity and reynolds stress distributions voulgaris and trowbridge 1998 the level of flow turbulence is obtained based on the turbulence intensity wherein the longitudinal component of the turbulence intensity ti x is calculated as 1 t i x 1 n i 1 n u i u i u i u i u 100 the momentum transfer is influenced by the reynolds shear stress during wake mixing tedds et al 2014 ahmadi and yang 2020 the reynolds shear stress r xy in the x y plane is defined as 2 r x y 1 n i 1 n u i u i v i v i u where n is the number of time varying velocity samples u i and v i are the time varying velocities in the longitudinal and transverse directions respectively u i and v i are the time averaged velocities in the longitudinal and transverse directions respectively and u is the mean velocity over the disc swept area the remaining values of turbulence intensities ti y ti z and reynolds shear stress r yz r zx are calculated in a similar manner 2 3 inflow characterisation the time varying velocities at the disc cross section are measured before the disc installation fig 3 a illustrates the time averaged longitudinal velocity profiles along the water depth the mean vertical velocity profiles follow the log law and are predominantly uniform in the transverse direction in the region y 0 08 m 0 08 m additionally the mean longitudinal velocity at the height of the disc centre is 0 24 m s and the corresponding reynolds number re 5 04 10 4 as depicted in fig 3 b the longitudinal turbulence intensity profiles are predominantly linear along the water depth the higher and lower turbulence intensity values close to the flume bed and water surface are approximately 12 and 5 respectively 2 4 hydrodynamic performance assessment the flow load on the disc support system is measured using a micro strain gauge with a dynamometer module connected to a computer the measurement accuracy is within 0 2 of the load as depicted in fig 2 the strain gauge is mounted on a platform and connected to the support shaft using an adjustable nut and the loading location is 0 87 m above the disc centre the disc support system rotates around a horizontal shaft freely when the flow load is applied to the system a spirit level maintains the support system vertical and ensures that the disc swept area is orthogonal to the x direction the flow force on the support system is determined using the lever principle as the lower part of the support system is immersed in water the flow force measured by the strain gauge comprises both the flow thrust on the disc swept area and the drag on the support shaft furthermore the flow force is measured with and without the porous disc for 600 s at a frequency of 5 hz using a dynamic strain gauge we observed that the flow loads on the support system fluctuate with time fig 4 the averaged load values with and without the disc are 0 61 n and 0 10 n and the corresponding standard deviations are 0 04 n and 0 003 n respectively thus the average thrust coefficient c t of the disc is 0 99 with a standard deviation of 0 08 as mentioned in section 2 1 the blockage corrected thrust coefficient c t is 0 92 thus the axial flow induction factor is obtained as 0 36 based on the momentum theory burton et al 2011 the maximum value of the equivalent power coefficient for a turbine rotor is referred to as the lanchester betz limit which occurs when the axial flow induction factor is 1 3 and the corresponding thrust coefficient is 0 89 this implies that the disc porosity in this experiment is smaller than the optimal one generating an enlarged blockage effect for the flow passing through the disc 3 wake spatial evolution 3 1 wake velocity deficit fig 5 depicts the velocity recovery process behind the porous disc at 1d downstream the wake zone is approximately 1 5 times the disc swept area the flow velocity reduces abruptly as the flow passes through the disc generating a wake core of size similar to the disc swept area the maximum velocity deficit in the wake core is 87 6 at x 1d owing to the momentum loss the velocity deficit in the wake core is associated with the thrust coefficient which is primarily determined by the disc porosity however the velocity deficit behind the disc is not a function of disc porosity alone as the thrust coefficient is influenced by the size and number of disc holes as well myers and bahaj 2010 the small size of the pores in this study produces a high thrust coefficient and large velocity deficit downstream a shear layer occurs between the wake core and free flow at x 1d the thickness of the shear layer is approximately 0 25d and the radial distribution of the velocity deficit in the shear layer is approximately linear see fig 6 a at 2d downstream the shear layer spreads towards the wake core with limited outward expansion and the wake size is nearly identical to that of 1d downstream fig 5 however the maximum velocity deficit in the wake core increases to 91 0 at x 2d at this stage a further momentum loss occurs in the wake core owing to the pressure recovery caused by the significant decrease in water pressure as the flow passes through the disc a similar wake recovery pattern was observed in a model turbine experiment reported by mycek et al 2014 thus the velocity deficit gradient attenuates in the shear layer with the velocity deficit profiles turning less regular the flow bypassing the disc is accelerated and the velocity increments up to 28 4 at 1d downstream however it nearly recovers to the ambient flow at x 3d fig 6 at this stage a significant reduction in the velocity deficit in the wake core and limited wake expansion occur simultaneously the high momentum transported into the wake zone originates from the accelerated bypassing flow particularly below the disc centre fig 5 subsequently the wake zone expands in both vertical and transverse directions and the wake edge turns increasingly irregular however the vertical wake expansion is limited by both the water surface and flume bed thus the wake centre moves vertically upwards beyond 3d downstream and a faster wake recovery occurs in the downward direction owing to the greater inflow turbulence close to the flume bed fig 3b for a wide channel the wake lateral expansion is relatively free and the expansion rate relies on the turbulence intensity of the ambient flow at x 5 5d the width of the wake zone is approximately twice the disc diameter further downstream the wake centre continues to move upwards and the wake zone expands laterally as the velocity recovers further 3 2 shear induced turbulence diffusion and dissipation tidal energy extraction by tidal turbines decreases the wake velocity and increases the turbulence intensity the wake turbulence is induced by the shear around the wake edge and disturbance from the turbine blades nacelle and tower the turbulence generated by the turbine structure decays rapidly causing substantial heat dissipation within the near wake region stallard et al 2015 3 2 1 longitudinal turbulence the wake turbulence is primarily generated in the shear layer around the wake core fig 7 at 1d downstream high turbulence intensity is observed primarily in the wake boundary whereas it is equivalent to the low intensity of ambient flow in the wake core region this implies that the kinetic energy loss generates from other mechanical energy transformation rather than the wake turbulence generation although the velocity gradient is predominantly uniform the longitudinal turbulence intensity is non uniform in the shear layer therefore a higher turbulence intensity is observed in the upper half of the shear layer with a maximum intensity of 29 5 however the turbulence intensity gradient is high outside the shear layer and the gradient towards the ambient flow differs from that observed at the wake core initially the strong turbulence in the shear layer diffuses towards the wake core with limited outward diffusion in comparison with the velocity deficit distribution the shear induced turbulence spreads faster inwards at 3d downstream the high intensity turbulence envelops the entire wake region before spreading outwards the attenuation of wake turbulence primarily involves the diffusion and dissipation processes as indicated in fig 7 limited turbulent energy dissipation occurs before the diffusion of shear induced turbulence into the entire wake zone 1 3d at x 4d the turbulence diffuses outwards and the gradient of the turbulence intensity reduces in the entire wake region however the wake turbulence zone expansion is limited further downstream in the vertical direction owing to the shallow water depth the turbulence intensity distribution increases in irregularity as the wake turbulence dissipates further as depicted in fig 7 8 5 10d the dissipation process is faster near the flume bed owing to the large turbulence intensity of the downward inflow along the water depth moreover the wake turbulence area enlarges in the upward direction along the water depth and the turbulence zone separates into two parts from the bottom 3 2 2 transverse and vertical turbulence the shear induced turbulence is generated by the interaction between the slow moving wake flow and the fast moving bypass flow although this has been studied to a certain extent the existing literature on wake turbulence does not explore the transverse and vertical components of the turbulence in detail myers and bahaj 2010 vinod and banerjee 2019 ahmadi and yang 2020 in comparison with the intensity of the longitudinal turbulence that of the transverse turbulence is significantly lower in the wake region however the vertical intensity is significantly higher fig 8 at x 1d the distribution of vertical turbulence intensity in the shear layer is anisotropic with the peak value of 35 5 which is substantially higher than the transverse and longitudinal turbulence intensities this phenomenon can be attributed to the flow separation at the disc edge however further investigations on the variations in vertical velocity are needed at the initial stage of wake evolution the diffusion processes of the transverse and vertical turbulence are similar to that of the longitudinal turbulence in other words the shear induced turbulence flow spreads into the wake core with minimal outward diffusion as it envelops the entire wake zone with a predominantly uniform turbulence intensity at x 3d thereafter the dissipation processes differ the transverse turbulence dissipates below the wake centre rapidly and the region of high turbulence intensity moves in the upward direction as it spreads towards the two lateral sides conversely rapid dissipation of vertical turbulence is observed in the lower area with limited diffusion outwards the details of the transverse and vertical turbulence diffusion and dissipation are presented in appendices c and d respectively 4 reynolds shear stress and wake energy restoration 4 1 reynolds shear stress typically the reynolds shear stress r xy in the process of wake energy restoration transports the high momentum from the ambient flow to the wake zone tedds et al 2014 ahmadi and yang 2020 the reynolds shear stress in the x y plane r xy is generated from the shear layer at the wake edge however the wake core generates minimal shear stress fig 9 at 1d downstream significant r xy is observed at the two lateral sides of the wake core with the shear stress on the right hand side y 0 0 m greater than that of the left hand side y 0 0 m as the wake expands downstream the shear stress r xy spreads towards both the wake core and the ambient flow with a lower outward spreading speed than that of the inward spreading in the range of 1 2d downstream the momentum is transported from the bypass flow into the wake zone and the velocity deficit is recovered from the wake edge and the centre consecutively fig 5 at x 3d the value of r xy increases higher than the peak value observed at x 1d this implies that the rapid wake energy restoration occurs as the shear stress envelops the wake region completely however the reynolds shear stress weakens around y 0 moreover the r xy value attenuates beyond 3d downstream in the longitudinal direction at this stage the high shear stress zone spreads moderately outwards and gradually separates towards the two lateral sides at x 8 5d the shear stress zone separates into two completely isolated zones with irregular distribution of r xy and exhibits a lateral expansion towards the water surface fig 10 depicts the distribution of reynolds shear stress in the y z plane r yz in comparison with r xy the value of r yz is small in the shear layer at 1d downstream the profile of r yz in the shear layer is inhomogeneous large r yz is observed primarily on the left hand side y 0 0 m of the wake core whereas it is less regular on the right hand side y 0 0 m the high shear stress zone spreads inwards with the longitudinal distance however it does not envelop the entire wake region the value of r yz decreases rapidly in the near wake region particularly at lower areas beyond 4d downstream the average value of r yz is negligible the shear stress r zx is significant in the upper half of the shear layer downstream as depicted in fig 11 r zx is approximately 0 2 at x 1d which is greater than the peak value of r xy in the wake zone this implies that the momentum transfer in the z x plane is more intense than that of the x y plane however the momentum transfer in the z x plane primarily occurs in the local region above the wake centre with increasing distance r zx attenuates rapidly and spreads primarily towards the wake centre the shear stress r zx reduces to 0 16 at 3d downstream as it envelops half of the wake region above the wake centre furthermore significant attenuation is observed in the shear stress at x 4d and it attains the level of the ambient flow further downstream 4 2 wake energy restoration the wake flow is characterised by decreased flow velocity and increased turbulence intensity in the wake spatial evolution process the wake zone expands towards the two lateral sides while the hydrodynamic properties remain almost uninfluenced by the wake beyond the region y 2d 2d therefore the kinetic energy transformation during wake evolution is investigated within the region y 2d 2d the total kinetic energy e k in the region y 2d 2d is calculated as 3 e k e k w e k a where e kw and e ka are defined as a w 1 2 ρ u w 2 e d a w and a a 1 2 ρ u a 2 e d a a respectively similarly the total turbulent energy e t in the region y 2d 2d is calculated as 4 e t e t w e t a where e tw and e ta are defined as a w 1 2 ρ t i w u 2 e d a w and a a 1 2 ρ t i a u 2 e d a a respectively in equations 3 and 4 the subscripts w and a represent the wake flow and ambient flow respectively ρ denotes the water density a and u represent the flow area and mean inflow velocity respectively e determines the inflow energy using a 1 2 ρ u 2 1 2 ρ ti u 2 d a and ti denotes the turbulence intensity the area where the velocity deficit occurs represents the wake area while the remaining area in the region y 2d 2d is considered as the ambient flow area the wake flow area increases owing to the wake expansion whereas the ambient flow area reduces with wake evolution the values calculated using equations 3 and 4 are nondimensionalised by dividing the inflow energy e over the region y 2d 2d to evaluate the variations in the kinetic and turbulent energies during the wake evolution process the kinetic and turbulent energies are calculated at each cross section in the range x 1d 10d fig 12 initially the values of e kw e ka e tw and e ta at each cross section are divided into 527 subdomains and initialised subsequently a program file reads the data of velocity u turbulence intensity ti flow area a and velocity deficit of each subdomain the velocity deficit estimates the value of the subdomain and the subdomain is a part of either the wake flow or the ambient flow region depending on whether the value is negative or positive respectively furthermore the kinetic and turbulent energies are calculated in the subdomain followed by the iterative summation to determine the energies in the wake flow or the ambient flow region the aforementioned steps are repeated to determine all the subdomains finally the results of e kw e ka e tw and e ta are added to obtain the values of e k and e t using equations 3 and 4 respectively fig 13 a illustrates the variations in the total kinetic energy wake kinetic energy and ambient flow kinetic energy in the range x 1d 10d similarly fig 13 b illustrates the variations in the total turbulent energy wake turbulent energy and ambient flow turbulent energy at x 1d the total kinetic energy is 86 9 and the kinetic energy loss is 13 1 in the very near wake region which is caused by the mechanical energy transformation and turbulence generation seo et al 2016 the turbulent energy in the wake zone is 3 0 and a significant energy loss that accounts to approximately 23 of the kinetic energy loss is observed owing to the wake turbulence the remaining kinetic energy losses are transformed into other types of energy as the flow passes through the disc at 2d downstream the kinetic energy in the wake zone is marginally greater than that of 1d consequently the amount of kinetic energy decreased in the ambient flow this decrement is marginally less than the increment of the wake kinetic energy furthermore the kinetic energy in the region x 2d 3d increases and decreases by 11 9 and 16 8 in the wake region and the ambient flow respectively the wake re energization and the remaining kinetic energy loss increase the low pressure in the wake moreover the shear layer in the range 1 3d downstream diffuses towards the wake centre significantly with limited turbulent energy dissipation the turbulent energy reduces in the wake zone from 3d to 4d downstream however the kinetic energy from both the ambient flow and wake zone increases slightly this increment could be attributed to the decrease in water level however further experiments are necessary to confirm the variations in energy additionally the kinetic energy in the wake region increases further whereas that of the ambient flow decreases owing to the wake expansion the red line in fig 13 a indicates the increase pattern of kinetic energy in the wake region which is non linear in the flow direction with a slow increase rate beyond 7d downstream the kinetic energy increment in the wake flow is equivalent to the decrement of ambient flow in the range 5 5 10d however the turbulent energy in the wake region dissipates continuously with a gradual decrease in the dissipation rate fig 13b 5 discussion in this study a porous disc is used to approximately represent the turbine rotor based on the force equivalence principle using the porous disc does have limitations for example the wake swirl and vortices induced by turbine rotor cannot be simulated by the static disc the differences mainly appear in the near wake within 4d downstream myers and bahaj 2010 nash and phoenix 2017 the flow structure of the near wake behind the turbine may be more complex than that behind porous disc the wake swirl and boundary layer could affect the momentum transfer in the process of near wake evolution zhang et al 2021b which should be further studied compared with the model turbine experiments morandi et al 2016 seo et al 2016 the amount of kinetic energy loss caused by wake turbulence is much larger just behind disc in the process of near wake evolution the high momentum initially comes from the accelerated flow caused by the blockage effect in the range 1 2d the kinetic energy increment in the wake zone is larger than the kinetic energy decrement in the ambient flow moreover the energy supply is attributed to the potential energy conversion owing to the decrease in water level fallon et al 2014 ramos et al 2013 however the experimental data on the free surface variations obtained from the existing studies are limited in our experiment the shallow water depth increases the blockage ratio in the vertical direction and enhances the vertical components of the reynolds shear stress and shear induced turbulence additionally the corresponding momentum transfer driven by the reynolds shear stress is highly intense in the x z plane before the shear layer reaches the wake centre the turbulent energy in the wake region increases continuously within the 3d region this implies that the kinetic energy of the ambient flow is utilised to enhance the wake turbulence however the energy loss from the ambient flow is not equivalent to the increment in the wake zone energy when only the kinetic and turbulent energies are considered this is because the local pressure in the wake zone reduces as the flow passes through the turbine burton et al 2011 zangiabadi et al 2017 and the pressure recovery can utilise the kinetic energy from the ambient flow as the measurement of wake pressure is challenging the process of wake pressure recovery cannot be understood completely with this limited data moreover the wake turbulence is enhanced owing to the tip vortex shedding and the disturbance from the turbine nacelle tower and support system zhang et al 2020b however the turbulence may affect the wake energy restoration in the near wake region limitedly as it dissipates almost completely within 1d downstream stallard et al 2015 according to bahaj et al 2007b the properties of the far wake region behind the porous disc can be associated with that of a scaled turbine rotor in this scenario the momentum transfer primarily occurs in the x y plane and the high momentum transported into the wake zone primarily generates from the ambient flow around the lateral sides the kinetic energy from the ambient flow is not utilised entirely to recover the wake flow which results in an energy loss in addition the turbulent energy dissipates as the turbulence zone diffuses outwards thus the wake kinetic energy cannot recover completely to the inflow condition the experimental data obtained from this study can be used to design turbine arrays in an aligned layout the downstream turbines must not be located within the 3d region as their stability can be affected by the shear induced turbulence with limited dissipation we demonstrated that the turbulent energy attenuates while the kinetic energy increases further in the range of 4 7d within the wake region therefore the turbine performance can be improved by placing the turbines in an aligned array beyond 7d downstream moreover the wake zone expands laterally attaining a width of up to 2d at 5 5d downstream therefore to obtain a staggered layout the turbines can be located within 5 5d downstream or further upstream to capture the accelerated bypass flow and avoid the negative effects of the merging of individual wakes however the wake hydrodynamics in a staggered array is complex owing to the wake interaction if the spacing between turbines is small the wake evolution process may be affected therefore further investigations are needed to determine the wake interactions and optimise the turbine array layout 6 conclusions we performed laboratory experiments to study the hydrodynamic mechanism of the wake spatial evolution and kinetic energy restoration the following conclusions can be drawn from the experimental results 1 the wake velocity decreases rapidly owing to the momentum loss the turbulence level is elevated significantly in the shear layer around the wake core and the energy utilised by the turbulence accounts for a large percentage of the kinetic energy loss 2 at the initial stage of wake evolution the boundary shear layer spreads into the wake core with limited wake expansion and turbulence dissipation however the flow velocity recovers significantly as the shear induced turbulence reaches the wake centre followed by significant wake expansion and turbulence dissipation 3 the momentum transfer in the z x plane is substantially stronger than that in the x y plane in the near wake region conversely it is primarily in the x y plane further downstream owing to the attenuation of the reynolds shear stress r zx close to the ambient flow level beyond 4d downstream moreover the mechanical energy loss occurs primarily in the region 2 3d during the wake energy restoration process credit author statement none declaration of

20833,in the case of tidal turbine arrays the spatial evolution pattern of turbine wakes affects the power performance of other turbines and the hydrodynamic environment of adjacent turbines however the evolution mechanism is unclear particularly in terms of wake energy restoration process therefore we investigated the wake spatial evolution mechanism of a tidal current turbine experimentally the experiment used a porous disc to simulate the turbine rotor based on the equivalence principle of force an acoustic doppler velocimeter and a strain gauge measured the time varying velocities and flow loads respectively the momentum loss generated a wake zone in the downstream with enhanced turbulence originating from the boundary shear layer initially the velocity deficit in the wake core increased as the shear layer spread inwards moreover the disc blockage accelerated the flow generating high momentum transported into the wake zone however the wake expansion and turbulence dissipation were limited until the shear induced turbulence appeared at the wake centre the kinetic energy in the wake region recovered significantly in the range x 2d 3d as the wake moved downstream further energy restoration was observed in the entire wake region however the rate of energy transformation decreased beyond 7d downstream keywords tidal current turbine laboratory experiment wake spatial evolution turbulence diffusion dissipation kinetic energy restoration 1 introduction the utilisation of marine renewable energy is highly promoted by numerous governments to diversify the energy mix in comparison with the other marine renewable energies tidal current energy is frequently explored by researchers owing to its high predictability and potential for electricity production knudsen et al 2015 segura et al 2018 the tidal turbine technologies have progressed significantly over the years with reports of multiple types of tidal current turbine configurations and control methods being recognised park and law 2016 roche et al 2016 qian et al 2019 in the uk several tidal turbines with a power capacity of over 1 mw have been installed at the european marine energy centre a similar development occurred in terms of tidal energy exploration in france canada us and china hunter et al 2015 lopez et al 2020 however the tidal current energy industry is in its infancy owing to the high cost of power generation that affects its presence in the market segura et al 2017a topper et al 2019 therefore arranging multiple tidal turbines in an appropriate array is highly recommended to increase the power generation in a cost effective manner brutto et al 2017 segura et al 2017b however the energy capture process in the tidal turbines generates complex inflow structures in the turbine array the upstream turbine induces a wake zone with decreased velocity and increased turbulence intensity which reduces the extractable power and operation stability of the downstream turbines significantly chen et al 2015 vennell et al 2015 although increasing the spacing between tidal turbines can reduce the negative influence of turbine wakes the water areas suited for tidal energy extraction exist limitedly in a designated site kuo et al 2016 sutherland et al 2018 thus the hydrodynamic impact of tidal turbine wakes affects the performance of a turbine array critically when the negative impact is reduced and the performance is acceptable the tidal turbine arrays can be operated commercially numerical models are widely employed to predict the spatial evolution processes in tidal turbine wakes particularly in the case of large scale turbine farms dou et al 2019 yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020a the tidal turbines are simulated using various methods such as the actuator line method actuator disc approach and momentum sink term apsley et al 2018 li et al 2017 o doherty et al 2009 shives and crawford 2017 these methods assess the velocity changes in the vicinity of a tidal turbine and predict the wake velocity deficit and its recovery process additionally the wake zone is characterised by elevated turbulence owing to the velocity difference in the shear layers and disturbance from the blade rotations and support structures vinod and banerjee 2019 liu et al 2020 the wake turbulence is simulated by coupling the modified reynolds averaged navier stokes equations large eddy simulation etc baratchi et al 2017 li et al 2020 roc et al 2013 however the inherent relationship between wake evolution and turbulence diffusion is unclear most laboratory experiments have investigated the wake characteristics of an individual tidal turbine stallard et al 2013 measured the wake velocities on the central axes behind a turbine and reported the wake velocity profiles in both the horizontal and vertical directions tedds et al 2014 studied the near wake region characteristics and identified that the turbulence is significantly anisotropic this anisotropic nature of wake turbulence and asymmetry in the wake flow were demonstrated by ouro et al 2019 in a vertical axis turbine experiment additionally they reported that the flow skewness is maintained beyond 10 rotor diameters 10d despite the wake velocity recovering primarily at 5d behind the turbine furthermore chen et al 2017 reported the secondary flow motion caused by the turbine rotation in the near wake and the three dimensional wake structures which includes both wake velocity and turbulence intensity vinod and banerjee 2019 studied the effect of inflow turbulence intensity on the wake characteristics and reported that the elevated inflow turbulence accelerates the wake velocity recovery and shear induced turbulence diffusion these experiments primarily investigate the structural characteristics of wake velocity and turbulence however only a few studies link the wake velocity recovery with the wake turbulence diffusion process to understand the wake spatial evolution mechanism thoroughly moreover the restoration of wake energy in terms of energy transformation in the wake evolution process is not explored completely thus far the details of the kinetic energy transformation from the ambient flow to the wake region remain unclear to address this gap we performed a series of laboratory experiments to investigate the wake evolution and re energization processes although accurate scaling of turbine properties is technically challenging and may cause exaggerated variations in the downstream flow nash and phoenix 2017 zhang et al 2021a a porous disc can avoid certain challenges in modelling a small scale turbine despite its limitations in comprehending the actual wake properties moreover several numerical models utilise the actuator disc approach or the momentum sink term to simulate the turbine wake especially for wake interactions in large scale turbine farms thus the results obtained from the porous disc testing can provide detailed data for the numerical models according to the force equivalence principle myers and bahaj 2012 a porous disc represents a flow axis turbine rotor the flow loads and time varying velocities downstream are measured accurately to determine the hydrodynamic performance and wake evolution properties respectively the experimental analysis determined the inherent relationship between wake velocity recovery and shear induced turbulence diffusion dissipation additionally the study explains the kinetic energy transformation mechanism from the ambient flow to the wake zone in the process of wake spatial evolution the remainder of this paper is organised as follows section 2 describes the experimental setup inflow characterisation and hydrodynamic performance evaluation section 3 presents the wake spatial evolution and shear induced turbulence diffusion dissipation processes section 4 explains the momentum transfer and kinetic energy transformation between the wake zone and ambient flow in the wake energy restoration process section 5 discusses the wake evolution mechanism turbine arrangement optimisation and the purpose of a disc in investigating the wake properties of a tidal turbine rotor finally section 6 presents the conclusions of the study 2 laboratory experiment we performed the experiments in a flume to investigate the wake spatial evolution mechanism behind a tidal turbine represented as a porous disc this section presents the experimental arrangement and the measurement facilities designed to obtain the flow properties and thrust values 2 1 experimental setup fig 1 depicts the circulating water flume used in the experiment the flume is 40 m long 3 5 m wide and 0 5 m deep with a horizontal bed constructed using toughened glass panels the test section is located in the middle reach of the flume where in the width is narrowed to 2 1 m to increase the flow speed the water discharge is controlled by a pumping system placed beneath the flume an underground reservoir is connected to the flume via pipes to enable the circulation of water additionally a stainless steel grid is fixed at the flume inlet to break large scale eddies from the reservoir consequently the distribution of the flow and turbulence intensity in the cross section are maintained predominantly uniform furthermore a tail gate is installed at the flume outlet to control the water level the analysis is performed using a right handed coordinate system wherein x y and z indicate the flow direction width of the flume and the vertical direction with positive values upwards respectively the porous disc comprises 156 identical sized holes and the distribution of the holes is circumferentially uniform fig 2 to avoid the effects of any non uniformity on the wake properties the porous disc is 0 006 m thick and fabricated using polyvinyl chloride a high stiffness material to ensure minimum deformation as the flow passes through the disc the diameters of the disc and holes are 0 15 m and 0 0075 m respectively the disc porosity is the ratio of the void area to the disc area which is calculated as 0 39 as depicted in fig 2 a cylindrical steel pole fixed on the framework above a bridge supports the disc the disc is located at the central axis of the flume which is 20 m downstream the flume inlet the disc centre is 0 1 m above the flume bed in the test section the cross section width and water depth are 14d and 1 4d respectively according to the literature when the blockage ratio is greater than 10 the performance of a tidal turbine improves significantly owing to the acceleration of the water flow kolekar and banerjee 2015 schluntz and willden 2015 however the blockage ratio of the disc in this study is approximately 4 therefore we obtained the blockage correction coefficient for the flow thrust based on the methods proposed by bahaj et al 2007a and whelan et al 2009 the corrected thrust coefficient c t c t measure 0 93 2 2 velocity measurement the upper and lower edges of the porous disc are located 0 035 m vertically below the water surface and 0 025 m above the flume floor respectively to capture the details of hydrodynamic processes around the wake boundary the time varying velocities are measured using a side looking acoustic doppler velocimeter adv we tested the signal to noise ratio snr and correlation coefficient cor prior to each set of measurements to ensure high data quality initially the values of snr and cor were greater than 15 db and approximately 85 respectively we added small plastic particles to the water to increase the particle concentration as the specific gravity of plastic 1 03 is close to that of the water the plastic particles flow with the water effortlessly thus the values of snr and cor increased to 20 db and 90 respectively in nearly all the velocity samples collected during the experiment the adv is fastened to a vertical pole fixed on a two dimensional traverser and is capable of moving both horizontally and vertically while measuring the velocities automatically at each cross section the velocities are measured at eight cross sections along the flow direction within a distance of 10d downstream the disc we collected 527 31 17 velocity samples at each cross section with the lateral and vertical intervals being 0 02 m and 0 01 m respectively velocity data are recorded for over 30 s at a frequency of 150 hz at each point to ensure reliable measurements of time varying velocity and reynolds stress distributions voulgaris and trowbridge 1998 the level of flow turbulence is obtained based on the turbulence intensity wherein the longitudinal component of the turbulence intensity ti x is calculated as 1 t i x 1 n i 1 n u i u i u i u i u 100 the momentum transfer is influenced by the reynolds shear stress during wake mixing tedds et al 2014 ahmadi and yang 2020 the reynolds shear stress r xy in the x y plane is defined as 2 r x y 1 n i 1 n u i u i v i v i u where n is the number of time varying velocity samples u i and v i are the time varying velocities in the longitudinal and transverse directions respectively u i and v i are the time averaged velocities in the longitudinal and transverse directions respectively and u is the mean velocity over the disc swept area the remaining values of turbulence intensities ti y ti z and reynolds shear stress r yz r zx are calculated in a similar manner 2 3 inflow characterisation the time varying velocities at the disc cross section are measured before the disc installation fig 3 a illustrates the time averaged longitudinal velocity profiles along the water depth the mean vertical velocity profiles follow the log law and are predominantly uniform in the transverse direction in the region y 0 08 m 0 08 m additionally the mean longitudinal velocity at the height of the disc centre is 0 24 m s and the corresponding reynolds number re 5 04 10 4 as depicted in fig 3 b the longitudinal turbulence intensity profiles are predominantly linear along the water depth the higher and lower turbulence intensity values close to the flume bed and water surface are approximately 12 and 5 respectively 2 4 hydrodynamic performance assessment the flow load on the disc support system is measured using a micro strain gauge with a dynamometer module connected to a computer the measurement accuracy is within 0 2 of the load as depicted in fig 2 the strain gauge is mounted on a platform and connected to the support shaft using an adjustable nut and the loading location is 0 87 m above the disc centre the disc support system rotates around a horizontal shaft freely when the flow load is applied to the system a spirit level maintains the support system vertical and ensures that the disc swept area is orthogonal to the x direction the flow force on the support system is determined using the lever principle as the lower part of the support system is immersed in water the flow force measured by the strain gauge comprises both the flow thrust on the disc swept area and the drag on the support shaft furthermore the flow force is measured with and without the porous disc for 600 s at a frequency of 5 hz using a dynamic strain gauge we observed that the flow loads on the support system fluctuate with time fig 4 the averaged load values with and without the disc are 0 61 n and 0 10 n and the corresponding standard deviations are 0 04 n and 0 003 n respectively thus the average thrust coefficient c t of the disc is 0 99 with a standard deviation of 0 08 as mentioned in section 2 1 the blockage corrected thrust coefficient c t is 0 92 thus the axial flow induction factor is obtained as 0 36 based on the momentum theory burton et al 2011 the maximum value of the equivalent power coefficient for a turbine rotor is referred to as the lanchester betz limit which occurs when the axial flow induction factor is 1 3 and the corresponding thrust coefficient is 0 89 this implies that the disc porosity in this experiment is smaller than the optimal one generating an enlarged blockage effect for the flow passing through the disc 3 wake spatial evolution 3 1 wake velocity deficit fig 5 depicts the velocity recovery process behind the porous disc at 1d downstream the wake zone is approximately 1 5 times the disc swept area the flow velocity reduces abruptly as the flow passes through the disc generating a wake core of size similar to the disc swept area the maximum velocity deficit in the wake core is 87 6 at x 1d owing to the momentum loss the velocity deficit in the wake core is associated with the thrust coefficient which is primarily determined by the disc porosity however the velocity deficit behind the disc is not a function of disc porosity alone as the thrust coefficient is influenced by the size and number of disc holes as well myers and bahaj 2010 the small size of the pores in this study produces a high thrust coefficient and large velocity deficit downstream a shear layer occurs between the wake core and free flow at x 1d the thickness of the shear layer is approximately 0 25d and the radial distribution of the velocity deficit in the shear layer is approximately linear see fig 6 a at 2d downstream the shear layer spreads towards the wake core with limited outward expansion and the wake size is nearly identical to that of 1d downstream fig 5 however the maximum velocity deficit in the wake core increases to 91 0 at x 2d at this stage a further momentum loss occurs in the wake core owing to the pressure recovery caused by the significant decrease in water pressure as the flow passes through the disc a similar wake recovery pattern was observed in a model turbine experiment reported by mycek et al 2014 thus the velocity deficit gradient attenuates in the shear layer with the velocity deficit profiles turning less regular the flow bypassing the disc is accelerated and the velocity increments up to 28 4 at 1d downstream however it nearly recovers to the ambient flow at x 3d fig 6 at this stage a significant reduction in the velocity deficit in the wake core and limited wake expansion occur simultaneously the high momentum transported into the wake zone originates from the accelerated bypassing flow particularly below the disc centre fig 5 subsequently the wake zone expands in both vertical and transverse directions and the wake edge turns increasingly irregular however the vertical wake expansion is limited by both the water surface and flume bed thus the wake centre moves vertically upwards beyond 3d downstream and a faster wake recovery occurs in the downward direction owing to the greater inflow turbulence close to the flume bed fig 3b for a wide channel the wake lateral expansion is relatively free and the expansion rate relies on the turbulence intensity of the ambient flow at x 5 5d the width of the wake zone is approximately twice the disc diameter further downstream the wake centre continues to move upwards and the wake zone expands laterally as the velocity recovers further 3 2 shear induced turbulence diffusion and dissipation tidal energy extraction by tidal turbines decreases the wake velocity and increases the turbulence intensity the wake turbulence is induced by the shear around the wake edge and disturbance from the turbine blades nacelle and tower the turbulence generated by the turbine structure decays rapidly causing substantial heat dissipation within the near wake region stallard et al 2015 3 2 1 longitudinal turbulence the wake turbulence is primarily generated in the shear layer around the wake core fig 7 at 1d downstream high turbulence intensity is observed primarily in the wake boundary whereas it is equivalent to the low intensity of ambient flow in the wake core region this implies that the kinetic energy loss generates from other mechanical energy transformation rather than the wake turbulence generation although the velocity gradient is predominantly uniform the longitudinal turbulence intensity is non uniform in the shear layer therefore a higher turbulence intensity is observed in the upper half of the shear layer with a maximum intensity of 29 5 however the turbulence intensity gradient is high outside the shear layer and the gradient towards the ambient flow differs from that observed at the wake core initially the strong turbulence in the shear layer diffuses towards the wake core with limited outward diffusion in comparison with the velocity deficit distribution the shear induced turbulence spreads faster inwards at 3d downstream the high intensity turbulence envelops the entire wake region before spreading outwards the attenuation of wake turbulence primarily involves the diffusion and dissipation processes as indicated in fig 7 limited turbulent energy dissipation occurs before the diffusion of shear induced turbulence into the entire wake zone 1 3d at x 4d the turbulence diffuses outwards and the gradient of the turbulence intensity reduces in the entire wake region however the wake turbulence zone expansion is limited further downstream in the vertical direction owing to the shallow water depth the turbulence intensity distribution increases in irregularity as the wake turbulence dissipates further as depicted in fig 7 8 5 10d the dissipation process is faster near the flume bed owing to the large turbulence intensity of the downward inflow along the water depth moreover the wake turbulence area enlarges in the upward direction along the water depth and the turbulence zone separates into two parts from the bottom 3 2 2 transverse and vertical turbulence the shear induced turbulence is generated by the interaction between the slow moving wake flow and the fast moving bypass flow although this has been studied to a certain extent the existing literature on wake turbulence does not explore the transverse and vertical components of the turbulence in detail myers and bahaj 2010 vinod and banerjee 2019 ahmadi and yang 2020 in comparison with the intensity of the longitudinal turbulence that of the transverse turbulence is significantly lower in the wake region however the vertical intensity is significantly higher fig 8 at x 1d the distribution of vertical turbulence intensity in the shear layer is anisotropic with the peak value of 35 5 which is substantially higher than the transverse and longitudinal turbulence intensities this phenomenon can be attributed to the flow separation at the disc edge however further investigations on the variations in vertical velocity are needed at the initial stage of wake evolution the diffusion processes of the transverse and vertical turbulence are similar to that of the longitudinal turbulence in other words the shear induced turbulence flow spreads into the wake core with minimal outward diffusion as it envelops the entire wake zone with a predominantly uniform turbulence intensity at x 3d thereafter the dissipation processes differ the transverse turbulence dissipates below the wake centre rapidly and the region of high turbulence intensity moves in the upward direction as it spreads towards the two lateral sides conversely rapid dissipation of vertical turbulence is observed in the lower area with limited diffusion outwards the details of the transverse and vertical turbulence diffusion and dissipation are presented in appendices c and d respectively 4 reynolds shear stress and wake energy restoration 4 1 reynolds shear stress typically the reynolds shear stress r xy in the process of wake energy restoration transports the high momentum from the ambient flow to the wake zone tedds et al 2014 ahmadi and yang 2020 the reynolds shear stress in the x y plane r xy is generated from the shear layer at the wake edge however the wake core generates minimal shear stress fig 9 at 1d downstream significant r xy is observed at the two lateral sides of the wake core with the shear stress on the right hand side y 0 0 m greater than that of the left hand side y 0 0 m as the wake expands downstream the shear stress r xy spreads towards both the wake core and the ambient flow with a lower outward spreading speed than that of the inward spreading in the range of 1 2d downstream the momentum is transported from the bypass flow into the wake zone and the velocity deficit is recovered from the wake edge and the centre consecutively fig 5 at x 3d the value of r xy increases higher than the peak value observed at x 1d this implies that the rapid wake energy restoration occurs as the shear stress envelops the wake region completely however the reynolds shear stress weakens around y 0 moreover the r xy value attenuates beyond 3d downstream in the longitudinal direction at this stage the high shear stress zone spreads moderately outwards and gradually separates towards the two lateral sides at x 8 5d the shear stress zone separates into two completely isolated zones with irregular distribution of r xy and exhibits a lateral expansion towards the water surface fig 10 depicts the distribution of reynolds shear stress in the y z plane r yz in comparison with r xy the value of r yz is small in the shear layer at 1d downstream the profile of r yz in the shear layer is inhomogeneous large r yz is observed primarily on the left hand side y 0 0 m of the wake core whereas it is less regular on the right hand side y 0 0 m the high shear stress zone spreads inwards with the longitudinal distance however it does not envelop the entire wake region the value of r yz decreases rapidly in the near wake region particularly at lower areas beyond 4d downstream the average value of r yz is negligible the shear stress r zx is significant in the upper half of the shear layer downstream as depicted in fig 11 r zx is approximately 0 2 at x 1d which is greater than the peak value of r xy in the wake zone this implies that the momentum transfer in the z x plane is more intense than that of the x y plane however the momentum transfer in the z x plane primarily occurs in the local region above the wake centre with increasing distance r zx attenuates rapidly and spreads primarily towards the wake centre the shear stress r zx reduces to 0 16 at 3d downstream as it envelops half of the wake region above the wake centre furthermore significant attenuation is observed in the shear stress at x 4d and it attains the level of the ambient flow further downstream 4 2 wake energy restoration the wake flow is characterised by decreased flow velocity and increased turbulence intensity in the wake spatial evolution process the wake zone expands towards the two lateral sides while the hydrodynamic properties remain almost uninfluenced by the wake beyond the region y 2d 2d therefore the kinetic energy transformation during wake evolution is investigated within the region y 2d 2d the total kinetic energy e k in the region y 2d 2d is calculated as 3 e k e k w e k a where e kw and e ka are defined as a w 1 2 ρ u w 2 e d a w and a a 1 2 ρ u a 2 e d a a respectively similarly the total turbulent energy e t in the region y 2d 2d is calculated as 4 e t e t w e t a where e tw and e ta are defined as a w 1 2 ρ t i w u 2 e d a w and a a 1 2 ρ t i a u 2 e d a a respectively in equations 3 and 4 the subscripts w and a represent the wake flow and ambient flow respectively ρ denotes the water density a and u represent the flow area and mean inflow velocity respectively e determines the inflow energy using a 1 2 ρ u 2 1 2 ρ ti u 2 d a and ti denotes the turbulence intensity the area where the velocity deficit occurs represents the wake area while the remaining area in the region y 2d 2d is considered as the ambient flow area the wake flow area increases owing to the wake expansion whereas the ambient flow area reduces with wake evolution the values calculated using equations 3 and 4 are nondimensionalised by dividing the inflow energy e over the region y 2d 2d to evaluate the variations in the kinetic and turbulent energies during the wake evolution process the kinetic and turbulent energies are calculated at each cross section in the range x 1d 10d fig 12 initially the values of e kw e ka e tw and e ta at each cross section are divided into 527 subdomains and initialised subsequently a program file reads the data of velocity u turbulence intensity ti flow area a and velocity deficit of each subdomain the velocity deficit estimates the value of the subdomain and the subdomain is a part of either the wake flow or the ambient flow region depending on whether the value is negative or positive respectively furthermore the kinetic and turbulent energies are calculated in the subdomain followed by the iterative summation to determine the energies in the wake flow or the ambient flow region the aforementioned steps are repeated to determine all the subdomains finally the results of e kw e ka e tw and e ta are added to obtain the values of e k and e t using equations 3 and 4 respectively fig 13 a illustrates the variations in the total kinetic energy wake kinetic energy and ambient flow kinetic energy in the range x 1d 10d similarly fig 13 b illustrates the variations in the total turbulent energy wake turbulent energy and ambient flow turbulent energy at x 1d the total kinetic energy is 86 9 and the kinetic energy loss is 13 1 in the very near wake region which is caused by the mechanical energy transformation and turbulence generation seo et al 2016 the turbulent energy in the wake zone is 3 0 and a significant energy loss that accounts to approximately 23 of the kinetic energy loss is observed owing to the wake turbulence the remaining kinetic energy losses are transformed into other types of energy as the flow passes through the disc at 2d downstream the kinetic energy in the wake zone is marginally greater than that of 1d consequently the amount of kinetic energy decreased in the ambient flow this decrement is marginally less than the increment of the wake kinetic energy furthermore the kinetic energy in the region x 2d 3d increases and decreases by 11 9 and 16 8 in the wake region and the ambient flow respectively the wake re energization and the remaining kinetic energy loss increase the low pressure in the wake moreover the shear layer in the range 1 3d downstream diffuses towards the wake centre significantly with limited turbulent energy dissipation the turbulent energy reduces in the wake zone from 3d to 4d downstream however the kinetic energy from both the ambient flow and wake zone increases slightly this increment could be attributed to the decrease in water level however further experiments are necessary to confirm the variations in energy additionally the kinetic energy in the wake region increases further whereas that of the ambient flow decreases owing to the wake expansion the red line in fig 13 a indicates the increase pattern of kinetic energy in the wake region which is non linear in the flow direction with a slow increase rate beyond 7d downstream the kinetic energy increment in the wake flow is equivalent to the decrement of ambient flow in the range 5 5 10d however the turbulent energy in the wake region dissipates continuously with a gradual decrease in the dissipation rate fig 13b 5 discussion in this study a porous disc is used to approximately represent the turbine rotor based on the force equivalence principle using the porous disc does have limitations for example the wake swirl and vortices induced by turbine rotor cannot be simulated by the static disc the differences mainly appear in the near wake within 4d downstream myers and bahaj 2010 nash and phoenix 2017 the flow structure of the near wake behind the turbine may be more complex than that behind porous disc the wake swirl and boundary layer could affect the momentum transfer in the process of near wake evolution zhang et al 2021b which should be further studied compared with the model turbine experiments morandi et al 2016 seo et al 2016 the amount of kinetic energy loss caused by wake turbulence is much larger just behind disc in the process of near wake evolution the high momentum initially comes from the accelerated flow caused by the blockage effect in the range 1 2d the kinetic energy increment in the wake zone is larger than the kinetic energy decrement in the ambient flow moreover the energy supply is attributed to the potential energy conversion owing to the decrease in water level fallon et al 2014 ramos et al 2013 however the experimental data on the free surface variations obtained from the existing studies are limited in our experiment the shallow water depth increases the blockage ratio in the vertical direction and enhances the vertical components of the reynolds shear stress and shear induced turbulence additionally the corresponding momentum transfer driven by the reynolds shear stress is highly intense in the x z plane before the shear layer reaches the wake centre the turbulent energy in the wake region increases continuously within the 3d region this implies that the kinetic energy of the ambient flow is utilised to enhance the wake turbulence however the energy loss from the ambient flow is not equivalent to the increment in the wake zone energy when only the kinetic and turbulent energies are considered this is because the local pressure in the wake zone reduces as the flow passes through the turbine burton et al 2011 zangiabadi et al 2017 and the pressure recovery can utilise the kinetic energy from the ambient flow as the measurement of wake pressure is challenging the process of wake pressure recovery cannot be understood completely with this limited data moreover the wake turbulence is enhanced owing to the tip vortex shedding and the disturbance from the turbine nacelle tower and support system zhang et al 2020b however the turbulence may affect the wake energy restoration in the near wake region limitedly as it dissipates almost completely within 1d downstream stallard et al 2015 according to bahaj et al 2007b the properties of the far wake region behind the porous disc can be associated with that of a scaled turbine rotor in this scenario the momentum transfer primarily occurs in the x y plane and the high momentum transported into the wake zone primarily generates from the ambient flow around the lateral sides the kinetic energy from the ambient flow is not utilised entirely to recover the wake flow which results in an energy loss in addition the turbulent energy dissipates as the turbulence zone diffuses outwards thus the wake kinetic energy cannot recover completely to the inflow condition the experimental data obtained from this study can be used to design turbine arrays in an aligned layout the downstream turbines must not be located within the 3d region as their stability can be affected by the shear induced turbulence with limited dissipation we demonstrated that the turbulent energy attenuates while the kinetic energy increases further in the range of 4 7d within the wake region therefore the turbine performance can be improved by placing the turbines in an aligned array beyond 7d downstream moreover the wake zone expands laterally attaining a width of up to 2d at 5 5d downstream therefore to obtain a staggered layout the turbines can be located within 5 5d downstream or further upstream to capture the accelerated bypass flow and avoid the negative effects of the merging of individual wakes however the wake hydrodynamics in a staggered array is complex owing to the wake interaction if the spacing between turbines is small the wake evolution process may be affected therefore further investigations are needed to determine the wake interactions and optimise the turbine array layout 6 conclusions we performed laboratory experiments to study the hydrodynamic mechanism of the wake spatial evolution and kinetic energy restoration the following conclusions can be drawn from the experimental results 1 the wake velocity decreases rapidly owing to the momentum loss the turbulence level is elevated significantly in the shear layer around the wake core and the energy utilised by the turbulence accounts for a large percentage of the kinetic energy loss 2 at the initial stage of wake evolution the boundary shear layer spreads into the wake core with limited wake expansion and turbulence dissipation however the flow velocity recovers significantly as the shear induced turbulence reaches the wake centre followed by significant wake expansion and turbulence dissipation 3 the momentum transfer in the z x plane is substantially stronger than that in the x y plane in the near wake region conversely it is primarily in the x y plane further downstream owing to the attenuation of the reynolds shear stress r zx close to the ambient flow level beyond 4d downstream moreover the mechanical energy loss occurs primarily in the region 2 3d during the wake energy restoration process credit author statement none declaration of

20834,frequent water level fluctuation such as wave is one of the significant differences that distinguish subsea tunnels from land tunnels for a better understanding of the influence of the dynamic wave loading this study develops a new set of analytical solutions for the wave induced hydraulic response on the subsea shield tunnels the proposed analytical solutions are verified with numerical simulation and a good agreement is observed between the hydraulic regimes obtained from both methods a detailed parametric analysis is presented about the effect of wave characteristics seabed properties and tunnel parameters on the hydraulic response including the water pressure distribution around the tunnel water inflow seabed liquefaction and the hydrodynamic forces acting on the tunnel it reveals that soil permeability is the most significant factor in affecting the wave induced hydraulic response besides the embedded shield tunnel acts as an obstruction to the water pressure propagation and a drain in the seabed at the same time the former effect leads to the asymmetric distribution of the maximum water pressure around the tunnel and the latter one dissipates the pore

seems acceptable for land tunnels but oversimplified to take into account the wave impact for subsea tunnels located in the coastal areas which are usually prone to frequent raids of typhoons and swell waves subsea tunnels face challenges subject to the water pressures generated by the natural dynamic loading including instability problems seabed liquefaction etc kasper et al 2008 chen et al 2018 han et al 2019 the earliest research into wave induced seabed response can date back to the 1940s putnam 1949 from then on various models have been proposed based on the different assumptions of stiffness relation between the soil skeleton and the water sleath 1970 moshagen and torum 1975 yamamoto et al 1978 among them yamamoto et al 1978 as the first scholar considered the compressibilities of both solid and fluid phases using biot s consolidation theory ever since this theoretical framework employed in this paper has given rise to a wide application in geotechnical and coastal engineering hsu et al 1993 hsu and jeng 1994 jeng 1996 1997a chen et al 2019 to date although the academic community has shown great interest in the effect of wave action on marine structures such as breakwaters and subsea pipelines jeng 1997b sumer et al 1999 miyamoto et al 2020 the research related to the wave induced response around the subsea tunnel is quite limited subsea pipelines and tunnels may appear similar at first glance but the former is usually treated as waterproof on the soil structure interface zhou et al 2013 lin et al 2016 while the latter is permeable as mentioned above furthermore these two kinds of marine structures vary in the cross section magnitude in addition to the burial depth the main objective of this paper is to investigate the wave induced hydraulic response around the subsea tunnels the mathematical description of such a boundary value problem is given first followed by the derivation of the analytical solution based on biot s consolidation theory then a numerical simulation is conducted to verify the proposed analytical solution by comparing the hydraulic regimes obtained from both methods finally a parametric study is examined about the influence of various wave characteristics seabed properties and tunnel parameters on the hydraulic response including the water pressure distribution around the tunnel water inflow seabed liquefaction and the hydrodynamic forces acting on the tunnel 2 mathematical statement 2 1 basic assumptions as shown in fig 1 a circular tunnel is embedded in a semi infinite aquifer covered by a water layer whose static water level is h the tunnel has the internal radius r and an external radius r with a burial depth of d the coordinate system is established in such a way that y axis goes through the tunnel center and x axis chosen as the elevation reference datum lies on the seabed surface termed as the mud line in some literature a progressive wave travels towards the right hand side over the tunnel this is a simplified scenario but reasonable as a first attempt though the wave obliquity is also an important factor to influence the hydraulic response this paper employs the following assumptions to derive the analytical solutions on the wave induced hydraulic response included in which are 1 the aquifer and lining layer are isotropic porous media 2 the water flow follows darcy s law 3 the water pressure on the internal surface of the tunnels is 0 pa 4 airy wave acts on the seabed surface assumption 1 may seem inconsistent with the reality but such simplification still can provide us some valuable insight into the problem as a preliminary study and similar treatment is widely applied throughout the literature park et al 2008 ying et al 2019 2 2 governing equation this article assumes that both the porous media and the pore fluid are compressible so the governing equation employed herein is the biot s consolidation theory biot 1941 which includes the conservation of momentum 1 g 2 u j g 1 2 ν ε v x j p x j 0 j 1 2 3 where g ν ε v u j are interpreted as respectively the shear modulus poisson s ratio the volumetric strain and the displacement for the porous media p represents the pore water pressure x j is the cartesian coordinate and the conservation of mass reading 2 k s γ f 2 p n β f p t ε v t in which k s n denote the coefficient of permeability and the porosity for the porous media accordingly γ f is the unit weight of pore water and β f refers to the compressibility of pore fluid related to the degree of saturation s r such that 3 β f β f 0 1 s r p 0 where β f 0 is the compressibility of pure water which is roughly 4 5 10 10 pa 1 at 20 c kell 1975 and p 0 is the absolute pore water pressure 2 3 boundary conditions under the assumptions listed in section 2 1 the hydraulic boundary conditions on the tunnel s inner circumference and the seabed surface are given by 4 bc 1 p x 2 y d 2 r 0 and 5 bc 2 p y 0 p 0 exp i κ x ω t in the equation above κ 2 π l is the wavenumber where l is the wavelength ω 2 π t is the wave frequency in which t is the period and p 0 denotes the amplitude factor with the following expression according to the linear wave theory 6 p 0 γ f h 2 cosh k h in which h is the wave height besides for the circumstance of porous soil of infinite thickness discussed in this study the wave induced pore pressure is assumed to vanish with depth which provides the third boundary condition i e 7 bc 3 p y 0 3 analytical solution in this section the principle of superposition is applied to transfer the wave induced hydraulic response surrounding the subsea tunnel as the combination of the water pressure response of the pure seabed subjected to the wave action and the pore pressure propagation reflected by the tunnel the former has the following expression from hsu et al s work hsu et al 1993 i e 8 p i 1 p 0 1 2 ν 1 2 ν λ c 1 e κ y δ 2 κ 2 κ 1 ν c 2 e δ y exp i κ x ω t herein the coefficient λ captures the relative compressibility between the pore fluid and soil skeleton expressed as 9 λ 1 2 ν n β f g n β f g 1 2 ν the δ parameter is coupled with soil properties and wave conditions given by 10 δ 2 κ 2 i ω γ f k s n β f 1 2 ν 2 g 1 ν and the c coefficients are related to δ and λ whose values can be determined from 11 c 1 δ δ ν κ ν δ δ ν κ ν κ λ 12 c 2 κ λ δ δ ν κ ν κ λ δ κ since eq 8 satisfies bc2 the water pressure caused by the tunnel should be zero on the seabed surface in such a case the decoupled governing equation for the seepage contributed from the tunnel could be deduced from biot s equation provided that the total stress variation is ignored ying et al 2018a rendering 13 2 p ρ 2 1 ρ p ρ 1 ρ 2 2 p θ 2 c cs p t herein the origin of the polar

tunnel should be used and d n e n f n and g n are unknowns inter related with a n and b n upon satisfying the boundary conditions at the soil tunnel interface and the inner surface of the tunnel in domain ii p ii has the following two boundary conditions at ρ r and ρ r in the form of fourier series 22 p ii r θ e i ω t n 0 s n sin n θ w n cos n θ 23 p ii r θ e i ω t n 0 u n sin n θ v n cos n θ here s n w n 0 u n 0 2 π p i sin n θ π d θ v 0 0 5 0 2 π p i π d θ and v n 0 2 π p i cos n θ π d θ by comparing the coefficients before even and odd terms cos n θ and sin n θ the unknowns in eq 21 can

interface between the seabed and the tunnel i e 28 p i ρ k l k s p ii ρ where k s k l denote the permeability for the seabed and the lining respectively expanding both sides of eq 28 in the form of fourier series gives the following expression for the coefficient before each term of the left side 29 k l i 1 2 π 0 2 π p i ρ ρ r e i l θ d θ l 0 1 2 and that of the right side 30 k l ii 1 2 π 0 2 π k l k s p ii ρ ρ r e i l θ d θ l 0 1 2 setting eq 29 equal to eq 30 yields an equation set of 2n 1 order consistent with the number of unknowns which is a solvable problem thus once a n and b n are evaluated the wave induced water pressure response surrounding a subsea tunnel could be calculated from eq 20 the number of terms in the azimuthal sums n is truncated at some value and the trial test shows that n max 10 is sufficient to achieve satisfactory converged results once the hydraulic regime is determined many other physical quantities are obtainable from eqs 20 and 21 for instance the horizontal and vertical hydraulic gradients defined as the spatial derivative of the hydraulic head can be expressed as 31 i j 1 γ f p i x j j 1 2 multiplying the hydraulic gradients with the unit weight of pore water gives rise to the seepage forces 32 f j p i x j j 1 2 besides by integrating the seepage velocities around the seabed tunnel interface the transient water inflow into the tunnel can be written as follows 33 q t π k l c l r d 0 h 1 1 c l r h 1 1 c l r e 0 h 1 2 c l r h 1 2 c l r e i ω t the uplift vertical and horizontal forces acting on the subsea tunnel caused by the unevenly distributed pore pressure outside the tunnel circumference can be determined with the following expressions 34 f v r 0 2 π p i cos θ d θ 35 f h r 0 2 π p i sin θ d θ 4 verification in this section the proposed analytical solutions are first verified against the experimental result on the wave sediment pipeline interaction from turcotte 1984 then a second verification is given by comparing the results between the analytical solution and numerical simulation for subsea tunnels 4 1 verification with experimental study note that the analytical solutions presented in this study can be reduced to the case of the submarine pipeline when the lining permeability is taken as 0 in eq 28 therefore we first corroborate this work via the experimental study conducted in the wave tank at cornell university turcotte 1984 these empirical results are widely applied to verify newly developed theories by the community of ocean engineering such as cheng and liu 1986 who studied the wave induced seepage force on a pipeline using the boundary integral equation method biem fig 2 illustrates the input data for the test and the pore pressure amplitude around the pipeline from this study square symbol line biem circle symbol line and the experimental study denoted by rhombus by comparison we can find that both this study and biem can make close predictions to the experimental results specifically better accordance is observed between this study and the experiment at the bottom and the right half circumference of the pipeline but less consistency at the left semi circle nevertheless this study still seems promising to probe into the wave induced hydraulic response 4 2 verification with numerical simulation herein a numerical simulation using software comsol is conducted to certify the correctness of the novel analytical solutions note that eqs 31 35 are all derivations of eq 20 or eq 21 so the verification of the hydraulic regime is the fundamental issue table 1 lists all indispensable parameters for the verification wang et al 2019 wu et al 2020 fig 3 plots the wave induced water pressure responses on the seabed tunnel interface in case of the tunnel embedded seabed and pure seabed at four typical moments i e t 1 4 t t 1 2 t t 3 4 t and t t in fig 3 the vertical axis means the normalized water pressure with respect to p 0 and the horizontal axis denotes the inclined angle from the tunnel apex in addition the solid lines and hollow dots represent the analytical and numerical results of the pore water pressure distribution around the tunnel respectively and the dotted line is the pure seabed response as demonstrated in the figure the existence of the subsea tunnel compared with the pure seabed accounts for an increment of pore pressure above the tunnel and a decline around the invert when a wave crest t 1 4 t or wave trough t 3 4 t travels over the tunnel this phenomenon is named the block effect in this study which mainly originates from the obstruction of the subsea tunnel to the pore pressure propagation meanwhile the hydraulic response at the tunnel circumference is stronger than that of the pure seabed at almost any corresponding position when the water level above the tunnel resumes equilibrium state i e t 1 2 t or t t furthermore the minimum pore pressure appears at different locations for seabeds with or without a tunnel for instance when t 1 4 t or t 3 4 t the weakest water pressure response occurs at θ π for pure seabed whilst it is at θ 3 63 that the tunnel undergoes the minimum water pressure besides as expected a good agreement is observed between the results from numerical simulation and the method proposed in this paper 5 discussion detailed parametric analysis on the wave induced response of the subsea tunnel is presented in this section including the parameters of wave seabed and tunnel such as the wave period seabed s permeability and the thickness of lining this study is based on the imaginary part of eq 20 indicating that the progressive wave travels towards the right hand side in fig 1 thus the left semicircle is the front side facing the wave propagation while the opposite half is the backside note that all parameters unless specified otherwise are identical with those listed in table 1 in the following discussion 5 1 wave induced water pressure response wave induced water pressure response for various soil permeability k s is illustrated in fig 4 which depicts the circumferential distribution of the maximum non dimensional water pressure with respect to the amplitude factor p max p 0 marginal deviation of p max p 0 is observed as k s changes from 1 0 10 3 m s to 1 0 10 5 m s in contrast the curve for k s 1 0 10 2 m s compared with the other profiles presents distinct variation i e the tunnel apex suffers much greater water pressure while p max p 0 is apparently smaller at the tunnel invert moreover it is worth noting that p max p 0 on the front side is larger than that at the same horizontal level of the backside leading to the asymmetry of these curves this phenomenon is due to the block effect of the tunnel and is more obvious when the seabed has stronger permeability fig 5 demonstrates the effect of the degree of saturation s r on the wave induced water pressure response outside the tunnel s r exerts its influence on the seepage field via altering the compressibility of pore water calculated from eq 3 it is found that the maximum water pressure in the dimensionless form increases with s r for the whole tunnel circumference but the increment varies from one spot to another in general the front side sees a larger ascent than the backside and p max p 0 at the nether semi circle rises more than that at the upper half does for instance with s r rising from 0 98 to 1 0 the increments of p max p 0 are 0 18 and 0 15 at θ π 2 and θ 3 π 2 accordingly meanwhile δ p max p 0 at the tunnel invert is 0 12 while that at the tunnel apex is only 0 07 the proposed analytical solutions are further extended to the effect of the wavelength l on the wave induced water pressure response outside the subsea tunnel note that according to the linear wave theory wavelength period and water depth are restricted by each other through the so called dispersion relation expressed as follows 36 ω 2 k g tanh k h in which g is the gravity acceleration herein we focus on the effect of the wavelength with the period fixed so the water depth will change correspondingly according to eq 36 which can influence the value of absolute water pressure p 0 in eq 3 thus the saturation degree is tuned to maintain the compressibility of pore water constant as 1 0 10 7 pa 1 the profiles of p max p 0 portrayed in fig 6 show the declining trend with decreasing wavelength in other words the large wavelength can promote the propagation of water pressure from the progressive wave into the seabed additionally these curves tend to be symmetric as the wavelength increases which implies a smaller difference of p max p 0 between the front and back sides of the tunnel with the same depth for the curve l 100 m the difference of p max p 0 between θ 0 9 π and θ 1 1 π is 0 027 while the value drops to 0 021 for l 150 m 0 017 for l 200 m and 0 012 for l 300 m hence it is reasonable to deduce that the distribution profile of water pressure should be completely symmetric when the wavelength is infinite this inference is in accordance with common sense as the progressive wave with l reduces to the tide load which is a symmetric boundary fig 7 illustrates the effect of the lining thickness on the wave induced water pressure response for the subsea tunnel embedded in a highly permeable seabed k s 1 0 10 2 m s and the one with low permeability k s 1 0 10 5 m s herein the lining thickness varies from 0 1 m to 0 9 m which is achieved by maintaining the external tunnel radius constant while changing the internal tunnel radius fig 7a and b compares the depth variation of the maximum water pressure along y axis for the two kinds of seabeds which demonstrates totally different distribution patterns when the seabed is strongly permeable fig 7a p max p 0 increases above the tunnel and drops below compared with the case of the pure seabed for the seabed with relatively low permeability fig 7b the existence of the tunnel leads to the pore pressure dissipation at both the top and bottom of the tunnel this disparity comes from the fact that the subsea tunnel acts as an obstruction and a drain simultaneously for a permeable seabed the block effect is stronger than the dissipation effect and a reversal of the situation emerges with a lowly permeable seabed another difference between these two patterns is that the block effect can reach where it is approximately 1 0r away from the tunnel circumference while the influential range is very limited for the pore pressure dissipation the circumferential distribution of the maximum water pressure is plotted in fig 7c and d from which we can find that p max p 0 is insensitive to the lining thickness in both cases wave induced water pressure response for the subsea tunnel with various burial depths is plotted in fig 8 from fig 8a where the seabed is highly permeable we can find that the block effect is obvious and the influential range is around 1 0r from the soil tunnel interface wherever the subsea tunnel is located however the curves for varied burial depths in fig 8b are in close proximity to the depth variation of p max p 0 for the pure seabed which implies that both the block and drain effects from the tunnel are weak when the seabed is weakly permeable fig 8c and d depicts the descending tendency of p max p 0 as the tunnel is buried more deeply for both seabeds this conforms to common sense that the water pressure attenuates along the direction of propagation 5 2 water inflow fig 9 illustrates the time variation of the leakage induced transient water inflow q within two periods starting from t 100 s the temporal curve in fig 9 exhibits a harmonic pattern with the period averaged value equal to 0 indicating that the periodic wave actions make no contribution to the water leakage in the long run this is because the water inflow expression i e eq 33 is a harmonic function in the time domain so the integration within the time interval equal to t is null therefore we can simplify the wave condition as the case with a static water level and utilize the approximation expressions for steady state seepage to calculate the water inflow 5 3 wave induced liquefaction there exist two kinds of mechanisms for wave induced liquefaction i e the residual liquefaction and oscillatory liquefaction depending on how the excess pore pressure is generated this paper focuses on the second mechanism and the criterion proposed by zen and yamazaki 1990 is applied herein which can be expressed as 37 σ 0 x y 0 u e x y t p x 0 t p x y t where σ 0 x y 0 is the initial effective vertical stress u e x y t refers to the excess pore pressure p x 0 t means the wave pressure acting on the seabed surface and p x y t denotes the wave induced water pressure fig 10 demonstrates the depth variation of the excess pore pressure along y axis with various saturation degrees and soil permeability from the figure we can find that the liquefaction zone extends as the soil gets less saturated or less permeable this is due to the fact mentioned in section 5 1 that decreasing s r or k s can weaken the wave induced water pressure response p x y t which leads to the rise of excess pore pressure calculated from eq 37 besides all liquefaction depths are within 1 m implying that the seabed liquefaction has a very limited impact on the subsea tunnel as the majority of shield tunnels in practical applications are buried much more deeply than 1 m the lining thickness has a marginal influence on the wave induced water pressure response as seen in fig 7 so it can be inferred that the effect of lining thickness on seabed liquefaction is negligible the burial depth takes effect on the wave induced water pressure only when the seabed is permeable but in such a case the liquefaction phenomenon is not evident as shown in fig 10b thus it can be concluded that the burial depth of the subsea tunnel is another weak factor to influence the seabed liquefaction the effects of the wave characteristics on the sediment liquefaction are similar to the investigation by han et al 2019 so it is not given herein to avoid redundancy 5 4 wave induced forces on the tunnel subsea tunnels embedded in the seabed confront the uplift and horizontal forces due to the water pressure discrepancy around the tunnel circumference fig 11 presents the time variation of hydrodynamic forces in one complete period as illustrated in the figure η represents the elevation of the water surface and both curves of the hydrodynamic forces are trigonometric with the frequency equal to that of the exciting wave when the wave trough travels above the tunnel the uplift force is greatest in which case the corresponding horizontal force is relatively small on the contrary the maximum horizontal force occurs together with marginal uplift force when the water level over the tunnel restores to the equilibrium state thus there exists a phase difference which is around π 2 between the wave induced vertical and horizontal forces a lagged phase of 0 086 π is observed between the hydrodynamic forces and the progressive wave this is because it takes a certain time for the wave induced water pressure to propagate into an unsaturated seabed in this case the maxima of vertical and horizontal forces are 91 88 kn and 59 12 kn respectively which are non negligible loads when it comes to the structure and stability analysis fig 12 presents the maximum wave induced hydrodynamic forces acting on the subsea tunnel with respect to various wave and soil parameters including the soil permeability k s saturation degree s r wavelength l and burial depth d from the figure we can find that k s is the critical factor to determine the relative magnitudes between the wave induced maximum uplift and horizontal forces i e f v max and f h max when the seabed is weakly permeable 10 5 k s 10 4 m s f v max is exactly identical with f h max despite other parameters which could be verified through the solid dot curves in fig 12a and the other four in fig 12b with the increasing soil permeability from k s 10 4 m s to k s 10 3 m s a slight increment of f h max is observed while f v max is nearly unchanged indicating that the horizontal force acting on the subsea tunnel is higher than the uplift force in such seabeds as the seabed keeps becoming permeable f v max almost triples from 36 3 kn to 91 6 kn and f h max only increase by half as for the other three parameters it is found that more intensive wave induced hydrodynamic forces will be generated by a larger saturation degree smaller wavelength or shallower burial depth 6 concluding remarks this study develops a new set of analytical solutions for the hydraulic response of the subsea shield tunnel subjected to wave actions the water pressure and seepage continuity conditions on the soil tunnel interface are strictly satisfied which makes these solutions of high accuracy the proposed method is validated through the comparison with numerical simulation subsequently a detailed parametric analysis is given and the main conclusions are summarized in the following 1 the subsea shield tunnel acts as both an obstruction to block the pore water penetration in the seabed and a drain to dissipate the water pressure simultaneously besides the more permeable the seabed is the more significant the block effect appears while the weaker the dissipation effect as the tunnel blocks the pore water penetration p max is larger at the front side than the backside of the tunnel moreover the block effect can reach where it is as far as 1 0r away from the tunnel circumference when the seabed has high permeability but the dissipation effect has a very limited influence range in all situations 2 linear wave does not contribute to the leakage induced water inflow in the long run thus the water inflow can be evaluated in the case of steady state seepage with static water level instead seabed liquefaction induced by a progressive wave has a weak influence on the subsea shield tunnel as the liquefaction depth is usually much more shallow than the tunnel s burial depth 3 the uplift and horizontal forces are critical loads in terms of tunnel s structure analysis and fluctuate periodically with a phase difference of around π 2 a lagged phase is observed between the hydrodynamic forces and the progressive wave acting on the seabed surface the soil permeability is the fundamental factor in determining the relative magnitude of the uplift and horizontal forces when the seabed is weakly permeable these two forces are always the same with each other credit authorship contribution statement chengwei zhu methodology software validation formal analysis data curation

20834,frequent water level fluctuation such as wave is one of the significant differences that distinguish subsea tunnels from land tunnels for a better understanding of the influence of the dynamic wave loading this study develops a new set of analytical solutions for the wave induced hydraulic response on the subsea shield tunnels the proposed analytical solutions are verified with numerical simulation and a good agreement is observed between the hydraulic regimes obtained from both methods a detailed parametric analysis is presented about the effect of wave characteristics seabed properties and tunnel parameters on the hydraulic response including the water pressure distribution around the tunnel water inflow seabed liquefaction and the hydrodynamic forces acting on the tunnel it reveals that soil permeability is the most significant factor in affecting the wave induced hydraulic response besides the embedded shield tunnel acts as an obstruction to the water pressure propagation and a drain in the seabed at the same time the former effect leads to the asymmetric distribution of the maximum water pressure around the tunnel and the latter one dissipates the pore water pressure but only in quite adjacent areas keywords analytical solution hydraulic response leakage subsea shield tunnel biot s consolidation theory 1 introduction subsea tunnels are competitive options when it comes to coastal transportation with advantages specified as environment friendliness to the ocean ecosystem no obstruction of navigation channels and insensitivity to weather conditions common constructing methods include the immersion drilling and blasting and shield tunneling li et al 2016 chen et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 this study focuses on the last form whose cross section of the tunnel is usually treated as a circular cavity with a lining layer in mechanic and hydraulic analysis it is reported that there are at least 18 metro lines involving undersea tunneling in the most recent ten years in china zhou et al 2020 thus it has become a national priority to enhance the understanding of tunnel behavior in the offshore environment during the long term service period the majority of tunnels act as drains in the end due to the deformation cracks grouting holes assembling gaps etc palmer and belshaw 1980 cao et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 as a result the existence of these seepage paths can alter the hydraulic regime and account for a series of problems such as water leakage addenbrooke and potts 2001 ying et al 2018b many researchers have noticed this and conducted a mass of investigation into the leakage induced influences on ground and tunnel analytically el tani 2003 kolymbas and wagner 2007 park et al 2008 ying et al 2019 numerically lee and nam 2001 wongsaroj et al 2007 zhang et al 2015 and experimentally wang et al 2008 qin et al 2020 however almost all of these researches focus on the circumstance with a static water level which seems acceptable for land tunnels but oversimplified to take into account the wave impact for subsea tunnels located in the coastal areas which are usually prone to frequent raids of typhoons and swell waves subsea tunnels face challenges subject to the water pressures generated by the natural dynamic loading including instability problems seabed liquefaction etc kasper et al 2008 chen et al 2018 han et al 2019 the earliest research into wave induced seabed response can date back to the 1940s putnam 1949 from then on various models have been proposed based on the different assumptions of stiffness relation between the soil skeleton and the water sleath 1970 moshagen and torum 1975 yamamoto et al 1978 among them yamamoto et al 1978 as the first scholar considered the compressibilities of both solid and fluid phases using biot s consolidation theory ever since this theoretical framework employed in this paper has given rise to a wide application in geotechnical and coastal engineering hsu et al 1993 hsu and jeng 1994 jeng 1996 1997a chen et al 2019 to date although the academic community has shown great interest in the effect of wave action on marine structures such as breakwaters and subsea pipelines jeng 1997b sumer et al 1999 miyamoto et al 2020 the research related to the wave induced response around the subsea tunnel is quite limited subsea pipelines and tunnels may appear similar at first glance but the former is usually treated as waterproof on the soil structure interface zhou et al 2013 lin et al 2016 while the latter is permeable as mentioned above furthermore these two kinds of marine structures vary in the cross section magnitude in addition to the burial depth the main objective of this paper is to investigate the wave induced hydraulic response around the subsea tunnels the mathematical description of such a boundary value problem is given first followed by the derivation of the analytical solution based on biot s consolidation theory then a numerical simulation is conducted to verify the proposed analytical solution by comparing the hydraulic regimes obtained from both methods finally a parametric study is examined about the influence of various wave characteristics seabed properties and tunnel parameters on the hydraulic response including the water pressure distribution around the tunnel water inflow seabed liquefaction and the hydrodynamic forces acting on the tunnel 2 mathematical statement 2 1 basic assumptions as shown in fig 1 a circular tunnel is embedded in a semi infinite aquifer covered by a water layer whose static water level is h the tunnel has the internal radius r and an external radius r with a burial depth of d the coordinate system is established in such a way that y axis goes through the tunnel center and x axis chosen as the elevation reference datum lies on the seabed surface termed as the mud line in some literature a progressive wave travels towards the right hand side over the tunnel this is a simplified scenario but reasonable as a first attempt though the wave obliquity is also an important factor to influence the hydraulic response this paper employs the following assumptions to derive the analytical solutions on the wave induced hydraulic response included in which are 1 the aquifer and lining layer are isotropic porous media 2 the water flow follows darcy s law 3 the water pressure on the internal surface of the tunnels is 0 pa 4 airy wave acts on the seabed surface assumption 1 may seem inconsistent with the reality but such simplification still can provide us some valuable insight into the problem as a preliminary study and similar treatment is widely applied throughout the literature park et al 2008 ying et al 2019 2 2 governing equation this article assumes that both the porous media and the pore fluid are compressible so the governing equation employed herein is the biot s consolidation theory biot 1941 which includes the conservation of momentum 1 g 2 u j g 1 2 ν ε v x j p x j 0 j 1 2 3 where g ν ε v u j are interpreted as respectively the shear modulus poisson s ratio the volumetric strain and the displacement for the porous media p represents the pore water pressure x j is the cartesian coordinate and the conservation of mass reading 2 k s γ f 2 p n β f p t ε v t in which k s n denote the coefficient of permeability and the porosity for the porous media accordingly γ f is the unit weight of pore water and β f refers to the compressibility of pore fluid related to the degree of saturation s r such that 3 β f β f 0 1 s r p 0 where β f 0 is the compressibility of pure water which is roughly 4 5 10 10 pa 1 at 20 c kell 1975 and p 0 is the absolute pore water pressure 2 3 boundary conditions under the assumptions listed in section 2 1 the hydraulic boundary conditions on the tunnel s inner circumference and the seabed surface are given by 4 bc 1 p x 2 y d 2 r 0 and 5 bc 2 p y 0 p 0 exp i κ x ω

according to the linear wave theory 6 p 0 γ f h 2 cosh k h in which h is the wave height besides for the circumstance of porous soil of infinite thickness discussed in this study the wave induced pore pressure is assumed to vanish with depth which provides the third boundary condition i e 7 bc 3 p y 0 3 analytical solution in this section the principle of superposition is applied to transfer the wave induced hydraulic response surrounding the subsea tunnel as the combination of the water pressure response of the pure seabed subjected to the wave action and the pore pressure propagation reflected by the tunnel the former has the following expression from hsu et al s work hsu et al 1993 i e 8 p i 1 p 0 1 2 ν 1 2 ν λ c 1 e κ y δ 2 κ 2 κ 1 ν c 2 e δ y exp i κ x ω t herein the

δ κ since eq 8 satisfies bc2 the water pressure caused by the tunnel should be zero on the seabed surface in such a case the decoupled governing equation for the seepage contributed from the tunnel

interface between the seabed and the tunnel i e 28 p i ρ k l k s p ii ρ where k s k l denote the permeability for the seabed and the lining respectively expanding both sides of eq 28 in the form of fourier series gives the following expression for the coefficient before each term of the left side 29 k l i 1 2 π 0 2 π p i ρ ρ r e i l θ d θ l 0 1 2 and that of the right side 30 k l ii 1 2 π 0 2 π k l k s p ii ρ ρ r e i l θ d θ l 0 1 2 setting eq 29 equal to eq 30 yields an equation set of 2n 1 order consistent with the number of unknowns which is a solvable problem thus once a n and b n are evaluated the wave induced water pressure response surrounding a subsea tunnel could be calculated from eq 20 the number of terms in the azimuthal sums n is truncated at some value and the trial test shows that n max 10 is sufficient to achieve satisfactory converged results once the hydraulic regime is determined many other physical quantities are obtainable from eqs 20 and 21 for instance the horizontal and vertical hydraulic gradients defined as the spatial derivative of the hydraulic head can be expressed as 31 i j 1 γ f p i x j j 1 2 multiplying the hydraulic gradients with the unit weight of pore water gives rise to the seepage forces 32 f j p i x j j 1 2 besides by integrating the seepage velocities around the seabed tunnel interface the transient water inflow into the tunnel can be written as follows 33 q t π k l c l r d 0 h 1 1 c l r h 1 1 c l r e 0 h 1 2 c l r h 1 2 c l r e i ω t the uplift vertical and horizontal forces acting on the subsea tunnel caused by the unevenly distributed pore pressure outside the tunnel circumference can be determined with the following expressions 34 f v r 0 2 π p i cos θ d θ 35 f h r 0 2 π p i sin θ d θ 4 verification in this section the proposed analytical solutions are first verified against the experimental result on the wave sediment pipeline interaction from turcotte 1984 then a second verification is given by comparing the results between the analytical solution and numerical simulation for subsea tunnels 4 1 verification with experimental study note that the analytical solutions presented in this study can be reduced to the case of the submarine pipeline when the lining permeability is taken as 0 in eq 28 therefore we first corroborate this work via the experimental study conducted in the wave tank at cornell university turcotte 1984 these empirical results are widely applied to verify newly developed theories by the community of ocean engineering such as cheng and liu 1986 who studied the wave induced seepage force on a pipeline using the boundary integral equation method biem fig 2 illustrates the input data for the test and the pore pressure amplitude around the pipeline from this study square symbol line biem circle symbol line and the experimental study denoted by rhombus by comparison we can find that both this study and biem can make close predictions to the experimental results specifically better accordance is observed between this study and the experiment at the bottom and the right half circumference of the pipeline but less consistency at the left semi circle nevertheless this study still seems promising to probe into the wave induced hydraulic response 4 2 verification with numerical simulation herein a numerical simulation using software comsol is conducted to certify the correctness of the novel analytical solutions note that eqs 31 35 are all derivations of eq 20 or eq 21 so the verification of the hydraulic regime is the fundamental issue table 1 lists all indispensable parameters for the verification wang et al 2019 wu et al 2020 fig 3 plots the wave induced water pressure responses on the seabed tunnel interface in case of the tunnel embedded seabed and pure seabed at four typical moments i e t 1 4 t t 1 2 t t 3 4 t and t t in fig 3 the vertical axis means the normalized water pressure with respect to p 0 and the horizontal axis denotes the inclined angle from the tunnel apex in addition the solid lines and hollow dots represent the analytical and numerical results of the pore water pressure distribution around the tunnel respectively and the dotted line is the pure seabed response as demonstrated in the figure the existence of the subsea tunnel compared with the pure seabed accounts for an increment of pore pressure above the tunnel and a decline around the invert when a wave crest t 1 4 t or wave trough t 3 4 t travels over the tunnel this phenomenon is named the block effect in this study which mainly originates from the obstruction of the subsea tunnel to the pore pressure propagation meanwhile the hydraulic response at the tunnel circumference is stronger than that of the pure seabed at almost any corresponding position when the water level above the tunnel resumes equilibrium state i e t 1 2 t or t t furthermore the minimum pore pressure appears at different locations for seabeds with or without a tunnel for instance when t 1 4 t or t 3 4 t the weakest water pressure response occurs at θ π for pure seabed whilst it is at θ 3 63 that the tunnel undergoes the minimum water pressure besides as expected a good agreement is observed between the results from numerical simulation and the method proposed in this paper 5 discussion detailed parametric analysis on the wave induced response of the subsea tunnel is presented in this section including the parameters of wave seabed and tunnel such as the wave period seabed s permeability and the thickness of lining this study is based on the imaginary part of eq 20 indicating that the progressive wave travels towards the right hand side in fig 1 thus the left semicircle is the front side facing the wave propagation while the opposite half is the backside note that all parameters unless specified otherwise are identical with those listed in table 1 in the following discussion 5 1 wave induced water pressure response wave induced water pressure response for various soil permeability k s is illustrated in fig 4 which depicts the circumferential distribution of the maximum non dimensional water pressure with respect to the amplitude factor p max p 0 marginal deviation of p max p 0 is observed as k s changes from 1 0 10 3 m s to 1 0 10 5 m s in contrast the curve for k s 1 0 10 2 m s compared with the other profiles presents distinct variation i e the tunnel apex suffers much greater water pressure while p max p 0 is apparently smaller at the tunnel invert moreover it is worth noting that p max p 0 on the front side is larger than that at the same horizontal level of the backside leading to the asymmetry of these curves this phenomenon is due to the block effect of the tunnel and is more obvious when the seabed has stronger permeability fig 5 demonstrates the effect of the degree of saturation s r on the wave induced water pressure response outside the tunnel s r exerts its influence on the seepage field via altering the compressibility of pore water calculated from eq 3 it is found that the maximum water pressure in the dimensionless form increases with s r for the whole tunnel circumference but the increment varies from one spot to another in general the front side sees a larger ascent than the backside and p max p 0 at the nether semi circle rises more than that at the upper half does for instance with s r rising from 0 98 to 1 0 the increments of p max p 0 are 0 18 and 0 15 at θ π 2 and θ 3 π 2 accordingly meanwhile δ p max p 0 at the tunnel invert is 0 12 while that at the tunnel apex is only 0 07 the proposed analytical solutions are further extended to the effect of the wavelength l on the wave induced water pressure response outside the subsea tunnel note that according to the linear wave theory wavelength period and water depth are restricted by each other through the so called dispersion relation expressed as follows 36 ω 2 k g tanh k h in which g is the gravity acceleration herein we focus on the effect of the wavelength with the period fixed so the water depth will change correspondingly according to eq 36 which can influence the value of absolute water pressure p 0 in eq 3 thus the saturation degree is tuned to maintain the compressibility of pore water constant as 1 0 10 7 pa 1 the profiles of p max p 0 portrayed in fig 6 show the declining trend with decreasing wavelength in other words the large wavelength can promote the propagation of water pressure from the progressive wave into the seabed additionally these curves tend to be symmetric as the wavelength increases which implies a smaller difference of p max p 0 between the front and back sides of the tunnel with the same depth for the curve l 100 m the difference of p max p 0 between θ 0 9 π and θ 1 1 π is 0 027 while the value drops to 0 021 for l 150 m 0 017 for l 200 m and 0 012 for l 300 m hence it is reasonable to deduce that the distribution profile of water pressure should be completely symmetric when the wavelength is infinite this inference is in accordance with common sense as the progressive wave with l reduces to the tide load which is a symmetric boundary fig 7 illustrates the effect of the lining thickness on the wave induced water pressure response for the subsea tunnel embedded in a highly permeable seabed k s 1 0 10 2 m s and the one with low permeability k s 1 0 10 5 m s herein the lining thickness varies from 0 1 m to 0 9 m which is achieved by maintaining the external tunnel radius constant while changing the internal tunnel radius fig 7a and b compares the depth variation of the maximum water pressure along y axis for the two kinds of seabeds which demonstrates totally different distribution patterns when the seabed is strongly permeable fig 7a p max p 0 increases above the tunnel and drops below compared with the case of the pure seabed for the seabed with relatively low permeability fig 7b the existence of the tunnel leads to the pore pressure dissipation at both the top and bottom of the tunnel this disparity comes from the fact that the subsea tunnel acts as an obstruction and a drain simultaneously for a permeable seabed the block effect is stronger than the dissipation effect and a reversal of the situation emerges with a lowly permeable seabed another difference between these two patterns is that the block effect can reach where it is approximately 1 0r away from the tunnel circumference while the influential range is very limited for the pore pressure dissipation the circumferential distribution of the maximum water pressure is plotted in fig 7c and d from which we can find that p max p 0 is insensitive to the lining thickness in both cases wave induced water pressure response for the subsea tunnel with various burial depths is plotted in fig 8 from fig 8a where the seabed is highly permeable we can find that the block effect is obvious and the influential range is around 1 0r from the soil tunnel interface wherever the subsea tunnel is located however the curves for varied burial depths in fig 8b are in close proximity to the depth variation of p max p 0 for the pure seabed which implies that both the block and drain effects from the tunnel are weak when the seabed is weakly permeable fig 8c and d depicts the descending tendency of p max p 0 as the tunnel is buried more deeply for both seabeds this conforms to common sense that the water pressure attenuates along the direction of propagation 5 2 water inflow fig 9 illustrates the time variation of the leakage induced transient water inflow q within two periods starting from t 100 s the temporal curve in fig 9 exhibits a harmonic pattern with the period averaged value equal to 0 indicating that the periodic wave actions make no contribution to the water leakage in the long run this is because the water inflow expression i e eq 33 is a harmonic function in the time domain so the integration within the time interval equal to t is null therefore we can simplify the wave condition as the case with a static water level and utilize the approximation expressions for steady state seepage to calculate the water inflow 5 3 wave induced liquefaction there exist two kinds of mechanisms for wave induced liquefaction i e the residual liquefaction and oscillatory liquefaction depending on how the excess pore pressure is generated this paper focuses on the second mechanism and the criterion proposed by zen and yamazaki 1990 is applied herein which can be expressed as 37 σ 0 x y 0 u e x y t p x 0 t p x y t where σ 0 x y 0 is the initial effective vertical stress u e x y t refers to the excess pore pressure p x 0 t means the wave pressure acting on the seabed surface and p x y t denotes the wave induced water pressure fig 10 demonstrates the depth variation of the excess pore pressure along y axis with various saturation degrees and soil permeability from the figure we can find that the liquefaction zone extends as the soil gets less saturated or less permeable this is due to the fact mentioned in section 5 1 that decreasing s r or k s can weaken the wave induced water pressure response p x y t which leads to the rise of excess pore pressure calculated from eq 37 besides all liquefaction depths are within 1 m implying that the seabed liquefaction has a very limited impact on the subsea tunnel as the majority of shield tunnels in practical applications are buried much more deeply than 1 m the lining thickness has a marginal influence on the wave induced water pressure response as seen in fig 7 so it can be inferred that the effect of lining thickness on seabed liquefaction is negligible the burial depth takes effect on the wave induced water pressure only when the seabed is permeable but in such a case the liquefaction phenomenon is not evident as shown in fig 10b thus it can be concluded that the burial depth of the subsea tunnel is another weak factor to influence the seabed liquefaction the effects of the wave characteristics on the sediment liquefaction are similar to the investigation by han et al 2019 so it is not given herein to avoid redundancy 5 4 wave induced forces on the tunnel subsea tunnels embedded in the seabed confront the uplift and horizontal forces due to the water pressure discrepancy around the tunnel circumference fig 11 presents the time variation of hydrodynamic forces in one complete period as illustrated in the figure η represents the elevation of the water surface and both curves of the hydrodynamic forces are trigonometric with the frequency equal to that of the exciting wave when the wave trough travels above the tunnel the uplift force is greatest in which case the corresponding horizontal force is relatively small on the contrary the maximum horizontal force occurs together with marginal uplift force when the water level over the tunnel restores to the equilibrium state thus there exists a phase difference which is around π 2 between the wave induced vertical and horizontal forces a lagged phase of 0 086 π is observed between the hydrodynamic forces and the progressive wave this is because it takes a certain time for the wave induced water pressure to propagate into an unsaturated seabed in this case the maxima of vertical and horizontal forces are 91 88 kn and 59 12 kn respectively which are non negligible loads when it comes to the structure and stability analysis fig 12 presents the maximum wave induced hydrodynamic forces acting on the subsea tunnel with respect to various wave and soil parameters including the soil permeability k s saturation degree s r wavelength l and burial depth d from the figure we can find that k s is the critical factor to determine the relative magnitudes between the wave induced maximum uplift and horizontal forces i e f v max and f h max when the seabed is weakly permeable 10 5 k s 10 4 m s f v max is exactly identical with f h max despite other parameters which could be verified through the solid dot curves in fig 12a and the other four in fig 12b with the increasing soil permeability from k s 10 4 m s to k s 10 3 m s a slight increment of f h max is observed while f v max is nearly unchanged indicating that the horizontal force acting on the subsea tunnel is higher than the uplift force in such seabeds as the seabed keeps becoming permeable f v max almost triples from 36 3 kn to 91 6 kn and f h max only increase by half as for the other three parameters it is found that more intensive wave induced hydrodynamic forces will be generated by a larger saturation degree smaller wavelength or shallower burial depth 6 concluding remarks this study develops a new set of analytical solutions for the hydraulic response of the subsea shield tunnel subjected to wave actions the water pressure and seepage continuity conditions on the soil tunnel interface are strictly satisfied which makes these solutions of high accuracy the proposed method is validated through the comparison with numerical simulation subsequently a detailed parametric analysis is given and the main conclusions are summarized in the following 1 the subsea shield tunnel acts as both an obstruction to block the pore water penetration in the seabed and a drain to dissipate the water pressure simultaneously besides the more permeable the seabed is the more significant the block effect appears while the weaker the dissipation effect as the tunnel blocks the pore water penetration p max is larger at the front side than the backside of the tunnel moreover the block effect can reach where it is as far as 1 0r away from the tunnel circumference when the seabed has high permeability but the dissipation effect has a very limited influence range in all situations 2 linear wave does not contribute to the leakage induced water inflow in the long run thus the water inflow can be evaluated in the case of steady state seepage with static water level instead seabed liquefaction induced by a progressive wave has a weak influence on the subsea shield tunnel as the liquefaction depth is usually much more shallow than the tunnel s burial depth 3 the uplift and horizontal forces are critical loads in terms of tunnel s structure analysis and fluctuate periodically with a phase difference of around π 2 a lagged phase is observed between the hydrodynamic forces and the progressive wave acting on the seabed surface the soil permeability is the fundamental factor in determining the relative magnitude of the uplift and horizontal forces when the seabed is weakly permeable these two forces are always the same with each other credit authorship contribution statement chengwei zhu methodology software validation formal analysis data curation
