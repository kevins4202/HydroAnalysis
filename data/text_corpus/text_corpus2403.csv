12015,springs are the primary sources of drinking water for the people living in the mountainous region of nepal himalaya but emerging drought condition exacerbated by climate change has dried up springs thus sparking water crisis in the region the present study attempts to correlate the groundwater potential gwp zones and water poverty index wpi in the mid hill region of nepal himalaya the study was conducted in four drought prone village development committees vdcs namely bhatauli chisapani kathjor and manthali lying at the lower reaches of tamakoshi sub basin in ramechhap district of province number 3 nepal the in situ test of spring water revealed that ph ec tds and do values lie within the concentration limits of nepal drinking water quality standards and suitable for drinking or other uses groundwater potential zoning was carried out using the eight thematic layers namely elevation slope land use drainage density geomorphology lineament density rock and soil distribution and precipitation high groundwater potential has been delineated along the tamakoshi river while low potential areas lie in the western part of the study area the model is verified with the field observation as the most springs concentrated in the high and medium groundwater potential zones the study area has wpi values lower than the national wpi score suggesting the low availability of water in the area gwp correlates directly with wpi in the study area suggesting that gwp mapping alone can represent the water availability in the mid hill region of nepal himalaya graphical abstract image

food self sufficiency and sufficient domestic water supply and are a vital tool for policymakers feitelson and chenoweth 2002 molle and mollinga 2003 chenoweth 2008 however the water scarcity is expected to be of prime concern in the future with pronounced effect of climate change on hydrological cycle throughout the world vörösmarty et al 2000 khadka and pathak 2016 kandel et al 2017 bajracharya et al 2018 himalayan region is rich in water resources due to continuous replenishment of water in the region during winter snow fall and monsoon higher amount of precipitation is linked to the bigger runoff during the rainy season creating natural disasters like flood landslide and soil erosion however some regions experience water scarcity during the pre monsoon season constraining the water resources for irrigation and domestic usages sharma et al 2010 models predict precipitation is uncertain and varies over time while temperature constantly increases for the tamakoshi sub basin shrestha et al 2016 the storage of groundwater is manifested in the form of springs which are the major source of drinking water for people residing in these regions these sources are drying in the region at the faster rate in the recent times due to the consequences of climate change joshi and dongol 2018 the scarcity of water has bigger and negative impact on socioeconomic status of the people living in the region since the region frequently experiences water scarcity during pre monsoon season in the event of drought the assessment of water availability and delineation of groundwater potential zones are vital for socioeconomic growth of the people living in the region identification of groundwater potential gwp zones through remote sensing rs and geographic information system gis is an important step towards maximizing water availability in water shortage area delineating the ground water potential zones using rs and gis have been carried out by a number of researchers around the world chi and lee 1994 krishnamurthy et al 1996 das et al 1997 thomas et al 1999 sankar 2002 leblanc et al 2003 sener et al 2005 yeh et al 2009 magesh et al 2012 singh et al 2012 2013 2015 2018

2017 rajasekhar et al 2018 choudhari et al 2018 kumar et al 2018 nemcic jurec et al 2019 pande et al 2020 pathak and gautam 2019 pradhan et al 2020 the water poverty index wpi introduced by sullivan 2002 is a holistic tool for the conceptualization of water strategies many researchers have applied wpi concept in various form to compare water resources across countries and region lawrence et al 2002 sullivan et al 2003 2006 cullis and o regan 2004 manandhar et al 2012 hems 2016 thakur et al 2017 anju et al 2017 four village development committees vdcs in ramechhap district one of the drought prone districts of nepal joshi and dongol 2018 was chosen to study water availability and to assess the potential groundwater accumulation zones the average rainfall of manthali area in last 10 years found drastically lower which is less than 1000 mm that clearly indicates the area is being drought in compare to previous years this has resulted in drying of springs resulting water shortage in the study area the main objective of this study is to establish relationship between gwp and wpi the calculation of wpi is social science approach that demands many data that are difficult to assess for small administrative units hence requiring robust field data collection through consultation with the community and other stakeholder consumes more time and also requires significant data screening the quantitative data is helpful to quantify the water situation while qualitative data provides insights on adequacy of resources services or institutions thereby improving the understanding so as to prioritize the specific issues wilk and jonson 2013 on the other hand the groundwater potential mapping is physical science approach that can be conducted with rapid field data collection mainly spring inventory largely using the satellite imageries and aerial photographs to extract relevant data using available geological map and digital topographic data therefore once the groundwater potential map in the mountainous area could be used as an indicator for water poverty index it could greatly help in water resources management leading towards provisioning for water allocations at the areas of water deficiency because the low groundwater potential is an indication of limited occurrence of springs which is a major source of drinking water resulting in low water availability 1 1 study area the study area lies in ramechhap district mid hill region of nepal himalaya and incorporates four village development committees vdcs namely manthali bhatauli chisapani and kathjor in lower reaches of tamakoshi sub basin geographically the study area extends from 27 28 n to 27 50 n latitude and 85 50 e to 86 35 e longitude and covers an area of about 73 km2 fig 1 geologically the study area lies in the lesser himalaya and the study area entirely lies in kunchha formation that is predominantly consisting of phyllite with metasandstone and schist dhital 2015 there are mainly three types of aquifers in the area namely fractured aquifer on the bedrock unconfined aquifers in unconsolidated sediment mostly colluviums on the slope and both confined as well as unconfined aquifers at the fluvial sediments on the river valley the fracture springs are distributed in the central east part while the contact springs are confined to easternmost and westernmost part of the study area the depression springs are randomly distributed within the study area ramechhap is home to various different indigenous groups in nepal majority of people living in the study area are tamang sherpa gurung chhetri newar and majhi s the people living in this area are highly marginalized and economically vulnerable agriculture is the major source of income for the people living here however the productiveness of agriculture is seasonal and the majority of people is dependent on day to day labor for wages the land use of the study area is characterized by a mixture of forest cultivation bushes sandy area water body river stream barren land and settlement the district is the pocket area of sweet orange citrius sinencis locally known as junar major crops grown in the district are maize paddy millet wheat barley grain legumes oil seeds and potato the district is totally bounded by three main river systems of saptakoshi namely sunkoshi tamakoshi and likhu the major river that fall in the study area is tamakoshi river which flows from northeast to southwest and contain tributaries like ranjor khola sukhajor khola bhatauli khola thedi khola karkale khola kathjor khola lipe khola and mahadev khola the domestic water requirement is poorly met by the surface water as the settlements are situated at higher elevation and the river flows through the deeper valleys 2 materials and methods hydrogeological observations were carried out in the study area collecting lithological information updating landuse map preparing geomorphic map etc in addition in situ physico chemical measurement of spring water samples were carried out measuring hydrogen ion concentration ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds and dissolved oxygen do groundwater potential map was prepared in gis using effective controlling factors like slope elevation drainage density land use geomorphology lineament density rock and soil distribution and rainfall that influence the occurrence movement yield and quality of groundwater the geological map hasn t been used due to monotonous lithology within the study area slope elevation land use and drainage density maps were prepared from the digital topographic map of the department of survey while geomorphology and lineaments were extracted from satellite image the rainfall data in digital form was obtained from department of hydrology and meteorology government of nepal dhm 2017a ranks and weights were assigned to each thematic layer and its classes based on their significance for groundwater occurrence and field condition the output map obtained from overlay operation in gis was classified into three classes namely low moderate and high this study uses the wpi method to depict the water poverty situation in the studied area the wpi calculation is based on available secondary hydrological meteorological and socio demographic data and primary data were collected from community interviews during field investigations the five key components for the calculation of wpi are resource r access a capacity c use u and environment e which are the primary factors affecting water scarcity in a region the wpi is calculated for an area described by sullivan et al 2003 w p i w r r w a a w u u w c c w e e w a w r w u w c w e where wr wa wu wc and we are weights applied respectively to resource access use capacity and environment these weights are constrained to be non negative and sum to unity each of the components is standardized so that the value of wpi falls between 0 and 100 the highest value 100 is taken to describe the best situation whilst the worst is 0 sullivan et al 2003 anju et al 2017 each of the five components consists of a number of sub components and a weighting can be applied to each component to indicate the components importance sullivan et al 2002 compiled weighting groups as shown in table 1 to be added to wpi structure based on the local condition of the study area each five component is calculated by following methods in this study the minimum benchmark level for all components is 0 and the maximum benchmark level is 100 resource the resource component considers physical availability and variability of water resources availability r1 the r1 was measured by per capita annual water resource it was normalized using min max approach as shown below r 1 x i x m i n x m a x x m i n 100 where x i is per capita annual water resources m3 x m i n and x m a x are maximum and minimum values of that in the datasets considered for normalization variability r2 it measures variation of water resources over space and time and therefore is a measure of reliability of available water resources coefficient of variation cv of rainfall was calculated by following formula c v σ x 100 where σ standard deviation and x mean the variability in rainfall was calculated as the variation coefficient of the average annual rainfall between the period 1981 and 2016 as measured in the only one meteorological station in the study area at manthali therefore the spatial variation over the area couldn t be assessed and the value of coefficient of variation cv of rainfall is considered same constant for all vdc s the resource component value is therefore merely the average of the two subcomponents which is calculated as r r1 r2 2 use domestic and agricultural two major water uses were considered as indicators of use domestic water use u1 it was measured by water use per capita per day and normalized using min max approach where the min minimum water requirement for domestic hygiene was taken as 20 l per capita per day lpcd and max water ceiling that fulfills all water requirements was taken as 100 lpcd u 1 x i x m i n x m a x x m i n 100 where x i is domestic water use lpcd x m i n 20 lpcd and x m a x 100 lpcd u1 100 if x i 100 a n d u 1 0 i f x i 20 agricultural water use u2 the ratio of irrigated land to total cultivated land expressed in percentage is used as a proxy to assess the agricultural water use sullivan et al 2003 u 2 x i x 100 where x i and x are total irrigated and total cultivated areas respectively the use component value is therefore merely the average of the two subcomponents and is calculated as u u1 u2 2 access the access considers population with reasonable access to an adequate amount of safe drinking water and sanitation for better health and well being the two indicators access to water supply a1 and sanitation a2 are calculated a 1 x w x 100 a 2 x s x 100 where x w x s are population with water supply sanitation facility and x is the total population in the study area the access component is the average values of water supply and sanitation coverage which is calculated as a a1 a2 2 capacity the capacity is interpreted in terms of economic capacity and social capacity literacy rate c1i it is defined as the percentage of literate population aged 15 years and above that can read and write it is expressed as c 1 i x i x 100 where x i and x are the literate and total populations respectively economically active population c1ii it is defined as working age people lying between the ages of 10 60 years c 1 ii x i x 100 where x i and x denotes population under 10 60 years and total population respectively gdp index c2i it measures a decent standard of living in terms of gross domestic product gdp per capita income undp 2009 it was normalized to a comparable range of 0 100 as shown below gdp index c 2 i log per capita income log min log max log min 100 where the maximum max and minimum min values are set at 40 000 and 100 respectively as used by undp 2009 in calculating human development index nonagricultural employment c2ii it was calculated using following formula c 2 i i x i x 100 where x i and x are population involved in nonagricultural employment and total population respectively the capacity component value is therefore the average of four subcomponents and is calculated as c c1i c1ii c2i c2ii 4 environment this component is evaluated by two indicators environmental stress e1 and vegetation coverage e2 environmental stress e1 amount of chemical fertilizer use reflects environmental stress it was calculated as e 1 x max x i x m a x x m i n 100 where x i is the amount kg of chemical fertilizers used per hectare of land and x m a x and x m i n are the maximum and minimum values of the fertilizer used among all datasets considered for normalization vegetation coverage e2 the percentage of area covered by forest grass and wetlands is taken as vegetation coverage it is calculated as e 2 x i x 100 where x i and x represents vegetation coverage and total area including vegetation coverage and other land uses respectively the environment component value is therefore the average of two subcomponents and is calculated as e e1 e2 2 3 results and discussions 3 1 groundwater quality in situ chemical analysis of the 33 spring water samples revealed that the measured hydrogen ion concentration ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds and dissolved oxygen do of spring water is within the concentration limits of nepal drinking water quality standards ndqs 2005 and suitable for drinking or other beneficial uses the ph value ranges from 5 57 to 6 68 suggesting that the spring water is slightly acidic in nature likewise the ec value lies between 70 and 260 μs cm which indicates that the water are slightly to weakly mineralized detay 1997 the total dissolved solid tds values ranges from 68 to 260 mg l which shows that the water can be categorized as fresh water todd 2007 3 2 groundwater potential mapping various thematic layers that favor the groundwater occurrence have been integrated and a groundwater potential map has been prepared in gis the thematic maps factor maps used for the groundwater potential mapping in this study are briefly described below 3 2 1 elevation topography determines the direction of storm runoff over the ground surface gentle areas with lower elevation have a tendency to retain water longer inducing higher inﬁltration of recharge of water thapa et al 2017 higher elevation zones in the study area has few springs indicating that the recharge zone has low spring occurrence which is also evidenced in the other geographical regions e g sener et al 2005 the digital elevation model dem has been prepared from the contours available on the digital topographic data of the department of survey fig 2 a the central part of the study area is represented by low elevation while the eastern and western region have high elevations the ground surface elevation in the study area is classified into five different classes ranging from 465 m to 2000 m above mean sea level in terms of elevation the springs were located at the altitude ranging from 520 m to 1424 m 3 2 2 slope slope is one of the most important factors controlling the configuration of water table potentiometric surface and hence to the occurrence and movement of groundwater slope can be considered as an important factor in runoff and possible infiltration tiwari et al 2017 unconfined aquifer is more controlled by slope however for fractured aquifer the orientation of the fractures have pronounced control rather than the slope of ground surface using dem a slope map of the area is prepared which shows the different slope classes a slope map has been prepared according to following class intervals very gentle 0 11 gentle 11 20 moderate 20 26 steep 26 33 and very steep slope 33 53 as shown in fig 2b the western part of the study area is represented by steeper slope while northern part is having moderate slope and the area around the river at central part is gentle slope flat to gentle slope area is categorized by very good category for groundwater storage due to the nearly flat terrain slow of surface runoff allowing more time for rainwater to percolate prasad et al 2008 majority of the study area lies within very steep slope which favors to high runoff jha et al 2007 a large amount of runoff and a smaller amount of inﬁltration are associated with areas with steep elevation angle 3 2 3 land use land use controls have a great impact on many hydro geological processes in the water cycle viz evapotranspiration infiltration surface runoff etc kiran kumar et al 2017 the land use of the study area is characterized by a mixture of forest cultivation bushes sandy area water body river stream barren land and settlement which is shown in fig 2c among the various units bushes and cultivated land cover occupies maximum areal extent in the study area settlements are mostly associated with the cultivation and the vegetation forest as well as grass and bush area occupy dominantly in the study area cultivated land water body and sandy areas are considered to exhibits moderate to good groundwater potential since infiltration is high meanwhile bushes barren land and settlement are found to be the least suitable for infiltration which shows poor potential of groundwater occurrence respectively 3 2 4 drainage density drainage density is an inverse function of permeability of soil or rock which is an important parameter in groundwater zone assessment arulbalaji et al 2019 low drainage density is generally found in the areas of highly resistant or permeable subsoil material low relief and dense vegetation similarly high drainage density is found in the areas of sparse vegetation weak or impermeable subsurface material and mountainous relief choudhari et al 2014 the less permeable a rock means less the infiltration of rainfall which conversely tends to be concentrated in surface runoff the drainage network within the area was extracted from the digital topographic map and updated from the satellite image drainage density map is prepared from the drainage map which is grouped into three classes namely low 0 2 38 km km2 moderate 2 38 4 87 km km2 and high 4 87 11 94 km km2 drainage density the drainage density map is shown in fig 2d the map shows that most of the study area is covered by moderate to low drainage density that refers to more infiltration and recharge to the groundwater 3 2 5 geomorphology the geomorphology of area has been studied based on visual interpretation of satellite image along with digital elevation model dem and selective field verifications four major geomorphic units are broadly delineated viz highly dissected hills moderately dissected hills less dissected hills and river valley fig 2e the high dissected hill possesses materials with very low porosity it mainly forms the zones of run off and overland flow the moderately dissected hills in general serve as potential recharge area with equally high capacity to facilities profile run off there suggestive of its moderate potential less dissected hills cover major part of the study area which offer a better groundwater storage siwarkar et al 2010 degree and depth of weathering is relatively more in less dissected hills which facilitate groundwater recharge 3 2 6 lineament and lineament density lineaments have been identified from the satellite image and the geological map of the study area the lineament map fig 2f was then prepared by digitizing the lineaments in google earth and then extracted in gis the lineament density map is classified into three categories high density moderate density and low density the lineament density map shows that the high lineament density area falls in the central part of the study area the purpose of the lineament analysis is to improve the understanding of the relationship between the surface water penetration and fracture systems controlling the water mobility and infiltration presence of lineaments which acts as a pathway for groundwater movement results in increased secondary porosity and therefore can serve as groundwater potential zone obiefuna et al 2010 based on the lineament density factors low density areas are having the higher runoff and high density areas are having the higher rate of infiltration thus the high lineament density is a potential location for groundwater infiltration relative to the low lineament density area celik 2019 3 2 7 rock and soil distribution the soil and rock distribution in an area normally suggest the recharge permeability and storativity of the groundwater the rock and soil distribution map of the area was prepared using satellite image and field investigation fig 2g the study area is divided into four classes namely alluvium colluviums rock and residual soil major portion of the study area is covered by colluvium which consists of relatively impermeable material with limited infiltration than the alluvium the soil and rock distribution in an area contribute in groundwater availability either in unconsolidated sediment or hard rock in addition the rock and soil distribution map can also be interpreted with respect to the different hydrogeologic setting the rock exposure area can be considered as recharge to fracture aquifer as far as the rocks are fractured the lineament map can provide this information once the water enters through the joints it flows through the fractured aquifer system that either reappears on the surface as spring on fractured rock or it recharges to the overlying unconsolidated sediments either on the colluvial materials on the hill slope or to the alluvial materials on the low lying areas at the valley the unconsolidated materials at the hill slope normally forms unconfined aquifer system while at the low lying area in the valley it may form both the unconfined and confined aquifer system 3 2 8 rainfall rainfall determines the amount of water that would be available to percolate into the groundwater system there is only one rainfall station in the study area so the rainfall map of the study area is acquired from the national isohyetal map dhm 2017b the rainfall map fig 2h was classified into three classes namely 1545 1659 1659 1792 and 1792 1943 mm year it is observed that southern part of the area receive the largest amount of rainfall while the northern part receives the lowest amount of rainfall high rainfall is favorable for high groundwater potential 3 2 9 rank and weight assignment to the thematic layers the ground water potential zones were obtained by overlaying all the thematic factor maps in terms of weighted overlay methods all thematic maps were converted into raster format and reclassified the weights and ranks for thematic layer and their classes were assigned as per their significance in groundwater occurrence the knowledge gained from field observation with respect to the occurrence of groundwater was evaluated for each factor map and their classes and respective weight and rank values were assigned the higher values refers to most suitable and the lower values less suitable for the thematic layer that has more than three classes some were given equal ranks because of their similar equal contribution during weighted overlay analysis the weight given for each thematic layers and ranks assigned to the classes are as shown in table 2 the influence of all factors does not have to be the same in an area therefore the weight and rank varies depending on its influence on the movement and storage of groundwater the total weightage value is defined to be 100 which is distributed to different thematic layers as per the importance to occurrence of groundwater the maximum value is given to the factor map that has highest control for occurrence of groundwater and minimum being to the factor map that has lowest control similarly the rank value to each class of the thematic layers has been assigned based on relative contribution to the groundwater occurrence rank and weight were assigned to each layer 3 2 10 groundwater potential map and validation the thematic maps of elevation geomorphology rock and soil distribution slope land use lineament density drainage density and rainfall were integrated for delineating groundwater potential zones in the study area the groundwater potential zone of the study area has been classified into three zones namely low moderate and high potential zones fig 3 in order to validate the method used to delineate groundwater potential the groundwater potential map was then compared with the existing springs in the study area altogether 33 springs were surveyed in the study area three type of spring was found in the study area depression spring contact spring and fracture spring depression spring was the dominant spring in the study area where sediment composition were of clay sand cobble pebbles and boulders fracture spring was found mostly in meta sandstone and the contact spring occurred at the interface of overlying sediments and underlying bedrock the springs found in study area are then cross checked with the groundwater potential map fig 4 it is observed that 16 springs fall within high potential zone whereas 12 springs lie within moderate potential zone and only 5 springs lie within the low potential zones these five springs falling within the low potential zones appear seepage throughout the year while the springs that belong to high groundwater potential zone are categorized by high discharge this shows that the demarcated groundwater potential zones are in good agreement with the field condition 3 3 water poverty index mapping water poverty mapping is a reliable approach towards assessing water scarcity shalamzari and zhang 2018 wpi combines measures of water availability and access which measures the capacity of people on access to water furthermore the wpi tries to establish an international measure that compares performance in the water sector across countries in a holistic manner considering diverse aspects and issues lawrence et al 2002 the value ranges from 0 to 100 representing lowest and highest indices regarding the five components of wpi in which nepal scores 54 4 wwf 2012 nepal is poor in access and capacity sub indices thereby has a low score in order to calculate the wpi for the study area several data were used for respective components sub indices that were obtained from various sources table 3 table 3 is based on wpi structure along with components indicators and variables modified from sullivan 2001 sullivan et al 2006 lawrence et al 2002 sullivan et al 2003 sullivan and meigh 2007 and ty et al 2010 based on the above data collected from different sources the calculation of each component of wpi for respective vdcs is shown below in table 4 a b c d and e respectively sensitivity analysis of wpi has been carried out assigning different weight for each component and thus obtained values is shown in table 5 and graph is plotted to tally calculated value of different weighing options of wpi in fig 5 sensitivity analysis of wpi thus carried out assigning different weight for each component shows that there is no variation in score for vdcs in all five cases bhatauli stands at the low value while manthali scores high therefore the components which are used for developing wpi framework in the studied area are assigned with equal weights i e case v of table 5 is followed the distribution of values of wpi components in the study area is shown in fig 6 the three classes of each component are obtained through equal interval classification of the respective data range the pentagram plot fig 7 allows for easy visualization highlighting differences in component values and directing attention to those areas of the water sector which most need policy attention in accordance with the wpi manthali exhibits the best water situation while the bhatauli exhibits the worst see fig 8 the wpi of study area ranges from 39 90 to 54 04 with the lowest value at bhatauli vdc and the highest value at manthali vdc water poverty map depicts manthali vdc are in a range of very low water poverty which means the water situation is better among the three vdc s taken for survey in these areas public water supply is well established and the economic and social situation is relatively well developed compared to the remaining areas kathjor and chisapani region has a medium level score which characterizes them as neutral bhatauli has low wpi value 39 90 access component shows better off situation than any other wpi components all the four vdcs score lower than the water poverty index score for nepal i e 54 4 4 comparison between water poverty map and groundwater potential map the water supply and sanitation access data is an indicative whether the basic needs of a population are currently being met however it does not sufficiently explain the issues that a country is facing in meeting those needs chenoweth 2008 in this context it is reasonable to compare the water poverty map and groundwater potential map of an area when both maps are analyzed the area which has low potential zone corresponds to low wpi this implies that bhatauli is first in priority area for action to be taken and to monitor progress towards targets than remaining vdcs kathjor and chisapani vdcs show both medium potential groundwater zone and in wpi component score manthali vdc has areas of high potential zone where wpi component score is also high although wpi had found a great relevance in the sustainable water management sector in policy making there are few defects in the index it is based upon the social interviews and data s a single number alone cannot reveal anything about the complexity of water issues so it s not scientific method and may not have accuracy on the actual situation of the study area whereas groundwater potential zone delineation through gis is the systematic scientific and world widely accepted way to delineate groundwater zone and have more accuracy than wpi 5 conclusions some of the physico chemical parameters shows that the spring water meets nepalese drinking quality standards indicating that the people using spring water have access to potable water water poverty index calculation was carried out for each of the vdcs which allow monitoring of a combination of aspects affecting rural water management including water sources access to and use of water the human capacity to manage water and environmental impacts the bhatauli vdc is in critical state and should be prioritized for action leading to better water management however all the vdcs considered in the present study score lower wpi than the score for nepal suggesting that the area should be given more attention towards reducing water poverty moreover the approach made in the present study through comparing groundwater potential map and water poverty index has brought a new concept that groundwater potential mapping may suggest water poverty in an area the reasonable agreement between the low groundwater potential and low water poverty index wpi scores suggest that groundwater potential mapping alone can represent the water availability in an area especially in the mid hill region of nepal himalaya this approach would lead to rapid assessment of water poverty in an area through the limited field survey and utilizing physical parameters instead of extensive field work and public consultation groundwater potential zone delineation shows that the study area has high areas with a low potential zone which means that the area is less favorable to groundwater low groundwater potential zones are characterized by a high water scarcity and very few springs that become dry during the pre monsoon period suggesting the necessary action to improve the condition of water availability for the future the fracture springs are mostly distributed in the central east part while the contact springs are found in easternmost and westernmost part of the study area however the depression spring are distributed throughout the study area in a fractured aquifer the frequency and orientation of joints control the flow and storage of the aquifer maharjan and eckstein 2013 showed that orientations of joints that were linked to tectonics stresses had a significant impact on groundwater flow we recommend a further study on the linkage between joint orientations and the occurrence of the springs we hypothesis that the occurrence of springs orientation would match with the predominant joint orientations declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the central department of geology tribhuvan university for providing field equipments authors would like to thank department of hydrology and meteorology dhm department of survey and central bureau of statistics cbs nepal for providing required data records for the study we would also like to extend our sincere thanks to the editor and anonymous reviewers for their constructive suggestions and comments that has greatly improved the quality of this work

basin shrestha et al 2016 the storage of groundwater is manifested in the form of springs which are the major source of drinking water for people residing in these regions these sources are drying in the region at the faster rate in the recent times due to the consequences of climate change joshi and dongol 2018 the scarcity of water has bigger and negative impact on socioeconomic status of the people living in the region since the region frequently experiences water scarcity during pre monsoon season in the event of drought the assessment of water availability and delineation of groundwater potential zones are vital for socioeconomic growth of the people living in the region identification of groundwater potential gwp zones through remote sensing rs and geographic information system gis is an important step towards maximizing water availability in water shortage area delineating the ground water potential zones using rs and gis have been carried out by a number of researchers around the world chi and lee 1994 krishnamurthy et al 1996 das et al 1997 thomas et al 1999 sankar 2002 leblanc et al 2003 sener et al 2005 yeh et al 2009 magesh et al 2012 singh et al 2012 2013 2015 2018 2020 bagyaraj et al 2013 paudel et al 2014 yadav et al 2014 2016 2020 ali et al 2015 szabó et al 2015 thakur et al 2015 pathak and shrestha 2016 nag and kundu 2016 bashe 2017 hussein et al 2017 pathak 2017 rajasekhar et al 2018 choudhari et al 2018 kumar et al 2018 nemcic jurec et al 2019 pande et al 2020 pathak and gautam 2019 pradhan et al 2020 the water poverty index wpi introduced by sullivan 2002 is a holistic tool for the conceptualization of water strategies many researchers have applied wpi concept in various form to compare water resources across countries and region lawrence et al 2002 sullivan et al 2003 2006 cullis and o regan 2004 manandhar et al 2012 hems 2016 thakur et al 2017 anju et al 2017 four village development committees vdcs in ramechhap district one of the drought prone districts of nepal joshi and dongol 2018 was chosen to study water availability and to assess the potential groundwater accumulation zones the average rainfall of manthali area in last 10 years found drastically lower which is less than 1000 mm that clearly indicates the area is being drought in compare to previous years this has resulted in drying of springs resulting water shortage in the study area the main objective of this study is to establish relationship between gwp and wpi the calculation of wpi is social science approach that demands many data that are difficult to assess for small administrative units hence requiring robust field data collection through consultation with the community and other stakeholder consumes more time and also requires significant data screening the quantitative data is helpful to quantify the water situation while qualitative data provides insights on adequacy of resources services or institutions thereby improving the understanding so as to prioritize the specific issues wilk and jonson 2013 on the other hand the groundwater potential mapping is physical science approach that can be conducted with rapid field data collection mainly spring inventory largely using the satellite imageries and aerial photographs to extract relevant data using available geological map and digital topographic data therefore once the groundwater potential map in the mountainous area could be used as an indicator for water poverty index it could greatly help in water resources management leading towards provisioning for water allocations at the areas of water deficiency because the low groundwater potential is an indication of limited occurrence of springs which is a major source of drinking water resulting in low water availability 1 1 study area the study area lies in ramechhap district mid hill region of nepal himalaya and incorporates four village development committees vdcs namely manthali bhatauli chisapani and kathjor in lower reaches of tamakoshi sub basin geographically the study area extends from 27 28 n to 27 50 n latitude and 85 50 e to 86 35 e longitude and covers an area of about 73 km2 fig 1 geologically the study area lies in the lesser himalaya and the study area entirely lies in kunchha formation that is predominantly consisting of phyllite with metasandstone and schist dhital 2015 there are mainly three types of aquifers in the area namely fractured aquifer on the bedrock unconfined aquifers in unconsolidated sediment mostly colluviums on the slope and both confined as well as unconfined aquifers at the fluvial sediments on the river valley the fracture springs are distributed in the central east part while the contact springs are confined to easternmost and westernmost part of the study area the depression springs are randomly distributed within the study area ramechhap is home to various different indigenous groups in nepal majority of people living in the study area are tamang sherpa gurung chhetri newar and majhi s the people living in this area are highly marginalized and economically vulnerable agriculture is the major source of income for the people living here however the productiveness of agriculture is seasonal and the majority of people is dependent on day to day labor for wages the land use of the study area is characterized by a mixture of forest cultivation bushes sandy area water body river stream barren land and settlement the district is the pocket area of sweet orange citrius sinencis locally known as junar major crops grown in the district are maize paddy millet wheat barley grain legumes oil seeds and potato the district is totally bounded by three main river systems of saptakoshi namely sunkoshi tamakoshi and likhu the major river that fall in the study area is tamakoshi river which flows from northeast to southwest and contain tributaries like ranjor khola sukhajor khola bhatauli khola thedi khola karkale khola kathjor khola lipe khola and mahadev khola the domestic water requirement is poorly met by the surface water as the settlements are situated at higher elevation and the river flows through the deeper valleys 2 materials and methods hydrogeological observations were carried out in the study area collecting lithological information updating landuse map preparing geomorphic map etc in addition in situ physico chemical measurement of spring water samples were carried out measuring hydrogen ion concentration ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds and dissolved oxygen do groundwater potential map was prepared in gis using effective controlling factors like slope elevation drainage density land use geomorphology lineament density rock and soil distribution and rainfall that influence the occurrence movement yield and quality of groundwater the geological map hasn t been used due to monotonous lithology within the study area slope elevation land use and drainage density maps were prepared from the digital topographic map of the department of survey while geomorphology and lineaments were extracted from satellite image the rainfall data in digital form was obtained from department of hydrology and meteorology government of nepal dhm 2017a ranks and weights were assigned to each thematic layer and its classes based on their significance for groundwater occurrence and field condition the output map obtained from overlay operation in gis was classified into three classes namely low moderate and high this study uses the wpi method to depict the water poverty situation in the studied area the wpi calculation is based on available secondary hydrological meteorological and socio demographic data and primary data were collected from community interviews during field investigations the five key components for the calculation of wpi are resource r access a capacity c use u and environment e which are the primary factors affecting water scarcity in a region the wpi is calculated for an area described by sullivan et al 2003 w p i w r r w a a w u u w c c w e e w a w r w u w c w e where wr wa wu wc and we are weights applied respectively to resource access use capacity and environment these weights are constrained to be non negative and sum to unity each of the components is standardized so that the value of wpi falls between 0 and 100 the highest value 100 is taken to describe the best situation whilst the worst is 0 sullivan et al 2003 anju et al 2017 each of the five components consists of a number of sub components and a weighting can be applied to each component to indicate the components importance sullivan et al 2002 compiled weighting groups as shown in table 1 to be added to wpi structure based on the local condition of the study area each five component is calculated by following methods in this study the minimum benchmark level for all components is 0 and the maximum benchmark level is 100 resource the resource component considers physical availability and variability of water resources availability r1 the r1 was measured by per capita annual water resource it was normalized using min max approach as shown below r 1 x i x m i n x m a x x m i n 100 where x i is per capita annual water resources m3 x m i n and x m a x are maximum and minimum values of that in the datasets considered for normalization variability r2 it measures variation of water resources over space and time and therefore is a measure of reliability of available water resources coefficient of variation cv of rainfall was calculated by following formula c v σ x 100 where σ standard deviation and x mean the variability in rainfall was calculated as the variation coefficient of the average annual rainfall between the period 1981 and 2016 as measured in the only one meteorological station in the study area at manthali therefore the spatial variation over the area couldn t be assessed and the value of coefficient of variation cv of rainfall is considered same constant for all vdc s the resource component value is therefore merely the average of the two subcomponents which is calculated as r r1 r2 2 use domestic and agricultural two major water uses were considered as indicators of use domestic water use u1 it was measured by water use per capita per day and normalized using min max approach where the min minimum water requirement for domestic hygiene was taken as 20 l per capita per day lpcd and max water ceiling that fulfills all water requirements was taken as 100 lpcd u 1 x i x m i n x m a x x m i n 100 where x i is domestic water use lpcd x m i n 20 lpcd and x m a x 100 lpcd u1 100 if x i 100 a n d u 1 0 i f x i 20 agricultural water use u2 the ratio of irrigated land to total cultivated land expressed in percentage is used as a proxy to assess the agricultural water use sullivan et al 2003 u 2 x i x 100 where x i and x are total irrigated and total cultivated areas respectively the use component value is therefore merely the average of the two subcomponents and is calculated as u u1 u2 2 access the access considers population with reasonable access to an adequate amount of safe drinking water and sanitation for better health and well being the two indicators access to water supply a1 and sanitation a2 are calculated a 1 x w x 100 a 2 x s x 100 where x w x s are population with water supply sanitation facility and x is the total population in the study area the access component is the average values of water supply and sanitation coverage which is calculated as a a1 a2 2 capacity the capacity is interpreted in terms of economic capacity and social capacity literacy rate c1i it is defined as the percentage of literate population aged 15 years and above that can read and write it is expressed as c 1 i x i x 100 where x i and x are the literate and total populations respectively economically active population c1ii it is defined as working age people lying between the ages of 10 60 years c 1 ii x i x 100 where x i and x denotes population under 10 60 years and total population respectively gdp index c2i it measures a decent standard of living in terms of gross domestic product gdp per capita income undp 2009 it was normalized to a comparable range of 0 100 as shown below gdp index c 2 i log per capita income log min log max log min 100 where the maximum max and minimum min values are set at 40 000 and 100 respectively as used by undp 2009 in calculating human development index nonagricultural employment c2ii it was calculated using following formula c 2 i i x i x 100 where x i and x are population involved in nonagricultural employment and total population respectively the capacity component value is therefore the average of four subcomponents and is calculated as c c1i c1ii c2i c2ii 4 environment this component is evaluated by two indicators environmental stress e1 and vegetation coverage e2 environmental stress e1 amount of chemical fertilizer use reflects environmental stress it was calculated as e 1 x max x i x m a x x m i n 100 where x i is the amount kg of chemical fertilizers used per hectare of land and x m a x and x m i n are the maximum and minimum values of the fertilizer used among all datasets considered for normalization vegetation coverage e2 the percentage of area covered by forest grass and wetlands is taken as vegetation coverage it is calculated as e 2 x i x 100 where x i and x represents vegetation coverage and total area including vegetation coverage and other land uses respectively the environment component value is therefore the average of two subcomponents and is calculated as e e1 e2 2 3 results and discussions 3 1 groundwater quality in situ chemical analysis of the 33 spring water samples revealed that the measured hydrogen ion concentration ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds and dissolved oxygen do of spring water is within the concentration limits of nepal drinking water quality standards ndqs 2005 and suitable for drinking or other beneficial uses the ph value ranges from 5 57 to 6 68 suggesting that the spring water is slightly acidic in nature likewise the ec value lies between 70 and 260 μs cm which indicates that the water are slightly to weakly mineralized detay 1997 the total dissolved solid tds values ranges from 68 to 260 mg l which shows that the water can be categorized as fresh water todd 2007 3 2 groundwater potential mapping various thematic layers that favor the groundwater occurrence have been integrated and a groundwater potential map has been prepared in gis the thematic maps factor maps used for the groundwater potential mapping in this study are briefly described below 3 2 1 elevation topography determines the direction of storm runoff over the ground surface gentle areas with lower elevation have a tendency to retain water longer inducing higher inﬁltration of recharge of water thapa et al 2017 higher elevation zones in the study area has few springs indicating that the recharge zone has low spring occurrence which is also evidenced in the other geographical regions e g sener et al 2005 the digital elevation model dem has been prepared from the contours available on the digital topographic data of the department of survey fig 2 a the central part of the study area is represented by low elevation while the eastern and western region have high elevations the ground surface elevation in the study area is classified into five different classes ranging from 465 m to 2000 m above mean sea level in terms of elevation the springs were located at the altitude ranging from 520 m to 1424 m 3 2 2 slope slope is one of the most important factors controlling the configuration of water table potentiometric surface and hence to the occurrence and movement of groundwater slope can be considered as an important factor in runoff and possible infiltration tiwari et al 2017 unconfined aquifer is more controlled by slope however for fractured aquifer the orientation of the fractures have pronounced control rather than the slope of ground surface using dem a slope map of the area is prepared which shows the different slope classes a slope map has been prepared according to following class intervals very gentle 0 11 gentle 11 20 moderate 20 26 steep 26 33 and very steep slope 33 53 as shown in fig 2b the western part of the study area is represented by steeper slope while northern part is having moderate slope and the area around the river at central part is gentle slope flat to gentle slope area is categorized by very good category for groundwater storage due to the nearly flat terrain slow of surface runoff allowing more time for rainwater to percolate prasad et al 2008 majority of the study area lies within very steep slope which favors to high runoff jha et al 2007 a large amount of runoff and a smaller amount of inﬁltration are associated with areas with steep elevation angle 3 2 3 land use land use controls have a great impact on many hydro geological processes in the water cycle viz evapotranspiration infiltration surface runoff etc kiran kumar et al 2017 the land use of the study area is characterized by a mixture of forest cultivation bushes sandy area water body river stream barren land and settlement which is shown in fig 2c among the various units bushes and cultivated land cover occupies maximum areal extent in the study area settlements are mostly associated with the cultivation and the vegetation forest as well as grass and bush area occupy dominantly in the study area cultivated land water body and sandy areas are considered to exhibits moderate to good groundwater potential since infiltration is high meanwhile bushes barren land and settlement are found to be the least suitable for infiltration which shows poor potential of groundwater occurrence respectively 3 2 4 drainage density drainage density is an inverse function of permeability of soil or rock which is an important parameter in groundwater zone assessment arulbalaji et al 2019 low drainage density is generally found in the areas of highly resistant or permeable subsoil material low relief and dense vegetation similarly high drainage density is found in the areas of sparse vegetation weak or impermeable subsurface material and mountainous relief choudhari et al 2014 the less permeable a rock means less the infiltration of rainfall which conversely tends to be concentrated in surface runoff the drainage network within the area was extracted from the digital topographic map and updated from the satellite image drainage density map is prepared from the drainage map which is grouped into three classes namely low 0 2 38 km km2 moderate 2 38 4 87 km km2 and high 4 87 11 94 km km2 drainage density the drainage density map is shown in fig 2d the map shows that most of the study area is covered by moderate to low drainage density that refers to more infiltration and recharge to the groundwater 3 2 5 geomorphology the geomorphology of area has been studied based on visual interpretation of satellite image along with digital elevation model dem and selective field verifications four major geomorphic units are broadly delineated viz highly dissected hills moderately dissected hills less dissected hills and river valley fig 2e the high dissected hill possesses materials with very low porosity it mainly forms the zones of run off and overland flow the moderately dissected hills in general serve as potential recharge area with equally high capacity to facilities profile run off there suggestive of its moderate potential less dissected hills cover major part of the study area which offer a better groundwater storage siwarkar et al 2010 degree and depth of weathering is relatively more in less dissected hills which facilitate groundwater recharge 3 2 6 lineament and lineament density lineaments have been identified from the satellite image and the geological map of the study area the lineament map fig 2f was then prepared by digitizing the lineaments in google earth and then extracted in gis the lineament density map is classified into three categories high density moderate density and low density the lineament density map shows that the high lineament density area falls in the central part of the study area the purpose of the lineament analysis is to improve the understanding of the relationship between the surface water penetration and fracture systems controlling the water mobility and infiltration presence of lineaments which acts as a pathway for groundwater movement results in increased secondary porosity and therefore can serve as groundwater potential zone obiefuna et al 2010 based on the lineament density factors low density areas are having the higher runoff and high density areas are having the higher rate of infiltration thus the high lineament density is a potential location for groundwater infiltration relative to the low lineament density area celik 2019 3 2 7 rock and soil distribution the soil and rock distribution in an area normally suggest the recharge permeability and storativity of the groundwater the rock and soil distribution map of the area was prepared using satellite image and field investigation fig 2g the study area is divided into four classes namely alluvium colluviums rock and residual soil major portion of the study area is covered by colluvium which consists of relatively impermeable material with limited infiltration than the alluvium the soil and rock distribution in an area contribute in groundwater availability either in unconsolidated sediment or hard rock in addition the rock and soil distribution map can also be interpreted with respect to the different hydrogeologic setting the rock exposure area can be considered as recharge to fracture aquifer as far as the rocks are fractured the lineament map can provide this information once the water enters through the joints it flows through the fractured aquifer system that either reappears on the surface as spring on fractured rock or it recharges to the overlying unconsolidated sediments either on the colluvial materials on the hill slope or to the alluvial materials on the low lying areas at the valley the unconsolidated materials at the hill slope normally forms unconfined aquifer system while at the low lying area in the valley it may form both the unconfined and confined aquifer system 3 2 8 rainfall rainfall determines the amount of water that would be available to percolate into the groundwater system there is only one rainfall station in the study area so the rainfall map of the study area is acquired from the national isohyetal map dhm 2017b the rainfall map fig 2h was classified into three classes namely 1545 1659 1659 1792 and 1792 1943 mm year it is observed that southern part of the area receive the largest amount of rainfall while the northern part receives the lowest amount of rainfall high rainfall is favorable for high groundwater potential 3 2 9 rank and weight assignment to the thematic layers the ground water potential zones were obtained by overlaying all the thematic factor maps in terms of weighted overlay methods all thematic maps were converted into raster format and reclassified the weights and ranks for thematic layer and their classes were assigned as per their significance in groundwater occurrence the knowledge gained from field observation with respect to the occurrence of groundwater was evaluated for each factor map and their classes and respective weight and rank values were assigned the higher values refers to most suitable and the lower values less suitable for the thematic layer that has more than three classes some were given equal ranks because of their similar equal contribution during weighted overlay analysis the weight given for each thematic layers and ranks assigned to the classes are as shown in table 2 the influence of all factors does not have to be the same in an area therefore the weight and rank varies depending on its influence on the movement and storage of groundwater the total weightage value is defined to be 100 which is distributed to different thematic layers as per the importance to occurrence of groundwater the maximum value is given to the factor map that has highest control for occurrence of groundwater and minimum being to the factor map that has lowest control similarly the rank value to each class of the thematic layers has been assigned based on relative contribution to the groundwater occurrence rank and weight were assigned to each layer 3 2 10 groundwater potential map and validation the thematic maps of elevation geomorphology rock and soil distribution slope land use lineament density drainage density and rainfall were integrated for delineating groundwater potential zones in the study area the groundwater potential zone of the study area has been classified into three zones namely low moderate and high potential zones fig 3 in order to validate the method used to delineate groundwater potential the groundwater potential map was then compared with the existing springs in the study area altogether 33 springs were surveyed in the study area three type of spring was found in the study area depression spring contact spring and fracture spring depression spring was the dominant spring in the study area where sediment composition were of clay sand cobble pebbles and boulders fracture spring was found mostly in meta sandstone and the contact spring occurred at the interface of overlying sediments and underlying bedrock the springs found in study area are then cross checked with the groundwater potential map fig 4 it is observed that 16 springs fall within high potential zone whereas 12 springs lie within moderate potential zone and only 5 springs lie within the low potential zones these five springs falling within the low potential zones appear seepage throughout the year while the springs that belong to high groundwater potential zone are categorized by high discharge this shows that the demarcated groundwater potential zones are in good agreement with the field condition 3 3 water poverty index mapping water poverty mapping is a reliable approach towards assessing water scarcity shalamzari and zhang 2018 wpi combines measures of water availability and access which measures the capacity of people on access to water furthermore the wpi tries to establish an international measure that compares performance in the water sector across countries in a holistic manner considering diverse aspects and issues lawrence et al 2002 the value ranges from 0 to 100 representing lowest and highest indices regarding the five components of wpi in which nepal scores 54 4 wwf 2012 nepal is poor in access and capacity sub indices thereby has a low score in order to calculate the wpi for the study area several data were used for respective components sub indices that were obtained from various sources table 3 table 3 is based on wpi structure along with components indicators and variables modified from sullivan 2001 sullivan et al 2006 lawrence et al 2002 sullivan et al 2003 sullivan and meigh 2007 and ty et al 2010 based on the above data collected from different sources the calculation of each component of wpi for respective vdcs is shown below in table 4 a b c d and e respectively sensitivity analysis of wpi has been carried out assigning different weight for each component and thus obtained values is shown in table 5 and graph is plotted to tally calculated value of different weighing options of wpi in fig 5 sensitivity analysis of wpi thus carried out assigning different weight for each component shows that there is no variation in score for vdcs in all five cases bhatauli stands at the low value while manthali scores high therefore the components which are used for developing wpi framework in the studied area are assigned with equal weights i e case v of table 5 is followed the distribution of values of wpi components in the study area is shown in fig 6 the three classes of each component are obtained through equal interval classification of the respective data range the pentagram plot fig 7 allows for easy visualization highlighting differences in component values and directing attention to those areas of the water sector which most need policy attention in accordance with the wpi manthali exhibits the best water situation while the bhatauli exhibits the worst see fig 8 the wpi of study area ranges from 39 90 to 54 04 with the lowest value at bhatauli vdc and the highest value at manthali vdc water poverty map depicts manthali vdc are in a range of very low water poverty which means the water situation is better among the three vdc s taken for survey in these areas public water supply is well established and the economic and social situation is relatively well developed compared to the remaining areas kathjor and chisapani region has a medium level score which characterizes them as neutral bhatauli has low wpi value 39 90 access component shows better off situation than any other wpi components all the four vdcs score lower than the water poverty index score for nepal i e 54 4 4 comparison between water poverty map and groundwater potential map the water supply and sanitation access data is an indicative whether the basic needs of a population are currently being met however it does not sufficiently explain the issues that a country is facing in meeting those needs chenoweth 2008 in this context it is reasonable to compare the water poverty map and groundwater potential map of an area when both maps are analyzed the area which has low potential zone corresponds to low wpi this implies that bhatauli is first in priority area for action to be taken and to monitor progress towards targets than remaining vdcs kathjor and chisapani vdcs show both medium potential groundwater zone and in wpi component score manthali vdc has areas of high potential zone where wpi component score is also high although wpi had found a great relevance in the sustainable water management sector in policy making there are few defects in the index it is based upon the social interviews and data s a single number alone cannot reveal anything about the complexity of water issues so it s not scientific method and may not have accuracy on the actual situation of the study area whereas groundwater potential zone delineation through gis is the systematic scientific and world widely accepted way to delineate groundwater zone and have more accuracy than wpi 5 conclusions some of the physico chemical parameters shows that the spring water meets nepalese drinking quality standards indicating that the people using spring water have access to potable water water poverty index calculation was carried out for each of the vdcs which allow monitoring of a combination of aspects affecting rural water management including water sources access to and use of water the human capacity to manage water and environmental impacts the bhatauli vdc is in critical state and should be prioritized for action leading to better water management however all the vdcs considered in the present study score lower wpi than the score for nepal suggesting that the area should be given more attention towards reducing water poverty moreover the approach made in the present study through comparing groundwater potential map and water poverty index has brought a new concept that groundwater potential mapping may suggest water poverty in an area the reasonable agreement between the low groundwater potential and low water poverty index wpi scores suggest that groundwater potential mapping alone can represent the water availability in an area especially in the mid hill region of nepal himalaya this approach would lead to rapid assessment of water poverty in an area through the limited field survey and utilizing physical parameters instead of extensive field work and public consultation groundwater potential zone delineation shows that the study area has high areas with a low potential zone which means that the area is less favorable to groundwater low groundwater potential zones are characterized by a high water scarcity and very few springs that become dry during the pre monsoon period suggesting the necessary action to improve the condition of water availability for the future the fracture springs are mostly distributed in the central east part while the contact springs are found in easternmost and westernmost part of the study area however the depression spring are distributed throughout the study area in a fractured aquifer the frequency and orientation of joints control the flow and storage of the aquifer maharjan and eckstein 2013 showed that orientations of joints that were linked to tectonics stresses had a significant impact on groundwater flow we recommend a further study on the linkage between joint orientations and the occurrence of the springs we hypothesis that the occurrence of springs orientation would match with the predominant joint orientations declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

feasible and low cost measurement to identify as and manganese tompsett et al 2019 provide the policy to improve the access to drinking water through interventions by using experiments in the fields the study investigates the quality of as in drinking water from the tubewells in the region and also estimate the relationship between depth and the associated concentration of as in tubewells the paper is organised in the following manner following the introduction materials and methods used are described the findings and discussions are presented in the next section the last section concludes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area bihar is the thirteenth largest indian state in terms of geographical area with 94 163 km2 the third largest state in population with 103 8 million literacy rate of 63 8 percent and population density with 1102 km2 census 2011 bihar is located at latitude of 240 20 10 270 31 15 n and longitude of 830 19 50 880 17 40 e the selected study area i e maner is located 25 650 n 84 880 e in the district of patna and shahpur is located 25 60 n 84 40 e in the district of bhojpur maner and shahpur are one of the most as affected blocks in bihar thakur et al 2013 2019 singh and vedwan 2015 and 1861 μg l and 1630 μg l of as are reported in tubewells reported ghosh et al 2012 mowr 2010a b the surveyed study area of the maner and shahpur is presented in fig 1 2 2 selection of drinking water sources for sampling a total of 935 tubewells were randomly chosen for the study from two blocks comprising 10 villages based on as concentration levels in drinking water and tested two criteria were used to select the water sources for testing 1 water sources used for drinking purposes and 2 water source is functional and operational for throughout the year as suggested by the earlier studies jakariya et al 2007 thakur and gupta 2016 the study area is shown in fig 1 arsenic and iron field test kits were used to check the concentration levels of as and iron in drinking water field test kits manufactured by prerana laboratories pune were used the company is accredited by the world health organisation who and the bureau of indian standards bis water samples were collected during february may 2013 and february may 2019 as discussed in an earlier paper the results of the water samples were based on the strips of the colour used in the field test kit thakur and gupta 2016 van geen et al 2016 and the magnitude of as concentration was identified based on change in the colour of the strip van geen et al 2016 annaduzzaman et al 2018 the following procedures adopted during the time of testing the water samples no change in the colour indicates 0 μg l of as concentration a slight change in colour yellow patch indicates 10 μg l of as light yellow indicates 50 μg l of as deep yellow indicates 100 μg l of as light orange indicates 300 μg l in the samples and dark orange indicates 500 μg l of as concentration in the water finally the colour of the strip and the as concentration were noted as per the colour chart van geen et al 2014 thakur and gupta 2016 annaduzzaman et al 2018 if there was no change in the colour it indicated absence of detectable iron concentration slight pink indicated 100 μg l pink indicated concentration of 300 μg l light dark indicated 500 μg l and dark black indicated more than 1000 μg l around 5 of the water samples were sent to the laboratory to see the change in the result of water sample tested through field test kit and atomic absorption spectroscopy aas methods as suggested by the earlier studies saha et al 2019 in the study the relationship between the depth of the tube well and the as concentration level is examined in earlier scientific hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical studies it was suggested that as concentration is mainly found in the depth of 12 55 m mowr 2010 b van geen et al 2016 the respondents were asked about the depth of the tube well the depth of the tube well in the study area was in the range of 14 76 m depth 2 3 household survey the primary data was collected through a household survey based semi structured questionnaire from february to may 2019 the questionnaire was divided into 2 sections which covered various aspects associated with water and iron related problems the first section aimed to collect information on households awareness of the presence of as and iron in drinking water and overall water quality problems etc the second section collates information on water source and availability of water sources and various uses of water environmental concerns include water related information such as as related issues water quality issues and awareness of water purification methods the study surveyed 388 respondents from both the blocks and found that only 28 5 of the respondents were aware of the water quality problems and their associated health and other socioeconomic issues around 31 5 of the respondents do not have any formal education surveys were also carried out to collect tube well water samples and test the as and iron concentration level information on the depth of the tube well was also collected through the survey 2 4 descriptive statistical analysis the basic summary statistics are presented in table 1 presents the summary statistics the descriptive statistical analysis such as mean range standard deviation frequency distribution and other graphs were calculated by using microsoft office excel 2016 the depth of the tube well and as concentration level is calculated using stata 13 0 and arcgis 10 was used to prepare the location map of the study area saha et al 2019 most of the households use drinking water through the tube well 3 results and discussion 3 1 geology and hydrogeology of the aquifer sediments earlier studies advocate the relationship among the geomorphology groundwater migration fluvial depositional setting and the intensity of the arsenic concentrations but could not explain the scale and basin wide component of the arsenic contamination acharyya and shah 2007 ghosh et al 2015 mukherjee et al 2012 donselaar et al 2017 it indicates the ubiquitous source of microbial respiration which causes the release of arsenic from its solid state donselaar et al 2017 the geology hydrogeology and geomorphological units in the study area are much more noticeable in the bengal basin aquifers and in the central ganges basin the groundwater chemistry described recharge provenance and fate of solutes in as affected areas mukherjee et al 2012 holocene fluvial and deltaic flood basins are the hotspots of as pollution and that the dominant geomorphological setting of the as polluted areas consists of shallow depth meandering river deposits with sand prone fluvial point bar deposits surrounded by clay filled clay plug abandoned meander bends oxbow lakes donselaar et al 2017 the groundwater chemistry in the bengal basin and the study area reflects a variety of differences in the aquifers settings in the geological and geomorphological conditions bhattacharya et al 2007 mukherjee et al 2012 along the ganges river in bihar the data of as concentrations and organic matter content reveals that the low permeable clay plug deposits have a high organic matter content and the adjacent permeable point bar sands show high but spatially very variable as concentrations donselaar et al 2017 the study area encompasses the largest fluvial system and have among the highest yielding aquifers globally mukherjee et al 2015 the lower part of the upper aquifer is more vulnerable to as mobilisation with the increasing water extraction in the river ganges basin saha et al 2011 the geology in the study area is classified as older alluvial deposits of the river ganges and its various tributaries oa active or younger alluvial deposits of the river ganges and its various tributaries ya sediments of the himalayan foothills and pre cenozoic metamorphics and volcanic mukherjee et al 2012 the older alluvium was characterised by the yellow brown clay with abundant calcareous and ferruginous concretions while the newer alluvium has calcareous concretions acharyya and shah 2007 while drilling tubewells local masons identified five different types of sediment colours black white off white buff brown and red and brown off white or red sediment layers are targeted to install tubewells instead of using white and off white sediments which was the case in the past in the study area thakur et al 2019 the east west main active channel of the ganges acts as a geological geomorphological and hydraulic divide between the pre cenozoic cratonic rocks to the south and extensive alluvial deposits to the north mukherjee et al 2012 the main features that were mapped included the river channels older and active alluvial flood plains older and active interfluve plains bedrock outcrops and piedmont deposits mukherjee et al 2012 3 2 depth of tubewell and arsenic levels respondent was asked about the depth of their tubewells to understand the relationship between depths and its associated as and iron contamination levels the depth of the tube well used for drinking water is in the range of 14 76 m the mean depth of the tube well in the study area found to be 32 m the concentration of as contamination is mainly found in the range of 14 49 m in depth in the deep tubewells 49 m depth the as concentration was 10 μg l which is safe for drinking water as prescribed by who and bis an inverse association is found between depth of tubewells and the concentration of as i e higher the depth lesser is the contamination fig 2 a c depicts the detailed analysis of the depth of tubewells and the associated concentration of as in drinking water in shallow and deep tubewells there is a paucity of studies that establish the relationship between depths of tube well and the associated levels of as contamination in drinking water in households private tubewells although a few studies assess the relationship in public wells mowr 2015 van geen et al 2016 although there are almost no data on as levels in irrigation waters these tubewells are for the most part in shallow aquifers 20 70 m that generally have the highest levels of as nickson et al 2000 the results from the field study found that as contamination is mainly found between 14 and 49 m depth fig 2a and b and in deep tubewells 49 m and deeper fig 2c the as concentration levels were less than 50 μg l the findings of the present study support the earlier studies that as is mainly found at the depth of 12 46 m mowr 2010b van geen et al 2014 van geen et al 2016 since the depth of the tube well in the study area is in the range of 14 76 m and among those wells most of them are shallow tube well 49 m both the short and long run health impacts are undeniable 3 3 arsenic concentration in water samples to know the levels of concentration of as contamination water samples were collected and tested from the study area fig 1 the mean concentration of as contamination was found to be 91 36 μg l which is higher than the prescribed standard limit of who and bis of 10 μg l and 50 μg l respectively it appears from the result of water sample analysis that 39 04 of water samples contained as at concentrations 10 μg l 18 1 samples contained concentrations between 11 and 50 μg l 20 8 samples contained in the range of 51 to 100 μg l 15 8 samples contained between 101 and 300 μg l and 5 of the samples had as concentrations between 301 and 500 μg l for the entire study area fig 3 and fig 4 from the analysis of water samples of the maner block it was found that 24 2 of the water samples contained as 10 μg l 19 03 samples contained 11 to 50 μg l 30 7 samples had as in the range of 51 to 100 μg l 19 03 contained as between 101 and 300 μg l and 6 8 of the water samples contained the metal in the range of 301 to 500 μg l fig 3 water sample analysis of kitta chauhattar gps from maner blocks reveals that 29 6 of water samples contained as 10 μg l 16 3 samples contained 11 to 50 μg l 33 7 water samples had as in the range of 51 to 100 μg l 12 5 contained as between 101 and 300 μg l and 7 7 of the water samples contained concentrations in the range of 301 to 500 μg l fig 3 the water sample test of haldi chhapra and rampur diara villages from maner blocks reveals that 18 7 of samples contained as 10 μg l 22 3 samples contained 11 to 50 μg l 27 2 of samples contained as between 51 and 100 μg l 26 7 water samples had as in the range of 51 to 100 μg l and 5 8 of the water samples contained as between 301 and 500 μg l fig 3 the results of the water sample test from the laboratory revealed a similar result where concentration 50 μg l in drinking water where the concentration levels of as in drinking water exceed the 50 μg l level the average contamination was 112 8 μg l in the dudhaila village from maner and dudhghat from shahpur the average contamination level was higher than the other surveyed areas fig 3 presents the analysis of as in water samples from the tube well from kitta chauhattar and haldi chhapra from maner block the water sample analysis revealed that the as concentrations are higher in the gps of maner than in the gps of shahpur from the analysis of water samples of the shahpur block it was found that 55 4 contained as 10 μg l 17 2 contained 11 to 50 μg l 9 7 had as in the range of 51 to 100 μg l 14 5 contained as between 101 and 300 μg l and 2 9 contained the metal in the range of 301 to 500 μg l fig 4 the presence of as in semariya palti ojha gps of shahpur block was more severe than the barsaun gps of the same block the first case of as detection was reported from the semariya palti ojha gps of shahpur block in 2002 chakraborti et al 2003 mowr 2010b water sample analysis of semariya palti ojha gps from shahpur blocks reveals that 43 6 of water samples contained as 10 μg l 13 4 contained 11 to 50 μg l 14 6 had as in the range of 51 to 100 μg l 23 contained as between 101 and 300 μg l and 5 1 contained concentration in the range of 301 to 500 μg l fig 4 while the water sample test of barsaun gps from maner blocks reveals that 71 4 contained as 10 μg l 22 2 contained 11 to 50 μg l 3 1 contained as between 51 and 100 μg l and 3 1 contained as between 101 and 300 μg l and no as concentration found in the range of 301 to 500 μg l fig 4 fig 4 presents the analysis of as in water samples from the tube well from semariya palti ojha and barsaun gps from shahpur block 3 4 iron in water samples the concentration levels of iron from 935 tube well were tested by using a field test kit the water sample analysis of iron in both the blocks revealed that the contamination level of iron in drinking water was similar from the water sample analysis it was found that 74 7 74 15 and 74 44 contained iron higher than the prescribed level of bis from maner shahpur and the study area respectively kitta chauhattar and haldi chhapra water samples from maner block revealed that 78 89 and 69 64 contained more iron than the recommended level for safe drinking water the water samples analysis of semariya palti ojha and barsaun gps from shahpur revealed that 75 79 and 71 96 contained more iron than the bis standard it was found that only 25 56 of samples from the study area are found to be less than the safe level of drinking water fig 5 presents the analysis of iron in water samples from hand pump tubewells from maner shahpur and the study area 3 5 health issues the health problems due to as in drinking water have been classified by who 2011 into primary secondary and tertiary diseases the researcher discussed with the medical team to understand different diseases prevailing due to as in drinking water the majority of the health problems is primary 55 secondary 43 and only around 2 were of tertiary primary health issues are black spots on the body 44 redness of conjunctiva 1 and white black spots on the body 29 non pitting edema 28 is major secondary health issues previous studies suggested that as concentration levels in drinking water over 50 μg l bis standard are likely to cause various skin diseases such as arsenicosis arsenical dermatosis skin lesions keratosis and hyperkeratosis chakraborti et al 2017 haque et al 2003 guha mazumdar 2008 kapaj et al 2006 and if the concentration levels in drinking water continue with more than 300 μg l for a few years it can lead to gangrene and various forms of cancer such as bladder cancer lung cancer and intestine cancer etc bates et al 2004 marshall et al 2007 steinmaus et al 2003 the results from the household survey found that poor households are suffering more due to as induced health problems than the well off households households whose source of drinking water have 300 μg l of as suffers more health issues than those households where concentration level is 50 μg l children are more exposed and susceptible to the adverse effects of as and toxic metals than the adults it is found that in maner 75 3 87 cases of male 79 4 08 female and 46 2 37 children suffer from skin lesions in shahpur 31 2 19 cases of male 41 2 90 female and 43 3 04 children are suffering from skin lesions in the dudhghat village of semariya palti ojha gps and dudhaila rampur diara and haldi chapda villages from kitta chauhattar and haldi chapra gps a group of children are drinking highly contaminated water and are facing skin lesion problems black spots and black and white spot problems among the children on their entire bodies were found study finds children with a skin lesion due to highly contaminated water opposite to earlier studies which suggests children are less exposed to melanosis spotted melanosis keratosis and spotted keratosis rahman et al 2005 chakraborty et al 2016 from the field survey we found that skin and liver problems are more among children chakraborti et al 2003 found that children below the age of 12 years are less prone to as skin lesions in bangladesh and west bengal india the study further suggests exceptions can be there where as concentration is more than 1000 μg l in drinking water and where normally children suffer from malnutrition problem rahman et al 2005 chakraborti et al 2013 2016 although the earlier study suggested that children are less vulnerable to melanosis spotted melanosis keratosis and spotted keratosis rahman et al 2005 chakraborti et al 2013 2017 3 6 awareness we surveyed 388 respondents and their responses to water quality presence of as and iron through a questionnaire and testing of water quality the findings revealed that only 28 5 of the respondents are aware of the presence of as in the drinking water and its associated health impacts around 48 of the respondents were aware of the presence of iron in drinking water but did not know the associated health impacts the literature suggests awareness is helpful to frame policies in disease prone areas nicksic et al 2016 the sustainability of as mitigation singh et al 2018 and exposed threats solely depend on various socioeconomic and demographic conditions scata et al 2016 madajewicz et al 2007 suggested information can reduce household behaviour to avoid the risk it was suggested that with the information about safe well the probability of changing the unsafe well within a year to be 0 37 the study also provides an important dimension in education increases the information probability among the respondents and 10 years of more schooling lead to increase the probability of information from 0 39 to 0 43 for women and 0 08 to 0 32 for men madajewicz et al 2007 the knowledge about as and awareness are useful in as mitigation among those communities with a higher perceived risk of health and economic conditions singh and taylor 2019 it was found that only 13 92 of respondents have taken any defensive measures to remove contamination from their water source the reasons for not taking any defensive activities are multifold such as lack of awareness about defensive activities lack of available appropriate sources and lack of government initiative on providing drinking water households need to be aware of using drinking water from deep hand pump tubewells which are as free 4 conclusions the groundwater contamination problem such as as and iron in india and particularly in bihar is increasing with every year this leads to a serious health problem for the inhabitants who reside in the as contaminated areas in the state of bihar in the present study households drinking water samples were tested for 935 tubes well the results of the water samples revealed that more than 44 of the sample households drinking water sources are having as more than 50 μg l the as concentration in kitta chauhattar and haldi chhapra was more severe than in semariya palti ojha and barsaun around 74 44 of the samples contained iron above the bis levels of safe drinking water the results of the water test in the study area support the results of the previous studies the results of the study found that the households are not aware of the as in drinking water and its associated health problems from the survey it was revealed that 48 of the respondents were aware of the presence of iron in drinking water and its associated problems but only 28 5 of the respondents were aware of the presence of as in drinking water and its associated social economic environmental and health impacts george et al 2012 suggested in their study in bangladesh that household level awareness and education significantly increase the as awareness among households in bangladesh the government of bihar must initiate such awareness and education programmes in the affected areas with as concentration this will further help to achieve as awareness sustainably finally some of the shortcomings of the study are discussed to improve the study for further research the study can be further extended to use the identification of safe as iron manganese and other heavy metals based on colour based sediment testing in the as affected areas of bihar in the tune of bangladesh for sustainable mitigation on the community level the study captured the depth of the tubewells while collecting the water samples of as and iron for testing through the field test kit since the temporal variability is present in the as concentration it could be a limitation of the study the study used field test kits for testing both iron and as water samples and the concentration level is approximately in the range and not the exact level this could be another limitation the findings of the study will help to provide and formulate the recommendation and to identify the options for safe sources of drinking water in the study area and other regions of the state the present research may be improved further by future researchers on these limitations to

12016,this study assesses the depth of tubewell and the associated concentration of arsenic as in drinking water within the arsenic affected regions in bihar india a survey of 935 tubewell from two as contaminated blocks in bihar were conducted to collect and test the water samples the results demonstrate that as concentration is mainly found in shallow tubewells 14 49 m deep which is the main source of drinking water in the region in deep tubewells 49 m deep have arsenic concentration 50 μg l the analytical results by field test kits ftk revealed that the levels of as in around 61 of the drinking water sources were above 10 μg l 20 8 samples contained arsenic 51 100 μg l 16 9 contained 101 300 μg l and 5 03 of the samples contained arsenic between 300 and 500 μg l iron test results showed that around 74 4 of the samples contained iron at more than the prescribed 500 μg l level of who the study also revealed a general lack of awareness about the drinking water contamination and its associated health impacts therefore awareness through various channels among the affected stakeholders will be helpful for the households to change their water sources saha et al 2019 keywords

colours chemical characteristics and other properties where sediment depth was in the range of depth of 17 82 m hossain et al 2014 developed a sediment colour tool with the help of perceptions of local driller they tested 521 samples taken from 144 tubewells and found higher concentrations of as in black coloured sediments while red coloured sediments have safe water jakariya et al 2007a studied two upazillas in bangladesh by targeting the safe water coverage through alternative safe water options for possible sustainable as mitigation strategy hossain et al 2017 evaluating the sasmit results of five parameters assessing the available sources of safe water and options local tubewells drillers perceptions sediment colour tools for predicting safe source of as intermediate deep

bangladesh and also validated tube well and probable water supply and awareness programs hossain et al 2015 annaduzzaman et al 2018 studied the as and manganese in the tubewells shallow and validated them based on the platform tool colour they found that most of the shallow tube well have as and manganese in drinking water and platform tool colour for tubewell may be used as an alternative feasible and low cost measurement to identify as and manganese tompsett et al 2019 provide the policy to improve the access to drinking water through interventions by using experiments in the fields the study investigates the quality of as in drinking water from the tubewells in the region and also estimate the relationship between depth and the associated concentration of as in tubewells the paper is organised in the following manner following the introduction materials and methods used are described the findings and discussions are presented in the next section the last section concludes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area bihar is the thirteenth largest indian state in terms of geographical area with 94 163 km2 the third largest state in population with 103 8 million literacy rate of 63 8 percent and population density with 1102 km2 census 2011 bihar is located at latitude of 240 20 10 270 31 15 n and longitude of 830 19 50 880 17 40 e the selected study area i e maner is located 25 650 n 84 880 e in the district of patna and shahpur is located 25 60 n 84 40 e in the district of bhojpur maner and shahpur are one of the most as affected blocks in bihar thakur et al 2013 2019 singh and vedwan 2015 and 1861 μg l and 1630 μg l of as are reported in tubewells reported ghosh et al 2012 mowr 2010a b the surveyed study area of the maner and shahpur is presented in fig 1 2 2 selection of drinking water sources for sampling a total of 935 tubewells were randomly chosen for the study from two blocks comprising 10 villages based on as concentration levels in drinking water and tested two criteria were used to select the water sources for testing 1 water sources used for drinking purposes and 2 water source is functional and operational for throughout the year as suggested by the earlier studies jakariya et al 2007 thakur and gupta 2016 the study area is shown in fig 1 arsenic and iron field test kits were used to check the concentration levels of as and iron in drinking water field test kits manufactured by prerana laboratories pune were used the company is accredited by the world health organisation who and the bureau of indian standards bis water samples were collected during february may 2013 and february may 2019 as discussed in an earlier paper the results of the water samples were based on the strips of the colour used in the field test kit thakur and gupta 2016 van geen et al 2016 and the magnitude of as concentration was identified based on change in the colour of the strip van geen et al 2016 annaduzzaman et al 2018 the following procedures adopted during the time of testing the water samples no change in the colour indicates 0 μg l of as concentration a slight change in colour yellow patch indicates 10 μg l of as light yellow indicates 50 μg l of as deep yellow indicates 100 μg l of as light orange indicates 300 μg l in the samples and dark orange indicates 500 μg l of as concentration in the water finally the colour of the strip and the as concentration were noted as per the colour chart van geen et al 2014 thakur and gupta 2016 annaduzzaman et al 2018 if there was no change in the colour it indicated absence of detectable iron concentration slight pink indicated 100 μg l pink indicated concentration of 300 μg l light dark indicated 500 μg l and dark black indicated more than 1000 μg l around 5 of the water samples were sent to the laboratory to see the change in the result of water sample tested through field test kit and atomic absorption spectroscopy aas methods as suggested by the earlier studies saha et al 2019 in the study the relationship between the depth of the tube well and the as concentration level is examined in earlier scientific hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical studies it was suggested that as concentration is mainly found in the depth of 12 55 m mowr 2010 b van geen et al 2016 the respondents were asked about the depth of the tube well the depth of the tube well in the study area was in the range of 14 76 m depth 2 3 household survey the primary data was collected through a household survey based semi structured questionnaire from february to may 2019 the questionnaire was divided into 2 sections which covered various aspects associated with water and iron related problems the first section aimed to collect information on households awareness of the presence of as and iron in drinking water and overall water quality problems etc the second section collates information on water source and availability of water sources and various uses of water environmental concerns include water related information such as as related issues water quality issues and awareness of water purification methods the study surveyed 388 respondents from both the blocks and found that only 28 5 of the respondents were aware of the water quality problems and their associated health and other socioeconomic issues around 31 5 of the respondents do not have any formal education surveys were also carried out to collect tube well water samples and test the as and iron concentration level information on the depth of the tube well was also collected through the survey 2 4 descriptive statistical analysis the basic summary statistics are presented in table 1 presents the summary statistics the descriptive statistical analysis such as mean range standard deviation frequency distribution and other graphs were calculated by using microsoft office excel 2016 the depth of the tube well and as concentration level is calculated using stata 13 0 and arcgis 10 was used to prepare the location map of the study area saha et al 2019 most of the households use drinking water through the tube well 3 results and discussion 3 1 geology and hydrogeology of the aquifer sediments earlier studies advocate the relationship among the geomorphology groundwater migration fluvial depositional setting and the intensity of the arsenic concentrations but could not explain the scale and basin wide component of the arsenic contamination acharyya and shah 2007 ghosh et al 2015 mukherjee et al 2012 donselaar et al 2017 it indicates the ubiquitous source of microbial respiration which causes the release of arsenic from its solid state donselaar et al 2017 the geology hydrogeology and geomorphological units in the study area are much more noticeable in the bengal basin aquifers and in the central ganges basin the groundwater chemistry described recharge provenance and fate of solutes in as affected areas mukherjee et al 2012 holocene fluvial and deltaic flood basins are the hotspots of as pollution and that the dominant geomorphological setting of the as polluted areas consists of shallow depth meandering river deposits with sand prone fluvial point bar deposits surrounded by clay filled clay plug abandoned meander bends oxbow lakes donselaar et al 2017 the groundwater chemistry in the bengal basin and the study area reflects a variety of differences in the aquifers settings in the geological and geomorphological conditions bhattacharya et al 2007 mukherjee et al 2012 along the ganges river in bihar the data of as concentrations and organic matter content reveals that the low permeable clay plug deposits have a high organic matter content and the adjacent permeable point bar sands show high but spatially very variable as concentrations donselaar et al 2017 the study area encompasses the largest fluvial system and have among the highest yielding aquifers globally mukherjee et al 2015 the lower part of the upper aquifer is more vulnerable to as mobilisation with the increasing water extraction in the river ganges basin saha et al 2011 the geology in the study area is classified as older alluvial deposits of the river ganges and its various tributaries oa active or younger alluvial deposits of the river ganges and its various tributaries ya sediments of the himalayan foothills and pre cenozoic metamorphics and volcanic mukherjee et al 2012 the older alluvium was characterised by the yellow brown clay with abundant calcareous and ferruginous concretions while the newer alluvium has calcareous concretions acharyya and shah 2007 while drilling tubewells local masons identified five different types of sediment colours black white off white buff brown and red and brown off white or red sediment layers are targeted to install tubewells instead of using white and off white sediments which was the case in the past in the study area thakur et al 2019 the east west main active channel of the ganges acts as a geological geomorphological and hydraulic divide between the pre cenozoic cratonic rocks to the south and extensive alluvial deposits to the north mukherjee et al 2012 the main features that were mapped included the river channels older and active alluvial flood plains older and active interfluve plains bedrock outcrops and piedmont deposits mukherjee et al 2012 3 2 depth of tubewell and arsenic levels respondent was asked about the depth of their tubewells to understand the relationship between depths and its associated as and iron contamination levels the depth of the tube well used for drinking water is in the range of 14 76 m the mean depth of the tube well in the study area found to be 32 m the concentration of as contamination is mainly found in the range of 14 49 m in depth in the deep tubewells 49 m depth the as concentration was 10 μg l which is safe for drinking water as prescribed by who and bis an inverse association is found between depth of tubewells and the concentration of as i e higher the depth lesser is the contamination fig 2 a c depicts the detailed analysis of the depth of tubewells and the associated concentration of as in drinking water in shallow and deep tubewells there is a paucity of studies that establish the relationship between depths of tube well and the associated levels of as contamination in drinking water in households private tubewells although a few studies assess the relationship in public wells mowr 2015 van geen et al 2016 although there are almost no data on as levels in irrigation waters these tubewells are for the most part in shallow aquifers 20 70 m that generally have the highest levels of as nickson et al 2000 the results from the field study found that as contamination is mainly found between 14 and 49 m depth fig 2a and b and in deep tubewells 49 m and deeper fig 2c the as concentration levels were less than 50 μg l the findings of the present study support the earlier studies that as is mainly found at the depth of 12 46 m mowr 2010b van geen et al 2014 van geen et al 2016 since the depth of the tube well in the study area is in the range of 14 76 m and among those wells most of them are shallow tube well 49 m both the short and long run health impacts are undeniable 3 3 arsenic concentration in water samples to know the levels of concentration of as contamination water samples were collected and tested from the study area fig 1 the mean concentration of as contamination was found to be 91 36 μg l which is higher than the prescribed standard limit of who and bis of 10 μg l and 50 μg l respectively it appears from the result of water sample analysis that 39 04 of water samples contained as at concentrations 10 μg l 18 1 samples contained concentrations between 11 and 50 μg l 20 8 samples contained in the range of 51 to 100 μg l 15 8 samples contained between 101 and 300 μg l and 5 of the samples had as concentrations between 301 and 500 μg l for the entire study area fig 3 and fig 4 from the analysis of water samples of the maner block it was found that 24 2 of the water samples contained as 10 μg l 19 03 samples contained 11 to 50 μg l 30 7 samples had as in the range of 51 to 100 μg l 19 03 contained as between 101 and 300 μg l and 6 8 of the water samples contained the metal in the range of 301 to 500 μg l fig 3 water sample analysis of kitta chauhattar gps from maner blocks reveals that 29 6 of water samples contained as 10 μg l 16 3 samples contained 11 to 50 μg l 33 7 water samples had as in the range of 51 to 100 μg l 12 5 contained as between 101 and 300 μg l and 7 7 of the water samples contained concentrations in the range of 301 to 500 μg l fig 3 the water sample test of haldi chhapra and rampur diara villages from maner blocks reveals that 18 7 of samples contained as 10 μg l 22 3 samples contained 11 to 50 μg l 27 2 of samples contained as between 51 and 100 μg l 26 7 water samples had as in the range of 51 to 100 μg l and 5 8 of the water samples contained as between 301 and 500 μg l fig 3 the results of the water sample test from the laboratory revealed a similar result where concentration 50 μg l in drinking water where the concentration levels of as in drinking water exceed the 50 μg l level the average contamination was 112 8 μg l in the dudhaila village from maner and dudhghat from shahpur the average contamination level was higher than the other surveyed areas fig 3 presents the analysis of as in water samples from the tube well from kitta chauhattar and haldi chhapra from maner block the water sample analysis revealed that the as concentrations are higher in the gps of maner than in the gps of shahpur from the analysis of water samples of the shahpur block it was found that 55 4 contained as 10 μg l 17 2 contained 11 to 50 μg l 9 7 had as in the range of 51 to 100 μg l 14 5 contained as between 101 and 300 μg l and 2 9 contained the metal in the range of 301 to 500 μg l fig 4 the presence of as in semariya palti ojha gps of shahpur block was more severe than the barsaun gps of the same block the first case of as detection was reported from the semariya palti ojha gps of shahpur block in 2002 chakraborti et al 2003 mowr 2010b water sample analysis of semariya palti ojha gps from shahpur blocks reveals that 43 6 of water samples contained as 10 μg l 13 4 contained 11 to 50 μg l 14 6 had as in the range of 51 to 100 μg l 23 contained as between 101 and 300 μg l and 5 1 contained concentration in the range of 301 to 500 μg l fig 4 while the water sample test of barsaun gps from maner blocks reveals that 71 4 contained as 10 μg l 22 2 contained 11 to 50 μg l 3 1 contained as between 51 and 100 μg l and 3 1 contained as between 101 and 300 μg l and no as concentration found in the range of 301 to 500 μg l fig 4 fig 4 presents the analysis of as in water samples from the tube well from semariya palti ojha and barsaun gps from shahpur block 3 4 iron in water samples the concentration levels of iron from 935 tube well were tested by using a field test kit the water sample analysis of iron in both the blocks revealed that the contamination level of iron in drinking water was similar from the water sample analysis it was found that 74 7 74 15 and 74 44 contained iron higher than the prescribed level of bis from maner shahpur and the study area respectively kitta chauhattar and haldi chhapra water samples from maner block revealed that 78 89 and 69 64 contained more iron than the recommended level for safe drinking water the water samples analysis of semariya palti ojha and barsaun gps from shahpur revealed that 75 79 and 71 96 contained more iron than the bis standard it was found that only 25 56 of samples from the study area are found to be less than the safe level of drinking water fig 5 presents the analysis of iron in water samples from hand pump tubewells from maner shahpur and the study area 3 5 health issues the health problems due to as in drinking water have been classified by who 2011 into primary secondary and tertiary diseases the researcher discussed with the medical team to understand different diseases prevailing due to as in drinking water the majority of the health problems is primary 55 secondary 43 and only around 2 were of tertiary primary health issues are black spots on the body 44 redness of conjunctiva 1 and white black spots on the body 29 non pitting edema 28 is major secondary health issues previous studies suggested that as concentration levels in drinking water over 50 μg l bis standard are likely to cause various skin diseases such as arsenicosis arsenical dermatosis skin lesions keratosis and hyperkeratosis chakraborti et al 2017 haque et al 2003 guha mazumdar 2008 kapaj et al 2006 and if the concentration levels in drinking water continue with more than 300 μg l for a few years it can lead to gangrene and various forms of cancer such as bladder cancer lung cancer and intestine cancer etc bates et al 2004 marshall et al 2007 steinmaus et al 2003 the results from the household survey found that poor households are suffering more due to as induced health problems than the well off households households whose source of drinking water have 300 μg l of as suffers more health issues than those households where concentration level is 50 μg l children are more exposed and susceptible to the adverse effects of as and toxic metals than the adults it is found that in maner 75 3 87 cases of male 79 4 08 female and 46 2 37 children suffer from skin lesions in shahpur 31 2 19 cases of male 41 2 90 female and 43 3 04 children are suffering from skin lesions in the dudhghat village of semariya palti ojha gps and dudhaila rampur diara and haldi chapda villages from kitta chauhattar and haldi chapra gps a group of children are drinking highly contaminated water and are facing skin lesion problems black spots and black and white spot problems among the children on their entire bodies were found study finds children with a skin lesion due to highly contaminated water opposite to earlier studies which suggests children are less exposed to melanosis spotted melanosis keratosis and spotted keratosis rahman et al 2005 chakraborty et al 2016 from the field survey we found that skin and liver problems are more among children chakraborti et al 2003 found that children below the age of 12 years are less prone to as skin lesions in bangladesh and west bengal india the study further suggests exceptions can be there where as concentration is more than 1000 μg l in drinking water and where normally children suffer from malnutrition problem rahman et al 2005 chakraborti et al 2013 2016 although the earlier study suggested that children are less vulnerable to melanosis spotted melanosis keratosis and spotted keratosis rahman et al 2005 chakraborti et al 2013 2017 3 6 awareness we surveyed 388 respondents and their responses to water quality presence of as and iron through a questionnaire and testing of water quality the findings revealed that only 28 5 of the respondents are aware of the presence of as in the drinking water and its associated health impacts around 48 of the respondents were aware of the presence of iron in drinking water but did not know the associated health impacts the literature suggests awareness is helpful to frame policies in disease prone areas nicksic et al 2016 the sustainability of as mitigation singh et al 2018 and exposed threats solely depend on various socioeconomic and demographic conditions scata et al 2016 madajewicz et al 2007 suggested information can reduce household behaviour to avoid the risk it was suggested that with the information about safe well the probability of changing the unsafe well within a year to be 0 37 the study also provides an important dimension in education increases the information probability among the respondents and 10 years of more schooling lead to increase the probability of information from 0 39 to 0 43 for women and 0 08 to 0 32 for men madajewicz et al 2007 the knowledge about as and awareness are useful in as mitigation among those communities with a higher perceived risk of health and economic conditions singh and taylor 2019 it was found that only 13 92 of respondents have taken any defensive measures to remove contamination from their water source the reasons for not taking any defensive activities are multifold such as lack of awareness about defensive activities lack of available appropriate sources and lack of government initiative on providing drinking water households need to be aware of using drinking water from deep hand pump tubewells which are as free 4 conclusions the groundwater contamination problem such as as and iron in india and particularly in bihar is increasing with every year this leads to a serious health problem for the inhabitants who reside in the as contaminated areas in the state of bihar in the present study households drinking water samples were tested for 935 tubes well the results of the water samples revealed that more than 44 of the sample households drinking water sources are having as more than 50 μg l the as concentration in kitta chauhattar and haldi chhapra was more severe than in semariya palti ojha and barsaun around 74 44 of the samples contained iron above the bis levels of safe drinking water the results of the water test in the study area support the results of the previous studies the results of the study found that the households are not aware of the as in drinking water and its associated health problems from the survey it was revealed that 48 of the respondents were aware of the presence of iron in drinking water and its associated problems but only 28 5 of the respondents were aware of the presence of as in drinking water and its associated social economic environmental and health impacts george et al 2012 suggested in their study in bangladesh that household level awareness and education significantly increase the as awareness among households in bangladesh the government of bihar must initiate such awareness and education programmes in the affected areas with as concentration this will further help to achieve as awareness sustainably finally some of the shortcomings of the study are discussed to improve the study for further research the study can be further extended to use the identification of safe as iron manganese and other heavy metals based on colour based sediment testing in the as affected areas of bihar in the tune of bangladesh for sustainable mitigation on the community level the study captured the depth of the tubewells while collecting the water samples of as and iron for testing through the field test kit since the temporal variability is present in the as concentration it could be a limitation of the study the study used field test kits for testing both iron and as water samples and the concentration level is approximately in the range and not the exact level this could be another limitation the findings of the study will help to provide and formulate the recommendation and to identify the options for safe sources of drinking water in the study area and other regions of the state the present research may be improved further by future researchers on these limitations to

12017,contamination of groundwater resources from nitrates is a worldwide problem and jordan is not an exception source identification of contamination is a prerequisite for the protection of water resources and human health moreover investigating the controlling processes of groundwater quality is essential for groundwater sustainability especially in water poor countries like jordan environmental isotopes of nitrate 15n and 18o of no3 have been applied for the first time in jordan to assess the origin and cycling of nitrogen pollution in two phreatic aquifer systems shallala aquifer b5 b4 and amman wadi sir aquifer b2 a7 hosted in multiple land use area in northern jordan the nitrate concentration exceeded the natural background 5 10 mg l in all samples ranging from 14 to 251 mg l as no3 in both groundwater systems about 46 of the samples showed no3 concentration exceeding the who threshold of 50 mg l in drinking water isotope values of nitrate 15n and 18o of no3 indicated that manure urban wastewaters and nitrified synthetic fertilizers were the main sources of nitrate in the groundwater resources in the study area siar stable isotope analysis in r model showed that synthetic fertilizers contributed least to nitrate in groundwater in the study area average 3 3 nitrified synthetic fertilizers contribution was higher in the b2 a7 aquifer 61 than in b5 b4 aquifer 49 whereas anthropogenic organic matter contribution in the b5 b4 46 is higher than in the b2 a7 aquifer 36 anthropogenic organic matter contribution in the b5 b4 aquifer varied from 20 in the west to 85 in east nitrified synthetic fertilizers contribution varied from 10 in the east to 74 in the west sustainable management of groundwater resources in the study area necessitates

introduction nitrate no3 is the most common human induced pollutant in groundwater resources spalding and exner 1993 babiker et al 2004 nitrate is a highly mobile ion with low affinity for adsorption allowing it to enter groundwater easily panno et al 2006 indicated that areas that are unaffected by human activities typically have natural background concentrations of nitrate that do not exceed 5 10 mg l as no3 however nitrate concentrations hereafter expressed as no3 in surface water and groundwater can reach high levels as a result of agricultural activities utilizing n containing

al 2013a 2013b multivariate techniques enable one to handle and reduce large number of data as well as identify and classify factors controlling water quality by analyzing similarities dissimilarities among the sampled sites zhu et al 2019 matiatos 2016 prasanna et al 2010 andrade et al 2008 water resources in jordan are currently experiencing quality problems and many groundwater systems are contaminated due to nitrogen pollution the jordanian standards for drinking water quality set a maximum permissible nitrate concentration of 50 mg l and 70 mg l if no better sources are available jsmo 2001 previous works have revealed that no3 concentrations exceed the maximum permissible level of 50 mg l set by international organizations and national authorities e g obeidat et al 2008 obeidat et al 2013a 2013b awawdeh et al 2015 a drastic vulnerability map indicated that about 31 of the yarmouk river basin is having moderate vulnerability which may be attributed to agricultural activities in the area awawdeh and jaradat 2010 another study used epik model awawdeh and nawafleh 2008 showed that most of irbid governorate is having moderate to high pollution susceptibility where many wells with high nitrate contamination are found within regions of moderate pollution potential the authors attributed this to the intensive agricultural activities and wastewater contamination however the use of nitrogen isotopes in the assessment of nitrogen pollution in water systems in the country is very limited e g grimmeisen et al 2017 the overall objective of this study was to assess groundwater origin and water quality related to nitrate in two unconfined aquifer systems shallala rijam aquifer b5 b4 and amman wadi sir aquifer b2 a7 in northern jordan using isotopic conventional hydrochemical and statistical techniques nitrogen isotopes were particularly used to identify the origin and cycling of nitrogen pollution and to estimate the relative contributions of the main nitrate sources by using a bayesian isotope mixing model siar land use land cover analysis was also carried out to better understand sources of contamination which can be integrated with the hydrogeological situation in the application of best management practices this study aims to highlight the need to protect groundwater systems from pollution in jordan by providing information about the nitrate sources and processes that contribute to the degradation of water quality the results from this study shall be an essential guidance for competent authorities to enforce and activate environmental measures and policies to protect groundwater resources in the study area 2 study area 2 1 location and climate the study area is located in northern jordan and covers the northernmost of the jordanian part of

380 m with a yield in the range of 20 70 m3 h however the regional depth to groundwater table is in the range of 250 500 m below ground surface 2 3 land use land cover the study area is characterized by mixed land usages fig 2b most of the area is used for agricultural purposes 56 7 intensively cultivated in places whereas the rest is classified mostly as rangeland 12 7 and urban 11 8 potential nitrogen pollution hazards to groundwater in the study area include olive presses animal husbandry landfills wastewater treatment plants cultivated areas with frequent use of fertilizers and urban effluents due to the lack of central sewage network a wide variation of synthetic fertilizers is used in the cultivation of wheat fruits and vegetables such as urea dap and ammonium sulfate depending on crop type and growth stages 3 materials and methods 3 1 sample collection and analysis twenty four samples were collected from the b5 b4 aquifer 20 springs and 4 wells and 6 samples were collected from wells tapping the b2 a7 in the southernmost of the study area fig 2b the sampling campaigns were conducted in the rainy season january and february 2018 all water samples were field filtered through 0 45 μm millipore filters into hdpe sample bottles with appropriate storage and preservation methods refrigeration freezing acidification addition of chloroform the methods described by apha 1998 were followed during field work and laboratory chemical analyses electrical conductivity ec temperature and ph were measured in situ using portable meters prior to sample collection from the wells intensive purging was performed in order to ensure representativeness and reproducibility of the groundwater sample chemical analyses were carried out at the laboratories of jordan university of science and technology and yarmouk university calcium ca 2 magnesium mg 2 sodium na potassium k chloride cl and sulfate so4 2 concentrations were determined by ion chromatography dionex ics 1600 bicarbonate hco3 and nitrate no3 were determined by titration method and spectrophotometry respectively total hardness th was calculated using calcium and magnesium concentrations todd 1980 existing chemical analysis data for the wastewaters influent and effluent from ramtha wastewater treatment plant rwwtp as well as isotopic data of precipitation in jordan were obtained from the water authority of jordan waj the 15n 14n and 18o 16o ratios of the no3 in the water samples were determined at the environmental isotope laboratory university of waterloo canada using n2o chemical denitrifier gvi tracegas isoprime no3 is converted to no2 using a cadmium catalyst then chemically converted to n2o which is then analyzed on a trace gas gvi isoprime irms tg irms the method described by mcilvin and altabet 2005 was applied for quality assurance quality control qa qc purposes each sample was prepared in duplicate and 2 extractions from each preparation were run minimum 10 repeated in duplicate repeat if not within specification if still not within specification trouble shoot with standard three calibrated standards usgs 34 usgs 35 and in house egc 17 were used for normalization also included in each batch are three check standards at the start middle and end two are in house egc 1 and a single iaea no3 during a sample run linearity checks were included using a suite of 100 ppm n2o in helium of known isotopic composition to produce a range of peak heights that encompass the expected sample peaks range the analytical precision of the laboratory analysis was 0 3 and 0 8 for 15n and 18o respectively the 2h 1h and 18o 16o ratios of the water samples were measured using a los gatos research lgr liquid water isotope analyzer model t lwia 45 ep with an analytical precision of 0 2 and 0 8 for 18o and 2h respectively the method can be summarized as follows approximately 1000 nl of water was injected into the heated septum port by a leap technology ctc pal liquid auto sampler upon injection the water rapidly vaporized and was expanded into the laser cell of the lwia each sample was injected 8 times the first 2 were discarded as conditioning and the remaining 6 averaged for reporting unlike mass spectrometry techniques the h2o molecules were not converted to other gases but rather were measured directly by off axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy icos laser system all samples were pre filtered to 0 45 μm the stable isotope ratios were expressed in delta δ units and a per mil notation relative to an international standard δ sample 0 r sample r s tan d a r d r s tan d a r d 1000 w h e r e r sample and r standard are the 15n 14n 2h 1h or 18o 16o ratios of the sample and international reference standard respectively values of δ 15n were reported relative to n2

simplify and organize large data sets in a way to provide meaningful insight in the relationships between the variables laaksoharju et al 1999 k mean cluster analysis is a non hierarchical technique that helps identifying patterns by grouping similar objects into groups called clusters the observations or objects within each cluster are similar but the clusters are dissimilar to each other rencher 2002 principal component analysis pca or factor analysis is widely used for data reduction in hydrochemical and hydrogeological studies farnham et al 2003 matiatos et al 2014 tanasković et al 2012 data reduction is derived from linear combinations of the original variables leading to a new set of variables classified in such a way that the first principal components or factors are responsible for most of the variation in all of the original variables bošnjak et al 2012 everitt and hothorn 2011 a dataset of physical chemical parameters from b5 b4 aquifer was used for k mean cluster analysis and pca implementation the analysis was not carried out for the physical chemical parameters from b2 a7 because of the limited dataset the dataset consisted of 24 samples and comprised 11 parameters i e ph ec tds ca mg na k hco3 cl so4 and no3 k mean cluster analysis was used to classify the samples with similar hydrochemical characteristics in relatively homogeneous groups and to identify differences between the groups pca aimed at identifying the main geochemical processes governing the hydrochemistry of the groundwater in the region the number of principal components kept was based on the kaiser criterion for which only the components with eigenvalues greater than 1 were retained kaiser 1958 in addition in order to maximize the variance of the principal axes the varimax normalized rotation was applied multivariate statistical analysis performed in the present study has been supported by the software package spss release 13 3 3 bayesian isotopic mixing model the relative contributions of nitrate sources were estimated by using a bayesian isotope mixing model in the software package stable isotope analysis in r a language and environment for statistical computing parnell et al 2010 xue et al 2012 the siar model was run for three predefined sources of nitrate synthetic no3 fertilizers nitrified synthetic fertilizers such nh4 fertilizers and anthropogenic organic matter for both aquifers the isotopic values of three sources were taken from literature e g kendall 1998 the lowest values of δ 15n no3 are typically related to inorganic fertilizers whereas the highest ones are related to manure or sewage wastes values of δ15n no3 from different sources reported in the literature can be summarized as follows atmospheric nitrate deposition has values in the range of 13 to 13 manure and sewage in the range of 4 to 25 chemical fertilizers in the range of 6 to 6 and soil nitrogen in the range of 3 to 9 xue et al 2009 kendall et al 2007 on the other hand δ 18o no3 values are in the range of 10 to 10 for nitrification of soil nitrogen nh4 in fertilizers and manure and sewage 17 to 25 for nitrate fertilizers and 25 to 75 for nitrate in precipitation fang et al 2012 xue et al 2009 zhang et al 2018a b for a set of n mixture measurements on j isotopes with k source contributors the mixing model can be expressed as follows parnell et al 2010 x i j k 1 k p k s j k c j k ε i j s j k n μ j k ω j k 2 c j k n λ j k τ j k 2 ε i j n 0 σ j 2 where x ij is the isotope value j of the mixture i in which i 1 2 3 n and j 1 2 3 j s jk is the source value k on isotope j k 1 2 3 k and is normally distributed with mean μ jk and standard deviation ω jk p k is the proportion of source k which needs to be estimated by the siar model c jk is the isotope fractionation factor for isotope j on source k and is normally distributed with mean λ jk and standard deviation τ jk and ε ij is the residual error representing the additional unquantified variation between individual mixtures and is normally distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation σ j a detailed description of this model can be found in moore and semmens 2008 jackson et al 2009 and parnell et al 2010 4 results and discussion 4 1 groundwater chemistry most of the hydrochemical parameters of the b5 b4 aquifer showed high geochemical variability compared to those of the b2 a7 as indicated by the coefficient of variance which is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean value table 1 the high variability of the ionic concentrations of the b5 b4 aquifer suggests multiple sources and or hydrogeochemical and mixing processes controlling the spatial distribution of the groundwater quality masoud 2014 the ec values for b5 b4 aquifer ranged between 322 and 1973 μs cm with an average of 744 μs cm whereas for b2 a7 aquifer the ec values were between 445 and 570 μs cm with an average of 514 μs cm fig 4 a based on davis and dewiest classification 1967 the groundwater of both aquifers can be considered freshwater tds 1000 mg l except for the samples 12 and 13 of the b5 b4 aquifer which were classified as brackish waters tds 1000 mg l these samples were collected from two wells located in the vicinity of ramtha wastewater treatment plant rwwtp based on sawyer and mccarty classification 1968 the groundwater of b5 b4 and b2 a7 aquifers can be considered as hard very hard and hard water respectively calcium and sodium are the dominant cations in the groundwater of b5 b4 aquifer constituting 62 and 20 of the total cations in meq l respectively bicarbonate and chloride are the dominant anions counting for 44 and 29 of the total anions in meq l respectively plotting the groundwater samples from the two aquifers in a piper diagram diamond shape revealed that the b5 b4 aquifer is primarily a ca mg cl water type 55 followed by a ca mg hco3 type 41 and a na cl water type 4 fig 5 a the ca mg hco3 type refers to the groundwater samples influenced by the dissolution of carbonate formations such as limestones and dolomites this type of water represents freshwater that is not affected by human activities and recently infiltrated el yaaouti et al 2009 the ca mg cl water type is indicative of cation exchange processes due to mixing with more saline waters such as those showing a na cl water type the samples collected from the b2 a7 aquifer were plotted in the ca mg hco3 type in the diamond shape indicating carbonate dissolution of ca mg bearing minerals nitrate concentration in groundwater samples of b5 b4 aquifer ranged from 14 to 251 mg l with an average of 79 mg l whereas for b2 a7 aquifer nitrate varied between 19 and 61 mg l with an average of 38 mg l fig 4b the maximum nitrate concentration was reported for the groundwater sample 13 of b5 b4 aquifer located in the vicinity of the rwwtp other potential sources of contamination include agricultural synthetic fertilizers animal husbandry and septic tanks in general the highest values of no3 and ec in the b5 b4 aquifer were found in the eastern ramtha area and northwestern parts of the aquifer where cesspools are used for sanitation purposes obeidat et al 2008 obeidat et al 2013a 2013b found that the depth to groundwater hydraulic conductivity and lineaments density were the main factors that control the b5 b4 vulnerability to contamination in ramtha area about 66 of the samples from the b2 a7 aquifer showed no3 concentrations higher than the natural background indicating the influence of nitrogen pollution originating from human activities the most important influential factors that dictate the aquifer vulnerability to contamination in the study area include depth to water table soil cover rock types and recharge rate margane et al 1999 ramtha east part b5 b4 aquifer um qais west part b5 b4 aquifer and nuaimeh areas b2 a7 aquifer were classified as having extremely high vulnerability to pollution this was attributed to shallow water table and low protective cover above the saturated zone awawdeh et al 2015 found that the area surrounding rwwtp was the most vulnerable to contamination because of shallow groundwater table low slope high lineaments density and high hydraulic conductivity the high correlation between ec and ca mg na cl and so4 was attributed to groundwater salinity originating from water rock interaction and or pollution from anthropogenic activities table 2 the significant correlation r 0 99 between na and cl indicates a common source of salinity such as mixing with brackish water or dissolution of evaporites the correlation of no3 with k and so4 suggested an agricultural source of pollution synthetic fertilizers and the moderate correlation with cl showed the contamination from a wastewater source the no3 cl ratio was used to primarily discriminate the nitrate pollution sources anornu et al 2107 the value of 0 05 0 22 given by ma et al 2009 and li et al 2017 was adopted as a reference value of no3 cl ratio not affected by human activities anornu et al 2017 according to liu et al 2006 high cl values against low no3 cl ratio reflect effluents and organic wastes however high no3 cl ratio against low cl values reflect agricultural sources and low no3 cl ratio against low cl values reflect denitrification and uptake of no3 by plants the no3 cl ratio for groundwater of b5 b4 aquifer ranged between 0 15 and 3 7 with an average of 1 04 and from 0 7 to 1 3 with an average of 0 93 for the aquifer b2 a7 these values indicated human induced source of no3 in the groundwater resources 4 2 multivariate statistical analysis 4 2 1 k mean cluster analysis the results of the analysis revealed four clusters table s1 cluster 1 represented 22 7 of the samples and the water of this group was mainly classified as of ca mg hco3 water type with the lowest dissolved ions content fig 5b the nitrate concentration was below or slightly higher than the natural background concentration so the water of this group can be considered slightly affected by human activities and water chemistry of this group can be considered as the natural background of the groundwater clusters 2 and 4 included 45 5 and 22 7 of the samples respectively and both clusters showed a ca mg cl water type the two clusters had nitrate cluster centers higher than the maximum who permissible limit 51 mg l for cluster 2 and 153 mg l for cluster 4 cluster 3 contained the samples 12 and 13 from the eastern part of the aquifer ramtha area showing the highest ionic concentrations among the four clusters and its water was classified as na cl or brackish in addition the nitrate concentration was much higher than the who permissible limit 177 7 mg l plotting the four clusters and wastewater in a compositional diagram fig s1 revealed that wastewater was a major source of pollution in the eastern part of the aquifer cluster 2 fell along the mixing line between cluster 1 and cluster 4 indicating a mixture of waters from the two clusters the relationship between no3 cl ratio and cl concentration of the four clusters fig 6 showed that cluster 3 has high cl concentration and low no3 cl ratio indicating a manure septic source of nitrate cluster 4 showed a high no3 cl ratio and relatively low cl concentration reflecting an agricultural fertilizers source of nitrate cluster 1 showed low concentrations of nitrate and chloride close or slightly higher than the natural background indicating limited nitrogen pollution 4 2 2 principal component analysis the results of pca for hydrochemical parameters of the b5 b4 table 3 revealed that the contribution of the first three factors factor 1 factor 2 and factor 3 is 66 0 13 3 and 12 6 respectively accounting for approximately 92 0 of the total variance the loadings for the varimatrix rotated factor matrix in the three factors model are shown in table 3 factor 1 showed strong positive loadings of ec tds cl so4 na and mg and moderate positive loading of no3 this factor was termed the salinity factor due to water rock interactions evaporation processes and anthropogenic impact other researches indicated that infiltration of domestic wastewater often leads to increase in major ions concentrations such as cl na k ca no3 and tds e g zhu et al 2019 wang et al 2017 kim et al 2009 the moderate positive loading of nitrate indicated a common source of groundwater salinization and nitrogen pollution natural sources of groundwater salinity include mixing of fresh groundwater with paleo seawater water rock interaction saline surface water and marine aerosols kloppmann et al 2014 re and zuppi 2011 anthropogenic sources include salt water intrusion due to over pumping industrial activities domestic solid and liquid waste disposal mining and agricultural activities appelo and postma 2005 qin et al 2013 han et al 2015 liu et al 2019 re and sacchi 2017 the association of no3 and so4 indicates anthropogenic influence on the water quality through synthetic fertilizers and domestic wastewater el yaaouti et al 2009 qin et al 2013 das and nag 2017 aravinthasamy et al 2019 the highest scores for factor 1 are mainly found in the area surrounding rwwtp in the easternmost part of the aquifer fig s2 a study carried out by obeidat et al 2013a 2013b indicated that rwwtp was the main pollution source of nitrate in b5 b4 aquifer beneath the plant factor 2 accounted for about 13 3 of the total variance exhibiting strong positive association with ca and hco3 and strong negative association with ph this correlation could likely be attributed to the dissolution of the hosting rocks e g limestone indicating a water rock interaction factor the high negative loading of ph reflects the influence of acid base conditions on groundwater chemistry dragon 2008 the weak positive loading of mg indicates that factor 2 is partly controlled by the dissolution of mg bearing minerals such as dolomites the spatial distribution of the factor 2 scores fig s2 showed that water rock interaction is a major process that controls b5 b4 groundwater chemistry this factor reflects the influence of mineral dissolution e g limestones in the groundwater quality the highest scores corresponded mostly to samples located in carbonate formations factor 3 accounted for 12 7 of the total variance and it showed strong positive correlation between no3 and k thus factor 3 was regarded as the nitrate contamination factor most likely due to agricultural fertilizers the highest scores of this factor were observed in the northern and southeastern parts of the b5 b4 aquifer where the depth of the groundwater table is small 40 m a s l and the cultivation is intense the association of k and no3 definitely indicates agricultural sources synthetic fertilizers of pollution singh et al 2017 4 3 stable isotopes of water the stable isotope composition of the groundwater resources in the study area was plotted in a δ 2h δ 18o diagram fig 7 together with the global meteoric water line gmwl the eastern mediterranean meteoric water line emwl and the stable isotope composition of rainfall in jordan 6 27 0 11 δ 18o 11 4 0 66 bajjali 2012 craig 1961 reported that δ18o and δ2h in fresh waters from different countries correlate on a global scale this meteoric relationship was attributed to isotopic fractionation during condensation the line defined by this relationship is known as the global meteoric water line or gmwl and it matches the following equation δ 2 h 8 δ 18 o 10 the constant 10 is called deuterium excess d and it is defined as follows d δ 2 h 8 18 o different local meteoric water lines from various parts of the world have been established the meteoric water line of the middle east or mediterranean mmwl was found to be as follows gat and carmi 1970 δ 2 h 8 δ 18 o 22 for the groundwater of the b2 a7 aquifer the δ 18o values ranged between 6 5 and 5 0 with an average of 6 1 and the δ 2h values ranged between 30 9 and 28 2 with an average of 29 8 table 4 most of the b2 a7 samples were located close to the lmwl of jordan confirming the meteoric origin of the groundwater these samples showed a deuterium excess d excess between 15 3 and 21 with an average of 18 2 the samples were plotted between the gmwl and emwl indicating that this water has been recharged from both continental and mediterranean precipitation verhagen et al 1991 kattan 2019 showed that the origin of the air masses producing rains in the region can be from different areas such as the siberian plateau the northern pole via eastern europe atlantic ocean the northern africa and the red sea bajjali 2012 showed that the cold and dry continental air masses originating from the european continent come in contact with the warm mediterranean sea water resulting in rapid evaporation and large scale convergence the low d excess values in precipitation 16 have been attributed to air masses that cross the north african continent and undergo a local orographic effect the location of the groundwater samples between the emmwl and the gmwl can be attributed to the origin of the air masses producing rainfall over the country which forms the ultimate source of groundwater in the study area from the atlantic ocean with contact with mediterranean sea and from the red sea which has no contact with the mediterranean sea kattan 2019 the samples of b2 a7 showed more negative values and far from the groundwater samples of b5 b4 aquifer indicating that the b2 a7 aquifer was recharged at higher altitudes 850 950 m a s l according to bajjali 2006 and that the interaction between the two aquifers was probably not significant moreover several samples of b2 a7 aquifer deviated from the lmwl towards more enriched values showing that those samples underwent evaporation prior to infiltration or that there was mixing with more enriched waters bajjali 2006 suggested that the groundwater in the nuaimeh area b2 a7 aquifer was a mixture of two sources direct recharge from precipitation and irrigation return flow which could explain the deviation from the lmwl the δ 18o values in groundwater of the b5 b4 aquifer ranged narrowly between 5 1 and 3 5 with an average of 4 6 and the δ 2h values ranged between 28 2 and 18 9 with an average of 22 9 the groundwater samples of the aquifer b5 b4 collected from both the eastern and western part were plotted far from the lmwl and around trend lines which correspond either to an evaporation line or a mixing line between more depleted recharge regions and isotopically more enriched return flow irrigated waters gat 1996 the influence of evaporation effect is confirmed by bajjali 2008 who found that the recharging water of the b5 b4 aquifer in the ramtha area has been subjected to evaporation prior to or during infiltration the samples from the eastern and western part accumulated at isotopically slightly different clouds with the samples from the eastern part of the aquifer showing more enriched isotopic values which was attributed to the difference in the hydrogeological setting of the two areas the topographic relief in the eastern part of the aquifer shows more gentle slopes which favors lower water infiltration velocities and increases the susceptibility to evaporation effect the western part of the aquifer which is dominated by springs shows steeper slopes and thus the water infiltration velocity is faster reducing the exposure to evaporative conditions a strong correlation r 0 94 was observed between δ 18o and cl in four samples samples 12 13 29 and 30 which was attributed to a strong evaporation effect on the isotope composition of the groundwater and to an increased chloride loading from anthropogenic sources mainly from domestic wastewaters rwwtp koh et al 2010 a single factor analysis of variance anova revealed that there is a significant difference between δ 18o values for the samples collected from the eastern and western parts of aquifer b5 b4 f calculated value 5 37 f critical value 4 01 but not a significant difference for δ 2h values between the two areas a single factor analysis of variance anova test confirmed that there is significant difference in both δ 18o f calculated value 120 14 f critical value 4 15 and δ 2h f calculated value 112 19 f critical value 4 15 values between the two aquifers b5 b4 and b2 a7 these differences were overall attributed to different water origins recharge altitudes and interactions between the two aquifers 4 4 stable isotopes of nitrate 4 4 1 b5 b4 aquifer the range of measured δ 15n no3 values in the groundwater samples of the b5 b4 aquifer was between 2 6 and 14 0 with an average 6 8 n 22 table 4 the δ 18o no3 values ranged from 2 3 to 5 9 with an average of 4 1 to primarily identify the predominant no3 sources and transformation processes in the study area a dual isotope bi plot approach δ 15n no3 vs δ 18o no3 was used based on kendall et al 2007 fig 8 a the nitrate isotope data for five samples 6 12 13 20 and 22 fell into the manure septic waste source window these samples showed δ 15n no3 values ranging between 8 6 and 14 1 which are in agreement with the values reported for no3 derived from manure 10 to 20 and domestic wastewater 7 to 15 matiatos 2016 and more specifically in the range for water dominated by sewage 4 to 19 given by xue et al 2009 the same samples exhibited δ 18o no3 values in the range of 3 5 and 5 9 which are typically below 15 reported for δ 18o no3 derived from sewage mayer et al 2002 these samples showed nitrate concentration in the range of 69 251 mg l with an average of 146 mg l the main source of nitrate in these samples is domestic wastewaters this is supported by the fact that cesspools are still used for the disposal of the household sewage especially in the western and middle parts of the aquifer moreover high e coli content has been reported for the same sampling points particularly for sites 12 and 13 eng kefah mrayan water authority of jordan personal commun additionally a wastewater treatment plant is located in the middle of the eastern part of the aquifer see table 4 for explanation of land use land cover the nitrate isotope values of samples 1 2 3 4 7 8 9 10 16 17 18 and 21 fell in the overlapping window of manure septic waste and soil samples 1 2 3 4 10 18 and 21 showed nitrate concentration higher than the who 2011 standards ranging between 52 and 216 mg l with an average of 114 mg l the main source of nitrogen pollution was considered urban cesspools samples 7 8 9 16 and 17 showed nitrate concentration 14 36 mg l closer to the natural background value of nitrate concentration in fresh groundwaters indicating that nitrogen pollution is not as significant as in the other areas five samples 5 11 14 15 and 19 were plotted in the overlapping area between the fields soil manure septic waste and nh4 in fertilizer and precipitation these samples showed nitrate values between 15 and 34 mg l which are higher than the natural background and are located in cultivated areas therefore nitrogen pollution in these samples probably originated from nitrified fertilizers e g nh4 fertilizers 4 4 2 b2 a7 aquifer the range of measured δ 15n no3 values for the b2 a7 was between 3 2 and 6 7 with an average of 5 6 n 6 the δ 18o no3 values ranged from 1 5 to 2 8 with an average of 2 2 five samples from the b2 a7 aquifer samples 23 24 25 26 and 28 fell in the overlapping window of manure septic waste and soil and one sample 27 fell in the overlapping area of soil manure septic waste and nh4 in fertilizer and precipitation fig 8a all samples showed nitrate concentration in the range of 19 61 mg l which is higher than the natural background the main land use land cover in this part of the study area is cropland and urban thus the main sources of nitrogen pollution in these samples were attributed to wastewaters samples 23 24 25 26 and 28 and nitrified fertilizers sample 27 the single factor analysis of variance anova test showed that there was no significant difference between δ 15n values for the two aquifers b5 b4 and b2 a7 indicating a common source of nitrogen however the test indicated that there was a significant difference between δ 18o values for the samples collected from the two aquifers where f calculated 20 368 is greater than f critical 4 225 and the p value 0 0001 is 0 05 it can be concluded that the two aquifers have a common source of nitrate but a different source of water different stable isotope composition as mentioned in the subsection 4 3 stable isotopes of water there is a significant difference in the water isotopes δ18o h2o and δ2h h2o for the two aquifers this difference is reflected in the oxygen isotope of nitrate δ 18o no3 since it is assumed that the theoretical δ 18o no3 produced by bacterial nitrification incorporates two oxygen atoms from the ambient groundwater and one oxygen atom form the atmospheric oxygen according to the following g equation kendall et al 2007 t h e o r e t i c a l δ 18 o n o 3 2 3 δ 18 o h 2 o 1 3 δ 18 o o 2 4 5 biogeochemical processes the theoretical δ 18o no3 produced by bacterial nitrification was calculated using δ 18o values measured for the groundwater in the study area table 4 assuming δ 18o of atmospheric o2 23 5 according the following equation kendall et al 2007 δ 18 o n o 3 2 3 δ 18 o h 2 o 1 3 δ 18 o o 2 the δ 18o values of microbially produced no3 are up to 5 higher than the calculated theoretical maximum of 10 aravena et al 1993 kendall 1998 mayer et al 2002 xue et al 2009 eight samples from b5 b4 aquifer showed δ 18o no3 values consistent with the theoretical δ 18o no3 values 3 samples showed δ 18o no3 values slightly higher that the theoretical ones and 11 samples exhibited δ 18o no3 values slightly lower than the theoretical ones overall the average δ 18o no3 4 1 value was close to the average theoretical δ 18o no3 4 8 value for nitrification all samples collected from b2 a7 aquifer showed δ 18o no3 values lower than the theoretical δ 18o no3 values indicating that other processes might be masking the nitrification process the relationship between nitrate concentration and δ 15n and δ 18o of nitrate values can also be used to assess biogeochemical processes such as denitrification affecting nitrate isotopic composition and mixing processes zhang et al 2018a b kim et al 2015 otero et al 2009 in denitrification the δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 values of nitrate increase as nitrate concentration decreases during nitrate reduction this biogeochemical process generates δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 ratios from 1 1 3 to 1 2 liu et al 2006 as illustrated in fig 8a it is not likely that significant denitrification processes occur in the groundwater bodies the fact that nitrate concentration and each of δ 15n and δ 18o values for the b5 b4 aquifer showed no clear cut correlation fig 8b and c and the high do concentration 6 1 8 8 mg l in all water samples confirmed that denitrification is either masked or unlikely to occur 4 6 siar mixing model for the b5 b4 aquifer the results showed that the lowest contribution was for the source synthetic fertilizers where it ranged from 2 to 5 with an average of 4 table 5 the contribution of the source nitrified synthetic fertilizers ranged from 10 to 74 with an average of 49 the contribution of the source anthropogenic organic matter ranged from 20 to 85 with an average of 46 the highest contribution of this source 85 was recorded for sample 12 which was collected in the vicinity of ramtha wastewater treatment plant rwwtp the highest contribution of the nitrified synthetic fertilizers was found for samples collected from the middle parts of the study area for the b2 a7 aquifer the contribution of the source synthetic fertilizers ranged from 2 to 3 with an average of 2 the contribution of the source nitrified synthetic fertilizers ranged from 52 to 79 with an average of 61 the contribution of the source anthropogenic organic matter ranged from 18 to 45 with an average of 36 results also showed that the contribution of the source nitrified synthetic fertilizers was higher for the b2 a7 aquifer whereas the contribution of the source anthropogenic organic matter was higher for the b5 b4 aquifer the siar model gives an estimation of the proportional contribution as it incorporates high uncertainty moreover the model output reflected the contribution of the different nitrate sources at a specific sampling time matiatos 2016 this study revealed that groundwater resources in the study area were contaminated where nitrate levels were far exceeding the natural background concentration modeling of the nitrate isotopes showed that nitrified synthetic fertilizers and septic manure waste are the main sources of contamination this contamination entails costly environmental and socioeconomic impacts thus and to achieve sustainability of the groundwater resources in the study area immediate measures should be undertaken to reduce pollutants inputs and to protect water resources for example best management practices to manage land and human activities to mitigate pollution of water resources are crucial in this concern these may include plant nutrients input management increasing irrigation efficiency animal feedlots management and awareness campaigns for the farmers to take their role in protecting natural resources moreover treated untreated domestic wastewater disposal management is a core necessity proper land use planning of the study area should be developed which involves locating pollution sources on those areas which have low vulnerability to contamination in this concern depth to water table thickness of the protective cover and climate should be taken into account groundwater protection zones should be demarcated around wells and springs 5 conclusions an integrated approach of hydrochemical statistical and isotopic methods was applied to assess groundwater quality of two unconfined aquifers in northern jordan the hydrochemistry of the b5 b4 aquifer showed high spatial variation reflecting different factors processes controlling its groundwater quality k means cluster analysis classified the groundwater samples of b5 b4 aquifer in four clusters where cluster 1 represented less nitrate polluted groundwaters whereas clusters 2 3 and 4 showed the highest nitrate concentrations originating from different sources as evidenced by the difference in the no3 cl ratios the pca resulted in a three factor model which explained approximately 92 of the total variance of the dataset and enabled the identification of the hydrogeological processes controlling the groundwater quality of b5 b4 aquifer and the evolution of the water chemistry from ca mg hco3 to na cl based on the water isotope results δ 2h and δ 18o the eastern part of the b5 b4 is characterized by stronger evaporation effect compared to the western and middle parts of the aquifer nitrogen isotope values showed that wastewater manure and nitrified synthetic fertilizers are the dominant sources of nitrate in the b5 b4 and b2 a7 aquifers the average contributions of these sources in the b5 b4 were 46 and 49 whereas their contribution in the b2 a7 were 36 and 61 respectively statistical analysis showed that the two aquifers have a common source of nitrate but different recharge areas this study highlighted the use of environmental isotopes combined with multivariate statistical analysis in locating sources of nitrate contamination in groundwater leading to a more effective planning of environmental measures to protect groundwater from pollution such as better agricultural e g fertilization manure application and storage of animal manures and sanitation practices e g better design of pit latrines and septic tanks sewer leakage

simplify and organize large data sets in a way to provide meaningful insight in the relationships between the variables laaksoharju et al 1999 k mean cluster analysis is a non hierarchical technique that helps identifying patterns by grouping similar objects into groups called clusters the observations or objects within each cluster are similar but the clusters are dissimilar to each other rencher 2002 principal component analysis pca or factor analysis is widely used for data reduction in hydrochemical and hydrogeological studies farnham et al 2003 matiatos et al 2014 tanasković et al 2012 data reduction is derived from linear combinations of the original variables leading to a new set of variables classified in such a way that the first principal components or factors are responsible for most of the variation in all of the original variables bošnjak et al 2012 everitt and hothorn 2011 a dataset of physical chemical parameters from b5 b4 aquifer was used for k mean

comprised 11 parameters i e ph ec tds ca mg na k hco3 cl so4 and no3 k mean cluster analysis was used to classify the samples with similar hydrochemical characteristics in relatively homogeneous groups and to identify differences between the groups pca aimed at identifying the main geochemical processes governing the hydrochemistry of the groundwater in the region the number of principal components kept was based on the kaiser criterion for which only the components with eigenvalues greater than 1 were retained kaiser 1958 in addition in order to maximize the variance of the principal axes the varimax normalized rotation was applied multivariate statistical analysis performed in the present study has been supported by the software package spss release 13 3 3 bayesian isotopic

statistical computing parnell et al 2010 xue et al 2012 the siar model was run for three predefined sources of nitrate synthetic no3 fertilizers nitrified synthetic fertilizers such nh4 fertilizers and anthropogenic organic matter for both aquifers the isotopic values of three sources were taken from literature e g kendall 1998 the lowest values of δ 15n no3 are typically related to inorganic fertilizers whereas the highest ones are related to manure or sewage wastes values of δ15n no3 from different sources reported in the literature can be summarized as follows atmospheric nitrate deposition has values in the range of 13 to 13 manure and sewage in the range of 4 to 25 chemical fertilizers in the range of 6 to 6 and soil nitrogen in the range of 3 to 9 xue et al 2009 kendall et

nitrate in precipitation fang et al 2012 xue et al 2009 zhang et al 2018a b for a set of n mixture measurements on j isotopes with k source contributors the mixing model can be expressed as follows parnell et al 2010 x i j k 1 k p k s j k c j k ε i j s j k n μ j k ω j k 2 c j k n λ j k τ j k 2 ε i j n 0 σ j 2 where x ij is the isotope value j of the mixture i in which i 1 2 3 n and j 1 2 3 j s jk is the source value k on isotope j k 1 2 3 k and is normally distributed with mean μ jk and standard deviation ω jk p k is the proportion of source k which needs to be estimated by the siar model c jk is the isotope fractionation factor for isotope j on source k and is normally distributed with mean λ jk and standard deviation τ jk and ε ij is the residual error representing the additional unquantified variation between individual mixtures and is normally distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation σ j a detailed description of this model can be found in moore and semmens 2008 jackson et al 2009 and parnell et al 2010 4 results and discussion 4 1 groundwater chemistry most of the hydrochemical parameters of the b5 b4 aquifer showed high geochemical variability compared to those of the b2 a7 as indicated by the coefficient of variance which is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean value table 1 the high variability of the ionic concentrations of the b5 b4 aquifer suggests multiple sources and or hydrogeochemical and mixing processes controlling the spatial distribution of the groundwater quality masoud 2014 the ec values for b5 b4 aquifer ranged between 322 and 1973 μs cm with an average of 744 μs cm whereas for b2 a7 aquifer the ec values were between 445 and 570 μs cm with an average of 514 μs cm fig 4 a based on davis and dewiest classification 1967 the groundwater of both aquifers can be considered freshwater tds 1000 mg l except for the samples 12 and 13 of the b5 b4 aquifer which were classified as brackish waters tds 1000 mg l these samples were collected from two wells located in the vicinity of ramtha wastewater treatment plant rwwtp based on sawyer and mccarty classification 1968 the groundwater of b5 b4 and b2 a7 aquifers can be considered as hard very hard and hard water respectively calcium and sodium are the dominant cations in the groundwater of b5 b4 aquifer constituting 62 and 20 of the total cations in meq l respectively bicarbonate and chloride are the dominant anions counting for 44 and 29 of the total anions in meq l respectively plotting the groundwater samples from the two aquifers in a piper diagram diamond shape revealed that the b5 b4 aquifer is primarily a ca mg cl water type 55 followed by a ca mg hco3 type 41 and a na cl water type 4 fig 5 a the ca mg hco3 type refers to the groundwater samples influenced by the dissolution of carbonate formations such as limestones and dolomites this type of water represents freshwater that is not affected by human activities and recently infiltrated el yaaouti et al 2009 the ca mg cl water type is indicative of cation exchange processes due to mixing with more saline waters such as those showing a na cl water type the samples collected from the b2 a7 aquifer were plotted in the ca mg hco3 type in the diamond shape indicating carbonate dissolution of ca mg bearing minerals nitrate concentration in groundwater samples of b5 b4 aquifer ranged from 14 to 251 mg l with an average of 79 mg l whereas for b2 a7 aquifer nitrate varied between 19 and 61 mg l with an average of 38 mg l fig 4b the maximum nitrate concentration was reported for the groundwater sample 13 of b5 b4 aquifer located in the vicinity of the rwwtp other potential sources of contamination include agricultural synthetic fertilizers animal husbandry and septic tanks in general the highest values of no3 and ec in the b5 b4 aquifer were found in the eastern ramtha area and northwestern parts of the aquifer where cesspools are used for sanitation purposes obeidat et al 2008 obeidat et al 2013a 2013b found that the depth to groundwater hydraulic conductivity and lineaments density were the main factors that control the b5 b4 vulnerability to contamination in ramtha area about 66 of the samples from the b2 a7 aquifer showed no3 concentrations higher than the natural background indicating the influence of nitrogen pollution originating from human activities the most important influential factors that dictate the aquifer vulnerability to contamination in the study area include depth to water table soil cover rock types and recharge rate margane et al 1999 ramtha east part b5 b4 aquifer um qais west part b5 b4 aquifer and nuaimeh areas b2 a7 aquifer were classified as having extremely high vulnerability to pollution this was attributed to shallow water table and low protective cover above the saturated zone awawdeh et al 2015 found that the area surrounding rwwtp was the most vulnerable to contamination because of shallow groundwater table low slope high lineaments density and high hydraulic conductivity the high correlation between ec and ca mg na cl and so4 was attributed to groundwater salinity originating from water rock interaction and or pollution from anthropogenic activities table 2 the significant correlation r 0 99 between na and cl indicates a common source of salinity such as mixing with brackish water or dissolution of evaporites the correlation of no3 with k and so4 suggested an agricultural source of pollution synthetic fertilizers and the moderate correlation with cl showed the contamination from a wastewater source the no3 cl ratio was used to primarily discriminate the nitrate pollution sources anornu et al 2107 the value of 0 05 0 22 given by ma et al 2009 and li et al 2017 was adopted as a reference value of no3 cl ratio not affected by human activities anornu et al 2017 according to liu et al 2006 high cl values against low no3 cl ratio reflect effluents and organic wastes however high no3 cl ratio against low cl values reflect agricultural sources and low no3 cl ratio against low cl values reflect denitrification and uptake of no3 by plants the no3 cl ratio for groundwater of b5 b4 aquifer ranged between 0 15 and 3 7 with an average of 1 04 and from 0 7 to 1 3 with an average of 0 93 for the aquifer b2 a7 these values indicated human induced source of no3 in the groundwater resources 4 2 multivariate statistical analysis 4 2 1 k mean cluster analysis the results of the analysis revealed four clusters table s1 cluster 1 represented 22 7 of the samples and the water of this group was mainly classified as of ca mg hco3 water type with the lowest dissolved ions content fig 5b the nitrate concentration was below or slightly higher than the natural background concentration so the water of this group can be considered slightly affected by human activities and water chemistry of this group can be considered as the natural background of the groundwater clusters 2 and 4 included 45 5 and 22 7 of the samples respectively and both clusters showed a ca mg cl water type the two clusters had nitrate cluster centers higher than the maximum who permissible limit 51 mg l for cluster 2 and 153 mg l for cluster 4 cluster 3 contained the samples 12 and 13 from the eastern part of the aquifer ramtha area showing the highest ionic concentrations among the four clusters and its water was classified as na cl or brackish in addition the nitrate concentration was much higher than the who permissible limit 177 7 mg l plotting the four clusters and wastewater in a compositional diagram fig s1 revealed that wastewater was a major source of pollution in the eastern part of the aquifer cluster 2 fell along the mixing line between cluster 1 and cluster 4 indicating a mixture of waters from the two clusters the relationship between no3 cl ratio and cl concentration of the four clusters fig 6 showed that cluster 3 has high cl concentration and low no3 cl ratio indicating a manure septic source of nitrate cluster 4 showed a high no3 cl ratio and relatively low cl concentration reflecting an agricultural fertilizers source of nitrate cluster 1 showed low concentrations of nitrate and chloride close or slightly higher than the natural background indicating limited nitrogen pollution 4 2 2 principal component analysis the results of pca for hydrochemical parameters of the b5 b4 table 3 revealed that the contribution of the first three factors factor 1 factor 2 and factor 3 is 66 0 13 3 and 12 6 respectively accounting for approximately 92 0 of the total variance the loadings for the varimatrix rotated factor matrix in the three factors model are shown in table 3 factor 1 showed strong positive loadings of ec tds cl so4 na and mg and moderate positive loading of no3 this factor was termed the salinity factor due to water rock interactions evaporation processes and anthropogenic impact other researches indicated that infiltration of domestic wastewater often leads to increase in major ions concentrations such as cl na k ca no3 and tds e g zhu et al 2019 wang et al 2017 kim et al 2009 the moderate positive loading of nitrate indicated a common source of groundwater salinization and nitrogen pollution natural sources of groundwater salinity include mixing of fresh groundwater with paleo seawater water rock interaction saline surface water and marine aerosols kloppmann et al 2014 re and zuppi 2011 anthropogenic sources include salt water intrusion due to over pumping industrial activities domestic solid and liquid waste disposal mining and agricultural activities appelo and postma 2005 qin et al 2013 han et al 2015 liu et al 2019 re and sacchi 2017 the association of no3 and so4 indicates anthropogenic influence on the water quality through synthetic fertilizers and domestic wastewater el yaaouti et al 2009 qin et al 2013 das and nag 2017 aravinthasamy et al 2019 the highest scores for factor 1 are mainly found in the area surrounding rwwtp in the easternmost part of the aquifer fig s2 a study carried out by obeidat et al 2013a 2013b indicated that rwwtp was the main pollution source of nitrate in b5 b4 aquifer beneath the plant factor 2 accounted for about 13 3 of the total variance exhibiting strong positive association with ca and hco3 and strong negative association with ph this correlation could likely be attributed to the dissolution of the hosting rocks e g limestone indicating a water rock interaction factor the high negative loading of ph reflects the influence of acid base conditions on groundwater chemistry dragon 2008 the weak positive loading of mg indicates that factor 2 is partly controlled by the dissolution of mg bearing minerals such as dolomites the spatial distribution of the factor 2 scores fig s2 showed that water rock interaction is a major process that controls b5 b4 groundwater chemistry this factor reflects the influence of mineral dissolution e g limestones in the groundwater quality the highest scores corresponded mostly to samples located in carbonate formations factor 3 accounted for 12 7 of the total variance and it showed strong positive correlation between no3 and k thus factor 3 was regarded as the nitrate contamination factor most likely due to agricultural fertilizers the highest scores of this factor were observed in the northern and southeastern parts of the b5 b4 aquifer where the depth of the groundwater table is small 40 m a s l and the cultivation is intense the association of k and no3 definitely indicates agricultural sources synthetic fertilizers of pollution singh et al 2017 4 3 stable isotopes of water the stable isotope composition of the groundwater resources in the study area was plotted in a δ 2h δ 18o diagram fig 7 together with the global meteoric water line gmwl the eastern mediterranean meteoric water line emwl and the stable isotope composition of rainfall in jordan 6 27 0 11 δ 18o 11 4 0 66 bajjali 2012 craig 1961 reported that δ18o and δ2h in fresh waters from different countries correlate on a global scale this meteoric relationship was attributed to isotopic fractionation during condensation the line defined by this relationship is known as the global meteoric water line or gmwl and it matches the following equation δ 2 h 8 δ 18 o 10 the constant 10 is called deuterium excess d and it is defined as follows d δ 2 h 8 18 o different local meteoric water lines from various parts of the world have been established the meteoric water line of the middle east or mediterranean mmwl was found to be as follows gat and carmi 1970 δ 2 h 8 δ 18 o 22 for the groundwater of the b2 a7 aquifer the δ 18o values ranged between 6 5 and 5 0 with an average of 6 1 and the δ 2h values ranged between 30 9 and 28 2 with an average of 29 8 table 4 most of the b2 a7 samples were located close to the lmwl of jordan confirming the meteoric origin of the groundwater these samples showed a deuterium excess d excess between 15 3 and 21 with an average of 18 2 the samples were plotted between the gmwl and emwl indicating that this water has been recharged from both continental and mediterranean precipitation verhagen et al 1991 kattan 2019 showed that the origin of the air masses producing rains in the region can be from different areas such as the siberian plateau the northern pole via eastern europe atlantic ocean the northern africa and the red sea bajjali 2012 showed that the cold and dry continental air masses originating from the european continent come in contact with the warm mediterranean sea water resulting in rapid evaporation and large scale convergence the low d excess values in precipitation 16 have been attributed to air masses that cross the north african continent and undergo a local orographic effect the location of the groundwater samples between the emmwl and the gmwl can be attributed to the origin of the air masses producing rainfall over the country which forms the ultimate source of groundwater in the study area from the atlantic ocean with contact with mediterranean sea and from the red sea which has no contact with the mediterranean sea kattan 2019 the samples of b2 a7 showed more negative values and far from the groundwater samples of b5 b4 aquifer indicating that the b2 a7 aquifer was recharged at higher altitudes 850 950 m a s l according to bajjali 2006 and that the interaction between the two aquifers was probably not significant moreover several samples of b2 a7 aquifer deviated from the lmwl towards more enriched values showing that those samples underwent evaporation prior to infiltration or that there was mixing with more enriched waters bajjali 2006 suggested that the groundwater in the nuaimeh area b2 a7 aquifer was a mixture of two sources direct recharge from precipitation and irrigation return flow which could explain the deviation from the lmwl the δ 18o values in groundwater of the b5 b4 aquifer ranged narrowly between 5 1 and 3 5 with an average of 4 6 and the δ 2h values ranged between 28 2 and 18 9 with an average of 22 9 the groundwater samples of the aquifer b5 b4 collected from both the eastern and western part were plotted far from the lmwl and around trend lines which correspond either to an evaporation line or a mixing line between more depleted recharge regions and isotopically more enriched return flow irrigated waters gat 1996 the influence of evaporation effect is confirmed by bajjali 2008 who found that the recharging water of the b5 b4 aquifer in the ramtha area has been subjected to evaporation prior to or during infiltration the samples from the eastern and western part accumulated at isotopically slightly different clouds with the samples from the eastern part of the aquifer showing more enriched isotopic values which was attributed to the difference in the hydrogeological setting of the two areas the topographic relief in the eastern part of the aquifer shows more gentle slopes which favors lower water infiltration velocities and increases the susceptibility to evaporation effect the western part of the aquifer which is dominated by springs shows steeper slopes and thus the water infiltration velocity is faster reducing the exposure to evaporative conditions a strong correlation r 0 94 was observed between δ 18o and cl in four samples samples 12 13 29 and 30 which was attributed to a strong evaporation effect on the isotope composition of the groundwater and to an increased chloride loading from anthropogenic sources mainly from domestic wastewaters rwwtp koh et al 2010 a single factor analysis of variance anova revealed that there is a significant difference between δ 18o values for the samples collected from the eastern and western parts of aquifer b5 b4 f calculated value 5 37 f critical value 4 01 but not a significant difference for δ 2h values between the two areas a single factor analysis of variance anova test confirmed that there is significant difference in both δ 18o f calculated value 120 14 f critical value 4 15 and δ 2h f calculated value 112 19 f critical value 4 15 values between the two aquifers b5 b4 and b2 a7 these differences were overall attributed to different water origins recharge altitudes and interactions between the two aquifers 4 4 stable isotopes of nitrate 4 4 1 b5 b4 aquifer the range of measured δ 15n no3 values in the groundwater samples of the b5 b4 aquifer was between 2 6 and 14 0 with an average 6 8 n 22 table 4 the δ 18o no3 values ranged from 2 3 to 5 9 with an average of 4 1 to primarily identify the predominant no3 sources and transformation processes in the study area a dual isotope bi plot approach δ 15n no3 vs δ 18o no3 was used based on kendall et al 2007 fig 8 a the nitrate isotope data for five samples 6 12 13 20 and 22 fell into the manure septic waste source window these samples showed δ 15n no3 values ranging between 8 6 and 14 1 which are in agreement with the values reported for no3 derived from manure 10 to 20 and domestic wastewater 7 to 15 matiatos 2016 and more specifically in the range for water dominated by sewage 4 to 19 given by xue et al 2009 the same samples exhibited δ 18o no3 values in the range of 3 5 and 5 9 which are typically below 15 reported for δ 18o no3 derived from sewage mayer et al 2002 these samples showed nitrate concentration in the range of 69 251 mg l with an average of 146 mg l the main source of nitrate in these samples is domestic wastewaters this is supported by the fact that cesspools are still used for the disposal of the household sewage especially in the western and middle parts of the aquifer moreover high e coli content has been reported for the same sampling points particularly for sites 12 and 13 eng kefah mrayan water authority of jordan personal commun additionally a wastewater treatment plant is located in the middle of the eastern part of the aquifer see table 4 for explanation of land use land cover the nitrate isotope values of samples 1 2 3 4 7 8 9 10 16 17 18 and 21 fell in the overlapping window of manure septic waste and soil samples 1 2 3 4 10 18 and 21 showed nitrate concentration higher than the who 2011 standards ranging between 52 and 216 mg l with an average of 114 mg l the main source of nitrogen pollution was considered urban cesspools samples 7 8 9 16 and 17 showed nitrate concentration 14 36 mg l closer to the natural background value of nitrate concentration in fresh groundwaters indicating that nitrogen pollution is not as significant as in the other areas five samples 5 11 14 15 and 19 were plotted in the overlapping area between the fields soil manure septic waste and nh4 in fertilizer and precipitation these samples showed nitrate values between 15 and 34 mg l which are higher than the natural background and are located in cultivated areas therefore nitrogen pollution in these samples probably originated from nitrified fertilizers e g nh4 fertilizers 4 4 2 b2 a7 aquifer the range of measured δ 15n no3 values for the b2 a7 was between 3 2 and 6 7 with an average of 5 6 n 6 the δ 18o no3 values ranged from 1 5 to 2 8 with an average of 2 2 five samples from the b2 a7 aquifer samples 23 24 25 26 and 28 fell in the overlapping window of manure septic waste and soil and one sample 27 fell in the overlapping area of soil manure septic waste and nh4 in fertilizer and precipitation fig 8a all samples showed nitrate concentration in the range of 19 61 mg l which is higher than the natural background the main land use land cover in this part of the study area is cropland and urban thus the main sources of nitrogen pollution in these samples were attributed to wastewaters samples 23 24 25 26 and 28 and nitrified fertilizers sample 27 the single factor analysis of variance anova test showed that there was no significant difference between δ 15n values for the two aquifers b5 b4 and b2 a7 indicating a common source of nitrogen however the test indicated that there was a significant difference between δ 18o values for the samples collected from the two aquifers where f calculated 20 368 is greater than f critical 4 225 and the p value 0 0001 is 0 05 it can be concluded that the two aquifers have a common source of nitrate but a different source of water different stable isotope composition as mentioned in the subsection 4 3 stable isotopes of water there is a significant difference in the water isotopes δ18o h2o and δ2h h2o for the two aquifers this difference is reflected in the oxygen isotope of nitrate δ 18o no3 since it is assumed that the theoretical δ 18o no3 produced by bacterial nitrification incorporates two oxygen atoms from the ambient groundwater and one oxygen atom form the atmospheric oxygen according to the following g equation kendall et al 2007 t h e o r e t i c a l δ 18 o n o 3 2 3 δ 18 o h 2 o 1 3 δ 18 o o 2 4 5 biogeochemical processes the theoretical δ 18o no3 produced by bacterial nitrification was calculated using δ 18o values measured for the groundwater in the study area table 4 assuming δ 18o of atmospheric o2 23 5 according the following equation kendall et al 2007 δ 18 o n o 3 2 3 δ 18 o h 2 o 1 3 δ 18 o o 2 the δ 18o values of microbially produced no3 are up to 5 higher than the calculated theoretical maximum of 10 aravena et al 1993 kendall 1998 mayer et al 2002 xue et al 2009 eight samples from b5 b4 aquifer showed δ 18o no3 values consistent with the theoretical δ 18o no3 values 3 samples showed δ 18o no3 values slightly higher that the theoretical ones and 11 samples exhibited δ 18o no3 values slightly lower than the theoretical ones overall the average δ 18o no3 4 1 value was close to the average theoretical δ 18o no3 4 8 value for nitrification all samples collected from b2 a7 aquifer showed δ 18o no3 values lower than the theoretical δ 18o no3 values indicating that other processes might be masking the nitrification process the relationship between nitrate concentration and δ 15n and δ 18o of nitrate values can also be used to assess biogeochemical processes such as denitrification affecting nitrate isotopic composition and mixing processes zhang et al 2018a b kim et al 2015 otero et al 2009 in denitrification the δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 values of nitrate increase as nitrate concentration decreases during nitrate reduction this biogeochemical process generates δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 ratios from 1 1 3 to 1 2 liu et al 2006 as illustrated in fig 8a it is not likely that significant denitrification processes occur in the groundwater bodies the fact that nitrate concentration and each of δ 15n and δ 18o values for the b5 b4 aquifer showed no clear cut correlation fig 8b and c and the high do concentration 6 1 8 8 mg l in all water samples confirmed that denitrification is either masked or unlikely to occur 4 6 siar mixing model for the b5 b4 aquifer the results showed that the lowest contribution was for the source synthetic fertilizers where it ranged from 2 to 5 with an average of 4 table 5 the contribution of the source nitrified synthetic fertilizers ranged from 10 to 74 with an average of 49 the contribution of the source anthropogenic organic matter ranged from 20 to 85 with an average of 46 the highest contribution of this source 85 was recorded for sample 12 which was collected in the vicinity of ramtha wastewater treatment plant rwwtp the highest contribution of the nitrified synthetic fertilizers was found for samples collected from the middle parts of the study area for the b2 a7 aquifer the contribution of the source synthetic fertilizers ranged from 2 to 3 with an average of 2 the contribution of the source nitrified synthetic fertilizers ranged from 52 to 79 with an average of 61 the contribution of the source anthropogenic organic matter ranged from 18 to 45 with an average of 36 results also showed that the contribution of the source nitrified synthetic fertilizers was higher for the b2 a7 aquifer whereas the contribution of the source anthropogenic organic matter was higher for the b5 b4 aquifer the siar model gives an estimation of the proportional contribution as it incorporates high uncertainty moreover the model output reflected the contribution of the different nitrate sources at a specific sampling time matiatos 2016 this study revealed that groundwater resources in the study area were contaminated where nitrate levels were far exceeding the natural background concentration modeling of the nitrate isotopes showed that nitrified synthetic fertilizers and septic manure waste are the main sources of contamination this contamination entails costly environmental and socioeconomic impacts thus and to achieve sustainability of the groundwater resources in the study area immediate measures should be undertaken to reduce pollutants inputs and to protect water resources for example best management practices to manage land and human activities to mitigate pollution of water resources are crucial in this concern these may include plant nutrients input management increasing irrigation efficiency animal feedlots management and awareness campaigns for the farmers to take their role in protecting natural resources moreover treated untreated domestic wastewater disposal management is a core necessity proper land use planning of the study area should be developed which involves locating pollution sources on those areas which have low vulnerability to contamination in this concern depth to water table thickness of the protective cover and climate should be taken into account groundwater protection zones should be demarcated around wells and springs 5 conclusions an integrated approach of hydrochemical statistical and isotopic methods was applied to assess groundwater quality of two unconfined aquifers in northern jordan the hydrochemistry of the b5 b4 aquifer showed high spatial variation reflecting different factors processes controlling its groundwater quality k means cluster analysis classified the groundwater samples of b5 b4 aquifer in four clusters where cluster 1 represented less nitrate polluted groundwaters whereas clusters 2 3 and 4 showed the highest nitrate concentrations originating from different sources as evidenced by the difference in the no3 cl ratios the pca resulted in a three factor model which explained approximately 92 of the total variance of the dataset and enabled the identification of the hydrogeological processes controlling the groundwater quality of b5 b4 aquifer and the evolution of the water chemistry from ca mg hco3 to na cl based on the water isotope results δ 2h and δ 18o the eastern part of the b5 b4 is characterized by stronger evaporation effect compared to the western and middle parts of the aquifer nitrogen isotope values showed that wastewater manure and nitrified synthetic fertilizers are the dominant sources of nitrate in the b5 b4 and b2 a7 aquifers the average contributions of these sources in the b5 b4 were 46 and 49 whereas their contribution in the b2 a7 were 36 and 61 respectively statistical analysis showed that the two aquifers have a common source of nitrate but different recharge areas this study highlighted the use of environmental isotopes combined with multivariate statistical analysis in locating sources of nitrate contamination in groundwater leading to a more effective planning of environmental measures to protect groundwater from pollution such as better agricultural e g fertilization manure application and storage of animal manures and sanitation practices e g better design of pit latrines and septic tanks sewer leakage

12018,water scarcity is one of the major problems facing the worldwide humankind due to the growing population water pollution and climate change therefore producing freshwater using simple low cost technology has become a main challenge for researchers recently several research studies aiming the improvement of the solar still devices have inferred that the wick type solar stills are among the most effective and efficient distillers in the present work an attempt is made to present the current status of wick solar stills highlighting the main innovations and improvements the geometrical design wick arrangements and heating system integration appear to have significant effects on enhancing the freshwater productivity of the wick type solar still the wick solar distiller in tilted shape increases the efficiency by around 60 in comparing to the conventional system installing a rotating wick cloth provides high efficiency between 66 and 84 integrating a parabolic concentrator solar tracking system with wick solar still enhances the productivity by 676 furthermore this work critically reviewed the influence of providing various wick materials on the thermal efficiency of not only the conventional distillers but also of several configurations of solar still device this comparative review presents a reference guide for future researchers intending to improve the performance of wick type solar stills and focus on the most efficient techniques graphical abstract image 1 keywords solar still solar energy wick cloths drinking water wick materials efficiency 1 introduction solar distillation in small scale devices is a cost effective technology which presents a conceivable alternative solution for reducing the global water stress and supplying safe drinking water in many regions around the world several designs and technological innovations have been introduced by the scientific community with the aim of coupling renewable energy and desalination processes for freshwater production the solar still is the simplest device among the solar distillation systems and its principle is based on evaporation and condensation processes das et al 2020 the conventional solar still can be described as a basin with a top cover of transparent material like glass or plastic the inner surface of the basin is blackened to efficiently absorb the entering solar radiation the solar energy passing through the transparent cover heats up the brine water in the basin the vapor then rises and condenses on the underside of the top cover kaviti et al 2016 a tremendous amount of research studies were carried out during the last few years with the aim of developing several possible configurations of solar stills based on theoretical and experimental approaches sampathkumar et al 2010 arunkumar et al 2019 increasing the amount of drinking water output was the focus of intensive investigations selvaraj and natarajan 2018 thus many studies inferred that the best distillate yield is achieved by improving the evaporation process further investigations revealed that the evaporation rate is proportional to the water exposure area inside the still selvaraj and natarajan 2018 therefore using a black porous wick supported by a tray or a frame inside the solar still has a significant effect on increasing the free water surface and improving the evaporation rate kaviti et al 2016 through the wick the feed water slowly flows and gets evaporated once receiving the solar energy and condenses on the inner surface of the glass cover bhattacharyya 2013 thereby the black wick cloth acts as a surface of sunrays absorption and water transport medium simultaneously mahdi et al 2011 the wick covering all the surface area of the basin is characterized by a high capillarity action property that leads to rising the brine temperature by increasing its residence time and reducing the water depth inside the still mahdi et al 2011 however wick type solar stills also have some drawbacks the first major problem is the degradation of the wick material and the clogging of its pores due to salt deposition in addition it is difficult to carefully control the brine flow in order to avoid the dry spots throughout the wick surface mahdi et al 2011 in this context many research studies were developed in order to test several wick materials and to select the best choice that ensures a high performance of the still hansen et al 2015 among the earlier used wick in solar distillation devices is the jute cloth the latter is the most popular natural material that was used because of its low cost and large availability sakthivel et al 2010 many researchers used the jute cloth inside the solar still such as prakash et al 2016 and pal et al 2017 agrawal et al 2018 conducted experimental research for wick solar stills in rewa india the results showed that integrating the jute cloth offered a large evaporation surface area to the system it led to an increase in the cumulative distillate yield by 62 higher than that of solar still without blackened jute on the other hand charcoal cloth has high solar absorption properties thus it was integrated as heat absorber medium in many research studies such as mahdi et al 2011 and ouar et al 2017 several investigations were established with the aim of comparing the performance of wick type solar stills based on testing different integrated wick materials as presented in table 1 furthermore many research studies inferred that the efficiency of the wick type solar stills could be improved not only by selecting the right wicking material but also by investigating some internal and external modifications on the wick configuration and the still design usually the wick type solar still is briefly cited in the literature reviews in the field of solar distillation as a traditional solar still integrated with a wick cloth instead of using simple absorber plate however numerous interesting research studies have been developed recently for improving the performance of wick type solar distillers by investigating different designs and several internal and external modifications most of these investigations proved that coupling the use of absorbing wick material with appropriate enhancements provides a high significant distillate output accordingly the present study focuses on describing the design specifications and highlighting numerous improvements of the wick solar stills up on which research efforts have been focusing in the recent past all the considered research studies are classified into three main categories according to their improvement methodologies namely wick solar stills with various geometrical designs with various wick cloth arrangements and with different integrated heating systems each section ends with relevant research points analysis and a critical discussion furthermore the major limitations and the research gaps in the introduced investigations are identified in this review also several alternative propositions for wick type solar still improvement are provided therefore this research work presents an extensive review of state of the art and a comprehensive critical analysis of the most important optimizations in the field of water desalination by using wick cloths together with solar energy see table 2 2 wick type solar stills with various geometrical designs the wick type solar still has gained the interest of many solar distillation research groups with the aim of developing improved design while maintaining the simplicity and low cost in this section wick type solar stills with different configurations are discussed 2 1 wick solar still in tilted form the wick solar still in tilted shape is one of the simplest devices that offer a suitable angle to the sun thus it enhances the absorption of the sunrays and reduces the reflection aybar et al 2016 tilted wick solar still at 30 of inclination was studied by munisamy et al 2017 the experimental investigation was carried out with the aim of testing the efficiency of four proposed wick materials jute polyester terrycloth and fur fabric and identifying their effects on enhancing the evaporation process inside the inclined still device the obtained results indicated that the maximum daily yield of 3 63 l d 1 was achieved in the case of using the fur fabric as a wick material in tilted shape in addition the researchers suggested installing many vertical plates within the absorber in order to increase the residence time of the brine water flowing inside the distiller sharon et al 2017 carried out an interesting comparative research between a tilted solar still with simple basin and an inclined wick type distiller the black blended woolen wick installed in tilted profile was used as sunrays absorber medium in order to heat up the brine water in continuous flow every 30 min as results of this study the daily average and maximum operating temperatures of the inclined wick solar still were found higher by around 5 c than that of the solar distiller with simple basin furthermore sharshir et al 2020 investigated the performance of an inclined solar still by integrating a novel wick metal chips pad and testing different basin materials such as aluminum copper and steel the solar distiller was tilted with an angle of 20 and all the external walls and bottom were insulated by using a foam sheet the theoretical and experimental results inferred that the inclined solar still with copper basin and the novel wick copper chips had a maximum thermal efficiency of 61 while it was limited to 37 for the simple inclined solar still in a study by aybar et al 2016 the effect of covering the absorber plate with black fleece wick on the productivity of double inclined solar still was investigated theoretically and experimentally the proposed setup can be described as two connected rectangular boxes tilted at an angle of 35 the comparative study between the single and the double tilted solar stills with and without black fleece wick affirmed that an enhancement of 39 in the hourly average efficiency was obtained for the double inclined distiller with wick cloth the augmented productivity of the proposed solar distiller was the result of the increased solar radiation received by the tilted system the good distribution of water upon the wick material and the improved evaporation and condensation processes inside the upper and the lower part 2 2 basin wick solar still with single or double slope a single slope basin wick solar still was investigated by ouar et al 2017 with the purpose of testing the effect of different absorbent materials on the performance of the enhanced system the experimental tests were carried out during spring in southern algeria the results of this study concluded that the addition of absorber material in the bottom of the single slope basin solar still increased significantly the nocturnal productivity due to the heat energy storage compared to the conventional solar distiller the experimental results revealed that the productivity enhancements were 25 18 and 7 in the case of using the bitumen coating charcoal and black ink respectively furthermore gnanaraj and velmurugan 2019 designed and build three double slope basin solar stills with the same dimensions and with different internal modifications such as finned corrugated basin still with black granite and still with wick the comparative study between the several improvements showed that the daily productivity enhancement of the double slope basin wick solar still was 42 due to the increased evaporation rate during the day in another study a single basin solar still incorporated in a double slope basin wick distillation device was studied by rajaseenivasan et al 2015 in order to reduce the heat losses and increase the freshwater productivity the glass covers of the two integrated boxes were at 30 of inclination and the basin situated above had three partitions at each side to enhance the water surface area the effect of installing different wick and energy storage materials on the performance of the proposed system was investigated by developing an exergy analysis of the evaporation process the authors have inferred that the exergy evaporation of the enhanced device was estimated as 79 while it was limited to 54 for the conventional still 2 3 wick solar still in pyramid shape the use of a pyramid shape for the glass cover on the solar still was investigated in many studies with the aim of enhancing the condensation surface area and rising the temperature difference between the evaporation and condensation surfaces sathyamurthy et al 2014 prakash et al 2016 studied the performance of a pyramid solar still which consisted of four glass sides connected to a double plywood basin with glass wool in between for high thermal insulation the performed experiments with and without wick indicated that the highest global internal heat transfer was obtained for the pyramid solar still with wick cloth therefore 50 of average efficiency and 5 25 l m 2 d 1 of daily productivity were achieved for the pyramid wick solar distiller 2 4 wick solar still with v profile a wick type solar sill with v shape was introduced and studied by suneesh et al 2016 through a thin layer of cotton gauze arranged on the glass cover the water flows to the center of the still and then is passed to a special tank from where it is fed into the still upon the inclined wick the angle of inclination of the tilted wick and the feed water flow rate were optimized in this study the performed experiments proved that the v type inclined wick solar still has a higher performance compared to the conventional system the high yield output of the proposed device was achieved due to the hot water feeding on the wicks which enhances the evaporation rate furthermore a 20 wick inclination and 200 ml min 1 of mass flow rate were confirmed as optimum conditions 2 5 wick solar still in tubular shape the design and efficiency of a wick solar still in cylindrical shape was investigated by elashmawy 2017 a comparative study between the use of black cotton cloth inside a rectangular trough and half cylindrical trough without wick material was developed theoretically and experimentally under the climatic conditions of saudi arabia the results of this study affirmed that the tubular solar still integrated with a porous black wick yielded 4 21 l m 2 d 1 which presents an enhancement of around 17 compared to the system without wick regarding the economic analysis the cost for 1 l of freshwater produced was 0 033 and 0 044 for the proposed device with and without wick material respectively among the different geometrical configurations cited above the tilted wick type solar still is considered the most convenient and cost effective device based on its simple design and high efficiency first the simplicity of the tilted solar still design is manifested in offering the possibility to change the inclination according to the altitude of the place and the climatic conditions furthermore the design presents a lightweight structure with much flexibility so that it can be easily transferable and installed in the rooftop of a dwelling the simplicity of design and operation of the inclined solar distiller leads to a lower cost per liter of freshwater produced therefore it would be preferable to keep the simplest geometrical shape and focus on the internal wick arrangement to improve the performance of the wick type solar stills the different geometrical modifications are presented in fig 1 3 wick type solar stills with various wick cloth arrangements as evidence from the aforementioned survey the external engineering design of the wick solar still could play a useful role in improving the productivity and the efficiency of the system nevertheless many other researchers have inferred that modifying the structure and arrangement of the wick cloths inside the solar still can contribute significantly to the enhancement of the distillation process and the performance of the solar distillers 3 1 solar still with small pile of wick materials modi and modi 2019 suggested a new arrangement of the wick material in the shape of a small pile immersed in water instead of covering the entire basin surface testing of the efficiency of the proposed configuration for two wick materials jute and the black cotton cloth and for two different water depths 0 01 and 0 02 m were carried out experimentally using a simple slope double basin solar still and under the spring climate of gujarat india as a result of this study the small pile of jute immersed in 0 01 m of water depth in the lower basin yielded 0 91 l m 2 h 1 of total maximum freshwater output therefore the overall productivity of the jute in a small pile shape was 18 higher than the black cotton cloth within the same structure 3 2 solar still with partially covered wick in 2017 suneesh et al 2017 studied the effect of using a different arrangement of wick material inside a v solar still configuration instead of the baseline design the basin was partially covered by the black porous wick with periodic cavities the experiments revealed that the temperatures of the glass cover and the wick material were higher in the case of using the proposed configuration than the completely covered basin which led to a quick rate of evaporation and an increased yield therefore the solar still with fully covered basin by wick yielded 3 3 l m 2 d 1 at 25 of inclination whereas the system with partially covered basin produced a little bit higher distillate of 3 65 l m 2 d 1 3 3 solar still with wick in rectangular grooves and ridges arrangement anburaj et al 2013 investigated the effect of using different wick cloths arranged on an aluminum tray with five sets of rectangular grooves and ridges inside a tilted solar still black cotton cloth waste cotton pieces jute cloth and other porous materials were tested with the proposed absorber structure further experiments were performed in this study to optimize the inclination angles 25 30 and 35 of the system the results showed that the optimum inclination of the improved setup was 30 furthermore the study inferred that placing the black cotton cloth on the absorber plate with rectangular grooves and ridges had the greatest effect on the productivity enhancement 4 21 l d 1 compared to the other wick materials 3 4 basin solar still with corrugated wick the influence of integrating wick cloths in corrugated shape inside a simple basin solar still was analyzed by matrawy et al 2015 a mathematical model based on energy balance equations and various experimental tests of the proposed device were developed the authors concluded that the black wick installed in a corrugated profile significantly increased the evaporative area and reduced the heat capacity of the water therefore the daily productivity of the enhanced system raised by 34 compared to the conventional system kassem 2016 also examined the performance of a basin solar still integrated with black wick in a corrugated shape the modified setup and a classic solar distiller were tested under the same climatic conditions in saudi arabia the performed experiments indicated that the temperature of the jute cloth with a corrugated form could reach 82 c however it was 76 c for the simple absorber plate of the conventional system furthermore the efficiency of the new configuration was about 59 while it was found only 46 for the simple device 3 5 basin solar still with stepped wick el agouz 2014 proposed an improved configuration of wick cloth inside the solar still a layer of cotton cloth covered an absorber plate that was inclined at angle of 30 with the horizontal design in stepped shape the modified stepped wick solar still aimed to enhance the freshwater productivity by increasing the surface area of brine water exposed to solar energy and enhancing the distribution of water with continuous circulation at low depth an experimental study was conducted to investigate the performance of the proposed solar distiller with feeding the device with seawater and saltwater with 40 772 and 1681 mg l 1 of total dissolved solids tds respectively the results inferred that the daily efficiency of the modified stepped wick solar still were 53 and 47 for sea and saltwater respectively with an enhancement of 20 compared to the conventional solar still after desalination the total dissolved solids tds of seawater and salt water were 41 and 27 mg l 1 respectively sharshir and eltawil 2020 studied the performance of a double slope basin solar still that integrated linen wicks in a stepped structure inside the still linen wicks were installed on steps to transport the brine water from the water basin located in the middle of the solar distiller the wick cloths were used as a heat storage material and the stepped shape was proposed to increase the absorption surface area the improved wick configuration enhanced the distillate output and the energy efficiency by 35 and 53 respectively compared to the conventional solar still furthermore the cost for 1 l of freshwater produced by the improved stepped wick solar still was 20 lower than that of the traditional design 3 6 solar still with vertical attached wick sakthivel et al 2010 studied the use of jute cloth as a storage material placed vertically in the middle of a simple basin solar still next to another attached wick towards the rear wall a mathematical modeling was carried out with the aim of analyzing the heat and mass transfer mechanisms and predicting the hourly yield the theoretical and experimental results showed that the highest efficiency of the proposed concept was 52 compared to the classic solar still due to the increased evaporation surface area and the regeneration of the condensation heat agrawal et al 2018 proposed an improved design of basin type solar still with using the jute cloth as a wick material inside the basin box an inclined galvanized iron sheet was installed and covered by the blackened jute cloth in addition the backside wall was wrapped by the jute material with keeping its lower part dipped into the brine water energy balance equations were developed in this study with the aim of predicting the temperature of the different parts and the efficiency of the setup based on the elaborated thermal models and the performed experiments it was concluded that the use of wick in the modified layout could enhance the evaporation rate significantly therefore the cumulative yield was increased by around 62 compared to the conventional solar still 3 7 solar still with moving controlled wick the idea of integrating a rotating wick inside the solar still was suggested by gad el gayar and gad 2011 and it aimed at enhancing the performance of the system with decreasing the cost of produced freshwater inside a titled solar still a black cloth wick was installed being able to rotate in a controlled alternative cycle using a computer program the high thermal efficiency of the system was established when the wick was immersed during 30 s in water and then exposed to the solar radiation for 25 s in 2017 another study was established based on investigating the use of a vertical rotating wick inside an improved basin type solar still haddad et al 2017 the enhanced configuration included three glass walls connected to a rectangular wooden box in the base and to an inclined glass cover of 36 on the top inside the still a rotating black jute cloth was placed in a vertical position with keeping its lower part dunked into water the rotating wick was driven by a controlled dc motor the experimental results revealed that the productivity of the proposed system was 5 l m 2 d 1 in winter and around 7 l m 2 d 1 during summer the daily efficiency of the improved system could reach 66 in summer in the same context abdullah et al 2019 installed a horizontal and vertical rotating wick system controlled by dc motor the proposed design led to an increase of the surface area for more solar radiation absorption and to an improvement of the heat and mass transfer processes inside the still in addition the results of this study inferred that the efficiency of solar distillers with rotating wick achieved 84 and 82 with and without integrating nanofluid materials respectively 3 8 solar still with multi wicks pal et al 2017 developed an experimental study of a double slope multi wick solar still the modified design could be described as a rectangular fibre reinforced plastic basin frp with three transparent acrylic sheets east west and south walls inside the still nineteen wicks were gradually settled with the highest one in the center they were separated by 10 cm between every two wicks to facilitate the water flow the significant thermal efficiency improvement was achieved owing to the high incident solar radiation through the transparent acrylic walls as well as the use of black cotton for the multi wicks the greatest output gain was 4 5 l m 2 d 1 with a water level of 2 cm in 2018 the same design was theoretically investigated by pal et al 2018 based on energy exergy and enviro economic analysis the hourly yield of the proposed solar still was calculated as the sum of the distillate output collected from the south basin wall and the two sides of the glass cover the maximum energy and exergy instantaneous efficiencies were estimated as 35 and 4 at 17 00 h respectively moreover a single basin solar still with multiple v shape floating wicks was theoretically and experimentally investigated by agrawal and rana 2019 during the summer and winter seasons in india the black jute cloths were installed in a v shaped profile with an angle of 24 in order to increase the evaporation surface area and maximize the absorbed solar energy due to this specific configuration the evaporation area was increased by 26 compared to the conventional system the daily yield of the modified setup reached 6 2 l m 2 in summer and 3 23 l m 2 in winter furthermore based on an economical investigation it was estimated that the annual costs of the produced fresh water could be 1 84 rs l 0 026 l based on the above investigations it can be concluded that the rotating wick system presents the most efficient design compared to the several proposed internal wick configurations the highest efficiency provided by the rotating wick cloth can reach between 66 and 84 moreover using a rotating wick belt inside the solar distiller has a significant improving effect on the performance of the still it offers the opportunity for wick and water to absorb more solar heat and converting the free evaporation to forced evaporation hence a relevant enhancement in the evaporation rate is achieved without the occupancy of a larger horizontal space on the other hand the period of rotating wick operation should be optimized by controlling the dc motor function which can be connected to a photovoltaic solar panel for energy supply 4 wick type solar stills with different coupled systems a number of research works have focused on enhancing the energy efficiency and productivity of the wick solar still by integrating various external improvements such as incorporating a glass cooling system multi effect diffusion and flat plate collectors in this section several external developments integrated to the wick solar still device are configured with the aim of increasing the rate of evaporation and condensation processes and enhancing the amount of produced freshwater the coupled systems used for wick solar still improvement are presented in fig 2 4 1 wick type solar still with glass film cooling sharshir et al 2016 have developed an analytic investigation of a wick type solar still with a glass film cooling system that was supplied by hot water leaving a humidification dehumidification hdh unit a mathematical modeling was introduced in this study based on solving the performed energy balance equations using matlab software the obtained average productivity of the improved solar still was increased by 278 and 210 in comparison to that of the system without glass film cooling and of the conventional basin solar still respectively recently tiwari and somwanshi 2018 developed a theoretical study and economic analysis of a small distillation device composed of single slope multi wick solar stills connected to a fountain reservoir for glass cover cooling the obtained results indicated that the productivity increased with a low glass cooling water flow which would raise the yearly efficiency by about 61 4 2 solar still with tilted wick attached to single or multiple effect diffusion solar still tanaka and iishi 2017 have presented an improved design of a solar distillation device based on coupling single effect diffusion still with a tilted wick solar still initially the saltwater is fed into the system from the top of the single effect diffusion still and it is evaporated once it receives the solar radiation the remaining brine water continues the path to the wick of the second unit wick solar still where it gets evaporated and condensed the condensation heat coming from the first unit and the latent heat of the vapor transferred by naturel convection constitutes the energy source of the second unit the experimental results indicated that the maximum daily yield of the coupled device could reach 4 88 l m 2 d 1 when the daily horizontal solar radiation was 13 6 mj m 2 d 1 and the daily incident solar radiation was 18 4 mj m 2 d 1 furthermore tanaka 2017 developed a parametric investigation of a vertical multiple effect diffusion solar still coupled to a titled wick still in order to identify the optimum conditions the maximum daily yield was obtained for 30 inclination of the tilted device and for 20 mm and 10 mm of air gaps between double glass covers of the first unit and the second unit respectively as well the author proved that the daily efficiency increased with the minimum distance between the plates of the multi effect diffusion unit and with low flow rate of brine water further a floating wick basin still coupled with a vertical multiple effect diffusion still and with waste heat recovery was investigated by kaushal et al 2017a and kaushal et al 2017b with the aim of reducing the thermal inertia of the evaporating surface multi floating cotton cloth wicks were arranged vertically inside the basin in addition the heat of the brine water output were used for preheating the feed water the productivity of the new system was enhanced by 21 compared to the conventional basin type solar still and it was noticed a significant nocturnal productivity of 1 34 l m 2due to the high stored heat inside the floating wick 4 3 wick type solar still with integrated reflector the benefit of coupling a flat plate bottom reflector to the tilted wick solar still has been investigated by tanaka 2015 geometrical models were developed with the aim of calculating the optimum inclination of the solar device and the reflector as well as determining the best position of the reflector in this study the total amount of solar radiation was calculated as the sum of the solar radiation reflected from the bottom of the flat plate reflector and that absorbed by the wick the obtained results inferred that the proposed reflector offered a high potential of solar radiation absorption thus a high distillate yield was achieved the annual productivity of the enhanced design increased by 28 19 and 14 due to the coupled reflector with 0 0 5 and 1 m of gap length from the still respectively in 2018 tanaka 2018 introduced an analytical study of a vertical multi wick diffusion solar still coupled with an enlarged flat plate reflector the author found that the overall daily yield is directly proportional to the size of the integrated reflector therefore the daily productivity of the improved device coupled to a flat plate reflector with length and width equal to 3 m was increased by 27 in comparison to that of the still coupled to a reflector with length and width equal to 1 m 4 4 wick type solar stills coupled with solar water heating system parabolic concentrator solar pond omara et al 2013 introduced an experimental study to investigate the effect of coupling an inclined wick solar still with an external solar water heating system the evacuated solar water heater was composed of 20 vacuum glass tubes the feed water is preheated due to the convective heat exchange process between the heat transfer fluid placed inside the tubes and the brackish water thereafter the hot brine water is distributed on the surface of a jute linen woven cloth inside the still the external solar water heating system had a significant effect on increasing the evaporation rate and improving the daily and nocturnal productions the results of this study inferred that the overall productivity of the proposed design was enhanced by 215 in comparison to the classic solar still owing to the continuous feeding of hot brackish water especially during night elashmawy 2017 proposed to integrate a parabolic concentrator solar tracking system to a tubular solar still in coaxial form in order to increase the water temperature through the raised amount of absorbed solar radiation hence a high significant productivity enhancement of 676 was achieved in 2018 dhindsa and mittal 2018 carried out an experimental study of a basin type vertical multiple effect diffusion solar still coupled to multiple floating wicks and a mini solar pond the integrated system was used for providing the stored heat during the day to the solar still during the night with the aim of generating nocturnal productivity and boosting the performance of the device due to the additional heat given by the coupled mini solar pond the nocturnal yield was increased by 71 in comparison to the conventional system as reported in this section several active and passive heat sources such as water heater reflectors and solar concentrators were used for improving the heat transfer inside the system and accelerating the distillation process as a result these technologies provide a higher distillate output however most integrated systems are rather complicated technically demanding and cost intensive in addition most of these techniques need specific materials that are not readily available or accessible in many rural or remote areas 5 limitations of previous research studies and innovative alternatives in summary there are currently large amounts of investigations highlighting the diverse internal and external technologies applied for enhancing the productivity of the wick type solar still as a main objective nevertheless very limited studies were developed regarding the quality of produced drinking water in addition to the issues of highly mineralized water output and the possible valorization methods of the brine by product the assurance of good quality freshwater could be performed by a simple continuous monitoring of some physicochemical parameters during the distillation process such as ph conductivity dissolved organic carbon doc and microbial quality indications controlling the water quality and several internal and external parameters that have a significant effect on the performance of the still device could be automatically maintained using a system of sensors and a microcontroller that can be installed and programmed in order to keep the process constantly at the optimum likewise many design and climatic parameters like thickness of insulation material thickness of glass cover wind speed and ambient temperature were overlooked in some studies because of the large number of required experiments and the complicated experimental approaches in this context several design of experiment doe methods are available and widely used as a tool for determining the relationship between factors affecting the distillation process and optimizing the solar distiller systems in an efficient way and with a reduced number of performed experiments wagner et al 2014 many researchers have proposed enhancing the evaporation and condensation processes by integrating several external systems such as solar concentrator reflectors hdh unit and others these integrated systems are rather complicated and heavy calling for a high cost and high level maintenance on the other hand improving the distillation process by reducing the condensation heat losses through the transparent cover to the ambient could be a great approach for enhancing the productivity without requiring a high level mechanical system thus recycling of the water vapor to a second condensation surface area using forced convection and transferring the heat energy to the bulk water will offer the possibility of increasing the temperature and enhancing the evaporation rate developing an efficient and lightweight solar still could be achieved through the choice of adequate top transparent cover characteristics such as type of material and thickness in general glass is the traditional option as a transparent top cover due to its low price and easy availability however glass is a relatively heavy material and has a high potential for breakage that make it inappropriate and unsafe for some solar still installations in the other hand using fluoropolymer materials such as etfe ethylene tetra fluoro ethylene represent a promoting alternative for a lightweight top cover instated of the glass the etfe film has strong bonds to avoid degradation of the material under adverse weather conditions and ultraviolet radiation it is also characterized by high durability good resistance at high temperatures and good thermal properties furthermore the etfe foil has a significant potential of solar transmission between 92 and 95 and a relatively low weight of about 175 g m 2 for a film thickness of 100 μm cremers and marx 2016 the majority of studies have focused on selecting the most cost effective wick with good capillary action and high absorption of solar radiation nevertheless the durability and the lifespan properties of the porous black material have been neglected the long term sun exposure and the highly saline water promote the degradation of the wick structure with time and decrease the resistance to fading whereas innovative solutions for more lasting absorber material with excellent resistance to degradation were still limited until the near past 6 conclusions a summary of previous researches developments and evaluations of various designs of wick type solar stills have been presented and discussed in this review many types of wick solar stills have been introduced and investigated differing one from the other in geometry construction materials wick configurations and external integrated improvements most of the above listed wick distiller investigations revealed that the integration of wick cloth is the most effective way to enhance the evaporation process and significantly improve the distillate output likewise many studies proved that the engineering design of the wick solar still could contribute to an improved distillation process furthermore several theoretical and experimental investigations inferred that the arrangement and the structure of the wick materials inside the solar still significantly enhance the performance of the device as well the efficiency of coupling various external heating and solar concentrator systems to the wick solar still were validated by many research works these technologies were proposed as convenient tools for enhancing the performance of the system however they are relatively complicated in their structures finally it can be concluded from this review that using wick cloths as absorber evaporating surface inside the solar still have significant and sustainable effects on the solar distillation process moreover more efforts are required to investigate several design and climatic parameters such as condensing surface insulation materials wind speed and specially to focus more optimizing the chemical physical and biological parameters of the produced drinking water furthermore several improvements could be achieved to build an efficient solar still like using system automation and alternative mode of condensation in order to make the solar distillation device more viable environmentally friendly and beneficial for humankind declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

12018,water scarcity is one of the major problems facing the worldwide humankind due to the growing population water pollution and climate change therefore producing freshwater using simple low cost technology has become a main challenge for researchers recently several research studies aiming the improvement of the solar still devices have inferred that the wick type solar stills are among the most effective and efficient distillers in the present work an attempt is made to present the current status of wick solar stills highlighting the main innovations and improvements the geometrical design wick arrangements and heating system integration appear to have significant effects on enhancing the freshwater productivity of the wick type solar still the wick solar distiller in tilted shape increases the efficiency by around 60 in comparing to the conventional system installing a rotating wick cloth provides high efficiency between 66 and 84 integrating a parabolic concentrator solar tracking system with wick solar still enhances the productivity by 676 furthermore this work critically reviewed the influence of providing various wick materials on the thermal efficiency of not only the conventional distillers but also of several configurations of solar still device this comparative review presents a reference guide for future researchers intending to improve the performance of wick type solar stills and focus on the most efficient techniques graphical abstract image 1 keywords solar still solar energy wick cloths drinking water wick materials efficiency 1 introduction solar distillation in small scale devices is a cost effective technology which presents a conceivable alternative solution for reducing the global water stress and supplying safe drinking water in many regions around the world several designs and technological innovations have been introduced by the scientific community with the aim of coupling renewable energy and desalination processes for freshwater production the solar still is the simplest device among the solar distillation systems and its principle is based on evaporation and condensation processes das et al 2020 the conventional solar still can be described as a basin with a top cover of transparent material like glass or plastic the inner surface of the basin is blackened to efficiently absorb the entering solar radiation the solar energy passing through the transparent cover heats up the brine water in the basin the vapor then rises and condenses on the underside of the top cover kaviti et al 2016 a tremendous amount of research studies were carried out during the last few years with the aim of developing several possible configurations of solar stills based on theoretical and experimental approaches sampathkumar et al 2010 arunkumar et al 2019 increasing the amount of drinking water output was the focus of intensive investigations selvaraj and natarajan 2018 thus many studies inferred that the best distillate yield is achieved by improving the evaporation process further investigations revealed that the evaporation rate is proportional to the water exposure area inside the still selvaraj and natarajan 2018 therefore using a black porous wick supported by a tray or a frame inside the solar still has a significant effect on increasing the free water surface and improving the evaporation rate kaviti et al 2016 through the wick the feed water slowly flows and gets evaporated once receiving the solar energy and condenses on the inner surface of the glass cover bhattacharyya 2013 thereby the black wick cloth acts as a surface of sunrays absorption and water transport medium simultaneously mahdi et al 2011 the wick covering all the surface area of the basin is characterized by a high capillarity action property that leads to rising the brine temperature by increasing its residence time and reducing the water depth inside the still mahdi et al 2011 however wick type solar stills also have some drawbacks the first major problem is the degradation of the wick material and the clogging of its pores due to salt deposition in addition it is difficult to carefully control the brine flow in order to avoid the dry spots throughout the wick surface mahdi et al 2011 in this context many research studies were developed in order to test several wick materials and to select the best choice that ensures a high performance of the still hansen et al 2015 among the earlier used wick in solar distillation devices is the jute cloth the latter is the most popular natural material that was used because of its low cost and large availability sakthivel et al 2010 many researchers used the jute cloth inside the solar still such as prakash et al 2016 and pal et al 2017 agrawal et al 2018 conducted experimental research for wick solar stills in rewa india the results showed that integrating the jute cloth offered a large evaporation surface area to the system it led to an increase in the cumulative distillate yield by 62 higher than that of solar still without blackened jute on the other hand charcoal cloth has high solar absorption properties thus it was integrated as heat absorber medium in many research studies such as mahdi et al 2011 and ouar et al 2017 several investigations were established with the aim of comparing the performance of wick type solar stills based on testing different integrated wick materials as presented in table 1 furthermore many research studies inferred that the efficiency of the wick type solar stills could be improved not only by selecting the right wicking material but also by investigating some internal and external modifications on the wick configuration and the still design usually the wick type solar still is briefly cited in the literature reviews in the field of solar distillation as a traditional solar still integrated with a wick cloth instead of using simple absorber plate however numerous interesting research studies have been developed recently for improving the performance of wick type solar distillers by investigating different designs and several internal and external modifications most of these investigations proved that coupling the use of absorbing wick material with appropriate enhancements provides a high significant distillate output accordingly the present study focuses on describing the design specifications and highlighting numerous improvements of the wick solar stills up on which research efforts have been focusing in the recent past all the considered research studies are classified into three main categories according to their improvement methodologies namely wick solar stills with various geometrical designs with various wick cloth arrangements and with different integrated heating systems each section ends with relevant research points analysis and a critical discussion furthermore the major limitations and the research gaps in the introduced investigations are identified in this review also several alternative propositions for wick type solar still improvement are provided therefore this research work presents an extensive review of state of the art and a comprehensive critical analysis of the most important optimizations in the field of water desalination by using wick cloths together with solar energy see table 2 2 wick type solar stills with various geometrical designs the wick type solar still has gained the interest of many solar distillation research groups with the aim of developing improved design while maintaining the simplicity and low cost in this section wick type solar stills with different configurations are discussed 2 1 wick solar still in tilted form the wick solar still in tilted shape is one of the simplest devices that offer a suitable angle to the sun thus it enhances the absorption of the sunrays and reduces the reflection aybar et al 2016 tilted wick solar still at 30 of inclination was studied by munisamy et al 2017 the experimental investigation was carried out with the aim of testing the efficiency of four proposed wick materials jute polyester terrycloth and fur fabric and identifying their effects on enhancing the evaporation process inside the inclined still device the obtained results indicated that the maximum daily yield of 3 63 l d 1 was achieved in the case of using the fur fabric as a wick material in tilted shape in addition the researchers suggested installing many vertical plates within the absorber in order to increase the residence time of the brine water flowing inside the distiller sharon et al 2017 carried out an interesting comparative research between a tilted solar still with simple basin and an inclined wick type distiller the black blended woolen wick installed in tilted profile was used as sunrays absorber medium in order to heat up the brine water in continuous flow every 30 min as results of this study the daily average and maximum operating temperatures of the inclined wick solar still were found higher by around 5 c than that of the solar distiller with simple basin furthermore sharshir et al 2020 investigated the performance of an inclined solar still by integrating a novel wick metal chips pad and testing different basin materials such as aluminum copper and steel the solar distiller was tilted with an angle of 20 and all the external walls and bottom were insulated by using a foam sheet the theoretical and experimental results inferred that the inclined solar still with copper basin and the novel wick copper chips had a maximum thermal efficiency of 61 while it was limited to 37 for the simple inclined solar still in a study by aybar et al 2016 the effect of covering the absorber plate with black fleece wick on the productivity of double inclined solar still was investigated theoretically and experimentally the proposed setup can be described as two connected rectangular boxes tilted at an angle of 35 the comparative study between the single and the double tilted solar stills with and without black fleece wick affirmed that an enhancement of 39 in the hourly average efficiency was obtained for the double inclined distiller with wick cloth the augmented productivity of the proposed solar distiller was the result of the increased solar radiation received by the tilted system the good distribution of water upon the wick material and the improved evaporation and condensation processes inside the upper and the lower part 2 2 basin wick solar still with single or double slope a single slope basin wick solar still was investigated by ouar et al 2017 with the purpose of testing the effect of different absorbent materials on the performance of the enhanced system the experimental tests were carried out during spring in southern algeria the results of this study concluded that the addition of absorber material in the bottom of the single slope basin solar still increased significantly the nocturnal productivity due to the heat energy storage compared to the conventional solar distiller the experimental results revealed that the productivity enhancements were 25 18 and 7 in the case of using the bitumen coating charcoal and black ink respectively furthermore gnanaraj and velmurugan 2019 designed and build three double slope basin solar stills with the same dimensions and with different internal modifications such as finned corrugated basin still with black granite and still with wick the comparative study between the several improvements showed that the daily productivity enhancement of the double slope basin wick solar still was 42 due to the increased evaporation rate during the day in another study a single basin solar still incorporated in a double slope basin wick distillation device was studied by rajaseenivasan et al 2015 in order to reduce the heat losses and increase the freshwater productivity the glass covers of the two integrated boxes were at 30 of inclination and the basin situated above had three partitions at each side to enhance the water surface area the effect of installing different wick and energy storage materials on the performance of the proposed system was investigated by developing an exergy analysis of the evaporation process the authors have inferred that the exergy evaporation of the enhanced device was estimated as 79 while it was limited to 54 for the conventional still 2 3 wick solar still in pyramid shape the use of a pyramid shape for the glass cover on the solar still was investigated in many studies with the aim of enhancing the condensation surface area and rising the temperature difference between the evaporation and condensation surfaces sathyamurthy et al 2014 prakash et al 2016 studied the performance of a pyramid solar still which consisted of four glass sides connected to a double plywood basin with glass wool in between for high thermal insulation the performed experiments with and without wick indicated that the highest global internal heat transfer was obtained for the pyramid solar still with wick cloth therefore 50 of average efficiency and 5 25 l m 2 d 1 of daily productivity were achieved for the pyramid wick solar distiller 2 4 wick solar still with v profile a wick type solar sill with v shape was introduced and studied by suneesh et al 2016 through a thin layer of cotton gauze arranged on the glass cover the water flows to the center of the still and then is passed to a special tank from where it is fed into the still upon the inclined wick the angle of inclination of the tilted wick and the feed water flow rate were optimized in this study the performed experiments proved that the v type inclined wick solar still has a higher performance compared to the conventional system the high yield output of the proposed device was achieved due to the hot water feeding on the wicks which enhances the evaporation rate furthermore a 20 wick inclination and 200 ml min 1 of mass flow rate were confirmed as optimum conditions 2 5 wick solar still in tubular shape the design and efficiency of a wick solar still in cylindrical shape was investigated by elashmawy 2017 a comparative study between the use of black cotton cloth inside a rectangular trough and half cylindrical trough without wick material was developed theoretically and experimentally under the climatic conditions of saudi arabia the results of this study affirmed that the tubular solar still integrated with a porous black wick yielded 4 21 l m 2 d 1 which presents an enhancement of around 17 compared to the system without wick regarding the economic analysis the cost for 1 l of freshwater produced was 0 033 and 0 044 for the proposed device with and without wick material respectively among the different geometrical configurations cited above the tilted wick type solar still is considered the most convenient and cost effective device based on its simple design and high efficiency first the simplicity of the tilted solar still design is manifested in offering the possibility to change the inclination according to the altitude of the place and the climatic conditions furthermore the design presents a lightweight structure with much flexibility so that it can be easily transferable and installed in the rooftop of a dwelling the simplicity of design and operation of the inclined solar distiller leads to a lower cost per liter of freshwater produced therefore it would be preferable to keep the simplest geometrical shape and focus on the internal wick arrangement to improve the performance of the wick type solar stills the different geometrical modifications are presented in fig 1 3 wick type solar stills with various wick cloth arrangements as evidence from the aforementioned survey the external engineering design of the wick solar still could play a useful role in improving the productivity and the efficiency of the system nevertheless many other researchers have inferred that modifying the structure and arrangement of the wick cloths inside the solar still can contribute significantly to the enhancement of the distillation process and the performance of the solar distillers 3 1 solar still with small pile of wick materials modi and modi 2019 suggested a new arrangement of the wick material in the shape of a small pile immersed in water instead of covering the entire basin surface testing of the efficiency of the proposed configuration for two wick materials jute and the black cotton cloth and for two different water depths 0 01 and 0 02 m were carried out experimentally using a simple slope double basin solar still and under the spring climate of gujarat india as a result of this study the small pile of jute immersed in 0 01 m of water depth in the lower basin yielded 0 91 l m 2 h 1 of total maximum freshwater output therefore the overall productivity of the jute in a small pile shape was 18 higher than the black cotton cloth within the same structure 3 2 solar still with partially covered wick in 2017 suneesh et al 2017 studied the effect of using a different arrangement of wick material inside a v solar still configuration instead of the baseline design the basin was partially covered by the black porous wick with periodic cavities the experiments revealed that the temperatures of the glass cover and the wick material were higher in the case of using the proposed configuration than the completely covered basin which led to a quick rate of evaporation and an increased yield therefore the solar still with fully covered basin by wick yielded 3 3 l m 2 d 1 at 25 of inclination whereas the system with partially covered basin produced a little bit higher distillate of 3 65 l m 2 d 1 3 3 solar still with wick in rectangular grooves and ridges arrangement anburaj et al 2013 investigated the effect of using different wick cloths arranged on an aluminum tray with five sets of rectangular grooves and ridges inside a tilted solar still black cotton cloth waste cotton pieces jute cloth and other porous materials were tested with the proposed absorber structure further experiments were performed in this study to optimize the inclination angles 25 30 and 35 of the system the results showed that the optimum inclination of the improved setup was 30 furthermore the study inferred that placing the black cotton cloth on the absorber plate with rectangular grooves and ridges had the greatest effect on the productivity enhancement 4 21 l d 1 compared to the other wick materials 3 4 basin solar still with corrugated wick the influence of integrating wick cloths in corrugated shape inside a simple basin solar still was analyzed by matrawy et al 2015 a mathematical model based on energy balance equations and various experimental tests of the proposed device were developed the authors concluded that the black wick installed in a corrugated profile significantly increased the evaporative area and reduced the heat capacity of the water therefore the daily productivity of the enhanced system raised by 34 compared to the conventional system kassem 2016 also examined the performance of a basin solar still integrated with black wick in a corrugated shape the modified setup and a classic solar distiller were tested under the same climatic conditions in saudi arabia the performed experiments indicated that the temperature of the jute cloth with a corrugated form could reach 82 c however it was 76 c for the simple absorber plate of the conventional system furthermore the efficiency of the new configuration was about 59 while it was found only 46 for the simple device 3 5 basin solar still with stepped wick el agouz 2014 proposed an improved configuration of wick cloth inside the solar still a layer of cotton cloth covered an absorber plate that was inclined at angle of 30 with the horizontal design in stepped shape the modified stepped wick solar still aimed to enhance the freshwater productivity by increasing the surface area of brine water exposed to solar energy and enhancing the distribution of water with continuous circulation at low depth an experimental study was conducted to investigate the performance of the proposed solar distiller with feeding the device with seawater and saltwater with 40 772 and 1681 mg l 1 of total dissolved solids tds respectively the results inferred that the daily efficiency of the modified stepped wick solar still were 53 and 47 for sea and saltwater respectively with an enhancement of 20 compared to the conventional solar still after desalination the total dissolved solids tds of seawater and salt water were 41 and 27 mg l 1 respectively sharshir and eltawil 2020 studied the performance of a double slope basin solar still that integrated linen wicks in a stepped structure inside the still linen wicks were installed on steps to transport the brine water from the water basin located in the middle of the solar distiller the wick cloths were used as a heat storage material and the stepped shape was proposed to increase the absorption surface area the improved wick configuration enhanced the distillate output and the energy efficiency by 35 and 53 respectively compared to the conventional solar still furthermore the cost for 1 l of freshwater produced by the improved stepped wick solar still was 20 lower than that of the traditional design 3 6 solar still with vertical attached wick sakthivel et al 2010 studied the use of jute cloth as a storage material placed vertically in the middle of a simple basin solar still next to another attached wick towards the rear wall a mathematical modeling was carried out with the aim of analyzing the heat and mass transfer mechanisms and predicting the hourly yield the theoretical and experimental results showed that the highest efficiency of the proposed concept was 52 compared to the classic solar still due to the increased evaporation surface area and the regeneration of the condensation heat agrawal et al 2018 proposed an improved design of basin type solar still with using the jute cloth as a wick material inside the basin box an inclined galvanized iron sheet was installed and covered by the blackened jute cloth in addition the backside wall was wrapped by the jute material with keeping its lower part dipped into the brine water energy balance equations were developed in this study with the aim of predicting the temperature of the different parts and the efficiency of the setup based on the elaborated thermal models and the performed experiments it was concluded that the use of wick in the modified layout could enhance the evaporation rate significantly therefore the cumulative yield was increased by around 62 compared to the conventional solar still 3 7 solar still with moving controlled wick the idea of integrating a rotating wick inside the solar still was suggested by gad el gayar and gad 2011 and it aimed at enhancing the performance of the system with decreasing the cost of produced freshwater inside a titled solar still a black cloth wick was installed being able to rotate in a controlled alternative cycle using a computer program the high thermal efficiency of the system was established when the wick was immersed during 30 s in water and then exposed to the solar radiation for 25 s in 2017 another study was established based on investigating the use of a vertical rotating wick inside an improved basin type solar still haddad et al 2017 the enhanced configuration included three glass walls connected to a rectangular wooden box in the base and to an inclined glass cover of 36 on the top inside the still a rotating black jute cloth was placed in a vertical position with keeping its lower part dunked into water the rotating wick was driven by a controlled dc motor the experimental results revealed that the productivity of the proposed system was 5 l m 2 d 1 in winter and around 7 l m 2 d 1 during summer the daily efficiency of the improved system could reach 66 in summer in the same context abdullah et al 2019 installed a horizontal and vertical rotating wick system controlled by dc motor the proposed design led to an increase of the surface area for more solar radiation absorption and to an improvement of the heat and mass transfer processes inside the still in addition the results of this study inferred that the efficiency of solar distillers with rotating wick achieved 84 and 82 with and without integrating nanofluid materials respectively 3 8 solar still with multi wicks pal et al 2017 developed an experimental study of a double slope multi wick solar still the modified design could be described as a rectangular fibre reinforced plastic basin frp with three transparent acrylic sheets east west and south walls inside the still nineteen wicks were gradually settled with the highest one in the center they were separated by 10 cm between every two wicks to facilitate the water flow the significant thermal efficiency improvement was achieved owing to the high incident solar radiation through the transparent acrylic walls as well as the use of black cotton for the multi wicks the greatest output gain was 4 5 l m 2 d 1 with a water level of 2 cm in 2018 the same design was theoretically investigated by pal et al 2018 based on energy exergy and enviro economic analysis the hourly yield of the proposed solar still was calculated as the sum of the distillate output collected from the south basin wall and the two sides of the glass cover the maximum energy and exergy instantaneous efficiencies were estimated as 35 and 4 at 17 00 h respectively moreover a single basin solar still with multiple v shape floating wicks was theoretically and experimentally investigated by agrawal and rana 2019 during the summer and winter seasons in india the black jute cloths were installed in a v shaped profile with an angle of 24 in order to increase the evaporation surface area and maximize the absorbed solar energy due to this specific configuration the evaporation area was increased by 26 compared to the conventional system the daily yield of the modified setup reached 6 2 l m 2 in summer and 3 23 l m 2 in winter furthermore based on an economical investigation it was estimated that the annual costs of the produced fresh water could be 1 84 rs l 0 026 l based on the above investigations it can be concluded that the rotating wick system presents the most efficient design compared to the several proposed internal wick configurations the highest efficiency provided by the rotating wick cloth can reach between 66 and 84 moreover using a rotating wick belt inside the solar distiller has a significant improving effect on the performance of the still it offers the opportunity for wick and water to absorb more solar heat and converting the free evaporation to forced evaporation hence a relevant enhancement in the evaporation rate is achieved without the occupancy of a larger horizontal space on the other hand the period of rotating wick operation should be optimized by controlling the dc motor function which can be connected to a photovoltaic solar panel for energy supply 4 wick type solar stills with different coupled systems a number of research works have focused on enhancing the energy efficiency and productivity of the wick solar still by integrating various external improvements such as incorporating a glass cooling system multi effect diffusion and flat plate collectors in this section several external developments integrated to the wick solar still device are configured with the aim of increasing the rate of evaporation and condensation processes and enhancing the amount of produced freshwater the coupled systems used for wick solar still improvement are presented in fig 2 4 1 wick type solar still with glass film cooling sharshir et al 2016 have developed an analytic investigation of a wick type solar still with a glass film cooling system that was supplied by hot water leaving a humidification dehumidification hdh unit a mathematical modeling was introduced in this study based on solving the performed energy balance equations using matlab software the obtained average productivity of the improved solar still was increased by 278 and 210 in comparison to that of the system without glass film cooling and of the conventional basin solar still respectively recently tiwari and somwanshi 2018 developed a theoretical study and economic analysis of a small distillation device composed of single slope multi wick solar stills connected to a fountain reservoir for glass cover cooling the obtained results indicated that the productivity increased with a low glass cooling water flow which would raise the yearly efficiency by about 61 4 2 solar still with tilted wick attached to single or multiple effect diffusion solar still tanaka and iishi 2017 have presented an improved design of a solar distillation device based on coupling single effect diffusion still with a tilted wick solar still initially the saltwater is fed into the system from the top of the single effect diffusion still and it is evaporated once it receives the solar radiation the remaining brine water continues the path to the wick of the second unit wick solar still where it gets evaporated and condensed the condensation heat coming from the first unit and the latent heat of the vapor transferred by naturel convection constitutes the energy source of the second unit the experimental results indicated that the maximum daily yield of the coupled device could reach 4 88 l m 2 d 1 when the daily horizontal solar radiation was 13 6 mj m 2 d 1 and the daily incident solar radiation was 18 4 mj m 2 d 1 furthermore tanaka 2017 developed a parametric investigation of a vertical multiple effect diffusion solar still coupled to a titled wick still in order to identify the optimum conditions the maximum daily yield was obtained for 30 inclination of the tilted device and for 20 mm and 10 mm of air gaps between double glass covers of the first unit and the second unit respectively as well the author proved that the daily efficiency increased with the minimum distance between the plates of the multi effect diffusion unit and with low flow rate of brine water further a floating wick basin still coupled with a vertical multiple effect diffusion still and with waste heat recovery was investigated by kaushal et al 2017a and kaushal et al 2017b with the aim of reducing the thermal inertia of the evaporating surface multi floating cotton cloth wicks were arranged vertically inside the basin in addition the heat of the brine water output were used for preheating the feed water the productivity of the new system was enhanced by 21 compared to the conventional basin type solar still and it was noticed a significant nocturnal productivity of 1 34 l m 2due to the high stored heat inside the floating wick 4 3 wick type solar still with integrated reflector the benefit of coupling a flat plate bottom reflector to the tilted wick solar still has been investigated by tanaka 2015 geometrical models were developed with the aim of calculating the optimum inclination of the solar device and the reflector as well as determining the best position of the reflector in this study the total amount of solar radiation was calculated as the sum of the solar radiation reflected from the bottom of the flat plate reflector and that absorbed by the wick the obtained results inferred that the proposed reflector offered a high potential of solar radiation absorption thus a high distillate yield was achieved the annual productivity of the enhanced design increased by 28 19 and 14 due to the coupled reflector with 0 0 5 and 1 m of gap length from the still respectively in 2018 tanaka 2018 introduced an analytical study of a vertical multi wick diffusion solar still coupled with an enlarged flat plate reflector the author found that the overall daily yield is directly proportional to the size of the integrated reflector therefore the daily productivity of the improved device coupled to a flat plate reflector with length and width equal to 3 m was increased by 27 in comparison to that of the still coupled to a reflector with length and width equal to 1 m 4 4 wick type solar stills coupled with solar water heating system parabolic concentrator solar pond omara et al 2013 introduced an experimental study to investigate the effect of coupling an inclined wick solar still with an external solar water heating system the evacuated solar water heater was composed of 20 vacuum glass tubes the feed water is preheated due to the convective heat exchange process between the heat transfer fluid placed inside the tubes and the brackish water thereafter the hot brine water is distributed on the surface of a jute linen woven cloth inside the still the external solar water heating system had a significant effect on increasing the evaporation rate and improving the daily and nocturnal productions the results of this study inferred that the overall productivity of the proposed design was enhanced by 215 in comparison to the classic solar still owing to the continuous feeding of hot brackish water especially during night elashmawy 2017 proposed to integrate a parabolic concentrator solar tracking system to a tubular solar still in coaxial form in order to increase the water temperature through the raised amount of absorbed solar radiation hence a high significant productivity enhancement of 676 was achieved in 2018 dhindsa and mittal 2018 carried out an experimental study of a basin type vertical multiple effect diffusion solar still coupled to multiple floating wicks and a mini solar pond the integrated system was used for providing the stored heat during the day to the solar still during the night with the aim of generating nocturnal productivity and boosting the performance of the device due to the additional heat given by the coupled mini solar pond the nocturnal yield was increased by 71 in comparison to the conventional system as reported in this section several active and passive heat sources such as water heater reflectors and solar concentrators were used for improving the heat transfer inside the system and accelerating the distillation process as a result these technologies provide a higher distillate output however most integrated systems are rather complicated technically demanding and cost intensive in addition most of these techniques need specific materials that are not readily available or accessible in many rural or remote areas 5 limitations of previous research studies and innovative alternatives in summary there are currently large amounts of investigations highlighting the diverse internal and external technologies applied for enhancing the productivity of the wick type solar still as a main objective nevertheless very limited studies were developed regarding the quality of produced drinking water in addition to the issues of highly mineralized water output and the possible valorization methods of the brine by product the assurance of good quality freshwater could be performed by a simple continuous monitoring of some physicochemical parameters during the distillation process such as ph conductivity dissolved organic carbon doc and microbial quality indications controlling the water quality and several internal and external parameters that have a significant effect on the performance of the still device could be automatically maintained using a system of sensors and a microcontroller that can be installed and programmed in order to keep the process constantly at the optimum likewise many design and climatic parameters like thickness of insulation material thickness of glass cover wind speed and ambient temperature were overlooked in some studies because of the large number of required experiments and the complicated experimental approaches in this context several design of experiment doe methods are available and widely used as a tool for determining the relationship between factors affecting the distillation process and optimizing the solar distiller systems in an efficient way and with a reduced number of performed experiments wagner et al 2014 many researchers have proposed enhancing the evaporation and condensation processes by integrating several external systems such as solar concentrator reflectors hdh unit and others these integrated systems are rather complicated and heavy calling for a high cost and high level maintenance on the other hand improving the distillation process by reducing the condensation heat losses through the transparent cover to the ambient could be a great approach for enhancing the productivity without requiring a high level mechanical system thus recycling of the water vapor to a second condensation surface area using forced convection and transferring the heat energy to the bulk water will offer the possibility of increasing the temperature and enhancing the evaporation rate developing an efficient and lightweight solar still could be achieved through the choice of adequate top transparent cover characteristics such as type of material and thickness in general glass is the traditional option as a transparent top cover due to its low price and easy availability however glass is a relatively heavy material and has a high potential for breakage that make it inappropriate and unsafe for some solar still installations in the other hand using fluoropolymer materials such as etfe ethylene tetra fluoro ethylene represent a promoting alternative for a lightweight top cover instated of the glass the etfe film has strong bonds to avoid degradation of the material under adverse weather conditions and ultraviolet radiation it is also characterized by high durability good resistance at high temperatures and good thermal properties furthermore the etfe foil has a significant potential of solar transmission between 92 and 95 and a relatively low weight of about 175 g m 2 for a film thickness of 100 μm cremers and marx 2016 the majority of studies have focused on selecting the most cost effective wick with good capillary action and high absorption of solar radiation nevertheless the durability and the lifespan properties of the porous black material have been neglected the long term sun exposure and the highly saline water promote the degradation of the wick structure with time and decrease the resistance to fading whereas innovative solutions for more lasting absorber material with excellent resistance to degradation were still limited until the near past 6 conclusions a summary of previous researches developments and evaluations of various designs of wick type solar stills have been presented and discussed in this review many types of wick solar stills have been introduced and investigated differing one from the other in geometry construction materials wick configurations and external integrated improvements most of the above listed wick distiller investigations revealed that the integration of wick cloth is the most effective way to enhance the evaporation process and significantly improve the distillate output likewise many studies proved that the engineering design of the wick solar still could contribute to an improved distillation process furthermore several theoretical and experimental investigations inferred that the arrangement and the structure of the wick materials inside the solar still significantly enhance the performance of the device as well the efficiency of coupling various external heating and solar concentrator systems to the wick solar still were validated by many research works these technologies were proposed as convenient tools for enhancing the performance of the system however they are relatively complicated in their structures finally it can be concluded from this review that using wick cloths as absorber evaporating surface inside the solar still have significant and sustainable effects on the solar distillation process moreover more efforts are required to investigate several design and climatic parameters such as condensing surface insulation materials wind speed and specially to focus more optimizing the chemical physical and biological parameters of the produced drinking water furthermore several improvements could be achieved to build an efficient solar still like using system automation and alternative mode of condensation in order to make the solar distillation device more viable environmentally friendly and beneficial for humankind declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

12019,shapes and pores of biofilm carriers play a major role in deciding fluidization efficiency biomass immobilization and removal efficiency however little is known about their impact on the efficiency of bioremediation this review study sheds light on the function of carrier geometry i e pores and shapes on the bioremediation productivity where the wrong selection of such carrier geometry may prevent attached microbes at the core from accessing nutrients it was found that the ideal porous biofilm carrier undoubtedly has to be spherically shaped with ridges on its surfaces and characterized by larger than 1 mm of irregular pore size openings the irregular pore openings provide various environments to culture various cells develop uneven biofilm and retain different sizes of

organics and inorganics biodegradation processes tausz and donath 1930 today bioremediation is a commonly used method for degrading transforming and chelating various toxic compounds driven by microorganisms by using toxic pollutants as a source of carbon and energy mosa et al 2016 al amshawee and kanthasamy 2018 as microorganisms attach to a solid surface and gradually grow biomass can be

have been presented to largely host microbes reduce the space needed and increase solid retention without the need for biomass recycling al amshawee et al 2020 the specifications of the biofilm carriers signiﬁcantly influence the sustainability of entrapped microorganisms determine the optimum thickness of the biofilm the growth of biomass and the removal rate of pollutants and accordingly

available as solid elements with different specs however the application of biofilm carriers has been associated with substantial complexity because of the large number of undecided specifications involving surface energy wettability compartment size pores surface area roughness and shape see table 1 they result in high variations in biofilm properties over time which leads to difficulties in performing repeatable biofilm studies for comparison lewandowski et al 2004 therefore studying the behavior of biofilm carriers in situ is challenging studies have concluded that the biofilm carrier performance cannot be predicted solely by finding biofilm mass and thickness young et al 2016 ahmad et al 2017 in fact significant removal efficiencies are largely dependent on a high number of pores rough surfaces and hydrodynamic shape which are considerable properties for the initial adhesion and growth of the bioﬁlm æsøy et al 1998 habouzit et al 2011 swain et al 2018 these specifications are able to govern the adsorption capacity and play a vital role in determining biofilm growth and diffusion of substrates and oxygen for instance the right selection of carrier shape can prevent clogging at high loading rates in contrast poor specifications of biofilm carrier may promote low permeability large ﬂow resistance and slow bioﬁlm growth krasňan et al 2016 however young et al 2016 and sonwani et al 2019 noticed very limited attention that has been given to the development of biofilm carrier specifications young et al 2016 sonwani et al 2019 therefore imperfections in the carrier design have largely affected the results of a large number of studies in terms of biofilm growth toughness and function dias et al 2018a morón lópez et al 2019 thus a backwash operation is frequently needed to remove the excess biofilm and control biofilm overgrowth so far there are no studies that solely investigated pores and shapes of biofilm carriers besides little is known about their impact on bioremediation efficiency therefore this review study for the first time defines the shape and surface pores of the biofilm carrier it systematically asks a fundamental question what is the best carrier shape and pore size to provide optimum performance in order to answer that it critically examines past studies that occurred to advance the specifications of biofilm carriers and eventually demonstrates a discussion to whether have or not a high extent of these specifications also it introduces new details that are expected to develop into a useful reference for media shape and pore optimization finally it places recommendations for future studies 2 geometry of biofilm carrier carrier geometry can inﬂuence bioﬁlm structure development resulting in a significant difference in the weight activity and composition of bioﬁlms it is highly correlated with mass transfer and hydraulic efficiency where the proper geometry can successfully provide the needed microenvironment for microbes adhesion and growth dias et al 2018b sajjad et al 2018 it is one of the key factors to increase the amount of attached biomass however various researches could not conclude the effect of geometry on carrier performance for instance li et al 2016 found that the influence of carrier geometry is still undefined for bioﬁlm growth and performance li et al 2016a this section sheds light on the function of carrier geometry involving pores and shapes on the bioremediation productivity where a wrong selection of such carrier geometry may prevent attached microbes at the core from accessing nutrients 2 1 pores pores as part of the biofilm carrier topography are of huge interest to increase surface area enhance initial biomass immobilization offer shelter to biofilm cultures from leakage and sloughing and protect them against crucial environmental situations sun et al 2019 during wastewater treatment maintaining an appropriately sized pore structure absolutely keep biofilm carriers

growth of the cells was observed on the nanometer amplitude 4 20 nm structure surface díaz et al 2007 other studies could develop pseudomonas aeruginosa inside the pores of the polyurethane sponge which largely improved the biodegradation process wan et al 2013 so far only motile bacteria were found at the pores bottom scheuerman et al 1998 fresh polyurethane biofilm carrier has many clear tiny pores i e large or small interstice space it provides interspaces for microorganisms to live and multiply and easily entrap biomass for their growth and maturation feng et al 2012 guo et al 2010 in 1990 fukuzaki et al assessed the influence of 20 30 40 and 50 ppi i e pores per linear inch pore size of polyurethane foam on microbial immobilization fukuzaki et al 1990 the smallest pore size of 50 ppi efficiently immobilized microbial cultures and generated a more densely packed biofilm even during 10 days of shaken conditions the smaller pores could rapidly and stably entrap suspended biomass of 95 while 20 ppi pore size retained only 20 biomass chen et al 2015 examined the impact of sponge pore sizes of 17 45 and 85 ppi on the start up stage in a moving bed bioﬁlm reactor chen et al 2015 the results revealed that the sponge pore size of 45 ppi produced the best performance where it delivered a high biomass concentration of 2136 6 mg l oxygen uptake rate for chemical oxygen demand of 150 1 mg h and oxygen uptake rate for nh4 n of 17 4 mg h therefore the test results of fukuzaki et al 1990 and chen et al 2015 are in agreement of 45 50 ppi pore size as the best possible volume for mass transfer other studies had taken further steps by using glass filter from whatman and duran with pore sizes of 1 0 μm 1 6 μm 2 7 μm 10 16 μm and 160 250 μm as growth surfaces to examine the efficiency of biofilm development inside these small pores pesciaroli et al 2013a fig 1 illustrates the influence of different pore openings on biomass immobilization słomińska et al 2013 preferred to use biofilm carriers composed of supermicropores of 0 7 2 0 nm rather than ultra micropores of 0 7 nm słomińska et al 2013 however feng et al 2015 found that nanopores lead to a reduction in bacterial adherence and much limit their development feng et al 2015 thus chu et al 2011 explained that the right pore size without doubt leads to sufficient mass transfer within the pores and thereby results in the fixation of nitrifiers and ammonium removal chu and wang 2011b however if by any chance of biofilm carriers with very small pore openings e g 1 1 5 nm have been applied it might drastically limit mass diffusion and result in worse substrate and oxygen transport rates to the inner areas ahmad et al 2017 díaz et al 2007 blakey and towler 1988 zhou et al 2008 and xu et al 2020 recommended large pores volume to facilitate the passage of water and bubbles promote the surface area for greater microbial growth and metabolic activities and finally allow a greater and quicker rate of mass transport blakey and towler 1988 zhou et al 2008 xu et al 2020 a study established a comparison between the performance of ceramic and polyurethane in terms of pores wan et al 2013 it proved that a lower degrading efﬁciency is a result of small pore sizes that are incapable of retaining an abundance of suspended cells and biomass wan et al 2013 it was assumed that the size of cells might be much larger than the pores which are greatly prevented from growing inside the small pores despite having evenly distributed internal cavities and enough pores to accommodate all the cells geng et al 2015 another comparative analysis reported by chu et al 2014 which investigated conventional and modified polyurethane biofilm carriers characterized by 280 880 μm and 560 680 μm pore size range respectively chu et al 2014 biofilm was more susceptible to attach to the modified polyurethane carrier than to conventional polyurethane carrier eventually the amount of biofilm attached to modified polyurethane carriers was 1 3 times more than that of conventional polyurethane carriers in contrast to fukuzaki et al 1990 the larger pores of modified polyurethane produced a more complex and diverse community of microbes tarjányi szikora et al 2013 concluded that less than 1 0 mm pore size can largely decrease and limit the penetration extent of oxygen and substrate concentration to the inner pores of biofilm carriers tarjányi szikora et al 2013 fig 2 presents microscopic images of polyurethane sponge and polyvinyl alcohol displaying their distribution and structure of pores pakshirajan et al 2009 randomly packed bed reactor with polyurethane foam having 0 6 0 8 mm average pore size to entrap phanerochaete chrysosporium for biosorption of copper and cadmium pakshirajan and swaminathan 2009 despite the great ability of polyurethane biofilm carrier it achieved maximum ranges of cadmium and copper removal of only 43 and 57 respectively which is greatly underperformance thus it proves the conclusion of tarjányi szikora et al 2013 not to use less than 1 0 mm pore size otherwise an inefficient operation will be presented feng et al 2012 applied polyurethane with larger pore sizes of 1 47 mm for the removal of organics and nitrogen in moving bed biofilm reactors feng et al 2012 it delivered a remarkable ammonium removal efficiency of 96 3 therefore an ideal biofilm carrier undoubtedly has to possess larger than 1 mm pore size openings in 2012 dalahmeh et al tested the same biofilm carrier of feng et al 2012 but with irregular pore openings ranging 1 0 1 6 mm for reducing pollutants from greywater dalahmeh et al 2012 it efficiently reduced chemical oxygen demand and total organic carbon concentrations of 890 130 mg l and 304 mg l to 37 9 mg l and 46 16 mg l respectively yuan et al 2013 decided to explore the performance of a broader range of 0 1 μm 2 mm pore diameter yuan et al 2013 likewise it highly removed chemical oxygen demand nh3 n total nitrogen and total phosphorus of 85 98 62 and 99 respectively in contrast ahmad et al 2017 sun et al 2019 and xu et al 2020 found a uniform pore size results in a stronger aggregation and evenly distributed biomass in the matrix ahmad et al 2017 sun et al 2019 xu et al 2020 other studies found the significant cells and biomass immobilization is due to having a higher number of pores which causes more substrate consumption sonwani et al 2019 studies have also compared different porous biofilm carriers in terms of efficiency for example chu et al 2011 established a comparison between polycaprolactone and polyurethane foam towards depositing numerous microorganisms in their pores chu and wang 2011b polycaprolactone entrapped much lower biomass and delivered a lower nitrification rate than the polyurethane it is because that polycaprolactone could deposit biomass only on its surface compared to polycaprolactone the polyurethane pores had higher rates of entrapped microorganisms as a result of the larger pores size which played a key role in enhancing the housing of microbial cultures and eventually produced a good performance in total organic carbon and ammonium removal besides nitrobacter was found in the interior pores of polyurethane cubes and even mass transfer remained active within the voids this proves that surface diffusion is the main mass transport mechanism of substrates and oxygen it also explains that the mitigation of dissolved oxygen is occurring to stimulate the heterotrophic denitrifying process in 2016 bassin et al examined the mutag biochip carrier which is made for developing a very thin layer of biomass on its surface and a considerable amount of solids inside its pores see fig 3 bassin et al 2016 most of the biomass was entrapped mainly inside the pores which consequently constructed a biofilm layer lower than 0 8 1 2 mm compared to kaldnes biofilm carriers that do not have surface pores mutag biochip carrier is way efficient in the sense of biofilm growth inside the pores and on the surface in 2014 qiao et al reported that the manufacturing of composites as biofilm carriers could possess a higher number and larger size of pores than unmodified biofilm carriers qiao et al 2014 meanwhile krasňan et al 2016 recommended altering the composition of the carrier material during the synthesis stage to enhance the pore size diameter and meet the demands krasňan et al 2016 for example at the time of a ceramic biofilm carrier was being fabricated a chemical reaction was implemented at the room temperature to produce the hydrogen gas muter et al 2017 it successfully left large pores after the solidification of a concentrated suspension of raw materials in a nutshell from all the studies discussed volume and dimensions of pores potentially appear able to govern the rate of the adsorption process onto the biofilm carrier thus it can be used in the near future to a certain extent to simulate and predict the performance of biofilm carriers 2 1 2 clogging of carrier pores the smaller the pore diameter is the less likely the entrapped biomass and cells are to be washed out of the matrix by influent ﬂow and shear forces however the small pores are the first to be clogged when a concentrated influent is applied or excessive biomass is accumulated the clogging easily decreases pore space to transmit nutrients reduces hydraulic conductivity and increases clogging of the ﬁlter bed over time dias et al 2018b kaushik et al 2015 for example when a biomass load was increased during an experiment conducted by toufaily et al 2013 it led to accumulation and excessive growth of bioﬁlm inside the pores and presented a dense biofilm layer on the surface toufaily et al 2013 variable pressure scanning electron microscope showed that the clogging was not uniformed across the pore spaces where some pores maintained their integrity and others were partially clogged young et al 2016 another study confirmed that by reporting that the biomass appeared in the form of dense agglomerates and not covering the whole pore space bassin et al 2016 above all the clogged pores certainly promote lower ammonia biodegradation rates and poor solids settlement on the other hand large pores provide more space for microbial immobilization and development and result in irregular surfaces of not so densely packed biofilms kim et al 2013 yang et al 2015 these surfaces are more open and structured with caverns compared to biofilm growth inside small pores however in a situation where the pores are significantly larger than the immobilized cells they might leak into the environment dzionek et al 2016 therefore the pore size should be sufficient to place microorganisms and to provide the required media inflow in the case of entrapping an excess of biomass and developing dense biofilms shear forces can effectively remove it which keeps the biological processes of biofilms active and optimized inside the pores despite that through an experiment of using sulfur lime porous ceramic carrier having 95 μm pore size inside two identical packed bed bioreactors for no3 n removal han et al 2012 found that the biomass was accumulated mainly because of the large pore size han and koo park 2012 then it blocked the mass transfer once all the biofilm was formed kumar and buitrón 2017 it is possibly due to the deep pores and not large pore opening that developed very tough biofilm layers so it could not promote mass transfer and not even balance the rate of growth to detachment despite the clogging of small and big pores richter and weaver 2003 considered clogging of the pore space is not a problem richter and weaver 2003 in sum this section finds utilizing larger pore opening than 1 mm can assist in retaining a large number of suspended cells and a great amount of biomass besides having a range of irregular pore sizes e g 1 1 5 mm definitely provides various environments which primarily helps to culture various cells and uneven biofilm so simultaneous biological processes can effectively take place e g simultaneous nitrification and denitrification however if too large pore openings have been used shear forces can easily remove most of the attached biofilms and deliver an unstable performance unfortunately due to the limited studies this review study could not determine the largest pore size future studies can consider an extended system of micropores like activated carbon as a perfect geometry to design and distribute pores on a biofilm carrier 2 2 shape the need for a good shape is necessary for an excellent mass transfer to attached microorganisms it plays an essential role in the operation of a bioreactor however it has to meet the essential requirements for achieving good treatment efficiency practical applicability operational simplicity and maximum removal of targeted contaminants tang et al 2017 also it has to retain a large amount of biomass in the system to improve the contact between developed biofilm and suspended contaminants to be degraded carriers have to be greatly shaped to develop uniformed biofilm structures and minimal diffusion limitations krasňan et al 2016 the use of correctly designed carriers represents a great opportunity for the microbial organisms to attach on and assures more than 90 removal efficiency which largely contributes to energy saving tang et al 2017 chernicharo et al 2015 most importantly the shape has to be suitable to be scaled up for use in industrial and municipal wastewater treatment plants despite the importance of carrier shape ødegaard et al 2000 found that the performance obtained with carriers of different shapes did not vary significantly ødegaard et al 2000 it could possibly due to the design of the biofilm process according to the volumetric removal rate therefore the researchers concluded that the shape of biofilm carriers is of less importance as long as the effective surface area is the same in 2003 rodgers and zhan agreed with ødegaard et al 2000 that the specific surface area of the biofilm carriers is the primary design parameter rodgers and zhan 2003 therefore the function and advantages of carrier shape have been largely neglected in favor of an increase in the surface area although following studies of hadjiev et al 2007 paul et al 2007 dias et al 2018 and morgan sagastume 2018 evidently disagreed with ødegaard et al 2000 and rodgers and zhan 2003 by demonstrating that the shape of biofilm carrier essentially determines the hydrodynamic conditions protects biofilms from abrasion and further influences the mass transfer of dissolved oxygen and nutrients dias et al 2018b hadjiev et al 2007 paul et al 2007 morgan sagastume 2018 alvarado lassman et al 2008 reported that the carrier shape is a major factor responsible for the differences in colonization alvarado lassman et al 2008 further ma et al 2009 proved that the shape is the driving force of the reactor performance ma et al 2009 studies still point out that the key parameter of the biofilm carrier is its shape therefore it is an important specification that has to be carefully designed for the optimization of bioreactor performance 2 2 1 shapes of biofilm carriers studies have immobilized microbes on porous and non porous media characterized by unique shapes e g irregular with cavities swain et al 2018 cylindrical with hollow duct al qodah et al 2019 su ungkavatin et al 2019 granular spherical sun et al 2019 flat chip mašić et al 2010 disc shaped geiger and rauch 2017 star shaped hlihor et al 2017 fibrous mccormick et al 2016 parabolic shape bassin et al 2016 ellipsoid shape luo et al 2016 cubic nguyen et al 2018 spindle shape tang et al 2017 o ring barwal and chaudhary 2015 hollow square spiral martín pascual et al 2012 to maximize the active bioﬁlm surface area these different shapes of biofilm carriers have been marketed under various names e g bayvitect buchtmann et al 1997 cosmoball ismail et al 2018 bioball masłoń and tomaszek 2015 kaldnes morgan sagastume 2018 aquacelt cu buchtmann et al 1997 extendosphere alvarado lassman et al 2008 snp zhou et al 2008 anoxkaldnes li et al 2016a aqwise abc5 martín pascual et al 2012 biocons martín pascual et al 2012 lentikats krasňan et al 2016 bioportz abu bakar et al 2018 most of the shapes have a hollow duct with a perforated structure to increase the active mass transport area zhou et al 2008 fig 4 presents most of the novel shapes of biofilm carriers most of the biofilm carriers launched in the market have maintained a cylindrical shape with a cross inside the cylinder and longitudinal fins on the outside for treating small amounts of wastewater e g household or hotel wastewater jing et al 2019 carriers designed with a cross structure in the center can increase the internal surface area of the carrier for microorganism attachment consequently innovated shapes from the original designs have been introduced regardless of its different names all biofilm carriers have common aspects that have been described in scientific literature and available in the market the flat shaped biofilm chip p was introduced to provide the right conditions for the transport of substrates into the biofilm mašić et al 2010 however it could be subjected to shear forces and attrition due to intensive contact with the surrounding liquid and other biofilm media bassin et al 2016 gjaltema et al 1997 and abigail and das 2015 reported that irregularly shaped biofilm carriers could offer more excellent protection for biofilms from liquid shear and turbulence as well as media collisions gjaltema et al 1997 abigail and das 2015 however it would not be practical to find the population of the microbes attached to the irregular surface in fact irregular shapes can take the developments of biofilm carriers to nowhere because it has no baseline theories and consequently leads to significant difficulties thus it greatly does not help to predict the behavior of carrier shape on the microbes cultivation and biodegradation rate in 2012 martín pascual et al observed a different organics removal after using aqwise abc5 kaldnes k1 and biocons biofilm carriers martín pascual et al 2012 biocons required higher hydraulic retention time to deliver similar organics removal of kaldnes k1 and aqwise abc5 carriers undoubtedly the physical and geometrical characteristics of each carrier and their hydraulic behavior are mainly responsible for the different results for some reason other studies considered kaldnes biofilm carriers the preferred design to provide a large surface area for the development of microbial biofilm accinelli et al 2012 ødegaard 2006 it is a cylindrical shaped carrier that has a protected surface area in its inner part which is not subjected to direct collision with other particles it possesses a negative characteristic of biomass accumulating within the inner area of the carrier bassin et al 2016 rauch 2014 the entrapped biomass found in the protected zone is loosely and much susceptible to detachment bassin et al 2016 this can explain the huge increase in the biofilm loss rate as the applied loading rate increases paul et al 2007 found kaldnes incapable of retaining small particles paul et al 2007 zinatizadeh and ghaytooli 2015 used ring form and kaldnes 3 for organic carbon and nitrogen removal from municipal wastewater through simultaneous nitrification and denitrification zinatizadeh and ghaytooli 2015 the ring form delivered higher total nitrogen removal efficiency than kaldnes 3 but the biofilm in the ring form was noticed less stable than that in the system with kaldnes 3 however due to the complexity and dynamics of biofilm carrier shapes pesciaroli et al 2013 found it challenging to sustain an even biofilm distribution into the deep surfaces and difficult in performing repeatable biofilm studies for comparison pesciaroli et al 2013b besides it is hard to extract general design criteria to standardize biofilm carrier shapes different shapes certainly develop biofilms characterized by different properties in connection with the hydrodynamic and mass transport differences imposed by the carrier design therefore there is a clear need for a better understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of the biofilm carrier shape for better prediction of performance and design 2 2 2 corrugated surfaces since the 90s researchers recommended biofilm carriers having ridges or edgy surfaces to increase the effective surface area where flat surfaces force bacteria and bioﬁlm to live as suspension gjaltema et al 1997 garcia et al 1995 müller 1998 rodgers 1999 so carriers can be crossflow corrugated with a corrugation angle of 30 45 or 60 to the horizontal or honeycombed with hexagonal vertical columns rodgers and zhan 2003 manariotis and grigoropoulos 2003 and kermani et al 2008 have employed corrugated carriers like kaldnes for organics and nutrients removal from wastewater manariotis and grigoropoulos 2003 gapes and keller 2009 studied natrix c10 10 and kaldnes k1 where both of the carriers have different internal ﬁn arrangements see fig 5 gapes and keller 2009 nguyen et al 2012 mao et al 2017 irankhah et al 2018 and jing et al 2019 used small cylinders as biofilm carrier which had crosses on the inside of the cylinder and fins on the outside nguyen et al 2012 mao et al 2017 irankhah et al 2018 jing et al 2019 others replaced disc shape carriers with corrugated cylinders to treat sewage tabraiz et al 2016 paul et al 2007 found that the biofilm was thicker between the nearest fins situated on the exterior side of the carrier paul et al 2007 based on further magnifications ahmad et al 2017 and zainab et al 2019 confirmed that the presence of a large number of microscopic ridges or cracks is suitable for further adhesion of anammox and denitrifiers communities which promote a stronger binding of microbial communities onto the carriers ahmad et al 2017 zainab et al 2019 besides ridges can result in the formation of much smaller thicker and complicated interspaces on the carrier surface 2 2 3 clogging of deficient shapes the interspaces of a carrier designed with small open voids are likely to be completely clogged as biofilm thickness increases see fig 6 thereby it does not allow efficient contact between the attached biofilm and the suspended biomass dias et al 2018b the clogged biofilms cannot be discharged and eventually dies due to the lack of substrate and oxygen supply hence a large number of studies noticed biofilm accumulation in the protected internal faces of cylindrical shaped carriers with nearly no bioﬁlm adhesion on the external surfaces see fig 6 dias et al 2018a pastorelli et al 1997 even larger and ﬂat shaped media are also aﬀected by clogging especially when used at high loading rates forrest et al 2016 it is all due to studies and manufacturers that have focused mainly on developing biofilms in the interior of the carriers and gave no attention to enhancing the exterior surfaces however other studies find the overloading is the main reason for the excessive biofilm accumulation at the internal surfaces zidan et al 2015 fiber bundles were proposed as a biofilter because it can sway with the flow which can largely prevent biological and physical fouling caused by biofilms overgrowth li et al 2016b therefore it can be employed for wastewater treatment involving a high organics concentration new carrier developments have to lead to the design of hydrodynamic carriers to prevent clogging significantly it has to widely consider wastewater solids level to promote maximum biofilm thickness control with a constantly exposed biofilm area technically simple in design spherical biofilm carriers are the greatest in terms of colonization rate it has the lowest dead sites less energy intensive even distribution of biofilm around the media less prone to clogging and allows for easy diffusion than any other available designs krasňan et al 2016 dias et al 2018a alvarado lassman et al 2008 it does present a better simultaneous removal of chemical oxygen demand and nitrogen and 70 lower biofilm detachment than the other shapes dias et al 2018a ma et al 2009 if aeration is used cylindrical shaped carriers promote higher detachment rate due to interaction with aeration during initial biofilm formation while the open spherical structure enhances initial biofilm formation and protects the biofilm from shear forces dias et al 2018a spherical shaped media reduce the amount of short circuiting while cylindrical shaped media reduces hydraulic efficiency dias et al 2018b dias et al 2018 achieved higher rates of ammonia removal and oxygen diffusion during a shorter duration using spherical shape media than cylindrical media dias et al 2018a it could present a better behavior for fluidization colonization and biofilm growth even at high loading rates also the spherical shape makes the carrier suitable to be effectively used in both aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation ismail et al 2018 sajjad et al 2020 since the spherical shape media proved to promote better use of the reactor effective volume some authors have proposed to replace kaldnes like carriers with less costly granules or pellets accinelli et al 2012 3 conclusion and future outlooks a wrong selection of such carrier geometry may prevent attached microbes at the core from accessing nutrients and indeed promote lower ammonia removal rates for instance a cylindrical shaped carrier having pores of less than 1 0 mm can accumulate biomass within the inner area of the carrier the biomass accumulation may drastically decrease the small pore space and limit mass diffusion resulting in low substrate and oxygen transport rates to the inner areas and eventually a low degrading efﬁciency also it presents a dense biofilm layer on the surface due to the accumulation of biofilm growth and increases clogging of the ﬁlter bed over time the clogged biofilms cannot be discharged and eventually dies due to the lack of substrate and oxygen supply the right selection of carrier geometry represents an excellent opportunity for the microbial organisms to attach on and assures more than 90 removal efficiency it is necessary to significantly prevent clogging and deliver a good mass transfer to the attached microorganisms this review study concludes that an ideal porous biofilm carrier undoubtedly has to be spherical shaped involving ridges on its surfaces and characterized by larger than 1 mm irregular pore size openings the irregular pore openings provide various environments to culture various cells and uneven biofilm and to retain the different sizes of cells and biomass so simultaneous biological processes can effectively take place e g simultaneous nitrification and denitrification larger than 1 mm pores size keep biofilm carriers providing sufficient space and proper environs for microorganisms to live and multiply which leads to sufficient mass transfer within the pores it can assist in retaining a large number of suspended cells and biomass however if too large pore openings have been used shear forces can easily remove most of the attached biofilms and delivering an unstable performance the spherical shape promotes the lowest dead sites and allows for easy diffusion than any other available shapes it can present a better simultaneous removal of chemical oxygen demand and nitrogen during a shorter duration in both aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation compared to other shapes besides ridges can result in the formation of much smaller thicker and complicated interspaces on the carrier surface in the case of entrapping an excess of biomass and developing dense biofilms shear forces can effectively remove it which keeps the biological processes of biofilms active and optimized inside the pores this ideal shape largely helps the studies to standardized biofilm carrier shapes and avoid the complex dynamics however having a spherical shaped carrier does not certainly provide hydrodynamic fluidization for suspended cells and biomass to reach deep internal spots future studies may optimize the internal voids of the spherical biofilm carrier to control biofilm thickness into the deep surfaces where all the voids have to be no less than 1 mm urgent studies are highly needed to assess the governance of pores that are larger than 1 mm on the rate of adsorption capacity also upcoming studies need to investigate the extent of cell leakage from large pore sizes towards finding the largest pore size to preserve effective biofilms the results of future studies can be used to optimize biofilm stability that is crucial for efficient wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest acknowledgment dr sajjad al amshawee

12019,shapes and pores of biofilm carriers play a major role in deciding fluidization efficiency biomass immobilization and removal efficiency however little is known about their impact on the efficiency of bioremediation this review study sheds light on the function of carrier geometry i e pores and shapes on the bioremediation productivity where the wrong selection of such carrier geometry may prevent attached microbes at the core from accessing nutrients it was found that the ideal porous biofilm carrier undoubtedly has to be spherically shaped with ridges on its surfaces and characterized by larger than 1 mm of irregular pore size openings the irregular pore openings provide various environments to culture various cells develop uneven biofilm and retain different sizes of cells and biomass the findings challenge current literature knowledge and commercial strategies that have chosen the surface area as the critical factor graphical abstract image 1 keywords carrier geometry surface pores bed clogging kaldnes corrugated surfaces 1 biofilm carriers in 1930 tausz and donath introduced the idea of using microorganisms to treat contaminated water giving rise to organics and inorganics biodegradation processes tausz and donath 1930 today bioremediation is a commonly used method for degrading transforming and chelating various toxic compounds driven by microorganisms by using toxic pollutants as a source of carbon and energy mosa et al 2016 al amshawee and kanthasamy 2018 as microorganisms attach to a solid surface and gradually grow biomass can be retained inside the reactor for a longer period of time to be thoroughly degraded contributing to stabilizing the reactor performance over a long period of operation zhang et al 2019 biofilm carriers have been presented to largely host microbes reduce the space needed and increase solid retention without the need for biomass recycling al amshawee et al 2020 the specifications of the biofilm carriers signiﬁcantly influence the sustainability of entrapped microorganisms determine the optimum thickness of the biofilm the growth of biomass and the removal rate of pollutants and accordingly have an impact on the reactor performance chang et al 2009 each piece of biofilm carriers serves as an effective hydrodynamic platform enhancing mass transfer and sustaining bioﬁlm growth they are the core of the attached growth bioreactors dalentoft and thulin 1997 they can result in the formation of a sheltered and stable bioﬁlm defending microbes from an alteration of process conditions e g influent characteristics and operating procedures it has been reported that the attached biomass i e biofilms on the carrier surfaces can be up to 500 times more resistant than suspended microorganisms in terms of survival mechanisms to sudden environmental variations e g ph temperatures salinity substrate type and concentration freedman et al 2017 biofilm carriers are commercially available as solid elements with different specs however the application of biofilm carriers has been associated with substantial complexity because of the large number of undecided specifications involving surface energy wettability compartment size pores surface area roughness and shape see table 1 they result in high variations in biofilm properties over time which leads to difficulties in performing repeatable biofilm studies for comparison lewandowski et al 2004 therefore studying the behavior of biofilm carriers in situ is challenging studies have concluded that the biofilm carrier performance cannot be predicted solely by finding biofilm mass and thickness young et al 2016 ahmad et al 2017 in fact significant removal efficiencies are largely dependent on a high number of pores rough surfaces and hydrodynamic shape which are considerable properties for the initial adhesion and growth of the bioﬁlm æsøy et al 1998 habouzit et al 2011 swain et al 2018 these specifications are able to govern the adsorption capacity and play a vital role in determining biofilm growth and diffusion of substrates and oxygen for instance the right selection of carrier shape can prevent clogging at high loading rates in contrast poor specifications of biofilm carrier may promote low permeability large ﬂow resistance and slow bioﬁlm growth krasňan et al 2016 however young et al 2016 and sonwani et al 2019 noticed very limited attention that has been given to the development of biofilm carrier specifications young et al 2016 sonwani et al 2019 therefore imperfections in the carrier design have largely affected the results of a large number of studies in terms of biofilm growth toughness and function dias et al 2018a morón lópez et al 2019 thus a backwash operation is frequently needed to remove the excess biofilm and control biofilm overgrowth so far there are no studies that solely investigated pores and shapes of biofilm carriers besides little is known about their impact on bioremediation efficiency therefore this review study for the first time defines the shape and surface pores of the biofilm carrier it systematically asks a fundamental question what is the best carrier shape and pore size to provide optimum performance in order to answer that it critically examines past studies that occurred to advance the specifications of biofilm carriers and eventually demonstrates a discussion to whether have or not a high extent of these specifications also it introduces new details that are expected to develop into a useful reference for media shape and pore optimization finally it places recommendations for future studies 2 geometry of biofilm carrier carrier geometry can inﬂuence bioﬁlm structure development resulting in a significant difference in the weight activity and composition of bioﬁlms it is highly correlated with mass transfer and hydraulic efficiency where the proper geometry can successfully provide the needed microenvironment for microbes adhesion and growth dias et al 2018b sajjad et al 2018 it is one of the key factors to increase the amount of attached biomass however various researches could not conclude the effect of geometry on carrier performance for instance li et al 2016 found that the influence of carrier geometry is still undefined for bioﬁlm growth and performance li et al 2016a this section sheds light on the function of carrier geometry involving pores and shapes on the bioremediation productivity where a wrong selection of such carrier geometry may prevent attached microbes at the core from accessing nutrients 2 1 pores pores as part of the biofilm carrier topography are of huge interest to increase surface area enhance initial biomass immobilization offer shelter to biofilm cultures from leakage and sloughing and protect them against crucial environmental situations sun et al 2019 during wastewater treatment maintaining an appropriately sized pore structure absolutely keep biofilm carriers providing an excellent environment for microbial attachment and evolution the pore structure within the carriers provides the necessary environs for simultaneous aerobic ammonium oxidation and anoxic denitriﬁcation chu et al 2014 so pores make biofilm carrier an ideal place to promote a firm growth and development of microbes e g polyurethane sponge carrier confocal laser scanning microscopy scanning electron microscopy fluorescence in situ hybridization atomic force microscopy or raman and brunauer emmett teller can be easily utilized to examine and verify the pore structure within the biofilm carrier ahmad et al 2017 chu and wang 2011a li et al 2012a cheng et al 2014 table 2 shows most of the pore sizes studied for a number of biofilm carriers 2 1 1 discussion of past studies used various pore sizes depth size and distribution of pores can define the type of colonized microbes rate of attachment development of bioﬁlm and swelling degree i e water holding capacity on the surface of a porous biofilm carrier sun et al 2019 alves et al 1999 during an experiment by díaz et al 2007 p fluorescens attachment was higher on a surface with 750 nm wide and 120 nm deep pores while no growth of the cells was observed on the nanometer amplitude 4 20 nm structure surface díaz et al 2007 other studies could develop pseudomonas aeruginosa inside the pores of the polyurethane sponge which largely improved the biodegradation process wan et al 2013 so far only motile bacteria were found at the pores bottom scheuerman et al 1998 fresh polyurethane biofilm carrier has many clear tiny pores i e large or small interstice space it provides interspaces for microorganisms to live and multiply and easily entrap biomass for their growth and maturation feng et al 2012 guo et al 2010 in 1990 fukuzaki et al assessed the influence of 20 30 40 and 50 ppi i e pores per linear inch pore size of polyurethane foam on microbial immobilization fukuzaki et al 1990 the smallest pore size of 50 ppi efficiently immobilized microbial cultures and generated a more densely packed biofilm even during 10 days of shaken conditions the smaller pores could rapidly and stably entrap suspended biomass of 95 while 20 ppi pore size retained only 20 biomass chen et al 2015 examined the impact of sponge pore sizes of 17 45 and 85 ppi on the start up stage in a moving bed bioﬁlm reactor chen et al 2015 the results revealed that the sponge pore size of 45 ppi produced the best performance where it delivered a high biomass concentration of 2136 6 mg l oxygen uptake rate for chemical oxygen demand of 150 1 mg h and oxygen uptake rate for nh4 n of 17 4 mg h therefore the test results of fukuzaki et al 1990 and chen et al 2015 are in agreement of 45 50 ppi pore size as the best possible volume for mass transfer other studies had taken further steps by using glass filter from whatman and duran with pore sizes of 1 0 μm 1 6 μm 2 7 μm 10 16 μm and 160 250 μm as growth surfaces to examine the efficiency of biofilm development inside these small pores pesciaroli et al 2013a fig 1 illustrates the influence of different pore openings on biomass immobilization słomińska et al 2013 preferred to use biofilm carriers composed of supermicropores of 0 7 2 0 nm rather than ultra micropores of 0 7 nm słomińska et al 2013 however feng et al 2015 found that nanopores lead to a reduction in bacterial adherence and much limit their development feng et al 2015 thus chu et al 2011 explained that the right pore size without doubt leads to sufficient mass transfer within the pores and thereby results in the fixation of nitrifiers and ammonium removal chu and wang 2011b however if by any chance of biofilm carriers with very small pore openings e g 1 1 5 nm have been applied it might drastically limit mass diffusion and result in worse substrate and oxygen transport rates to the inner areas ahmad et al 2017 díaz et al 2007 blakey and towler 1988 zhou et al 2008 and xu et al 2020 recommended large pores volume to facilitate the passage of water and bubbles promote the surface area for greater microbial growth and metabolic activities and finally allow a greater and quicker rate of mass transport blakey and towler 1988 zhou et al 2008 xu et al 2020 a study established a comparison between the performance of ceramic and polyurethane in terms of pores wan et al 2013 it proved that a lower degrading efﬁciency is a result of small pore sizes that are incapable of retaining an abundance of suspended cells and biomass wan et al 2013 it was assumed that the size of cells might be much larger than the pores which are greatly prevented from growing inside the small pores despite having evenly distributed internal cavities and enough pores to accommodate all the cells geng et al 2015 another comparative analysis reported by chu et al 2014 which investigated conventional and modified polyurethane biofilm carriers characterized by 280 880 μm and 560 680 μm pore size range respectively chu et al 2014 biofilm was more susceptible to attach to the modified polyurethane carrier than to conventional polyurethane carrier eventually the amount of biofilm attached to modified polyurethane carriers was 1 3 times more than that of conventional polyurethane carriers in contrast to fukuzaki et al 1990 the larger pores of modified polyurethane produced a more complex and diverse community of microbes tarjányi szikora et al 2013 concluded that less than 1 0 mm pore size can largely decrease and limit the penetration extent of oxygen and substrate concentration to the inner pores of biofilm carriers tarjányi szikora et al 2013 fig 2 presents microscopic images of polyurethane sponge and polyvinyl alcohol displaying their distribution and structure of pores pakshirajan et al 2009 randomly packed bed reactor with polyurethane foam having 0 6 0 8 mm average pore size to entrap phanerochaete chrysosporium for biosorption of copper and cadmium pakshirajan and swaminathan 2009 despite the great ability of polyurethane biofilm carrier it achieved maximum ranges of cadmium and copper removal of only 43 and 57 respectively which is greatly underperformance thus it proves the conclusion of tarjányi szikora et al 2013 not to use less than 1 0 mm pore size otherwise an inefficient operation will be presented feng et al 2012 applied polyurethane with larger pore sizes of 1 47 mm for the removal of organics and nitrogen in moving bed biofilm reactors feng et al 2012 it delivered a remarkable ammonium removal efficiency of 96 3 therefore an ideal biofilm carrier undoubtedly has to possess larger than 1 mm pore size openings in 2012 dalahmeh et al tested the same biofilm carrier of feng et al 2012 but with irregular pore openings ranging 1 0 1 6 mm for reducing pollutants from greywater dalahmeh et al 2012 it efficiently reduced chemical oxygen demand and total organic carbon concentrations of 890 130 mg l and 304 mg l to 37 9 mg l and 46 16 mg l respectively yuan et al 2013 decided to explore the performance of a broader range of 0 1 μm 2 mm pore diameter yuan et al 2013 likewise it highly removed chemical oxygen demand nh3 n total nitrogen and total phosphorus of 85 98 62 and 99 respectively in contrast ahmad et al 2017 sun et al 2019 and xu et al 2020 found a uniform pore size results in a stronger aggregation and evenly distributed biomass in the matrix ahmad et al 2017 sun et al 2019 xu et al 2020 other studies found the significant cells and biomass immobilization is due to having a higher number of pores which causes more substrate consumption sonwani et al 2019 studies have also compared different porous biofilm carriers in terms of efficiency for example chu et al 2011 established a comparison between polycaprolactone and polyurethane foam towards depositing numerous microorganisms in their pores chu and wang 2011b polycaprolactone entrapped much lower biomass and delivered a lower nitrification rate than the polyurethane it is because that polycaprolactone could deposit biomass only on its surface compared to polycaprolactone the polyurethane pores had higher rates of entrapped microorganisms as a result of the larger pores size which played a key role in enhancing the housing of microbial cultures and eventually produced a good performance in total organic carbon and ammonium removal besides nitrobacter was found in the interior pores of polyurethane cubes and even mass transfer remained active within the voids this proves that surface diffusion is the main mass transport mechanism of substrates and oxygen it also explains that the mitigation of dissolved oxygen is occurring to stimulate the heterotrophic denitrifying process in 2016 bassin et al examined the mutag biochip carrier which is made for developing a very thin layer of biomass on its surface and a considerable amount of solids inside its pores see fig 3 bassin et al 2016 most of the biomass was entrapped mainly inside the pores which consequently constructed a biofilm layer lower than 0 8 1 2 mm compared to kaldnes biofilm carriers that do not have surface pores mutag biochip carrier is way efficient in the sense of biofilm growth inside the pores and on the surface in 2014 qiao et al reported that the manufacturing of composites as biofilm carriers could possess a higher number and larger size of pores than unmodified biofilm carriers qiao et al 2014 meanwhile krasňan et al 2016 recommended altering the composition of the carrier material during the synthesis stage to enhance the pore size diameter and meet the demands krasňan et al 2016 for example at the time of a ceramic biofilm carrier was being fabricated a chemical reaction was implemented at the room temperature to produce the hydrogen gas muter et al 2017 it successfully left large pores after the solidification of a concentrated suspension of raw materials in a nutshell from all the studies discussed volume and dimensions of pores potentially appear able to govern the rate of the adsorption process onto the biofilm carrier thus it can be used in the near future to a certain extent to simulate and predict the performance of biofilm carriers 2 1 2 clogging of carrier pores the smaller the pore diameter is the less likely the entrapped biomass and cells are to be washed out of the matrix by influent ﬂow and shear forces however the small pores are the first to be clogged when a concentrated influent is applied or excessive biomass is accumulated the clogging easily decreases pore space to transmit nutrients reduces hydraulic conductivity and increases clogging of the ﬁlter bed over time dias et al 2018b kaushik et al 2015 for example when a biomass load was increased during an experiment conducted by toufaily et al 2013 it led to accumulation and excessive growth of bioﬁlm inside the pores and presented a dense biofilm layer on the surface toufaily et al 2013 variable pressure scanning electron microscope showed that the clogging was not uniformed across the pore spaces where some pores maintained their integrity and others were partially clogged young et al 2016 another study confirmed that by reporting that the biomass appeared in the form of dense agglomerates and not covering the whole pore space bassin et al 2016 above all the clogged pores certainly promote lower ammonia biodegradation rates and poor solids settlement on the other hand large pores provide more space for microbial immobilization and development and result in irregular surfaces of not so densely packed biofilms kim et al 2013 yang et al 2015 these surfaces are more open and structured with caverns compared to biofilm growth inside small pores however in a situation where the pores are significantly larger than the immobilized cells they might leak into the environment dzionek et al 2016 therefore the pore size should be sufficient to place microorganisms and to provide the required media inflow in the case of entrapping an excess of biomass and developing dense biofilms shear forces can effectively remove it which keeps the biological processes of biofilms active and optimized inside the pores despite that through an experiment of using sulfur lime porous ceramic carrier having 95 μm pore size inside two identical packed bed bioreactors for no3 n removal han et al 2012 found that the biomass was accumulated mainly because of the large pore size han and koo park 2012 then it blocked the mass transfer once all the biofilm was formed kumar and buitrón 2017 it is possibly due to the deep pores and not large pore opening that developed very tough biofilm layers so it could not promote mass transfer and not even balance the rate of growth to detachment despite the clogging of small and big pores richter and weaver 2003 considered clogging of the pore space is not a problem richter and weaver 2003 in sum this section finds utilizing larger pore opening than 1 mm can assist in retaining a large number of suspended cells and a great amount of biomass besides having a range of irregular pore sizes e g 1 1 5 mm definitely provides various environments which primarily helps to culture various cells and uneven biofilm so simultaneous biological processes can effectively take place e g simultaneous nitrification and denitrification however if too large pore openings have been used shear forces can easily remove most of the attached biofilms and deliver an unstable performance unfortunately due to the limited studies this review study could not determine the largest pore size future studies can consider an extended system of micropores like activated carbon as a perfect geometry to design and distribute pores on a biofilm carrier 2 2 shape the need for a good shape is necessary for an excellent mass transfer to attached microorganisms it plays an essential role in the operation of a bioreactor however it has to meet the essential requirements for achieving good treatment efficiency practical applicability operational simplicity and maximum removal of targeted contaminants tang et al 2017 also it has to retain a large amount of biomass in the system to improve the contact between developed biofilm and suspended contaminants to be degraded carriers have to be greatly shaped to develop uniformed biofilm structures and minimal diffusion limitations krasňan et al 2016 the use of correctly designed carriers represents a great opportunity for the microbial organisms to attach on and assures more than 90 removal efficiency which largely contributes to energy saving tang et al 2017 chernicharo et al 2015 most importantly the shape has to be suitable to be scaled up for use in industrial and municipal wastewater treatment plants despite the importance of carrier shape ødegaard et al 2000 found that the performance obtained with carriers of different shapes did not vary significantly ødegaard et al 2000 it could possibly due to the design of the biofilm process according to the volumetric removal rate therefore the researchers concluded that the shape of biofilm carriers is of less importance as long as the effective surface area is the same in 2003 rodgers and zhan agreed with ødegaard et al 2000 that the specific surface area of the biofilm carriers is the primary design parameter rodgers and zhan 2003 therefore the function and advantages of carrier shape have been largely neglected in favor of an increase in the surface area although following studies of hadjiev et al 2007 paul et al 2007 dias et al 2018 and morgan sagastume 2018 evidently disagreed with ødegaard et al 2000 and rodgers and zhan 2003 by demonstrating that the shape of biofilm carrier essentially determines the hydrodynamic conditions protects biofilms from abrasion and further influences the mass transfer of dissolved oxygen and nutrients dias et al 2018b hadjiev et al 2007 paul et al 2007 morgan sagastume 2018 alvarado lassman et al 2008 reported that the carrier shape is a major factor responsible for the differences in colonization alvarado lassman et al 2008 further ma et al 2009 proved that the shape is the driving force of the reactor performance ma et al 2009 studies still point out that the key parameter of the biofilm carrier is its shape therefore it is an important specification that has to be carefully designed for the optimization of bioreactor performance 2 2 1 shapes of biofilm carriers studies have immobilized microbes on porous and non porous media characterized by unique shapes e g irregular with cavities swain et al 2018 cylindrical with hollow duct al qodah et al 2019 su ungkavatin et al 2019 granular spherical sun et al 2019 flat chip mašić et al 2010 disc shaped geiger and rauch 2017 star shaped hlihor et al 2017 fibrous mccormick et al 2016 parabolic shape bassin et al 2016 ellipsoid shape luo et al 2016 cubic nguyen et al 2018 spindle shape tang et al 2017 o ring barwal and chaudhary 2015 hollow square spiral martín pascual et al 2012 to maximize the active bioﬁlm surface area these different shapes of biofilm carriers have been marketed under various names e g bayvitect buchtmann et al 1997 cosmoball ismail et al 2018 bioball masłoń and tomaszek 2015 kaldnes morgan sagastume 2018 aquacelt cu buchtmann et al 1997 extendosphere alvarado lassman et al 2008 snp zhou et al 2008 anoxkaldnes li et al 2016a aqwise abc5 martín pascual et al 2012 biocons martín pascual et al 2012 lentikats krasňan et al 2016 bioportz abu bakar et al 2018 most of the shapes have a hollow duct with a perforated structure to increase the active mass transport area zhou et al 2008 fig 4 presents most of the novel shapes of biofilm carriers most of the biofilm carriers launched in the market have maintained a cylindrical shape with a cross inside the cylinder and longitudinal fins on the outside for treating small amounts of wastewater e g household or hotel wastewater jing et al 2019 carriers designed with a cross structure in the center can increase the internal surface area of the carrier for microorganism attachment consequently innovated shapes from the original designs have been introduced regardless of its different names all biofilm carriers have common aspects that have been described in scientific literature and available in the market the flat shaped biofilm chip p was introduced to provide the right conditions for the transport of substrates into the biofilm mašić et al 2010 however it could be subjected to shear forces and attrition due to intensive contact with the surrounding liquid and other biofilm media bassin et al 2016 gjaltema et al 1997 and abigail and das 2015 reported that irregularly shaped biofilm carriers could offer more excellent protection for biofilms from liquid shear and turbulence as well as media collisions gjaltema et al 1997 abigail and das 2015 however it would not be practical to find the population of the microbes attached to the irregular surface in fact irregular shapes can take the developments of biofilm carriers to nowhere because it has no baseline theories and consequently leads to significant difficulties thus it greatly does not help to predict the behavior of carrier shape on the microbes cultivation and biodegradation rate in 2012 martín pascual et al observed a different organics removal after using aqwise abc5 kaldnes k1 and biocons biofilm carriers martín pascual et al 2012 biocons required higher hydraulic retention time to deliver similar organics removal of kaldnes k1 and aqwise abc5 carriers undoubtedly the physical and geometrical characteristics of each carrier and their hydraulic behavior are mainly responsible for the different results for some reason other studies considered kaldnes biofilm carriers the preferred design to provide a large surface area for the development of microbial biofilm accinelli et al 2012 ødegaard 2006 it is a cylindrical shaped carrier that has a protected surface area in its inner part which is not subjected to direct collision with other particles it possesses a negative characteristic of biomass accumulating within the inner area of the carrier bassin et al 2016 rauch 2014 the entrapped biomass found in the protected zone is loosely and much susceptible to detachment bassin et al 2016 this can explain the huge increase in the biofilm loss rate as the applied loading rate increases paul et al 2007 found kaldnes incapable of retaining small particles paul et al 2007 zinatizadeh and ghaytooli 2015 used ring form and kaldnes 3 for organic carbon and nitrogen removal from municipal wastewater through simultaneous nitrification and denitrification zinatizadeh and ghaytooli 2015 the ring form delivered higher total nitrogen removal efficiency than kaldnes 3 but the biofilm in the ring form was noticed less stable than that in the system with kaldnes 3 however due to the complexity and dynamics of biofilm carrier shapes pesciaroli et al 2013 found it challenging to sustain an even biofilm distribution into the deep surfaces and difficult in performing repeatable biofilm studies for comparison pesciaroli et al 2013b besides it is hard to extract general design criteria to standardize biofilm carrier shapes different shapes certainly develop biofilms characterized by different properties in connection with the hydrodynamic and mass transport differences imposed by the carrier design therefore there is a clear need for a better understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of the biofilm carrier shape for better prediction of performance and design 2 2 2 corrugated surfaces since the 90s researchers recommended biofilm carriers having ridges or edgy surfaces to increase the effective surface area where flat surfaces force bacteria and bioﬁlm to live as suspension gjaltema et al 1997 garcia et al 1995 müller 1998 rodgers 1999 so carriers can be crossflow corrugated with a corrugation angle of 30 45 or 60 to the horizontal or honeycombed with hexagonal vertical columns rodgers and zhan 2003 manariotis and grigoropoulos 2003 and kermani et al 2008 have employed corrugated carriers like kaldnes for organics and nutrients removal from wastewater manariotis and grigoropoulos 2003 gapes and keller 2009 studied natrix c10 10 and kaldnes k1 where both of the carriers have different internal ﬁn arrangements see fig 5 gapes and keller 2009 nguyen et al 2012 mao et al 2017 irankhah et al 2018 and jing et al 2019 used small cylinders as biofilm carrier which had crosses on the inside of the cylinder and fins on the outside nguyen et al 2012 mao et al 2017 irankhah et al 2018 jing et al 2019 others replaced disc shape carriers with corrugated cylinders to treat sewage tabraiz et al 2016 paul et al 2007 found that the biofilm was thicker between the nearest fins situated on the exterior side of the carrier paul et al 2007 based on further magnifications ahmad et al 2017 and zainab et al 2019 confirmed that the presence of a large number of microscopic ridges or cracks is suitable for further adhesion of anammox and denitrifiers communities which promote a stronger binding of microbial communities onto the carriers ahmad et al 2017 zainab et al 2019 besides ridges can result in the formation of much smaller thicker and complicated interspaces on the carrier surface 2 2 3 clogging of deficient shapes the interspaces of a carrier designed with small open voids are likely to be completely clogged as biofilm thickness increases see fig 6 thereby it does not allow efficient contact between the attached biofilm and the suspended biomass dias et al 2018b the clogged biofilms cannot be discharged and eventually dies due to the lack of substrate and oxygen supply hence a large number of studies noticed biofilm accumulation in the protected internal faces of cylindrical shaped carriers with nearly no bioﬁlm adhesion on the external surfaces see fig 6 dias et al 2018a pastorelli et al 1997 even larger and ﬂat shaped media are also aﬀected by clogging especially when used at high loading rates forrest et al 2016 it is all due to studies and manufacturers that have focused mainly on developing biofilms in the interior of the carriers and gave no attention to enhancing the exterior surfaces however other studies find the overloading is the main reason for the excessive biofilm accumulation at the internal surfaces zidan et al 2015 fiber bundles were proposed as a biofilter because it can sway with the flow which can largely prevent biological and physical fouling caused by biofilms overgrowth li et al 2016b therefore it can be employed for wastewater treatment involving a high organics concentration new carrier developments have to lead to the design of hydrodynamic carriers to prevent clogging significantly it has to widely consider wastewater solids level to promote maximum biofilm thickness control with a constantly exposed biofilm area technically simple in design spherical biofilm carriers are the greatest in terms of colonization rate it has the lowest dead sites less energy intensive even distribution of biofilm around the media less prone to clogging and allows for easy diffusion than any other available designs krasňan et al 2016 dias et al 2018a alvarado lassman et al 2008 it does present a better simultaneous removal of chemical oxygen demand and nitrogen and 70 lower biofilm detachment than the other shapes dias et al 2018a ma et al 2009 if aeration is used cylindrical shaped carriers promote higher detachment rate due to interaction with aeration during initial biofilm formation while the open spherical structure enhances initial biofilm formation and protects the biofilm from shear forces dias et al 2018a spherical shaped media reduce the amount of short circuiting while cylindrical shaped media reduces hydraulic efficiency dias et al 2018b dias et al 2018 achieved higher rates of ammonia removal and oxygen diffusion during a shorter duration using spherical shape media than cylindrical media dias et al 2018a it could present a better behavior for fluidization colonization and biofilm growth even at high loading rates also the spherical shape makes the carrier suitable to be effectively used in both aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation ismail et al 2018 sajjad et al 2020 since the spherical shape media proved to promote better use of the reactor effective volume some authors have proposed to replace kaldnes like carriers with less costly granules or pellets accinelli et al 2012 3 conclusion and future outlooks a wrong selection of such carrier geometry may prevent attached microbes at the core from accessing nutrients and indeed promote lower ammonia removal rates for instance a cylindrical shaped carrier having pores of less than 1 0 mm can accumulate biomass within the inner area of the carrier the biomass accumulation may drastically decrease the small pore space and limit mass diffusion resulting in low substrate and oxygen transport rates to the inner areas and eventually a low degrading efﬁciency also it presents a dense biofilm layer on the surface due to the accumulation of biofilm growth and increases clogging of the ﬁlter bed over time the clogged biofilms cannot be discharged and eventually dies due to the lack of substrate and oxygen supply the right selection of carrier geometry represents an excellent opportunity for the microbial organisms to attach on and assures more than 90 removal efficiency it is necessary to significantly prevent clogging and deliver a good mass transfer to the attached microorganisms this review study concludes that an ideal porous biofilm carrier undoubtedly has to be spherical shaped involving ridges on its surfaces and characterized by larger than 1 mm irregular pore size openings the irregular pore openings provide various environments to culture various cells and uneven biofilm and to retain the different sizes of cells and biomass so simultaneous biological processes can effectively take place e g simultaneous nitrification and denitrification larger than 1 mm pores size keep biofilm carriers providing sufficient space and proper environs for microorganisms to live and multiply which leads to sufficient mass transfer within the pores it can assist in retaining a large number of suspended cells and biomass however if too large pore openings have been used shear forces can easily remove most of the attached biofilms and delivering an unstable performance the spherical shape promotes the lowest dead sites and allows for easy diffusion than any other available shapes it can present a better simultaneous removal of chemical oxygen demand and nitrogen during a shorter duration in both aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation compared to other shapes besides ridges can result in the formation of much smaller thicker and complicated interspaces on the carrier surface in the case of entrapping an excess of biomass and developing dense biofilms shear forces can effectively remove it which keeps the biological processes of biofilms active and optimized inside the pores this ideal shape largely helps the studies to standardized biofilm carrier shapes and avoid the complex dynamics however having a spherical shaped carrier does not certainly provide hydrodynamic fluidization for suspended cells and biomass to reach deep internal spots future studies may optimize the internal voids of the spherical biofilm carrier to control biofilm thickness into the deep surfaces where all the voids have to be no less than 1 mm urgent studies are highly needed to assess the governance of pores that are larger than 1 mm on the rate of adsorption capacity also upcoming studies need to investigate the extent of cell leakage from large pore sizes towards finding the largest pore size to preserve effective biofilms the results of future studies can be used to optimize biofilm stability that is crucial for efficient wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest acknowledgment dr sajjad al amshawee
