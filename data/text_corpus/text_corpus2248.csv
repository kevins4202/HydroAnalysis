11240,paddy rice cultivation is an important source of global anthropogenic methane emissions drainage the flooded soils can reduce methane substantially but n2o emission occur concurrently which would offset the reduction of methane emission it remains unclear how mid season drainage affects the global warming potential gwp of ch4 and n2o emissions in this study a meta analysis was conducted to investigate the effect of mid season drainage on gwp and the factors that control the response of gwp to mid season drainage results showed that mid season drainage decreased ch4 emission by 52 while increased n2o emission by 242 the gwp under mid season drainage decreased by 47 compared to continuously flooding the yield scaled gwp under mid season drainage decreased by 48 mid season drainage had no effect on rice grain yield although soil drainage times and organic matter amendment are important factors affecting ch4 and n2o emissions in rice paddy field the study showed that neither of them had effect on the response of gwp to mid season drainage the reduction rate of the gwp under mid season drainage increased when n fertilization application rate increases from 50 kg ha 1 to 200 kg ha 1 this study demonstrated that ch4 is still a dominant greenhouse gas in rice paddies under water management with mid season drainage nitrogen fertilization is an important factor that regulates the response of gwp to mid season drainage high nitrogen fertilization rate would decrease the overall emission of ch4 and n2o under mid season drainage however increasing drainage times or applying organic fertilizer under mid season does not change the overall emission rate of ch4 and n2o keywords mid season drainage rice paddy water management methane nitrous oxide grain yield 1 introduction paddy rice cultivation is the second largest source of global anthropogenic methane emissions it was estimated that around 493 723 mt co2eq of ch4 were emitted in 2010 from rice field which accounts for 11 of the global methane emission smith et al 2014 methane in rice paddies is produced during the anaerobic decay of organic matter as the soils are flooded in most of the rice growing seasons although a great proportion of the produced methane was oxidized in the up soil layers there are still considerable amounts of methane emitted to the atmosphere to mitigate ch4 emission from paddy soils lots of strategies has been proposed mosier et al 1998 these strategies can be summarized as three aspects 1 nutrient management 2 cultural practices and new rice cultivars and 3 water management nutrient management includes reducing organic fertilizer application and chemical n fertilizer application it is well known that applying organic fertilizer to paddy soils such as crop straw returning could increase ch4 emission substantially yagi and minami 1990 linquist et al 2012a as more carbon are exposed to soil methanogens which produce ch4 therefore reducing the usage of organic fertilizers could mitigate ch4 emission however reducing organic fertilizer usage will prevent nutrients cycling to soils and consequently has negative impact on soil fertility and crop yield therefore it is not a priority to mitigate ch4 in rice paddies via reducing organic fertilizer usage fertilizer types may also influence ch4 emission from rice paddies linquist et al 2012a found that ammonium sulfate application could reduce ch4 by 40 compared with urea at the same nitrogen application rate because the added sulfate acts as a proton acceptor under strong anaerobic conditions which maintains soil redox potential above the level that required to produce ch4 hoehler et al 1994 scheller et al 2016 more recently jiang et al 2017 found that the higher yielding rice cultivars could reduce ch4 emission compared with the low yielding rice cultivars however the strategy can only be used in fertile soils as higher yielding rice cultivars can increase methane emission in low fertility soils jiang et al 2017 therefore this strategy is soil specific which limits its large scale implementation the only technique that reduces ch4 emission from rice paddies is to control water management such as draining the field or practicing water saving irrigation during rice growing season previous studies have shown that mid season drainage in rice paddies could decrease ch4 emission substantially sass et al 1992 yagi et al 1996 yan et al 2005 however when draining the paddy field another important greenhouse gas nitrous oxide n2o is produced and emitted concurrently akiyama et al 2005 nitrous oxide has greater global warming potential gwp than ch4 the gwp of n2o is 298 times of co2 equivalent which is significantly higher than ch4 25 times of co2 equivalent in 100 year time horizon forster et al 2007 therefore n2o emission from rice paddies cannot be negligible especially when the mid season drainage water management is practiced cai et al 1997 akiyama et al 2005 in china for example n2o emissions during rice growing season have increased from 9 6 gg n2o n per year in the 1950s to 32 3 gg n2o n in the 1990s zou et al 2009 the great increase in n2o emission is resulted from an increasing use of chemical nitrogne fertilizer and the shift of paddy field water management from continuously flooding to mid season drainage zou et al 2009 in the early 1990s scientists started to investigate the effect of mid season drainage on ch4 emission and had found that mid season drainage could decrease ch4 emission efficiently sass et al 1992 but very few monitored n2o emission simultaneously until the late 1990s scientists began to pay much closer attention on n2o emission from paddy fields that practiced with mid season drainage and its trade off effect with ch4 bronson et al 1997 cai et al 1997 and the number of papers on this topic were growing year by year however it remains unclear how much ch4 and n2o emission can be avoided if the water regime in rice paddy changed from continuously flooding to mid season drainage the global warming potential gwp co2 equivalent is used to represent the overall emission of ch4 and n2o for example bronson et al 1997 found mid season drainage reduced the gwp in paddy field with crop straw return whereas in paddy field without crop straw return mid season drainage increased the gwp this indicates that the response of gwp to mid season drainage is affected by organic material amendment in addition to organic material amendment other factors such as nitrogen fertilization rate field drainage times soil organic matter content may also influence the response of gwp to mid season drainage by changing ch4 or n2o emission as nitrogen fertilization promotes n2o emission and increasing nitrogen fertilization rate will increase n2o emission although the emission factor of n2o is nonlinear with nitrogen fertilization rate van lent et al 2015 increasing field drainage times will promote n2o emission while decrease ch4 emission qin et al 2010 it remains unclear how these factors affect the response of gwp to mid season drainage in rice paddies in this study a meta analysis was conducted to investigate the effect of mid season drainage on the gwp and rice yield in rice paddies we hypothesized that 1 mid season drainage would reduce ch4 emission but increase n2o emission while decrease the gwp and 2 the magnitude of gwp reduction to mid season drainage is regulated by field drainage times organic matter amendment and nitrogen fertilizer application rate more specifically the change of gwp is toward to zero if field drainage times increase because of decreased ch4 emission and increased n2o emission similarly increasing nitrogen fertilizer application rate under mid season drainage will increase the gwp by promoting n2o emission and organic matter amendment will decrease the gwp under mid season drainage 2 materials and methods 2 1 literature survey a literature survey of published articles was carried out via web of science google scholar and chinese magazine network the literature search was restricted to peer reviewed articles that were published before december 2017 while searching keywords used for the initial search included paddy field paddy soil rice paddy water management water regime mid season drainage and continuously flooding an exhaustive survey of the abstracts of these articles obtained was performed articles that meet the following criteria were included in the database first studies were conducted in flooded rice paddies under field condition the studies conduced in upland rice field were excluded from this study second studies reported results on a minimum of one of the following parameters ch4 emission n2o emission or grain yield for the studies reported ch4 or n2o emission gas measurement should be conduct under field conditions for an entire rice growing season the entire rice season refers to the period from rice transplanting to rice harvest the measurement of rice grain yield should be conducted by the end of rice harvest under field condition third the experimental design included continuous flooding without mid season drainage as a control and at least one mid season drainage as the treatment fourth n2o and ch4 emission measurement should be conducted at least once per month the studies measuring n2o and ch4 emission less once a month were excluded from this study to avoid missing some studies the reference list of the already obtained studies and two review papers shi et al 2010 sanchis et al 2012 was manually checked 2 2 dataset assembling for each study the means standard deviations standard errors and replicates of the control continuously flooding and treatment with mid season drainage plots were recorded for the studies reporting ch4 or n2o emissions the gas sampling frequency times per month was also recorded for the studies reported both ch4 and n2o emission the gpw was calculated and the yield scaled gwp was also calculated if rice grain yield was available the gwp of ch4 and n2o emission was calculated in units of co2 equivalents co2 eq over a 100 year horizon a radiative forcing potential relative to co2 of 298 was used for n2o and 25 for ch4 forster et al 2007 finally a total of 29 studies were included in this study with 70 pairs of ch4 measurements 45 pairs of n2o measurement 61 pairs of rice gain yield measurement 31 pairs of gwp and 28 pairs of yield scaled gwp in addition to the targeted variables ch4 n2o grain yield gwp and yield scaled gwp other basic information on the field experiment was also recorded the information included experimental site soil organic carbon content soc total nitrogen content tn field drainage times nitrogen fertilizer application rate and organic matter amendment rate 2 3 meta analysis processing an effect size of response ratio rr was used in this study to investigate the effect of mid season drainage on ghgs emission and rice grain production borenstein et al 2009 the rr was the ratio of grain yield ch4 emission n2o emission gwp or yield scaled gwp under mid season drainage rice paddies to that under continuously flooded to ensure the values fit normal distribution rr was transformed to natural logarithm lnrr when conducting the meta analysis eq 1 1 r r x t x c ln r r ln x t x c where xt is the mean value of the targeted variable under mid season drainage and xc is the mean value under continuously flooding the effect size lnrr of each data pair was weighted by the inverse of its variance for ch4 and n2o emission and gpw the effect size was weighted by standard deviation replication and greenhouse gases sampling frequency the weight was calculated by the following equation w 1 1 v 1 s t 2 n t f t x t 2 s c 2 n c f c x c 2 where st nt ft and xt are the standard deviation replication gases sampling frequency and mean of targeted variable under mid season drainage treatment respectively sc nc fc and xc are the values under continuously flooding treatment the gas sampling frequency was expressed as the number of flux measurements per month in order to avoiding extreme weights to the studies with high temporal sampling frequency all studies that measure more than 8 times per month were assigned the maximum value of 8 for rice grain yield and the yield scaled gwp the effect size lnrr was weighted by standard deviation and replication the weight was calculated by the following equation w 2 1 v 1 s t 2 n t x t 2 s c 2 n c x c 2 in this study the effect size lnrr and its variance v were calculated using metawin v 2 1 rosenberg et al 2000 by inputting the mean and the corresponding standard deviation and sample size of the mid season drainage and continuously flooded treatment when calculation the sample size of each study was its replication for grain yield and yield scaled gwp while for ch4 and n2o emission and gwp the sample size of each study was the product of replication and gas sampling frequency all the studies included in this study reported the replication of their experiment however some of the studies did not reported the variance of the mean values standard deviation or error under this condition the average coefficient of variation cv for each dataset was calculated and the missing values of standard deviation was assigned by multiplying the reported mean by the average cv and squaring the result liu et al 2013 a none categorical random effect model was used to calculated the overall effect of mid season drainage on ch4 n2o grain yield gwp or yield scaled gwp the overall effect size was considered significant if its 95 confidence interval did not overlap with zero a categorical random model was performed to access whether soil properties and field management practices affect the responses of grain yield ch4 and n2o emission gwp or yield scaled gwp to mid season drainage the studies were classified into different groups according to the values of a variable table 1 a q statistic was used to compare the means in different groups the null hypothesis was that the mean effect sizes between different groups were identical if the probability of the between group heterogeneity qb following a chi squared distribution was statistically significant p 0 05 the effect size was considered to be affected by the variable that be grouped 3 results 3 1 rice yield on average mid season drainage during rice growing season had no effect on rice yield compared to continuously flooding fig 1 however soc tn c n and n fertilizer application rate had significant effect on the response of rice yield to mid season drainage table 2 in soils with low soc level mid season drainage decreased rice yield by 11 7 compared to continuously flooding whereas it increased rice yield by 7 8 in soils with high levels of soc in soils with moderate soc level rice yield was not affected by mid season drainage similarly mid season drainage decreased rice yield in low levels of tn while it increased rice yield in high levels of tn a significant yield increase was observed in soils with c n in a range of 9 0 12 0 in soils received low amounts of n fertilizer 50 kg ha 1 mid season drainage significantly increased rice yield by 16 0 field drainage times and organic matter amendment rate did not affect the response of rice yield to mid season drainage 3 2 ch4 emission in general ch4 emission during rice growing season decreased by 52 4 under water management of mid season drainage compared to continuously flooding fig 2 the magnitude of ch4 reduction under mid season drainage was affected by field drainage times n fertilization rate and organic matter amendment rate table 2 in soils with 2 water drainage ch4 emission under mid season drainage was significantly lower than the one that drainage the soil only once in soils that received n fertilizer more than 50 kg n ha 1 the magnitude of ch4 emission reduction increased with increase in n application rate the magnitude of ch4 emission change tended to increase with the increase in organic matter amendment rate the concentration of soc and tn and c n did not affect the responses of ch4 emissions to mid season drainage 3 3 n2o emission overall mid season drainage increased n2o emission by 242 3 compared to continuously flooding fig 3 the magnitude of the effect sizes was affected by soc tn c n and n fertilization rate table 2 in soils with moderate levels of soc mid season drainage increased n2o by 421 7 which was significantly higher than the value in the high levels of soc 56 4 similarly mid season drainage increased n2o by 400 9 in soils with moderate levels of tn whereas it had no effect on n2o emission in high levels of tn compared to continuously flooding compared to continuously flooding mid season drainage increased n2o emission only in soils with c n ratio of 9 0 12 0 the magnitude of ch4 emission change increased with the increase in n fertilization rate drainage times and organic matter amendment rate had no effect on the response of n2o emission to mid season drainage 3 4 the overall emission of ch4 and n2o in order to access the net carbon dioxide emissions following mid season drainage the gwp and the yield scaled gwp were calculated mid season drainage decreased the gwp by 46 6 on average fig 4 soc and n fertilization rate had significant effect on the response of gwp to mid season drainage table 2 much more greenhouse gases emission co2 equivalent can be avoided in soils with moderate levels of soc than in soils with high levels of soc additionally in soils with n fertilizer application rate 50 kg n ha 1 the reduction rate of gwp tended to decrease with increasing n application rate for example gwp decreased by 54 6 in soils amended more than 200 kg n ha 1 whereas in soils with n application of 50 125 kg n ha 1 gwp decreased by 41 9 soil c n drainage times and organic matter application rate had no effect on the gwp similar to gwp mid season drainage also decreased the yield scaled gwp fig 5 soc and n fertilization rate had significant effect on the response of the yield scaled gwp to mid season drainage table 2 the yield scaled gwp in soils with high soc levels was significantly higher than the value in soils with moderate levels of soc the yield scaled gwp tended to decrease with increasing n application rate in soils with n fertilizer application rate 50 kg n ha 1 4 discussion in agreement with our first hypothesis the results of this meta analysis showed that mid season drainage during rice growing season could decrease ch4 while increase n2o emission greatly compared to continuously flooding the net carbon emissions co2 equivelant under mid season drainage also decreased significantly compared to continuously flooding because a small amount of n2o co2 equivelant was emitted compared to ch4 co2 equivelant in rice paddy field regardless of the soil is continuously flooded or drained linquist et al 2012b also found that draining the soils decreased the overall emission of ch4 and n2o therefore draining the paddy can be a means of reducing greenhouse gases emission in rice ecosystems however in contrast to our second hypothesis the magnitude of net carbon emissions was not affected by drainage times and organic matter amendment and it tended to decrease with the increase in n fertilization rate from 50 to more than 200 kg ha 1 soc was an important factor that regulated the response of net carbon emissions to mid season drainage 4 1 gwp to mid season drainage drainage times organic matter addition and n fertilization it has been well documented that soil water condition regulates ch4 and n2o emissions in rice paddies cai et al 1997 draining the paddy fields during rice growing season could reduce ch4 emission substantially because of the increase in soil redox potential methane is produced in a very strictly anaerobic environment with soil redox potential lower than 100 mv hou et al 2000 at the same time increase in soil redox potential promotes n2o emission substantially akiyama et al 2005 theoretically increasing drainage times during rice growth would result in less ch4 emission and much more n2o emission and the net carbon emission reduction would be toward to zero however results from this meta analysis showed that the net carbon emission was not affected by soil drainage times although more than once drainage decreased ch4 significantly fig 2 this is due to the unexpected response of n2o emission to mid season drainage times in contrast to previous study zou et al 2007 where they found that the water regime of flooding midseason drainage reflooding moist intermittent irrigation f d f m had significantly higher n2o emission factor than the water regime of flooding midseason drainage reflooding f d f zou et al 2007 suggested that n2o emission would increase when increase the drainage times during rice growing season results here showed that more than once soil drainage did not promote n2o emission this may be explained by the season emission patterns of n2o during rice growing season the n2o emission peak usually occurs during the drainage time of rice paddies for water regime with mid season drainage and very few n2o is emitted in the following days after drainage li et al 2011 for continuously flooding paddies field n2o emission peak occurs rightly after n fertilizer application johnson beebout et al 2009 or before rice harvest qin et al 2010 therefore more than once mid season drainage within the rice growth period did not affect n2o emission compared to drainage the field only once in contrast to our second hypothesis this meta analysis showed that organic matter addition had no effect on the responses of net greenhouse gas emission to mid season drainage organic matter addition does increase ch4 emission linquist et al 2012a because of the increase in organic substrates for methanogens however compared to no organic amendment ch4 emission with organic matter amendment decreased significantly under mid season drainage the interaction effect between water regime and organic matter amendment on ch4 emission had been clearly proved in previous study zou et al 2005 found that in paddy field with organic amendment mid season drainage decreased ch4 emission by 36 which was significantly lower than the value in paddy field without organic amendment 64 although mid season drainage increases n2o emission while the magnitude of incensement varied between organic matter amended field and no amended field in some studies the magnitude of incensement was significantly higher in organic matter amended fields than in no organic amended fields zou et al 2005 kim et al 2012 whereas in some studies the magnitude of incensement was significantly lower in organic matter amended fields than in no organic amended fields qin et al 2010 pandey et al 2014 therefore the effect of organic amendment on the net carbon emission of ch4 and n2o varied across studies and the overall effect was not pronounced in addition very few studies investigated the interaction effect between water regime and organic matter amendment on ch4 and n2o emission this limited our understanding the effect of organic matter amendment on net carbon emission response to mid season drainage therefore the overall emission of ch4 and n2o was not affect by organic matter amendment in agreement with our second hypothesis the response of both n2o and ch4 emission to mid season drainage were affected by n fertilizer application more specifically n fertilization promoted n2o emission and the increase rate of n2o emission under mid season drainage increased when n fertilization application rate increased from 50 kg ha 1 to 200 kg ha 1 the reduction rate of ch4 emission under mid season drainage increased when n fertilization application rate increased from 50 kg ha 1 to 200 kg ha 1 the overall emission of ch4 and n2o was changed correspondingly 4 2 yield response to mid season drainage soil properties vs field management generally mid season drainage has no effect on rice yield across the studies however in soils with high soc mid season drainage can increase rice grain yield significantly while in soils with low soc level mid season drainage decreased rice rain yield this is due to the increased decomposition of som during mid season drainage soils with high soc usually has high level of total n content because the relatively narrative c to n ratio the decomposition of soil organic matter releases a lot of nutrients to soils which could be taken up by the rice plant mid season drainage often occurs rightly after tillering stage when plants need more nutrients especially for n nutrition therefore the rice grows in high soc and tn soils has much higher grain yield following mid season drainage in soils with lower 50 kg ha 1 n fertilization rate we also found that mid season drainage increased rice grain yield due to increased decomposition of soil organic matter because these soils has lower n availability 5 conclusion this meta analysis showed that draining the paddy field during rice growing season is an effective way of mitigating greenhouse gases emission in rice ecosystem although mid season drainage caused significantly higher n2o emission this did not offset the reduction effect of ch4 emission consequently the global warming potential of ch4 and n2o under mid season drainage decreased significantly compared to continuously flooding nitrogen fertilization regulates the response of gwp to mid season drainage lower greenhouse gases emission rate can be expected under mid season drainage when nitrogen fertilization rate increases from 50 kg ha 1 to 200 kgha 1 however increasing drainage times or applying organic fertilizer under mid season does not change the overall emission rate of ch4

flooded treatment when calculation the sample size of each study was its replication for grain yield and yield scaled gwp while for ch4 and n2o emission and gwp the sample size of each study was the product of replication and gas sampling frequency all the studies included in this study reported the replication of their experiment however some of the studies did not reported the variance of the mean values standard deviation or error under this condition the average coefficient of variation cv for each dataset was calculated and the missing values of standard deviation was assigned by multiplying the reported mean by the average cv and squaring the result liu et al 2013 a none categorical random effect model was used to calculated the overall effect of mid season drainage on ch4 n2o grain yield gwp or yield scaled gwp the overall effect size was considered significant if its 95 confidence interval did not overlap with zero a categorical random model was performed to access whether soil properties and field management practices affect the responses of grain yield ch4 and n2o emission gwp or yield scaled gwp to mid season drainage the studies were classified into different groups according to the values of a variable table 1 a q statistic was used to compare the means in different groups the null hypothesis was that the mean effect sizes between different groups were identical if the probability of the between group heterogeneity qb following a chi squared distribution was statistically significant p 0 05 the effect size was considered to be affected by the variable that be grouped 3 results 3 1 rice yield on average mid season drainage during rice growing season had no effect on rice yield compared to continuously flooding fig 1 however soc tn c n and n fertilizer application rate had significant effect on the response of rice yield to mid season drainage table 2 in soils with low soc level mid season drainage decreased rice yield by 11 7 compared to continuously flooding whereas it increased rice yield by 7 8 in soils with high levels of soc in soils with moderate soc level rice yield was not affected by mid season drainage similarly mid season drainage decreased rice yield in low levels of tn while it increased rice yield in high levels of tn a significant yield increase was observed in soils with c n in a range of 9 0 12 0 in soils received low amounts of n fertilizer 50 kg ha 1 mid season drainage significantly increased rice yield by 16 0 field drainage times and organic matter amendment rate did not affect the response of rice yield to mid season drainage 3 2 ch4 emission in general ch4 emission during rice growing season decreased by 52 4 under water management of mid season drainage compared to continuously flooding fig 2 the magnitude of ch4 reduction under mid season drainage was affected by field drainage times n fertilization rate and organic matter amendment rate table 2 in soils with 2 water drainage ch4 emission under mid season drainage was significantly lower than the one that drainage the soil only once in soils that received n fertilizer more than 50 kg n ha 1 the magnitude of ch4 emission reduction increased with increase in n application rate the magnitude of ch4 emission change tended to increase with the increase in organic matter amendment rate the concentration of soc and tn and c n did not affect the responses of ch4 emissions to mid season drainage 3 3 n2o emission overall mid season drainage increased n2o emission by 242 3 compared to continuously flooding fig 3 the magnitude of the effect sizes was affected by soc tn c n and n fertilization rate table 2 in soils with moderate levels of soc mid season drainage increased n2o by 421 7 which was significantly higher than the value in the high levels of soc 56 4 similarly mid season drainage increased n2o by 400 9 in soils with moderate levels of tn whereas it had no effect on n2o emission in high levels of tn compared to continuously flooding compared to continuously flooding mid season drainage increased n2o emission only in soils with c n ratio of 9 0 12 0 the magnitude of ch4 emission change increased with the increase in n fertilization rate drainage times and organic matter amendment rate had no effect on the response of n2o emission to mid season drainage 3 4 the overall emission of ch4 and n2o in order to access the net carbon dioxide emissions following mid season drainage the gwp and the yield scaled gwp were calculated mid season drainage decreased the gwp by 46 6 on average fig 4 soc and n fertilization rate had significant effect on the response of gwp to mid season drainage table 2 much more greenhouse gases emission co2 equivalent can be avoided in soils with moderate levels of soc than in soils with high levels of soc additionally in soils with n fertilizer application rate 50 kg n ha 1 the reduction rate of gwp tended to decrease with increasing n application rate for example gwp decreased by 54 6 in soils amended more than 200 kg n ha 1 whereas in soils with n application of 50 125 kg n ha 1 gwp decreased by 41 9 soil c n drainage times and organic matter application rate had no effect on the gwp similar to gwp mid season drainage also decreased the yield scaled gwp fig 5 soc and n fertilization rate had significant effect on the response of the yield scaled gwp to mid season drainage table 2 the yield scaled gwp in soils with high soc levels was significantly higher than the value in soils with moderate levels of soc the yield scaled gwp tended to decrease with increasing n application rate in soils with n fertilizer application rate 50 kg n ha 1 4 discussion in agreement with our first hypothesis the results of this meta analysis showed that mid season drainage during rice growing season could decrease ch4 while increase n2o emission greatly compared to continuously flooding the net carbon emissions co2 equivelant under mid season drainage also decreased significantly compared to continuously flooding because a small amount of n2o co2 equivelant was emitted compared to ch4 co2 equivelant in rice paddy field regardless of the soil is continuously flooded or drained linquist et al 2012b also found that draining the soils decreased the overall emission of ch4 and n2o therefore draining the paddy can be a means of reducing greenhouse gases emission in rice ecosystems however in contrast to our second hypothesis the magnitude of net carbon emissions was not affected by drainage times and organic matter amendment and it tended to decrease with the increase in n fertilization rate from 50 to more than 200 kg ha 1 soc was an important factor that regulated the response of net carbon emissions to mid season drainage 4 1 gwp to mid season drainage drainage times organic matter addition and n fertilization it has been well documented that soil water condition regulates ch4 and n2o emissions in rice paddies cai et al 1997 draining the paddy fields during rice growing season could reduce ch4 emission substantially because of the increase in soil redox potential methane is produced in a very strictly anaerobic environment with soil redox potential lower than 100 mv hou et al 2000 at the same time increase in soil redox potential promotes n2o emission substantially akiyama et al 2005 theoretically increasing drainage times during rice growth would result in less ch4 emission and much more n2o emission and the net carbon emission reduction would be toward to zero however results from this meta analysis showed that the net carbon emission was not affected by soil drainage times although more than once drainage decreased ch4 significantly fig 2 this is due to the unexpected response of n2o emission to mid season drainage times in contrast to previous study zou et al 2007 where they found that the water regime of flooding midseason drainage reflooding moist intermittent irrigation f d f m had significantly higher n2o emission factor than the water regime of flooding midseason drainage reflooding f d f zou et al 2007 suggested that n2o emission would increase when increase the drainage times during rice growing season results here showed that more than once soil drainage did not promote n2o emission this may be explained by the season emission patterns of n2o during rice growing season the n2o emission peak usually occurs during the drainage time of rice paddies for water regime with mid season drainage and very few n2o is emitted in the following days after drainage li et al 2011 for continuously flooding paddies field n2o emission peak occurs rightly after n fertilizer application johnson beebout et al 2009 or before rice harvest qin et al 2010 therefore more than once mid season drainage within the rice growth period did not affect n2o emission compared to drainage the field only once in contrast to our second hypothesis this meta analysis showed that organic matter addition had no effect on the responses of net greenhouse gas emission to mid season drainage organic matter addition does increase ch4 emission linquist et al 2012a because of the increase in organic substrates for methanogens however compared to no organic amendment ch4 emission with organic matter amendment decreased significantly under mid season drainage the interaction effect between water regime and organic matter amendment on ch4 emission had been clearly proved in previous study zou et al 2005 found that in paddy field with organic amendment mid season drainage decreased ch4 emission by 36 which was significantly lower than the value in paddy field without organic amendment 64 although mid season drainage increases n2o emission while the magnitude of incensement varied between organic matter amended field and no amended field in some studies the magnitude of incensement was significantly higher in organic matter amended fields than in no organic amended fields zou et al 2005 kim et al 2012 whereas in some studies the magnitude of incensement was significantly lower in organic matter amended fields than in no organic amended fields qin et al 2010 pandey et al 2014 therefore the effect of organic amendment on the net carbon emission of ch4 and n2o varied across studies and the overall effect was not pronounced in addition very few studies investigated the interaction effect between water regime and organic matter amendment on ch4 and n2o emission this limited our understanding the effect of organic matter amendment on net carbon emission response to mid season drainage therefore the overall emission of ch4 and n2o was not affect by organic matter amendment in agreement with our second hypothesis the response of both n2o and ch4 emission to mid season drainage were affected by n fertilizer application more specifically n fertilization promoted n2o emission and the increase rate of n2o emission under mid season drainage increased when n fertilization application rate increased from 50 kg ha 1 to 200 kg ha 1 the reduction rate of ch4 emission under mid season drainage increased when n fertilization application rate increased from 50 kg ha 1 to 200 kg ha 1 the overall emission of ch4 and n2o was changed correspondingly 4 2 yield response to mid season drainage soil properties vs field management generally mid season drainage has no effect on rice yield across the studies however in soils with high soc mid season drainage can increase rice grain yield significantly while in soils with low soc level mid season drainage decreased rice rain yield this is due to the increased decomposition of som during mid season drainage soils with high soc usually has high level of total n content because the relatively narrative c to n ratio the decomposition of soil organic matter releases a lot of nutrients to soils which could be taken up by the rice plant mid season drainage often occurs rightly after tillering stage when plants need more nutrients especially for n nutrition therefore the rice grows in high soc and tn soils has much higher grain yield following mid season drainage in soils with lower 50 kg ha 1 n fertilization rate we also found that mid season drainage increased rice grain yield due to increased decomposition of soil organic matter because these soils has lower n availability 5 conclusion this meta analysis showed that draining the paddy field during rice growing season is an effective way of mitigating greenhouse gases emission in rice ecosystem although mid season drainage caused significantly higher n2o emission this did not offset the reduction effect of ch4 emission consequently the global warming potential of ch4 and n2o under mid season drainage decreased significantly compared to continuously flooding nitrogen fertilization regulates the response of gwp to mid season drainage lower greenhouse gases emission rate can be expected under mid season drainage when nitrogen fertilization rate increases from 50 kg ha 1 to 200 kgha 1 however increasing drainage times or applying organic fertilizer under mid season does not change the overall emission rate of ch4 and n2o declarations of interest none acknowledgements the work was financially supported by national natural science foundation of china grant numbers 41501310 and 41471193 and the ministry of

11241,this paper reports on the research techniques of application of multi criteria analysis mca for the placement of surface flow constructed wetland cw in the tile drained land it points out that such applications are quite rare for managing diffused pollution from agricultural catchments and conventional mca techniques have to account for advances of geographical information systems the objective of this paper was to present the methodology of mca procedure and to test its effectiveness for the selection of sites a case study is presented of the application of mca based on the electre method that resulted in solving two tasks 1 identification of the most pollution affected agricultural catchment out of three candidates as characterised by 14 relevant criteria and 2 placement of a pilot cw in the best site out of six in an intensively drained agricultural area as characterised by 19 criteria for both cases the criteria were clustered into three groups to select the most appropriate site for siting a cw soil related technically related and pollution related groups were identified based on a variety of numerical indices the sites were ranked a sensitivity analysis of the results when individual or group values of the weights are changed confirmed the robustness of the model it should be stressed that conventional mca is a powerful tool for selecting cw sites at a local level the research techniques described here may be a good reference for developing other wetland placement systems keywords tile drained lands constructed wetlands conventional multi

introduction in lithuania artificial drainage open ditches plus subsurface tile drains is a common agricultural practice the country area remains one of the most extensively drained in the world the drained land occupies 47 of the country s land area and 86 of the agricultural land area of which 87 is tile drained agricultural drainage has enabled radically improved soil cultivation and plant growth conditions povilaitis et al 2015 however land reclamation activities in the 1970s 1990s were associated with many changes in the local environment povilaitis et al 2011 taminskas et al 2012 among them a new undesirable phenomenon resulted in significant leaching of nutrients to surface waters via underground tile drain network deelstra et al 2014 these drains allow waters with concentrated nutrients to flow rapidly beneath the ground where it is free from uptake by the biologically active upper soil layers blann et al 2009 epa 1971 williams et al 2015 complying with the eu water framework directive wfd directive 2000 60 ec requirements to assure necessary environmental objectives river basin management plans were drawn up in lithuania among other important issues they designated surface water bodies at risk for which due to a failure to effectively manage diffused pollution a good state of these waterbodies will not be achieved by 2021 aaa 2018 a particular concern for these surface water bodies at risk is the high nutrient export from heavily used agricultural fields that affects the water quality at local and regional scales constructed wetlands cw acting as a buffer between tile drains and streams were first proposed during the late 1980s and later on developed as a suitable tool for removing nutrients babbar sebens et al 2013 kadlec 1995 kadlec and wallace 2008 kovacic et al 2000 vymazal 2017 they provide a means to bring back some of the lost capacity of agricultural catchments to retain water during high flow events erosion and nutrient transport constructed wetlands with free water surface disperse and slow down the inflowing water thus promoting settling and deposition of suspended particles these highly productive ecosystems process nutrients and provide the substrate for denitrification and nitrogen uptake by plants other important ecosystem services such as wildlife habitat and recreation are also provided however in lithuania and other eastern baltic countries they are only about to be introduced into the intensively used tile drained agricultural lands only one pilot scale wetland has been commissioned recently to protect surface waters from the diffuse pollution load due to agricultural activities aig 2015 the same situation prevails in latvia a few pilot scale cws have been initiated and recently constructed grinberga and lagzdins 2017 keep eu 2018 in contrast some 2138 wetlands for nutrient removal from agricultural drainage waters were commissioned in the period of 1996 to 2011 in sweden arheimer and pers 2017 following this example in the baltic states water and land management decision makers will be faced with the problem of identifying suitable locations for the creation of a system of cws water and land management decisions require considering multiple factors to do so many decision support systems dss have been developed daccache et al 2016 loucks and da costa 1991 multi criteria analysis mca also referred to as multi criteria decision analysis mcda or multiple criteria decision making mcdm is one of them to mention multi criteria analysis is a framework for ranking or scoring the overall performance of decision options against multiple objectives or criteria which are typically measured in different units it is a kind of a decision analysis technique mca has been widely used for water policy evaluation strategic planning and infrastructure selection hajkowicz and collins 2007 it provides a structured auditable and transparent tool that helps inform and add rigour to multi option decisions mcinnes et al 2016 structuring problems for mca has attracted increasing attention over the past 20 years from both a conceptual and a practical perspective this is reflected in the significant growth in the number of published applications which use a formal approach to problem structuring in combination with an analytic method for multi criteria analysis marttunen et al 2017 an integrated wetland research framework suggests that a combination of economic valuation integrated modelling stakeholder analysis and multi criteria evaluation can provide complementary insights into sustainable and welfare optimising wetland management and policy turner et al 2000 a decision support involving mca for integrated wetland management was proposed janssen et al 2005 three multi criteria approaches and a set of different weights were used to assess the conflicts and trade offs between environmental economic and social interests in a small agricultural basin with different land uses crops pastures forestry and soil and water conservation practices cisneros et al 2011 a new multi criteria ecosystems service value driven method to derive the optimal placement of restored wetlands in terms of maximising the selected ecosystem services which a wetland can provide or affect was presented in odgaard et al 2017 multi criteria methods for prioritising wetland restoration and creation sites based on ecological biophysical and socio economic factors with a particular focus on placement characteristics were analysed in darwiche criado et al 2017 there is a well established body of literature on gis and mca integration and description of techniques and applications for gis based multi criteria decision analysis ferretti 2011 malczewski 1999 2006 malczewski and rinner 2015 the so called spatial multicriteria analysis is different from conventional mca techniques due to inclusion of an explicit geographic component there are readily available methods for siting wetlands using gis tools dai et al 2016 kadlec et al 2000 palmeri and trepel 2002 recently a gis based approach for the siting of surface flow constructed wetlands at the catchment level was employed in lithuania dumbrauskas et al 2016 some 15 criteria used include elements of hydrographic network soil properties terrain features land use etc notwithstanding the above considerations related to gis the conventional multi criteria analysis techniques are still popular multiple mca tools have been successfully used for applications in the environmental field huang et al 2011 now 2018 from some 35 to 100 different mca methods are being counted worldwide saaty 2013 guarini et al 2018 but they are not sufficiently used for agricultural water management the literature review shows that selection of cws sites in agricultural areas based on multicriteria analysis is quite rare a critical review of mca methods in natural resource management is given in mendoza and martins 2006 and for water resource planning and management in hajkowicz and higgins 2008 the latter points out that a wide range of mca methods are being used paired comparison and outranking methods being most common it is most important to note that the application of different mca methods to the same problem results in similar rankings of environmental management alternatives huang et al 2011 it is beyond the scope of this paper to summarise all available mca and or mcda methodologies a state of the art review of mca including methodologies applications and software is given in greco et al 2016 the main aim of the present research was to present a practically innovative methodology using mca procedure for the selection of cw sites in tile drained agricultural catchments and to test this methodology but before it there was the need to identify the catchment most affected by agricultural pollution applying the same mca methodology to apply the necessary measures in the agricultural catchments they must be prioritised according to the severity of the pollution a simple well traceable methodology is needed to make these selections the specific objectives of this study were as follows to review the available best practices of the conventional multi criteria analysis for placement of wetlands and identify the most suitable method based on local conditions to test proposed mca method on the river catchments most affected by agricultural pollution to rank their relative severity to test this method for placing surface flow constructed wetland sites out of several candidate solutions to carry out a sensitivity analysis of the mca results and compare with the other alternative methods and draw conclusions 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study sites the three agricultural midland catchments to undertake mca procedure will be referred to as follows mūša id lt3410 a 5296 km2 nevėžis id lt1130 a 6140 km2 and šešupė id lt1150 a 4770 km2 fig 1 following the wfd technical terms directive 2000 60 ec these catchments should be denoted as sub basins attributed to the higher hierarchy river basin districts lielupe and nemunas respectively agriculture production is most intensively developed in the areas of these catchments data describing these catchments in terms of likely agricultural pollution and their physical properties were collected from a variety of sources including the river basin management plans published in 2010 and updated in 2016 aaa 2018 to rank these critical catchments according to the severity of the pollution 14 criteria clustered into 3 homogenous groups were proposed table 1 the groups are as follows physically related phy pollution related pol and technical related factors tec in addition the different plans or scenarios representing different hypothesis varying weighing groups were considered before proceeding with the mca procedure a number of potential locations of wetland sites were reviewed in the above described catchments and six most attractive sites were selected two for each of them for an in depth field study these potential sites to undertake mca are located on the regulated straightened and channelised first order streams receiving tile drainage systems and surface flow waters from surrounding agricultural areas sites for a potential wetland were selected in a regulated stream valley where drainage functioning is problematic due to frequent backwater of drains during wet season and cropping is hardly possible there for a general illustration only representative information for one potential wetland site in terespolis located in the nevėžis catchment is provided fig 2 this cw was made by expanding or more precisely excavating the stream channel banks details of the remaining 5 sites are given in aig 2015 this cw is located on the stabė stream the catchment is entirely tile drained the collectors diameters are between 7 5 and 25 cm and the average spacing of lateral drains ranges between 18 and 20 m with a depth range of 0 9 1 2 m the cw layout is similar to that presented in braskerud 2002 it was designed to act as a biofilter and or can remove a range of pollutants such as organic matter nutrients heavy metals from the water it consists of four main components a sedimentation basin deepest part 1 to 2 m b wetland filter c overflow zone and d outlet basin 0 2 to 0 7 m the hydraulic efficiency was increased by planted aquatic vegetation and water permeable low weirs made of local stones a total of 19 criteria representing 6 potential sites were used table 2 their short descriptions are also provided table 3 this pilot scale wetland is intended for intensive monitoring therefore the specific criteria like the proximity of water monitoring stations or likely presence nearby of other wetlands were included all criteria to be analysed were also clustered into 3 groups technical related factors tec characterise the physical properties of a site pollution related factors pol are those related to the chemical parameters or nutrients and soil related factors soil are those related to the properties of the soil economic factors related to wetland placement were considered in a general manner in this study only the land owner s likelihood of consenting to the development of a wetland on their own plot was taken into consideration the presence of any wetland in intensively used agricultural area is not always keenly accepted by the agricultural land owners darwiche criado et al 2017 many of them first of all private ones are not eager to see it in their cultivated areas therefore this fundamental criterion the consent of the owner was considered in the mca indeed it is the truly social criteria that do not fall in the above designated groups 2 2 multicriteria decision analysis mca methods the literature analysis reveals that there are many mca techniques and their number is still rising according to recent reviews lai et al 2008 huang et al 2011 marttunen et al 2017 vassoney et al 2017 some five to seven mca methods are most largely used by researchers and practitioners their groups are described below briefly 1 elementary linear additive methods the most popular of which are saw simple additive weighting hwang and yoon 1981 and ahp analytic hierarchy process saaty 1980 which can be applied when criteria are independent of each other and when uncertainty is not formally integrated into the mca structure 2 multi attribute utility theory maut or multiattribute value theory mavt keeney and raiffa 1993 a decision model that requires procedures to determine whether criteria are independent of each other or not 3 outranking methods the most known of which are electre roy 1968 1991 and promethee brans et al 1984 4 decision models based on fuzzy sets which have been developed to give a response to the imprecision bellman and zadeh 1970 5 other methods which include mca techniques not falling into the previous groups the core of mca is the construction of the so called 2 dimensional impact matrix the alternatives e g projects or actions and other dimensions or criteria by which the alternatives must be evaluated tables 1 and 2 concordance analysis is an mca cardinal technique which uses the quantitative properties of the input data it is based on ranking techniques for the effects of decision criteria related to a set of distinct alternative plans the method was originally developed in france in the 1960s when electre i which stands for elimination et choix traduisant la realitè was proposed by bernard roy and his colleagues roy 1991 figueira et al 2013 since their first appearance electre methods have been successfully applied in many areas including environment and water management criteria their number groups and weights were selected in such a way that they represent the object under investigation as objectively as possible taking into account mca experience greco et al 2016 the approach here proposed is the goals achievement method which includes a weighted summation technique where not only numerical weights are attached to the various criteria but also to their groups the solution of any mca problem via concordance analysis must be implemented through a series of successive steps ec dgtren 2000 figueira et al 2013 hajkowicz and higgins 2008 1 impact matrix 2 standardisation or normalisation 3 concordance and discordance sets 4 concordance and discordance matrices 5 concordance and discordance dominance indices 6 elimination and selection of alternatives and sensitivity analysis since most of the criteria to undertake mca have disparate and non commensurate units of measurement it was necessary to transform them into one common measurement unit from 0 to 1 the min max transformation which carries out a series of pairwise comparisons of the criterion scores was used the worst and best standardised or normalised values are 0 and 1 respectively these interim results are not provided here the basic approach of concordance analysis involves a pairwise comparison in terms of each criterion taken individually of all the alternative plans in the matrix from each comparison between two plans i and k we obtain a concordance set cik and a discordance set dik positive aspects of alternatives are considered by the concordance matrix and the concordance dominance index ci the concordance index of plan i with respect to plan k is equal to the sum of the weights attached to the criteria belonging to the concordance set of plan i with respect to plan k a positive value of ci reflects a dominance of plan i with respect to all other plans the dominance being stronger when ci is higher negative aspects of alternatives are reflected by the discordance matrix which measures the relative differences in the effects of two alternative plans four discordance dominance indices can be proposed as follows a simple discordance index di sd b weighted discordance indices di wd which takes into account relative weights c aggregate discordance indices di ad and d weighted aggregate discordance index di awd when their values are low i e a negative value 0 there is a stronger dominance by plan i in a similar way the remaining plans can be ranked in decreasing order of discordance dominance the global synthetic index gs i provides integrated information on positive and negative aspects of each plan it is calculated by algebraically combining the concordance dominance index c i and the weighted aggregate discordance index di awd this score always fulfils the condition gsi 0 and hence the final decision should favour those plans with gsi 0 a final preference ranking of the various alternatives is obtained by combining the results of the discordance and concordance approaches this is done by merging their partial score rankings most commonly the decision maker chooses the plan which has the highest average ranking in both the concordance and discordance dominance procedure the sensitivity analysis with regard to the input of information particularly the weighting schemes was carried out by doing so the robustness of the model was tested on individual values of the weights the multi criteria analysis was performed using the software package hypse based on the electre method mazzetto and bonera 2000 3 results and discussion 3 1 ranking catchments in terms of the severity of their agricultural diffuse pollution first of all it should be pointed out that this ranking does not produce values of agricultural pollutants but does indicate a relative comparison of pollution potential severity at a basin level and a reasonable base for additional in depth studies there were 14 criteria used for mca as shown in the evaluation matrix table 1 all criteria were to be maximised and their grouping was carried out as follows 1 physically related phy arable land river network density and so on 2 technically related tec drained area livestock units and so on and 3 pollution related pol total nitrogen bod7 and so on it is essential to underline that the above groups are only a basic suggestion as the user can subjectively assign a criterion to this or that group e g some technical aspects such as the livestock units could also be seen as belonging to the group of the pollution related factors moreover the weighing system is a subjective part of the input information trying to reproduce the personal priorities of the decision maker greco et al 2016 the global summary results of this ranking using the software package hypse are provided in table 4 the indices expressed by numerical values are briefly explained in the methodology part the following three plans which are shown in this table were considered basic plan rows a c implies the use of the same priorities for each criterion the individual criteria weights are equal 7 14 those of groups phy and pol are also the same with the exception of the tec group 35 7 35 7 and 28 6 respectively see table 1 plan high pollution rows d f approximately a double importance is assigned to the pollution related criteria the remaining weights of groups are diminished so that the balance will be kept 100 group weights are as follows pol 52 35 phy 26 47 and tec 21 18 as a result the weight of each individual criterion within the same group are pol 10 48 and phy and tec 5 29 respectively not provided here plan high technical rows g i approximately a 1 5 importance is assigned to the tec group 43 9 with the remaining groups both receiving 28 05 individual criteria within the tec group are doubled 10 97 when compared with all other criteria in the analysis each 5 61 not provided here for all the above given plans the ranked positions and indices clearly show that the nevėžis catchment is mostly dominated by agricultural activity that results in its being severely affected by diffused pollution its global synthetic index is the highest gs2 1 198 to 1 675 and very far from the others the second is the mūša catchment gs1 0 030 to 0 435 followed by the šešupė catchment which has the lowest value of this index gs3 1 176 to 1 645 positive aspects of alternatives are considered by the concordance dominance index ci in all the cases rows b e and h alternative 2 nevėžis proves to be most preferable with this index that is higher than all the others c2 0 739 to 0 995 conversely alternative 3 šešupė rows c f and i results in being the worst solution to be preferred having the lowest concordance dominance index c3 0 781 to 0 857 negative aspects of alternatives that reflect the relative discrepancy in the effects of two alternatives are expressed by four discordance dominance indices the more negative the value of their index the better the alternative in this sense the nevėžis catchment takes the highest position excluding one plan when among the other analysed alternatives it remains second di wd 0 006 the sensitivity analysis with regard to manipulating the weighting schemes proves the robustness of the results no important changes were observed in this test in the ranked positions excluding the above mentioned case in terms of the weighted discordance index row e the leader being the mūša catchment this mca clearly shows that the priority in applying best management practices for reducing agricultural pollution should be given to the nevėžis catchment 3 2 site prioritisation for the placement of constructed wetland notwithstanding the above fact that the nevėžis catchment is mostly affected by diffused pollution the multi criteria analysis involved all the catchments including mūša and šešupė this decision can be explained in the following ways on the one hand any catchment consists of micro or macro hydrographic units where local conditions for operating of a wetland play crucial role on the other hand the contributing area to a cw is relatively small from a few dozen ha up to several dozen km2 the latter means that the contributing area of a wetland and river drainage basin area is incomparable in terms of their magnitude they differ in order of at least hundred to thousand times six potential cw sites located in the abovementioned catchments and each described with a total of 19 criteria were used for the multicriteria analysis tables 2 and 3 most of the criteria were intended to be maximised 14 out of 19 and only 5 to be minimised the results of this analysis expressed by numerical values of the indices which were briefly explained in the methodology part are presented in table 5 a graphical illustration of the values of two key indices gsi and di awd is given in fig 3 the following four plans which are present in the table 5 were considered a basic plan the individual criterion weights are equal 5 26 5 27 the weights of the groups are similar pol and tec are 31 59 and 31 57 and a bit bigger for soil 36 84 this is detailed in table 3 b high pollution plan pol approximately a double importance assigned to the pollution related group 50 09 summation of the remaining weights of groups gives 100 soil 26 08 and tec 23 03 the individual weights of criteria within each group are more than two times bigger for pol i e 8 34 and equal for soil and tec groups 3 84 not provided here c high soil plan soil approximately a double importance assigned to the soil related group 50 21 for the other groups the balance is kept pol is 24 91 and tec is 24 88 the individual weights of criteria within each group are more than two times bigger for soil 7 18 and equal for tec and pol 4 15 not provided here d high technical plan tec approximately a double importance assigned to the technical related group 50 75 the weights of the other groups are 22 74 for pol and 26 51 for soil the individual weights of the criteria within each group are more than two times bigger for tec 8 46 and equal for the pol and soil groups 3 79 not provided here as can be seen from table 5 for all plans in terms of the index rankings the placement of wetland in the terespolis site is a top priority rows a2 to d2 then follows kamatis antanava and kamatėlė and the last positions are taken by the sites in jotija 1 and jotija 2 for almost all plans kamatis d3 is the second option except the one plan when the tec group weights are doubled conceding second rank to antanava d1 the latter almost everywhere dominates in 3rd place regarding the site in terespolis the global synthetic index gs2 is the highest for all plans including the basic one it is approximately 1 5 2 times bigger gs2 2 611 4 253 than that of the 2nd place site in kamatis gs3 1 656 2 029 this considerable gap in these values shows the high dominance of the site in terespolis according to this index the 3rd in the ranking is the site in antanava gs1 0 692 with a considerably lower value than the site in kamatis as shown above this happens in only one plan when the tec group weight is high d the site in antanava outperforms the site in kamatis however this difference in values is relatively slight gs1 1 468 and gs3 1 328 respectively positive aspects of alternatives are considered by the concordance dominance index ci in this regard for all the plans the site in terespolis is at the top c2 2 612 to 1 554 then follow the sites in kamatis c3 1 181 to 0 766 and antanava c1 1 088 to 0 222 the latter outperforms the previous one when the tec group weight is high d the last positions in the ranking are occupied by the sites in jotija 1 and jotija 2 in any case this index consistently follows the rankings of the gsi index four discordance dominance indices di sd di wd di ad di awd that determine the relative discrepancy in the effects of two alternative plans represent the negative aspects of the alternatives a low value of these indices i e a negative value implies a stronger dominance of plan i it can be clearly seen that these indices only slightly change the sites ranking if compared to the above considered analysis the importance of the index di wd is seen when group weights are increased especially for the tec group d there it is the site in antanava that is now ranked first d1 wd 1 994 followed by kamatis d3 wd 1 068 and terespolis d2 wd 0 764 the index di awd becomes more relevant when pol group weights are increased then the site in antanava cedes its dominance to the site in kamatėlė these results clearly indicate that the wetland site must be placed in terespolis the nevėžis catchment notwithstanding the fact that the concordance analysis is capable of taking into account a variety of information on diverse plans decision criteria and priorities it appears to be useful also to carry out a sensitivity analysis regarding the input of information particularly the weighing schemes the robustness of the model can be tested by means of sensitivity tests on individual or group values of the weights to perform such sensitivity analyses the criteria must be previously clustered into homogeneous groups higher level criteria here the case of three groups has been treated a graph exhibits the stability of the final ranked plans for the selected analysis index gsi fig 4 it can be noted that the terespolis site solution is ranked as the best solution for a great part of the triangular area top left i e this alternative for each weight combination has achieved the most favourable analysis index gsi with central coordinates as soil 38 pol 33 tec 29 then follows antanava site soil 12 pol 15 tec 74 the opposite top right is shown for the worst results of sites jotija 2 soil 36 pol 36 tec 28 and jotija 1 soil 7 pol 6 tec 86 plots at bottom illustrate in colour gradients values of the global synthetic index gsi on the left it is for the best site at terespolis and right jotija 2 site for which weight combination have achieved the least favourable analysis index a colour is linked to each result so that the situations associated to the different standpoint can be easily evaluated as a whole in a result the change in group weights did not alter significantly the rankings if one compares them with the basic plan when group weights are equal it proves that the site in terespolis nevėžis catchment is a top priority for constructing surface flow wetland 3 3 comparison with other mca methods all mca methods including those considered here have some generic shortcomings as well which can be briefly summarized as follows lai et al 2008 1 preferential independency preference for criteria is assumed to be independent of each other 2 double counting and undercounting over estimate or underestimate certain aspects when the chosen criteria are either redundant or not comprehensive 3 transparency of mca methods and results complex mca methods can be perceived by non expert as black box approaches one of the shortcomings of this study was its inability to account for socio economic factors cw location issue was solved without considering conflicting factors opinion of stakeholders that is a common case for any water development land use or ecological restoration project cisneros et al 2011 a clear priority in this study was attributed exceptionally to the environmentally related attributes it can be regarded as a specific one as here considered mca procedure allows to do so nowadays the increased awareness by public opinion and governments about sustainable water or any infrastructure project development started to involve with almost equal importance all the three interdependent pillars of sustainability i e economic development environmental protection and social justice and local community is now being recognized as a key stakeholder this research considered only one mca method out of briefly described above notably a classical outranking technique electre it is interesting to compare it with alternative mca techniques in terms of their effectiveness comparative studies of mca methods to water management problems have been made by many authors özelkan and duckstein 1996 eder et al 1997 a general finding from these studies is that no single mca technique is inherently better different mca methods were in strong agreement with high correlations amongst rankings hajkowicz and collins 2007 multiple mca tools including outranking methods have been successfully used for environmental applications huang et al 2011 they note that the mca approaches are somewhat similar enough and the differences in the choice of their application may be based more on familiarity and available opportunities than solely on the merits of the different methods themselves hajkowicz and higgins 2008 testing five mca techniques including outranking one promthee ii that belongs to the same group as to electre method applied to water resource planning and management came to conclusion that mca results do differ though typically only slightly under different ranking techniques this has implications on deciding where to focus effort when applying mca often it is far more important to focus effort on structuring the decision problem involving identifying decision options criteria and criteria weights than trying to decide which mca technique to apply the mca approach that was used in this research the decision problem criteria and their grouping and weights were clearly described the weights necessary to aggregate criteria within one objective are usually set using expert judgement however trade offs between objectives are usually politically motivated janssen et al 2005 this limitation was avoided by varying weights of criteria and their groups an alternative way to this approach would be to use the fuzzy set theory in order to handle uncertainty imprecision and vague information bellman and zadeh 1970 it is used as a tool that can be applied to any mca methodologies rather than as a specific mca methodology itself lai et al 2008 4 conclusions a conventional multi criteria analysis can be of a great help in selecting the most appropriate site for constructing surface flow wetlands in tile drained agricultural catchments and in achieving the maximum pollution reduction from agricultural sources the various indices presented here or in other multi criteria techniques are not intended to provide an automatic solution to the decision making problem the underlying presupposition is that this technique is an instrument for assisting decision makers faced with complex situations especially when the available data is hazy one of the main shortcomings of the considered here conventional mca methodology is its inability to account for the spatial attributes of cw sites to bridge this gap the synergies between gis techniques and multi criteria decision making tools should be more actively promoted for the placement of constructed wetlands even if the use of mca techniques is by now an established practice there are no specific methodology dealing with the exact procedures to be followed when selecting the mca method best suited to the contexts of cw site moreover as practical experience shows mca methods applied to the same problem results in similar rankings of environmental management alternatives acknowledgments this paper is based on the findings

11241,this paper reports on the research techniques of application of multi criteria analysis mca for the placement of surface flow constructed wetland cw in the tile drained land it points out that such applications are quite rare for managing diffused pollution from agricultural catchments and conventional mca techniques have to account for advances of geographical information systems the objective of this paper was to present the methodology of mca procedure and to test its effectiveness for the selection of sites a case study is presented of the application of mca based on the electre method that resulted in solving two tasks 1 identification of the most pollution affected agricultural catchment out of three candidates as characterised by 14 relevant criteria and 2 placement of a pilot cw in the best site out of six in an intensively drained agricultural area as characterised by 19 criteria for both cases the criteria were clustered into three groups to select the most appropriate site for siting a cw soil related technically related and pollution related groups were identified based on a variety of numerical indices the sites were ranked a sensitivity analysis of the results when individual or group values of the weights are changed confirmed the robustness of the model it should be stressed that conventional mca is a powerful tool for selecting cw sites at a local level the research techniques described here may be a good reference for developing other wetland placement systems keywords tile drained lands constructed wetlands conventional multi

introduction in lithuania artificial drainage open ditches plus subsurface tile drains is a common agricultural practice the country area remains one of the most extensively drained in the world the drained land occupies 47 of the country s land area and 86 of the agricultural land area of which 87 is tile drained agricultural drainage has enabled radically improved soil cultivation and plant growth conditions povilaitis et al 2015 however land reclamation activities in the 1970s 1990s were associated with many changes in the local environment povilaitis et al 2011 taminskas et al 2012 among them a new undesirable phenomenon resulted in significant leaching of nutrients to surface waters via underground tile drain network deelstra et al 2014 these drains allow waters with concentrated nutrients to flow rapidly beneath the ground where it is free from uptake by the biologically active upper soil layers blann et al 2009 epa 1971 williams et al 2015 complying with the eu water framework directive wfd directive 2000 60 ec requirements to assure necessary environmental objectives river basin management plans were drawn up in lithuania among other important issues they designated surface water bodies at risk for which due to a failure to effectively manage diffused pollution a good state of these waterbodies will not be achieved by 2021 aaa 2018 a particular concern for these surface water bodies at risk is the high nutrient export from heavily used agricultural fields that affects the water quality at local and regional scales constructed wetlands cw acting as a buffer between tile drains and streams were first proposed during the late 1980s and later on developed as a suitable tool for removing nutrients babbar sebens et al 2013 kadlec 1995 kadlec and wallace 2008 kovacic et al 2000 vymazal 2017 they provide a means to bring back some of the lost capacity of agricultural catchments to retain water during high flow events erosion and nutrient transport constructed wetlands with free water surface disperse and slow down the inflowing water thus promoting settling and deposition of suspended particles these highly productive ecosystems process nutrients and provide the substrate for denitrification and nitrogen uptake by plants other important ecosystem services such as wildlife habitat and recreation are also provided however in lithuania and other eastern baltic countries they are only about to be introduced into the intensively used tile drained agricultural lands only one pilot scale wetland has been commissioned recently to protect surface waters from the diffuse pollution load due to agricultural activities aig 2015 the same situation prevails in latvia a few pilot scale cws have been initiated and recently constructed grinberga and lagzdins 2017 keep eu 2018 in contrast some 2138 wetlands for nutrient removal from agricultural drainage waters were commissioned in the period of 1996 to 2011 in sweden arheimer and pers 2017 following this example in the baltic states water and land management decision makers will be faced with the problem of identifying suitable locations for the creation of a system of cws water and land management decisions require considering multiple factors to do so many decision support systems dss have been developed daccache et al 2016 loucks and da costa 1991 multi criteria analysis mca also referred to as multi criteria decision analysis mcda or multiple criteria decision making mcdm is one of them to mention multi criteria analysis is a framework for ranking or scoring the overall performance of decision options against multiple objectives or criteria which are typically measured in different units it is a kind of a decision analysis technique mca has been widely used for water policy evaluation strategic planning and infrastructure selection hajkowicz and collins 2007 it provides a structured auditable and transparent tool that helps inform and add rigour to multi option decisions mcinnes et al 2016 structuring problems for mca has attracted increasing attention over the past 20 years from both a conceptual and a practical perspective this is reflected in the significant growth in the number of published applications which use a formal approach to problem structuring in combination with an analytic method for multi criteria analysis marttunen et al 2017 an integrated wetland research framework suggests that a combination of economic valuation integrated modelling stakeholder analysis and multi criteria evaluation can provide complementary insights into sustainable and welfare optimising wetland management and policy turner et al 2000 a decision support involving mca for integrated wetland management was proposed janssen et al 2005 three multi criteria approaches and a set of different weights were used to assess the conflicts and trade offs between environmental economic and social interests in a small agricultural basin with different land uses crops pastures forestry and soil and water conservation practices cisneros et al 2011 a new multi criteria ecosystems service value driven method to derive the optimal placement of restored wetlands in terms of maximising the selected ecosystem services which a wetland can provide or affect was presented in odgaard et al 2017 multi criteria methods for prioritising wetland restoration and creation sites based on ecological biophysical and socio economic factors with a particular focus on placement characteristics were analysed in darwiche criado et al 2017 there is a well established body of literature on gis and mca integration and description of techniques and applications for gis based multi criteria decision analysis ferretti 2011 malczewski 1999 2006 malczewski and rinner 2015 the so called spatial multicriteria analysis is different from conventional mca techniques due to inclusion of an explicit geographic component there are readily available methods for siting wetlands using gis tools dai et al 2016 kadlec et al 2000 palmeri and trepel 2002 recently a gis based approach for the siting of surface flow constructed wetlands at the catchment level was employed in lithuania dumbrauskas et al 2016 some 15 criteria used include elements of hydrographic network soil properties terrain features land use etc notwithstanding the above considerations related to gis the conventional multi criteria analysis techniques are still popular multiple mca tools have been successfully used for applications in the environmental field huang et al 2011 now 2018 from some 35 to 100 different mca methods are being counted worldwide saaty 2013 guarini et al 2018 but they are not sufficiently used for agricultural water management the literature review shows that selection of cws sites in agricultural areas based on multicriteria analysis is quite rare a critical review of mca methods in natural resource management is given in mendoza and martins 2006 and for water resource planning and management in hajkowicz and higgins 2008 the latter points out that a wide range of mca methods are being used paired comparison and outranking methods being most common it is most important to note that the application of different mca methods to the same problem results in similar rankings of environmental management alternatives huang et al 2011 it is beyond the scope of this paper to summarise all available mca and or mcda methodologies a state of the art review of mca including methodologies applications and software is given in greco et al 2016 the main aim of the present research was to present a practically innovative methodology using mca procedure for the selection of cw sites in tile drained agricultural catchments and to test this methodology but before it there was the need to identify the catchment most affected by agricultural pollution applying the same mca methodology to apply the necessary measures in the agricultural catchments they must be prioritised according to the severity of the pollution a simple well traceable methodology is needed to make these selections the specific objectives of this study were as follows to review the available best practices of the conventional multi criteria analysis for placement of wetlands and identify the most suitable method based on local conditions to test proposed mca method on the river catchments most affected by agricultural pollution to rank their relative severity to test this method for placing surface flow constructed wetland sites out of several candidate solutions to carry out a sensitivity analysis of the mca results and compare with the other alternative methods and draw conclusions 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study sites the three agricultural midland catchments to undertake mca procedure will be referred to as follows mūša id lt3410 a 5296 km2 nevėžis id lt1130 a 6140 km2 and šešupė id lt1150 a 4770 km2 fig 1 following the wfd technical terms directive 2000 60 ec these catchments should be denoted as sub basins attributed to the higher hierarchy river basin districts lielupe and nemunas respectively agriculture production is most intensively developed in the areas of these catchments data describing these catchments in terms of likely agricultural pollution and their physical properties were collected from a variety of sources including the river basin management plans published in 2010 and updated in 2016 aaa 2018 to rank these critical catchments according to the severity of the pollution 14 criteria clustered into 3 homogenous groups were proposed table 1 the groups are as follows physically related phy pollution related pol and technical related factors tec in addition the different plans or scenarios representing different hypothesis varying weighing groups were considered before proceeding with the mca procedure a number of potential locations of wetland sites were reviewed in the above described catchments and six most attractive sites were selected two for each of them for an in depth field study these potential sites to undertake mca are located on the regulated straightened and channelised first order streams receiving tile drainage systems and surface flow waters from surrounding agricultural areas sites for a potential wetland were selected in a regulated stream valley where drainage functioning is problematic due to frequent backwater of drains during wet season and cropping is hardly possible there for a general illustration only representative information for one potential wetland site in terespolis located in the nevėžis catchment is provided fig 2 this cw was made by expanding or more precisely excavating the stream channel banks details of the remaining 5 sites are given in aig 2015 this cw is located on the stabė stream the catchment is entirely tile drained the collectors diameters are between 7 5 and 25 cm and the average spacing of lateral drains ranges between 18 and 20 m with a depth range of 0 9 1 2 m the cw layout is similar to that presented in braskerud 2002 it was designed to act as a biofilter and or can remove a range of pollutants such as organic matter nutrients heavy metals from the water it consists of four main components a sedimentation basin deepest part 1 to 2 m b wetland filter c overflow zone and d outlet basin 0 2 to 0 7 m the hydraulic efficiency was increased by planted aquatic vegetation and water permeable low weirs made of local stones a total of 19 criteria representing 6 potential sites were used table 2 their short descriptions are also provided table 3 this pilot scale wetland is intended for intensive monitoring therefore the specific criteria like the proximity of water monitoring stations or likely presence nearby of other wetlands were included all criteria to be analysed were also clustered into 3 groups technical related factors tec characterise the physical properties of a site pollution related factors pol are those related to the chemical parameters or nutrients and soil related factors soil are those related to the properties of the soil economic factors related to wetland placement were considered in a general manner in this study only the land owner s likelihood of consenting to the development of a wetland on their own plot was taken into consideration the presence of any wetland in intensively used agricultural area is not always keenly accepted by the agricultural land owners darwiche criado et al 2017 many of them first of all private ones are not eager to see it in their cultivated areas therefore this fundamental criterion the consent of the owner was considered in the mca indeed it is the truly social criteria that do not fall in the above designated groups 2 2 multicriteria decision analysis mca methods the literature analysis reveals that there are many mca techniques and their number is still rising according to recent reviews lai et al 2008 huang et al 2011 marttunen et al 2017 vassoney et al 2017 some five to seven mca methods are most largely used by researchers and practitioners their groups are described below briefly 1 elementary linear additive methods the most popular of which are saw simple additive weighting hwang and yoon 1981 and ahp analytic hierarchy process saaty 1980 which can be applied when criteria are independent of each other and when uncertainty is not formally integrated into the mca structure 2 multi attribute utility theory maut or multiattribute value theory mavt keeney and raiffa 1993 a decision model that requires procedures to determine whether criteria are independent of each other or not 3 outranking methods the most known of which are electre roy 1968 1991 and promethee brans et al 1984 4 decision models based on fuzzy sets which have been developed to give a response to the imprecision bellman and zadeh 1970 5 other methods which include mca techniques not falling into the previous groups the core of mca is the construction of the so called 2 dimensional impact matrix the alternatives e g projects or actions and other dimensions or criteria by which the alternatives must be evaluated tables 1 and 2 concordance analysis is an mca cardinal technique which uses the quantitative properties of the input data it is based on ranking techniques for the effects of decision criteria related to a set of distinct alternative plans the method was originally developed in france in the 1960s when electre i which stands for elimination et choix traduisant la realitè was proposed by bernard roy and his colleagues roy 1991 figueira et al 2013 since their first appearance electre methods have been successfully applied in many areas including environment and water management criteria their number groups and weights were selected in such a way that they represent the object under investigation as objectively as possible taking into account mca experience greco et al 2016 the approach here proposed is the goals achievement method which includes a weighted summation technique where not only numerical weights are attached to the various criteria but also to their groups the solution of any mca problem via concordance analysis must be implemented through a series of successive steps ec dgtren 2000 figueira et al 2013 hajkowicz and higgins 2008 1 impact matrix 2 standardisation or normalisation 3 concordance and discordance sets 4 concordance and discordance matrices 5 concordance and discordance dominance indices 6 elimination and selection of alternatives and sensitivity analysis since most of the criteria to undertake mca have disparate and non commensurate units of measurement it was necessary to transform them into one common measurement unit from 0 to 1 the min max transformation which carries out a series of pairwise comparisons of the criterion scores was used the worst and best standardised or normalised values are 0 and 1 respectively these interim results are not provided here the basic approach of concordance analysis involves a pairwise comparison in terms of each criterion taken individually of all the alternative plans in the matrix from each comparison between two plans i and k we obtain a concordance set cik and a discordance set dik positive aspects of alternatives are considered by the concordance matrix and the concordance dominance index ci the concordance index of plan i with respect to plan k is equal to the sum of the weights attached to the criteria belonging to the concordance set of plan i with respect to plan k a positive value of ci reflects a dominance of plan i with respect to all other plans the dominance being stronger when ci is higher negative aspects of alternatives are reflected by the discordance matrix which measures the relative differences in the effects of two alternative plans four discordance dominance indices can be proposed as follows a simple discordance index di sd b weighted discordance indices di wd which takes into account relative weights c aggregate discordance indices di ad and d weighted aggregate discordance index di awd when their values are low i e a negative value 0 there is a stronger dominance by plan i in a similar way the remaining plans can be ranked in decreasing order of discordance dominance the global synthetic index gs i provides integrated information on positive and negative aspects of each plan it is calculated by algebraically combining the concordance dominance index c i and the weighted aggregate discordance index di awd this score always fulfils the condition gsi 0 and hence the final decision should favour those plans with gsi 0 a final preference ranking of the various alternatives is obtained by combining the results of the discordance and concordance approaches this is done by merging their partial score rankings most commonly the decision maker chooses the plan which has the highest average ranking in both the concordance and discordance dominance procedure the sensitivity analysis with regard to the input of information particularly the weighting schemes was carried out by doing so the robustness of the model was tested on individual values of the weights the multi criteria analysis was performed using the software package hypse based on the electre method mazzetto and bonera 2000 3 results and discussion 3 1 ranking catchments in terms of the severity of their agricultural diffuse pollution first of all it should be pointed out that this ranking does not produce values of agricultural pollutants but does indicate a relative comparison of pollution potential severity at a basin level and a reasonable base for additional in depth studies there were 14 criteria used for mca as shown in the evaluation matrix table 1 all criteria were to be maximised and their grouping was carried out as follows 1 physically related phy arable land river network density and so on 2 technically related tec drained area livestock units and so on and 3 pollution related pol total nitrogen bod7 and so on it is essential to underline that the above groups are only a basic suggestion as the user can subjectively assign a criterion to this or that group e g some technical aspects such as the livestock units could also be seen as belonging to the group of the pollution related factors moreover the weighing system is a subjective part of the input information trying to reproduce the personal priorities of the decision maker greco et al 2016 the global summary results of this ranking using the software package hypse are provided in table 4 the indices expressed by numerical values are briefly explained in the methodology part the following three plans which are shown in this table were considered basic plan rows a c implies the use of the same priorities for each criterion the individual criteria weights are equal 7 14 those of groups phy and pol are also the same with the exception of the tec group 35 7 35 7 and 28 6 respectively see table 1 plan high pollution rows d f approximately a double importance is assigned to the pollution related criteria the remaining weights of groups are diminished so that the balance will be kept 100 group weights are as follows pol 52 35 phy 26 47 and tec 21 18 as a result the weight of each individual criterion within the same group are pol 10 48 and phy and tec 5 29 respectively not provided here plan high technical rows g i approximately a 1 5 importance is assigned to the tec group 43 9 with the remaining groups both receiving 28 05 individual criteria within the tec group are doubled 10 97 when compared with all other criteria in the analysis each 5 61 not provided here for all the above given plans the ranked positions and indices clearly show that the nevėžis catchment is mostly dominated by agricultural activity that results in its being severely affected by diffused pollution its global synthetic index is the highest gs2 1 198 to 1 675 and very far from the others the second is the mūša catchment gs1 0 030 to 0 435 followed by the šešupė catchment which has the lowest value of this index gs3 1 176 to 1 645 positive aspects of alternatives are considered by the concordance dominance index ci in all the cases rows b e and h alternative 2 nevėžis proves to be most preferable with this index that is higher than all the others c2 0 739 to 0 995 conversely alternative 3 šešupė rows c f and i results in being the worst solution to be preferred having the lowest concordance dominance index c3 0 781 to 0 857 negative aspects of alternatives that reflect the relative discrepancy in the effects of two alternatives are expressed by four discordance dominance indices the more negative the value of their index the better the alternative in this sense the nevėžis catchment takes the highest position excluding one plan when among the other analysed alternatives it remains second di wd 0 006 the sensitivity analysis with regard to manipulating the weighting schemes proves the robustness of the results no important changes were observed in this test in the ranked positions excluding the above mentioned case in terms of the weighted discordance index row e the leader being the mūša catchment this mca clearly shows that the priority in applying best management practices for reducing agricultural pollution should be given to the nevėžis catchment 3 2 site prioritisation for the placement of constructed wetland notwithstanding the above fact that the nevėžis catchment is mostly affected by diffused pollution the multi criteria analysis involved all the catchments including mūša and šešupė this decision can be explained in the following ways on the one hand any catchment consists of micro or macro hydrographic units where local conditions for operating of a wetland play crucial role on the other hand the contributing area to a cw is relatively small from a few dozen ha up to several dozen km2 the latter means that the contributing area of a wetland and river drainage basin area is incomparable in terms of their magnitude they differ in order of at least hundred to thousand times six potential cw sites located in the abovementioned catchments and each described with a total of 19 criteria were used for the multicriteria analysis tables 2 and 3 most of the criteria were intended to be maximised 14 out of 19 and only 5 to be minimised the results of this analysis expressed by numerical values of the indices which were briefly explained in the methodology part are presented in table 5 a graphical illustration of the values of two key indices gsi and di awd is given in fig 3 the following four plans which are present in the table 5 were considered a basic plan the individual criterion weights are equal 5 26 5 27 the weights of the groups are similar pol and tec are 31 59 and 31 57 and a bit bigger for soil 36 84 this is detailed in table 3 b high pollution plan pol approximately a double importance assigned to the pollution related group 50 09 summation of the remaining weights of groups gives 100 soil 26 08 and tec 23 03 the individual weights of criteria within each group are more than two times bigger for pol i e 8 34 and equal for soil and tec groups 3 84 not provided here c high soil plan soil approximately a double importance assigned to the soil related group 50 21 for the other groups the balance is kept pol is 24 91 and tec is 24 88 the individual weights of criteria within each group are more than two times bigger for soil 7 18 and equal for tec and pol 4 15 not provided here d high technical plan tec approximately a double importance assigned to the technical related group 50 75 the weights of the other groups are 22 74 for pol and 26 51 for soil the individual weights of the criteria within each group are more than two times bigger for tec 8 46 and equal for the pol and soil groups 3 79 not provided here as can be seen from table 5 for all plans in terms of the index rankings the placement of wetland in the terespolis site is a top priority rows a2 to d2 then follows kamatis antanava and kamatėlė and the last positions are taken by the sites in jotija 1 and jotija 2 for almost all plans kamatis d3 is the second option except the one plan when the tec group weights are doubled conceding second rank to antanava d1 the latter almost everywhere dominates in 3rd place regarding the site in terespolis the global synthetic index gs2 is the highest for all plans including the basic one it is approximately 1 5 2 times bigger gs2 2 611 4 253 than that of the 2nd place site in kamatis gs3 1 656 2 029 this considerable gap in these values shows the high dominance of the site in terespolis according to this index the 3rd in the ranking is the site in antanava gs1 0 692 with a considerably lower value than the site in kamatis as shown above this happens in only one plan when the tec group weight is high d the site in antanava outperforms the site in kamatis however this difference in values is relatively slight gs1 1 468 and gs3 1 328 respectively positive aspects of alternatives are considered by the concordance dominance index ci in this regard for all the plans the site in terespolis is at the top c2 2 612 to 1 554 then follow the sites in kamatis c3 1 181 to 0 766 and antanava c1 1 088 to 0 222 the latter outperforms the previous one when the tec group weight is high d the last positions in the ranking are occupied by the sites in jotija 1 and jotija 2 in any case this index consistently follows the rankings of the gsi index four discordance dominance indices di sd di wd di ad di awd that determine the relative discrepancy in the effects of two alternative plans represent the negative aspects of the alternatives a low value of these indices i e a negative value implies a stronger dominance of plan i it can be clearly seen that these indices only slightly change the sites ranking if compared to the above considered analysis the importance of the index di wd is seen when group weights are increased especially for the tec group d there it is the site in antanava that is now ranked first d1 wd 1 994 followed by kamatis d3 wd 1 068 and terespolis d2 wd 0 764 the index di awd becomes more relevant when pol group weights are increased then the site in antanava cedes its dominance to the site in kamatėlė these results clearly indicate that the wetland site must be placed in terespolis the nevėžis catchment notwithstanding the fact that the concordance analysis is capable of taking into account a variety of information on diverse plans decision criteria and priorities it appears to be useful also to carry out a sensitivity analysis regarding the input of information particularly the weighing schemes the robustness of the model can be tested by means of sensitivity tests on individual or group values of the weights to perform such sensitivity analyses the criteria must be previously clustered into homogeneous groups higher level criteria here the case of three groups has been treated a graph exhibits the stability of the final ranked plans for the selected analysis index gsi fig 4 it can be noted that the terespolis site solution is ranked as the best solution for a great part of the triangular area top left i e this alternative for each weight combination has achieved the most favourable analysis index gsi with central coordinates as soil 38 pol 33 tec 29 then follows antanava site soil 12 pol 15 tec 74 the opposite top right is shown for the worst results of sites jotija 2 soil 36 pol 36 tec 28 and jotija 1 soil 7 pol 6 tec 86 plots at bottom illustrate in colour gradients values of the global synthetic index gsi on the left it is for the best site at terespolis and right jotija 2 site for which weight combination have achieved the least favourable analysis index a colour is linked to each result so that the situations associated to the different standpoint can be easily evaluated as a whole in a result the change in group weights did not alter significantly the rankings if one compares them with the basic plan when group weights are equal it proves that the site in terespolis nevėžis catchment is a top priority for constructing surface flow wetland 3 3 comparison with other mca methods all mca methods including those considered here have some generic shortcomings as well which can be briefly summarized as follows lai et al 2008 1 preferential independency preference for criteria is assumed to be independent of each other 2 double counting and undercounting over estimate or underestimate certain aspects when the chosen criteria are either redundant or not comprehensive 3 transparency of mca methods and results complex mca methods can be perceived by non expert as black box approaches one of the shortcomings of this study was its inability to account for socio economic factors cw location issue was solved without considering conflicting factors opinion of stakeholders that is a common case for any water development land use or ecological restoration project cisneros et al 2011 a clear priority in this study was attributed exceptionally to the environmentally related attributes it can be regarded as a specific one as here considered mca procedure allows to do so nowadays the increased awareness by public opinion and governments about sustainable water or any infrastructure project development started to involve with almost equal importance all the three interdependent pillars of sustainability i e economic development environmental protection and social justice and local community is now being recognized as a key stakeholder this research considered only one mca method out of briefly described above notably a classical outranking technique electre it is interesting to compare it with alternative mca techniques in terms of their effectiveness comparative studies of mca methods to water management problems have been made by many authors özelkan and duckstein 1996 eder et al 1997 a general finding from these studies is that no single mca technique is inherently better different mca methods were in strong agreement with high correlations amongst rankings hajkowicz and collins 2007 multiple mca tools including outranking methods have been successfully used for environmental applications huang et al 2011 they note that the mca approaches are somewhat similar enough and the differences in the choice of their application may be based more on familiarity and available opportunities than solely on the merits of the different methods themselves hajkowicz and higgins 2008 testing five mca techniques including outranking one promthee ii that belongs to the same group as to electre method applied to water resource planning and management came to conclusion that mca results do differ though typically only slightly under different ranking techniques this has implications on deciding where to focus effort when applying mca often it is far more important to focus effort on structuring the decision problem involving identifying decision options criteria and criteria weights than trying to decide which mca technique to apply the mca approach that was used in this research the decision problem criteria and their grouping and weights were clearly described the weights necessary to aggregate criteria within one objective are usually set using expert judgement however trade offs between objectives are usually politically motivated janssen et al 2005 this limitation was avoided by varying weights of criteria and their groups an alternative way to this approach would be to use the fuzzy set theory in order to handle uncertainty imprecision and vague information bellman and zadeh 1970 it is used as a tool that can be applied to any mca methodologies rather than as a specific mca methodology itself lai et al 2008 4 conclusions a conventional multi criteria analysis can be of a great help in selecting the most appropriate site for constructing surface flow wetlands in tile drained agricultural catchments and in achieving the maximum pollution reduction from agricultural sources the various indices presented here or in other multi criteria techniques are not intended to provide an automatic solution to the decision making problem the underlying presupposition is that this technique is an instrument for assisting decision makers faced with complex situations especially when the available data is hazy one of the main shortcomings of the considered here conventional mca methodology is its inability to account for the spatial attributes of cw sites to bridge this gap the synergies between gis techniques and multi criteria decision making tools should be more actively promoted for the placement of constructed wetlands even if the use of mca techniques is by now an established practice there are no specific methodology dealing with the exact procedures to be followed when selecting the mca method best suited to the contexts of cw site moreover as practical experience shows mca methods applied to the same problem results in similar rankings of environmental management alternatives acknowledgments this paper is based on the findings

11242,in order to achieve optimum yields in oil palm management practices should be tailored to the crop site agro ecological conditions nevertheless oil palm farmers often have to make decisions based on a limited knowledge base considering that water management is a critical aspect of oil palm crops this paper describes an inference method for irrigation decision making in oil palm supported on soil moisture and vapor pressure deficit data under an ideal scenario where this agrometeorological data is available through a wireless sensor network wsn at a crop plot resolution we formulated a method to prevent oil palm farmers to submit their crops to water deficit stress the inference method was based on a data fusion technique called dempster shafer inference which is convenient for the use of uncertain data with distinct levels of detail such as those present in a wsn the outcome of fusing soil moisture and vapor pressure data was inferring the crop state regarding soil and plant water status following the concept of site specific agriculture to evaluate the impact of the method on crop yield we carried out two simulations the first one on a wsns simulator castalia to generate the irrigation decisions according to the site specific agrometeorological data collected from the wsn the second one on a crop simulation model apsim agricultural production systems simulator to simulate the oil palm plot at the study site under two treatments plot with irrigation managed by the inference method and plot without irrigation results from oil palm crop simulation showed a 27 increase in the production of bunches of fresh fruit between 2016 and 2017 in the treatment with irrigation the method has the potential for contributing to irrigation decision support systems and for being useful in yield intensification rather than crop extension politics for oil palm and other crops keywords decision making oil palm data fusion irrigation management wireless sensor networks site specific agriculture 1 introduction the use of climate science in agricultural planning can increase the capacity of farmers and farming planners to allocate resources effectively fao 2010 however it is necessary to tailor weather and climate information to a local level for individual farmers fao 2015 current information is inadequate to support effective decision making and to a considerable extent it is inaccessible to decision makers lipper et al 2014 therefore the gap between climate science and the application of information in the field must be closed in the sense that farmers better understand the implications of their decisions fao 2010 efforts to close the gap have suggested that if colombian farmers can understand the relationship between weather and climate forecasts with the responses of their crop production they can make better decisions on how to manage their farms loboguerrero et al 2018 in colombia oil palm elaeis guineensis jacq crops are characterized by a population of more than 70 of small scale farmers fedepalma 2015 who have an average yield lower by 7 tons of fresh fruit bunches per hectare compared to large scale farmers fedepalma 2013 the reason is that this group of farmers have low levels of technological adoption which leads to more significant gaps in yield social and environmental terms hinestroza 2018 according to fontanilla et al 2015 thanks to the application of good practices in small scale oil palm cultivations crop yield can increase from 25 to 84 and the net income of one grower per hectare can increase from 33 to 160 per year nevertheless for oil palm there are not many well founded manuals that adequately describe how to grow and manage oil palm crops hence farmers frequently have to make decisions based on a limited knowledge base cock et al 2016 not to mention that to achieve optimum yields in oil palm it is necessary to adopt management practices tailored to the needs of the site which are defined by their particular agro ecological conditions paramananthan 2003 moreover farmers need assistance in managing their oil palm crops since are under pressure of improving their economic and environmental sustainability chapman et al 2018 one opportunity in oil palm is to support irrigation management since water deficit stress is a critical yield limiting factor of oil palm crops carr 2011 corley and tinker 2016 woittiez et al 2017 irrigation management is an important aspect comte et al 2012 especially in areas where precipitation is below 100 mm per month paramananthan 2003 as reported by palat et al 2008 in southern thailand irrigation contributed to yield by increasing the production of fresh fruit bunches by 50 in crops irrigated daily during the dry season moreover improving yield while attending the increasing demand for palm oil based vegetable oils and biofuels oecd fao 2016 without raising crop areas is vital in south east asia oil palm crops and its expansion have been related to the destruction of the tropical forest the loss of biodiversity and the emission of greenhouse gasses fitzherbert et al 2008 koh and wilcove 2008 uusitalo et al 2014 vijay et al 2016 in latin america peru ecuador guatemala and brazil contributed most to deforestation when converting woody vegetation areas to oil palm crops furumo and aide 2017 notably in peru oil palm expansion is a great cause of amazon deforestation and loss of avian diversity bennett et al 2018 gutiérrez vélez et al 2011 srinivas and koh 2016 although in colombia oil palm crops are located mainly in what were formerly pastures and other agricultural areas castiblanco et al 2013 and that there are between 1 3 mha suitable for expansion without incurring in deforestation practices castiblanco et al 2013 upra 2017 or severe threats to biodiversity such as vertebrates ocampo peñuela et al 2018 others studies suggest the need to understand how the conversion of colombian savannas non forested ecosystems likely to be converted into oil palm areas can affect biodiversity in fauna pardo et al 2018 such as the work of lópez ricaurte et al 2017 in avian diversity the purpose of this work was to address the challenge of transforming raw agrometeorological information into accessible understandable and relevant agrometeorological information for decision making hansen and coffey 2011 in the context of oil palm plantations in colombia under an ideal scenario where site specific information is available through wireless sensor networks consequently the aim was to develop and to validate a method that supports decision making for site specific irrigation management under the urgent need for further investigation in irrigation regimes for a wide range of environmental conditions to close yield gaps woittiez et al 2017 this method could enable the development of systems that can proactively control irrigation responding to the plant soil atmosphere system in the future the method could contribute to the intensification of production on existing palm oil plantations oecd fao 2018 as land use change in the tropics has become a prominent topic lópez ricaurte et al 2017 1 1 irrigation decision making in oil palm according to corley and tinker 2016 the decision on when to irrigate requires information on the degree of water deficit stress suffered by the palms a way to estimate the stress is to calculate the soil water deficit which can be solved with agrometeorological information on soil water reserves corley and tinker 2016 by knowing the water retention curve of the crop soil and establishing the water amount points that define water soil dynamics the degree of water deficit stress can be determined as the difference between the volumetric water content soil moisture and the allowable soil water depletion point critical deficit then irrigation should be activated when soil moisture reaches a value below the critical deficit because by that point plant functions such as growth or yield start to be affected corley and tinker 2016 evans et al 1996 nevertheless stress due to water deficit is not only due to low soil water availability the deficit can occur because the stomata are closed due to dry air which is expressed as the vapor pressure difference between the leaf and the atmosphere franks and farquhar 1999 since plants continuously regulate transpiration by controlling the aperture of the stomatal pores on the surface of the leaf a high vapor pressure deficit vpd causes stomata to close while a low vdp causes stomata to open mcadam and brodribb 2015 this relationship between vpd leaf gas exchange and their effects on reducing stomatal conductance has been widely observed in a variety of plant species oren et al 1999 and particularly in oil palm smith 1989 as reported by henson and harun 2005 it has been well characterized in oil palm that vpd exerts a major influence on canopy photosynthesis via its effect on stomatal conductance for instance dufrêne and saugier 1993 reported for oil palm an exponential decrease in stomatal conductance in the vpd range from 1 0 to 4 5 kpa and a linear reduction in the transpiration rate a decrease in photosynthesis when the vpd exceeded 1 8 kpa this latter value was confirmed by henson 1995 estimating that the photosynthesis of the canopy was reduced by half when the vpd increased from 0 8 to 2 0 kpa henson and chang 1990 and kallarackal et al 2004 stated that a vdp value above 1 8 kpa would affect oil palm photosynthesis even under sufficient soil water availability smith 1989 and dufrêne and saugier 1993 stated that it is necessary a vpd value greater than 1 8 kpa for photosynthesis to be affected when palms are under well watered conditions however results in smith 1989 were measured in controlled conditions which are a bit far from the actual circumstances differences between vdp critical value for photosynthesis and stomatal behavior could be originated when using different measurement techniques carr 2011 and different measurement scenarios correlated environmental conditions to have a conservative position on this we decided to select 1 8 kpa as the irrigation decision making inflection point in other words irrigation should not be activated when vpd reaches 1 8 kpa because palms photosynthetic rate begins to be limited 1 2 wireless sensor networks for site specific agriculture over recent years wireless sensor networks wsns have emerged as new sources of observations in agriculture which allows agrometeorological information systems to operate with a variety of cost effective high performance and reliable sensors mirhosseini et al 2017 the general architecture of a wsn consists of a set of autonomous devices spatially deployed which collaboratively collect data on a particular phenomenon and transmit them wirelessly akyildiz et al 2002 culler and hong 2004 yick et al 2008 devices classified as node sensors tens to thousands a sink node and a gateway sensor nodes are responsible for detecting measuring processing and sending the data of the phenomenon under study by multi hop communication to the sink node akyildiz et al 2002 akyildiz and vuran 2010 then the data concentrated in the sink node which has computational capabilities superior to sensor nodes is forwarded to a gateway to transmit it outside the network alternatively data is sent to a base station that is a device directly connected to a computer for dissemination and analysis by providing a new way to observe the crop and its environment ma et al 2011 wsns are already recognized as a powerful technology for the collection and processing of data in the domain of agriculture borgia 2014 especially under the concept of site specific agriculture initially site specific agriculture was used as a synonym of precision agriculture johannsen and carter 2005 and it was defined as the management of crops on a smaller spatial scale than that of the whole crop plant 2001 however these two concepts are currently differentiated jarvis et al 2013 precision agriculture emphasizes crop management at a higher resolution within the plot guided by a factor whereas site specific agriculture guides crop management by the study of the variability between management units under a combination of factors environmental conditions and agricultural management practices cock et al 2011 jarvis et al 2013 jiménez et al 2016 in oil palm crops it is usual to divide plantations into management units according to the biophysical resources regarding climate soil water planting material and age of the crop munévar et al 2011 rubiano 2005 because the differentiated management by crop units has the effect of increasing crop yield garzón et al 2005 romero et al 2008 thus wsns deployed over vast areas observing multiple variables on the plant soil atmosphere system are mean to realize site specific agriculture this is particularly important in developing countries where farmers need to learn how to manage their crops at the plot level rather than refining the management practices of their crops within the plot level cock et al 2011 jiménez et al 2016 experiences in the adoption of site specific management practices from colombian sugarcane farmers have proved an increase in productivity and profitability isaacs et al 2007 this paper describes the development of a method for assisting irrigation decision making in oil palm crops guided by the information provided from a wsn and then uses this method to evaluate in silico its effects on crop yield under the decision support provided 2 material and methods based on the developed concepts above we formulated an inference method for irrigation decision making in oil palm under a scenario where agrometeorological information is available through a wsn also we simulated the method to obtain irrigation decisions with agrometeorological information from one plot of a plantation site in colombia and we simulated the crop performance under the irrigation decisions taken at the first simulation 2 1 study site the agrometeorological data used for the method was based on data from an oil palm plantation located at palmar de la vizcaína experiment field station santander colombia 6 58 n 73 42 w at an altitude of 140 m with average conditions of 75 of relative humidity and 32 c of average daily temperature bayona rodríguez and romero 2016 a plot from the plantation was selected as the study site under the criterium that agrometeorological data was especially available at that level of spatial resolution the datasets from the study site covered a time from august 20th of 2015 to may 31st of 2017 the selected plot has an area of 10 ha with seven years old oil palms which were planted in a triangular distance of 9 m the critical values for irrigation were 30 of soil moisture specifically for the plot soil and 1 8 kpa general for oil palm according to the water retention curve of the soil at the study site data not shown it was established that 30 of soil moisture equals a soil water potential of 0 5 mpa different authors have stated that this soil water potential corresponds to a water deficit event that sustained in time affects the growth and yield of the plant aston and lawlor 1979 jazayeri et al 2015 rivera et al 2012 fig 1 shows an aerial photograph of the plot 2 2 variables for irrigation decision making in oil palm there were identified two variables to manage irrigation decision making soil moisture and vapor pressure deficit the first one advises the necessity to irrigate oil palms while the second one advises the moment to irrigate oil palms by using the measured volumetric water content and the volumetric water content at the critical deficit point we estimated the soil water status moreover by using the measured vapor pressure deficit and the vapor pressure deficit at the photosynthesis declining point we related the stomata conductance to the plant water status with the method we fused the estimation and relation made to infer the irrigation decision from the soil and plant perspective methods to evaluate soil water status commonly refer to soil moisture content measurement and soil water potential measurement jones 2007 methods to directly characterize plant water status often refer to water potential measurement or relative water content measurement whereas indirect methods refer to stomatal conductance measurement stem diameter variations tracking or using sap flow sensor among others giménez et al 2013 for instance in oil palm stomatal conductance is a sensitive indicator of plant water status carr 2011 henson et al 2005 assessed some methods to value soil and plant water status in oil palm crops which included leaf or canopy temperature leaf water potential sap flux evapotranspiration soil water depletion spear leaf accumulation frond production rate inflorescence abortion reduced sex ratio bunch number reduction reduced fruit yield and others bayona rodríguez and romero 2016 used the leaf water potential as an indicator of palm water stress under deficit events to do so they used a schölander pressure chamber the measurements were performed predawn following the protocol established in bayona et al 2007 as the methods to characterize the plant water status can be labor intensive and request for specialized instruments while following measurement protocols we decided to use an approximate approach and keep it simple by using the relation between stomatal conductance and vapor pressure deficit to estimate the palm water status for more information on the association of vapor pressure deficit with stomatal conductance and photosynthesis refer to corley and tinker 2016 carr 2011 henson 1995 and dufrêne and saugier 1993 after identifying these variables for irrigation decision making we assessed how often to make irrigation decisions if it should be done hourly daily weekly or monthly as reported by corley and tinker 2003 the measurement or estimation of water deficit stress per week should be sufficient since evapotranspiration per week is very unlikely to exceed 40 mm and the critical deficit in oil palm is higher than that according to expert advice data should be consolidated every 3rd day first thing in the morning and decide whether to or not to activate the irrigation for oil palms bayona personal communication 2017 for our work we computed data at 6 o clock in the morning however watering should be started between 7 30 and 8 00 a m since stomatal conductance is at its peak in that time kallarackal et al 2004 smith 1989 which will mean a better uptake of water from palms given the fact that adaptive responses in plants to droughts develop over timescales of days to weeks as drought itself water deficit stress measurements for agronomic purposes should be integrated over time and space instead of preferring instantaneous measurements jones 2007 thus for irrigation decision making soil moisture collected from the sensor network is averaged from the previous three days at the term of making an irrigation decision on the other hand plant responses controlled through hormonal signaling are appropriate to be measured instantaneously if directly dependent on local status jones 2007 in angiosperms such as oil palm stomata response to vapor pressure deficit appears to be driven by changes in the foliar concentration of the plant hormone abscisic acid mcadam and brodribb 2015 in consequence the vapor pressure deficit can be estimated under instantaneous environmental conditions and not integrative recordings over time still analysis of continuous records offers a dynamic picture of plant and soil water status and therefore holds promise for increasing the precision of irrigation decision making goldhamer et al 1999 in table 1 we present the management of variables for irrigation decision making in oil palm considering that wsns can be deployed at a representative spatial scale which translates into facilitating and improving the skills of farmers to accessing to data at the local level gutman and robert 2013 wang et al 2006 and that weather and climate conditions tend to show continuous variation without abrupt changes or discontinuities unlike soils that can vary significantly over minimum distances cock et al 2011 we proposed that irrigation decision making in oil palm should be managed at the plot level and a wsn could be deployed per plot to collect soil moisture and vapor pressure data 2 3 specification of agrometeorological data considering that representative agrometeorological data was necessary for the method and that the selected plot did not count with a wsn we used the available data from one source to recreate a scenario from the study site in which agrometeorological information was collected through a wsn the agrometeorological information was obtained from one micrometeorological station biomet 103 associated with an eddy covariance system li cor inc 2011 installed at the plot the station is equipped with sensors that observe the soil plant atmosphere system the sensors make measurements every minute except the wind speed that is measured at a rate of 10 hz as the station is located within the crop it makes representative observations of the microclimate since it intends to monitor and operationally support the local agricultural situation wmo 2010 both soil moisture and vapor pressure deficit data the latter calculated with air temperature and relative humidity data was used to generate datasets since the station is equipped with three stevens hydra probe ii stevens water monitoring systems inc n d sensors of soil moisture and one hmp155 vaisala 2012 sensor of relative humidity and ambient temperature there were created four datasets from the four records of sensors information records from the four sensors amounted to more than 3 7 million data the datasets covered a time from august 20th of 2015 to may 31st of 2017 soil moisture datasets were created from averaging soil moisture over the three days before the time of the irrigation decision every 3rd day at 6 a m according to eq 1 moreover the vapor pressure deficit dataset was created by calculating deficit with data from relative humidity and air temperature at the time of decision 6 a m with eq 2 as such the first register of the datasets corresponds to august 23rd of 2015 at 6 o clock in the morning 2 4 inference method in the method we used the dempster shafer inference technique over other techniques because it provides a formalism to manage data uncertainty by expressing a degree of belief which supports or refutes a hypothesis gros 1997 furthermore it allows combining data from sensors giving distinct levels of detail nakamura et al 2007 on the one hand in a wireless sensor network data comes from sensor nodes which observe physical properties that are continuously evolving in time hence a sensor only gives us a snapshot of that evolution which means that the measurements are not 100 true mitchell 2012 on the other hand according to the irrigation decision making concept presented above the variables that determine the degree of water deficit stress are soil moisture and vapor pressure deficit these variables describe different physical quantities therefore are expressed in different units of measurement and cannot be directly related 2 4 1 dempster shafer inference technique this technique is based on the theory of the accumulation of evidence formulated from the work of dempster 2008 1968 in the understanding and refinement of fisher s approach to the inference of probability which was later formalized by shafer 1996 1992 1976 towards a generalization of the bayesian inference in dempster shafer inference technique farias et al 2014 gros 1997 khaleghi et al 2013 nakamura et al 2007 the θ represents the set of possible states that describe a system θ θ 1 θ n where each element of the set is exclusive in the sense that the system can only be found in a state at a given moment and that the set of 2 θ represents all possible subsets of θ whose elements are the hypotheses the dempster shafer theory assigns the mass function m to each hypothesis h of 2 θ which represents the possible propositions regarding the state of the system according to the mass function m 2 θ 0 1 it is satisfied that the mass function of an empty set is zero 3 m 0 also the mass function of a hypothesis h is greater than or equal to zero 4 m h 0 h 2 θ and the sum of the mass function of all the hypotheses is equal to 1 as 5 h 2 θ m h 1 the confidence interval in a hypothesis h is defined as the range between its belief and its plausibility as bel h pl h which is the true belief about the hypothesis h the belief in a hypothesis h the belief function b e l 2 θ 0 1 over θ is 6 bel h a h m a where bel 1 and bel θ 1 and the doubt in a hypothesis h is expressed according to the belief function as 7 do h bel h a h m a the plausibility of a hypothesis h the plausibility function p l 2 θ 0 1 over θ is defined as 8 pl h 1 do h a h m a to combine the evidence provided by different sources over a hypothesis h there is a combination rule which integrates the effects of two mass functions m 1 and m 2 as 9 m 1 m 2 h a b h m 1 a m 2 b 1 a b m 1 a m 2 b where the combination of mass functions of an empty set is zero 10 m 1 m 2 0 as an advantage the dempster shafer inference technique allows grasping ignorance or an inability to distinguish between possible states so that probabilities over a state are associated only when support information is available in the theory of probability bayesian inference this would be treated in a very different way by assigning an equal or uniform probability to each possible state the use of the discernment framework as the set θ is called allows for a much richer representation of beliefs 2 4 2 inferring irrigation decisions irrigation management is based among other issues on making decisions about whether y e s or n o t to irrigate thus this decision can be reduced to a process of inference about the state of the crop given a set of possible states it is necessary to infer what the actual state of the crop is since it is only needed to water when it is necessary and adequate to irrigate in agreement with the irrigation decision making concept in oil palm the states of the crop can refer to n o r m a l n and c r i t i c a l c the first refers when the plants have sufficient soil moisture or when the environmental conditions are not appropriate of watering and the second refers when the plants have insufficient soil moisture and environmental conditions are optimal for watering thus the discernment framework is the set θ n c and the quantity of hypothesis is 2 θ 2 2 4 being the hypothesis set h θ n c n c the dempster shafer inference technique works with pieces of evidence which are represented by mass functions therefore to formulate the method it was necessary to translate the agrometeorological variables that indicate the need and time of irrigation soil moisture during the last three days and vapor pressure deficit into mass functions to be fused using the dempster shafer combination rule in line with what was reported in section 1 1 on irrigation decision making in oil palm and with the critical values for the plot the mass functions of the method are defined below when soil moisture decreases 0 θ 30 it means that there is a non zero belief that water is needed for the crop also when θ tends to 0 this belief increases therefore to translate θ into evidence we define the mass function m 1 2 θ 0 1 for the hypothesis set as follows 11 m 1 c 1 θ 0 θ 30 0 θ 30 m 1 n 1 m 1 c m 1 n c 0 m 1 0 the above means that soil moisture establishes a state c r i t i c a l of a need for irrigation when soil moisture is less than 30 n o r m a l of no need for irrigation complementary to the critical state when the soil moisture is greater than or equal to 30 and that the hypothesis of n c has a mass equal to 0 since soil moisture during the last three days cannot define a state of non belief on n o r m a l n or c r i t i c a l c moreover when the vapor pressure deficit decreases v p d 1 8 k p a means that there is a non zero belief that it is appropriate to irrigate the crop also when v p d tends to 0 this belief increases therefore to translate v p d into evidence we define the mass function m 2 2 θ 0 1 for the hypothesis set as follows 12 m 2 c 1 v p d 1 8 w v p d 1 8 0 v p d 1 8 m 2 n 1 m 2 c m 2 n c 0 m 2 0 where w 1 75 this weight is given to m 2 c with the goal that the belief assigned by this mass has a smaller impact on the decision of irrigation the reason is that this weight softens the response of the method at estimating a c r i t i c a l state by the moment factor because the need factor must be more decisive in the management of irrigation according to the mass function due to vapor pressure deficit a state is established c r i t i c a l of a right moment for irrigation when the vapor pressure deficit is less than 1 8 kpa n o r m a l of a no right moment for irrigation complementary to the critical state when the vapor pressure deficit is greater than or equal to 1 8 kpa and that the hypothesis of n c has a mass equal to 0 because the vapor pressure deficit cannot define a state of nonbelief about n o r m a l n or c r i t i c a l c to estimate the state of the crop that decides whether or not irrigation should be activated i the beliefs assigned by m 1 and m 2 are combined using the dempster shafer combination rule ii the belief and plausibility of each hypothesis n o r m a l n and c r i t i c a l c con are calculated with respect to m 1 m 2 iii the most plausible state is chosen if both states are equally plausible the most credible is chosen if both states are equally plausible and credible the n o r m a l n state is chosen finally if it is inferred that the state of the crop is c r i t i c a l c the decision is that y e s it is suitable irrigating the plot on the contrary if it is inferred that the state of the crop is n o r m a l n the decision is that n o it is not suitable irrigating the plot 2 5 inference method simulation the proposed method was simulated assuming as the simulation scenario the oil palm plot with a wsn deployed to acquire local and representative data from the crop the wns data was recreated from the datasets generated on soil moisture and vapor pressure deficit from the plot at the study site for the simulation castalia program was used this is an open source simulator for wireless sensor networks and body area networks which is widely used in the academic and research community pediaditakis et al 2010 because it allowed the simulation of the wsn with the inference method and the recreation of physical processes in a very flexible way castalia was used in its version 3 2 boulis 2011 running on omnet in its version 4 4 1 opensim ltd 2014 table 2 summarizes the main configurations made for the simulation in this work a square area corresponding to the plot was recreated with a wsn deployed the network counted with 72 sensor nodes organized in a grid of 9 8 and connected in a tree topography by the routing protocol of gnawali et al 2009 since soil moisture varies in space much more than air temperature and relative humidity the first variable is conditioned by factors such as soil type and topography whereas the second and third variables are widely established in the atmosphere for the plot the 72 sensor nodes in the simulation were arranged to monitor the variable behavior of soil moisture in the plot while only one sensor node was arranged to monitor the air temperature and relative humidity to calculate the vapor pressure deficit also a physical process module was configured in castalia to recreate the soil moisture behavior with the three soil moisture datasets transformed into three information sources this module is based on a model in which an arbitrary number of information sources influence is diffused over space boulis 2011 in castalia an information source is a string of snapshots each snapshot describes time s position x m position y m and value of the physical property the three datasets created from the soil moisture sensors were organized into three strings of snapshots since the sensors at the micrometeorological station are static that is position x and position y are fixated but we had to recreate the soil moisture in the entire 10 ha plot a fictitious location was defined for each snapshot with random numbers within the area of deployment thus each soil moisture snapshot was located at a new point in the plot the measurement of each sensor node over a physical property was defined by eq 13 boulis 2011 which implies that a measurement keeps a spatial correlation with all information sources because the effect of multiple sources is additive each soil moisture measurement is the sum of the values provided by the three information sources consequently to avoid multiplying the soil moisture measurements by three the soil moisture values at the datasets were divided into three when creating the strings of snapshots 13 v p t a l l s o u r c e s i v i t k d i p t 1 a n 0 σ where v p t value of the physical process at point p at time t vi t value of the ith source at time t di p t distance of point p from the ith source at time t k a are parameters that determine how is the value from a source diffused n 0 σ is a zero mean gaussian random variable with standard deviation σ the p point is the location of the sensor node within the deployment area which in this case is related to the deployment in the grid of 9 8 the parameters k a and σ are configurable in the module it was defined k 0 and a 1 then the division factor is 1 and the value defined by the information source is maintained and σ 0 2 to introduce the lowest noise in the measurements and keep them as faithful as possible to the real soil moisture data before using the 72 sensor nodes as data sources whose information was translated into beliefs with the method the plot was divided into three zones hence the soil moisture measurements were consolidated by zone consequently the set of sensor nodes was divided into three subsets each related to a zone and their measurements were averaged in the end for the inference method applied every 3rd day at 6 in the morning four values entered three average soil moisture values an average for each zone and one value from vapor pressure deficit based on these values the estimation of the soil water status and the relation of stomatal conductance to plant water status were used to infer irrigation decisions at the crop plot 2 6 oil palm yield simulation the irrigation decisions derived from the inference method were translated into irrigation operations in a modeling framework to evaluate its impact on crop yield in this way the plot at the study site was taken to simulation to compare two irrigation treatments namely plot with irrigation managed by the inference method and plot without irrigation for the simulation of the oil palm plot the agricultural production systems simulator apsim software was used the apsim model for oil palm was developed by huth et al 2014 and we used it for our crop simulation the model uses widely tested submodels for the water carbon and nutrient cycle and based on these makes predictions of oil palm growth and crop yield per unit area nelson et al 2015a it simulates the growth of leaves stem root and fresh fruit bunches in response to inputs which are mainly data from the daily weather report soil information and crop management practices also the model estimates the use of resources and the flow of organic matter for the palm okoro et al 2017 considering that huth et al 2014 parametrized and tested the model based on data from three sites in papua new guinea we adapted the model to the data available of the study site in colombia for this simulation two treatments were compared plot with irrigation and plot without irrigation with the same input data except the first treatment which included irrigation operations derived from the decisions of the inference method while the second did not include irrigation operations the primary resources used for the simulation are described below 2 6 1 daily weather report data the climate variables used for the simulation were solar radiation mj m2 maximum temperature c minimum temperature c and precipitation mm since the simulation requires this data from year 1 of sowing which for the case of the plot is 2011 it was necessary to use data from a weather station of the national institute of hydrology meteorology and environmental studies known as ideam installed in the study site the daily weather records go from january 1st of 2011 to december 31st of 2017 2 6 2 soil data because comprehensive soil information about the plot at the study site was not available the soil data of the oil palm crop in sangara at papua new guinea huth et al 2014 was used this site has a sandy clay loam of soil type as stated by huth et al 2014 while the application of the apsim oil palm model is promising the availability of crucial data is likely to restrict its use from the lessons of the model building authors recognize that the parameterization of soil models was a difficulty because of information lacking hence they resorted to a variety of information sources in our case we had restrictive soil data and decided to run the simulation based on sangara conditions in okoro et al 2017 as authors had some information on soil soil texture and soil volumetric water content all other soil parameters were taken from huth et al 2014 nevertheless there are methods to address information uncertainty which will require us further work in gathering soil information if we want the irrigation method to be available for decision making by farmers and managers fundamental work on the matter is reported by nelson et al 2015b which presents a transect based method for monitoring soil properties in oil palm plantations over time some specific changes to sangara characteristics of the soil water phase are indicated in table 3 2 6 3 crop management data in the case of fertilization at the plot table 4 presents the fertilization operations entered in the simulation model this information was recreated from factual information on fertilizers dates and quantities applied in the years 2016 and 2017 for the previous years there was no information available also only the fertilizers that provide nitrogen were considered since the model only takes into account the cycle of this nutrient in the growth and development of oil palm moreover in the case of irrigation for the treatment of plot with irrigation irrigation operations were created between august 20th of 2015 to may 31st of 2017 according to the decisions resulting from the application of the inference method in the first simulation the decision to y e s it is suitable irrigating the plot resulted in the application of 15 mm of water whereas the decision to n o it is not suitable irrigating the plot resulted in the application of 0 mm of water considering that the irrigation events were decided every 3rd day a level of water of 15 mm is sufficient to compensate the evapotranspiration in that period if it was necessary to water the reason is that in general it is considered that the evapotranspiration of the adult palm crop is of the order of 5 mm day 1 or 150 mm m 1 as reviewed by carr 2011 studies report transpiration rates in oil palm plantations from 3 3 to 6 5 mm day 1 in the dry season and 1 3 3 8 mm day 1 on the rainy season also it is estimated that in months with 10 or less rainy days the evapotranspiration is 150 mm m 1 and that in months with 11 or more days of rain is 120 mm m 1 according to the irho method for calculating the water deficit bakoumé et al 2013 keong and keng 2012 palat et al 2008 according to the estimated evapotranspiration for the oil palm plantation where the plot is located during august 20th of 2015 to may 31st of 2017 values between 11 and 17 mm were reported for three cumulative days the fao penman monteith equation was used to calculate the reference crop evapotranspiration eto and the crop evapotranspiration under standard conditions etc was calculated using a crop coefficient kc of 0 9 as a value between the range indicated for oil palm by henson 1995 3 results and discussion this section presents results on the inference method and its simulation for irrigation management with the available agrometeorological information of the plot 3 1 inference technique according to bouma 1997 a challenge for science is to create methods that can characterize the spatiotemporal variability of crops in favor that farmers can use the information effectively to improve their management practices thus there are required ways to bring raw information to accessible understandable and relevant information for decision making hansen and coffey 2011 to address the challenge we formulated the method using a technique from data fusion a discipline that includes the application of techniques to support human or automated decision making boström et al 2007 data fusion gros 1997 and specifically multisensor data fusion hall and llinas 1997 varshney 2000 is a set of techniques that combine data from multiple sensors to provide higher value to information than the one that could be achieved using a single sensor the definition of higher value can refer to the obtaining of higher precision estimation description or quality of the information the synergistic combination of data from sensors allows us to make inferences about information hence improving the performance of a task by better understanding the current situation and better supporting decisions nakamura et al 2007 inference techniques in data fusion are often applied to obtain decisions on the knowledge of the perceived situation which is provided by many sources inference refers to a transition from a proposition that is probably true to verification of its veracity farias et al 2014 nakamura et al 2007 there are several techniques within the data fusion for the realization of inferences nakamura et al 2007 among the most outstanding are the bayesian inference the dempster shafer inference and the fuzzy logic in the method we used the dempster shafer inference technique over other techniques because it provides a formalism to manage data uncertainty gros 1997 and allows combining data from sensors giving distinct levels of detail nakamura et al 2007 on the one hand in a wireless sensor network data comes from sensor nodes which observe physical properties that are continuously evolving in time hence a sensor only gives us a snapshot of that evolution which means that the measurements are not 100 true since the sensor provides an estimate of the measured physical property mitchell 2012 besides sensor nodes are numerous devices that can fail abdelgawad and bayoumi 2012 kulkarni et al 2011 luo and kay 1989 nakamura et al 2007 which supposes errors in the measurements of the parameters and vulnerability to faults abdelgawad and bayoumi 2012 on the other hand according to the irrigation decision making concept presented above the variables that determine the degree of water deficit stress are soil moisture and vapor pressure deficit these variables describe different physical quantities therefore are expressed in different units of measurement and cannot be directly related nevertheless as explained their integration is a synergy that helps to understand the soil plant atmosphere relationship better and to establish water deficit of oil palms to execute irrigation 3 2 inference method for irrigation management for practically defining irrigation scheduling farmers have conventional methods that aim to maintain soil water close to or above field capacity this by making a direct measurement of soil moisture content or by the use of soil water balance calculations jones 2013 to these practices in oil palm are reported by lascano 1998 nevertheless because of soils heterogeneity the use of stand alone instruments that offer single point measurements are not adequate since data is not representative jones 2007 nor the estimation of soil moisture content is sufficient since it is subject to cumulative errors and depends on a good definition of crop coefficients jones 2013 an example of irrigation management for oil palm based on potential evapotranspiration estimations can be found on mejía et al 2006 also there are methods for irrigation scheduling based on the plant water status but are more restrictive because are labor intensive and often require specialized training and equipment jones 2013 here we proposed an inference method that combined some advantages of conventional and plant based methods and that addressed some of their limitations by directly measuring soil water content and estimating stomatal closure first the method used soil moisture data from multiple sensors deployed in a network which collected representative data on the soil water status from a crop plot second the method used the vapor pressure deficit as an indirect indicator of the plant water status regarding stomatal aperture by doing this we have a method appropriate for irrigation decision making supported on direct and indirect measurements of the soil plant atmosphere system which attends the crop water requirement for each geographical location this is particularly important for oil palm since the water requirement is relatively unknown kallarackal et al 2004 3 3 irrigation decisions for the irrigation decisions simulation in a crop plot scenario with a wsn castalia program was used this is an open source simulator for wireless sensor networks and body area networks which is widely used in the academic and research community pediaditakis et al 2010 according to its creators pham et al 2007 the reason for creating castalia is that before there was not a simulator that could recreate precise communication models wireless channels and radio models and that was also reliable and fast given this need castalia was ideally suited for the design and validation of algorithms and protocols in addition to being relatively easy to use pediaditakis et al 2010 the main reason for using castalia in this work was that it allowed the simulation of the wsn and the inference method indifferent of a particular wsn platform and also allowed the recreation of physical processes in a very flexible way the results from the simulation are presented here as the relationship between the average soil moisture and the vapor pressure deficit with the decisions taken figs 2 8 depict the averages of soil moisture the vapor pressure deficit and the irrigation decision taken by date the left vertical axis is the percentage of soil moisture and the right vertical axis is the vapor pressure deficit in kpa and the decision taken for the latter a 1 value means y e s to irrigate and a 0 value means n o to irrigate thus for example in fig 2 for october 10th of 2015 the soil moisture averages were below 25 the steam pressure deficit was 0 kpa and the decision was y e s to irrigate on octuber 13th of 2015 the soil moisture averages were above 30 the vapor pressure deficit was 0 kpa and the decision was n o to irrigate as observed in the figures that the three averages of soil moisture were below 30 ensured that the decision made was y e s to irrigate here the question that arose was about what is the incidence of vapor pressure deficit in the irrigation decisions according to the agrometeorological information received from the study site the vapor pressure deficit at 6 o clock in the morning never exceeded 0 4315 kpa march 31st of 2016 that is at that time the deficit always inferred a critical state of the crop and supported a positive irrigation decision while critical values of vapor pressure deficit greater than or equal to 1 8 kpa were only reached between 1 30 p m and 10 45 p m in the study site if the irrigation decision were made between those hours the vapor pressure deficit would have real competition in the irrigation decision making process overall the time lapse in which the crop was inferred in a n o r m a l state was greater than the time lapse when the crop was inferred in a c r i t i c a l state for example throughout period 5 fig 6 enough soil moisture was maintained for crop growth and crop yield thus ensuring a permanent n o r m a l state the periods with the most marked dry seasons were 1 2 3 and 6 figs 2 4 and 7 where at least half of the time the crop was in a c r i t i c a l state on the other hand periods 4 and 7 figs 5 and 8 were dominated by seasons marked with soil moisture above the critical value 30 which are most likely related to rainy seasons inclusively in the figures it can be recognized that the decisions of y e s to irrigate were persistent between the months of december to march april which are summer months for the colombian region where the study site is located in fact according to lascano 1998 this region usually suffers a dry season between november to april that affects crop yield the averages of the soil moisture measurements recreated from the three datasets varied from 10 to 45 meanwhile the records of the three sensors varied from 6 to 65 this indicates that the agrometeorological information of the micrometeorological station was useful at representing a wsn monitoring the plot however the ideal scenario to validate the inference method for irrigation management would be one in which a wsn monitors the plot whose measurements are subject to uncertainty and where the dempster shafer technique helps manage the inaccurate data derived from it one more question that arose was decided y e s to irrigate when to stop watering the deactivation of irrigation was not addressed in the inference method since the primary purpose was to decide whether to water or not in general in irrigation systems this issue is handled in two ways by time or by a condition that is the irrigation is stopped after a pre defined time or the irrigation is stopped when a variable reaches a condition in the work of amaral teles et al 2016 palm oil crops are irrigated with micro sprinkler every 4th day for four hours during the summer season in works on irrigation management systems supported by wsns deactivation strategies differ for example in gutierrez jaguey et al 2015 and mitralexis and goumopoulos 2015 irrigation stops after a predetermined time moreover in coates et al 2013 mafuta et al 2013 and sales et al 2015 irrigation is stopped when it is satisfied a conditional value bearing in mind that irrigation management is optimal if it is based on data collected in real time it is estimated as a future work of the method to establish a deactivation strategy that includes increasing the sampling frequency of soil moisture and vapor pressure deficit while irrigation is active and stopping irrigation if a threshold value to be determined of soil moisture is reached or if the critical value of the vapor pressure deficit is reached 1 8 kpa 3 4 oil palm yield for the simulation of the oil palm plot the agricultural production systems simulator apsim software was used this program offers a modeling framework for agricultural and livestock systems developed with high standards from science and software engineering internationally recognized apsim initiative n d holzworth et al 2014 the results from the simulation are presented here as the relationship between precipitation irrigation decisions and crop yield for the two scenarios with irrigation and without irrigation fig 9 presents the annual crop yield reported by apsim regarding precipitation irrigation water and fertilization at the plot the left vertical axis is the crop yield in tons of fresh fruit bunches ffb per hectare per year moreover the right vertical axis is the water level in millimeters of annual precipitation and irrigation also the right vertical axis is the amount of fertilizer applied in kilograms per hectare per year for instance in 2015 the precipitation was 3386 mm year 1 the irrigation was 360 mm year 1 for the scenario with irrigation the fertilization was 0 kg ha 1 year 1 and the crop yield for the two scenarios with irrigation and without irrigation was 4 tffb ha 1 year 1 in fig 10 the same results are presented monthly the left vertical axis and the right vertical axis refer to the same units in fig 33 but per month hence for example for march of 2016 the precipitation was 182 mm month 1 the irrigation was 150 mm month 1 for the scenario with irrigation the fertilization was 0 kg ha 1 month 1 and crop yield for the scenario with irrigation was 30 tffb ha 1 month 1 and for the scenario without irrigation was 26 tffb ha 1 month 1 as shown in fig 9 and as reported by goh 2000 paramananthan 2003 and paramananthan et al 2000 regarding the climatic suitability classification for oil palm productivity the year 2016 had an inadequate aptitude as low precipitations occurred on the other hand the other years were in the adequate range when having annual precipitations from 1700 up to 3000 mm year 1 except for the year 2015 which exceeded 3300 mm year 1 that is it was a moderately suitable year of productivity hence it calls attention that this year was applied 360 mm year 1 of water for irrigation while for the years 2016 and 2017 the water used for irrigation was justified since these years had precipitations below 2000 mm year 1 in other words years with slightly limited precipitation for productivity to better understand what happened in the last three years 2015 2016 and 2017 fig 10 presents received precipitation and irrigation applied monthly although the year 2015 far exceeded the adequate annual amount of precipitation in reality the rainfalls focused on the first half of the year the second semester of 2015 had comparatively less rainfall and was also the time from which irrigation decisions begin to be made by the inference method august 20th of 2015 which is why the application of water for irrigation is observed from that moment on with respect to 2016 this was a crucial year for the implementation of irrigation because it had precipitations below 1000 mm year 1 in total in 2016 645 mm year 1 of irrigation water was applied an amount higher than 2017 when 270 mm year 1 was applied taking into account that not only the annual amount of precipitation is essential but the distribution of the same with a minimum monthly requirement of 100 mm month 1 paramananthan 2003 moreover taking into account that soil moisture was one of the agrometeorological variables from which the irrigation decisions of the inference method were derived which is mainly determined by the climate in the two or three previous months cock et al 2016 it can be better understood that in the second half of 2016 despite the low precipitations no more water was applied for irrigation and that the low water reserves in soil began until the beginning of 2017 likewise it can be better understood that although the year 2015 had greater precipitations than 2017 3386 mm year 1 and 1857 mm year 1 respectively in the former more water was applied for irrigation than in the latter initially in 2015 as already mentioned the rains were more intense in the first semester than in the second semester whereas in 2017 precipitations were better distributed throughout the year that is soil moisture was more stable and that ensured a lower number of positive irrigation decisions besides irrigation decisions only operated until may 31st of 2017 only agrometeorological information of the plot was available to this day and therefore no more water was accumulated for irrigation that year on fertilization it was evident in figs 9 and 10 that only fertilizing operations were carried out between may of 2016 and december of 2017 with an annual application of around 400 kg ha 1 year 1 from year 1 to year 5 no fertilization operations were recorded according to the information provided on the plot worryingly enough the recommended range for nitrogen the only nutrient considered by the crop model for immature palms can range from 48 to 90 kg ha 1 year 1 bessou et al 2017 choo et al 2011 while in mature palms it can range from 56 to 191 kg ha 1 year 1 foster 2003 without considering that the application of fertilization is particular to each cultivation site caliman et al 2004 and in that sense the application rate should be adjusted to the soil conditions of the plot still according to mosquera et al 2017 fertilization participates in the costs of maintenance of the crop since year 1 and is in fact the cost of greater participation in the cultivation of oil palm then it is believed that the lack of information on fertilization is due to a lack of record and not to an absence of fertilizers in the crop what is certain is that the lack of information on fertilization in the simulation model from year 1 to year 5 2011 to 2015 affected the predicted crop yield moreover this introduces the uncertainty of how much the fertilization factor led to a delay and a decrease in the production of fresh fruit bunches to provide further reliability to the predictions on the crop outcomes more information about fertilization should be gathered regarding the projected crop yield in the plot under the two treatments although water for irrigation begins to be applied in august of 2015 it was from january 2016 when differences were marked in favor of the scenario with irrigation the reason is that the fructification in palm oil is continuous then there are always delayed effects of soil water deficit in yield carr 2011 and also delayed effects of irrigation on yield knowing that losses in crop yield depend on when the deficit occurs concerning the stage of development of the inflorescence turner 1977 it is established that the same happens with yield gains due to irrigation when observing the period between december of 2015 and march of 2016 figs 3 and 4 as a time of water deficit soil moisture below 30 and observing march and april of 2017 fig 10 as the months with the greatest yield differences between the two treatments the delay in the effect of drought and irrigation on yield was even more evident in these months yield differences of 18 4 t ha 1 month 1 and 16 8 t ha 1 month 1 between treatments were reached however as reported by turner 1977 the effects of drought on yield occur 21 26 months later by classification the study site has suitable climatic conditions for oil palm productivity except for the year 2016 which was a year impacted by the el niño climate phenomenon according to the drought reported between the end of 2015 and the beginning of 2016 madr 2016 2015 this suitability means that in the study site the benefit of irrigation is discreet compared to that which could be established in places with more marked and extensive dry periods which does happen in plantations located in northern colombian region where the dry period usually extends between november to july lascano and munévar 2000 as expected the simulation estimated a higher crop yield for the plot under irrigation treatment which demonstrates the usefulness of the inference method in supporting decision making plus the positive impact on crop management due to the inference method between treatments as shown in fig 9 in 2016 the estimated yield difference was 4 6 t ha 1 year 1 and for 2017 was 12 7 t ha 1 year 1 this resulted in a 27 increase in the production of bunches of fresh fruit between 2016 and 2017 which allows us to affirm that the method has impact potential for the palm agroindustry in colombia and in other countries where the oil palm also develops 4 conclusions the challenge of bringing raw information to accessible understandable and relevant information for decision making was addressed in this work under an ideal scenario where agrometeorological information was available through a wsn at an oil palm plot we formulated an inference method to assist decision making for irrigation management without using an advanced technique the inference method was based on dempster shafer inference a technique close to human perception and reasoning the inference method was supported on agronomic evidence such as soil water deficit which was estimated by monitoring soil moisture and the stomata closure which was indirectly related with environmental data to evaluate the soil and plant water status the simulation carried out to establish the impact of the method on crop yield indicates that the irrigation managed by the method contributed positively to oil palm plot by increasing 27 the production of bunches of fresh fruit since palm farmers do not have many well founded manuals that adequately describe how to grow and manage the crop and frequently have to make decisions based on a limited knowledge base this method could enable the development of decision support systems that can proactively control irrigation according to the plot level agrometeorological conditions also the method has the potential to contribute to yield intensification strategies as oil palm crop expansion in under considerable scrutiny because of related environmental damages furthermore the formulated inference method a new method for local and representative agrometeorological information processing is one of the firsts approaches applied from data fusion to support decision making in the management of oil palm crops moreover it allows that wsns a low cost technology can be better exploited for the collection of information and the search for an added value of the information not to mention that the inference method can be applied to other crops since its formulation is based on generic agronomic evidence which gives it a potential impact beyond the oil palm agroindustry further research compromises including a strategy that indicates the moment in which the irrigation must be deactivated after a yes it is suitable irrigating the plot given by the method the next issue is that the same agrometeorological variables infer when a normal state of the crop has been reached about crop simulation future work refers to gathering more information on the plot regarding the characterization of planting material and soil fertilization operations and historical production of fresh fruit bunches concerning simulated treatments it is necessary to create a third treatment that allows establishing the impact of the method against traditional irrigation management which involves identifying how decisions are currently made and taking this to the simulation for validating the method

11242,in order to achieve optimum yields in oil palm management practices should be tailored to the crop site agro ecological conditions nevertheless oil palm farmers often have to make decisions based on a limited knowledge base considering that water management is a critical aspect of oil palm crops this paper describes an inference method for irrigation decision making in oil palm supported on soil moisture and vapor pressure deficit data under an ideal scenario where this agrometeorological data is available through a wireless sensor network wsn at a crop plot resolution we formulated a method to prevent oil palm farmers to submit their crops to water deficit stress the inference method was based on a data fusion technique called dempster shafer inference which is convenient for the use of uncertain data with distinct levels of detail such as those present in a wsn the outcome of fusing soil moisture and vapor pressure data was inferring the crop state regarding soil and plant water status following the concept of site specific agriculture to evaluate the impact of the method on crop yield we carried out two simulations the first one on a wsns simulator castalia to generate the irrigation decisions according to the site specific agrometeorological data collected from the wsn the second one on a crop simulation model apsim agricultural production systems simulator to simulate the oil palm plot at the study site under two treatments plot with irrigation managed by the inference method and plot without irrigation results from oil palm crop simulation showed a 27 increase in the production of bunches of fresh fruit between 2016 and 2017 in the treatment with irrigation the method has the potential for contributing to irrigation decision support systems and for being useful in yield intensification rather than crop extension politics for oil palm and other crops keywords decision making oil palm data fusion irrigation management wireless sensor networks site

is necessary to tailor weather and climate information to a local level for individual farmers fao 2015 current information is inadequate to support effective decision making and to a considerable

understand the implications of their decisions fao 2010 efforts to close the gap have suggested that if colombian farmers can understand the relationship between weather and climate forecasts with the responses of their crop production they can make better decisions on how to manage their farms loboguerrero et al 2018 in colombia oil palm elaeis guineensis jacq crops are characterized by a population of more than 70 of small scale farmers fedepalma 2015 who have an average yield lower by 7 tons of fresh fruit bunches per hectare compared to large scale farmers fedepalma 2013 the reason is that this group of farmers have low levels of technological adoption which leads to more significant gaps in yield social and environmental terms hinestroza 2018 according to fontanilla et al 2015 thanks to the application of good practices in small scale oil palm cultivations crop yield can increase from 25 to 84 and the net income of one grower per hectare can increase from 33 to 160 per year nevertheless for oil palm there are not many well founded manuals that adequately describe how to grow and manage oil palm crops hence farmers frequently have to make decisions based on a limited knowledge base cock et al 2016 not to mention that to achieve optimum yields in oil palm it is necessary to adopt management practices tailored to the needs of the site which are defined by their particular agro ecological conditions paramananthan 2003 moreover farmers need assistance in managing their oil palm crops since are under pressure of improving their economic and environmental sustainability chapman et al 2018 one opportunity in oil palm is to support irrigation management since water deficit stress is a critical yield limiting factor of oil palm crops carr 2011 corley and tinker 2016 woittiez et al 2017 irrigation management is an important aspect comte et al 2012 especially in areas where precipitation is below 100 mm per month paramananthan 2003 as reported by palat et al 2008 in southern thailand irrigation contributed to yield by increasing the production of fresh fruit bunches by 50 in crops irrigated daily during the dry season moreover improving yield while attending the increasing demand for palm oil based vegetable oils and biofuels oecd fao 2016 without raising crop areas is vital in south east asia oil palm crops and its expansion have been related to the destruction of the tropical forest the loss of biodiversity and the emission of greenhouse gasses fitzherbert et al 2008 koh and wilcove 2008 uusitalo et al 2014 vijay et al 2016 in latin america peru ecuador guatemala and brazil contributed most to deforestation when converting woody vegetation areas to oil palm crops furumo and aide 2017 notably in peru oil palm expansion is a great cause of amazon deforestation and loss of avian diversity bennett et al 2018 gutiérrez vélez et al 2011 srinivas and koh 2016 although in colombia oil palm crops are located mainly in what were formerly pastures and other agricultural areas castiblanco et al 2013 and that there are between 1 3 mha suitable for expansion without incurring in deforestation practices castiblanco et al 2013 upra 2017 or severe threats to biodiversity such as vertebrates ocampo peñuela et al 2018 others studies suggest the need to understand how the conversion of colombian savannas non forested ecosystems likely to be converted into oil palm areas can affect biodiversity in fauna pardo et al 2018 such as the work of lópez ricaurte et al 2017 in avian diversity the purpose of this work was to address the challenge of transforming raw agrometeorological information into accessible understandable and relevant agrometeorological information for decision making hansen and coffey 2011 in the context of oil palm plantations in colombia under an ideal scenario where site specific information is available through wireless sensor networks consequently the aim was to develop and to validate a method that supports decision making for site specific irrigation management under the urgent need for further investigation in irrigation regimes for a wide range of environmental conditions to close yield gaps woittiez et al 2017 this method could enable the development of systems that can proactively control irrigation responding to the plant soil atmosphere system in the future the method could contribute to the intensification of production on existing palm oil plantations oecd fao 2018 as land use change in the tropics has become a prominent topic lópez ricaurte et al 2017 1 1 irrigation decision making in oil palm according to corley and tinker 2016 the decision on when to irrigate requires information on the degree of water deficit stress suffered by the palms a way to estimate the stress is to calculate the soil water deficit which can be solved with agrometeorological information on soil water reserves corley and tinker 2016 by knowing the water retention curve of the crop soil and establishing the water amount points that define water soil dynamics the degree of water deficit stress can be determined as the difference between the volumetric water content soil moisture and the allowable soil water depletion point critical deficit then irrigation should be activated when soil moisture reaches a value below the critical deficit because by that point plant functions such as growth or yield start to be affected corley and tinker 2016 evans et al 1996 nevertheless stress due to water deficit is not only due to low soil water availability the deficit can occur because the stomata are closed due to dry air which is expressed as the vapor pressure difference between the leaf and the atmosphere franks and farquhar 1999 since plants continuously regulate transpiration by controlling the aperture of the stomatal pores on the surface of the leaf a high vapor pressure deficit vpd causes stomata to close while a low vdp causes stomata to open mcadam and brodribb 2015 this relationship between vpd leaf gas exchange and their effects on reducing stomatal conductance has been widely observed in a variety of plant species oren et al 1999 and particularly in oil palm smith 1989 as reported by henson and harun 2005 it has been well characterized in oil palm that vpd exerts a major influence on canopy photosynthesis via its effect on stomatal conductance for instance dufrêne and saugier 1993 reported for oil palm an exponential decrease in stomatal conductance in the vpd range from 1 0 to 4 5 kpa and a linear reduction in the transpiration rate a decrease in photosynthesis when the vpd exceeded 1 8 kpa this latter value was confirmed by henson 1995 estimating that the photosynthesis of the canopy was reduced by half when the vpd increased from 0 8 to 2 0 kpa henson and chang 1990 and kallarackal et al 2004 stated that a vdp value above 1 8 kpa would affect oil palm photosynthesis even under sufficient soil water availability smith 1989 and dufrêne and saugier 1993 stated that it is necessary a vpd value greater than 1 8 kpa for photosynthesis to be affected when palms are under well watered conditions however results in smith 1989 were measured in controlled conditions which are a bit far from the actual circumstances differences between vdp critical value for photosynthesis and stomatal behavior could be originated when using different measurement techniques carr 2011 and different measurement scenarios correlated environmental conditions to have a conservative position on this we decided to select 1 8 kpa as the irrigation decision making inflection point in other words irrigation should not be activated when vpd reaches 1 8 kpa because palms photosynthetic rate begins to be limited 1 2 wireless sensor networks for site specific agriculture over recent years wireless sensor networks wsns have emerged as new sources of observations in agriculture which allows agrometeorological information systems to operate with a variety of cost effective high performance and reliable sensors mirhosseini et al 2017 the general architecture of a wsn consists of a set of autonomous devices spatially deployed which collaboratively collect data on a particular phenomenon and transmit them wirelessly akyildiz et al 2002 culler and hong 2004 yick et al 2008 devices classified as node sensors tens to thousands a sink node and a gateway sensor nodes are responsible for detecting measuring processing and sending the data of the phenomenon under study by multi hop communication to the sink node akyildiz et al 2002 akyildiz and vuran 2010 then the data concentrated in the sink node which has computational capabilities superior to sensor nodes is forwarded to a gateway to transmit it outside the network alternatively data is sent to a base station that is a device directly connected to a computer for dissemination and analysis by providing a new way to observe the crop and its environment ma et al 2011 wsns are already recognized as a powerful technology for the collection and processing of data in the domain of agriculture borgia 2014 especially under the concept of site specific agriculture initially site specific agriculture was used as a synonym of precision agriculture johannsen and carter 2005 and it was defined as the management of crops on a smaller spatial scale than that of the whole crop plant 2001 however these two concepts are currently differentiated jarvis et al 2013 precision agriculture emphasizes crop management at a higher resolution within the plot guided by a factor whereas site specific agriculture guides crop management by the study of the variability between management units under a combination of factors environmental conditions and agricultural management practices cock et al 2011 jarvis et al 2013 jiménez et al 2016 in oil palm crops it is usual to divide plantations into management units according to the biophysical resources regarding climate soil water planting material and age of the crop munévar et al 2011 rubiano 2005 because the differentiated management by crop units has the effect of increasing crop yield garzón et al 2005 romero et al 2008 thus wsns deployed over vast areas observing multiple variables on the plant soil atmosphere system are mean to realize site specific agriculture this is particularly important in developing countries where farmers need to learn how to manage their crops at the plot level rather than refining the management practices of their crops within the plot level cock et al 2011 jiménez et al 2016 experiences in the adoption of site specific management practices from colombian sugarcane farmers have proved an increase in productivity and profitability isaacs et al 2007 this paper describes the development of a method for assisting irrigation decision making in oil palm crops guided by the information provided from a wsn and then uses this method to evaluate in silico its effects on crop yield under the decision support provided 2 material and methods based on the developed concepts above we formulated an inference method for irrigation decision making in oil palm under a scenario where agrometeorological information is available through a wsn also we simulated the method to obtain irrigation decisions with agrometeorological information from one plot of a plantation site in colombia and we simulated the crop performance under the irrigation decisions taken at the first simulation 2 1 study site the agrometeorological data used for the method was based on data from an oil palm plantation located at palmar de la vizcaína experiment field station santander colombia 6 58 n 73 42 w at an altitude of 140 m with average conditions of 75 of relative humidity and 32 c of average daily temperature bayona rodríguez and romero 2016 a plot from the plantation was selected as the study site under the criterium that agrometeorological data was especially available at that level of spatial resolution the datasets from the study site covered a time from august 20th of 2015 to may 31st of 2017 the selected plot has an area of 10 ha with seven years old oil palms which were planted in a triangular distance of 9 m the critical values for irrigation were 30 of soil moisture specifically for the plot soil and 1 8 kpa general for oil palm according to the water retention curve of the soil at the study site data not shown it was established that 30 of soil moisture equals a soil water potential of 0 5 mpa different authors have stated that this soil water potential corresponds to a water deficit event that sustained in time affects the growth and yield of the plant aston and lawlor 1979 jazayeri et al 2015 rivera et al 2012 fig 1 shows an aerial photograph of the plot 2 2 variables for irrigation decision making in oil palm there were identified two variables to manage irrigation decision making soil moisture and vapor pressure deficit the first one advises the necessity to irrigate oil palms while the second one advises the moment to irrigate oil palms by using the measured volumetric water content and the volumetric water content at the critical deficit point we estimated the soil water status moreover by using the measured vapor pressure deficit and the vapor pressure deficit at the photosynthesis declining point we related the stomata conductance to the plant water status with the method we fused the estimation and relation made to infer the irrigation decision from the soil and plant perspective methods to evaluate soil water status commonly refer to soil moisture content measurement and soil water potential measurement jones 2007 methods to directly characterize plant water status often refer to water potential measurement or relative water content measurement whereas indirect methods refer to stomatal conductance measurement stem diameter variations tracking or using sap flow sensor among others giménez et al 2013 for instance in oil palm stomatal conductance is a sensitive indicator of plant water status carr 2011 henson et al 2005 assessed some methods to value soil and plant water status in oil palm crops which included leaf or canopy temperature leaf water potential sap flux evapotranspiration soil water depletion spear leaf accumulation frond production rate inflorescence abortion reduced sex ratio bunch number reduction reduced fruit yield and others bayona rodríguez and romero 2016 used the leaf water potential as an indicator of palm water stress under deficit events to do so they used a schölander pressure chamber the measurements were performed predawn following the protocol established in bayona et al 2007 as the methods to characterize the plant water status can be labor intensive and request for specialized instruments while following measurement protocols we decided to use an approximate approach and keep it simple by using the relation between stomatal conductance and vapor pressure deficit to estimate the palm water status for more information on the association of vapor pressure deficit with stomatal conductance and photosynthesis refer to corley and tinker 2016 carr 2011 henson 1995 and dufrêne and saugier 1993 after identifying these variables for irrigation decision making we assessed how often to make irrigation decisions if it should be done hourly daily weekly or monthly as reported by corley and tinker 2003 the measurement or estimation of water deficit stress per week should be sufficient since evapotranspiration per week is very unlikely to exceed 40 mm and the critical deficit in oil palm is higher than that according to expert advice data should be consolidated every 3rd day first thing in the morning and decide whether to or not to activate the irrigation for oil palms bayona personal communication 2017 for our work we computed data at 6 o clock in the morning however watering should be started between 7 30 and 8 00 a m since stomatal conductance is at its peak in that time kallarackal et al 2004 smith 1989 which will mean a better uptake of water from palms given the fact that adaptive responses in plants to droughts develop over timescales of days to weeks as drought itself water deficit stress measurements for agronomic purposes should be integrated over time and space instead of preferring instantaneous measurements jones 2007 thus for irrigation decision making soil moisture collected from the sensor network is averaged from the previous three days at the term of making an irrigation decision on the other hand plant responses controlled through hormonal signaling are appropriate to be measured instantaneously if directly dependent on local status jones 2007 in angiosperms such as oil palm stomata response to vapor pressure deficit appears to be driven by changes in the foliar concentration of the plant hormone abscisic acid mcadam and brodribb 2015 in consequence the vapor pressure deficit can be estimated under instantaneous environmental conditions and not integrative recordings over time still analysis of continuous records offers a dynamic picture of plant and soil water status and therefore holds promise for increasing the precision of irrigation decision making goldhamer et al 1999 in table 1 we present the management of variables for irrigation decision making in oil palm considering that wsns can be deployed at a representative spatial scale which translates into facilitating and improving the skills of farmers to accessing to data at the local level gutman and robert 2013 wang et al 2006 and that weather and climate conditions tend to show continuous variation without abrupt changes or discontinuities unlike soils that can vary significantly over minimum distances cock et al 2011 we proposed that irrigation decision making in oil palm should be managed at the plot level and a wsn could be deployed per plot to collect soil moisture and vapor pressure data 2 3 specification of agrometeorological data considering that representative agrometeorological data was necessary for the method and that the selected plot did not count with a wsn we used the available data from one source to recreate a scenario from the study site in which agrometeorological information was collected through a wsn the agrometeorological information was obtained from one micrometeorological station biomet 103 associated with an eddy covariance system li cor inc 2011 installed at the plot the station is equipped with sensors that observe the soil plant atmosphere system the sensors make measurements every minute except the wind speed that is measured at a rate of 10 hz as the station is located within the crop it makes representative observations of the microclimate since it intends to monitor and operationally support the local agricultural situation wmo 2010 both soil moisture and vapor pressure deficit data the latter calculated with air temperature and relative humidity data was used to generate datasets since the station is equipped with three stevens hydra probe ii stevens water monitoring systems inc n d sensors of soil moisture and one hmp155 vaisala 2012 sensor of relative humidity and ambient temperature there were created four datasets from the four records of sensors information records from the four sensors amounted to more than 3 7 million data the datasets covered a time from august 20th of 2015 to may 31st of 2017 soil moisture datasets were created from averaging soil moisture over the three days before the time of the irrigation decision every 3rd day at 6 a m according to eq 1 moreover the vapor pressure deficit dataset was created by calculating deficit with data from relative humidity and air temperature at the time of decision 6 a m with eq 2 as such the first register of the datasets corresponds to august 23rd of 2015 at 6 o clock in the morning 2 4 inference method in the method we used the dempster shafer inference technique over other techniques because it provides a formalism to manage data uncertainty by expressing a degree of belief which supports or refutes a hypothesis gros 1997 furthermore it allows combining data from sensors giving distinct levels of detail nakamura et al 2007 on the one hand in a wireless sensor network data comes from sensor nodes which observe physical properties that are continuously evolving in time hence a sensor only gives us a snapshot of that evolution which means that the measurements are not 100 true mitchell 2012 on the other hand according to the irrigation decision making concept presented above the variables that determine the degree of water deficit stress are soil moisture and vapor pressure deficit these variables describe different physical quantities therefore are expressed in different units of measurement and cannot be directly related 2 4 1 dempster shafer inference technique this technique is based on the theory of the accumulation of evidence formulated from the work of dempster 2008 1968 in the understanding and refinement of fisher s approach to the inference of probability which was later formalized by shafer 1996 1992 1976 towards a generalization of the bayesian inference in dempster shafer inference technique farias et al 2014 gros 1997 khaleghi et al 2013 nakamura et al 2007 the θ represents the set of possible states that describe a system θ θ 1 θ n where each element of the set is exclusive in the sense that the system can only be found in a state at a given moment and that the set of 2 θ represents all possible subsets of θ whose elements are the hypotheses the dempster shafer theory assigns the mass function m to each hypothesis h of 2 θ which represents the possible propositions regarding the state of the system according to the mass function m 2 θ 0 1 it is satisfied that the mass function of an empty set is zero 3 m 0 also the mass function of a hypothesis h is greater than or equal to zero 4 m h 0 h 2 θ and the sum of the mass function of all the hypotheses is equal to 1 as 5 h 2 θ m h 1 the confidence interval in a hypothesis h is defined as the range between its belief and its plausibility as bel h pl h which is the true belief about the hypothesis h the belief in a hypothesis h the belief function b e l 2 θ 0 1 over θ is 6 bel h a h m a where bel 1 and bel θ 1 and the doubt in a hypothesis h is expressed according to the belief function as 7 do h bel h a h m a the plausibility of a hypothesis h the plausibility function p l 2 θ 0 1 over θ is defined as 8 pl h 1 do h a h m a to combine the evidence provided by different sources over a hypothesis h there is a combination rule which integrates the effects of two mass functions m 1 and m 2 as 9 m 1 m 2 h a b h m 1 a m 2 b 1 a b m 1 a m 2 b where the combination of mass functions of an empty set is zero 10 m 1 m 2 0 as an advantage the dempster shafer inference technique allows grasping ignorance or an inability to distinguish between possible states so that probabilities over a state are associated only when support information is available in the theory of probability bayesian inference this would be treated in a very different way by assigning an equal or uniform probability to each possible state the use of the discernment framework as the set θ is called allows for a much richer representation of beliefs 2 4 2 inferring irrigation decisions irrigation management is based among other issues on making decisions about whether y e s or n o t to irrigate thus this decision can be reduced to a process of inference about the state of the crop given a set of possible states it is necessary to infer what the actual state of the crop is since it is only needed to water when it is necessary and adequate to irrigate in agreement with the irrigation decision making concept in oil palm the states of the crop can refer to n o r m a l n and c r i t i c a l c the first refers when the plants have sufficient soil moisture or when the environmental conditions are not appropriate of watering and the second refers when the plants have insufficient soil moisture and environmental conditions are optimal for watering thus the discernment framework is the set θ n c and the quantity of hypothesis is 2 θ 2 2 4 being the hypothesis set h θ n c n c the dempster shafer inference technique works with pieces of evidence which are represented by mass functions therefore to formulate the method it was necessary to translate the agrometeorological variables that indicate the need and time of irrigation soil moisture during the last three days and vapor pressure deficit into mass functions to be fused using the dempster shafer combination rule in line with what was reported in section 1 1 on irrigation decision making in oil palm and with the critical values for the plot the mass functions of the method are defined below when soil moisture decreases 0 θ 30 it means that there is a non zero belief that water is needed for the crop also when θ tends to 0 this belief increases therefore to translate θ into evidence we define the mass function m 1 2 θ 0 1 for the hypothesis set as follows 11 m 1 c 1 θ 0 θ 30 0 θ 30 m 1 n 1 m 1 c m 1 n c 0 m 1 0 the above means that soil moisture establishes a state c r i t i c a l of a need for irrigation when soil moisture is less than 30 n o r m a l of no need for irrigation complementary to the critical state when the soil moisture is greater than or equal to 30 and that the hypothesis of n c has a mass equal to 0 since soil moisture during the last three days cannot define a state of non belief on n o r m a l n or c r i t i c a l c moreover when the vapor pressure deficit decreases v p d 1 8 k p a means that there is a non zero belief that it is appropriate to irrigate the crop also when v p d tends to 0 this belief increases therefore to translate v p d into evidence we define the mass function m 2 2 θ 0 1 for the hypothesis set as follows 12 m 2 c 1 v p d 1 8 w v p d 1 8 0 v p d 1 8 m 2 n 1 m 2 c m 2 n c 0 m 2 0 where w 1 75 this weight is given to m 2 c with the goal that the belief assigned by this mass has a smaller impact on the decision of irrigation the reason is that this weight softens the response of the method at estimating a c r i t i c a l state by the moment factor because the need factor must be more decisive in the management of irrigation according to the mass function due to vapor pressure deficit a state is established c r i t i c a l of a right moment for irrigation when the vapor pressure deficit is less than 1 8 kpa n o r m a l of a no right moment for irrigation complementary to the critical state when the vapor pressure deficit is greater than or equal to 1 8 kpa and that the hypothesis of n c has a mass equal to 0 because the vapor pressure deficit cannot define a state of nonbelief about n o r m a l n or c r i t i c a l c to estimate the state of the crop that decides whether or not irrigation should be activated i the beliefs assigned by m 1 and m 2 are combined using the dempster shafer combination rule ii the belief and plausibility of each hypothesis n o r m a l n and c r i t i c a l c con are calculated with respect to m 1 m 2 iii the most plausible state is chosen if both states are equally plausible the most credible is chosen if both states are equally plausible and credible the n o r m a l n state is chosen finally if it is inferred that the state of the crop is c r i t i c a l c the decision is that y e s it is suitable irrigating the plot on the contrary if it is inferred that the state of the crop is n o r m a l n the decision is that n o it is not suitable irrigating the plot 2 5 inference method simulation the proposed method was simulated assuming as the simulation scenario the oil palm plot with a wsn deployed to acquire local and representative data from the crop the wns data was recreated from the datasets generated on soil moisture and vapor pressure deficit from the plot at the study site for the simulation castalia program was used this is an open source simulator for wireless sensor networks and body area networks which is widely used in the academic and research community pediaditakis et al 2010 because it allowed the simulation of the wsn with the inference method and the recreation of physical processes in a very flexible way castalia was used in its version 3 2 boulis 2011 running on omnet in its version 4 4 1 opensim ltd 2014 table 2 summarizes the main configurations made for the simulation in this work a square area corresponding to the plot was recreated with a wsn deployed the network counted with 72 sensor nodes organized in a grid of 9 8 and connected in a tree topography by the routing protocol of gnawali et al 2009 since soil moisture varies in space much more than air temperature and relative humidity the first variable is conditioned by factors such as soil type and topography whereas the second and third variables are widely established in the atmosphere for the plot the 72 sensor nodes in the simulation were arranged to monitor the variable behavior of soil moisture in the plot while only one sensor node was arranged to monitor the air temperature and relative humidity to calculate the vapor pressure deficit also a physical process module was configured in castalia to recreate the soil moisture behavior with the three soil moisture datasets transformed into three information sources this module is based on a model in which an arbitrary number of information sources influence is diffused over space boulis 2011 in castalia an information source is a string of snapshots each snapshot describes time s position x m position y m and value of the physical property the three datasets created from the soil moisture sensors were organized into three strings of snapshots since the sensors at the micrometeorological station are static that is position x and position y are fixated but we had to recreate the soil moisture in the entire 10 ha plot a fictitious location was defined for each snapshot with random numbers within the area of deployment thus each soil moisture snapshot was located at a new point in the plot the measurement of each sensor node over a physical property was defined by eq 13 boulis 2011 which implies that a measurement keeps a spatial correlation with all information sources because the effect of multiple sources is additive each soil moisture measurement is the sum of the values provided by the three information sources consequently to avoid multiplying the soil moisture measurements by three the soil moisture values at the datasets were divided into three when creating the strings of snapshots 13 v p t a l l s o u r c e s i v i t k d i p t 1 a n 0 σ where v p t value of the physical process at point p at time t vi t value of the ith source at time t di p t distance of point p from the ith source at time t k a are parameters that determine how is the value from a source diffused n 0 σ is a zero mean gaussian random variable with standard deviation σ the p point is the location of the sensor node within the deployment area which in this case is related to the deployment in the grid of 9 8 the parameters k a and σ are configurable in the module it was defined k 0 and a 1 then the division factor is 1 and the value defined by the information source is maintained and σ 0 2 to introduce the lowest noise in the measurements and keep them as faithful as possible to the real soil moisture data before using the 72 sensor nodes as data sources whose information was translated into beliefs with the method the plot was divided into three zones hence the soil moisture measurements were consolidated by zone consequently the set of sensor nodes was divided into three subsets each related to a zone and their measurements were averaged in the end for the inference method applied every 3rd day at 6 in the morning four values entered three average soil moisture values an average for each zone and one value from vapor pressure deficit based on these values the estimation of the soil water status and the relation of stomatal conductance to plant water status were used to infer irrigation decisions at the crop plot 2 6 oil palm yield simulation the irrigation decisions derived from the inference method were translated into irrigation operations in a modeling framework to evaluate its impact on crop yield in this way the plot at the study site was taken to simulation to compare two irrigation treatments namely plot with irrigation managed by the inference method and plot without irrigation for the simulation of the oil palm plot the agricultural production systems simulator apsim software was used the apsim model for oil palm was developed by huth et al 2014 and we used it for our crop simulation the model uses widely tested submodels for the water carbon and nutrient cycle and based on these makes predictions of oil palm growth and crop yield per unit area nelson et al 2015a it simulates the growth of leaves stem root and fresh fruit bunches in response to inputs which are mainly data from the daily weather report soil information and crop management practices also the model estimates the use of resources and the flow of organic matter for the palm okoro et al 2017 considering that huth et al 2014 parametrized and tested the model based on data from three sites in papua new guinea we adapted the model to the data available of the study site in colombia for this simulation two treatments were compared plot with irrigation and plot without irrigation with the same input data except the first treatment which included irrigation operations derived from the decisions of the inference method while the second did not include irrigation operations the primary resources used for the simulation are described below 2 6 1 daily weather report data the climate variables used for the simulation were solar radiation mj m2 maximum temperature c minimum temperature c and precipitation mm since the simulation requires this data from year 1 of sowing which for the case of the plot is 2011 it was necessary to use data from a weather station of the national institute of hydrology meteorology and environmental studies known as ideam installed in the study site the daily weather records go from january 1st of 2011 to december 31st of 2017 2 6 2 soil data because comprehensive soil information about the plot at the study site was not available the soil data of the oil palm crop in sangara at papua new guinea huth et al 2014 was used this site has a sandy clay loam of soil type as stated by huth et al 2014 while the application of the apsim oil palm model is promising the availability of crucial data is likely to restrict its use from the lessons of the model building authors recognize that the parameterization of soil models was a difficulty because of information lacking hence they resorted to a variety of information sources in our case we had restrictive soil data and decided to run the simulation based on sangara conditions in okoro et al 2017 as authors had some information on soil soil texture and soil volumetric water content all other soil parameters were taken from huth et al 2014 nevertheless there are methods to address information uncertainty which will require us further work in gathering soil information if we want the irrigation method to be available for decision making by farmers and managers fundamental work on the matter is reported by nelson et al 2015b which presents a transect based method for monitoring soil properties in oil palm plantations over time some specific changes to sangara characteristics of the soil water phase are indicated in table 3 2 6 3 crop management data in the case of fertilization at the plot table 4 presents the fertilization operations entered in the simulation model this information was recreated from factual information on fertilizers dates and quantities applied in the years 2016 and 2017 for the previous years there was no information available also only the fertilizers that provide nitrogen were considered since the model only takes into account the cycle of this nutrient in the growth and development of oil palm moreover in the case of irrigation for the treatment of plot with irrigation irrigation operations were created between august 20th of 2015 to may 31st of 2017 according to the decisions resulting from the application of the inference method in the first simulation the decision to y e s it is suitable irrigating the plot resulted in the application of 15 mm of water whereas the decision to n o it is not suitable irrigating the plot resulted in the application of 0 mm of water considering that the irrigation events were decided every 3rd day a level of water of 15 mm is sufficient to compensate the evapotranspiration in that period if it was necessary to water the reason is that in general it is considered that the evapotranspiration of the adult palm crop is of the order of 5 mm day 1 or 150 mm m 1 as reviewed by carr 2011 studies report transpiration rates in oil palm plantations from 3 3 to 6 5 mm day 1 in the dry season and 1 3 3 8 mm day 1 on the rainy season also it is estimated that in months with 10 or less rainy days the evapotranspiration is 150 mm m 1 and that in months with 11 or more days of rain is 120 mm m 1 according to the irho method for calculating the water deficit bakoumé et al 2013 keong and keng 2012 palat et al 2008 according to the estimated evapotranspiration for the oil palm plantation where the plot is located during august 20th of 2015 to may 31st of 2017 values between 11 and 17 mm were reported for three cumulative days the fao penman monteith equation was used to calculate the reference crop evapotranspiration eto and the crop evapotranspiration under standard conditions etc was calculated using a crop coefficient kc of 0 9 as a value between the range indicated for oil palm by henson 1995 3 results and discussion this section presents results on the inference method and its simulation for irrigation management with the available agrometeorological information of the plot 3 1 inference technique according to bouma 1997 a challenge for science is to create methods that can characterize the spatiotemporal variability of crops in favor that farmers can use the information effectively to improve their management practices thus there are required ways to bring raw information to accessible understandable and relevant information for decision making hansen and coffey 2011 to address the challenge we formulated the method using a technique from data fusion a discipline that includes the application of techniques to support human or automated decision making boström et al 2007 data fusion gros 1997 and specifically multisensor data fusion hall and llinas 1997 varshney 2000 is a set of techniques that combine data from multiple sensors to provide higher value to information than the one that could be achieved using a single sensor the definition of higher value can refer to the obtaining of higher precision estimation description or quality of the information the synergistic combination of data from sensors allows us to make inferences about information hence improving the performance of a task by better understanding the current situation and better supporting decisions nakamura et al 2007 inference techniques in data fusion are often applied to obtain decisions on the knowledge of the perceived situation which is provided by many sources inference refers to a transition from a proposition that is probably true to verification of its veracity farias et al 2014 nakamura et al 2007 there are several techniques within the data fusion for the realization of inferences nakamura et al 2007 among the most outstanding are the bayesian inference the dempster shafer inference and the fuzzy logic in the method we used the dempster shafer inference technique over other techniques because it provides a formalism to manage data uncertainty gros 1997 and allows combining data from sensors giving distinct levels of detail nakamura et al 2007 on the one hand in a wireless sensor network data comes from sensor nodes which observe physical properties that are continuously evolving in time hence a sensor only gives us a snapshot of that evolution which means that the measurements are not 100 true since the sensor provides an estimate of the measured physical property mitchell 2012 besides sensor nodes are numerous devices that can fail abdelgawad and bayoumi 2012 kulkarni et al 2011 luo and kay 1989 nakamura et al 2007 which supposes errors in the measurements of the parameters and vulnerability to faults abdelgawad and bayoumi 2012 on the other hand according to the irrigation decision making concept presented above the variables that determine the degree of water deficit stress are soil moisture and vapor pressure deficit these variables describe different physical quantities therefore are expressed in different units of measurement and cannot be directly related nevertheless as explained their integration is a synergy that helps to understand the soil plant atmosphere relationship better and to establish water deficit of oil palms to execute irrigation 3 2 inference method for irrigation management for practically defining irrigation scheduling farmers have conventional methods that aim to maintain soil water close to or above field capacity this by making a direct measurement of soil moisture content or by the use of soil water balance calculations jones 2013 to these practices in oil palm are reported by lascano 1998 nevertheless because of soils heterogeneity the use of stand alone instruments that offer single point measurements are not adequate since data is not representative jones 2007 nor the estimation of soil moisture content is sufficient since it is subject to cumulative errors and depends on a good definition of crop coefficients jones 2013 an example of irrigation management for oil palm based on potential evapotranspiration estimations can be found on mejía et al 2006 also there are methods for irrigation scheduling based on the plant water status but are more restrictive because are labor intensive and often require specialized training and equipment jones 2013 here we proposed an inference method that combined some advantages of conventional and plant based methods and that addressed some of their limitations by directly measuring soil water content and estimating stomatal closure first the method used soil moisture data from multiple sensors deployed in a network which collected representative data on the soil water status from a crop plot second the method used the vapor pressure deficit as an indirect indicator of the plant water status regarding stomatal aperture by doing this we have a method appropriate for irrigation decision making supported on direct and indirect measurements of the soil plant atmosphere system which attends the crop water requirement for each geographical location this is particularly important for oil palm since the water requirement is relatively unknown kallarackal et al 2004 3 3 irrigation decisions for the irrigation decisions simulation in a crop plot scenario with a wsn castalia program was used this is an open source simulator for wireless sensor networks and body area networks which is widely used in the academic and research community pediaditakis et al 2010 according to its creators pham et al 2007 the reason for creating castalia is that before there was not a simulator that could recreate precise communication models wireless channels and radio models and that was also reliable and fast given this need castalia was ideally suited for the design and validation of algorithms and protocols in addition to being relatively easy to use pediaditakis et al 2010 the main reason for using castalia in this work was that it allowed the simulation of the wsn and the inference method indifferent of a particular wsn platform and also allowed the recreation of physical processes in a very flexible way the results from the simulation are presented here as the relationship between the average soil moisture and the vapor pressure deficit with the decisions taken figs 2 8 depict the averages of soil moisture the vapor pressure deficit and the irrigation decision taken by date the left vertical axis is the percentage of soil moisture and the right vertical axis is the vapor pressure deficit in kpa and the decision taken for the latter a 1 value means y e s to irrigate and a 0 value means n o to irrigate thus for example in fig 2 for october 10th of 2015 the soil moisture averages were below 25 the steam pressure deficit was 0 kpa and the decision was y e s to irrigate on octuber 13th of 2015 the soil moisture averages were above 30 the vapor pressure deficit was 0 kpa and the decision was n o to irrigate as observed in the figures that the three averages of soil moisture were below 30 ensured that the decision made was y e s to irrigate here the question that arose was about what is the incidence of vapor pressure deficit in the irrigation decisions according to the agrometeorological information received from the study site the vapor pressure deficit at 6 o clock in the morning never exceeded 0 4315 kpa march 31st of 2016 that is at that time the deficit always inferred a critical state of the crop and supported a positive irrigation decision while critical values of vapor pressure deficit greater than or equal to 1 8 kpa were only reached between 1 30 p m and 10 45 p m in the study site if the irrigation decision were made between those hours the vapor pressure deficit would have real competition in the irrigation decision making process overall the time lapse in which the crop was inferred in a n o r m a l state was greater than the time lapse when the crop was inferred in a c r i t i c a l state for example throughout period 5 fig 6 enough soil moisture was maintained for crop growth and crop yield thus ensuring a permanent n o r m a l state the periods with the most marked dry seasons were 1 2 3 and 6 figs 2 4 and 7 where at least half of the time the crop was in a c r i t i c a l state on the other hand periods 4 and 7 figs 5 and 8 were dominated by seasons marked with soil moisture above the critical value 30 which are most likely related to rainy seasons inclusively in the figures it can be recognized that the decisions of y e s to irrigate were persistent between the months of december to march april which are summer months for the colombian region where the study site is located in fact according to lascano 1998 this region usually suffers a dry season between november to april that affects crop yield the averages of the soil moisture measurements recreated from the three datasets varied from 10 to 45 meanwhile the records of the three sensors varied from 6 to 65 this indicates that the agrometeorological information of the micrometeorological station was useful at representing a wsn monitoring the plot however the ideal scenario to validate the inference method for irrigation management would be one in which a wsn monitors the plot whose measurements are subject to uncertainty and where the dempster shafer technique helps manage the inaccurate data derived from it one more question that arose was decided y e s to irrigate when to stop watering the deactivation of irrigation was not addressed in the inference method since the primary purpose was to decide whether to water or not in general in irrigation systems this issue is handled in two ways by time or by a condition that is the irrigation is stopped after a pre defined time or the irrigation is stopped when a variable reaches a condition in the work of amaral teles et al 2016 palm oil crops are irrigated with micro sprinkler every 4th day for four hours during the summer season in works on irrigation management systems supported by wsns deactivation strategies differ for example in gutierrez jaguey et al 2015 and mitralexis and goumopoulos 2015 irrigation stops after a predetermined time moreover in coates et al 2013 mafuta et al 2013 and sales et al 2015 irrigation is stopped when it is satisfied a conditional value bearing in mind that irrigation management is optimal if it is based on data collected in real time it is estimated as a future work of the method to establish a deactivation strategy that includes increasing the sampling frequency of soil moisture and vapor pressure deficit while irrigation is active and stopping irrigation if a threshold value to be determined of soil moisture is reached or if the critical value of the vapor pressure deficit is reached 1 8 kpa 3 4 oil palm yield for the simulation of the oil palm plot the agricultural production systems simulator apsim software was used this program offers a modeling framework for agricultural and livestock systems developed with high standards from science and software engineering internationally recognized apsim initiative n d holzworth et al 2014 the results from the simulation are presented here as the relationship between precipitation irrigation decisions and crop yield for the two scenarios with irrigation and without irrigation fig 9 presents the annual crop yield reported by apsim regarding precipitation irrigation water and fertilization at the plot the left vertical axis is the crop yield in tons of fresh fruit bunches ffb per hectare per year moreover the right vertical axis is the water level in millimeters of annual precipitation and irrigation also the right vertical axis is the amount of fertilizer applied in kilograms per hectare per year for instance in 2015 the precipitation was 3386 mm year 1 the irrigation was 360 mm year 1 for the scenario with irrigation the fertilization was 0 kg ha 1 year 1 and the crop yield for the two scenarios with irrigation and without irrigation was 4 tffb ha 1 year 1 in fig 10 the same results are presented monthly the left vertical axis and the right vertical axis refer to the same units in fig 33 but per month hence for example for march of 2016 the precipitation was 182 mm month 1 the irrigation was 150 mm month 1 for the scenario with irrigation the fertilization was 0 kg ha 1 month 1 and crop yield for the scenario with irrigation was 30 tffb ha 1 month 1 and for the scenario without irrigation was 26 tffb ha 1 month 1 as shown in fig 9 and as reported by goh 2000 paramananthan 2003 and paramananthan et al 2000 regarding the climatic suitability classification for oil palm productivity the year 2016 had an inadequate aptitude as low precipitations occurred on the other hand the other years were in the adequate range when having annual precipitations from 1700 up to 3000 mm year 1 except for the year 2015 which exceeded 3300 mm year 1 that is it was a moderately suitable year of productivity hence it calls attention that this year was applied 360 mm year 1 of water for irrigation while for the years 2016 and 2017 the water used for irrigation was justified since these years had precipitations below 2000 mm year 1 in other words years with slightly limited precipitation for productivity to better understand what happened in the last three years 2015 2016 and 2017 fig 10 presents received precipitation and irrigation applied monthly although the year 2015 far exceeded the adequate annual amount of precipitation in reality the rainfalls focused on the first half of the year the second semester of 2015 had comparatively less rainfall and was also the time from which irrigation decisions begin to be made by the inference method august 20th of 2015 which is why the application of water for irrigation is observed from that moment on with respect to 2016 this was a crucial year for the implementation of irrigation because it had precipitations below 1000 mm year 1 in total in 2016 645 mm year 1 of irrigation water was applied an amount higher than 2017 when 270 mm year 1 was applied taking into account that not only the annual amount of precipitation is essential but the distribution of the same with a minimum monthly requirement of 100 mm month 1 paramananthan 2003 moreover taking into account that soil moisture was one of the agrometeorological variables from which the irrigation decisions of the inference method were derived which is mainly determined by the climate in the two or three previous months cock et al 2016 it can be better understood that in the second half of 2016 despite the low precipitations no more water was applied for irrigation and that the low water reserves in soil began until the beginning of 2017 likewise it can be better understood that although the year 2015 had greater precipitations than 2017 3386 mm year 1 and 1857 mm year 1 respectively in the former more water was applied for irrigation than in the latter initially in 2015 as already mentioned the rains were more intense in the first semester than in the second semester whereas in 2017 precipitations were better distributed throughout the year that is soil moisture was more stable and that ensured a lower number of positive irrigation decisions besides irrigation decisions only operated until may 31st of 2017 only agrometeorological information of the plot was available to this day and therefore no more water was accumulated for irrigation that year on fertilization it was evident in figs 9 and 10 that only fertilizing operations were carried out between may of 2016 and december of 2017 with an annual application of around 400 kg ha 1 year 1 from year 1 to year 5 no fertilization operations were recorded according to the information provided on the plot worryingly enough the recommended range for nitrogen the only nutrient considered by the crop model for immature palms can range from 48 to 90 kg ha 1 year 1 bessou et al 2017 choo et al 2011 while in mature palms it can range from 56 to 191 kg ha 1 year 1 foster 2003 without considering that the application of fertilization is particular to each cultivation site caliman et al 2004 and in that sense the application rate should be adjusted to the soil conditions of the plot still according to mosquera et al 2017 fertilization participates in the costs of maintenance of the crop since year 1 and is in fact the cost of greater participation in the cultivation of oil palm then it is believed that the lack of information on fertilization is due to a lack of record and not to an absence of fertilizers in the crop what is certain is that the lack of information on fertilization in the simulation model from year 1 to year 5 2011 to 2015 affected the predicted crop yield moreover this introduces the uncertainty of how much the fertilization factor led to a delay and a decrease in the production of fresh fruit bunches to provide further reliability to the predictions on the crop outcomes more information about fertilization should be gathered regarding the projected crop yield in the plot under the two treatments although water for irrigation begins to be applied in august of 2015 it was from january 2016 when differences were marked in favor of the scenario with irrigation the reason is that the fructification in palm oil is continuous then there are always delayed effects of soil water deficit in yield carr 2011 and also delayed effects of irrigation on yield knowing that losses in crop yield depend on when the deficit occurs concerning the stage of development of the inflorescence turner 1977 it is established that the same happens with yield gains due to irrigation when observing the period between december of 2015 and march of 2016 figs 3 and 4 as a time of water deficit soil moisture below 30 and observing march and april of 2017 fig 10 as the months with the greatest yield differences between the two treatments the delay in the effect of drought and irrigation on yield was even more evident in these months yield differences of 18 4 t ha 1 month 1 and 16 8 t ha 1 month 1 between treatments were reached however as reported by turner 1977 the effects of drought on yield occur 21 26 months later by classification the study site has suitable climatic conditions for oil palm productivity except for the year 2016 which was a year impacted by the el niño climate phenomenon according to the drought reported between the end of 2015 and the beginning of 2016 madr 2016 2015 this suitability means that in the study site the benefit of irrigation is discreet compared to that which could be established in places with more marked and extensive dry periods which does happen in plantations located in northern colombian region where the dry period usually extends between november to july lascano and munévar 2000 as expected the simulation estimated a higher crop yield for the plot under irrigation treatment which demonstrates the usefulness of the inference method in supporting decision making plus the positive impact on crop management due to the inference method between treatments as shown in fig 9 in 2016 the estimated yield difference was 4 6 t ha 1 year 1 and for 2017 was 12 7 t ha 1 year 1 this resulted in a 27 increase in the production of bunches of fresh fruit between 2016 and 2017 which allows us to affirm that the method has impact potential for the palm agroindustry in colombia and in other countries where the oil palm also develops 4 conclusions the challenge of bringing raw information to accessible understandable and relevant information for decision making was addressed in this work under an ideal scenario where agrometeorological information was available through a wsn at an oil palm plot we formulated an inference method to assist decision making for irrigation management without using an advanced technique the inference method was based on dempster shafer inference a technique close to human perception and reasoning the inference method was supported on agronomic evidence such as soil water deficit which was estimated by monitoring soil moisture and the stomata closure which was indirectly related with environmental data to evaluate the soil and plant water status the simulation carried out to establish the impact of the method on crop yield indicates that the irrigation managed by the method contributed positively to oil palm plot by increasing 27 the production of bunches of fresh fruit since palm farmers do not have many well founded manuals that adequately describe how to grow and manage the crop and frequently have to make decisions based on a limited knowledge base this method could enable the development of decision support systems that can proactively control irrigation according to the plot level agrometeorological conditions also the method has the potential to contribute to yield intensification strategies as oil palm crop expansion in under considerable scrutiny because of related environmental damages furthermore the formulated inference method a new method for local and representative agrometeorological information processing is one of the firsts approaches applied from data fusion to support decision making in the management of oil palm crops moreover it allows that wsns a low cost technology can be better exploited for the collection of information and the search for an added value of the information not to mention that the inference method can be applied to other crops since its formulation is based on generic agronomic evidence which gives it a potential impact beyond the oil palm agroindustry further research compromises including a strategy that indicates the moment in which the irrigation must be deactivated after a yes it is suitable irrigating the plot given by the method the next issue is that the same agrometeorological variables infer when a normal state of the crop has been reached about crop simulation future work refers to gathering more information on the plot regarding the characterization of planting material and soil fertilization operations and historical production of fresh fruit bunches concerning simulated treatments it is necessary to create a third treatment that allows establishing the impact of the method against traditional irrigation management which involves identifying how decisions are currently made and taking this to the simulation for validating the method and for presenting farmers the potential crop performance under site specific irrigation management acknowledgments we thank all partners within the center of excellence and adoption on the internet

gorham et al 2010 the extent of damage to plants depends not only on salt concentration and toxicity level but also on the specific sensitivity of the plant species that may vary with the phenological

their attention on the effect of salinity on ornamental shrub and bush species completely neglecting them in spite of their wide range of tolerance levels since many of them are naturally occurring in coastal areas and have evolved peculiar combinations of structural and physiological traits to cope with drought salinity and high solar irradiation stresses tattini et al 2002 2006 therefore they provide interesting models to be studied because they would not only provide relevant additional information on general stress tolerance mechanisms in plants but also furnish know how on their

under sprinkle irrigation with reused water with a salinity level around 2 0 ds m 1 devitt et al 2005 cassaniti et al 2012 could make this salt tolerant ornamental shrub a potential candidate in revegetation projects in arid and degraded land landscaping projects and public areas navarro et al 2007 2008 the degree of adaptation of a species to a major abiotic stress such as drought could also be affected by the canopy shape as demonstrated earlier by cirillo et al 2014 2017 which proved that plants can modify the growth behavior and anatomical hydraulic properties depending on the canopy shape training and irrigation level based on these considerations the aim of this study was to investigate morphological physiological and biochemical changes in b spectabilis alexandra irrigated with

minitab 16 2 1 statistical software ciarmiello et al 2015 rouphael et al 2017b 3 results 3 1 morphological and physiological parameters the shoot biomass in particular leaf and stem dry weight as well as the number of leaves per plant decreased only under severe s80 salt stress conditions table 1 for instance irrespective of canopy shape treatments leaf and stem dry weight as well as the number of leaves were significantly reduced by 37 2 37 4 and 30 1 in s80 compared to non saline control treatment s1 moreover the root dry weight was significantly lowered by 21 3 and 31 1 in s40 and s80 treatments respectively compared to the control treatment with no significant difference between the two saline treatments table 1 averaged over saline water treatments dry weight of both stem and roots resulted lower in the gsh plants table 1 furthermore there was also a decrease of leaf dry weight 37 2 and total leaf area 33 9 in s40 gsh compared to the pyramid shaped psh plants tables 1 and 2 the total above ground dry weight shoot biomass cumulative pruning dry weight produced by the plants during the growing cycle was influenced by salinity and canopy shape but not by their interaction table 1 the increased salinity induced a significant and linear decrease of the total above ground dry weight whereas the gsh plants showed a significantly lower amount 14 9 of produced dry biomass during the entire growing cycle table 1 under moderate salt stress conditions s40 psh bougainvillea plants exhibited more leaves and flowers 35 8 and 82 8 respectively compared to gsh plants whereas no significant effects between the two shapes were observed at s80 table 1 both saline water and canopy shape significantly affected the flower brightness l only s80 treatment yielded darker flower expressed by decreasing l values with no significant difference between globe and pyramide trained plants table 1 except for transpiration rate which was affected by water salinity canopy shape interaction with the highest values recorded in psh plants under control treatment the physiological measurements in particular the net photosynthetic rate pn stomatal conductance gs and intrinsic water use efficiency wuei were only influenced by water salinity when averaged over canopy shape treatments increasing the nacl concentration in the irrigation water reduced pn by 20 2 and 27 8 for s40 and s80 respectively and gs by 33 7 and 45 5 for s40 and s80 respectively in comparison to the control treatment with no significant differences between the two water saline treatments s40 and s80 our results also showed that s80 elicited significant increase 30 8 of wuei compared to non saline treatment whereas s40 exhibited intermediate values table 2 the spad index incurred significant water salinity canopy shape interaction whereas ψl and ψπ were influenced by water salinity and canopy shape with no significant water salinity shape interaction table 2 increasing the nacl concentration in the irrigation water from 1 to 80 mm decreased the greenness readings i e spad index with the lowest values recorded in psh plants supplied with 80 mm nacl table 2 when averaged over canopy shape the ψl decreased as the water salinity level increased by 50 5 and 165 9 in s40 and s80 respectively whereas the ψπ was lowered only under severe salt stress conditions table 2 when averaged over water salinity treatments the ψl and ψp in pyramid trained plants were respectively lower than those in globe trained plants table 2 among the biochemical parameters measured the photochemical quenching qp maximum quantum efficiency of psii photochemistry fv fm as well as linear electron transport rate etr were significantly affected by water salinity canopy shape interaction whereas the quantum yield of psii electron transport qy and non photochemical quenching npq were mainly influenced by canopy shape and to a lesser degree only npq by water salinity table 3 for instance the highest values of fv fm and etr were recorded in psh bougainvillea plants grown under non saline conditions table 3 s80 elicited significant increase 57 2 of npq compared to non saline treatment whereas s40 exhibited intermediate values table 3 finally when averaged over water salinity the highest qy was recorded in gsh plants whereas an opposite trend was observed for npq table 3 3 2 leaf functional anatomical traits in bougainvillea leaves stomatal frequency was significantly influenced by the water salinity canopy shape interaction with the highest value recorded in globe trained plants supplied with non salt control treatment and the lowest value measured in globe shape bougainvillea supplied with 80 mm of nacl table 4 similarly to stomatal frequency stomata size guard cell length gcl and guard cell width gcw were both affected by the water salinity shape interaction with the highest and lowest values recorded in pyramid trained plants with 1 mm and 80 mm nacl respectively table 4 although irrigating with saline water as well as canopy shape did not affect the tissue organization of bougainvillea leaves from a quantitative viewpoint there were significant differences in most analyzed parameters table 5 for instance the thickness of palisade and spongy parenchyma tpp and tsp tissues were influenced by both factors water salinity and shape table 5 in psh plants palisade and spongy parenchyma tissues respectively increased by 24 1 at s40 and by 13 at s80 and decreased according to increasing salinity already in s40 plants by 13 5 in gsh plants the increase of palisade parenchyma was significant only at the highest level of salinity 37 1 while an increase in spongy tissue thickness was evident only in s40 plants 19 4 increasing salinity in irrigation water from 1 mm to 80 mm determined an increase in the percentage of intercellular spaces which was also higher in gsh than psh plants table 5 moreover the volume of the cell occupied by the vacuole in the spongy parenchyma vcs decreased according to increasing water salinity by 11 8 and 18 3 in s40 and s80 respectively and was also higher in psh than gsh bougainvillea table 5 salinity significantly decreased the number of chloroplasts in the palisade parenchyma already in similar extent in both s40 and s80 gsp by 21 in both tissues gsh plants were characterized by higher chloroplasts frequency than psh plants table 5 crystals of calcium oxalate were evidenced by polarized light microscopy in leaf lamina of plants in all treatments for instance the number of crystals per surface unit was significantly influenced by the water salinity shape interaction whereas the crystal size was only affected by the salinity treatment table 5 in fact increasing salinity in irrigation water from 1 to 80 mm reduced both the number and the size of crystals with no significant differences between s40 and s80 finally a sharp reduction in the number of crystals was observed in both bougainvillea canopy shapes at s80 and in gsh plants supplied with s40 whereas the crystals number was not affected by s40 when bougainvillea was trained to a pyramid shape table 5 3 3 ions content and partitioning sodium na and chloride cl contents in leaves stem and roots occurred in increasing pattern with increasing external water salinity the highest concentrations of toxic ions being found in leaves and in particular in those from s80 treated plants table 6 under s40 and s80 na and cl concentrations in leaves increased by 16 8 34 fold and 6 3 17 2 fold respectively compared to non salt control showing the maximum relative increase in ion levels and the maximum concentration in psh plants at s80 the gsh and psh plants accumulated in similar manner na and cl with the only exception in s80 psh plants that accumulated a concentration of cl that was 1 55 fold higher than that of na and almost double compared to the cl in gsh bougainvillea plants these latter were able in general to accumulate less na and cl in roots than psh plants under s80 treatment while they did not differ significantly under moderate stress condition s40 the total n in leaves was negatively affected by salt stress treatment especially with s80 whereas an opposite trend was observed in roots table 7 the gsh treatment averaged over water salinity levels affected the n concentration in leaf tissue which was higher than in psh trained bougainvillea table 7 phosphate po4 3 was significantly higher in all tissues of gsh plants than in psh ones but it did not decrease under salinity table 7 potassium k concentration was higher in stems and roots of gsh than in psh plants it decreased in stems and roots as the external salinity increased getting a 30 maximum decrease at s80 table 7 leaves showed a milder decrease of k by around 7 and 6 in s40 and s80 respectively but when considering the interaction between the main factors water salinity canopy shape k did not decrease in psh and only slightly in gsh plants k na ratio was higher in stem and roots of gsh than in psh plants the decrease of k na ratio in relation to the non stressed control was higher in leaves than in stem and roots according to the lower levels of na retained in these plant tissue and notwithstanding the stronger k decrease furthermore leaf k na ratio decreased to a final value corresponding to 5 4 and 2 7 of the initial value in s40 and s80 treatments respectively table 7 the concentration of calcium ca2 was significantly affected only by salinity and it also decreased in leaves and roots on average 37 and 23 respectively table 7 similarly to the monovalent cation magnesium mg2 concentration was higher in roots of gsh than in psh plants mainly at s80 it decreased by 33 on average in all tissues of plants supplied with 40 and 80 mm nacl table 7 the statistical analysis of the na and cl concentrations among the different parts of bougainvillea plants indicated that both toxic ions reached the highest concentration in leaves 13 0 and 15 5 g kg 1 dw for na and cl respectively compared to stem 5 7 and 3 6 g kg 1 dw for na and cl respectively and roots 6 3 and 3 3 g kg 1 dw for na and cl respectively data not shown 3 4 leaf osmolality bougainvillea sap osmolality was 993 and 801 mosmol kg 1 in leaves of pyramid and globe trained plants respectively however the sap osmolality increased after the addition of nacl in irrigation water reaching a value of 21 and 52 higher than the control in both pyramid and globe under 40 and 80 mm nacl respectively table 8 the relative contribution of the main inorganic ions to osmolality was on average 25 35 and 45 for non salt control s40 and s80 treatments respectively in particular in psh plants the relative ion contribution towards osmolality increased from 1 to 17 for both cl and na while in gsh bougainvillea it increased from 2 to 11 and from 1 to 16 for cl and na respectively on the contrary the k contribution towards osmolality decreased under salinity from 21 to 13 in psh plants and from 25 to 14 in the gsh ones table 8 according to puniran hartley et al 2014 it is might be possible that other ions and metabolites present in the cell might have contribute to osmolality and their relative contribution can be calculated as difference between the total sap osmolality and the contribution of the measured major inorganic ions as shown in table 8 the calculated other osmolytes contribution was therefore on average 75 65 and 55 in non salt control s40 and s80 treatments respectively 3 5 heat map analysis a heat map representing the changes in the analyzed parameters in dependence on the shape and different salinity treatments provided an integrated view of the effect of saline water on bougainvillea performance fig 1 gsh accumulated lower na and cl ions in leaves at the highest salinity treatment and in stem and roots independently of salinity showing in these tissues higher k na ratio as well as higher po4 3 concentration than the psh plants moreover gsh plants showed higher incidence of intercellular spaces higher frequency of chloroplasts and a better photochemical efficiency indicated by fv fm qy and etr as well as lower non photochemical processes npq than psh plants however the dry weights of stem and roots were lower in gsh than in psh bougainvillea plants 3 6 principal component analysis multivariate analysis was applied to all studied datasets see tables 1 7 the principal component analysis pca scatter plot clearly separated the six diverse treatments the first two principal components pcs were associated with eigen values higher than one and explained cumulatively 72 8 of the total variance with pc1 and pc2 accounting for 48 1 and 24 7 respectively data not shown saline water contributed to the clear separation on pc1 while shape contributed to separation on pc2 fig 2 pc1 was highly and positively correlated with total n k k na leaf water potential and spad index and was negatively correlated with na cl concentrations as well as with npq additionally pc2 received the main positive contribution from po4 3 concentration photosystem efficiency i e qp fv fm and qy and also from wuei 4 discussion plant responses to saline water are not only dependent on species but also on the duration of salt exposure as well as the concentration and the type of salts these are the main factors to take into account when irrigation with saline brackish water is considered because their interaction will induce plant physiological anatomical and molecular changes álvarez and sánchez blanco 2015 acosta motos et al 2017 in the present study pyramid psh and globe gsh shaped b spectabilis plants supplied with saline water showed similar alterations only at the highest salt concentration s80 while at lower concentration s40 psh plants were more tolerant to saline water the first evident salt constrain was the reduction in dry weight of shoot roots as well as total above ground dry weight produced during the growing cycle taking in account all the cumulative pruning dry weight under salt stress conditions which was milder in psh plants supplied with 40 mm nacl indeed even though the amount of removed shoots by pruning was on average nearly doubled in the gsh plants compared to the psh plants which is due to the different pruning systems adopted to keep the defined and specific shape the plant growth parameters leaf dry weight leaf number and total area of bougainvillea plants trained to pyramid shape were clearly higher than those observed in globe plants however in landscape getting the maximum growth is not crucial for plants like bougainvillea quite the contrary excessive shoot vigor is undesirable and the use of moderate saline water s40 could be useful for obtaining more compact plants cassaniti et al 2009 álvarez and sánchez blanco 2015 indeed a decrease in growth and development and therefore in biomass may also affect the visual and therefore the ornamental quality of the plants gómez bellot et al 2013 an important visual characteristic of b spectabilis is the presence of the thin and papery bracts flowers which confer harmony to the plant the number of these bracts was higher in psh plants under s40 treatments compared to gsh plants while similar behavior was observed when plants were supplied with 80 mm nacl under salt stress conditions the control of ion homeostasis increase of osmolality regulation of crystal accumulation utilization reduction of leaf water potential ψl and stomatal conductance gs is useful for reducing transpiration e thus limiting water loss acosta motos et al 2017 leaf anatomy in b spectabilis under salinity was also harmonized to physiological adjustments in both canopy shapes in such a way to counteract the reduction in transpiration by means of the increase in intercellular spaces and in the incidence of palisade parenchyma over the total mesophyll thickness indeed the increase in the ratio between palisade and spongy parenchyma thickness and in the amount of intercellular spaces have been reported also in other species they are considered adaptive traits of plants to cope with salinity in so far as such modifications improve co2 diffusion in the mesophyll thus compensating for salinity induced increased stomatal limitations acosta motos et al 2015 tattini et al 2006 rouphael et al 2017d the increase in palisade parenchyma thickness occurring in psh plants already at s40 would indicate a better ability to modulate resource allocation under stressful conditions in order to invest more resources towards the assimilatory tissue of these plants if compared to gsh plants fernández garcía et al 2014 the two canopy shapes also seem to induce a different structure mediated regulation of transpiration in b spectabilis but only in non saline conditions the different structure mediated regulation of transpiration rate could be attributed to an alteration of mesophyll traits but the psh plants seem to have also a better control at the stomata level because salinity treated psh plants are able to maintain the same stomata frequency than the control plants although reducing the size of stomata aperture such an adjustment of stomatal traits would allow a faster control of stomata aperture closure that is considered an advantage under stressful conditions raven 2014 similar morphological and physiological effects were already reported in three different shrub species belonging to the genus bougainvillea grown at globe or pyramid under deficit irrigation conditions cirillo et al 2014 in addition another mechanism adopted by gsh plants and even more by psh plants to minimize water loss is also that of restricting leaf area both halophytes and non halophytes plants show particular anatomical changes under high salinity maas and niemann 1978 and most of them are displayed in leaves and are similar to those present under drought stress hameed et al 2010 generally photosynthesis is strongly inhibited by salinity as consequence of both stomatal and non stomatal limitations such as the decrease of maximum quantum efficiency of psii photochemistry fv fm quantum yield of psii electron transport qy and chlorophyll content as well as stomata partial closure steduto et al 2000 mehta et al 2010 accordingly there was a reduction in chlorophyll content and number of chloroplasts accompanied by a decrease in net photosynthetic rate alteration in the localization of chloroplasts and in their structure have also been reported as common responses to salinity or other stresses fernández garcía et al 2014 moreover the thermal dissipation processes namely npq increased as also found in other mainly tolerant species under salt stress conditions acosta motos et al 2015 these strategies allow plant to reduce safely the excess of excitation energy to reaction centers that cannot be utilized in photochemistry thus protecting photosynthetic apparatus from the over excitation of the electron chain and reactive oxygen species ros production demmig adams et al 2014 otherwise other photosynthetic parameters like fv fm and qy remained almost unvaried in particular in psh partially due to the alteration of mesophyll organization that enabled a valuable gas diffusion throughout the spongy parenchyma notwithstanding the reduced stomatal conductance resulting from partial stomatal closure and reduction of stomata frequency moreover the previous results could be explained also by the fact that alexandra like mary palmer a cultivar belonging to the same bouganvillea species might use a photorespiratory glycine shuttle to concentrate co2 from the mesophyll tissue into a bundle sheath like compartment surrounding the vascular tissue sage et al 2014 this mechanism has been described as an intermediate stage between c3 and c4 plants sage et al 2014 indeed the areas in which bougainvillea thrives are often characterized by recurring dryness scarce atmospheric humidity and periodic phenomena of drought and salinity these constrains and in particular salinity can cause high evapotranspiration potentials and water stress maximizing the impact of photorespiration and being important drivers for c3 c4 transition sage et al 2013 another important feature of bougainvillea plants was the ability to retain higher na and cl levels in leaves than in stem and roots under salinity suggesting the existence of an inclusion mechanism operating in the plants which is supposed to be a trait of salt tolerance läuchli and epstein 1990 rodrı guez et al 2005 the salinity related decrease in the number and size of crystals in b spectabilis may also suggest a possible role of such crystals in immobilizing specific elements in case of excess pérez cuadra and cambi 2017 furthermore under nacl salinity the increase of cellular na interferes with k translocation from roots to shoots and with its transport at the plasma membrane therefore strongly lowering k uptake gao et al 2016 na excess contributes both to depolarize and damage the plasma membrane favoring k leaking causing a decrease of cytosolic k wang et al 2013 moreover na tends to replace k in key enzymatic reactions damaging cytosol and organelles for this reasons usually plants are more sensitive to k to na ratio than to the absolute amount of na cuin et al 2009 shabala and cuin 2008 however in bougainvillea k concentration was maintained in all tissues at about 87 and 70 of the corresponding value in leaves and other plant tissues of untreated plants respectively greenway and munns 1980 reported that even if na concentration in plant tissues increased under salinity not necessarily the k to na ratio in the cytoplasm was drastically reduced on the contrary cytosolic k concentration could be maintained at a constant level or even increased by using the k stored in the vacuole the capability to satisfy plant metabolic demand for k under salinity by compartmentalizing na in the vacuole and the majority of k in the cytosol could be another essential mechanism for bougainvillea salt tolerance wang et al 2013 and may also be used by b spectabilis where the volume of the cell occupied by the vacuole seemed to be decreased under salinity if compared with volume occupied by other organelles such as chloroplasts the increase in k concentration in the cytosol might also contribute to osmotically balance the toxic ions compartmentalized in the vacuole in fact also a low k content alone without considering metabolites could be enough to balance the mesophyll cells assuming that under salinity k is for the most located in the cytosol and that the cytosolic compartments including cytosol and hyaloplasmic organelles vacuoles and apoplast occupy about 34 1 45 5 and 20 4 of the cell volume fraction respectively lawlor 1993 cuin et al 2009 5 conclusions greenhouse bougainvillea plant performance and the morpho anatomical physiological and biochemical changes were assessed in a multifactorial approach accounting for the effects of increasing nacl concentration in irrigation water and canopy shape training the results of this study confirmed that bougainvillea is a moderately tolerant ornamental species since increasing nacl concentration up to 40 mm in irrigation water did not reduce the leaf dry weight leaf number and total area but improved the ornamental quality higher number of flowers our findings also demonstrated that bougainvillea plants and in particular the psh shaped ones can enact morpho physiological changes which enable them to maintain a better growth performance higher number of leaves total leaf area and leaf dry weight and ornamental quality higher number of flowers under moderate salinity compared to gsh plants among the different mechanisms toxic ions inclusion in leaves and their compartmentation in vacuoles retention of high levels of k ions in the cytosol for osmotic adjustment and metabolic function leaf area restriction modulation of leaf functional anatomical traits in addition to a c2 kranz mechanism of photosynthesis allow plants to successfully cope even with long term s80 salinity therefore bougainvillea due to its ability to maintain leaf traits good blooming and also a more compact size even under s80 salinity can be considered for revegetation and landscaping

mesophyll and investing more resources in the assimilatory tissue e g increase in intercellular spaces and incidence of palisade parenchyma over the total mesophyll thickness bougainvillea plants enact many sided strategies to acclimate to s80 salinity by harmonizing several mechanisms including sodium and chloride inclusion in leaves and their compartmentalization in vacuoles retention of

relations 1 introduction in mediterranean basin more than 40 of soils are affected by salinity and sodicity nedjimi 2014 in this area daily exposure to hyperosmotic stress due to seawater intrusion into groundwater and irrigation with saline water as well as to seasonal accumulation of salts in the roots due to scarce winter rainfalls increase salinity and reduce crop productivity rana and katerji 2000 maggio et al 2011 salinity decreases plant capacity to extract water from soil and determines accumulation of ions like na and cl at toxic concentrations in cell tissues this dual osmotic and ionic stress reduces cell and tissues expansion and causes nutritional imbalance and oxidative stress affecting plant growth development and survival hasegawa et al 2000 munns and tester 2008 gorham et al 2010 the extent of damage to plants depends not only on salt concentration and toxicity level but also on the specific sensitivity of the plant species that may vary with the phenological stage lutts et al 1995 hasegawa et al 2000 and may be eventually influenced by crop management practices colla et al 2010 rouphael et al 2012 sodium and chloride are both toxic if accumulated at high concentration in cytosol and organelles tavakkoli et al 2010 sodium reduces potassium and calcium uptake affecting stomatal conductance moreover it is able to replace potassium in key enzymatic reactions therefore it is crucial for salt tolerance not only limiting the absolute amount of sodium in the cytosol but also increasing the potassium to sodium ratio present in the cell shabala and cuin 2008 annunziata et al 2017 instead chloride toxic effects concern chlorophyll degradation decline of psii quantum yield and photosynthetic electron transport rate tavakkoli et al 2010 2011

plants irrigated with saline water have been extensively studied under single or combined salt stress annunziata et al 2017 woodrow et al 2017 and references therein however few authors have focused their attention on the effect of salinity on ornamental shrub and bush species completely neglecting them in spite of their wide range of tolerance levels since many of them are naturally occurring in coastal areas and have evolved peculiar combinations of structural and physiological traits to cope with drought salinity and high solar irradiation stresses tattini et al 2002 2006 therefore they provide interesting models to be studied because they would not only provide relevant additional information on general stress tolerance mechanisms in plants but also furnish know how on their adaptability for use in landscaping and urban greening acosta motos et al 2016 2017 cassaniti et al 2009 2012 cirillo et al 2014 kumar et al 2017 in mediterranean arid and semiarid areas as well as in marginal soils brackish water could be used in landscaping projects using ornamental species showing relative degree of salt tolerance acosta motos et al 2015 bougainvillea spectabilis willd also known as great bougainvillea or paper flower for its thin and papery bracts is an important ornamental flowering species of high aesthetic value native of brazil and present nowadays all over the world in areas with tropical or warm climates lack 2012 ghogar and jiraungkoorskul 2017 in a previous study including several landscape species cassaniti et al 2009 classified bougainvillea glabra choisy in dc as moderately salt tolerant based on the reduction of shoot dry weight under long term salinity stress cassaniti et al 2009 also b spectabilis was classified as high tolerant to salt stress for its ability to cope with soil salinity until 10 ds m 1 and accumulated high contents of sodium and chloride in the leaves francois 1980 moreover taking into account the visual appearance is the most important criterion to be considered for ornamental plants acosta motos et al 2016 the ability of b spectabilis to maintain a high visual quality without showing any symptoms of necrosis under sprinkle irrigation with reused water with a salinity level around 2 0 ds m 1 devitt et al 2005 cassaniti et al 2012 could make this salt tolerant ornamental shrub a potential candidate in revegetation projects in arid and degraded land landscaping projects and public areas navarro et al 2007 2008 the degree of adaptation of a species to a major abiotic stress such as drought could also be affected by the canopy shape as demonstrated earlier by cirillo et al 2014 2017 which proved that plants can modify the growth behavior and anatomical hydraulic properties depending on the canopy shape training and irrigation level based on these considerations the aim of this study was to investigate morphological physiological and biochemical changes in b spectabilis alexandra irrigated with saline water and trained at two canopy shapes globe and pyramid in order to unravel possible adaptive strategies combining morpho functional traits at different levels to cope with salinity the salinity tolerance of globe and pyramid trained bougainvillea were compared in terms of growth ornamental quality ions content gas exchange parameters photosystem efficiency water relations and leaf functional anatomical traits the knowledge acquired from this study can be directly translated into specific management measures for revegetation and landscaping programs 2 materials and methods 2 1

as the number of leaves per plant decreased only under severe s80 salt stress conditions table 1 for instance irrespective of canopy shape treatments leaf and stem dry weight as well as the number of leaves were significantly reduced by 37 2 37 4 and 30 1 in s80 compared to non saline control treatment s1 moreover the root dry weight was significantly lowered by 21 3 and 31 1 in s40 and s80 treatments respectively compared to the control treatment with no significant difference between the two saline treatments table 1 averaged over saline water treatments dry weight of both stem and roots resulted lower in the gsh plants table 1 furthermore there was also a decrease of leaf dry weight 37 2 and total leaf area 33 9 in s40 gsh compared to the pyramid shaped psh plants tables 1 and 2 the total above ground dry weight shoot biomass cumulative pruning dry weight produced by the plants during the growing cycle was influenced by salinity and canopy shape but not by their interaction table 1 the increased salinity induced a significant and linear decrease of the total above ground dry weight whereas the gsh plants showed a significantly lower amount 14 9 of produced dry biomass during the entire growing cycle table 1 under moderate salt stress conditions s40 psh bougainvillea plants exhibited more leaves and flowers 35 8 and 82 8 respectively compared to gsh plants whereas no significant effects between the two shapes were observed at s80 table 1 both saline water and canopy shape significantly affected the flower brightness l only s80 treatment yielded darker flower expressed by decreasing l values with no significant difference between globe and pyramide trained plants table 1 except for transpiration rate which was affected by water salinity canopy shape interaction with the highest values recorded in psh plants under control treatment the physiological measurements in particular the net photosynthetic rate pn stomatal conductance gs and intrinsic water use efficiency wuei were only influenced by water salinity when averaged over canopy shape treatments increasing the nacl concentration in the irrigation water reduced pn by 20 2 and 27 8 for s40 and s80 respectively and gs by 33 7 and 45 5 for s40 and s80 respectively in comparison to the control treatment with no significant differences between the two water saline treatments s40 and s80 our results also showed that s80 elicited significant increase 30 8 of wuei compared to non saline treatment whereas s40 exhibited intermediate values table 2 the spad index incurred significant water salinity canopy shape interaction whereas ψl and ψπ were influenced by water salinity and canopy shape with no significant water salinity shape interaction table 2 increasing the nacl concentration in the irrigation water from 1 to 80 mm decreased the greenness readings i e spad index with the lowest values recorded in psh plants supplied with 80 mm nacl table 2 when averaged over canopy shape the ψl decreased as the water salinity level increased by 50 5 and 165 9 in s40 and s80 respectively whereas the ψπ was lowered only under severe salt stress conditions table 2 when averaged over water salinity treatments the ψl and ψp in pyramid trained plants were respectively lower than those in globe trained plants table 2 among the biochemical parameters measured the photochemical quenching qp maximum quantum efficiency of psii photochemistry fv fm as well as linear electron transport rate etr were significantly affected by water salinity canopy shape interaction whereas the quantum yield of psii electron transport qy and non photochemical quenching npq were mainly influenced by canopy shape and to a lesser degree only npq by water salinity table 3 for instance the highest values of fv fm and etr were recorded in psh bougainvillea plants grown under non saline conditions table 3 s80 elicited significant increase 57 2 of npq compared to non saline treatment whereas s40 exhibited intermediate values table 3 finally when averaged over water salinity the highest qy was recorded in gsh plants whereas an opposite trend was observed for npq table 3 3 2 leaf functional anatomical traits in bougainvillea leaves stomatal frequency was significantly influenced by the water salinity canopy shape interaction with the highest value recorded in globe trained plants supplied with non salt control treatment and the lowest value measured in globe shape bougainvillea supplied with 80 mm of nacl table 4 similarly to stomatal frequency stomata size guard cell length gcl and guard cell width gcw were both affected by the water salinity shape interaction with the highest and lowest values recorded in pyramid trained plants with 1 mm and 80 mm nacl respectively table 4 although irrigating with saline water as well as canopy shape did not affect the tissue organization of bougainvillea leaves from a quantitative viewpoint there were significant differences in most analyzed parameters table 5 for instance the thickness of palisade and spongy parenchyma tpp and tsp tissues were influenced by both factors water salinity and shape table 5 in psh plants palisade and spongy parenchyma tissues respectively increased by 24 1 at s40 and by 13 at s80 and decreased according to increasing salinity already in s40 plants by 13 5 in gsh plants the increase of palisade parenchyma was significant only at the highest level of salinity 37 1 while an increase in spongy tissue thickness was evident only in s40 plants 19 4 increasing salinity in irrigation water from 1 mm to 80 mm determined an increase in the percentage of intercellular spaces which was also higher in gsh than psh plants table 5 moreover the volume of the cell occupied by the vacuole in the spongy parenchyma vcs decreased according to increasing water salinity by 11 8 and 18 3 in s40 and s80 respectively and was also higher in psh than gsh bougainvillea table 5 salinity significantly decreased the number of chloroplasts in the palisade parenchyma already in similar extent in both s40 and s80 gsp by 21 in both tissues gsh plants were characterized by higher chloroplasts frequency than psh plants table 5 crystals of calcium oxalate were evidenced by polarized light microscopy in leaf lamina of plants in all treatments for instance the number of crystals per surface unit was significantly influenced by the water salinity shape interaction whereas the crystal size was only affected by the salinity treatment table 5 in fact increasing salinity in irrigation water from 1 to 80 mm reduced both the number and the size of crystals with no significant differences between s40 and s80 finally a sharp reduction in the number of crystals was observed in both bougainvillea canopy shapes at s80 and in gsh plants supplied with s40 whereas the crystals number was not affected by s40 when bougainvillea was trained to a pyramid shape table 5 3 3 ions content and partitioning sodium na and chloride cl contents in leaves stem and roots occurred in increasing pattern with increasing external water salinity the highest concentrations of toxic ions being found in leaves and in particular in those from s80 treated plants table 6 under s40 and s80 na and cl concentrations in leaves increased by 16 8 34 fold and 6 3 17 2 fold respectively compared to non salt control showing the maximum relative increase in ion levels and the maximum concentration in psh plants at s80 the gsh and psh plants accumulated in similar manner na and cl with the only exception in s80 psh plants that accumulated a concentration of cl that was 1 55 fold higher than that of na and almost double compared to the cl in gsh bougainvillea plants these latter were able in general to accumulate less na and cl in roots than psh plants under s80 treatment while they did not differ significantly under moderate stress condition s40 the total n in leaves was negatively affected by salt stress treatment especially with s80 whereas an opposite trend was observed in roots table 7 the gsh treatment averaged over water salinity levels affected the n concentration in leaf tissue which was higher than in psh trained bougainvillea table 7 phosphate po4 3 was significantly higher in all tissues of gsh plants than in psh ones but it did not decrease under salinity table 7 potassium k concentration was higher in stems and roots of gsh than in psh plants it decreased in stems and roots as the external salinity increased getting a 30 maximum decrease at s80 table 7 leaves showed a milder decrease of k by around 7 and 6 in s40 and s80 respectively but when considering the interaction between the main factors water salinity canopy shape k did not decrease in psh and only slightly in gsh plants k na ratio was higher in stem and roots of gsh than in psh plants the decrease of k na ratio in relation to the non stressed control was higher in leaves than in stem and roots according to the lower levels of na retained in these plant tissue and notwithstanding the stronger k decrease furthermore leaf k na ratio decreased to a final value corresponding to 5 4 and 2 7 of the initial value in s40 and s80 treatments respectively table 7 the concentration of calcium ca2 was significantly affected only by salinity and it also decreased in leaves and roots on average 37 and 23 respectively table 7 similarly to the monovalent cation magnesium mg2 concentration was higher in roots of gsh than in psh plants mainly at s80 it decreased by 33 on average in all tissues of plants supplied with 40 and 80 mm nacl table 7 the statistical analysis of the na and cl concentrations among the different parts of bougainvillea plants indicated that both toxic ions reached the highest concentration in leaves 13 0 and 15 5 g kg 1 dw for na and cl respectively compared to stem 5 7 and 3 6 g kg 1 dw for na and cl respectively and roots 6 3 and 3 3 g kg 1 dw for na and cl respectively data not shown 3 4 leaf osmolality bougainvillea sap osmolality was 993 and 801 mosmol kg 1 in leaves of pyramid and globe trained plants respectively however the sap osmolality increased after the addition of nacl in irrigation water reaching a value of 21 and 52 higher than the control in both pyramid and globe under 40 and 80 mm nacl respectively table 8 the relative contribution of the main inorganic ions to osmolality was on average 25 35 and 45 for non salt control s40 and s80 treatments respectively in particular in psh plants the relative ion contribution towards osmolality increased from 1 to 17 for both cl and na while in gsh bougainvillea it increased from 2 to 11 and from 1 to 16 for cl and na respectively on the contrary the k contribution towards osmolality decreased under salinity from 21 to 13 in psh plants and from 25 to 14 in the gsh ones table 8 according to puniran hartley et al 2014 it is might be possible that other ions and metabolites present in the cell might have contribute to osmolality and their relative contribution can be calculated as difference between the total sap osmolality and the contribution of the measured major inorganic ions as shown in table 8 the calculated other osmolytes contribution was therefore on average 75 65 and 55 in non salt control s40 and s80 treatments respectively 3 5 heat map analysis a heat map representing the changes in the analyzed parameters in dependence on the shape and different salinity treatments provided an integrated view of the effect of saline water on bougainvillea performance fig 1 gsh accumulated lower na and cl ions in leaves at the highest salinity treatment and in stem and roots independently of salinity showing in these tissues higher k na ratio as well as higher po4 3 concentration than the psh plants moreover gsh plants showed higher incidence of intercellular spaces higher frequency of chloroplasts and a better photochemical efficiency indicated by fv fm qy and etr as well as lower non photochemical processes npq than psh plants however the dry weights of stem and roots were lower in gsh than in psh bougainvillea plants 3 6 principal component analysis multivariate analysis was applied to all studied datasets see tables 1 7 the principal component analysis pca scatter plot clearly separated the six diverse treatments the first two principal components pcs were associated with eigen values higher than one and explained cumulatively 72 8 of the total variance with pc1 and pc2 accounting for 48 1 and 24 7 respectively data not shown saline water contributed to the clear separation on pc1 while shape contributed to separation on pc2 fig 2 pc1 was highly and positively correlated with total n k k na leaf water potential and spad index and was negatively correlated with na cl concentrations as well as with npq additionally pc2 received the main positive contribution from po4 3 concentration photosystem efficiency i e qp fv fm and qy and also from wuei 4 discussion plant responses to saline water are not only dependent on species but also on the duration of salt exposure as well as the concentration and the type of salts these are the main factors to take into account when irrigation with saline brackish water is considered because their interaction will induce plant physiological anatomical and molecular changes álvarez and sánchez blanco 2015 acosta motos et al 2017 in the present study pyramid psh and globe gsh shaped b spectabilis plants supplied with saline water showed similar alterations only at the highest salt concentration s80 while at lower concentration s40 psh plants were more tolerant to saline water the first evident salt constrain was the reduction in dry weight of shoot roots as well as total above ground dry weight produced during the growing cycle taking in account all the cumulative pruning dry weight under salt stress conditions which was milder in psh plants supplied with 40 mm nacl indeed even though the amount of removed shoots by pruning was on average nearly doubled in the gsh plants compared to the psh plants which is due to the different pruning systems adopted to keep the defined and specific shape the plant growth parameters leaf dry weight leaf number and total area of bougainvillea plants trained to pyramid shape were clearly higher than those observed in globe plants however in landscape getting the maximum growth is not crucial for plants like bougainvillea quite the contrary excessive shoot vigor is undesirable and the use of moderate saline water s40 could be useful for obtaining more compact plants cassaniti et al 2009 álvarez and sánchez blanco 2015 indeed a decrease in growth and development and therefore in biomass may also affect the visual and therefore the ornamental quality of the plants gómez bellot et al 2013 an important visual characteristic of b spectabilis is the presence of the thin and papery bracts flowers which confer harmony to the plant the number of these bracts was higher in psh plants under s40 treatments compared to gsh plants while similar behavior was observed when plants were supplied with 80 mm nacl under salt stress conditions the control of ion homeostasis increase of osmolality regulation of crystal accumulation utilization reduction of leaf water potential ψl and stomatal conductance gs is useful for reducing transpiration e thus limiting water loss acosta motos et al 2017 leaf anatomy in b spectabilis under salinity was also harmonized to physiological adjustments in both canopy shapes in such a way to counteract the reduction in transpiration by means of the increase in intercellular spaces and in the incidence of palisade parenchyma over the total mesophyll thickness indeed the increase in the ratio between palisade and spongy parenchyma thickness and in the amount of intercellular spaces have been reported also in other species they are considered adaptive traits of plants to cope with salinity in so far as such modifications improve co2 diffusion in the mesophyll thus compensating for salinity induced increased stomatal limitations acosta motos et al 2015 tattini et al 2006 rouphael et al 2017d the increase in palisade parenchyma thickness occurring in psh plants already at s40 would indicate a better ability to modulate resource allocation under stressful conditions in order to invest more resources towards the assimilatory tissue of these plants if compared to gsh plants fernández garcía et al 2014 the two canopy shapes also seem to induce a different structure mediated regulation of transpiration in b spectabilis but only in non saline conditions the different structure mediated regulation of transpiration rate could be attributed to an alteration of mesophyll traits but the psh plants seem to have also a better control at the stomata level because salinity treated psh plants are able to maintain the same stomata frequency than the control plants although reducing the size of stomata aperture such an adjustment of stomatal traits would allow a faster control of stomata aperture closure that is considered an advantage under stressful conditions raven 2014 similar morphological and physiological effects were already reported in three different shrub species belonging to the genus bougainvillea grown at globe or pyramid under deficit irrigation conditions cirillo et al 2014 in addition another mechanism adopted by gsh plants and even more by psh plants to minimize water loss is also that of restricting leaf area both halophytes and non halophytes plants show particular anatomical changes under high salinity maas and niemann 1978 and most of them are displayed in leaves and are similar to those present under drought stress hameed et al 2010 generally photosynthesis is strongly inhibited by salinity as consequence of both stomatal and non stomatal limitations such as the decrease of maximum quantum efficiency of psii photochemistry fv fm quantum yield of psii electron transport qy and chlorophyll content as well as stomata partial closure steduto et al 2000 mehta et al 2010 accordingly there was a reduction in chlorophyll content and number of chloroplasts accompanied by a decrease in net photosynthetic rate alteration in the localization of chloroplasts and in their structure have also been reported as common responses to salinity or other stresses fernández garcía et al 2014 moreover the thermal dissipation processes namely npq increased as also found in other mainly tolerant species under salt stress conditions acosta motos et al 2015 these strategies allow plant to reduce safely the excess of excitation energy to reaction centers that cannot be utilized in photochemistry thus protecting photosynthetic apparatus from the over excitation of the electron chain and reactive oxygen species ros production demmig adams et al 2014 otherwise other photosynthetic parameters like fv fm and qy remained almost unvaried in particular in psh partially due to the alteration of mesophyll organization that enabled a valuable gas diffusion throughout the spongy parenchyma notwithstanding the reduced stomatal conductance resulting from partial stomatal closure and reduction of stomata frequency moreover the previous results could be explained also by the fact that alexandra like mary palmer a cultivar belonging to the same bouganvillea species might use a photorespiratory glycine shuttle to concentrate co2 from the mesophyll tissue into a bundle sheath like compartment surrounding the vascular tissue sage et al 2014 this mechanism has been described as an intermediate stage between c3 and c4 plants sage et al 2014 indeed the areas in which bougainvillea thrives are often characterized by recurring dryness scarce atmospheric humidity and periodic phenomena of drought and salinity these constrains and in particular salinity can cause high evapotranspiration potentials and water stress maximizing the impact of photorespiration and being important drivers for c3 c4 transition sage et al 2013 another important feature of bougainvillea plants was the ability to retain higher na and cl levels in leaves than in stem and roots under salinity suggesting the existence of an inclusion mechanism operating in the plants which is supposed to be a trait of salt tolerance läuchli and epstein 1990 rodrı guez et al 2005 the salinity related decrease in the number and size of crystals in b spectabilis may also suggest a possible role of such crystals in immobilizing specific elements in case of excess pérez cuadra and cambi 2017 furthermore under nacl salinity the increase of cellular na interferes with k translocation from roots to shoots and with its transport at the plasma membrane therefore strongly lowering k uptake gao et al 2016 na excess contributes both to depolarize and damage the plasma membrane favoring k leaking causing a decrease of cytosolic k wang et al 2013 moreover na tends to replace k in key enzymatic reactions damaging cytosol and organelles for this reasons usually plants are more sensitive to k to na ratio than to the absolute amount of na cuin et al 2009 shabala and cuin 2008 however in bougainvillea k concentration was maintained in all tissues at about 87 and 70 of the corresponding value in leaves and other plant tissues of untreated plants respectively greenway and munns 1980 reported that even if na concentration in plant tissues increased under salinity not necessarily the k to na ratio in the cytoplasm was drastically reduced on the contrary cytosolic k concentration could be maintained at a constant level or even increased by using the k stored in the vacuole the capability to satisfy plant metabolic demand for k under salinity by compartmentalizing na in the vacuole and the majority of k in the cytosol could be another essential mechanism for bougainvillea salt tolerance wang et al 2013 and may also be used by b spectabilis where the volume of the cell occupied by the vacuole seemed to be decreased under salinity if compared with volume occupied by other organelles such as chloroplasts the increase in k concentration in the cytosol might also contribute to osmotically balance the toxic ions compartmentalized in the vacuole in fact also a low k content alone without considering metabolites could be enough to balance the mesophyll cells assuming that under salinity k is for the most located in the cytosol and that the cytosolic compartments including cytosol and hyaloplasmic organelles vacuoles and apoplast occupy about 34 1 45 5 and 20 4 of the cell volume fraction respectively lawlor 1993 cuin et al 2009 5 conclusions greenhouse bougainvillea plant performance and the morpho anatomical physiological and biochemical changes were assessed in a multifactorial approach accounting for the effects of increasing nacl concentration in irrigation water and canopy shape training the results of this study confirmed that bougainvillea is a moderately tolerant ornamental species since increasing nacl concentration up to 40 mm in irrigation water did not reduce the leaf dry weight leaf number and total area but improved the ornamental quality higher number of flowers our findings also demonstrated that bougainvillea plants and in particular the psh shaped ones can enact morpho physiological changes which enable them to maintain a better growth performance higher number of leaves total leaf area and leaf dry weight and ornamental quality higher number of flowers under moderate salinity compared to gsh plants among the different mechanisms toxic ions inclusion in leaves and their compartmentation in vacuoles retention of high levels of k ions in the cytosol for osmotic adjustment and metabolic function leaf area restriction modulation of leaf functional anatomical traits in addition to a c2 kranz mechanism of photosynthesis allow plants to successfully cope even with long term s80 salinity therefore bougainvillea due to its ability to maintain leaf traits good blooming and also a more compact size even under s80 salinity can be considered for revegetation and landscaping

11244,high input of water and nitrogen n fertilizers in intensive greenhouse vegetable production regions in china has successfully increased crop productivity in the past decades but at a significant environmental cost and resource consumption it is essential to choose best management practice bmp to meet multiple goals such as keeping greenhouse vegetable yield stable improving nitrogen use efficiency nue and reducing the nitrogen pollution issue however the bottleneck is the capacity of predicting the simultaneous effects of different management practice scenarios on multiple goals and choosing bmp among scenarios the object of this study was to identify bmp of water and n fertilizer for greenhouse summer cucumber in north china plain using calibrated and validated eu rotate n model the data used to calibrate and validate the model were collected from a typical greenhouse summer cucumber field with four different water and n fertilizer treatments within the target domain region a total of 240 varied scenarios of water use and fertilizer application were set up and then simulated by the model an osculating value method was used to evaluate combinations of irrigation and fertilizer practices agronomic indices yield wue and nue environmental indices nitrate leaching and gaseous n loss and economic index value to cost ratio were selected as the evaluation indices to identify the bmp the results showed that cucumber yield increased to maximum value as water input reached to about 277 mm then kept constant or even decreased under lower n fertilizer rates nitrogen started to lose as nitrate leaching when irrigation increased to 300 400 mm and then nitrate leaching increased with irrigation increasing the effects of water input on gaseous nitrogen loss were not significant regardless of n fertilizer rates irrigating about 300 mm water can obtain the maximum nue cucumber yield increased to maximum values as n fertilizer input reached to about 313 and 310 kg n ha 1 for furrow and drip irrigation then was not affected by n fertilizer increase the bmps under furrow irrigation condition were to irrigate 300 mm with 300 kg n ha 1 and 250 mm with 300 kg n ha 1 under drip irrigation condition for greenhouse cucumber in the study area respectively adopting the current bmps the applied nitrogen and irrigation water were at about 55 and 40 lower rates respectively than the current conventional use our study indicated that the eu rotate n model combined with osculating value method can be helpful to assess multi goal effects of management alternatives and identify bmp keywords eu rotate n model optimal water and fertilization management practices nitrogen use efficiency osculating value method 1 introduction at present the china s economy has developed rapidly and scientific innovations have been increasing continuously however the shortage of resources and environmental restrictions are the biggest challenges to china s economic growth hence maintaining its rapid economic growth china needs to transform the traditional high consumption and high pollution production pattern to the green development mode as rapidly as possible to produce food in a highly efficient manner with the lowest possible environmental hazards china s modern agriculture is shifting from a single goal to a multi goal strategy a multi goal management of the green agriculture is expected to simultaneously aim for the following four goals a sustaining enhancing productivity crop yields b reducing reactive nitrogenous gases emissions to protect the air quality and the climate c mitigating hydrological nitrogen losses mainly nitrate leaching to secure water quality and d enhancing resource efficiency to reduce the cost and create higher values however single goal management is obviously not environmentally friendly and thus unsustainable because of high water and nitrogen consumption and low use efficiencies therefore best management practice bmp is highly essential which includes the assessment of biogeochemical effects of various management practices i e fertilization and irrigation there are two challenges of identifying a bmp one is how to quantify the biogeochemical effects of various management alternatives on the multiple goals stated above and the other is how to identify the bmp from these management alternatives cui et al 2014 field experiments have played a key role in determining management practice effects for example various water and n fertilizer practices have been employed in field plot experiments to study their effects on nitrogen use efficiency and obtain an optimal water and nitrogen practice smith et al 1998 hu et al 2010 min et al 2012 he et al 2009 pang et al 2009 surface drip or subsurface drip irrigation could not only reduce nitrate leaching by decreasing water drainage but also increase vegetable yield yohannes and tadesse 1998 sharmasarkar et al 2001 in addition optimizing n fertilizer rates application times and methods could further reduce nitrate leaching gaseous nitrogen release and soil residue nitrogen content waddel et al 2000 halvorson et al 2002 muñoz et al 2008 zotarelli et al 2009 some studies also recommended the best nitrogen fertilizer application rates e g ren et al 2010 min et al 2012 however these experimental methods are costly and time consuming and some processes are difficult to measure due to the limited experimental treatments liu et al 2016 alternatively simulation models are a potentially useful approach for the development of management strategies to identify the bmp once calibrated and validated for a given agricultural system they can be used to examine multiple management scenarios they are also very effective tools for demonstrating the effects of improved management practices to growers technical advisors and policy makers recently many mechanistic models have shown good performance in simulating the soil water content nitrogen loss and crop uptake nitrogen sabit and rüstü karaman 2001 gallardo et al 2009 zhang et al 2009 for example the eu rotate n model based on the n able model has been proposed as a powerful tool for simulating water and nitrogen dynamics in soil plant systems and crop growth nendel 2009 rahn et al 2010 the eu rotate n model has been validated and has been used to simulate water nitrogen dynamics and vegetable growth in some studies conducted in various climatic regions guo et al 2010 sun et al 2012 2013 soto et al 2014 sun et al 2013 also used the eu rotate n model to identify the bmp for a greenhouse tomato planting system in china in conjunction with the osculating value method the north china plain is one of the major vegetable cultivation bases in china for example the vegetable cultivation area has increased to 65 000 ha in beijing city beijing municipal bureau of statistics 2016 the severe environmental impact induced by the intensive vegetable production has increased over the last several years shi et al 2009 chen et al 2004 ju et al 2006 because of the notably different characteristics of vegetable production in greenhouse such as more water and nitrogen input higher water and n applied frequency higher humidity lower evaporative demand and negligible wind speed it is necessary to develop a model method that is expected to be applicable for such complicate cases eu rotate n is likely a valuable tool for the evaluation of changes in management on yields environmental impacts resource efficiency with for example a much larger number of scenarios and more complex responses of the goal variable however to date the studies for the use of the eu rotate n model for greenhouse vegetables are still rare especially very few studies on identifying the bmps delimitate the contribution rate of economic cost to identify bmp for the greenhouse vegetables system in the north china plain we conducted a modeling case study at a greenhouse summer cucumber field in beijing suburb where simultaneous observations of cucumber yield soil water content and soil nitrate concentration were available our objectives were to a validate and apply the eu rotate n model using simultaneous observations b use model simulation to analyze the biogeochemical effects of alternative irrigation furrow and drip and fertilization conditions and c identify the best water and fertilizer n management practices aiming at our four goals stated above 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the experiment was conducted

air temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed was collected using an automatic weather station ws std1 2 4 model description and inputs the eu rotate n model was used to simulate soil water movement nitrogen transport and plant growth in this study the model has been embedded in the european decision support system as a tool for assessing the effects of fertilization and rotational practices on crop growth and nitrogen loss nendel 2009 rahn et al 2010 the model contains modules for simulating various soil plant processes including root development n mineralization from soil organic matter and crop residues water and n uptake by roots and water movement and n transport in soil the crop growth module of the model was inherited from the n able model of greenwood et al 1996 the water demand of the crop was calculated with the penman monteith method of the fao allen et al 1998 soil water movement was simulated with the soil water balance method proposed by ritchie 1998 runoff was calculated with the approach recommended by the u s national resource conservation service nrcs 2004 the n mineralization module was based on the routines in the daisy model hansen et al 1990 ammonia volatilization from manure was described with an empirical equation used in the alfam model sфgaard et al 2002 urea hydrolysis and gaseous n emission simulation were based on the amovol model sadeghi et al 1988 basic information was entered in the model including the site location latitude altitude basic soil physical chemical properties soil bulk density soil hydraulic properties soil initial water and mineral nitrogen condition crop data crop species row width plant spacing time of planting number of harvest harvest time field management and meteorological data sun et al 2012 2 5 processes of model calibration and validation and performance criteria we used the measured data from the f c treatment to calibrate the model the trial and error method was used to adjust the model parameters until the values for the statistical procedures rmse nse etc were good boote 1999 wang and huang 2008 ma et al 2012 the calibration process followed the order of soil water content no3 n content and crop yield the measured soil hydraulic properties are shown in table 2 for the cucumber crop the default values of the coefficient table 3 related to the plant growth and nitrogen transport processes in the model nendel 2009 are shown in table 3 however the values of these parameters were adjusted based on the measured cucumber yield and the soil no3 n content during the calibration processes the adjusted cucumber growth and nitrogen transformation parameters are shown in table 3 the calibrated model was then validated with the measured data that were collected from other three treatments d c f opt and d opt four statistical indices were used to assess the agreement between the predicted and observed data during the model calibration and validation 1 root

and a negative value indicates the model overestimation bias 2 6 alternative water and n fertilizer scenarios in this study the scenarios of the water and n fertilizer inputs in the furrow and drip irrigation methods were tested the timing of irrigation and fertilization is the same for the two irrigation methods which is in agreement with experimental practices the investigated paradigms included 1 single factor variation with different water inputs 2 single factor variation with different n fertilizer application rates and 3 two factor variation with different water and n fertilizer inputs the amounts of fertilizer p and k applications met the cucumber growth requirements both were fixed under each scenario the simulation scenarios for each irrigation method were 1 varying the total irrigation amount from 50 to 600 mm in increment of 50 mm 2 varying the total fertilizer n application rate from 60 to 1200 kg n ha 1 in increments of 60 kg n ha 1 the number of scenarios for the water and fertilizer inputs was 12 and 20 respectively and the total number of scenarios combination of water and nitrogen fertilizer applications was 240 for each irrigation method the above described scenarios were conducted by solely varying the mentioned parameters while holding the values of the other parameters at the default levels the cucumber yield water drainage nitrate leaching gaseous n emission wue and nue were simulated or calculated 2 7 assessment of the simulation results with the osculating value method previous studies confirmed that the osculating value method was useful for assessing the effects of the agricultural practices on groundwater quality crop yield and nitrogen loss wang 1989 lou 2002 sun et al 2013 hence the osculating value method was selected to obtain a best water and n fertilizer practice for cucumber production in this study to work with the osculating value method we first built an initial decision matrix consisting of some indicators considering cucumber production maximization of the economic benefit and minimization of environmental pollution the agronomy factor af environment factor ef and value to cost ratio vcr were used as the indicators in the initial decision matrix specifically the cucumber yield wue and nue were selected to calculate the af the weights of the yield wue and nue were set as 0 6 0 2 0 2 respectively hu et al 2010 sun et al 2013 the three indices cucumber yield wue and nue were normalized with a range of 0 1 af was calculated by summing the product of the normalized indices and their corresponding weights gaseous n loss and nitrate leaching were selected to calculate ef the weight of gaseous n loss and nitrate leaching were set as 0 5 and 0 5 ef was calculated in the same way for calculation of the af the vcr was calculated by eq 7 7 vcr w wp of ofp if ifp y yp where w is the irrigation amount mm wp is the water price yuan m 3 of is the amount of organic fertilizer application kg ofp is the organic fertilizer price yuan kg 1 if is the amount of inorganic fertilizer application kg ifp is the inorganic fertilizer price yuan kg 1 y is the cucumber yield kg ha 1 and yp is the cucumber price yuan kg 1 the price of water organic fertilizer inorganic fertilizer and cucumber were 0 35 yuan m 3 0 5 yuan kg 1 5 yuan kg 1and 1 0 yuan kg 1 respectively following the normalization of each element of the initial matrix we obtained a dimensionless decision matrix for a water and fertilizer management study there are n scenarios q1 q2 q n and m assessment indices a1 a2 a m firstly we established an initial decision matrix then normalized each element as a dimensionless decision matrix 8 that can be written as 8 a 1 a 2 a m c q 1 q 2 q n c 11 c 12 c 1 m c 21 c 22 c 2 m c n 1 c n 2 c nm where cij is the value of normalized assessment indices i 1 2 n j 1 2 m secondly a target value can be calculated by 9 r ij c ij i 1 m c ij 2 where the symbol indentifies forward factor indentifies backward factor therefore the dimensionless decision matrix 6 was established 10 r r ij m n thus a theoretical optimal value set qg and the worst value set qb then were shown as lou 2002 11 q g r ij g min r i 1 min r i 2 min r in i 1 2 m 12 q b r ij b max r i 1 max r i 2 max r in i 1 2 m thirdly the distances between the assessment indices and the theoretical optimal value set di g and the worst value set di b were determined by eqs 13 and 14 13 d i g j 1 n ω j r ij r ij g 2 1 2 14 d i b j 1 n ω j r ij r ij b 2 1 2 where ωj is the weight of assessment index j j 1 n ω j 1 in this study the weights of the three indicators af ef and vcr were set as 0 6 0 2 and 0 2 respectively sun et al 2013 finally the optimal osculating value ei g 15 and the worst osculating value ei b 16 were obtained 15 e i g d i g min 1 i m d i g d i b max d i b 1 i m 16 e i b d i b min 1 i m d i b d i g max d i g 1 i m the scenario with the lowest ei g and the highest ei b was the best water and n fertilizer practice for greenhouse cucumber cultivation in this study 2 8 calculation of water use efficiency wue and nitrogen use efficiency nue the wue was calculated with the eq 17 ertek et al 2006 17 wue y et where y is cucumber fruits yield kg ha 1 et is evapotranspiration soil evaporation crop transpiration mm wue is water use efficiency kg m 3 the nue was calculated with the eq 18 hu et al 2010 18 nue y n lose where nlose in apparent n loss it is the sum of uptake n leaching n gaseous n 3 results and discussions 3 1 model calibration and validation the measured dataset soil water content nitrate concentration in the soil profile and crop data etc from the f c treatment was used to calibrate the model we used the trial and error method to adjust the model parameters until the simulated values agreed well with the measured data the simulated and measured soil water content nitrate concentration and cucumber yield for the f c treatment are shown in figs 1 3 firstly the crop coefficients of cucumber in the model were adjusted according to the measured cucumber yield fig 1 compared the simulated and observed yields of greenhouse cucumber in all treatments as the figure illustrates there was a good agreement between simulations and observations of the yields with a slope of 0 918 values of rmse were 0 11 as the observations demonstrated irrigation method and fertilizer input had significant effects on cucumber yield the yields from the d opt treatment were higher by about 13 compared to the f c treatment and water and fertilizer inputs under the d opt treatment were reduced by about 39 and 40 in comparison with the f c treatment cucumber yields did not significantly decrease in response to further application rates of nitrogen fertilizers down the conventional level actually cucumber yield increased by 8 13 when saving 40 fertilizer n and 39 water inputs combining drip irrigation compared to farmer s practice this feature was properly reflected by the model simulation as well which confirmed the ability of the model to simulate the effects of fertilizer and water addition on crop yields additionally nitrogen transformation parameters were adjusted by comparing the simulated and measured values of soil nitrate concentration the comparisons between the measured and simulated values of the soil water content and soil nitrate concentration for the f c treatment were also shown in figs 2 and 3 the statistical indices also indicated that good agreement was observed among them table 4 after the parameter calibration the rmse nse d and pbias values of soil water content and nitrate concentration for all soil depths were acceptable and then the dataset from the other treatments d c f opt and d opt were used to validate the model fig 2 presents the comparison of simulated and measured soil water content under the f c and d opt treatments the simulated and measured nitrate concentrations under d c f opt and d opt treatments are shown in fig 3 the statistical indices for the predicted soil water content and nitrate concentrations for all of model validation treatments are shown in table 5 for the whole soil profile the rmse value of the soil water content was 0 021 indicating a good agreement between the simulated and measured soil water content fang et al 2008 the rmse value for soil nitrate concentration was relatively larger but was acceptable nangia et al 2008 guo et al 2010 willmott 1981 proposed that a lower rmses value compared with the rmseu value indicated acceptable model performance in this study the rmses values of the soil water content and nitrate concentration were lower than their rmseu table 5 moreover the nse values of the soil water content and nitrate concentration were 0 460 and 0 338 respectively because of the complexity of n turnover in soil low nse values of the soil nitrate concentrations were usually found in the model calibrations wang and huang 2008 fang et al 2008 guo et al 2010 additionally it has been reported that lower nse values were acceptable for estimating the relative effects of different management methods on nitrate loss with a model thorp et al 2007 the pbias values of the soil water content and soil nitrate concentration were 0 181 and 4 575 respectively the d values were all higher than 0 80 table 5 ma et al 2012 suggested that the simulated results were satisfactory when nse 0 7 d 0 7 and 15 pbias 15 for a point model such as rzwmq2 furthermore the correlation coefficients for the soil water content and nitrate concentration were also analyzed which were 0 809 and 0 494 respectively with significant at p 0 001 fig 4 it indicated that the calibrated model performed reasonably well in predicting simulated and measured soil water content and nitrate concentration from the simulated results it can be concluded that the eu rotate n model performed reasonably well in predicting the responses of cucumber yield and tracking the fates of nitrogen under different water and fertilization field practices and thus the model could be used to identify bmp of vegetable production in this study area 3 2 responses of the cucumber growth nitrate leaching and gaseous nitrogen release to irrigation options the simulated responses of the cucumber yield to irrigation under furrow and drip irrigation with different n fertilizer rates are shown in fig 5 greenhouse crops are different from open field crops and irrigation is their only supply of water under furrow or drip irrigation below the critical water input 277 mm the cucumber yield increased with the increasing water input and reached a maximum regardless of the n fertilizer application however the cucumber yield was unchanged or slightly decreased with an increasing amount of irrigation water to more than the critical level we can use a linear model with a plateau to describe the relationships between the cucumber yield and irrigation amount r 0 91 for furrow irrigation and r 0 92 for drip irrigation n 240 the amount of nitrate leaching is positively related to the amount of water drainage wang et al 2010 sun et al 2012 we also presented the water drainage against the irrigation amount in fig 6 we found that similar relationships between water drainage and irrigation water amount occurred with the furrow or drip irrigation methods it should be observed that more water drainage would occur with furrow irrigation especially with relative high irrigation options in practice the same amount of irrigation requires a shorter time to saturate the soil for furrow irrigation compared with drip irrigation thus soil is easily saturated in the former method however there is no irrigation time setup for different methods in the module for simulating water movement in the model therefore water drainage may be overestimated for scenarios with higher water input we observed that little water drainage occurred when 250 mm of irrigation water was applied and then the amount of drainage sharply increased along with increasing irrigation water nitrate leaching changes with water input are shown in fig 6 for various n fertilizer options nitrogen started to decrease with nitrate leaching when the irrigation was increased to 300 400 mm and then nitrate leaching continuously increased with increasing irrigation nitrate leaching resulted in a nitrogen shortage for cucumber growth under lower n fertilizer input which reduced the cucumber yield fig 5 our results also indicated that serious nitrate leaching occurred when one third of the irrigated water was drained the effects of the water input on the gaseous nitrogen loss were not significant for all of the n fertilizer options an increase in gaseous nitrogen loss was found when the amount of n fertilizer increased from 50 kg n ha 1 to 100 kg n ha 1 the relationships between nue and amount of irrigation could be described as approximate parabolic curves fig 6 for a fixed amount of fertilizer application the nue showed a rapidly increasing trend with increasing irrigation amounts and approached a maximum value when the irrigation amount was approximately 300 mm if the irrigation rate was higher than that value the nue showed a decreasing trend with an increasing amount of irrigation 3 3 responses of cucumber growth nitrate leaching and gaseous nitrogen release to the n fertilizer options the simulated responses of the cucumber yield to the amount of n fertilizer under furrow and drip irrigation at different irrigation rates are shown in fig 7 the relationships between the cucumber yield and fertilizer inputs are similar to the relationship between the cucumber yield and irrigation inputs however the cucumber yield was not found to decrease with increasing n fertilizer for any irrigation application we also used a linear model with a plateau to describe the relationships between the cucumber yield and fertilizer amount r 0 90 for furrow irrigation and r 0 89 for drip irrigation n 240 under furrow or drip irrigation below the critical n fertilizer input 313 8 and 310 6 kg n ha 1 the cucumber yield increased with increasing nitrogen input and reached a maximum however the cucumber yield did not change with increasing n fertilizer above the critical level the hydraulic properties of soil and water status determine directly the water movement in soil profile therefore the interaction of water and fertilizer on water drainage is not considered in the eu rotate n model rahn et al 2010 although the ability of uptake water of crop is influenced by the condition of growth closely related to n input no directly relationships between water drainage and n application ratio still were observed sun et al 2012 2013 we thought eu rotate n model had less errors in estimating water drainage in this study as a result the water drainage is mainly determined by the irrigation amount which was confirmed by that the relationship between water drainage and the n fertilizer inputs paralleled the x axis n fertilizer inputs fig 8 changes in nitrate leaching with n fertilizer inputs are shown in fig 8 the amount of nitrate leaching increased linearly with the increasing n fertilizer application rates under furrow or drip irrigation moreover their relationships were controlled by the water input for lower water input options the amount of nitrate leaching changed slowly with increasing n fertilizer input because of less water drainage and more n residue in the soil fig 8 we also found that the rate of nitrate leaching increasing with the n fertilizer application rate under drip irrigation was smaller compared with that under furrow irrigation which with relatively lower nitrate leaching under drip irrigation because there was no significant relationship between the water input and gaseous nitrogen release the lines describing the changes of gaseous nitrogen loss with n fertilizer input overlapped together gaseous nitrogen loss increased linearly with n fertilizer input and a relatively lower amount was observed under drip irrigation the relationships between nue and the n fertilizer rates could be approximately described as a power function fig 8 decreasing with increasing n fertilizer input for a given amount of irrigation the nues showed a decreasing trend with increasing fertilizer inputs at the lower fertilizer application level the nues were much higher than those of the others but the cucumber yields were very low fig 6 the amounts of nitrate leaching and gaseous nitrogen loss were the lowest under the lower fertilizer application which yielded the highest nue 3 4 optimal water and nitrogen fertilizer management it was clearly shown that the more water and n fertilizer inputs that were applied the more water drainage and nitrogen loss were observed figs 6 and 8 therefore the scenarios with the lowest irrigation and n amounts 50 mm water and 60 kg n ha 1 had the lowest oov the optimal osculating value and the highest wov the worst osculating value but low cucumber yields the basic requirement for the options was that the cucumber yield was more than the average yield of this cucumber variety in this study area 100 ton ha 1 table 6 under both irrigation methods the treatments with more than 550 mm of irrigation and more than 1100 kg n ha 1 of fertilizer yielded approximately 110 ton ha 1 of cucumber the amounts of nitrate leaching and gaseous nitrogen release were very high resulting in a higher oov and a lower wov additionally the vcr was very low with regard to these options when drip irrigation was applied the amounts of irrigation and fertilizer application were reduced to 250 mm and 300 kg n ha 1 respectively and the cucumber yield was maintained at 100 600 ton ha 1 but was reduced by 8 5 compared to the maximum yield table 6 however the nue significantly increased from 152 51 to 272 12 kg kg 1 n 1 nitrate leaching and gaseous nitrogen release were reduced by 99 and 73 to only 0 55 and 43 79 kg n ha 1 while the vcr was 27 94 furthermore the values of oov and wov were the lowest and greatest respectively for furrow irrigation the treatment with 300 mm of irrigation and 300 kg n ha 1 of fertilizer had the lowest oov and the highest wov table 6 in this situation the cucumber yield reached 102 45 ton ha 1 which was only reduced by 5 7 in comparison to the maximum yield nitrate leaching and gaseous nitrogen release were only 2 96 and 42 23 kg n ha 1 while the nue was 274 41 kg kg 1 n 1 and the vcr was up to 27 14 table 6 therefore application of 250 mm of water and 300 kg n ha 1 was optimal for greenhouse cucumber yields under drip irrigation practice comparatively more water input was required and 300 mm of water with 300 kg n ha 1 was better under furrow irrigation for greenhouse cucumber production in the beijing region gao et al 2010 proposed that the highest wue and nue and good yield and quality were obtained under the application of 300 mm of water and 240 kg n ha 1 in a similar cultivation season based on a field experiment moreover an n recommendation system based on the n target value was employed for greenhouse vegetable production in china which was useful for reducing nitrogen loss and improving nue chen et al 2005 he et al 2007 2009 guo et al 2008 ren et al 2010 guo et al 2008 reported that approximately 300 kg n ha 1 under furrow irrigation was recommended by the system for cucumber growth from march to july in beijing from our simulation results the recommended optional practices were 300 kg n ha 1 with 250 or 300 mm of water under drip or furrow irrigation respectively 4 conclusions after calibration and validation using the data collected from a greenhouse field in the beijing region the eu rotate n model can be used as a helpful tool for multi goal estimation such as the responses of the cucumber yield nitrate leaching gaseous nitrogen release and nue to various water and n fertilizer rates under furrow or drip irrigation conditions the simulated results indicated that the cucumber yield increased to the maximum value as water or n fertilizer application reached a critical level but no further increase in yield with higher rates of water or n fertilizer inputs and meanwhile the environmental risk and economic cost increased linearly with increasing water input and n fertilizer rates based on results from the assessment with the osculating value method the bmp for greenhouse cucumber production in the beijing could be consist of 300 mm of irrigation water with 300 kg n ha 1 of fertilizer for the furrow irrigation method under this management the yield wue and nue were 102 4 ton ha 1 40 47 kg m 3 and 274 41 kg kg 1 respectively and for the drip irrigation method it could be 250 mm of irrigation water with 300 kg n ha 1 of fertilizer under the condition the yield wue and nue were 100 6 ton ha 1 47 98 kg m 3 and 272 12 kg kg 1 respectively while we were encouraged by the eu rotate n model for the multi goal estimation we realized that there were still limitations for widespread application of this tool firstly the model were only calibrated and validated for water and nitrate dynamics in soil profile but not for thoroughly tested against n leaching and gases emission although the simulations of these variables were critical however the datasets used in this study were the best ones currently available secondly soil heterogeneity and climate varieties would be the major obstacle for applying the model across sites thirdly the calibrated model however still slightly underestimated or overestimated soil nitrate content under the different treatments due to some model assumptions fourthly the output uncertainties associated with the quality of the available input parameters needed to be lessened this requires more efforts in the future anyhow this study will make the revised model an increasingly useful tool for evaluating multi goal management and providing bmp options for vegetable production in china we hope this paper will fuel more interest in this research area acknowledgements this

11244,high input of water and nitrogen n fertilizers in intensive greenhouse vegetable production regions in china has successfully increased crop productivity in the past decades but at a significant environmental cost and resource consumption it is essential to choose best management practice bmp to meet multiple goals such as keeping greenhouse vegetable yield stable improving nitrogen use efficiency nue and reducing the nitrogen pollution issue however the bottleneck is the capacity of predicting the simultaneous effects of different management practice scenarios on multiple goals and choosing bmp among scenarios the object of this study was to identify bmp of water and n fertilizer for greenhouse summer cucumber in north china plain using calibrated and validated eu rotate n model the data used to calibrate and validate the model were collected from a typical greenhouse summer cucumber field with four different water and n fertilizer treatments within the target domain region a total of 240 varied scenarios of water use and fertilizer application were set up and then simulated by the model an osculating value method was used to evaluate combinations of irrigation and fertilizer practices agronomic indices yield wue and nue environmental indices nitrate leaching and gaseous n loss and economic index value to cost ratio were selected as the evaluation indices to identify the bmp the results showed that cucumber yield increased to maximum value as water input reached to about 277 mm then kept constant or even decreased under lower n fertilizer rates nitrogen started to lose as nitrate leaching when irrigation increased to 300 400 mm and then nitrate leaching increased with irrigation increasing the effects of water input on gaseous nitrogen loss were not significant regardless of n fertilizer rates irrigating about 300 mm water can obtain the maximum nue cucumber yield increased to maximum values as n fertilizer input reached to about 313 and 310 kg n ha 1 for furrow and drip irrigation then was not affected by n fertilizer increase the bmps under furrow irrigation condition were to irrigate 300 mm with 300 kg n ha 1 and 250 mm with 300 kg n ha 1 under drip irrigation condition for greenhouse cucumber in the study area respectively adopting the current bmps the applied nitrogen and irrigation water were at about 55 and 40 lower rates respectively than the current conventional use our study indicated that the eu rotate n model combined with osculating value method can be helpful to assess multi goal effects of management alternatives and identify bmp keywords eu rotate n model optimal water and fertilization management practices nitrogen use efficiency osculating value method 1 introduction at present the china s economy has developed rapidly and scientific innovations have been increasing continuously however the shortage of resources and environmental restrictions are the biggest challenges to china s economic growth hence maintaining its rapid economic growth china needs to transform the traditional high consumption and high pollution production pattern to the green development mode as rapidly as possible to produce food in a highly efficient manner with the lowest possible environmental hazards china s modern agriculture is shifting from a single goal to a multi goal strategy a multi goal management of the green agriculture is expected to simultaneously aim for the following four goals a sustaining enhancing productivity crop yields b reducing reactive nitrogenous gases emissions to protect the air quality and the climate c mitigating hydrological nitrogen losses mainly nitrate leaching to secure water quality and d enhancing resource efficiency to reduce the cost and create higher values however single goal management is obviously not environmentally friendly and thus unsustainable because of high water and nitrogen consumption and low use efficiencies therefore best management practice bmp is highly essential which includes the assessment of biogeochemical effects of various management practices i e fertilization and irrigation there are two challenges of identifying a bmp one is how to quantify the biogeochemical effects of various management alternatives on the multiple goals stated above and the other is how to identify the bmp from these management alternatives cui et al 2014 field experiments have played a key role in determining management practice effects for example various water and n fertilizer practices have been employed in field plot experiments to study their effects on nitrogen use efficiency and obtain an optimal water and nitrogen practice smith et al 1998 hu et al 2010 min et al 2012 he et al 2009 pang et al 2009 surface drip or subsurface drip irrigation could not only reduce nitrate leaching by decreasing water drainage but also increase vegetable yield yohannes and tadesse 1998 sharmasarkar et al 2001 in addition optimizing n fertilizer rates application times and methods could further reduce nitrate leaching gaseous nitrogen release and soil residue nitrogen content waddel et al 2000 halvorson et al 2002 muñoz et al 2008 zotarelli et al 2009 some studies also recommended the best nitrogen fertilizer application rates e g ren et al 2010 min et al 2012 however these experimental methods are costly and time consuming and some processes are difficult to measure due to the limited experimental treatments liu et al 2016 alternatively simulation models are a potentially useful approach for the development of management strategies to identify the bmp once calibrated and validated for a given agricultural system they can be used to examine multiple management scenarios they are also very effective tools for demonstrating the effects of improved management practices to growers technical advisors and policy makers recently many mechanistic models have shown good performance in simulating the soil water content nitrogen loss and crop uptake nitrogen sabit and rüstü karaman 2001 gallardo et al 2009 zhang et al 2009 for example the eu rotate n model based on the n able model has been proposed as a powerful tool for simulating water and nitrogen dynamics in soil plant systems and crop growth nendel 2009 rahn et al 2010 the eu rotate n model has been validated and has been used to simulate water nitrogen dynamics and vegetable growth in some studies conducted in various climatic regions guo et al 2010 sun et al 2012 2013 soto et al 2014 sun et al 2013 also used the eu rotate n model to identify the bmp for a greenhouse tomato planting system in china in conjunction with the osculating value method the north china plain is one of the major vegetable cultivation bases in china for example the vegetable cultivation area has increased to 65 000 ha in beijing city beijing municipal bureau of statistics 2016 the severe environmental impact induced by the intensive vegetable production has increased over the last several years shi et al 2009 chen et al 2004 ju et al 2006 because of the notably different characteristics of vegetable production in greenhouse such as more water and nitrogen input higher water and n applied frequency higher humidity lower evaporative demand and negligible wind speed it is necessary to develop a model method that is expected to be applicable for such complicate cases eu rotate n is likely a valuable tool for the evaluation of changes in management on yields environmental impacts resource efficiency with for example a much larger number of scenarios and more complex responses of the goal variable however to date the studies for the use of the eu rotate n model for greenhouse vegetables are still rare especially very few studies on identifying the bmps delimitate the contribution rate of economic cost to identify bmp for the greenhouse vegetables system in the north china plain we conducted a modeling case study at a greenhouse summer cucumber field in beijing suburb where simultaneous observations of cucumber yield soil water content and soil nitrate concentration were available our objectives were to a validate and apply the eu rotate n model using simultaneous observations b use model simulation to analyze the biogeochemical effects of alternative irrigation furrow and drip and fertilization conditions and c identify the best water and fertilizer n management practices aiming at our four goals stated above 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the experiment was conducted at the luxi vegetable research institute demonstration site fangshan district 39 38 116 01 e which is located in the southwest of beijing municipality in the northern china the annual average air

air temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed was collected using an automatic weather station ws std1 2 4 model description and inputs the eu rotate n model was used to simulate soil water movement nitrogen transport and plant growth in this study the model has been embedded in the european decision support system as a tool for assessing the effects of fertilization and rotational practices on crop growth and nitrogen loss nendel 2009 rahn et al 2010 the model contains modules for simulating various soil plant processes including root development n mineralization from soil organic matter and crop residues water and n uptake by roots and water movement and n transport in soil the crop growth module of the model was inherited from the n able model of greenwood et al 1996 the water demand of the crop was calculated with the penman monteith method of the fao allen et al 1998 soil water movement was simulated with the soil water balance method proposed by ritchie 1998 runoff was calculated with the approach recommended by the u s national resource conservation service nrcs 2004 the n mineralization module was based on the routines in the daisy model hansen et al 1990 ammonia volatilization from manure was described with an empirical equation used in the alfam model sфgaard et al 2002 urea hydrolysis and gaseous n emission simulation were based on the amovol model sadeghi et al 1988 basic information was entered in the model including the site location latitude altitude basic soil physical chemical properties soil bulk density soil hydraulic properties soil initial water and mineral nitrogen condition crop data crop species row width plant spacing time of planting number of harvest harvest time field management and meteorological data sun et al 2012 2 5 processes of model calibration and validation and performance criteria we used the measured data from the f c treatment to calibrate the model the trial and error method was used to adjust the model parameters until the values for the statistical procedures rmse nse etc were good boote 1999 wang and huang 2008 ma et al 2012 the calibration process followed the order of soil water content no3 n content and crop yield the measured soil hydraulic properties are shown in table 2 for the cucumber crop the default values of the coefficient table 3 related to the plant growth and nitrogen transport processes in the model nendel 2009 are shown in table 3 however the values of these parameters were adjusted based on the measured cucumber yield and the soil no3 n content during the calibration processes the adjusted cucumber growth and nitrogen transformation parameters are shown in table 3 the calibrated model was then validated with the measured data that were collected from other three treatments d c f opt and d opt four statistical indices were used to assess the agreement between the predicted and observed data during the model calibration and validation 1 root

and a negative value indicates the model overestimation bias 2 6 alternative water and n fertilizer scenarios in this study the scenarios of the water and n fertilizer inputs in the furrow and drip irrigation methods were tested the timing of irrigation and fertilization is the same for the two irrigation methods which is in agreement with experimental practices the investigated paradigms included 1 single factor variation with different water inputs 2 single factor variation with different n fertilizer application rates and 3 two factor variation with different water and n fertilizer inputs the amounts of fertilizer p and k applications met the cucumber growth requirements both were fixed under each scenario the simulation scenarios for each irrigation method were 1 varying the total irrigation amount from 50 to 600 mm in increment of 50 mm 2 varying the total fertilizer n application rate from 60 to 1200 kg n ha 1 in increments of 60 kg n ha 1 the number of scenarios for the water and fertilizer inputs was 12 and 20 respectively and the total number of scenarios combination of water and nitrogen fertilizer applications was 240 for each irrigation method the above described scenarios were conducted by solely varying the mentioned parameters while holding the values of the other parameters at the default levels the cucumber yield water drainage nitrate leaching gaseous n emission wue and nue were simulated or calculated 2 7 assessment of the simulation results with the osculating value method previous studies confirmed that the osculating value method was useful for assessing the effects of the agricultural practices on groundwater quality crop yield and nitrogen loss wang 1989 lou 2002 sun et al 2013 hence the osculating value method was selected to obtain a best water and n fertilizer practice for cucumber production in this study to work with the osculating value method we first built an initial decision matrix consisting of some indicators considering cucumber production maximization of the economic benefit and minimization of environmental pollution the agronomy factor af environment factor ef and value to cost ratio vcr were used as the indicators in the initial decision matrix specifically the cucumber yield wue and nue were selected to calculate the af the weights of the yield wue and nue were set as 0 6 0 2 0 2 respectively hu et al 2010 sun et al 2013 the three indices cucumber yield wue and nue were normalized with a range of 0 1 af was calculated by summing the product of the normalized indices and their corresponding weights gaseous n loss and nitrate leaching were selected to calculate ef the weight of gaseous n loss and nitrate leaching were set as 0 5 and 0 5 ef was calculated in the same way for calculation of the af the vcr was calculated by eq 7 7 vcr w wp of ofp if ifp y yp where w is the irrigation amount mm wp is the water price yuan m 3 of is the amount of organic fertilizer application kg ofp is the organic fertilizer price yuan kg 1 if is the amount of inorganic fertilizer application kg ifp is the inorganic fertilizer price yuan kg 1 y is the cucumber yield kg ha 1 and yp is the cucumber price yuan kg 1 the price of water organic fertilizer inorganic fertilizer and cucumber were 0 35 yuan m 3 0 5 yuan kg 1 5 yuan kg 1and 1 0 yuan kg 1 respectively following the normalization of each element of the initial matrix we obtained a dimensionless decision matrix for a water and fertilizer management study there are n scenarios q1 q2 q n and m assessment indices a1 a2 a m firstly we established an initial decision matrix then normalized each element as a dimensionless decision matrix 8 that can be written as 8 a 1 a 2 a m c q 1 q 2 q n c 11 c 12 c 1 m c 21 c 22 c 2 m c n 1 c n 2 c nm where cij is the value of normalized assessment indices i 1 2 n j 1 2 m secondly a target value can be calculated by 9 r ij c ij i 1 m c ij 2 where the symbol indentifies forward factor indentifies backward factor therefore the dimensionless decision matrix 6 was established 10 r r ij m n thus a theoretical optimal value set qg and the worst value set qb then were shown as lou 2002 11 q g r ij g min r i 1 min r i 2 min r in i 1 2 m 12 q b r ij b max r i 1 max r i 2 max r in i 1 2 m thirdly the distances between the assessment indices and the theoretical optimal value set di g and the worst value set

the three indicators af ef and vcr were set as 0 6 0 2 and 0 2 respectively sun et al 2013 finally the optimal osculating value ei g 15 and the worst osculating value ei b 16 were obtained 15 e i g d i g min 1 i m d i g d i b max d i b 1 i m 16 e i b d i b min 1 i m d i b d i g max d i g 1 i m the scenario with the lowest ei g and the highest ei b was the best water and n fertilizer practice for greenhouse cucumber cultivation in this study 2 8 calculation of water use efficiency wue and nitrogen use efficiency nue the wue was calculated with the eq 17 ertek et al 2006 17 wue y et where y is cucumber fruits yield kg ha 1 et is evapotranspiration soil evaporation crop transpiration mm wue is water use efficiency kg m 3 the nue was calculated with the eq 18 hu et al 2010 18 nue y n lose where nlose in apparent n loss it is the sum of uptake n leaching n gaseous n 3 results and discussions 3 1 model calibration and validation the measured dataset soil water content nitrate concentration in the soil profile and crop data etc from the f c treatment was used to calibrate the model we used the trial and error method to adjust the model parameters until the simulated values agreed well with the measured data the simulated and measured soil water content nitrate concentration and cucumber yield for the f c treatment are shown in figs 1 3 firstly the crop coefficients of cucumber in the model were adjusted according to the measured cucumber yield fig 1 compared the simulated and observed yields of greenhouse cucumber in all treatments as the figure illustrates there was a good agreement between simulations and observations of the yields with a slope of 0 918 values of rmse were 0 11 as the observations demonstrated irrigation method and fertilizer input had significant effects on cucumber yield the yields from the d opt treatment were higher by about 13 compared to the f c treatment and water and fertilizer inputs under the d opt treatment were reduced by about 39 and 40 in comparison with the f c treatment cucumber yields did not significantly decrease in response to further application rates of nitrogen fertilizers down the conventional level actually cucumber yield increased by 8 13 when saving 40 fertilizer n and 39 water inputs combining drip irrigation compared to farmer s practice this feature was properly reflected by the model simulation as well which confirmed the ability of the model to simulate the effects of fertilizer and water addition on crop yields additionally nitrogen transformation parameters were adjusted by comparing the simulated and measured values of soil nitrate concentration the comparisons between the measured and simulated values of the soil water content and soil nitrate concentration for the f c treatment were also shown in figs 2 and 3 the statistical indices also indicated that good agreement was observed among them table 4 after the parameter calibration the rmse nse d and pbias values of soil water content and nitrate concentration for all soil depths were acceptable and then the dataset from the other treatments d c f opt and d opt were used to validate the model fig 2 presents the comparison of simulated and measured soil water content under the f c and d opt treatments the simulated and measured nitrate concentrations under d c f opt and d opt treatments are shown in fig 3 the statistical indices for the predicted soil water content and nitrate concentrations for all of model validation treatments are shown in table 5 for the whole soil profile the rmse value of the soil water content was 0 021 indicating a good agreement between the simulated and measured soil water content fang et al 2008 the rmse value for soil nitrate concentration was relatively larger but was acceptable nangia et al 2008 guo et al 2010 willmott 1981 proposed that a lower rmses value compared with the rmseu value indicated acceptable model performance in this study the rmses values of the soil water content and nitrate concentration were lower than their rmseu table 5 moreover the nse values of the soil water content and nitrate concentration were 0 460 and 0 338 respectively because of the complexity of n turnover in soil low nse values of the soil nitrate concentrations were usually found in the model calibrations wang and huang 2008 fang et al 2008 guo et al 2010 additionally it has been reported that lower nse values were acceptable for estimating the relative effects of different management methods on nitrate loss with a model thorp et al 2007 the pbias values of the soil water content and soil nitrate concentration were 0 181 and 4 575 respectively the d values were all higher than 0 80 table 5 ma et al 2012 suggested that the simulated results were satisfactory when nse 0 7 d 0 7 and 15 pbias 15 for a point model such as rzwmq2 furthermore the correlation coefficients for the soil water content and nitrate concentration were also analyzed which were 0 809 and 0 494 respectively with significant at p 0 001 fig 4 it indicated that the calibrated model performed reasonably well in predicting simulated and measured soil water content and nitrate concentration from the simulated results it can be concluded that the eu rotate n model performed reasonably well in predicting the responses of cucumber yield and tracking the fates of nitrogen under different water and fertilization field practices and thus the model could be used to identify bmp of vegetable production in this study area 3 2 responses of the cucumber growth nitrate leaching and gaseous nitrogen release to irrigation options the simulated responses of the cucumber yield to irrigation under furrow and drip irrigation with different n fertilizer rates are shown in fig 5 greenhouse crops are different from open field crops and irrigation is their only supply of water under furrow or drip irrigation below the critical water input 277 mm the cucumber yield increased with the increasing water input and reached a maximum regardless of the n fertilizer application however the cucumber yield was unchanged or slightly decreased with an increasing amount of irrigation water to more than the critical level we can use a linear model with a plateau to describe the relationships between the cucumber yield and irrigation amount r 0 91 for furrow irrigation and r 0 92 for drip irrigation n 240 the amount of nitrate leaching is positively related to the amount of water drainage wang et al 2010 sun et al 2012 we also presented the water drainage against the irrigation amount in fig 6 we found that similar relationships between water drainage and irrigation water amount occurred with the furrow or drip irrigation methods it should be observed that more water drainage would occur with furrow irrigation especially with relative high irrigation options in practice the same amount of irrigation requires a shorter time to saturate the soil for furrow irrigation compared with drip irrigation thus soil is easily saturated in the former method however there is no irrigation time setup for different methods in the module for simulating water movement in the model therefore water drainage may be overestimated for scenarios with higher water input we observed that little water drainage occurred when 250 mm of irrigation water was applied and then the amount of drainage sharply increased along with increasing irrigation water nitrate leaching changes with water input are shown in fig 6 for various n fertilizer options nitrogen started to decrease with nitrate leaching when the irrigation was increased to 300 400 mm and then nitrate leaching continuously increased with increasing irrigation nitrate leaching resulted in a nitrogen shortage for cucumber growth under lower n fertilizer input which reduced the cucumber yield fig 5 our results also indicated that serious nitrate leaching occurred when one third of the irrigated water was drained the effects of the water input on the gaseous nitrogen loss were not significant for all of the n fertilizer options an increase in gaseous nitrogen loss was found when the amount of n fertilizer increased from 50 kg n ha 1 to 100 kg n ha 1 the relationships between nue and amount of irrigation could be described as approximate parabolic curves fig 6 for a fixed amount of fertilizer application the nue showed a rapidly increasing trend with increasing irrigation amounts and approached a maximum value when the irrigation amount was approximately 300 mm if the irrigation rate was higher than that value the nue showed a decreasing trend with an increasing amount of irrigation 3 3 responses of cucumber growth nitrate leaching and gaseous nitrogen release to the n fertilizer options the simulated responses of the cucumber yield to the amount of n fertilizer under furrow and drip irrigation at different irrigation rates are shown in fig 7 the relationships between the cucumber yield and fertilizer inputs are similar to the relationship between the cucumber yield and irrigation inputs however the cucumber yield was not found to decrease with increasing n fertilizer for any irrigation application we also used a linear model with a plateau to describe the relationships between the cucumber yield and fertilizer amount r 0 90 for furrow irrigation and r 0 89 for drip irrigation n 240 under furrow or drip irrigation below the critical n fertilizer input 313 8 and 310 6 kg n ha 1 the cucumber yield increased with increasing nitrogen input and reached a maximum however the cucumber yield did not change with increasing n fertilizer above the critical level the hydraulic properties of soil and water status determine directly the water movement in soil profile therefore the interaction of water and fertilizer on water drainage is not considered in the eu rotate n model rahn et al 2010 although the ability of uptake water of crop is influenced by the condition of growth closely related to n input no directly relationships between water drainage and n application ratio still were observed sun et al 2012 2013 we thought eu rotate n model had less errors in estimating water drainage in this study as a result the water drainage is mainly determined by the irrigation amount which was confirmed by that the relationship between water drainage and the n fertilizer inputs paralleled the x axis n fertilizer inputs fig 8 changes in nitrate leaching with n fertilizer inputs are shown in fig 8 the amount of nitrate leaching increased linearly with the increasing n fertilizer application rates under furrow or drip irrigation moreover their relationships were controlled by the water input for lower water input options the amount of nitrate leaching changed slowly with increasing n fertilizer input because of less water drainage and more n residue in the soil fig 8 we also found that the rate of nitrate leaching increasing with the n fertilizer application rate under drip irrigation was smaller compared with that under furrow irrigation which with relatively lower nitrate leaching under drip irrigation because there was no significant relationship between the water input and gaseous nitrogen release the lines describing the changes of gaseous nitrogen loss with n fertilizer input overlapped together gaseous nitrogen loss increased linearly with n fertilizer input and a relatively lower amount was observed under drip irrigation the relationships between nue and the n fertilizer rates could be approximately described as a power function fig 8 decreasing with increasing n fertilizer input for a given amount of irrigation the nues showed a decreasing trend with increasing fertilizer inputs at the lower fertilizer application level the nues were much higher than those of the others but the cucumber yields were very low fig 6 the amounts of nitrate leaching and gaseous nitrogen loss were the lowest under the lower fertilizer application which yielded the highest nue 3 4 optimal water and nitrogen fertilizer management it was clearly shown that the more water and n fertilizer inputs that were applied the more water drainage and nitrogen loss were observed figs 6 and 8 therefore the scenarios with the lowest irrigation and n amounts 50 mm water and 60 kg n ha 1 had the lowest oov the optimal osculating value and the highest wov the worst osculating value but low cucumber yields the basic requirement for the options was that the cucumber yield was more than the average yield of this cucumber variety in this study area 100 ton ha 1 table 6 under both irrigation methods the treatments with more than 550 mm of irrigation and more than 1100 kg n ha 1 of fertilizer yielded approximately 110 ton ha 1 of cucumber the amounts of nitrate leaching and gaseous nitrogen release were very high resulting in a higher oov and a lower wov additionally the vcr was very low with regard to these options when drip irrigation was applied the amounts of irrigation and fertilizer application were reduced to 250 mm and 300 kg n ha 1 respectively and the cucumber yield was maintained at 100 600 ton ha 1 but was reduced by 8 5 compared to the maximum yield table 6 however the nue significantly increased from 152 51 to 272 12 kg kg 1 n 1 nitrate leaching and gaseous nitrogen release were reduced by 99 and 73 to only 0 55 and 43 79 kg n ha 1 while the vcr was 27 94 furthermore the values of oov and wov were the lowest and greatest respectively for furrow irrigation the treatment with 300 mm of irrigation and 300 kg n ha 1 of fertilizer had the lowest oov and the highest wov table 6 in this situation the cucumber yield reached 102 45 ton ha 1 which was only reduced by 5 7 in comparison to the maximum yield nitrate leaching and gaseous nitrogen release were only 2 96 and 42 23 kg n ha 1 while the nue was 274 41 kg kg 1 n 1 and the vcr was up to 27 14 table 6 therefore application of 250 mm of water and 300 kg n ha 1 was optimal for greenhouse cucumber yields under drip irrigation practice comparatively more water input was required and 300 mm of water with 300 kg n ha 1 was better under furrow irrigation for greenhouse cucumber production in the beijing region gao et al 2010 proposed that the highest wue and nue and good yield and quality were obtained under the application of 300 mm of water and 240 kg n ha 1 in a similar cultivation season based on a field experiment moreover an n recommendation system based on the n target value was employed for greenhouse vegetable production in china which was useful for reducing nitrogen loss and improving nue chen et al 2005 he et al 2007 2009 guo et al 2008 ren et al 2010 guo et al 2008 reported that approximately 300 kg n ha 1 under furrow irrigation was recommended by the system for cucumber growth from march to july in beijing from our simulation results the recommended optional practices were 300 kg n ha 1 with 250 or 300 mm of water under drip or furrow irrigation respectively 4 conclusions after calibration and validation using the data collected from a greenhouse field in the beijing region the eu rotate n model can be used as a helpful tool for multi goal estimation such as the responses of the cucumber yield nitrate leaching gaseous nitrogen release and nue to various water and n fertilizer rates under furrow or drip irrigation conditions the simulated results indicated that the cucumber yield increased to the maximum value as water or n fertilizer application reached a critical level but no further increase in yield with higher rates of water or n fertilizer inputs and meanwhile the environmental risk and economic cost increased linearly with increasing water input and n fertilizer rates based on results from the assessment with the osculating value method the bmp for greenhouse cucumber production in the beijing could be consist of 300 mm of irrigation water with 300 kg n ha 1 of fertilizer for the furrow irrigation method under this management the yield wue and nue were 102 4 ton ha 1 40 47 kg m 3 and 274 41 kg kg 1 respectively and for the drip irrigation method it could be 250 mm of irrigation water with 300 kg n ha 1 of fertilizer under the condition the yield wue and nue were 100 6 ton ha 1 47 98 kg m 3 and 272 12 kg kg 1 respectively while we were encouraged by the eu rotate n model for the multi goal estimation we realized that there were still limitations for widespread application of this tool firstly the model were only calibrated and validated for water and nitrate dynamics in soil profile but not for thoroughly tested against n leaching and gases emission although the simulations of these variables were critical however the datasets used in this study were the best ones currently available secondly soil heterogeneity and climate varieties would be the major obstacle for applying the model across sites thirdly the calibrated model however still slightly underestimated or overestimated soil nitrate content under the different treatments due to some model assumptions fourthly the output uncertainties associated with the quality of the available input parameters needed to be lessened this requires more efforts in the future anyhow this study will make the revised model an increasingly useful tool for evaluating multi goal management and providing bmp options for vegetable production in china we hope this paper will fuel more interest in this research area acknowledgements this
