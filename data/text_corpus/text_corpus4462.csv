years and engine types the results show that with the increase of the model year the specific emissions of pollutants increase gradually that is the stage i ships before 2000 years emit more pollutants for co the specific emissions for stage ⅱ ships between 2001 and 2010 years increase by 3 99 26 39 compared with those for stage ⅲ ships between 2011 and 2016 years and for stage i and ⅱ ships the maximum specific emissions increase by 25 34 36 95 under the same operating modes the specific emissions of thc are similar to those of co the specific emissions of thc increase by 45 84 52 97 for stage i and ⅱ ships and the weighted emissions of stage ⅱ ships are 9 37 higher than that of stage ⅲ for nox the specific emissions of stage i ⅱ and ⅲ ships are gradually reduced by 1 64 13 44 and 6 83 23 19 respectively and the specific emissions under cruise condition are increased by 16 15 36 47 compared with maneuvering condition due to the limitation of fuel products and test methods pm emission characteristics are slightly different from other pollutants for different stage ships but weighted emissions considering errors are reduced by 22 49 25 59 for different engine types the

as database given by the us environmental protection agency icf and epa 2009 swedish environmental protection agency cooper and gustafsson 2004 european commission robinson 2002 and los angeles llc 2009 due to the differences between countries and regions directly referencing these data will inevitably lead to considerable uncertainty therefore how to define proper basic emission factors

the method of onboard emission test domestic and foreign scholars have also been conducting some research huang et al 2018 studied the emission factors of nox co thc and pm emitted by a large cargo ship and analyzed the characteristics of the components of pm including organic carbon oc elemental carbon ec inorganics organic mixtures and volatile organic compounds voc the effects of engine type marine fuels and operating modes on emissions were also studied abbassi et al 2017 concluded that emissions from maneuvering conditions were significantly higher than that under cruising conditions and emphasized the importance of emissions control around the port moldanová et al 2009 also studied a large cargo ship and found that the emission factor of pm is 5 3 g kg based on the fuel consumption which is lower than the global average level of cargo ships of 5 9 7 6 g kg and co and thc are also lower than the global average values peng et al 2016 and zhang et al 2019 conducted a complete emission analysis of more than 20 different types of vessels including the emission characteristics of regulated and unregulated pollutants some others also studied the emission characteristics of particulate matters and so2 in the real world condition and compared the impact of different fuel quality on emissions lou et al 2018 2016 moldanová et al 2013 burgard and bria 2016 winnes et al 2016 as for domestic research although the emission characteristics of each ship s pollutants have been thoroughly studied in general there are few emission test data which makes it difficult to provide sufficient data support for the establishment of emission inventories in china so far domestic studies on the emission characteristics of ships with different engine types and different model years are still very limited based on the analysis of the emission test data of 50 domestic ships tested under actual navigation conditions the emission levels of different ships in china were investigated aiming to reveal and master the emission characteristics of various ocean and inland river vessels which were influenced by engine types and model years this research is aimed to provide valuable references for the calculation of ship emissions in china the establishment of emission regulations and the improvement and replacement of pollution reducing technologies 2 methodology 2 1 test system a portable emission test system pems was used to measure ship emissions including co2 co thc pm and nox nox is mainly composed of no fu et al 2018 the pems mainly consists of semtech ds gas analyzer made by sensor company of usa elpi solid state analyzer of dekati of finland secondary dilution system processor and other accessories the semtech ds gas analyzer was used to test co and co2 by non dispersive infrared ndir method no and no2 by the way of non dispersive ultraviolet nduv and total hydrocarbon thc by flame ionization detector fid the equipment of electric low pressure impactor elpi was used to measure pm by using the diffusion charging method the exhaust flow rate was detected by sensor s exhaust flow meter efm the environmental conditions and speed signal were obtained by the weather station and gps respectively yin et al 2014 the detailed parameters of pems are shown in tables 1 3 2 2 test processes and conditions before ship emission test the sub equipment efm was fastened on the ship s chimney in order that the exhaust emission can pass through this equipment without any influences on the ship s normal operation during ship emission measurement the exhaust flow was conducted into the two stage diluter and finally into elpi to test the emission of pn and pm in addition a partial flow was absorbed by semtech ds to measure emission pollutants of co2 co thc and nox the detailed testing process is shown in fig 1 ship exhaust emission are influenced by many parameters including environmental conditions and experimental conditions considering the uncontrollable weather conditions we tried to choose calm weather with gentle breeze and smooth waves and suitable temperature 10 c 35 c to carry out ship experiments on the other hand for the experimental conditions we compiled the test procedure in order to make sure the ship emission tests follow the same method and identical conditions for example we measured the ship emissions under fully warmed and steady conditions and the emission data were sampled and collected continuously for more than 30 min and should not be stopped halfway by controlling these experiment conditions at basically identical level differences between different tests were reduced greatly 2 3 test ships considering the diversity of ship categories and technical levels in order to represent the current status of china s ship emissions ships were selected according to the year of manufacture or we call ship model year classified by pre 2000 year 2000 2010 year and 2010 2016 year respectively meanwhile for each stage referring to engine speed by revolutions per minute rpm cooper and gustafsson 2004 these ships were divided into low speed ship 60 300 rpm medium speed ship 300 1000 rpm and high speed ship 1000 3000 rpm the information of ships are shown in table 4 2 4 operating modes as we know ships will produce different amounts of emissions under different operating modes when sailing on the ocean or inland river because of the uncontrollable factors under water according to the navigation characteristics of ships in the actual waterway the whole sailing process of ships can be divided into various operating modes such as berthing cruising maneuvering working and adjustment as required fu et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 2015 in this research operating modes were divided into three types namely departing cruising and hotelling peng et al 2016 the departing mode is defined as the process in which the speed of the ship changes from zero to normal cruising speed the hotelling mode is defined as the process in which the ship decelerates and then stays in anchor state the cruising mode is defined as the process while the ship travels by normal speed on the waterway except departing or hotelling modes the ship typical operating modes are shown in fig 2 2 5 data processing since ocean vessels or ordinary vessels basically adopted diesel engines as the power output device this research referred to the current mature methods used for diesel vehicle emission calculation when calculating ship emission factors ministry of ecological environment 2018 mass based emission factors were calculated by the following equation 1 e f i u i g i c o n c g e x h where e f i is the mass based emission factor for pollutant i kg h u i is the ratio of exhaust component density to exhaust density g i c o n c is the instantaneous concentration of the emission under standard condition 10 6 g e x h is the instantaneous exhaust mass flow rate under standard condition kg h thousands of records of data for each ship will be exported from the pems system parameters g i c o n c and g e x h were obtained directly from pems and we calculated the average value separately according to different operating modes then we used equation 1 to calculate emission factors for different pollutants according to the national standard limits and measurement method for exhaust pollutants from marine engines power based emission factors were commonly used to measure the level of emission therefore the method to calculate the instantaneous power for a single ship was particularly important according to the propelling characteristics of the ship propeller there was a certain linear relationship between the power of the main engine and the third power of the main engine speed lou et al 2018 normally the rated speed and rated power were given if we measured the instantaneous speed of the engine the instantaneous power of the engine can be calculated by equation 2 2 p c n 3 where p is the instantaneous power kw n is the instantaneous rotational speed of the engine r min c is a parameter related to rated speed and rated power of the main engine 1 2 6 fuel types the sample of fuel collected from each ship were transferred to a special testing institution for analysis according to the test results the sulfur content was generally 1 7 for low speed engines and 0 035 for medium and high speed engines 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of model year on ship emissions in order to reflect the impact of ships for different model years on emissions each ship data was classified according to the model year of the ship to further analyze emission characteristics so different ships were divided into three categories namely ships before 2000 years ships between 2001 and 2010 year and ships between 2011 and 2016 year at the same time the emission characteristics under different operating modes were also analyzed in order to facilitate writing the above three periods were respectively recorded as stage i ⅱ and ⅲ as shown in fig 3 the specific emissions of various pollutants generally increased with model years and stage i ships produced more emissions for the pollutant of co the specific emissions under different operating modes were reduced by about 3 99 26 39 from stage ⅱ to stage ⅲ since the change of mean emissions was not obvious on stage i and stage ⅱ therefore the impact of errors on emissions under different operating modes were analyzed as follows in terms of departing mode the specific emissions increased by 25 34 for stage i compared with that of stage ⅱ while under hotelling mode and cruising mode the specific emissions increased by a maximum of 32 83 and 36 95 respectively besides ships with different model years showed the same emission trend under various operating modes and the specific emissions under departing mode and hotelling mode were significantly higher than those emissions emitted under cruising mode when ships leave or arrive at the port it is necessary to restart and stop the main engine frequently to control the speed and adjust the heading direction these operations made the engine load changing drastically as a consequence the air and fuel in the engine cylinder were not evenly mixed the fuel was not completely burned and the combustion in the engine cylinder deteriorated leading to increased emissions of co peng et al 2016 yin et al 2014 for the pollutant of nox the specific emissions under different operating modes between stages i ⅱ and ⅲ were gradually reduced decreasing by 1 64 13 44 and 6 83 23 19 these were corresponding to the provisions of annex vi of imo s marpol conventions which emphasized that the emission of nox needed to be decreased by 15 29 21 43 between tier i to tier ⅱ wu 2006 in general the specific emissions under cruising mode were higher than the other two operating modes and with the increase of ship service life the gap became more and more obvious the maximum increase of emission emitted under cruising mode was 24 59 27 48 compared with the departing and hotelling modes in stage i while in stage ⅱ and ⅲ these growths were 16 15 23 02 and 16 06 36 47 respectively the main reason for these differences was that the engine load under cruising mode was low stable intake airflow and sufficient oxygen content in each cylinder promoted the complete combustion of fuels resulting in high combustion temperature in the cylinder which is favorable to the production of nox especially for the hot no zhang et al 2018 for the pollutant of thc the specific emissions in stage i were higher than that in stage ⅱ and were increased by approximately 45 84 52 97 under different operating modes however the change of specific emissions between stage ⅱ and ⅲ was not obvious and even the specific emissions under departing mode in stage ⅲ were 23 92 higher than those in stage ⅱ but for weighted emissions those were relatively reduced by 9 37 in general the characteristics of specific emissions under different operating modes were similar to that of co meanwhile the specific emissions under cruising mode were lower than emissions under the other two operating modes with incomplete combustion for the pollutant of pm the emission characteristics in each stage were different from the characteristics for other pollutants the specific emissions were gradually reduced at each stage when ships were sailing under hotelling mode instead these emissions were gradually increased under departing mode unlike the other two operating modes the specific emissions under cruising mode were raised first and then decreased considering the impact of errors on the results the weighted emissions in stage i increased by 22 49 compared with emissions in stage ⅱ and these emissions decreased by 25 59 from stage ⅱ to stage ⅲ the main reason for this difference was partly due to the limitation of test methods at present the most accurate method to measure pm was weighing filter paper and that was difficult to apply in real world ship experiment therefore most portable instruments used the method of measuring particle numbers and particle size ranges to calculate pm quality but this method can increase the uncertainty of each test result on the other hand the generation of particulate matters was related to the sulfur content of fuels to some extent although the international maritime organization had repeatedly imposed restrictions on the sulfur content of marine fuels wu 2006 most ship owners still choose to use low quality high sulfur marine fuels for lower cost this behavior made the sulfur content of fuels for different ships unrecognizable and ultimately led to differences in pm emissions at each stage 3 2 impact of engine type on ship emissions according to the ais decoding information the two most important parameters were engine rotational speed and engine power which can be used to describe different types of engines there was a corresponding relationship between these two parameters the slow speed engine represents the huge diesel engine with higher power and lower engine speed on the contrary the high speed engine represents small or medium engine with lower power working at high speed range in this research the engine type was classified according to the engine rotational speed since the ship emission test process of the slow speed engine under real world conditions was limited by many factors and the number of ships measured in each stage was small especially in stage i the number of slow speed engine is zero therefore it can be seen from fig 4 the emission errors for different pollutants released by the slow speed engine are relatively high at each stage because of the shortage of test samples and the error line ranged from 30 65 to 76 79 for the pollutant of co the specific emissions of high speed engines at each stage are significantly higher than those of medium speed engines which are increased by about 16 05 36 61 the main reason is that the medium speed engine had lower rotational speed and the fuel and air are mixed more perfectly in the cylinder leading to a better combustion than high speed engines therefore the medium speed engine produces lower co emissions at the same time the stage ⅲ slow speed engine also emits lower emissions which is decreased by 40 30 than those of medium speed engines but the specific emissions from stage ⅱ slow speed engines are dramatically high which may be caused by test errors and insufficient samples for the pollutant of nox the characteristics of emissions for various types of engines are opposite to those characteristics of co the specific emissions of medium speed engines at each stage are significantly higher than those of high speed engines which is increased by 8 21 8 82 that s mainly because the complete combustion of fuels for medium speed engines increases the in cylinder combustion temperature which is good for the generation of nox another reason is the longer mixing time of fuel and air in the engine cylinder and high oxygen content is also an important factor for the generation of nox zhang et al 2018 considering the analyzed errors the specific emissions emitted from slow speed engines in stage ⅱ and stage ⅲ have the same characteristics which can produce higher emissions compared with that of other two types of engines in stage ⅱ the specific emissions of slow speed engines are 21 47 higher than those of medium speed engines while in stage ⅲ these emissions are likely to increase by 26 93 at the same time the emissions emitted from different types of engines at different stages are gradually reduced which corresponds to the increasingly stringent emission regulations in the world for the pollutant of thc the characteristics of emissions for medium and high speed engines in each stage are similar to those characteristics of co in other words the specific emissions of high speed engines at each stage are higher than emissions emitted from medium speed engines and increased by 73 31 6 52 and 39 88 respectively the main reason also contributed to the combustion condition in the cylinder and the opposite characteristics of slow speed engines are caused by the measurement errors for the pollutant of pm the specific emissions for medium and high speed engines in stage ⅱ and stage ⅲ decrease gradually with the highest reduction of 45 88 in stage ⅱ and 84 86 in stage ⅲ but the characteristics of these two types of engines in stage i were opposite to other stages and the specific emissions increased by 75 07 for high speed engines compared with medium speed engines the main reason for this difference is that different types of engines may use fuels with different sulfur content or even burn ordinary diesel oil which would affect the formation of particulate matters to some extent kong et al 2006 in other words it is impossible to ensure that every type of engines used the same fuel when conducting the test of engine emission for different stages leading to an uncontrollable variation of the characteristics of pm emission since the results shown in fig 4 are based on statistics from different model year groups it can be seen that there is a certain relationship between different pollutants and the difference of model years does not change this relationship significantly therefore in order to figure out the relationship between different pollutants and the relationship between different engine types the influence of ship model years was ignored here and only the change of ship specific emissions was considered it can be seen from fig 5 that the emission characteristics of thc and co are consistent compared with slow and high speed engines the medium speed engine has lower specific emissions and the specific emissions of high speed engines are slightly larger than the emissions of slow speed engines which are consistent with the results in fig 4 the variation of the specific emissions of nox with engine type is basically consistent with that of pm with the increase of engine rotational speed the specific emissions decrease gradually which is consistent with part of the results in fig 4 3 3 comparison of emission factors in different countries since many countries currently used several fixed databases to calculate emissions in different years when compiling emissions inventories zhang et al 2017 these databases were basically derived by measuring different ships in stage ⅱ and even in stage i in order to verify these values used to calculate the emissions inventories by domestic and foreign scholars the results of this study were compared with several foreign databases to determine whether it is suitable for the establishment of national emissions inventories in china cooper and gustafsson 2004 icf and epa 2009 llc 2009 robinson 2002 since ship samples in stage ⅱ were sufficient the measured data at this stage was used to compare with the foreign data the results were shown in fig 6 this research showed that in our country the specific emissions of different pollutants measured in the real world conditions were higher than the emission data from other countries meanwhile the emission values provided by the european commission and the us environmental protection agency were more closed to the real values measured in our country but there were still many differences for slow speed engines the specific emissions of different pollutants measured in our country were about 1 18 5 11 times higher than those of other countries for medium and high speed engines these multiples are about 1 2 3 times and 1 1 4 71 times respectively it can be seen that if foreign data are used directly to calculate china s emissions inventories the actual level of emission will be underestimated 4 conclusions in this research the specific emissions of different types of ship were tested using pems and analyzed according to the model year and speed range it can be concluded that the specific emissions of different pollutants are increasing with the growth of the model year that is to say the ships which were built before 2000 years can emit much more emissions for the pollutant of co and thc the specific emissions of stage ⅱ ship under different operating modes were increased by 3 99 26 39 compared with that of stage ⅲ and the specific emissions of stage i ship increased by 45 84 52 97 compared with that of stage ⅱ to stage i while for nox with the increase of the model year the specific emissions increased by 6 83 23 19 and 1 64 13 44 respectively for stage ⅱ and stage ⅲ for pm although there were no obvious characteristics under different operating modes the weighted emissions were decreased separately by 22 49 and 25 59 from stage i to ⅱ and stage ⅲ the influence of engine types on specific emissions of co was the same as thc and the specific emissions of medium speed engines decreased by 16 05 36 61 for co and 3 52 73 31 for thc compared with those of high speed engines in each stage while the emission characteristics of nox were opposite the specific nox emissions of high speed engines were decreased by 8 21 8 82 compared with those of medium speed engines and there were no obvious tendency for emissions characteristics of pm within three stages meanwhile it can be seen that if we directly use the foreign database to calculate emissions inventories that will lead to big error obtaining localized ship emission factors are very important for calculating local ship emission inventories acknowledgments this research was supported by the project of second national census of

h thousands of records of data for each ship will be exported from the pems system parameters g i c o n c and g e x h were obtained directly from pems and we calculated the average value separately according to different operating modes then we used equation 1 to calculate emission factors for different pollutants according to the national standard limits and measurement method for exhaust pollutants from marine engines power based emission factors were commonly used to measure the level of emission therefore the method to calculate the instantaneous power for a single ship was particularly important according to the propelling characteristics of the ship propeller there was a certain linear relationship between the power of the main engine and the third power of the main engine speed lou et al 2018 normally the rated speed and rated power were given if we measured the instantaneous speed of the engine the instantaneous power of the engine can be calculated by equation 2 2 p c n 3 where p is the instantaneous power kw n is the instantaneous rotational speed of the engine r min c is a parameter related to rated speed and rated power of the main engine 1 2 6 fuel types the sample of fuel collected from each ship were transferred to a special testing institution for analysis according to the test results the sulfur content was generally 1 7 for low speed engines and 0 035 for medium and high speed engines 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of model year on ship emissions in order to reflect the impact of ships for different model years on emissions each ship data was classified according to the model year of the ship to further analyze emission characteristics so different ships were divided into three categories namely ships before 2000 years ships between 2001 and 2010 year and ships between 2011 and 2016 year at the same time the emission characteristics under different operating modes were also analyzed in order to facilitate writing the above three periods were respectively recorded as stage i ⅱ and ⅲ as shown in fig 3 the specific emissions of various pollutants generally increased with model years and stage i ships produced more emissions for the pollutant of co the specific emissions under different operating modes were reduced by about 3 99 26 39 from stage ⅱ to stage ⅲ since the change of mean emissions was not obvious on stage i and stage ⅱ therefore the impact of errors on emissions under different operating modes were analyzed as follows in terms of departing mode the specific emissions increased by 25 34 for stage i compared with that of stage ⅱ while under hotelling mode and cruising mode the specific emissions increased by a maximum of 32 83 and 36 95 respectively besides ships with different model years showed the same emission trend under various operating modes and the specific emissions under departing mode and hotelling mode were significantly higher than those emissions emitted under cruising mode when ships leave or arrive at the port it is necessary to restart and stop the main engine frequently to control the speed and adjust the heading direction these operations made the engine load changing drastically as a consequence the air and fuel in the engine cylinder were not evenly mixed the fuel was not completely burned and the combustion in the engine cylinder deteriorated leading to increased emissions of co peng et al 2016 yin et al 2014 for the pollutant of nox the specific emissions under different operating modes between stages i ⅱ and ⅲ were gradually reduced decreasing by 1 64 13 44 and 6 83 23 19 these were corresponding to the provisions of annex vi of imo s marpol conventions which emphasized that the emission of nox needed to be decreased by 15 29 21 43 between tier i to tier ⅱ wu 2006 in general the specific emissions under cruising mode were higher than the other two operating modes and with the increase of ship service life the gap became more and more obvious the maximum increase of emission emitted under cruising mode was 24 59 27 48 compared with the departing and hotelling modes in stage i while in stage ⅱ and ⅲ these growths were 16 15 23 02 and 16 06 36 47 respectively the main reason for these differences was that the engine load under cruising mode was low stable intake airflow and sufficient oxygen content in each cylinder promoted the complete combustion of fuels resulting in high combustion temperature in the cylinder which is favorable to the production of nox especially for the hot no zhang et al 2018 for the pollutant of thc the specific emissions in stage i were higher than that in stage ⅱ and were increased by approximately 45 84 52 97 under different operating modes however the change of specific emissions between stage ⅱ and ⅲ was not obvious and even the specific emissions under departing mode in stage ⅲ were 23 92 higher than those in stage ⅱ but for weighted emissions those were relatively reduced by 9 37 in general the characteristics of specific emissions under different operating modes were similar to that of co meanwhile the specific emissions under cruising mode were lower than emissions under the other two operating modes with incomplete combustion for the pollutant of pm the emission characteristics in each stage were different from the characteristics for other pollutants the specific emissions were gradually reduced at each stage when ships were sailing under hotelling mode instead these emissions were gradually increased under departing mode unlike the other two operating modes the specific emissions under cruising mode were raised first and then decreased considering the impact of errors on the results the weighted emissions in stage i increased by 22 49 compared with emissions in stage ⅱ and these emissions decreased by 25 59 from stage ⅱ to stage ⅲ the main reason for this difference was partly due to the limitation of test methods at present the most accurate method to measure pm was weighing filter paper and that was difficult to apply in real world ship experiment therefore most portable instruments used the method of measuring particle numbers and particle size ranges to calculate pm quality but this method can increase the uncertainty of each test result on the other hand the generation of particulate matters was related to the sulfur content of fuels to some extent although the international maritime organization had repeatedly imposed restrictions on the sulfur content of marine fuels wu 2006 most ship owners still choose to use low quality high sulfur marine fuels for lower cost this behavior made the sulfur content of fuels for different ships unrecognizable and ultimately led to differences in pm emissions at each stage 3 2 impact of engine type on ship emissions according to the ais decoding information the two most important parameters were engine rotational speed and engine power which can be used to describe different types of engines there was a corresponding relationship between these two parameters the slow speed engine represents the huge diesel engine with higher power and lower engine speed on the contrary the high speed engine represents small or medium engine with lower power working at high speed range in this research the engine type was classified according to the engine rotational speed since the ship emission test process of the slow speed engine under real world conditions was limited by many factors and the number of ships measured in each stage was small especially in stage i the number of slow speed engine is zero therefore it can be seen from fig 4 the emission errors for different pollutants released by the slow speed engine are relatively high at each stage because of the shortage of test samples and the error line ranged from 30 65 to 76 79 for the pollutant of co the specific emissions of high speed engines at each stage are significantly higher than those of medium speed engines which are increased by about 16 05 36 61 the main reason is that the medium speed engine had lower rotational speed and the fuel and air are mixed more perfectly in the cylinder leading to a better combustion than high speed engines therefore the medium speed engine produces lower co emissions at the same time the stage ⅲ slow speed engine also emits lower emissions which is decreased by 40 30 than those of medium speed engines but the specific emissions from stage ⅱ slow speed engines are dramatically high which may be caused by test errors and insufficient samples for the pollutant of nox the characteristics of emissions for various types of engines are opposite to those characteristics of co the specific emissions of medium speed engines at each stage are significantly higher than those of high speed engines which is increased by 8 21 8 82 that s mainly because the complete combustion of fuels for medium speed engines increases the in cylinder combustion temperature which is good for the generation of nox another reason is the longer mixing time of fuel and air in the engine cylinder and high oxygen content is also an important factor for the generation of nox zhang et al 2018 considering the analyzed errors the specific emissions emitted from slow speed engines in stage ⅱ and stage ⅲ have the same characteristics which can produce higher emissions compared with that of other two types of engines in stage ⅱ the specific emissions of slow speed engines are 21 47 higher than those of medium speed engines while in stage ⅲ these emissions are likely to increase by 26 93 at the same time the emissions emitted from different types of engines at different stages are gradually reduced which corresponds to the increasingly stringent emission regulations in the world for the pollutant of thc the characteristics of emissions for medium and high speed engines in each stage are similar to those characteristics of co in other words the specific emissions of high speed engines at each stage are higher than emissions emitted from medium speed engines and increased by 73 31 6 52 and 39 88 respectively the main reason also contributed to the combustion condition in the cylinder and the opposite characteristics of slow speed engines are caused by the measurement errors for the pollutant of pm the specific emissions for medium and high speed engines in stage ⅱ and stage ⅲ decrease gradually with the highest reduction of 45 88 in stage ⅱ and 84 86 in stage ⅲ but the characteristics of these two types of engines in stage i were opposite to other stages and the specific emissions increased by 75 07 for high speed engines compared with medium speed engines the main reason for this difference is that different types of engines may use fuels with different sulfur content or even burn ordinary diesel oil which would affect the formation of particulate matters to some extent kong et al 2006 in other words it is impossible to ensure that every type of engines used the same fuel when conducting the test of engine emission for different stages leading to an uncontrollable variation of the characteristics of pm emission since the results shown in fig 4 are based on statistics from different model year groups it can be seen that there is a certain relationship between different pollutants and the difference of model years does not change this relationship significantly therefore in order to figure out the relationship between different pollutants and the relationship between different engine types the influence of ship model years was ignored here and only the change of ship specific emissions was considered it can be seen from fig 5 that the emission characteristics of thc and co are consistent compared with slow and high speed engines the medium speed engine has lower specific emissions and the specific emissions of high speed engines are slightly larger than the emissions of slow speed engines which are consistent with the results in fig 4 the variation of the specific emissions of nox with engine type is basically consistent with that of pm with the increase of engine rotational speed the specific emissions decrease gradually which is consistent with part of the results in fig 4 3 3 comparison of emission factors in different countries since many countries currently used several fixed databases to calculate emissions in different years when compiling emissions inventories zhang et al 2017 these databases were basically derived by measuring different ships in stage ⅱ and even in stage i in order to verify these values used to calculate the emissions inventories by domestic and foreign scholars the results of this study were compared with several foreign databases to determine whether it is suitable for the establishment of national emissions inventories in china cooper and gustafsson 2004 icf and epa 2009 llc 2009 robinson 2002 since ship samples in stage ⅱ were sufficient the measured data at this stage was used to compare with the foreign data the results were shown in fig 6 this research showed that in our country the specific emissions of different pollutants measured in the real world conditions were higher than the emission data from other countries meanwhile the emission values provided by the european commission and the us environmental protection agency were more closed to the real values measured in our country but there were still many differences for slow speed engines the specific emissions of different pollutants measured in our country were about 1 18 5 11 times higher than those of other countries for medium and high speed engines these multiples are about 1 2 3 times and 1 1 4 71 times respectively it can be seen that if foreign data are used directly to calculate china s emissions inventories the actual level of emission will be underestimated 4 conclusions in this research the specific emissions of different types of ship were tested using pems and analyzed according to the model year and speed range it can be concluded that the specific emissions of different pollutants are increasing with the growth of the model year that is to say the ships which were built before 2000 years can emit much more emissions for the pollutant of co and thc the specific emissions of stage ⅱ ship under different operating modes were increased by 3 99 26 39 compared with that of stage ⅲ and the specific emissions of stage i ship increased by 45 84 52 97 compared with that of stage ⅱ to stage i while for nox with the increase of the model year the specific emissions increased by 6 83 23 19 and 1 64 13 44 respectively for stage ⅱ and stage ⅲ for pm although there were no obvious characteristics under different operating modes the weighted emissions were decreased separately by 22 49 and 25 59 from stage i to ⅱ and stage ⅲ the influence of engine types on specific emissions of co was the same as thc and the specific emissions of medium speed engines decreased by 16 05 36 61 for co and 3 52 73 31 for thc compared with those of high speed engines in each stage while the emission characteristics of nox were opposite the specific nox emissions of high speed engines were decreased by 8 21 8 82 compared with those of medium speed engines and there were no obvious tendency for emissions characteristics of pm within three stages meanwhile it can be seen that if we directly use the foreign database to calculate emissions inventories that will lead to big error

22311,a theoretical approach is applied to investigate wave induced mixing the problem is formulated to describe evolution of temperature in a layer of fluid and is solved by applying eigenfunction expansions the derived semi analytical solution is applied to predict temperature changes and evolution of temperature profiles due to mechanically generated waves in a closed flume the results show that water waves modify the temperature distribution in space and time the analysis shows that the changes occur in the whole layer of fluid the results indicate that time is a more important factor in a process of wave induced mixing than expected mixing processes depend on a wave height the rate of change of temperature distribution is more pronounced for higher waves another important parameter in mixing processes is the wavelength the mixing effects are more distinct for deep water waves the sensitivity analysis implies a need to conduct more theoretical studies and experimental investigations on wave induced mixing the model is verified in the course of the original laboratory experiments that were conducted in the insulated flume a reasonable agreement between predicted and

2006 song et al 2007 the role of waves in vertical mixing may be evaluated by conducting laboratory experiments in a wave flume babanin and haus 2009 dai et al 2010 sulisz and paprota 2015 laboratory experiments have been shown to be useful in the studies of many wave induced processes experiments in a wave flume are the source of basic information on wave induced processes and are essential in the analysis of the physics of wave induced mixing phenomenon moreover laboratory experiments allow to separate the mixing originated from breaking and non breaking processes this is of fundamental importance for calibration of wave induced mixing models the experiments conducted for nonlinear waves provide insight into the physics of wave induced mixing the recorded changes of temperature profiles are realistic and resemble vertical distributions of temperature recorded in the upper ocean however data obtained in laboratory experiments are contaminated by undesirable side effects a preliminary analysis of data collected by dai et al 2010 indicate that in some cases side effects may be significant despite the progress made in arranging and conducting laboratory experiments to get insight and knowledge on wave induced mixing processes including various novel techniques experimental data collected in a wave flume have numerous limitations and drawbacks and often may not be applied to explain many phenomena observed in field campaigns and in situ measurements there is evidently a need to develop advanced theoretical models describing wave generation propagation and wave induced mixing effects to further study the features of wave induced mixing processes an attractive alternative to available approaches is to apply a semi analytical solution that satisfies a boundary value problem of the considered physical process and to satisfy the remaining boundary conditions by a proper selection of the coefficients of the proposed solution or by applying more complex techniques sulisz and paprota 2004 2008 in this work theoretical studies are conducted to investigate wave induced mixing first the theoretical approach to the two dimensional problem of wave driven evolution of water temperature structure in a closed flume is developed then the derived numerical model is applied to provide insight into a potential origin of wave induced mixing the theoretical results are compared with experimental data obtained from original laboratory experiments conducted in the wave flume finally theoretical and experimental data are analyzed with emphasis on factors and wave parameters affecting mixing processes and the conclusions are specified 2 theory 2 1 particle kinematics the problem of generation and propagation of nonlinear water waves in a wave flume and the effects of generated waves on wave induced mixing is considered a right hand cartesian coordinate system is selected such that the x axis is horizontal and coincides with the undisturbed free surface and z points vertically upwards fig 1 it is assumed that the motion of the inviscid and incompressible fluid is irrotational the horizontal flume bottom and vertical wavemaker paddle are impervious according to the assumptions the velocity vector v x z t has a potential φ x z t such that v φ the fluid motion is governed by the laplace equation 1a 2 φ 0 and the bernoulli equation 1b φ t 1 ρ p g z 1 2 φ 2 0 where ρ is the fluid density p is the pressure g is the acceleration due to gravity the velocity potential φ x z t satisfies the laplace equation 2a 2 φ 0 at the free surface the velocity potential φ x z t has to satisfy the kinematic boundary condition 2b η t φ x η x φ z 0 z η x t and the dynamic boundary condition 2c φ t g η 1 2 φ x 2 φ z 2 0 z η x t at the wavemaker the velocity potential φ x z t has to satisfy the kinematic boundary condition 2d χ t φ z χ z φ x 0 x χ z t at the sea bottom the following boundary condition must be satisfied 2e φ z 0 z h moreover the velocity potential must satisfy boundary conditions at infinity and initial conditions wehausen 1960 it is not a trivial task to solve the boundary value problem 2 this is because the boundary conditions at the free surface and at the wavemaker contain nonlinear terms moreover the boundary conditions must be applied on the free surface which is unknown and is a part of a final solution wehausen 1960 the kinematic free surface boundary condition the dynamic free surface boundary condition and the kinematic wavemaker boundary condition are often expanded in a taylor series about a mean position 3a n 0 η n n n z n η t φ x η x φ z 0 z 0 3b n 0 η n n n z n φ t g η 1 2 φ x 2 φ z 2 0 z 0 3c n 0 χ n n n x n χ t φ z χ z φ x 0 x 0 which usually helps to obtain a solution dean and

4 can also be achieved analytically sulisz and hudspeth 1993 the solution procedure is complicated because of a need to satisfy the kinematic wavemaker boundary condition the form of the solution is very complex and is not provided here simplifications are possible only far away from the wavemaker where the time dependent part of the solution takes the following form which is well recognized from wave theories 5a φ x z t a 1 g ω cosh k 1 z h cosh k 1 h sin k 1 x ω t 3 8 ω a 1 2 cosh 2 k 1 z h sinh 4 k 1 h sin 2 k 1 x ω t a 2 g 2 ω cosh k 2 z h cosh k 2 h sin k 2 x 2 ω t η x t a 1 cos k 1 x ω t

k 2 are the wave numbers ω is the frequency 2 2 wave induced mixing in order to describe the wave induced mixing process and predict changes of temperature distribution in space and time a boundary value problem for an advection diffusion equation is formulated it is assumed that the changes of temperature distribution in space and time are only due to wave induced velocities and diffusion processes which are governed by the following advection diffusion equation 6 t t u t x w t z x κ t x z κ t z where t denotes the water temperature t is the time u and w are the wave induced horizontal and vertical velocity components κ is the diffusion coefficient a theoretical analysis indicates that the diffusion coefficient may be represented as a sum of the molecular and wave induced diffusivities 7a κ κ m κ v where κ m 1 4 10 7 m2 s is the background molecular diffusivity and κ v represents the wave induced diffusivity derived by sulisz and paprota 2015 as 7b κ v α a 1 3 k 1 ω sinh 2 k 1 z h cosh k 1 z h sinh 3 k 1 h where α is the dimensionless coefficient which should be determined by observations or numerical experiments the expression derived for the wave induced diffusivity allows water waves to be incorporated in a mixing process in a simplified manner as a consequence the temperature in the water column and its time evolving profiles depend on wave parameters the initial boundary value problem for t x z t may be written as follows 8a t t u t x w t z x κ t x z κ t z at the free water surface the temperature t x z t must satisfy the following condition 8b ν t t z 0 z 0 at the wavemaker the horizontal gradient of t x z t must vanish 8c t x 0 x 0 at the bottom boundary the following condition must be satisfied 8d t z 0 z h far away from disturbance the horizontal changes in temperature may be neglected 8e t x 0 x provided that 8f t z t 0 z t 0 where t 0 z is assumed to be the known temperature distribution in the water column at t 0 the condition 8b accounts for partial radiation at the oscillating free surface which is observed in physical experiments this type of conditions are widely applied in the modeling of many physical phenomena in general ν may be a complex value quantity which often facilitates the modeling process the solution of 8 is achieved by a time stepping procedure consisting of an application of an eigenfunction expansion method to describe t and the adams bashford moulton predictor corrector or runge kutta formulas to proceed in time press et al 1988 this method has been shown to be an efficient technique in the modeling of the propagation and transformation of nonlinear water waves sulisz and paprota 2004 2011 2013 accordingly the solution takes the following form 9a t 1 x z t m 1 n 1 a m n t cos λ m 0 x b cos λ 0 n z h provided that the eigenvalues satisfy 9b ν 1 λ m 0 tan λ m 0 b 0 ν 3 λ 0 n tan λ 0 n h 0 the coefficients of the eigenfunction expansions are determined by applying the fourier method canuto et al 1988 the application of the eigenfunction expansions and the fourier method makes the solution procedure very efficient and enables to obtain results even for large spatial or time domains the form of 9 allows the radiation to be incorporated at the boundary of the fluid domain in order to simplify the approach and speed up calculations radiation was omitted in the analysis of theoretical results the initial boundary value problem 8 is solved by applying the following numerical procedure first the wave induced diffusivity and velocities are determined using eq 7b and by applying the method reported in hudspeth and sulisz 1991 respectively for given selected wave parameters then the time stepping scheme is employed to advance the solution in time starting from the initial condition 8f in the present study the classical fourth order runge kutta method is applied eq 8a is used to determine the values of time derivative of temperature t in order to calculate spatial derivatives of t appearing in eq 8 the eigenfunction expansion 9a with eigenvalues 9b is used the unknown coefficients a mn are determined by applying a two dimensional cosine fast fourier transform 2 3 theoretical results the numerical model derived to describe wave induced mixing processes and predict changes of temperature distribution in space and time is applied to study the changes of temperature distribution in a semi infinite layer of the fluid triggered by water waves the main attention is paid to the effect of a return current on mixing phenomenon the calculations are conducted for the basic parameters of the model including time wave heights wave lengths etc typical temperature distribution in a layer of fluid arising from wave induced mixing is presented in fig 2 the plot shows the temperature distribution in the sector of a channel of length 3h for the amplitude of the incident wave a 1 h 0 05 the results indicate that the initial temperature distribution is altered by waves the initial values of temperature t z used in all numerical tests are provided in table 1 the influence of waves may be deduced from the changes of temperate profiles along the channel the main changes occur in the sector close to the wavemaker paddle in fact changes of temperate distribution occur in the whole layer of fluid however for a relatively short period of time considered here most distinguished changes occur in a sector close to the wavemaker in the area affected by the wavemaker the wave field is very complex due to the wave radiation formation of evanescent modes and mode attenuation the complexity of wave induced mixing effects indicates that the temperature field in a sector affected by the wavemaker should be analyzed individually in each case to illustrate the process of vertical mixing induced by surface waves a number of additional numerical tests is performed and presented in following graphs in fig 3 a spatial distribution of water temperature for wave conditions corresponding to the depth parameter kh 0 5 1 1 5 and 2 and the depth relative amplitude a 1 h 0 025 0 05 and 0 1 are presented after 100 s of propagation of mechanically generated waves in the flume it can be seen from the graphs presented in fig 3 that the effect of wavelength and amplitude is apparent for lower values of amplitude and lower depths the mixing process is slower the highest intensity of wave induced mixing is visible for kh 2 and a 1 h 0 1 a more detailed description of the effect of wave amplitude and wavelength is provided below together with the graphical representation the effect of time on the temperature distribution in the considered layer of fluid is shown in fig 4 the plots clearly indicate the changes of temperature distribution arising from wave induced mixing the changes are most pronounced in the first sector of the channel the analysis shows that the main changes in this sector are due to the action of a return flow however changes of temperate distribution occur in the whole layer of fluid the plots indicate that time is a more important factor in the process of wave induced mixing than expected the effects of wave height on the changes of temperature distribution in the considered sector of the fluid are depicted in fig 5 the effect of a wave height on wave induced mixing is evident the process of wave induced mixing depends on a wave height and the results indicate that the rate of change of the temperature distribution grows with increasing the wave height the analysis indicates that the wave height is an important factor in the process of wave induced mixing the next important wave parameter affecting the temperature distribution is the wavelength fig 6 the results indicate that the changes of temperature distribution are complex and are becoming more pronounced for deep water waves the analysis shows that the complexity of wave induced mixing effects arise from high velocity gradients in the deep water upper layer the significant effect of wavelength and in consequence a frequency structure of a particular wave field on wave induced mixing conform a need to include spectral analysis in the study of mixing effects in figs 7 and 8 the dependences of the normalised spatially averaged temperature as a function of depth parameter kh and depth relative amplitude a h over the rectangular fluid domain extending from water surface down to the bottom and from the wavemaker to the vertical boundary located 3 depths from the wavemaker are presented it can be seen that the average temperature changes intensity in the vicinity of the wavemaker paddle grows as the wavelength decreases kh increases fig 7 the growth of intensity of changes is linear in this case in turn the rate of change of temperature grows with increasing wave amplitude in a non linear fashion 3 laboratory experiments 3 1 wave flume setup the verification of the presented approach was performed in the wave flume owned by the institute of hydro engineering polish academy of sciences gdańsk the flume is equipped with a programmable piston type wavemaker driven by an ac motor connected to the electric control system preliminary stage of the laboratory activities was devoted to the design of the insulated section of the flume in the separated part of width b 0 3 m that is shown schematically in fig 9 during the experiments the water depth was h 0 4 m an array of electrical heaters was immersed into water to heat up the upper layer of the fluid after the system of heaters was removed the flume was covered by insulation plates in order to maintain an initial steady thermal state of the system characterised by the vertical temperature profile t 0 z insulation was also used to reduce heat losses due to radiation during the tests the temperature gauge constituted a sensor installed on a vertical measuring rod the distance from the gauge to the wavemaker paddle was x 9 2 m the focus of experimental investigations was put on the effect of surface waves on the vertical mixing process after the system of electrical heaters was lifted and removed the temperature profile over depth was measured the measurements were conducted every 0 01 m then a train of regular waves of fixed wave height h 0 04 m and wavelength l 0 8 m was generated for 120 s when the waves and internal waves decayed the temperature profile over depth was measured again to provide information on the effect of surface waves on vertical mixing process the resulting time interval between two successive temperature profile registrations was 3600 s 3 2 experimental results the results of laboratory experiments are presented in fig 10 the graphs show the measured temperature profiles of the initial temperature distribution and the final distribution over the depth the comparisons between theoretical results and experimental data for the final temperature distribution are also presented in fig 10 the validation of the theoretical model was performed for α 0 002 that was assessed based on the results of previous studies sulisz and paprota 2015 according to the following procedure first the initial measured temperature profile was used as an initial condition of the boundary value problem 8 then for 120 s the profile was modified by waves taking into account the diffusivity described by equation 7 simultaneously the temperature structure was evolving due to the wave induced advection governed by the advective terms of equation 6 after 120 s the waves vanished and the temperature structure of the system was modified by the molecular diffusion it should be noted that although the efforts were made in order to separate the measuring section by insulation plates some radiation of heat was observed during the experiment the derived model accounts for the partial radiation at the water surface by the application of the boundary condition 8b in the fig 10 theoretical values are provided both for adiabatic and non adiabatic conditions it can be seen that incorporating radiation into the boundary value problem 8 improves the accuracy of the theoretical results in the upper part of the water column as a matter of fact the heat radiation may also be significant at the wave flume walls and the wavemaker paddle the construction of the radiation free measuring section in the wave flume is a challengeable task it is difficult to evaluate the intensity of these processes without further comprehensive experimental studies on wave induced vertical mixing processes supported by reliable theoretical models 4 summary a theoretical approach is applied to study wave induced vertical mixing an initial boundary value problem was formulated to describe the evolution of temperature in a layer of fluid under propagating water waves and was solved by applying eigenfunction expansions and a time stepping procedure the derived semi analytical solution was applied to predict water temperature changes and evolution of temperature profiles due to mechanically generated waves in a closed flume the results show that the temperature distribution in a semi infinite layer of fluid arising from wave induced mixing is altered by generated waves the most distinguished changes occur in the first sector of the channel the analysis shows that the main changes in this sector are due to the action of a return flow as time evolves changes of temperature distribution occur in the whole layer of fluid the results indicate that time is a more important factor in the process of wave induced mixing than expected this information is of significant importance in the experimental study of wave induced processes as the lack of knowledge on side effects of the experimental apparatus may often lead to false conclusions the sensitivity analysis of wave parameters indicates that the process of wave induced mixing depends on the wave height and the wavelength the rate of change of the temperature distribution is more pronounced for high waves and increases with increasing water depth the complexity of mixing effects induced by deep water waves arises from high velocity gradients in the upper layer of the water column the significant effect of the wavelength and in consequence the frequency structure of a particular wave field on wave induced mixing conform a need to include spectral analysis in the study of mixing effects the theoretical model was verified based on measurements conducted in a series of original laboratory experiments a reasonable agreement between theoretical results and experimental data is observed it is interesting to note that the model is applicable even to cases of relatively high vertical gradients in temperature distributions the present studies indicate that the problem of heat losses through the boundaries of the intentionally closed system is significant and requires special attention heat losses and wave flume side effects should be taken into account at the planning and design stages of future experiments on wave induced vertical mixing 
22311,a theoretical approach is applied to investigate wave induced mixing the problem is formulated to describe evolution of temperature in a layer of fluid and is solved by applying eigenfunction expansions the derived semi analytical solution is applied to predict temperature changes and evolution of temperature profiles due to mechanically generated waves in a closed flume the results show that water waves modify the temperature distribution in space and time the analysis shows that the changes occur in the whole layer of fluid the results indicate that time is a more important factor in a process of wave induced mixing than expected mixing processes depend on a wave height the rate of change of temperature distribution is more pronounced for higher waves another important parameter in mixing processes is the wavelength the mixing effects are more distinct for deep water waves the sensitivity analysis implies a need to conduct more theoretical studies and experimental investigations on wave induced mixing the model is verified in the course of the original laboratory experiments that were conducted in the insulated flume a reasonable agreement between predicted and

parameterized wave induced mixing in ocean circulation models confirm its importance in climate predictions and imply a necessity to study mixing induced by nonbraking waves qiao et al 2004 xia et al 2006 song et al 2007 the role of waves in vertical mixing may be evaluated by conducting laboratory experiments in a wave flume babanin and haus 2009 dai et al 2010 sulisz and paprota 2015 laboratory experiments have been shown to be useful in the studies of many wave induced processes experiments in a wave flume are the source of basic information on wave induced processes and are essential in the analysis of the physics of wave induced mixing phenomenon moreover laboratory experiments allow to separate the mixing originated from breaking and non breaking processes this is of fundamental importance for calibration of wave induced mixing models the experiments conducted for nonlinear waves provide insight into the physics of wave induced mixing the recorded changes of temperature profiles are realistic and resemble vertical distributions of temperature recorded in the upper ocean however data obtained in laboratory experiments are contaminated by undesirable side effects a preliminary analysis of data collected by dai et al 2010 indicate that in some cases side effects may be significant despite the progress made in arranging and conducting laboratory experiments to get insight and knowledge on wave induced mixing processes including various novel techniques experimental data collected in a wave flume have numerous limitations and drawbacks and often may not be applied to explain many phenomena observed in field campaigns and in situ measurements there is evidently a need to develop advanced theoretical models describing wave generation propagation and wave induced mixing effects to further study the features of wave induced mixing processes an attractive alternative to available approaches is to apply a semi analytical solution that satisfies a boundary value problem of the considered physical process and to satisfy the remaining boundary conditions by a proper selection of the coefficients of the proposed solution or by applying more complex techniques sulisz and paprota 2004 2008 in this work theoretical studies are conducted to investigate wave induced mixing first the theoretical approach to the two dimensional problem of wave driven evolution of water temperature structure in a closed flume is developed then the derived numerical model is applied to provide insight into a potential origin of wave induced mixing the theoretical results are compared with experimental data obtained from original laboratory experiments conducted in the wave flume finally theoretical and experimental data are analyzed with emphasis on factors and wave parameters affecting mixing processes and the conclusions are specified 2 theory 2 1 particle kinematics the problem of generation and propagation of nonlinear water waves in a wave flume and the effects of generated waves on wave induced mixing is considered a right hand cartesian coordinate system is selected such that the x axis is horizontal and coincides with the undisturbed free surface and z points vertically upwards fig 1 it is assumed that the motion of the inviscid and incompressible fluid is irrotational the horizontal flume bottom and vertical wavemaker paddle are impervious according to the assumptions the velocity vector v x z t has a potential φ x z t such that v φ the fluid motion is governed by the laplace equation 1a 2 φ 0 and the bernoulli equation 1b φ t 1 ρ p g z 1 2 φ 2 0 where ρ is the fluid density p is the pressure g is the acceleration due to gravity the velocity potential φ x z t satisfies the laplace equation 2a 2 φ 0 at the free surface the velocity potential φ x z t has to satisfy the kinematic boundary condition 2b η t φ x η x φ z 0 z η x t and the dynamic boundary condition 2c φ t g η 1 2 φ x 2 φ z 2 0 z η x t at the wavemaker the velocity potential φ x z t has to satisfy the kinematic boundary condition 2d χ t φ z χ z φ x 0 x χ z t at the sea bottom the following boundary condition must be satisfied 2e φ z 0 z h moreover the velocity potential must satisfy boundary conditions at infinity and initial conditions wehausen 1960 it is not a trivial task to solve the boundary value problem 2 this is because the boundary conditions at the free surface and at the wavemaker contain nonlinear terms moreover the boundary conditions must be applied on the free surface which is unknown and is a part of a final solution wehausen 1960 the kinematic free surface boundary condition the dynamic free surface boundary condition and the kinematic wavemaker boundary condition are often expanded in a taylor series about a mean position 3a n 0 η n n n z n η t φ x η x φ z 0 z 0 3b n 0 η n n n z n φ t g η 1 2 φ x 2 φ z 2 0 z 0 3c n 0 χ n n n x n χ t φ z χ z φ x 0 x 0 which usually helps to obtain a solution dean and dalrymple 1984 hudspeth and sulisz 1991 the boundary value problem 2 may be written in the following form 4a 2 φ 0 4b η t φ x η x φ z η 2 φ x z η x η 2 φ z 2 1 2 η 2 3 φ z 3 0 z 0 4c φ t g η 1 2 φ x 2

must satisfy boundary conditions at infinity and initial conditions wehausen 1960 kinsman 1965 the boundary value problem 4 can be solved by applying numerical techniques in some cases the solution of 4 can also be achieved analytically sulisz and hudspeth 1993 the solution procedure is complicated because of a need to satisfy the kinematic wavemaker boundary condition the form of the solution is very complex and is not provided here simplifications are possible only far away from the wavemaker where the time dependent part of the solution takes the following form which is well recognized from wave theories 5a φ x z t a 1 g ω cosh k 1 z h cosh k 1 h sin k 1 x ω t 3 8 ω a 1 2 cosh 2 k 1 z h sinh 4 k 1 h sin 2 k 1 x ω t a 2 g 2 ω cosh k 2 z h cosh k 2 h sin k 2 x 2 ω t η x t a 1 cos k 1 x ω t

k 2 are the wave numbers ω is the frequency 2 2 wave induced mixing in order to describe the wave induced mixing process and predict changes of temperature distribution in space and time a boundary value problem for an advection diffusion equation is formulated it is assumed that the changes of temperature distribution in space and time are only due to wave induced velocities and diffusion processes which are governed by the following advection diffusion equation 6 t t u t x w t z x κ t x z κ t z where t denotes the water temperature t is the time u and w are the wave induced horizontal and vertical velocity components κ is the diffusion coefficient a theoretical analysis indicates that the diffusion coefficient may be represented as a sum of the molecular and wave induced diffusivities 7a κ κ m κ v where κ m 1 4 10 7 m2 s is the background molecular diffusivity and κ v represents the wave induced diffusivity derived by sulisz and paprota 2015 as 7b κ v α a 1 3 k 1 ω sinh 2 k 1 z h cosh k 1 z h sinh 3 k 1 h where α is the dimensionless coefficient which should be determined by observations or numerical experiments the expression derived for the wave induced diffusivity allows water waves to be incorporated in a mixing process in a simplified manner as a consequence the temperature in the water column and its time evolving profiles depend on wave parameters the initial boundary value problem for t x z t may be written as follows 8a t t u t x w t z x κ t x z κ t z at the free water surface the temperature t x z t must satisfy the following condition 8b ν t t z 0 z 0 at the wavemaker the horizontal gradient of t x z t must vanish 8c t x 0 x 0 at the bottom boundary the following condition must be satisfied 8d t z 0 z h far away from disturbance the horizontal changes in temperature may be neglected 8e t x 0 x provided that 8f t z t 0 z t 0 where t 0 z is assumed to be the known temperature distribution in the water column at t 0 the condition 8b accounts for partial radiation at the oscillating free surface which is observed in physical experiments this type of conditions are widely applied in the modeling of many physical phenomena in general ν may be a complex value quantity which often facilitates the modeling process the solution of 8 is achieved by a time stepping procedure consisting of an application of an eigenfunction expansion method to describe t and the adams bashford moulton predictor corrector or runge kutta formulas to proceed in time press et al 1988 this method has been shown to be an efficient technique in the modeling of the propagation and transformation of nonlinear water waves sulisz and paprota 2004 2011 2013 accordingly the solution takes the following form 9a t 1 x z t m 1 n 1 a m n t cos λ m 0 x b cos λ 0 n z h provided that the eigenvalues satisfy 9b ν 1 λ m 0 tan λ m 0 b 0 ν 3 λ 0 n tan λ 0 n h 0 the coefficients of the eigenfunction expansions are determined by applying the fourier method canuto et al 1988 the application of the eigenfunction expansions and the fourier method makes the solution procedure very efficient and enables to obtain results even for large spatial or time domains the form of 9 allows the radiation to be incorporated at the boundary of the fluid domain in order to simplify the approach and speed up calculations radiation was omitted in the analysis of theoretical results the initial boundary value problem 8 is solved by applying the following numerical procedure first the wave induced diffusivity and velocities are determined using eq 7b and by applying the method reported in hudspeth and sulisz 1991 respectively for given selected wave parameters then the time stepping scheme is employed to advance the solution in time starting from the initial condition 8f in the present study the classical fourth order runge kutta method is applied eq 8a is used to determine the values of time derivative of temperature t in order to calculate spatial derivatives of t appearing in eq 8 the eigenfunction expansion 9a with eigenvalues 9b is used the unknown coefficients a mn are determined by applying a two dimensional cosine fast fourier transform 2 3 theoretical results the numerical model derived to describe wave induced mixing processes and predict changes of temperature distribution in space and time is applied to study the changes of temperature distribution in a semi infinite layer of the fluid triggered by water waves the main attention is paid to the effect of a return current on mixing phenomenon the calculations are conducted for the basic parameters of the model including time wave heights wave lengths etc typical temperature distribution in a layer of fluid arising from wave induced mixing is presented in fig 2 the plot shows the temperature distribution in the sector of a channel of length 3h for the amplitude of the incident wave a 1 h 0 05 the results indicate that the initial temperature distribution is altered by waves the initial values of temperature t z used in all numerical tests are provided in table 1 the influence of waves may be deduced from the changes of temperate profiles along the channel the main changes occur in the sector close to the wavemaker paddle in fact changes of temperate distribution occur in the whole layer of fluid however for a relatively short period of time considered here most distinguished changes occur in a sector close to the wavemaker in the area affected by the wavemaker the wave field is very complex due to the wave radiation formation of evanescent modes and mode attenuation the complexity of wave induced mixing effects indicates that the temperature field in a sector affected by the wavemaker should be analyzed individually in each case to illustrate the process of vertical mixing induced by surface waves a number of additional numerical tests is performed and presented in following graphs in fig 3 a spatial distribution of water temperature for wave conditions corresponding to the depth parameter kh 0 5 1 1 5 and 2 and the depth relative amplitude a 1 h 0 025 0 05 and 0 1 are presented after 100 s of propagation of mechanically generated waves in the flume it can be seen from the graphs presented in fig 3 that the effect of wavelength and amplitude is apparent for lower values of amplitude and lower depths the mixing process is slower the highest intensity of wave induced mixing is visible for kh 2 and a 1 h 0 1 a more detailed description of the effect of wave amplitude and wavelength is provided below together with the graphical representation the effect of time on the temperature distribution in the considered layer of fluid is shown in fig 4 the plots clearly indicate the changes of temperature distribution arising from wave induced mixing the changes are most pronounced in the first sector of the channel the analysis shows that the main changes in this sector are due to the action of a return flow however changes of temperate distribution occur in the whole layer of fluid the plots indicate that time is a more important factor in the process of wave induced mixing than expected the effects of wave height on the changes of temperature distribution in the considered sector of the fluid are depicted in fig 5 the effect of a wave height on wave induced mixing is evident the process of wave induced mixing depends on a wave height and the results indicate that the rate of change of the temperature distribution grows with increasing the wave height the analysis indicates that the wave height is an important factor in the process of wave induced mixing the next important wave parameter affecting the temperature distribution is the wavelength fig 6 the results indicate that the changes of temperature distribution are complex and are becoming more pronounced for deep water waves the analysis shows that the complexity of wave induced mixing effects arise from high velocity gradients in the deep water upper layer the significant effect of wavelength and in consequence a frequency structure of a particular wave field on wave induced mixing conform a need to include spectral analysis in the study of mixing effects in figs 7 and 8 the dependences of the normalised spatially averaged temperature as a function of depth parameter kh and depth relative amplitude a h over the rectangular fluid domain extending from water surface down to the bottom and from the wavemaker to the vertical boundary located 3 depths from the wavemaker are presented it can be seen that the average temperature changes intensity in the vicinity of the wavemaker paddle grows as the wavelength decreases kh increases fig 7 the growth of intensity of changes is linear in this case in turn the rate of change of temperature grows with increasing wave amplitude in a non linear fashion 3 laboratory experiments 3 1 wave flume setup the verification of the presented approach was performed in the wave flume owned by the institute of hydro engineering polish academy of sciences gdańsk the flume is equipped with a programmable piston type wavemaker driven by an ac motor connected to the electric control system preliminary stage of the laboratory activities was devoted to the design of the insulated section of the flume in the separated part of width b 0 3 m that is shown schematically in fig 9 during the experiments the water depth was h 0 4 m an array of electrical heaters was immersed into water to heat up the upper layer of the fluid after the system of heaters was removed the flume was covered by insulation plates in order to maintain an initial steady thermal state of the system characterised by the vertical temperature profile t 0 z insulation was also used to reduce heat losses due to radiation during the tests the temperature gauge constituted a sensor installed on a vertical measuring rod the distance from the gauge to the wavemaker paddle was x 9 2 m the focus of experimental investigations was put on the effect of surface waves on the vertical mixing process after the system of electrical heaters was lifted and removed the temperature profile over depth was measured the measurements were conducted every 0 01 m then a train of regular waves of fixed wave height h 0 04 m and wavelength l 0 8 m was generated for 120 s when the waves and internal waves decayed the temperature profile over depth was measured again to provide information on the effect of surface waves on vertical mixing process the resulting time interval between two successive temperature profile registrations was 3600 s 3 2 experimental results the results of laboratory experiments are presented in fig 10 the graphs show the measured temperature profiles of the initial temperature distribution and the final distribution over the depth the comparisons between theoretical results and experimental data for the final temperature distribution are also presented in fig 10 the validation of the theoretical model was performed for α 0 002 that was assessed based on the results of previous studies sulisz and paprota 2015 according to the following procedure first the initial measured temperature profile was used as an initial condition of the boundary value problem 8 then for 120 s the profile was modified by waves taking into account the diffusivity described by equation 7 simultaneously the temperature structure was evolving due to the wave induced advection governed by the advective terms of equation 6 after 120 s the waves vanished and the temperature structure of the system was modified by the molecular diffusion it should be noted that although the efforts were made in order to separate the measuring section by insulation plates some radiation of heat was observed during the experiment the derived model accounts for the partial radiation at the water surface by the application of the boundary condition 8b in the fig 10 theoretical values are provided both for adiabatic and non adiabatic conditions it can be seen that incorporating radiation into the boundary value problem 8 improves the accuracy of the theoretical results in the upper part of the water column as a matter of fact the heat radiation may also be significant at the wave flume walls and the wavemaker paddle the construction of the radiation free measuring section in the wave flume is a challengeable task it is difficult to evaluate the intensity of these processes without further comprehensive experimental studies on wave induced vertical mixing processes supported by reliable theoretical models 4 summary a theoretical approach is applied to study wave induced vertical mixing an initial boundary value problem was formulated to describe the evolution of temperature in a layer of fluid under propagating water waves and was solved by applying eigenfunction expansions and a time stepping procedure the derived semi analytical solution

22312,various factors influence the design of subsea pipeline subjected to high temperature and pressure operating loads cycles of operating shut down and start up have been shown to cause pipeline axial movement which is called walking walking can influence pipeline performance and cause lateral deflection amplitudes at buckled zones as a result of walking and lateral buckling interaction a novel cost effective method for walking mitigation is investigated in this paper using of fe modeling to simulate the novel way of eliminating the occurrence of walking the proposed technique for mitigating pipeline walking involves creating initial local lateral deformations along the pipeline via imposed local curvature during pipeline reel laying the interaction between walking and lateral buckling is also explored for an example pipeline with initial local deformations imposed at regular small intervals along the pipeline the effects of the residual curvatures on pipeline response to temperature and pressure loading are considered in this paper the reduction in walking rate of subsea pipelines with different numbers of initial deformations is considered furthermore a continuous snake lay form of deformations is proposed as a very effective method for controlling walking and attaining virtually a zero value of incremental walking per cycle keywords subsea pipelines walking lateral buckling reel laying continuous snake lay abbreviations eaf effective axial force fe finite element imp imperfections jip joint industry project kp kilometre point vap virtual anchor point ht high temperature hp high pressure psi pipe soil interaction δ walking per cycle 1 introduction a primary function of a subsea flowline may be to transport hot gas from a well head to a designed destination axial expansions of the pipe due to gas transportation generally take place via different operating fluid pressures and temperatures at either end of the pipe as a result flowline safe operation in high temperature and pressure conditions is an industry challenge because of such operating loads on the pipeline and expansions along the pipe length as a natural tendency of steel pipe friction forces between a pipeline and the seabed act to resist this axial movement and when the axial driving force exceeds the soil resistance force pipeline axial displacement occurs several cycles of shut down and start up may occur through the design life of an offshore field that can vary the pipe loading state cyclic variation of pipe temperature may lead to global axial displacement which is known as pipeline walking after each shut down and start up event the pipeline moves bodily axially accumulation of the incremental axial movements may occur due to loading by the cyclic heating and cooling during start up product flow from the wellhead causes asymmetry with regard to the mid length of the flowline in temperature profiles throughout the flowline s route consequently one end of the pipe would be warmer than the other end during the pipeline heat up and pipe global movement would take place usually toward the cold end bruton et al 2006 on the other hand cooling usually takes place after shut down and pipe temperature cooling is assumed to reduce virtually uniformly along the length of the pipe from the fully heated temperature to the relevant ambient temperature a pipeline is a flexible uni directional structure that tends to relieve high axial compressive forces through developing lateral deformations lateral buckling in a subsea pipeline and deflected pipe dimensions might lead to failure because of high strains imposed at a pipe s section during cyclic thermal loads da costa et al 2002 axial load reduction at a laterally buckled zone potentially could result in changes in pipeline walking response alternatively pre deformed pipe installed over specific distances can be utilized to mitigate pipeline walking as described in following sections of the paper the behavior of lightweight pipes subjected to cyclic loading and pipe soil interaction effect on pipe response has been studied by bruton et al 2008 it was noted that dividing long pipelines into a series of short pipelines can also result in pipeline walking occurrence accumulative displacements induced by walking during the entire life of the system can be extensive and lead to severe problems for the integrity of the flowline axial walking throughout lifetime in some projects can be more than 30 m bruton et al 2006 as a consequence of this extraordinary movement of subsea pipelines many consequences may arise such as overloading spool pieces or jumpers carr et al 2003 route curve stability of pipeline pipe end expansion and feed in to lateral buckles are other consequences bruton et al 2008 the presence of these consequences emphasizes the need to control and mitigate the extent of the axial movements of a flowline during the design phase pre laying installation of subsea buckle initiating sleepers can be implemented as a mitigation technique for both walking and lateral buckling deformations of deepwater pipelines perinet and simon 2011 different lateral buckling and walking mitigation techniques comprising snake lay sleepers rock dumping and anchors have been evaluated in practical projects based on industry experience these mitigation methods are costly and the approximate required budget for such mitigations could be about 10 of the flowline cost perinet and simon 2011 another methodology to mitigate the pipeline buckling is use of buoyancy sections pipeline performance with distributed buoyancy modulus to mitigate lateral buckling was evaluated by antunes et al 2010 in the pipeline design procedure the effect of buoyancy sections on buckle pattern feed in dimension and virtual anchor spacing must be considered in case of long distance between two designed imperfections locations buckles may occur in any initial out of straightness deformation somewhere between these two unintentional out of straightness may also happen by free span that can trigger the buckling in an unplanned location seyfipour et al 2016 seyfipour and bahaari 2018 a residual curvature method as a cost effective method has been utilized in some projects such as skuld and edradour cooper et al 2017 for controlling lateral buckling performance via created imperfections along the pipe during reel laying operation application of the residual curvature method for mitigating potential high walking rate of short pipelines and interaction between walking and buckling are investigated in the present paper using an example flowline geometry which is described in detail in following sections also the effects of the number of initial deformations on walking rate are evaluated as a controlled walking strategy during pipeline design process furthermore an optimized shape of pipeline route in continuous snake lay pattern is proposed and discussed as providing complete control of a flowline walking condition 2 finite element analysis 2 1 model detail axial walking analysis of a subsea pipeline induced by high temperature and high pressure loading is assessed here fe modeling using abaqus software abaqus analysis user s manual 2014 simulates the walking phenomenon an example flowline with free to move boundary conditions at both ends is modelled by deformable pipe elements over a seabed modelled as a rigid flat horizontal surface the pipeline model uses the pipe31h element type from the abaqus library which is a three dimensional two noded linear pipe element with a hybrid formulation the pipe elements length is 0 5m abaqus analysis user s manual 2014 finite element modeling incorporates all nonlinearities including large deformations and plastic behavior of steel materials the data for the example flowline model are presented in table 1 gravity load is applied at the initial step in the fe analysis pipe soil friction is defined at the initial step and friction force is mobilized after applying the gravity load and then the internal pressure is applied to the pipe 2 2 pipe soil interaction soil axial resistance is quite straightforward however lateral friction can be different based on the pipeline embedment on seabed white and cheuk 2008 seabed friction forces rely on pipe displacement in lateral and axial directions soil resistance force usually reaches the maximum force at very small pipeline lateral deformation values then it reduces to a residual resistance force lateral friction but not axial friction in larger deformations of the pipe soil interface plastic response the soil friction model presented in fig 1 is employed in the fe model to account for pipe movements in axial and lateral directions as used by chee et al 2018 2019 this model and similar models have been used widely by others in recent pipe soil interaction studies axial friction response is defined by a modified elasto plastic interaction model mobilization of maximum axial friction occurs in a very small displacement this frictional mobilization length is assumed to be 5 mm this first part of bi linear model is linear which shows elastic slip at the initial phase of pipe loading for larger displacement values the purely axial friction coefficient is assumed to equal 0 5 resistance to lateral movements for subsea pipelines is not as simple as the model for axial resistance the influence of soil berms through the lateral movement is emphasized in this model the maximum friction coefficient is assumed to occur after 30 mm of lateral movement with brittle breakout as a result of berm formation when lateral breakout resistance reaches the maximum value sliding occurs at a lower resistance value and the friction coefficient varies from 1 to 0 5 depending of the ploughing by the pipe on the seabed surface cyclic pipe soil interaction behavior during lateral displacements is schematically shown in fig 2 at the initial step of the heat up process cycle 1 heat up 1 the pipeline moves lateraly as shown in fig 2 effects of soil hardening and an initial embedment of the pipeline into the seabed soil can be considered in the friction coefficient and the final seabed resistance force the maximum lateral displacement occurs once the temprature reaches to the operational temperature cycle 1 heat up 7 during the cool down stage the pipeline moves in the reverse direction a similar cyclic response is considered for the axial movement without the hardening effect chee et al 2018 the resistance force of seabed soil is defined in the model by appling the friction coefficient on the fe model pipe soil interaction model is defined by using an abaqus subroutine called fric which controls the axial and lateral movements of the pipeline in order to ensure the correctness of the fric subroutine action and its corresponding fe results a verification analysis is carried out and the results are provided in appendix a 2 3 temperature transient profiles after the gravity load and pipe soil interaction temperature variation is added in subsequent steps of the analysis one major factor for the walking phenomena is transient thermal profiles along the line hot fluid flowing from one end of the subsea pipeline which is surrounded by seawater at ambient temperature condition can progressively warm the steel pipe once the hot gas flows through the pipe after the start up state the steel pipe temperature increases asymmetrically relative to mid length of the flowline based on the defined temperature profiles along the pipe length so during the start up process one end of the pipeline is warmer than the other end in diverse forms of gradient profiles during heat up stages the slope of these heat up profiles can meaningfully change the walking rate carr et al 2003 during each well shut down occurrence it is assumed that the pipe loses heat fairly uniformly over the pipe length during the cooling process and the shut down time is long enough to attain seabed ambient conditions along the full length of the pipeline shape of thermal transient profiles can have a significant influence in determining the axial walking rate previous attempts to formulate the walking phenomena have been prepared based on simplified linear form of the shapes of transient profiles carr and sinclair 2006 in the present paper temperature profiles are assumed to be based on a more realistic configuration some sophisticated models are available for heat transfer performance that depends on many different characteristics of pipeline and the fluid properties fluid density fluid specific heat average external temperature fluid temperature fluid flow rate etc are some parameters influencing the temperature profile shape bai and bai 2005 guo et al 2006 in this study the assumed transient temperature profiles along the pipeline for different steps of heat up and cool down conditions are shown graphically in fig 3 a constant ambient temperature 12 c is considered along the pipe at the primary step subsequent heat up and cool down phases with different temperature variation rate between the hot end kp 0 and the cold end kp 4 881 points as shown in fig 3 are defined in the fem start up stages are displayed in seven steps from heat up 1 to heat up 7 and shut down stages are defined in four steps from cool down 1 to cool down 4 these temperature profiles are implemented for all analyses in this paper except the analysis in the appendix section 3 pipeline as laid configurations different patterns of the subsea pipeline on seabed are assessed in the paper comprising a straight pipeline with no deformation and lateraly deformed pipelines 3 1 straight pipeline the maximum walking rate occurs in a pipeline which is laid in a straight condition the walking mechanism of a straight pipeline is analysed first to provide a basis for comparison with walking mitigation techniques in subsequent sections proposed in the present paper thus a straight pipeline with 4881m length is considered to be subjected to cyclic thermal load variations the configuration of the pipeline along the installed pipeline route has a significant influence on the walking response 3 2 residual curvature from reel laying because of the high walking rate of a straight pipeline engineers are required to pursue a solution to eliminate or mitigate it also a high axial compressive force has a significant effect in increasing the susceptibility to uncontrolled lateral buckling of the pipeline on the other hand ensuring controlled buckles along the pipeline is an efficient method to relieve high compressive forces within this strategy predefined lateral deformations called imperfections created at regular intervals along pipelines can be used to reduce the compressive longitudinal force by initiating buckles at specified intervals along the pipe length residual curvature from reel laying operation and pre deformed lateral buckles are proposed in the present paper as a mechanism to reduce axial compressive forces along the pipeline the residual curvatures at regular distances can divide the pipeline into short pipelines between buckles lateral buckling formation depends on the initial imperfection size this imperfection is presented in fig 4 with about 0 2 initial strain as a practical case cooper et al 2017 although the assumed value for initial strain is 0 2 actual strain values may vary between 0 15 and 0 25 residual curvature can be created during the laying operation by the straightener device of a reel lay installation vessel tewolde 2017 residual curvature method as a cost effective solution is described in following sections of this paper as an attractive design method for mitigating walking and uncontrolled lateral deformations i e buckling of un buried pipeline on the seabed a new approach to employ the residual curvature method with the intention of mitigated walking response of short pipelines is assessed in this paper through simulation of fe analyses initial curvature is one of the significant factors which affects structural response an assumed example curvature chee et al 2018 is considered as the initial condition for the as installed shape of the pipeline in order to evaluate structural integrity the combined influences of axial and lateral movements at each cycle of start up and shut down of the pipeline are considered schematic buckle development at imperfection location because of thermal forces is also depicted in fig 4 3 3 continuous snake lay based on a wide range of fe analyses and results that were described in previous sections of the present paper a new configuration of pipeline geometry on seabed is further considered as a means to mitigate the walking phenomenon the continuous snake lay shape is developed to potentially minimise the walking rate of ht hp pipelines a schematic drawing of the pipeline configuration is depicted in fig 5 in this method pipeline route is defined in zigzag form instead of the straight shape ten crowns i e location of maximum lateral deformation are defined along the pipe with radii equal to 0 12l where l represents total length of the pipeline the amplitude of each crown and each lobe length are assumed l 100 and l 10 respectively 4 results 4 1 walking of a straight pipeline during the design procedure engineers focus on effective axial force eaf profiles which are reliant on temperature pressure pipeline submerged weight and seabed friction force dnv 2010 pipeline response as a short pipeline and possibility of walking phenomena are illustrated in eaf profiles in fig 6 compressive and tensile effective forces during the first cycle of startup and shut down are presented in that figure the response of the straight pipeline shows how the maximum effective axial force can occur in a virtual anchor position vap at the flowline mid length the maximum axial load will be induced when the axial friction is mobilized throughout the pipe length the flowline is not constrained and is free to expand at both ends where the axial effective force is zero internal pressure is applied to the pipe in the initial step of the first cycle and causes an axial compressive effective force following this very small applied temperature is required to reach a fully mobilized psi condition the compressive axial force is highest at the inlet end of the pipe during warm up steps prior to the fully heat up condition first cycle heat up 1 to heat up 6 the tensile axial force in the flowline during cool down is almost symmetric because of the assumed virtually uniform cool down temperature profiles when the pipeline is re heated during the second start up cycle the distribution of effective axial load in heat up steps will differ from the first cycle because of residual tension in the pipeline from the first cycle effective axial force profiles for subsequent cycles after the initial one are shown in fig 7 pipeline incremental movements toward the cold end and resultant tension forces can change the longitudinal force distribution during the heat up steps the effective axial force diagram governs the walking behavior and probability of lateral buckling unsymmetrical axial force distribution during heat up steps causes non uniform expansion which leads to axial walking assumed more or less uniform cool down profiles cause almost symmetrical unloading profiles during the shut down stages the eaf profile in each step is induced by the applied temperature profile in that particular stage for example cycle2 heat up 2 and cycle2 cool down 1 profiles in fig 7 represent temperature transient profiles heat up 2 and cool down 1 in fig 3 respectively accordingly changing shape and slope of temperature transient profiles can amend the eaf and consequently change the walking rate cumulative axial movements at the flowline mid length section and at both ends of the pipe toward the cold end are illustrated in fig 8 incremental movements per cycle for these three points of the straight flowline are presented in fig 9 the incremental walking movement per cycle is constant 272 3 mm after the second cycle considering 50 cycles of start up and shut down during the service lifetime of the line the cumulative displacement towards the cold end would be about 13 3 m that has to be prevented or accommodated in the pipeline design the axial movement of the mid length section of the pipeline determines walking incremental walking at the first step is insignificant because of the internal pressure effect on the axial load which is uniformly applied along the pipeline and only a very small temperature is required to create the fully mobilized situation in contrast with the first cycle the compressive axial loads in subsequent cycles are not symmetric as previously shown in fig 7 which causes asymmetric expansion and a higher rate of incremental axial movement also it is observed that the incremental walking rate which is the non recoverable portion of axial movement for different points along the straight pipe are equal after the second cycle of temperature variation cumulative walking for the entire length of the straight pipeline is illustrated in fig 10 the maximum expansion in each cycle occurs at the highest temperature condition heat up 7 and residual axial displacement after each cycle is presented in cool down 4 curves a different range of expansion is observed throughout the pipe length during each cycle the two free ends of the pipeline experience the maximum range of cyclic displacement whereas permanent walking per cycle is constant along the pipe after the second cycle for instance axial displacement difference between cycle 10 cool down 4 and cycle 9 cool down 4 is constant over the pipe length which shows the overall movement of the pipeline toward the cold end the maximum walking rate of walking is investigated through the analysis of an example of a straight pipeline with no lateral imperfections considered as a basis for comparison with more complex novel analysis results the effective axial force profiles for the straight pipeline show that the maximum effective force relates in a so called short pipeline with no lateral deformation a significant walking response of the mid line section of the pipeline was generated due to assumed temperature gradient profiles the calculated axial movement for a specified number of operation cycles was 0 27m 4 2 three applications of residual curvatures along the pipe in this section the same straight pipeline exemplified in section 4 1 with three sections of imposed lateral deformations along the pipeline is studied the initial deformations are assumed to be generated during the reel laying and may trigger additional lateral movements i e lateral buckling at these three locations all initial out of straightness is created at the same distance with identical shape as illustrated in fig 4 subsequently the longitudinal force due to applied operating temperature and pressure will decrease noticeably at the buckled positions compressive and tensile effective axial force distributions along the total length of the pipeline during the initial cycle are shown in fig 11 by utilizing three equally spaced imposed deformations pipeline is virtually divided into four sections the maximum axial forces are generated at four virtual anchor points along the pipeline because of the reduction of the effective axial force at buckle locations pipeline length is a key parameter in pipeline buckling bruton 2005 so by dividing the pipeline in these four segments by imposing three separate buckles in between buckling rate can be different from the straight pipeline the variations of effective axial forces along the pipe during the second cycle of start up and shut down are shown in fig 12 it is seen that the maximum absolute value of compressive axial load decreases at each cycle in contrast to the maximum tensile load which increases at subsequent cycles of start up and shut down this variation in the maximum value of longitudinal force in subsequent cycles is due to the residual tensile forces caused by pipeline axial movements in each cycle regarding the four sections between vaps and pipeline ends the axial load distribution history during heat up is different for one section to another this variation in the axial forces causes different walking rates for the four sections different axial forces at three buckle locations may also result in different buckle behaviors as in the present case the buckle shape and maximum lateral deflection can be different at these three sections the pipeline axial movements during the initial start up and shut down are shown in fig 13 due to the increasing temperature during the first heat up the pipeline expands separately at each section at the middle step of heat up i e cycle 1 heat up 3 the expansion rate for the hotter sections of the buckled pipe i e the left side section is higher than the cold side sections this variation in the different rate of expansion shows the effect of defined heat up transient temperature profile for each section the full heat up step i e cycle 1 heat up 7 represents the peak axial movement in the first cycle pipeline uniform cool down is shown by the cycle 1 cool down 2 curve the full shut down situation cycle 1 cool down 4 demonstrates incremental axial movement along the pipeline as result of the loading history and seabed friction the general expansion behavior of each section is displayed in fig 13 and this behavior shows how the pipeline moves towards the cold end in each section it can be seen that expansion occurs at both side of each virtual anchored point during the cool down process the pipeline tends to return to its previous position however the seafloor friction force restricts the pipe contraction a significant expansion is observed at the full heat up state maximum operating condition and the maximum axial expansions at both ends of the pipeline are presented in fig 13 which can be a challenge for pipeline design fig 14 shows the cumulative pipeline axial movement at full shut down condition ambient temperature during 10 cycles of loading the cumulative longitudinal displacement after each cycle represents the pipeline walking behavior pipeline buckling and walking together lead to different amounts of walking in four sections along the pipeline the schematic graph of lateral deformation is depicted in fig 14 the dissimilar rate of walking at both ends of each buckle leads to asymmetric buckle configuration pipe expansion is different in each section thus the feed in lengths of lateral buckles will be different the dashed line in fig 14 presents the pipeline expansion under pressure load at the initial step of analysis subsequent loading procedures for cyclic change in temperature induces various ranges of axial walking from hot end to cold end of the pipeline during the cool down pipeline movement will reduce close to the virtual anchor positions however axial friction forces prevent it from returning to the initial positions as shown in the present example this residual axial displacement after four cycles of heating and cooling is presented by cycle4 cool down 4 profile subsequent cycles represent the tendency of the pipeline to move bodily toward the cold end ve axial displacement pipe axial movements in separate sections may be considered as a chain of independently moving pipe sections dissimilar walking associated with lateral buckling causes different buckle configurations and dimensions progressive deformation of the pipeline caused by increasing numbers of loading cycles over the system lifetime might result in serious practical consequences a walking mitigation method for such a system may have different results in each pipeline section because of altered axial movements non uniform transient temperature profiles cause various buckle site to be initiated during first heat up and different ranges of walking rate at each section lead to asymmetric buckle shapes during subsequent cycles axial strains along the pipe are affected by temperature pressure and bending moment variations an additional axial strain variation history during one start up cycle is presented in fig 15 these values show only additional axial strain during the heat up and the total axial strain can be calculated by adding the initial strain assumed to be 0 2 to the additional strain also the total strain can be calculated by considering the hoop strain effect the maximum axial strain will occur in buckled zones because of the relatively extreme curvatures at these pipe sections between the three buckles the middle one will reach the peak value of longitudinal strain because of its longer feed in length the reduction of the axial strain occurs at the four virtual anchor points that indicate the influence of soil friction on the pipe s strain because of seabed restriction on the pipe expansion at feed in lengths because of high axial load and pipeline deformations at the buckled zone a large level of axial strain will occur at the crown of a buckle along a pipeline with 3 imperfection sections the maximum axial strain occurs at the full heat up condition maximum operating condition of the first cycle which is 0 58 for the model with three imperfections i e 0 2 initial strain plus 0 38 additional axial strain the interaction between buckling and walking is a crucial phenomenon which may have serious consequences for pipeline integrity and it can build up into un symmetric buckle forms the check for the maximum strain level located at the crown of the middle imperfection is a key parameter for the system safety check also the reduction of the effective axial force and lateral buckling can create an extreme strain along the pipeline the lateral deflections of the middle buckle in the pipeline operational phase for ten cycles of start up and shut down are shown in fig 16 for the displacement in comparison to the initial position of pipeline it may be seen how walking can feed into the buckle and enlarge the buckled shape and the development of lateral deformation at a buckled section during start up and shut down cycles the reason for this cyclic growth in lateral deflection is the walking effect that can increase the initial deflection at each cycle the general buckle mode shape also varies at each cycle and this transformation will be determined by the initial imperfection at first cycle and the buckle positions along the pipeline and the transient temperature profiles the cyclic buckle development shows that the walking phenomenon can be a severe problem when it interacts with buckling these different buckle shapes after each cycle represent possible changes in other structural parameters the graph in fig 16 is presented for the specific situation as described during the fem presentation and any change in model such as a different friction coefficient may lead into a different lateral deflection nonetheless the growth of lateral deflection after each cycle shows how it can absorb the energy via lateral movement pipe bending and change in the axial movement along the pipe walking contributes to feed in to pipeline buckled sections and as a result increase of lateral deformations are observed after each cycle such deformations might lead to failure during the pipeline design lifecycles as an example of this factor the maximum lateral deflection for three imperfection model is calculated to be 4 34m for the first cycle and 6m for the tenth cycle which shows about 28 buckle size growth because of the walking effect the axial force variation history at the mid line section during 10 cycles of start up and shut down is illustrated in fig 17 applying internal pressure on pipeline with pre deformed imperfections leads to generation of compressive axial loading in the initial step the maximum compressive load at a pipe section will occur during the first start up at critical buckling temperature the critical buckling state is dependent on the initial strain which is considered about 0 2 as a result from the residual curvature during laying operation previously shown in fig 4 compressive axial load will decrease after establishment of the buckling state first shut down leads to generation of tensile loading in the pipeline section because of reduction in lateral deflection and seabed restriction to this movement the similar loading history occurs for following cycles of temperature variation between ambient temperatures 12 c to the maximum temperature at mid line section pipeline walking generates a permanent tensile load at each cycle so the maximum axial tensile load increases with each shut down residual tension after each cycle can be one of the major concerns for some projects because of overloading spool pieces and jumpers carr et al 2003 effective axial force as a function of temperature governs the buckle development severity of lateral buckling must be controlled which can be altered during temperature fluctuations when first the pipeline is exposed to internal pressure and temperature the compressive axial along the pipeline will be the highest value through whole operating life after each loading and unloading the pipeline shape cannot recover the previous configuration and consequently walking will build up additional tension along the pipeline the lower range of axial compressive force in subsequent cycles builds into a variable structural response additional tension after each cycle can also impact on the maximum strain value generated strain at the crown of each buckle decreases in subsequent cycles and the maximum strain value occurs during the first heat up fig 15 because of the residual tension cumulative walking comparison between two models including straight pipeline and three imperfections cases are illustrated in fig 18 and incremental walk per cycle results are presented in fig 19 results from the straight pipeline condition are presented in continuous curve for the virtual anchor point at the mid line location which is 0 27 m cycle after 10 cycles of start up and shut down the predicted level of through life axial movements for this pipeline without imperfection is high and requires to be modified to accommodate this level of axial walking movement four dashed curves represent different ranges of walk rate for each of the virtual anchor points generated in the three imperfections model it is observed that employing these three intended imperfection results in about 88 reduction in walking of the whole pipeline towards its cold end using these three imperfections can significantly reduce the pipeline walking rate 4 3 walking rate reduction in order to determine the pipeline walking and buckling interaction mechanism a series of finite element models are developed in abaqus software these models are created based on different number of imperfections along the pipe using the same imperfection configuration as shown in fig 4 the trajectory of permanent walking per cycle for each virtual anchor point along the pipe is reported in fig 20 for example for the case with 3 initial lateral deformations 4 vaps occur between buckles and free ends walking per cycle for these four points after 10 cycles are presented in this figure a similar method is applied for other cases and walking results are presented in fig 20 the highlighted section shows the reduction trend of walking rate by increasing number of lateral crowns all points illustrated are measured data on each case and two dashed lines represent maximum and minimum values for each case 4 4 continuous snake lay the eaf along the pipe during the first cycle of startup and shut down is displayed in fig 21 the pipeline is virtually divided into nine sections between eight buckles that occur throughout the pipe the effective axial force during subsequent cycles is presented in fig 22 the maximum value of eaf is about 0 41 mn for the model prepared in the continuous snake lay shape which is much lower than the eaf 1 7 mn in the straight pipeline figs 6 and 7 this reduction in the cyclic axial force during the pipline system s lifetime can significantly change the pipeline response the difference between the maximum value of tensile and compressive eaf can noticeably influence the walking rate which is much smaller in the continuous snake lay method in comparison to the straight pipeline because of the low eaf at both ends of the pipe no buckle occurs at the first and last crown locations axial displacements along the continuous snake laid pipeline during the initial cycle of startup and shut down are presented in fig 23 because of temperature profiles fig 3 applied to the model expansion is primarily mobilized at the hot end the maximum expansion occurred at two ends of the pipe which can be easily absorbed by spool pieces the continuous snake laid pipe is free to sweep sideways and through this lateral movement it can absorb much of the energy induced by thermal force thus axial expansion is significantly lower than the corresponding straight pipeline case the cumulative axial movement at the mid line location from the fem results during ten cycles of temperature cycling along the pipeline is shown in fig 24 for both straight pipeline and continuous snake lay models results provide a comparison is presented in fig 24 for cumulative axial movement the calculated axial displacement at the mid point of the straight pipeline is 2 45m after 10 cycles in contrast virtually no axial movement occurs in the continuous snake lay option a different scaled graph of axial movement of continuous lay case is also provided in fig 24 in order to illustrate cyclic movement of the mid point during temperature variation which is about 0 13m axial expansion during the heat up is completely recoverable in shut down phase consequently no walking is detected for this model corresponding incremental walking per cycle results are presented in fig 25 which shows 0 27 m walking movement per cycle for the straight pipe whereas virtually zero incremental walking movement per cycle is calculated for the continuous snake lay case showing an entirely controlled walking phenomenon in a feasible laying method lateral displacement in the continuous snake lay from the initial route position is illustrated in fig 26 a graphic view with altered scale is also presented to provide a zoom in view at kp2 2 location information is provided for 10 cycles of temperature variation at full heat up condition heat up 7 the maximum lateral deflection for the continuous snake lay condition is calculated to be equal to 3 3m with a negligible growth in subsequent cycles the distance between the pipe s section at each crown location to the virtual straight route is 48 81m l 100 in fig 5 at the initial phase which changes to 52 1 m at the maximum operating condition furthermore there is virtually no walking to feed into the buckle during subsequent cycles the axial strain development during the initial heat up is shown in fig 27 for the calculated structural integrity of the continuous snake laid pipeline it is seen the initial strain at the crown locations is 0 03 and the additional strain during warm up is illustrated the peak axial strain occurs at operation phase heat up 7 as a result the lower compressive eaf in continuous snake lay has a generated strains lower than the model with three pre deformed sections fig 15 moreover because of smaller deflection at the buckle locations less significant bending strain is generated at buckle positions in consideration of 2 28 times higher strain in the pipeline with three imperfections noticeable superior structural response observed in the continuous snake lay option 5 conclusion a wide range of finite element analyses have been performed and reported here to investigate the walking rate of subsea pipelines and what measures can be taken to slow or eliminate the rate initial work is carried out on an example straight pipeline to demonstrate the mechanisms and levels of axial walking for example ranges of temperature and pressure the objective of that work is to provide a basis on which to assess the effects of introducing initial out of straightness along the example pipeline the out of straightness is considered to be a possible cost effective force mitigation method introduced to result in reduction of the walking rate interaction of walking and lateral buckling is explored for various conditions of an initial geometry of the example pipeline and the walking rate reduction trend is related to the number of buckles along the pipe finally a continuous snake lay method with significant potential to control walking is proposed and subjected to finite element modeling the main conclusions are summarized as follow an efficient practical method for mitigating the walking rate through creation of initial deformations during pipeline installation has been investigated the effect of initial out of straightness caused by residual curvatures imposed during reel laying operation is investigated through a series of analyses of lateral buckling and walking behavior the finite element model with three pre deformed out of straightness imperfections along the pipe shows that the initially straight pipe is effectively divided into four shorter pipelines by introducing the pre deformations in the deformed sections the effective operating axial force is reduced by 70 because of the reduced distance between virtual cold and hot buckle limits and dividing the pipeline into shorter segments different loading conditions in each subdivision section of the finite element model with three pre deformed sections lead to various walking rates in each section which are considerably lower than is calculated for the initially straight pipeline the average walking rate for this case is approximately 88 lower than the initially straight pipe i e 0 12 x 0 27m 0 032m the walking rate reduction is considered to depend on the number of buckles initiated along the pipeline and has been explored in the present paper one buckle along the pipeline decreases the walking by about 75 when compared to the corresponding straight pipe with no buckles the corresponding reduction ratio for ten buckles case is about 98 which shows a very effective basis for minimizing the effects of axial walking the continuous snake lay method for including regular lateral deformations along an originally straight pipeline is proposed this is concluded to provide an effective method for ensuring controlled levels of walking without requiring any further walking mitigation action fe modeling of an example continuous snake laid pipeline shows about 76 reduction of imposed eaf in comparison to the straight pipe option for the same maximum operating conditions the finite element modeling of cyclic loading of the pipeline with many initially imposed lateral deformations shows that the walking movement of the pipeline is negligible compared to the original walking of the straight pipeline the maximum axial expansion in an example straight pipeline is about 4 68 times larger than the continuous snake lay model furthermore small axial expansion in the continuous snake lay model during heat up is completely recovered through the shut down phase consequently virtually no walking is observed in this system the maximum lateral deformation in continuous snake lay model is 3 3m with eight buckle sites however 4 34m deflection is detected in the first start up of the pipeline with three imperfections there is a noteworthy buckle growth during subsequent cycles in the model with three imperfections but a trivial growth is observed in subsequent cycles for the continuous snake laid pipe an appropriate structural integrity response is measured for the continuous snake lay model the maximum axial strain in the pipeline with three imperfections is 0 58 and it is 0 25 in the continuous snake lay which shows important lower strain and increased safety at the pipeline initially deformed sections appendix a fem verification the appendix is provided to verify the fem used in the paper and compare it with an analytical solution in the literature analytical study of subsea pipeline walking proposed in safebuck project carr and sinclair 2006 was generated based on an assumption of linear transient temperature profiles as presented in the safebuck project walking of the pipeline during the first cycle of startup and shutdown is ignorable and it can be considered equal to zero the walking of the subsequent cycles can be calculated by using the following equation developed in the safebuck project carr and sinclair 2006 a 1 δ l 2 16 e a 24 f θ f f θ 4 f i f 2 f θ 3 f f θ 6 δ f l 2 8 e a i f 2 f θ 3 f f θ 6 from sabuck jip f μ ω s u b friction force carr and sinclair f θ e a α q θ thermal force 2006 this equation is valid only for linear transient profiles and when the thermal gradient qθ in the equation is constant along the pipeline also it should be noted that it is valid only for straight pipelines a new fe analysis for a straight pipeline similar to section 4 1 is carried out using a transient temperature profile in a linear shape figure a 1 shows the linear transient temperature profiles that are applied on the model the thermal gradient qθ in figure a 1 is 0 02 c m it should be noted that the implemented linear transient temperature profiles are not realistic however they are used just for comparing the fe and analytical results fig a 1 pipeline start up and shut down transient temperature profiles in linear form fig a 1 the results of the calculated walking based on the fe model is illustrated in figure a 2 that properly matches with the analytical results according to the eq a 1 fig a 2 walk per cycle range for fem and analytical solution fig a 2 
22312,various factors influence the design of subsea pipeline subjected to high temperature and pressure operating loads cycles of operating shut down and start up have been shown to cause pipeline axial movement which is called walking walking can influence pipeline performance and cause lateral deflection amplitudes at buckled zones as a result of walking and lateral buckling interaction a novel cost effective method for walking mitigation is investigated in this paper using of fe modeling to simulate the novel way of eliminating the occurrence of walking the proposed technique for mitigating pipeline walking involves creating initial local lateral deformations along the pipeline via imposed local curvature during pipeline reel laying the interaction between walking and lateral buckling is also explored for an example pipeline with initial local deformations imposed at regular small intervals along the pipeline the effects of the residual curvatures on pipeline response to temperature and pressure loading are considered in this paper the reduction in walking rate of subsea pipelines with different numbers of initial deformations is considered furthermore a continuous snake lay form of deformations is proposed as a very effective method for controlling walking and attaining virtually a zero value of incremental walking per cycle keywords subsea pipelines walking lateral buckling reel laying continuous snake lay abbreviations eaf effective axial force fe finite element imp imperfections jip joint industry project kp kilometre point vap virtual anchor point ht high temperature hp high pressure psi pipe soil interaction δ walking per cycle 1 introduction a primary function of a subsea flowline may be to transport hot gas from a well head to a designed destination axial expansions of the pipe due to gas transportation generally take place via different operating fluid pressures and temperatures at either end of the pipe as a result flowline safe operation in high temperature and pressure conditions is an industry challenge because of such operating loads on the pipeline and expansions along the pipe length as a natural tendency of steel pipe friction forces between a pipeline and the seabed act to resist this axial movement and when the axial driving force exceeds the soil resistance force pipeline axial displacement occurs several cycles of shut down and start up may occur through the design life of an offshore field that can vary the pipe loading state cyclic variation of pipe temperature may lead to global axial displacement which is known as pipeline walking after each shut down and start up event the pipeline moves bodily axially accumulation of the incremental axial movements may occur due to loading by the cyclic heating and cooling during start up product flow from the wellhead causes asymmetry with regard to the mid length of the flowline in temperature profiles throughout the flowline s route consequently one end of the pipe would be warmer than the other end during the pipeline heat up and pipe global movement would take place usually toward the cold end bruton et al 2006 on the other hand cooling usually takes place after shut down and pipe temperature cooling is assumed to reduce virtually uniformly along the length of the pipe from the fully heated temperature to the relevant ambient temperature a pipeline is a flexible uni directional structure that tends to relieve high axial compressive forces through developing lateral deformations lateral buckling in a subsea pipeline and deflected pipe dimensions might lead to failure because of high strains imposed at a pipe s section during cyclic thermal loads da costa et al 2002 axial load reduction at a laterally buckled zone potentially could result in changes in pipeline walking response alternatively pre deformed pipe installed over specific distances can be utilized to mitigate pipeline walking as described in following sections of the paper the behavior of lightweight pipes subjected to cyclic loading and pipe soil interaction effect on pipe response has been studied by bruton et al 2008 it was noted that dividing long pipelines into a series of short pipelines can also result in pipeline walking occurrence accumulative displacements induced by walking during the entire life of the system can be extensive and lead to severe problems for the integrity of the flowline axial walking throughout lifetime in some projects can be more than 30 m bruton et al 2006 as a consequence of this extraordinary movement of subsea pipelines many consequences may arise such as overloading spool pieces or jumpers carr et al 2003 route curve stability of pipeline pipe end expansion and feed in to lateral buckles are other consequences bruton et al 2008 the presence of these consequences emphasizes the need to control and mitigate the extent of the axial movements of a flowline during the design phase pre laying installation of subsea buckle initiating sleepers can be implemented as a mitigation technique for both walking and lateral buckling deformations of deepwater pipelines perinet and simon 2011 different lateral buckling and walking mitigation techniques comprising snake lay sleepers rock dumping and anchors have been evaluated in practical projects based on industry experience these mitigation methods are costly and the approximate required budget for such mitigations could be about 10 of the flowline cost perinet and simon 2011 another methodology to mitigate the pipeline buckling is use of buoyancy sections pipeline performance with distributed buoyancy modulus to mitigate lateral buckling was evaluated by antunes et al 2010 in the pipeline design procedure the effect of buoyancy sections on buckle pattern feed in dimension and virtual anchor spacing must be considered in case of long distance between two designed imperfections locations buckles may occur in any initial out of straightness deformation somewhere between these two unintentional out of straightness may also happen by free span that can trigger the buckling in an unplanned location seyfipour et al 2016 seyfipour and bahaari 2018 a residual curvature method as a cost effective method has been utilized in some projects such as skuld and edradour cooper et al 2017 for controlling lateral buckling performance via created imperfections along the pipe during reel laying operation application of the residual curvature method for mitigating potential high walking rate of short pipelines and interaction between walking and buckling are investigated in the present paper using an example flowline geometry which is described in detail in following sections also the effects of the number of initial deformations on walking rate are evaluated as a controlled walking strategy during pipeline design process furthermore an optimized shape of pipeline route in continuous snake lay pattern is proposed and discussed as providing complete control of a flowline walking condition 2 finite element analysis 2 1 model detail axial walking analysis of a subsea pipeline induced by high temperature and high pressure loading is assessed here fe modeling using abaqus software abaqus analysis user s manual 2014 simulates the walking phenomenon an example flowline with free to move boundary conditions at both ends is modelled by deformable pipe elements over a seabed modelled as a rigid flat horizontal surface the pipeline model uses the pipe31h element type from the abaqus library which is a three dimensional two noded linear pipe element with a hybrid formulation the pipe elements length is 0 5m abaqus analysis user s manual 2014 finite element modeling incorporates all nonlinearities including large deformations and plastic behavior of steel materials the data for the example flowline model are presented in table 1 gravity load is applied at the initial step in the fe analysis pipe soil friction is defined at the initial step and friction force is mobilized after applying the gravity load and then the internal pressure is applied to the pipe 2 2 pipe soil interaction soil axial resistance is quite straightforward however lateral friction can be different based on the pipeline embedment on seabed white and cheuk 2008 seabed friction forces rely on pipe displacement in lateral and axial directions soil resistance force usually reaches the maximum force at very small pipeline lateral deformation values then it reduces to a residual resistance force lateral friction but not axial friction in larger deformations of the pipe soil interface plastic response the soil friction model presented in fig 1 is employed in the fe model to account for pipe movements in axial and lateral directions as used by chee et al 2018 2019 this model and similar models have been used widely by others in recent pipe soil interaction studies axial friction response is defined by a modified elasto plastic interaction model mobilization of maximum axial friction occurs in a very small displacement this frictional mobilization length is assumed to be 5 mm this first part of bi linear model is linear which shows elastic slip at the initial phase of pipe loading for larger displacement values the purely axial friction coefficient is assumed to equal 0 5 resistance to lateral movements for subsea pipelines is not as simple as the model for axial resistance the influence of soil berms through the lateral movement is emphasized in this model the maximum friction coefficient is assumed to occur after 30 mm of lateral movement with brittle breakout as a result of berm formation when lateral breakout resistance reaches the maximum value sliding occurs at a lower resistance value and the friction coefficient varies from 1 to 0 5 depending of the ploughing by the pipe on the seabed surface cyclic pipe soil interaction behavior during lateral displacements is schematically shown in fig 2 at the initial step of the heat up process cycle 1 heat up 1 the pipeline moves lateraly as shown in fig 2 effects of soil hardening and an initial embedment of the pipeline into the seabed soil can be considered in the friction coefficient and the final seabed resistance force the maximum lateral displacement occurs once the temprature reaches to the operational temperature cycle 1 heat up 7 during the cool down stage the pipeline moves in the reverse direction a similar cyclic response is considered for the axial movement without the hardening effect chee et al 2018 the resistance force of seabed soil is defined in the model by appling the friction coefficient on the fe model pipe soil interaction model is defined by using an abaqus subroutine called fric which controls the axial and lateral movements of the pipeline in order to ensure the correctness of the fric subroutine action and its corresponding fe results a verification analysis is carried out and the results are provided in appendix a 2 3 temperature transient profiles after the gravity load and pipe soil interaction temperature variation is added in subsequent steps of the analysis one major factor for the walking phenomena is transient thermal profiles along the line hot fluid flowing from one end of the subsea pipeline which is surrounded by seawater at ambient temperature condition can progressively warm the steel pipe once the hot gas flows through the pipe after the start up state the steel pipe temperature increases asymmetrically relative to mid length of the flowline based on the defined temperature profiles along the pipe length so during the start up process one end of the pipeline is warmer than the other end in diverse forms of gradient profiles during heat up stages the slope of these heat up profiles can meaningfully change the walking rate carr et al 2003 during each well shut down occurrence it is assumed that the pipe loses heat fairly uniformly over the pipe length during the cooling process and the shut down time is long enough to attain seabed ambient conditions along the full length of the pipeline shape of thermal transient profiles can have a significant influence in determining the axial walking rate previous attempts to formulate the walking phenomena have been prepared based on simplified linear form of the shapes of transient profiles carr and sinclair 2006 in the present paper temperature profiles are assumed to be based on a more realistic configuration some sophisticated models are available for heat transfer performance that depends on many different characteristics of pipeline and the fluid properties fluid density fluid specific heat average external temperature fluid temperature fluid flow rate etc are some parameters influencing the temperature profile shape bai and bai 2005 guo et al 2006 in this study the assumed transient temperature profiles along the pipeline for different steps of heat up and cool down conditions are shown graphically in fig 3 a constant ambient temperature 12 c is considered along the pipe at the primary step subsequent heat up and cool down phases with different temperature variation rate between the hot end kp 0 and the cold end kp 4 881 points as shown in fig 3 are defined in the fem start up stages are displayed in seven steps from heat up 1 to heat up 7 and shut down stages are defined in four steps from cool down 1 to cool down 4 these temperature profiles are implemented for all analyses in this paper except the analysis in the appendix section 3 pipeline as laid configurations different patterns of the subsea pipeline on seabed are assessed in the paper comprising a straight pipeline with no deformation and lateraly deformed pipelines 3 1 straight pipeline the maximum walking rate occurs in a pipeline which is laid in a straight condition the walking mechanism of a straight pipeline is analysed first to provide a basis for comparison with walking mitigation techniques in subsequent sections proposed in the present paper thus a straight pipeline with 4881m length is considered to be subjected to cyclic thermal load variations the configuration of the pipeline along the installed pipeline route has a significant influence on the walking response 3 2 residual curvature from reel laying because of the high walking rate of a straight pipeline engineers are required to pursue a solution to eliminate or mitigate it also a high axial compressive force has a significant effect in increasing the susceptibility to uncontrolled lateral buckling of the pipeline on the other hand ensuring controlled buckles along the pipeline is an efficient method to relieve high compressive forces within this strategy predefined lateral deformations called imperfections created at regular intervals along pipelines can be used to reduce the compressive longitudinal force by initiating buckles at specified intervals along the pipe length residual curvature from reel laying operation and pre deformed lateral buckles are proposed in the present paper as a mechanism to reduce axial compressive forces along the pipeline the residual curvatures at regular distances can divide the pipeline into short pipelines between buckles lateral buckling formation depends on the initial imperfection size this imperfection is presented in fig 4 with about 0 2 initial strain as a practical case cooper et al 2017 although the assumed value for initial strain is 0 2 actual strain values may vary between 0 15 and 0 25 residual curvature can be created during the laying operation by the straightener device of a reel lay installation vessel tewolde 2017 residual curvature method as a cost effective solution is described in following sections of this paper as an attractive design method for mitigating walking and uncontrolled lateral deformations i e buckling of un buried pipeline on the seabed a new approach to employ the residual curvature method with the intention of mitigated walking response of short pipelines is assessed in this paper through simulation of fe analyses initial curvature is one of the significant factors which affects structural response an assumed example curvature chee et al 2018 is considered as the initial condition for the as installed shape of the pipeline in order to evaluate structural integrity the combined influences of axial and lateral movements at each cycle of start up and shut down of the pipeline are considered schematic buckle development at imperfection location because of thermal forces is also depicted in fig 4 3 3 continuous snake lay based on a wide range of fe analyses and results that were described in previous sections of the present paper a new configuration of pipeline geometry on seabed is further considered as a means to mitigate the walking phenomenon the continuous snake lay shape is developed to potentially minimise the walking rate of ht hp pipelines a schematic drawing of the pipeline configuration is depicted in fig 5 in this method pipeline route is defined in zigzag form instead of the straight shape ten crowns i e location of maximum lateral deformation are defined along the pipe with radii equal to 0 12l where l represents total length of the pipeline the amplitude of each crown and each lobe length are assumed l 100 and l 10 respectively 4 results 4 1 walking of a straight pipeline during the design procedure engineers focus on effective axial force eaf profiles which are reliant on temperature pressure pipeline submerged weight and seabed friction force dnv 2010 pipeline response as a short pipeline and possibility of walking phenomena are illustrated in eaf profiles in fig 6 compressive and tensile effective forces during the first cycle of startup and shut down are presented in that figure the response of the straight pipeline shows how the maximum effective axial force can occur in a virtual anchor position vap at the flowline mid length the maximum axial load will be induced when the axial friction is mobilized throughout the pipe length the flowline is not constrained and is free to expand at both ends where the axial effective force is zero internal pressure is applied to the pipe in the initial step of the first cycle and causes an axial compressive effective force following this very small applied temperature is required to reach a fully mobilized psi condition the compressive axial force is highest at the inlet end of the pipe during warm up steps prior to the fully heat up condition first cycle heat up 1 to heat up 6 the tensile axial force in the flowline during cool down is almost symmetric because of the assumed virtually uniform cool down temperature profiles when the pipeline is re heated during the second start up cycle the distribution of effective axial load in heat up steps will differ from the first cycle because of residual tension in the pipeline from the first cycle effective axial force profiles for subsequent cycles after the initial one are shown in fig 7 pipeline incremental movements toward the cold end and resultant tension forces can change the longitudinal force distribution during the heat up steps the effective axial force diagram governs the walking behavior and probability of lateral buckling unsymmetrical axial force distribution during heat up steps causes non uniform expansion which leads to axial walking assumed more or less uniform cool down profiles cause almost symmetrical unloading profiles during the shut down stages the eaf profile in each step is induced by the applied temperature profile in that particular stage for example cycle2 heat up 2 and cycle2 cool down 1 profiles in fig 7 represent temperature transient profiles heat up 2 and cool down 1 in fig 3 respectively accordingly changing shape and slope of temperature transient profiles can amend the eaf and consequently change the walking rate cumulative axial movements at the flowline mid length section and at both ends of the pipe toward the cold end are illustrated in fig 8 incremental movements per cycle for these three points of the straight flowline are presented in fig 9 the incremental walking movement per cycle is constant 272 3 mm after the second cycle considering 50 cycles of start up and shut down during the service lifetime of the line the cumulative displacement towards the cold end would be about 13 3 m that has to be prevented or accommodated in the pipeline design the axial movement of the mid length section of the pipeline determines walking incremental walking at the first step is insignificant because of the internal pressure effect on the axial load which is uniformly applied along the pipeline and only a very small temperature is required to create the fully mobilized situation in contrast with the first cycle the compressive axial loads in subsequent cycles are not symmetric as previously shown in fig 7 which causes asymmetric expansion and a higher rate of incremental axial movement also it is observed that the incremental walking rate which is the non recoverable portion of axial movement for different points along the straight pipe are equal after the second cycle of temperature variation cumulative walking for the entire length of the straight pipeline is illustrated in fig 10 the maximum expansion in each cycle occurs at the highest temperature condition heat up 7 and residual axial displacement after each cycle is presented in cool down 4 curves a different range of expansion is observed throughout the pipe length during each cycle the two free ends of the pipeline experience the maximum range of cyclic displacement whereas permanent walking per cycle is constant along the pipe after the second cycle for instance axial displacement difference between cycle 10 cool down 4 and cycle 9 cool down 4 is constant over the pipe length which shows the overall movement of the pipeline toward the cold end the maximum walking rate of walking is investigated through the analysis of an example of a straight pipeline with no lateral imperfections considered as a basis for comparison with more complex novel analysis results the effective axial force profiles for the straight pipeline show that the maximum effective force relates in a so called short pipeline with no lateral deformation a significant walking response of the mid line section of the pipeline was generated due to assumed temperature gradient profiles the calculated axial movement for a specified number of operation cycles was 0 27m 4 2 three applications of residual curvatures along the pipe in this section the same straight pipeline exemplified in section 4 1 with three sections of imposed lateral deformations along the pipeline is studied the initial deformations are assumed to be generated during the reel laying and may trigger additional lateral movements i e lateral buckling at these three locations all initial out of straightness is created at the same distance with identical shape as illustrated in fig 4 subsequently the longitudinal force due to applied operating temperature and pressure will decrease noticeably at the buckled positions compressive and tensile effective axial force distributions along the total length of the pipeline during the initial cycle are shown in fig 11 by utilizing three equally spaced imposed deformations pipeline is virtually divided into four sections the maximum axial forces are generated at four virtual anchor points along the pipeline because of the reduction of the effective axial force at buckle locations pipeline length is a key parameter in pipeline buckling bruton 2005 so by dividing the pipeline in these four segments by imposing three separate buckles in between buckling rate can be different from the straight pipeline the variations of effective axial forces along the pipe during the second cycle of start up and shut down are shown in fig 12 it is seen that the maximum absolute value of compressive axial load decreases at each cycle in contrast to the maximum tensile load which increases at subsequent cycles of start up and shut down this variation in the maximum value of longitudinal force in subsequent cycles is due to the residual tensile forces caused by pipeline axial movements in each cycle regarding the four sections between vaps and pipeline ends the axial load distribution history during heat up is different for one section to another this variation in the axial forces causes different walking rates for the four sections different axial forces at three buckle locations may also result in different buckle behaviors as in the present case the buckle shape and maximum lateral deflection can be different at these three sections the pipeline axial movements during the initial start up and shut down are shown in fig 13 due to the increasing temperature during the first heat up the pipeline expands separately at each section at the middle step of heat up i e cycle 1 heat up 3 the expansion rate for the hotter sections of the buckled pipe i e the left side section is higher than the cold side sections this variation in the different rate of expansion shows the effect of defined heat up transient temperature profile for each section the full heat up step i e cycle 1 heat up 7 represents the peak axial movement in the first cycle pipeline uniform cool down is shown by the cycle 1 cool down 2 curve the full shut down situation cycle 1 cool down 4 demonstrates incremental axial movement along the pipeline as result of the loading history and seabed friction the general expansion behavior of each section is displayed in fig 13 and this behavior shows how the pipeline moves towards the cold end in each section it can be seen that expansion occurs at both side of each virtual anchored point during the cool down process the pipeline tends to return to its previous position however the seafloor friction force restricts the pipe contraction a significant expansion is observed at the full heat up state maximum operating condition and the maximum axial expansions at both ends of the pipeline are presented in fig 13 which can be a challenge for pipeline design fig 14 shows the cumulative pipeline axial movement at full shut down condition ambient temperature during 10 cycles of loading the cumulative longitudinal displacement after each cycle represents the pipeline walking behavior pipeline buckling and walking together lead to different amounts of walking in four sections along the pipeline the schematic graph of lateral deformation is depicted in fig 14 the dissimilar rate of walking at both ends of each buckle leads to asymmetric buckle configuration pipe expansion is different in each section thus the feed in lengths of lateral buckles will be different the dashed line in fig 14 presents the pipeline expansion under pressure load at the initial step of analysis subsequent loading procedures for cyclic change in temperature induces various ranges of axial walking from hot end to cold end of the pipeline during the cool down pipeline movement will reduce close to the virtual anchor positions however axial friction forces prevent it from returning to the initial positions as shown in the present example this residual axial displacement after four cycles of heating and cooling is presented by cycle4 cool down 4 profile subsequent cycles represent the tendency of the pipeline to move bodily toward the cold end ve axial displacement pipe axial movements in separate sections may be considered as a chain of independently moving pipe sections dissimilar walking associated with lateral buckling causes different buckle configurations and dimensions progressive deformation of the pipeline caused by increasing numbers of loading cycles over the system lifetime might result in serious practical consequences a walking mitigation method for such a system may have different results in each pipeline section because of altered axial movements non uniform transient temperature profiles cause various buckle site to be initiated during first heat up and different ranges of walking rate at each section lead to asymmetric buckle shapes during subsequent cycles axial strains along the pipe are affected by temperature pressure and bending moment variations an additional axial strain variation history during one start up cycle is presented in fig 15 these values show only additional axial strain during the heat up and the total axial strain can be calculated by adding the initial strain assumed to be 0 2 to the additional strain also the total strain can be calculated by considering the hoop strain effect the maximum axial strain will occur in buckled zones because of the relatively extreme curvatures at these pipe sections between the three buckles the middle one will reach the peak value of longitudinal strain because of its longer feed in length the reduction of the axial strain occurs at the four virtual anchor points that indicate the influence of soil friction on the pipe s strain because of seabed restriction on the pipe expansion at feed in lengths because of high axial load and pipeline deformations at the buckled zone a large level of axial strain will occur at the crown of a buckle along a pipeline with 3 imperfection sections the maximum axial strain occurs at the full heat up condition maximum operating condition of the first cycle which is 0 58 for the model with three imperfections i e 0 2 initial strain plus 0 38 additional axial strain the interaction between buckling and walking is a crucial phenomenon which may have serious consequences for pipeline integrity and it can build up into un symmetric buckle forms the check for the maximum strain level located at the crown of the middle imperfection is a key parameter for the system safety check also the reduction of the effective axial force and lateral buckling can create an extreme strain along the pipeline the lateral deflections of the middle buckle in the pipeline operational phase for ten cycles of start up and shut down are shown in fig 16 for the displacement in comparison to the initial position of pipeline it may be seen how walking can feed into the buckle and enlarge the buckled shape and the development of lateral deformation at a buckled section during start up and shut down cycles the reason for this cyclic growth in lateral deflection is the walking effect that can increase the initial deflection at each cycle the general buckle mode shape also varies at each cycle and this transformation will be determined by the initial imperfection at first cycle and the buckle positions along the pipeline and the transient temperature profiles the cyclic buckle development shows that the walking phenomenon can be a severe problem when it interacts with buckling these different buckle shapes after each cycle represent possible changes in other structural parameters the graph in fig 16 is presented for the specific situation as described during the fem presentation and any change in model such as a different friction coefficient may lead into a different lateral deflection nonetheless the growth of lateral deflection after each cycle shows how it can absorb the energy via lateral movement pipe bending and change in the axial movement along the pipe walking contributes to feed in to pipeline buckled sections and as a result increase of lateral deformations are observed after each cycle such deformations might lead to failure during the pipeline design lifecycles as an example of this factor the maximum lateral deflection for three imperfection model is calculated to be 4 34m for the first cycle and 6m for the tenth cycle which shows about 28 buckle size growth because of the walking effect the axial force variation history at the mid line section during 10 cycles of start up and shut down is illustrated in fig 17 applying internal pressure on pipeline with pre deformed imperfections leads to generation of compressive axial loading in the initial step the maximum compressive load at a pipe section will occur during the first start up at critical buckling temperature the critical buckling state is dependent on the initial strain which is considered about 0 2 as a result from the residual curvature during laying operation previously shown in fig 4 compressive axial load will decrease after establishment of the buckling state first shut down leads to generation of tensile loading in the pipeline section because of reduction in lateral deflection and seabed restriction to this movement the similar loading history occurs for following cycles of temperature variation between ambient temperatures 12 c to the maximum temperature at mid line section pipeline walking generates a permanent tensile load at each cycle so the maximum axial tensile load increases with each shut down residual tension after each cycle can be one of the major concerns for some projects because of overloading spool pieces and jumpers carr et al 2003 effective axial force as a function of temperature governs the buckle development severity of lateral buckling must be controlled which can be altered during temperature fluctuations when first the pipeline is exposed to internal pressure and temperature the compressive axial along the pipeline will be the highest value through whole operating life after each loading and unloading the pipeline shape cannot recover the previous configuration and consequently walking will build up additional tension along the pipeline the lower range of axial compressive force in subsequent cycles builds into a variable structural response additional tension after each cycle can also impact on the maximum strain value generated strain at the crown of each buckle decreases in subsequent cycles and the maximum strain value occurs during the first heat up fig 15 because of the residual tension cumulative walking comparison between two models including straight pipeline and three imperfections cases are illustrated in fig 18 and incremental walk per cycle results are presented in fig 19 results from the straight pipeline condition are presented in continuous curve for the virtual anchor point at the mid line location which is 0 27 m cycle after 10 cycles of start up and shut down the predicted level of through life axial movements for this pipeline without imperfection is high and requires to be modified to accommodate this level of axial walking movement four dashed curves represent different ranges of walk rate for each of the virtual anchor points generated in the three imperfections model it is observed that employing these three intended imperfection results in about 88 reduction in walking of the whole pipeline towards its cold end using these three imperfections can significantly reduce the pipeline walking rate 4 3 walking rate reduction in order to determine the pipeline walking and buckling interaction mechanism a series of finite element models are developed in abaqus software these models are created based on different number of imperfections along the pipe using the same imperfection configuration as shown in fig 4 the trajectory of permanent walking per cycle for each virtual anchor point along the pipe is reported in fig 20 for example for the case with 3 initial lateral deformations 4 vaps occur between buckles and free ends walking per cycle for these four points after 10 cycles are presented in this figure a similar method is applied for other cases and walking results are presented in fig 20 the highlighted section shows the reduction trend of walking rate by increasing number of lateral crowns all points illustrated are measured data on each case and two dashed lines represent maximum and minimum values for each case 4 4 continuous snake lay the eaf along the pipe during the first cycle of startup and shut down is displayed in fig 21 the pipeline is virtually divided into nine sections between eight buckles that occur throughout the pipe the effective axial force during subsequent cycles is presented in fig 22 the maximum value of eaf is about 0 41 mn for the model prepared in the continuous snake lay shape which is much lower than the eaf 1 7 mn in the straight pipeline figs 6 and 7 this reduction in the cyclic axial force during the pipline system s lifetime can significantly change the pipeline response the difference between the maximum value of tensile and compressive eaf can noticeably influence the walking rate which is much smaller in the continuous snake lay method in comparison to the straight pipeline because of the low eaf at both ends of the pipe no buckle occurs at the first and last crown locations axial displacements along the continuous snake laid pipeline during the initial cycle of startup and shut down are presented in fig 23 because of temperature profiles fig 3 applied to the model expansion is primarily mobilized at the hot end the maximum expansion occurred at two ends of the pipe which can be easily absorbed by spool pieces the continuous snake laid pipe is free to sweep sideways and through this lateral movement it can absorb much of the energy induced by thermal force thus axial expansion is significantly lower than the corresponding straight pipeline case the cumulative axial movement at the mid line location from the fem results during ten cycles of temperature cycling along the pipeline is shown in fig 24 for both straight pipeline and continuous snake lay models results provide a comparison is presented in fig 24 for cumulative axial movement the calculated axial displacement at the mid point of the straight pipeline is 2 45m after 10 cycles in contrast virtually no axial movement occurs in the continuous snake lay option a different scaled graph of axial movement of continuous lay case is also provided in fig 24 in order to illustrate cyclic movement of the mid point during temperature variation which is about 0 13m axial expansion during the heat up is completely recoverable in shut down phase consequently no walking is detected for this model corresponding incremental walking per cycle results are presented in fig 25 which shows 0 27 m walking movement per cycle for the straight pipe whereas virtually zero incremental walking movement per cycle is calculated for the continuous snake lay case showing an entirely controlled walking phenomenon in a feasible laying method lateral displacement in the continuous snake lay from the initial route position is illustrated in fig 26 a graphic view with altered scale is also presented to provide a zoom in view at kp2 2 location information is provided for 10 cycles of temperature variation at full heat up condition heat up 7 the maximum lateral deflection for the continuous snake lay condition is calculated to be equal to 3 3m with a negligible growth in subsequent cycles the distance between the pipe s section at each crown location to the virtual straight route is 48 81m l 100 in fig 5 at the initial phase which changes to 52 1 m at the maximum operating condition furthermore there is virtually no walking to feed into the buckle during subsequent cycles the axial strain development during the initial heat up is shown in fig 27 for the calculated structural integrity of the continuous snake laid pipeline it is seen the initial strain at the crown locations is 0 03 and the additional strain during warm up is illustrated the peak axial strain occurs at operation phase heat up 7 as a result the lower compressive eaf in continuous snake lay has a generated strains lower than the model with three pre deformed sections fig 15 moreover because of smaller deflection at the buckle locations less significant bending strain is generated at buckle positions in consideration of 2 28 times higher strain in the pipeline with three imperfections noticeable superior structural response observed in the continuous snake lay option 5 conclusion a wide range of finite element analyses have been performed and reported here to investigate the walking rate of subsea pipelines and what measures can be taken to slow or eliminate the rate initial work is carried out on an example straight pipeline to demonstrate the mechanisms and levels of axial walking for example ranges of temperature and pressure the objective of that work is to provide a basis on which to assess the effects of introducing initial out of straightness along the example pipeline the out of straightness is considered to be a possible cost effective force mitigation method introduced to result in reduction of the walking rate interaction of walking and lateral buckling is explored for various conditions of an initial geometry of the example pipeline and the walking rate reduction trend is related to the number of buckles along the pipe finally a continuous snake lay method with significant potential to control walking is proposed and subjected to finite element modeling the main conclusions are summarized as follow an efficient practical method for mitigating the walking rate through creation of initial deformations during pipeline installation has been investigated the effect of initial out of straightness caused by residual curvatures imposed during reel laying operation is investigated through a series of analyses of lateral buckling and walking behavior the finite element model with three pre deformed out of straightness imperfections along the pipe shows that the initially straight pipe is effectively divided into four shorter pipelines by introducing the pre deformations in the deformed sections the effective operating axial force is reduced by 70 because of the reduced distance between virtual cold and hot buckle limits and dividing the pipeline into shorter segments different loading conditions in each subdivision section of the finite element model with three pre deformed sections lead to various walking rates in each section which are considerably lower than is calculated for the initially straight pipeline the average walking rate for this case is approximately 88 lower than the initially straight pipe i e 0 12 x 0 27m 0 032m the walking rate reduction is considered to depend on the number of buckles initiated along the pipeline and has been explored in the present paper one buckle along the pipeline decreases the walking by about 75 when compared to the corresponding straight pipe with no buckles the corresponding reduction ratio for ten buckles case is about 98 which shows a very effective basis for minimizing the effects of axial walking the continuous snake lay method for including regular lateral deformations along an originally straight pipeline is proposed this is concluded to provide an effective method for ensuring controlled levels of walking without requiring any further walking mitigation action fe modeling of an example continuous snake laid pipeline shows about 76 reduction of imposed eaf in comparison to the straight pipe option for the same maximum operating conditions the finite element modeling of cyclic loading of the pipeline with many initially imposed lateral deformations shows that the walking movement of the pipeline is negligible compared to the original walking of the straight pipeline the maximum axial expansion in an example straight pipeline is about 4 68 times larger than the continuous snake lay model furthermore small axial expansion in the continuous snake lay model during heat up is completely recovered through the shut down phase consequently virtually no walking is observed in this system the maximum lateral deformation in continuous snake lay model is 3 3m with eight buckle sites however 4 34m deflection is detected in the first start up of the pipeline with three imperfections there is a noteworthy buckle growth during subsequent cycles in the model with three imperfections but a trivial growth is observed in subsequent cycles for the continuous snake laid pipe an appropriate structural integrity response is measured for the continuous snake lay model the maximum axial strain in the pipeline with three imperfections is 0 58 and it is 0 25 in the continuous snake lay which shows important lower strain and increased safety at the pipeline initially deformed sections appendix a fem verification the appendix is provided to verify the fem used in the paper and compare it with an analytical solution in the literature analytical study of subsea pipeline walking proposed in safebuck project carr and sinclair 2006 was generated based on an assumption of linear transient temperature profiles as presented in the safebuck project walking of the pipeline during the first cycle of startup and shutdown is ignorable and it can be considered equal to zero the walking of the subsequent cycles can be calculated by using the following equation developed in the safebuck project carr

this equation is valid only for linear transient profiles and when the thermal gradient qθ in the equation is constant along the pipeline also it should be noted that it is valid only for straight pipelines a new fe analysis for a straight pipeline similar to section 4 1 is carried out using a transient temperature profile in a linear shape figure a 1 shows the linear transient temperature profiles that are applied on the model the thermal gradient qθ in figure a 1 is 0 02 c m it should be noted that the implemented linear transient temperature profiles are not realistic however they are used just for comparing the fe and analytical results fig a 1 pipeline start up and shut down transient temperature profiles in linear form fig a 1 the results of the calculated walking based on the fe model is illustrated in figure a 2 that properly matches with the analytical results according to the eq a 1 fig a 2 walk per cycle range for fem and analytical solution fig a 2 
22313,a hybrid higher order boundary element method hobem within the framework of potential flow theory in frequency domain is developed for solving ship hydrodynamic problems with forward speed the method introduces a wall sided artificial control surface to decompose the fluid domain into two subdomains one encompassing the ship and the other on the outside to guarantee the radiation condition at infinite for any frequency the translating pulsating green s function method with singularities distributed on the control surface is used in the outer domain the panel integrals of the green s function are evaluated by a robust and efficient semi analytical scheme in the inner domain the rankine panel method rpm is adopted and the steady flow effects are considered in the free surface and body surface conditions the integral equation imposed on the inner boundaries is discretized and solved by a numerical approach of hobem based on bi quadratic isoparametric elements by imposing the continuous conditions of velocity potential and its normal derivative on the control surface the solutions in the two domains are matched and a coupled equation system is formulated for the velocity potential on boundaries through the calculations of radiation and diffraction forces on a mathematical ship model the present method is proved to have good mesh convergence and satisfactory results can be obtained in a relatively small computational domain the present hybrid hobem is applied to evaluate the hydrodynamic responses of ships sailing in head and oblique waves numerical simulations

reliable estimation of ship hydrodynamics such as wave loads motion responses and added resistance is of crucial importance for both the design and operation of ship structures over the past few decades numerous studies have been devoted to the development of numerical methods for the hydrodynamic calculations of ships in waves the wave body interactions at zero speed can now be predicted with satisfactory accuracy but when it comes to the forward speed case the current hydrodynamic computations are still far from a mature engineering science the numerical study on hydrodynamic responses of ships with forward speed in waves may start from the middle twentieth century when the strip theory was first proposed by korvin kroukovsky 1955 after that various forms of strip theory based methods were developed these strip methods are fast and can to a certain extent produce satisfactory results for some conditions so even today they are still widely used as an engineering tool for the ship hydrodynamic calculations however the strip theory is a two dimensional 2d theory there are some inherent deficiencies in the application of a 2d method to a three dimensional 3d problem it has been shown in the published literature that the strip theory is mainly limited to the slender ships with low speed and high frequency situation to overcome these limitations fully 3d methods were gradually developed in recent years since the pioneering work of hess and smith 1964 the 3d panel method or boundary element method bem based on potential flow theory has gained the most popularity the original panel method employs a simple rankine source as the kernel in the boundary integral equation bie the main advantages of the rankine panel method rpm are that the rankine source is easy to calculate and it allows a flexible choice of the free surface conditions so far many efforts have been devoted to study and apply the rpm in the unsteady ship hydrodynamics problem nakos and sclavounos 1991 kim and kim 2010 he and kashiwagi 2014 chen et al 2018a but there still remain some limitations for the extensive use of it for example because the rankine source does not satisfy the free surface condition we need to distribute singularities not only on the ship hull but also on the free surface which will consequently increase the computation cost in addition for ships in infinite fluid domain the free surface has to be truncated so as to obtain a finite region for the numerical implementation this will bring truncation errors and make the radiation condition hard to be satisfied especially when the brard number τ τ uω e g is less than 0 25 yasuda et al 2016 besides the above mentioned rankine panel method another alternative 3d panel method that can be used for the hydrodynamic analysis of ships advancing in waves is the free surface green s function method in this method the green s function automatically satisfying the neumann kelvin or uniform flow linearization free surface condition and radiation condition is used so the singularities are only required to be distributed on the mean wetted body surface the key of this method is the evaluation of the green s function it is in the 1940s that the first mathematical formulation for the free surface green s function was derived haskind 1946 the original formulation is in a double fourier integral form which is complex and not suitable for numerical computation in view of this the researchers devoted a lot of effort to simplifying it and derived various single integral forms of the green s function havelock 1958 bessho 1977 wu and eatock taylor 1987 based on these single integral forms some efficient computational algorithms maury et al 2003 yao and dong 2014 hong et al 2016a were developed recently which makes it possible to use the free surface green s function method to solve the hydrodynamic problems of ships with forward speed compared with the rpm the free surface green s function method has advantages in that it does not require the free surface mesh and can guarantee the radiation condition for any brard number however due to the highly oscillatory of the green s function near the free surface chen 2000 numerical instability usually arises in the implementation of this method especially for ships with large flare in view of the limitations of using only one of the above two 3d panel methods a hybrid method combining both rankine source and free surface green s function was developed recently this method introduces an artificial control surface to decompose the fluid domain into two subdomains in the outer domain the free surface green s function is adopted while the rankine source is applied in the inner domain by using the hybrid method both the advantages of the rankine panel method and free surface green s function method can be exploited the idea of combination of different methods has already appeared in the research as early as 1970s yeung 1975 but it was not applied to ship hydrodynamic problems until the late 1990s when a 3d time domain hybrid boundary element method by combining rankine source and transient green s function is developed by the scholars duan and dai 1997 zhang et al 1998 to solve the hydrodynamic problems of non wall sided ships after that the research works of liu and papanikolaou 2011 tang et al 2014 and chen et al 2018b made further contributions to the development of the hybrid method in time domain however when it comes to the frequency domain hybrid method very little relevant work has been done so far and much of the work is of theoretical ten and chen 2010 or about the zero speed problem liang and chen 2017 as we know the hydrodynamic responses in frequency domain are generally the solutions to be preferred for the use in the design of ship structures kim 2005 compared to the frequency domain method liu et al 1991 li et al 2012 hong et al 2016a the time domain algorithm he and kashiwagi 2014 chen et al 2018a li et al 2019 is usually too time consuming to obtain the target solution so it is of great significance to study the hybrid method in frequency for the ship hydrodynamic problems with forward speed motivated by this a frequency domain hybrid higher order boundary element method hobem is developed in the present paper in this method a wall sided control surface in cuboid form is employed to divide the infinite fluid domain into an outer domain and an inner domain with the presence of floating bodies and within the framework of potential flow theory in frequency domain boundary integral equations using different green s functions are constructed in the two domains respectively the translating pulsating green s function is applied in the bie of outer domain since it satisfies the free surface and radiation conditions automatically the singularities are only needed to be distributed on the control surface by dividing the control surface into a series of panels a discrete bie is obtained for the outer domain in this discrete bie the panel integrals of the green s function are evaluated by a semi analytical scheme as for the bie in the inner domain the rankine source is used as the kernel function the sources are distributed on the entire inner boundaries including the inner free surface body surface and control surface and the steady flow effects are considered in the free surface and body surface conditions the inner bie is discretized and solved by the hobem which has been verified to be more accurate and efficient than the conventional constant panel method cpm in the previous studies liu et al 1991 zhang et al 2008 chen et al 2017 yang et al 2019 since the rankine source is easy to calculate the influence coefficients of the inner bie are evaluated directly by gauss legendre quadrature by combining the discrete bies in outer and inner domains we obtain a coupled linear equation system for the velocity potentials on the boundaries based on this hybrid hobem the hydrodynamic coefficients and wave exciting forces on a mathematical ship model modified wigley are computed and the numerical results indicate that the present method is of good convergence and accuracy the hybrid hobem is applied to the hydrodynamic calculations of ships advancing in waves motion responses of the modified wigley at fn 0 2 and the s175 containership at fn 0 275 in head waves are first calculated for comparison the experimental data and numerical results of the rankine panel method and translating pulsating green s function method are also shown in this paper the present hybrid hobem appears to have better stability and accuracy than the other numerical methods then numerical simulations are conducted on the s175 a newer container ship kcs and a more full formed ship s cb84 at various forward speeds the motion responses and added resistance in both head and oblique waves are calculated and analyzed the good agreement between the computed and experimental results indicates that the present hybrid hobem can produce satisfactory predictions for different ship types with different forward speeds and heading angles 2 mathematical model 2 1 problem description consider the problem of a ship advancing with the constant mean forward speed u in an oblique regular wave field of infinite depth to solve this problem a right handed cartesian coordinate system o xyz moving together with the ship is introduced see fig 1 the oxy plane is set on the undisturbed free surface with the x axis pointing opposite to the direction of forward motion the z axis points upward and crosses the gravity center of the ship the regular incident wave propagates in the direction with an angle β relative to the x axis the potential theory is adopted for the present ship motion analysis under the assumption of ideal and incompressible fluid with irrotational motion the velocity potential φ x y z t which satisfies the laplace s equation can be introduced to describe the fluid motion we decompose the potential φ into a steady and an unsteady parts 1 φ x y z t φ s x y z φ u x y z t where φ s is the time independent potential due to the steady forward motion of the ship φ u is the unsteady potential associated with the incident wave and ship s oscillatory motions by assuming the unsteady motions to be time harmonic in the linear theory the unsteady potential can be written in the form as follows 2 φ u x y z t re ϕ u x y z e i ω e t 3 ϕ u x y z ϕ 0 ϕ 7 j 1 6 i ω e x j ϕ j where ϕ u is the spatial part of the unsteady potential it is separated into the incident potential ϕ 0 the diffraction potential ϕ 7 and the radiation potential ϕ j j 1 2 6 due to the unit oscillation of the ship in the j th mode j 1 2 6 for surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw respectively x j denotes the complex amplitude of the oscillation in the j th mode ω e is the encounter frequency according to the linear wave theory the incident potential in deep water can be expressed as 4 ϕ 0 x y z a g i ω 0 e k z i k x cos β y sin β where ω 0 is the natural frequency k is the wave number a is the wave amplitude and g is the gravitational acceleration so for the unsteady problem the key point lies in the computation of the radiation and diffraction potentials ϕ j j 1 2 7 satisfying the laplace s equation in the fluid domain 5 2 ϕ j 0 2 2 flow field decomposition and boundary conditions in the present computation we introduce a wall sided control surface s c in cuboid form to divide the flow field into an outer domain and an inner domain see fig 2 the outer domain is bounded by s c the outer free surface s f o u t e r and the radiation boundary s at infinite while the boundaries of the inner domain include s c the mean wetted body surface s b and the inner free surface s f i n n e r in both outer and inner domains the velocity potential ϕ j is governed by the laplace s equation 5 2 2 1 boundary conditions for outer domain for the radiation and diffraction potentials ϕ j o u t e r in the outer domain the boundary conditions on the free surface s f o u t e r control surface s c and radiation boundary s should be satisfied 6 i ω e u x 2 ϕ j o u t e r g ϕ j o u t e r z 0 o n s f o u t e r 7 ϕ j o u t e r ϕ j i n n e r ϕ j o u t e r n o u t e r ϕ j i n n e r n i n n e r o n s c 8 lim r r ϕ j o u t e r r i k ϕ j o u t e r 0 o n s where n o u t e r and n i n n e r denote the unit outward normals of the outer and inner boundaries respectively and they point in opposite directions on the control surface i e n o u t e r n i n n e r on s c the uniform flow or neumann kelvin linearization free surface condition 6 is adopted on s f o u t e r so we can use the translating pulsating green s function which automatically satisfies the free surface and radiation conditions and the singularities are only needed to be distributed on the control surface to ensure the continuity of the velocity potential and its normal derivative the boundary condition 7 is employed on the artificial control surface s c besides sommerfeld radiation condition 8 is imposed at infinite 2 2 2 boundary conditions for inner domain the inner radiation and diffraction velocity potentials ϕ j i n n e r satisfy the following boundary conditions eqs 9 11 9 i ω e u x 2 ϕ j i n n e r g ϕ j i n n e r z i φ s ϕ j i n n

from the outer domain a more complex free surface condition 9 newman 1979 which considers the effects of the steady flow is used in the inner domain so as to obtain more accurate results it can be found that if the steady disturbance potential φ s in eq 9 is neglected it will reduce to the uniform flow linearization free surface condition eq 6 the steady potential φ s included in the free surface condition 9 and the m j term 12 can be separated into two components double body flow potential and steady wave flow potential compared with the double body potential the contributions of the latter component are of secondary order van t veer 1998 so in the solution of the unsteady problem the latter component is normally ignored for the sake of simplicity nakos and sclavounos 1991 kim and kim 2010 yasuda et al 2016 in this case the steady potential can be obtained by solving the following boundary value problem 13 2 φ s 0 i n t h e f l u i d d o m a i n φ s z 0 o n s f i n n e r φ s n i n n e r u n 1 i n n e r o n s b lim r φ s 0 3 numerical solution of the unsteady velocity potential since the above radiation and diffraction potentials satisfy the laplace s equation 5 they can be solved numerically through the boundary element method in this section based on the green s second identity boundary integral equations using translating pulsating green s function and rankine source will be constructed for the outer and inner domains respectively and by imposing the continuous conditions on the control surface a coupled equation system is formed to solve the unsteady velocity potentials 3 1 outer integral equation in the outer domain the neumann kelvin linearization free surface condition 6 is adopted so we can use the translating and pulsating green s function g p q to establish the boundary integral equation bie 14 c p ϕ j o u t e r p 1 4 π s c g p q ϕ j o u t e r q n q o u t e r ϕ j o u t e r q g p q n q o u t e r d s q 1 4 π g w l 2 u i ω e ϕ j o u t e r q g p q

control surface and the undisturbed free surface it should be noted that because the translating pulsating green s function automatically satisfies the free surface and radiation conditions the singularities are not needed to be distributed on the free surface and no extra numerical technique needs to be taken to satisfy the radiation condition if the control surface is divided into n c panels with n w waterline segments the integral equation can be rewritten in a discrete form 15 4 π c p i ϕ j o u t e r p i e 1 n c ϕ j o u t e r q e δ s e g n q o u t e r d s q ϕ j o u t e r q e n q

heaviside step functions xu and dong 2011 according to the above expressions the translating pulsating green s function is decomposed into a rankine part g s and a froude dependent part g f the panel integral of the rankine part can easily be calculated through the analytical formulas proposed by hess and smith 1964 the main difficulty lies in the evaluation of the panel integral of the froude dependent part in this paper a semi analytical scheme is adopted to calculate the panel integrals of g f and its normal derivative we first divide the panel by a series of horizontal segments see fig 3 for the integrals of g f and its partial derivatives on any horizontal segment l k analytical expressions can be derived and expressed as 17a i g f l k m n 1 2 0 π 1 m 1 c τ f m n θ d θ 17b i g x f

horizontal segments used to discretize the panel and a i is the corresponding weight coefficient gaussian coefficient the previous research work hong et al 2016a of our team has demonstrated that both the accuracy and efficiency of the numerical calculations are improved significantly by using this semi analytical method 3 2 inner integral equation to solve the velocity potential in the inner domain rankine source is taken as the kernel function and a boundary integral equation is established over the entire inner boundaries which include artificial control surface s c body surface s b and

more efficient and accurate than the constant panel method liu et al 1991 zhang et al 2008 chen et al 2017 yang et al 2019 so for the integral equation 20 in the inner domain we will use the hobem to solve it in this method the 9 node bi quadratic curvilinear element shown in fig 4 a is chosen to discretize the boundaries by the isoparametric transformation the 3d curvilinear element is mapped into a 2d parametric plane s t see fig 4 b and the position coordinate velocity potential and its normal derivative at any point of the element can be expressed by the nodal values 21 x y z k 1 9 n k

velocity potential and its normal derivative substituting eq 21 into eq 20 we can obtain the following discrete boundary integral equation 22 4 π c p i ϕ j i n n e r p i e 1 n c ϕ j i n n e r q e δ s

of panels in body surface and free surface respectively compared with the translating pulsating green s function the rankine source is easy to calculate so in this section the influence coefficients related to g r in eq 22 are evaluated directly by gauss legendre quadrature the keys for constructing the discrete bie 22 are the evaluations of m j term in the body surface and the second order spacial derivatives in the free surface according to eq 12 the m j term is associated with the gradient and double gradient of the steady potential by using the source distribution method the steady flow source strength σ on the ship hull can be solved by 23 φ s n 1 2 σ p 1 4 π s b σ q n g r g r 1 d s q where g r 1 1 r 1 so the gradient of the steady potential can be computed using the obtained source strength 24 φ s 1 4 π s b σ q g r g r 1 d s q as for the double gradient of the steady potential the method developed by wu 1991 is adopted for the calculation in this method complementary source strengths σ 1 σ 2 and σ 3 are defined for the first derivatives of steady potential φ s x φ s y and φ s z respectively they are evaluated by the following integral equations 25 1 4 π s b σ 1 q

1 d s q by substituting eqs 24 and 26 into eq 12 the m j term on the body surface can be evaluated numerical treatment of second order spacial derivatives in the free surface is another key issue in constructing the discrete bie 22 to obtain stable numerical results second order one side upwind difference scheme is employed to evaluate the second order derivatives in this paper 27a 2 φ x 2 i c i

discretizing the bies in outer and inner domains we can formulate a coupled equation system by imposing the continuous condition 7 or 11 on the control surface by solving this set of equations the unsteady velocity potentials on the body surface free surface and control surface can be obtained 4 hydrodynamic forces motions and added resistance in waves when the velocity potential is solved we are able to calculate the hydrodynamic forces motion responses and added resistance if we regard the ship as a rigid floating body with six degrees of freedom the motion equation can be derived by using the theorem of motion of center of mass and the theorem of moment of momentum about center of mass 28 f i j 1 6 m i j ξ j t where m ij is the inertia matrix ξ j t re x j e i ω e t is the wave induce motion in the j th mode and f i is the external force i 1 2 3 or moment i 4 5 6 f i can usually be decomposed into the following parts 29 f r o u d e k r y l o v f o r c e f i f k re ρ i ω 0 s

denote the added mass damping and hydrostatic restoring force coefficients respectively λ e i j υ is the equivalent viscous damping coefficient and δ i j denotes the kronecker delta it should be noted that the viscous force 33 is mainly caused by the roll motion which does not need to be considered in the calculations for head or following waves by substituting the expressions 29 33 into the left

responses and velocity potentials the added resistance on the ship can then be evaluated generally available methods for calculating the added resistance can be classified into near field method joncquez 2009 peng and qiu 2014 and far field method maruo 1957 gerritsma and beukelman 1972 salvesen 1974 in the near field method the added resistance is calculated by integrating second order pressure on the wetted body surface directly an advantage of this method is that the components of the second order force can be analyzed in detail but due to the great dependence on the accurate calculation of the velocity potential and its partial derivatives the near field method usually produces erroneous results for ships with flare so relatively speaking the far field method is more preferred in practice since the pioneering work of maruo 1957 many different far field methods have been proposed by the researchers in the early stage most of them are based on strip theory maruo 1957 gerritsma and beukelman 1972 salvesen 1974 which is considered to be not applicable for full form vessels at low frequencies and high speeds recently with the development of 3d potential flow theories far field formulas incorporated with 3d frequency domain and time domain boundary element methods are used more frequently in the calculation of added resistance fang and chen 2006 liu et al 2011 seo et al 2013 hong et al 2016b shigunov et al 2018 the added assistance of ships advancing in waves could be divided into two components 35 r a w total r a w m r a w d where r a w m and r a w d denote the added resistance due to ship motion and wave reflection i e diffraction effect respectively the expression of r a w m can be derived based on the energy conservation principle gerritsma and beukelman 1972 hong et al 2016b e r a w m λ i e radiated energy of the oscillating ship during one period of encounter is equal to the work done by the added resistance in head waves λ represents the incident wave length but in oblique waves due to the wave direction is not parallel to sailing direction the incident wave length should be replaced by the equivalent wave length λ cosβ referring to the formula proposed by hong et al 2016b the following expression for r a w m in oblique waves can be obtained 36 r a w r i j 6 ω e ω 0 2 2 g ω e μ i j x i r x j i x i i x j r λ i j x i r x j r x i i x j i cos β where x ir and x ii are real part and imagine part of x i respectively to consider the effect of wave elevation around ship hull the heave motion x 3 in eq 36 is corrected according to g b s radiation energy method gerritsma and beukelman 1972 hong et al 2016b 37 x 3 e i ω e t x 3 e i ω e t ξ c g x 3 e i ω e t a e i k x c g cos β y c g sin β e k e t e i ω e t where x cg and y cg denote x and y coordinates of the center of gravity of the ship respectively t represents average draft of the ship hong et al 2016b as for the diffraction added resistance r a w d the formula developed by salvesen 1974 is employed 38 r a w d re i 2 ρ k cos β s b ϕ 7 ϕ 0 n ϕ 0 n ϕ 0 d s where ϕ 0 denotes the complex conjugate of the incident wave potential the far field formula 35 can work well in long wavelength range but in short waves because the nonlinear effects play an important role it will be difficult to obtain accurate results by using the above method many researches have been carried out to overcome this difficulty for instance based on the drifting force formula of a vertical cylinder fujii and takahashi 1975 proposed a semi empirical formula of added resistance in short waves faltinsen et al 1980 derived an asymptotic formula by assuming the incident waves are perfectly reflected from the non shadowed part of the ship these methods yield good results for relatively blunt bodies but when it comes to fine hulls added resistance obtained from these methods does not show satisfactory agreement with the experimental data in order to overcome this drawback the national

the following formula proposed by liu and papanikolaou 2016 is employed in this paper 40 r a w r a w total r a w d r aw s e m i e m p i r i c a l 5 numerical results and analysis 5 1 convergence of hybrid hobem based on the above hybrid higher order boundary element method hobem a computer code is developed and used for the hydrodynamic calculations to confirm the convergence and reliability of the developed code we conduct a numerical experiment on a modified wigley hull the modified wigley is a mathematical ship hull with length l 2m breadth b 0 3m and draft d 0 125m whose expression can be seen in the reference kashiwagi 2013 fig 5 shows a typical computational domain and panel arrangement for the modified wigley the convergence with respect to the computational domain size and mesh number is studied through the forced oscillation tests of the modified wigley hull in the convergence study the forward speed fn 0 2 and the wavelength to ship length ratio λ l 1 2 in head waves are considered by using different computational domain sizes and mesh numbers the heave hydrodynamic coefficients are calculated and plotted in figs 6 and 7 fig 6 shows the model sensitivity to the free surface size and the mesh number in the free surface the abscissas n λ e represents the number of panels within an encounter wave length four different free surface sizes i e the control surface is at 0 5λ e 0 75λ e 1 0λ e and 2 0λ e from the ship are considered in the calculation it can be obviously observed that both the added mass and damping coefficient will converge to a stable value when the number of panels per encounter wavelength is more than 12 i e 25 nodes different convergent values are obtained by using different free surface sizes but if the location of the control surface is beyond 0 75λ e from the ship the difference of them will be very small the convergence with respect to the depth d c of the control surface and mesh number n d c in the vertical direction are illustrated in fig 7 similar to the results shown in fig 6 the hydrodynamic coefficients plotted in fig 7 are also found to be convergent if more than 5 panels are distributed in the vertical direction of the control surface and the convergent numerical results are almost the same when the depth of the control surface is greater than 0 5λ e the above analysis indicates that convergent numerical results can be obtained in a relatively small computational domain whose control surface is 0 75λ e from the ship and 0 5λ e in the depth direction discretized by about 12 panels i e 25 nodes per encounter wavelength in the free surface and 5 panels in the vertical direction of the control surface by adopting this computational domain and the corresponding grid size the hydrodynamic forces on the modified wigley at different frequencies are calculated the hydrodynamic coefficients and wave exciting forces are plotted in figs 8 and 9 respectively besides the present computed results the experimental data of kashiwagi et al 2000 and wakabayashi 2012 are also included in these figures for comparison it can be observed that by using the above mentioned computational domain and grid size the present hybrid method can produce satisfactory prediction of the hydrodynamic forces in the whole frequency range 5 2 ship motions in this section the hybrid hobem is applied to predict the ship motion responses in regular head and oblique waves besides the above modified wigley hull the s175 kcs and a bulk carrier s cb84 will also be studied in the following simulations the well known s175 is an ittc standard ship with flare at the ends which has been tested by several institutions the kcs is a container ship designed by kriso which is a popular test model as many experimental data are open to the public and the s cb84 with block coefficient c b 0 84 is a modified version of kvlcc2 whose body plan can be seen in yasukawa et al 2015 the geometry of the three ships is shown in fig 10 and the principal particulars are listed in table 1 5 2 1 case of head wave motion simulations for the modified wigley at fn 0 2 in head waves are first performed the results of wave induced motions in surge heave and pitch are shown in fig 11 for comparison computed results by three dimensional translating pulsating 3dtp green s function method based on gauss quadrature hong et al 2016a and frequency domain rankine panel method rpm using double body linearization kashiwagi 2013 are also included in these figures it can be seen that the computed results of the present hybrid hobem show good agreement with the experimental data for both the surge and vertical i e heave and pitch motions the rpm can work well in the prediction of vertical motions but when it comes to the motion response in surge results of the rpm show a significant difference with those of the other two methods the unreasonable results with bad accuracy of the rpm is possibly because of the difficulty in satisfying the radiation condition numerically by using the rankine source in frequency domain yasuda et al 2016 as for the 3dtp the tendency of the motions is similar to that of the present hybrid hobem but perhaps because the steady flow effects are not considered in the 3dtp it gives a slightly greater magnitude of pitch motion than the measured data near the peak value frequency besides for the surge motion the 3dtp appears to underestimate the peak value near λ l 1 0 and overestimate the value in the long wave range some numerical calculations are also carried out for the s175 container ship advancing in head waves fig 12 shows the comparison of numerically predicted motion responses with experimental data ittc seakeeping committee 1978 at fn 0 275 results of four different numerical methods the present hybrid hobem the 3dtp based on gauss quadrature hong et al 2016a the time domain rpm using neumann kelvin linearization and double body linearization kim and kim 2010 are presented in this figure it can be observed that stable numerical results are obtained by the present hybrid hobem and the two rpms and the results of the three methods show that the steady flow has a noticeable influence on the motion responses as seen in fig 12 a the rpm with neumann kelvin linearization overestimate the heave motion responses in the peak value region while the results of present hybrid hobem and the rpm with double body linearization show better agreement with experiment data generally when the steady flow effects are considered both the hybrid hobem and rpm can improve the results of motion responses but compared with the rpm the size of the boundary element region of the hybrid hobem is reduced dramatically as mentioned in section 5 1 which will consequently make the present method more efficient different from the above three methods highly oscillating phenomenon is observed in the results of the 3dtp this is mainly due to the flare in the stern of s175 see fig 10 a where the translating pulsating green s function is highly oscillatory chen 2000 and stable panel integrals of it are hard to be obtained to investigate the influence of forward speed on the motion responses the heave and pitch motions of s175 and kcs at different speeds are calculated by the present hybrid hobem figs 13 and 14 illustrate the computed and experimental results of s175 ittc seakeeping committee 1978 ittc seakeeping committee 1987 fonseca and guedes soares 2004 and kcs simonsen et al 2013 respectively as shown in these figures the predicted motion responses of the present hybrid hobem agree well with the experimental data at different speeds on the whole both the heave and pitch motions display a dependence on the forward speed of the ship with the increase of speed the maximum values of the motions will increase and occur in longer waves the above results show that the present hybrid hobem has good stability and accuracy in the hydrodynamic calculations of both wall sided modified wigley and non wall sided s175 ships but both of them are slender to see whether the hybrid hobem still applies to more full formed ships we also conduct a motion simulation on a bulk carrier s cb84 with block coefficient c b 0 84 fig 15 shows the heave and pitch motions at 8 knot fn 0 099 and 13 5 knot fn 0 166 similar to the results of s175 and kcs shown in figs 13 and 14 the motion responses of the s cb84 are also found to exhibit a dependence on the forward speed and the numerical results are of satisfactory accuracy as compared with the experimental data yasukawa et al 2018 5 2 2 case of oblique wave for the above simulations of ship motions in head waves where only the surge heave and pitch motions arise the viscous damping is very small and can be disregarded however when it comes to ships advancing in oblique waves six degree motion responses could occur simultaneously in this case the potential flow theory will over predict the roll motion if no correction is made to the roll damping therefore an additional viscous roll damping coefficient λ e 44 υ is introduced into the motion equation 34 in the following simulations in oblique waves wave induced motions of s175 at fn 0 275 in bow oblique waves β 1200 and 1500 are computed and shown in fig 16 in the calculations the roll damping coefficient obtained from the numerical free roll decay test chen et al 2018b is used for comparison numerical results in head waves which have been studied in the above section are also included in the figures it can be seen that the agreement between the calculated motion responses and available experimental data ittc seakeeping committee 1978 in oblique waves is satisfactory compared with the results in head waves motion responses in oblique waves seem to have the similar tendency of changes with the incident wavelength but with the decrease of heading angle the resonant wavelengths where the motions take a peak will shift to the shorter wavelength side for the heave motion the difference between the peak values in oblique and head waves is very small however when it comes to the pitch motion we can find that the maximum motion response in head wave is obviously larger than that in oblique waves fig 17 shows the motion responses of s cb84 at 8 knot with different headings i e β 300 1500 and 900 the roll damping coefficient measured by yasukawa et al 2018 is adopted in the numerical simulation as shown in the figures the present hybrid hobem can capture well the trend of motion responses of s cb84 at difference heading angles overall the predicted motions are in good agreement with the measured data yasukawa et al 2018 by comparing the results of different heading angles we can find that for the sway and roll motion responses the motion amplitudes in beam waves β 900 are much larger than that in oblique waves β 300 and 1500 for all of hull forms considered the above numerical simulations and analysis show that the present hybrid hobem can achieve satisfactory results of motion responses with different speeds and heading angles compared with the translating pulsating green s function method the hybrid method can obtain more stable numerical results for the non wall sided ship besides since the local steady flow is considered in the free surface and body surface conditions the present method appears to be more accurate than the 3dtp and rpm using neumann kelvin linearization 5 3 added resistance in head and oblique waves after knowledge of ship motion responses and hydrodynamic characteristics added assistance can then be calculated the computed and experimental results fujii and takahashi 1975 nakamura and naito 1977 of added resistances on s175 at fn 0 25 in head waves are shown in fig 18 it can be observed that the present numerical results agree fairly well with the measured data for comparison added resistances computed by strip method rpm seo et al 2013 and 3dtp based on a semi analytical scheme hong et al 2016b incorporated with far field formulation are also included in the figure overall results of the different numerical methods are similar to each other and the agreement between the computed results and experimental data is satisfactory however some differences among computed results are shown especially in short waves and peak value frequency in strip method the magnitudes of added resistances in short waves are underestimated while the peak value is overestimated in rpm and 3dtp the calculation precision is satisfactory at most frequencies but near the peak value frequency they give a slightly smaller magnitude of added resistance than the experimental data the added resistance of kcs is also calculated by the present hybrid hobem fig 19 shows the computed and experimental results simonsen et al 2013 of added resistance at fn 0 26 for comparison numerical results of 3dtp hong et al 2016b and aegir joncquez 2009 which is a time domain rankine source code are also included in this figure it can be seen that the agreement between the present numerical results and the experimental data is satisfactory and similar to the results shown in fig 18 the added resistances calculated by the present hybrid hobem seems to be more close to the measured data especially near the short wave length and peak value frequency in order to investigate the influence of forward speed and incident wave angle on the added resistance further numerical calculations are conducted on s175 with different speeds and headings fig 20 shows the added resistances for s175 at fn 0 15 0 20 0 25 and 0 30 in head waves it can be seen that a quite satisfactory agreement between numerical and experimental results is achieved for all the speeds considered the added resistance display an evident dependence on the forward speed with the increase of speed the added resistance increases considerably and the peak value frequency moves into the longer wave range this is similar to the results of motion responses shown in fig 13 the influence of the incident wave angle on the added resistance can be seen in fig 21 which illustrates the added resistance on s175 at fn 0 25 for three different headings i e β 1200 1500 and 1800 the good agreement between the numerical and experimental results indicates that the present method can work well in predicting the added resistances in both head and oblique waves from fig 21 it can be found that the heading angles appear to have a significant influence on the added resistance the wave length of the maximum added resistance increases with increased heading angle for the values of the maximum added resistances at different heading angles an interesting phenomenon is observed the maximum added resistance in head waves β 1800 is much larger than that at β 1200 but almost the same as that at β 1500 this is probably because of the additional attribution due to sway roll and yaw motions in oblique waves salvesen 1974 the added resistances of s cb84 in head and oblique waves are also calculated by the present hybrid hobem the comparison between the numerical and experimental results yasukawa et al 2018 is shown in fig 22 overall the present method capture well the tendency of added resistances at 13kn in head waves β 1800 and 8kn in oblique waves β 1500 compared with the results of skfm strip theory based kochin function method yasukawa et al 2018 the present calculations are closer to the experimental data especially for the short wavelength region from a practical application perspective the present method can predict the added resistance on s cb84 with satisfactory accuracy 6 conclusions in this paper a frequency domain hybrid higher order boundary element

developed for the hydrodynamic calculations to investigate the convergence of this code the hydrodynamic forces on a mathematical ship model modified wigley hull are calculated numerical results show that the present method has good mesh convergence and the computational domain can be limited to a relatively small region to improve the calculation efficiency after the convergence study the developed code is applied in the computations of motions and added resistance for ships advancing in waves wave induced motions of two slender ships with and without flare i e s175 and modified wigley in head waves are first evaluated the computed results are compared against the available experimental data and other numerical solutions of the rankine panel method and translating pulsating green s

stable for the non wall sided ship s175 then the motion responses and added resistance at various forward speeds and heading angles are investigated besides the s175 a newer container ship kcs and a bulk carrier s cb84 with block coefficient c b 0 84 are also considered in the calculations the motions and added resistance are found to display a similar dependence on the forward speed and heading angle and through the comparison between the numerical and experimental results it is confirmed that for both the slender and full formed ships the present hybrid hobem is able to produce satisfactory predictions at different speeds and heading angles declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

reliable estimation of ship hydrodynamics such as wave loads motion responses and added resistance is of crucial importance for both the design and operation of ship structures over the past few decades numerous studies have been devoted to the development of numerical methods for the hydrodynamic calculations of ships in waves the wave body interactions at zero speed can now be predicted with satisfactory accuracy but when it comes to the forward speed case the current hydrodynamic computations are still far from a mature engineering science the numerical study on hydrodynamic responses of ships with forward speed in waves may start from the middle twentieth century when the strip theory was first proposed by korvin kroukovsky 1955 after that various forms of strip theory based methods were developed these strip methods are fast and can to a certain extent produce satisfactory results for some conditions so even today they are still widely used as an engineering tool for the ship hydrodynamic calculations however the strip theory is a two dimensional 2d theory there are some inherent deficiencies in the application of a 2d method to a three dimensional 3d problem it has been shown in the published literature that the strip theory is mainly limited to the slender ships with low speed and high frequency situation to overcome these limitations fully 3d methods were gradually developed in recent years since the pioneering work of hess and smith 1964 the 3d panel method or boundary element method bem based on potential flow theory has gained the most popularity the original panel method employs a simple rankine source as the kernel in the boundary integral equation bie the main advantages of the rankine panel method rpm are that the rankine source is easy to calculate and it allows a flexible choice of the free surface conditions so far many efforts have been devoted to study and apply the rpm in the unsteady ship hydrodynamics problem nakos and sclavounos 1991 kim and kim 2010 he and kashiwagi 2014 chen et al 2018a but there still remain some limitations for the extensive use of it for example because the rankine source does not satisfy the free surface condition we need to distribute singularities not only on the ship hull but also on the free surface which will consequently increase the computation cost in addition for ships in infinite fluid domain the free surface has to be truncated so as to obtain a finite region for the numerical implementation this will bring truncation errors and make the radiation condition hard to be satisfied especially when the brard number τ τ uω e g is less than 0 25 yasuda et al 2016 besides the above mentioned rankine panel method another alternative 3d panel method that can be used for the hydrodynamic analysis of ships advancing in waves is the free surface green s function method in this method the green s function automatically satisfying the neumann kelvin or uniform flow linearization free surface condition and radiation condition is used so the singularities are only required to be distributed on the mean wetted body surface the key of this method is the evaluation of the green s function it is in the 1940s that the first mathematical formulation for the free surface green s function was derived haskind 1946 the original formulation is in a double fourier integral form which is complex and not suitable for numerical computation in view of this the researchers devoted a lot of effort to simplifying it and derived various single integral forms of the green s function havelock 1958 bessho 1977 wu and eatock taylor 1987 based on these single integral forms some efficient computational algorithms maury et al 2003 yao and dong 2014 hong et al 2016a were developed recently which makes it possible to use the free surface green s function method to solve the hydrodynamic problems of ships with forward speed compared with the rpm the free surface green s function method has advantages in that it does not require the free surface mesh and can guarantee the radiation condition for any brard number however due to the highly oscillatory of the green s function near the free surface chen 2000 numerical instability usually arises in the implementation of this method especially for ships with large flare in view of the limitations of using only one of the above two 3d panel methods a hybrid method combining both rankine source and free surface green s function was developed recently this method introduces an artificial control surface to decompose the fluid domain into two subdomains in the outer domain the free surface green s function is adopted while the rankine source is applied in the inner domain by using the hybrid method both the advantages of the rankine panel method and free surface green s function method can be exploited the idea of combination of different methods has already appeared in the research as early as 1970s yeung 1975 but it was not applied to ship hydrodynamic problems until the late 1990s when a 3d time domain hybrid boundary element method by combining rankine source and transient green s function is developed by the scholars duan and dai 1997 zhang et al 1998 to solve the hydrodynamic problems of non wall sided ships after that the research works of liu and papanikolaou 2011 tang et al 2014 and chen et al 2018b made further contributions to the development of the hybrid method in time domain however when it comes to the frequency domain hybrid method very little relevant work has been done so far and much of the work is of theoretical ten and chen 2010 or about the zero speed problem liang and chen 2017 as we know the hydrodynamic responses in frequency domain are generally the solutions to be preferred for the use in the design of ship structures kim 2005 compared to the frequency domain method liu et al 1991 li et al 2012 hong et al 2016a the time domain algorithm he and kashiwagi 2014 chen et al 2018a li et al 2019 is usually too time consuming to obtain the target solution so it is of great significance to study the hybrid method in frequency for the ship hydrodynamic problems with forward speed motivated by this a frequency domain hybrid higher order boundary element method hobem is developed in the present paper in this method a wall sided control surface in cuboid form is employed to divide the infinite fluid domain into an outer domain and an inner domain with the presence of floating bodies and within the framework of potential flow theory in frequency domain boundary integral equations using different green s functions are constructed in the two domains respectively the translating pulsating green s function is applied in the bie of outer domain since it satisfies the free surface and radiation conditions automatically the singularities are only needed to be distributed on the control surface by dividing the control surface into a series of panels a discrete bie is obtained for the outer domain in this discrete bie the panel integrals of the green s function are evaluated by a semi analytical scheme as for the bie in the inner domain the rankine source is used as the kernel function the sources are distributed on the entire inner boundaries including the inner free surface body surface and control surface and the steady flow effects are considered in the free surface and body surface conditions the inner bie is discretized and solved by the hobem which has been verified to be more accurate and efficient than the conventional constant panel method cpm in the previous studies liu et al 1991 zhang et al 2008 chen et al 2017 yang et al 2019 since the rankine source is easy to calculate the influence coefficients of the inner bie are evaluated directly by gauss legendre quadrature by combining the discrete bies in outer and inner domains we obtain a coupled linear equation system for the velocity potentials on the boundaries based on this hybrid hobem the hydrodynamic coefficients and wave exciting forces on a mathematical ship model modified wigley are computed and the numerical results indicate that the present method is of good convergence and accuracy the hybrid hobem is applied to the hydrodynamic calculations of ships advancing in waves motion responses of the modified wigley at fn 0 2 and the s175 containership at fn 0 275 in head waves are first calculated for comparison the experimental data and numerical results of the rankine panel method and translating pulsating green s function method are also shown in this paper the present hybrid hobem appears to have better stability and accuracy than the other numerical methods then numerical simulations are conducted on the s175 a newer container ship kcs and a more full formed ship s cb84 at various forward speeds the motion responses and added resistance in both head and oblique waves are calculated and analyzed the good agreement between the computed and experimental results indicates that the present hybrid hobem can produce satisfactory predictions for different ship types with different forward speeds and heading angles 2 mathematical model 2 1 problem description consider the problem of a ship advancing with the constant mean forward speed u in an oblique regular wave field of infinite depth to solve this problem a right handed cartesian coordinate system o xyz moving together with the ship is introduced see fig 1 the oxy plane is set on the undisturbed free surface with the x axis pointing opposite to the direction of forward motion the z axis points upward and crosses the gravity center of the ship the regular incident wave propagates in the direction with an angle β relative to the x axis the potential theory is adopted for the present ship motion analysis under the assumption of ideal and incompressible fluid with irrotational motion the velocity potential φ x y z t which satisfies the laplace s equation can be introduced to describe the fluid motion we decompose the potential φ into a steady and an unsteady parts 1 φ x y z t φ s x y z φ u x y z t where φ s is the time independent potential due to the steady forward motion of the ship φ u is the unsteady potential associated with the incident wave and ship s oscillatory motions by assuming the unsteady motions to be time harmonic in the linear theory the unsteady potential can be written in the form as follows 2 φ u x y z t re ϕ u x y z e i ω e t 3 ϕ u x y z ϕ 0 ϕ 7 j 1 6 i ω e x j ϕ j where ϕ u is the spatial part of the unsteady potential it is separated into the incident potential ϕ 0 the diffraction potential ϕ 7 and the radiation potential ϕ j j 1 2 6 due to the unit oscillation of the ship in the j th mode j 1 2 6 for surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw respectively x j denotes the complex amplitude of the oscillation in the j th mode ω e is the encounter frequency according to the linear wave theory the incident potential in deep water can be expressed as 4 ϕ 0 x y z a g i ω 0 e k z i k x cos β y sin β where ω 0 is the natural frequency k is the wave number a is the wave amplitude and g is the gravitational acceleration so for the unsteady problem the key point lies in the computation of the radiation and diffraction potentials ϕ j j 1 2 7 satisfying the laplace s equation in the fluid domain 5 2 ϕ j 0 2 2 flow field decomposition and boundary conditions in the present computation we introduce a wall sided control surface s c in cuboid form to divide the flow field into an outer domain and an inner domain see fig 2 the outer domain is bounded by s c the outer free surface s f o u t e r and the radiation boundary s at infinite while the boundaries of the inner domain include s c the mean wetted body surface s b and the inner free surface s f i n n e r in both outer and inner domains the velocity potential ϕ j is governed by the laplace s equation 5 2 2 1 boundary conditions for outer domain for the radiation and diffraction potentials ϕ j o u t e r in the outer domain the boundary conditions on the free surface s f o u t e r control surface s c and radiation boundary s

surface i e n o u t e r n i n n e r on s c the uniform flow or neumann kelvin linearization free surface condition 6 is adopted on s f o u t e r so we can use the translating pulsating green s function which automatically satisfies the free surface and radiation conditions and the singularities are only needed to be distributed on the control surface to ensure the continuity of the velocity potential and its normal derivative the boundary condition 7 is employed on the artificial control surface s c besides sommerfeld radiation condition 8 is imposed at infinite 2 2 2 boundary conditions for inner domain the inner radiation and diffraction velocity potentials ϕ j i n n e r satisfy the following boundary conditions eqs 9 11 9 i ω e u x 2 ϕ j i n n e r g ϕ j i n n e r z i φ s ϕ j i n n

from the outer domain a more complex free surface condition 9 newman 1979 which considers the effects of the steady flow is used in the inner domain so as to obtain more accurate results it can be found that if the steady disturbance potential φ s in eq 9 is neglected it will reduce to the uniform flow linearization free surface condition eq 6 the steady potential φ s included in the free surface condition 9 and the m j term 12 can be separated into two components double body flow potential and steady wave flow potential compared with the double body potential the contributions of the latter component are of secondary order van t veer 1998 so in the solution of the unsteady problem the latter component is normally ignored for the sake of simplicity nakos and sclavounos 1991 kim and kim 2010 yasuda et al 2016 in this case the steady potential can be obtained by solving the following boundary value problem 13 2 φ s 0 i n t h e f l u i d d o m a i n φ s z 0 o n s f i n n e r φ s n

solved numerically through the boundary element method in this section based on the green s second identity boundary integral equations using translating pulsating green s function and rankine source will be constructed for the outer and inner domains respectively and by imposing the continuous conditions on the control surface a coupled equation system is formed to solve the unsteady velocity potentials 3 1 outer integral equation in the outer domain the neumann kelvin linearization free surface condition 6 is adopted so we can use the translating and pulsating green s function g p q to establish the boundary integral equation bie 14 c p ϕ j o u t e r p 1 4 π s c g p q ϕ j o u t e r q n q o u t e r ϕ j o u t e r q g p q n q o u t e r d s q 1 4 π g w l 2 u i ω e ϕ j o u t e r q g p q

control surface and the undisturbed free surface it should be noted that because the translating pulsating green s function automatically satisfies the free surface and radiation conditions the singularities are not needed to be distributed on the free surface and no extra numerical technique needs to be taken to satisfy the radiation condition if the control surface is divided into n c panels with n w waterline segments the integral equation can be rewritten in a discrete form 15 4 π c p i ϕ j o u t e r p i e 1 n c ϕ j o u t e r q e δ s e g n q o u t e r d s q ϕ j o u t e r q e n q

heaviside step functions xu and dong 2011 according to the above expressions the translating pulsating green s function is decomposed into a rankine part g s and a froude dependent part g f the panel integral of the rankine part can easily be calculated through the analytical formulas proposed by hess and smith 1964 the main difficulty lies in the evaluation of the panel integral of the froude dependent part in this paper a semi analytical scheme is adopted to calculate the panel integrals of g f and its normal derivative we first divide the panel by a series of horizontal segments see fig

horizontal segments used to discretize the panel and a i is the corresponding weight coefficient gaussian coefficient the previous research work hong et al 2016a of our team has demonstrated that both the accuracy and efficiency of the numerical calculations are improved significantly by using this semi analytical method 3 2 inner integral equation to solve the velocity potential in the inner

more efficient and accurate than the constant panel method liu et al 1991 zhang et al 2008 chen et al 2017 yang et al 2019 so for the integral equation 20 in the inner domain we will use the hobem to solve it in this method the 9 node bi quadratic curvilinear element shown in fig 4 a is chosen to discretize the boundaries by the isoparametric transformation the 3d curvilinear element is mapped into a 2d parametric plane s t see fig 4 b and the position coordinate velocity potential and its normal derivative at any point of the element can be expressed by the nodal values 21 x y z k 1 9 n k

velocity potential and its normal derivative substituting eq 21 into eq 20 we can obtain the following discrete boundary integral equation 22 4 π c p i ϕ j i n n e r p i e 1 n c ϕ j i n n e r q e δ s

of panels in body surface and free surface respectively compared with the translating pulsating green s function the rankine source is easy to calculate so in this section the influence coefficients related to g r in eq 22 are evaluated directly by gauss legendre quadrature the keys for constructing the discrete bie 22 are the evaluations of m j term in the body surface and the second order spacial derivatives in the free surface according to eq 12 the m j term is associated with the gradient and double gradient of the steady potential by using the source distribution method the steady flow source strength σ on the ship hull can be solved by 23 φ s n 1 2 σ p 1 4 π s b σ q n g r g r 1 d s q where g r 1 1 r 1 so the gradient of the steady potential can be computed using the obtained source strength 24 φ s 1 4 π s b σ q g r g r 1 d s q as for the double gradient of the steady potential the method developed by wu 1991 is adopted for the calculation in this method complementary source strengths σ 1 σ 2 and σ 3 are defined for the first derivatives of steady potential φ s x φ s y and φ s z respectively they are evaluated by the following integral equations 25 1 4 π s b σ 1 q g r g r 1 σ 2 q g r g r 1 σ 3 q g r g r 1 d s q φ s x φ s y φ s z after obtaining σ 1 σ 2 and σ 3 we can calculate the double gradient by 26 φ s 1 4 π s b σ 1 q g r g r 1 σ 2 q g r g r 1 σ 3 q g r g r 1 d s q by substituting eqs 24 and 26 into eq 12 the m j term on the body surface can be evaluated numerical treatment of second order spacial derivatives in the free surface is another key issue in constructing the discrete bie 22 to obtain stable numerical results second order one side upwind difference scheme is employed to evaluate the second order derivatives in this paper 27a 2 φ x 2 i c i

2 x i 1 x i 2 x i 3 c 4 4 x i 2 x i 1 x i 2 x i 3 x i x i 3 x i 1 x i 3 x i 2 where x i represents the coordinate of the i th node and φ i is the corresponding physical variable after having discretizing the bies in outer and inner domains we can formulate a coupled equation system by imposing the continuous condition 7 or 11 on the control surface by solving this set of equations the unsteady velocity potentials on the body surface free surface and control surface can be obtained 4 hydrodynamic forces motions and added resistance in waves when the velocity potential is solved we are able to calculate the hydrodynamic forces motion responses and added resistance if we regard the ship as a rigid floating body with six degrees of freedom the motion equation can be derived by using the theorem of motion of center of mass and the theorem of moment of momentum about center of mass 28 f i j 1 6 m i j ξ j t where m ij is the inertia matrix ξ j t re x j e i ω e t is the wave induce motion in the j th mode and f i is the external force i 1 2 3 or moment i 4 5 6 f i can usually be decomposed into the following parts 29 f r o u d e k r y l o v f o r c e f i f k re ρ i ω 0 s

denote the added mass damping and hydrostatic restoring force coefficients respectively λ e i j υ is the equivalent viscous damping coefficient and δ i j denotes the kronecker delta it should be noted that the viscous force 33 is mainly caused by the roll motion which does not need to be considered in the calculations for head or following waves by substituting the expressions 29 33 into the left side of eq 28 we can obtain the following ship motion equation in oblique waves 34 j 1 6 ω e 2 m i j μ i j i ω e λ i j λ e i j υ δ 4 j c i j x j f i f k f i d i 1 2 6 with the solution of the motion responses and velocity potentials the added resistance on the ship can then be evaluated generally available methods for calculating the added resistance can be classified into near field method joncquez 2009 peng and qiu 2014 and far field method maruo 1957 gerritsma and beukelman 1972 salvesen 1974 in the near field method the added resistance is calculated by integrating second order pressure on the wetted body surface directly an advantage of this method is that the components of the second order force can be analyzed in detail but due to the great dependence on the accurate calculation of the velocity potential and its partial derivatives the near field method usually produces erroneous results for ships with flare so relatively speaking the far field method is more preferred in practice since the pioneering work of maruo 1957 many different far field methods have been proposed by the researchers in the early stage most of them are based on strip theory maruo 1957 gerritsma and beukelman 1972 salvesen 1974 which is considered to be not applicable for full form vessels at low frequencies and high speeds recently with the development of 3d potential flow theories far field formulas incorporated with 3d frequency domain and time domain boundary element methods are used more frequently in the calculation of added resistance fang and chen 2006 liu et al 2011 seo et al 2013 hong et al 2016b shigunov et al 2018 the added assistance of ships advancing in waves could be divided into two components 35 r a w total r a w m r a w d where r a w m and r a w d denote the added resistance due to ship motion and wave reflection i e diffraction effect respectively the expression of r a w m can be derived based on the energy conservation principle gerritsma and beukelman 1972 hong et al 2016b e r a w m λ i e radiated energy of the oscillating ship during one period of encounter is equal to the work done by the added resistance in head waves λ represents the incident wave length but in oblique waves due to the wave direction is not parallel to sailing direction the incident wave length should be replaced by the equivalent wave length λ cosβ referring to the formula proposed by hong et al 2016b the following expression for r a w m in oblique waves can be obtained 36 r a w r i j 6 ω e ω 0 2 2 g ω e μ i j x i r x j i x i i x j r λ i j x i r x j r x i i x j i cos β where x ir and x ii are real part and imagine part of x i respectively to consider the effect of wave elevation around ship hull the heave motion x 3 in eq 36 is corrected according to g b s radiation energy method gerritsma and beukelman 1972 hong et al 2016b 37 x 3 e i ω e t x 3 e i ω e t ξ c g x 3 e i ω e t a e i k x c g cos β y c g sin β e k e t e i ω e t where x cg and y cg denote x and y coordinates of the center of gravity of the ship respectively t represents average draft of the ship hong et al 2016b as for the diffraction added resistance r a w d the formula developed by salvesen 1974 is employed 38 r a w d re i 2 ρ k cos β s b ϕ 7 ϕ 0 n ϕ 0 n ϕ 0 d s where ϕ 0 denotes the complex conjugate of the incident wave potential the far field formula 35 can work well in long wavelength range but in short waves because the nonlinear effects play an important role it will be difficult to obtain accurate results by using the above method many researches have been carried out to overcome this difficulty for instance based on the drifting force formula of a vertical cylinder fujii and takahashi 1975 proposed a semi empirical formula of added resistance in short waves faltinsen et al 1980 derived an asymptotic formula by assuming the incident waves are perfectly reflected from the non shadowed part of the ship these methods yield good results for relatively blunt bodies but when it comes to fine hulls added resistance obtained from these methods does not show satisfactory agreement with the experimental data in order to overcome this drawback the national maritime research institute nmri in japan tsujimoto et al 2008 kuroda et al 2008 and liu et al 2015 proposed improved formulas based on the methods of fujii and takahashi 1975 and faltinsen et al 1980 respectively the present work will adopt the method of nmri 39 r aw s e m i e m p i r i c a l 1 2 ρ g a 2 α d 1 α u b b f β where b f β 1 b l i sin 2 χ β sin θ d l l i i sin 2 χ β sin θ d l α d π 2 i

the following formula proposed by liu and papanikolaou 2016 is employed in this paper 40 r a w r a w total r a w d r aw s e m i e m p i r i c a l 5 numerical results and analysis 5 1 convergence of hybrid hobem based on the above hybrid higher order boundary element method hobem a computer code is developed and used for the hydrodynamic calculations to confirm the convergence and reliability of the developed code we conduct a numerical experiment on a modified wigley hull the modified wigley is a mathematical ship hull with length l 2m breadth b 0 3m and draft d 0 125m whose expression can be seen in the reference kashiwagi 2013 fig 5 shows a typical computational domain and panel arrangement for the modified wigley the convergence with respect to the computational domain size and mesh number is studied through the forced oscillation tests of the modified wigley hull in the convergence study the forward speed fn 0 2 and the wavelength to ship length ratio λ l 1 2 in head waves are considered by using different computational domain sizes and mesh numbers the heave hydrodynamic coefficients are calculated and plotted in figs 6 and 7 fig 6 shows the model sensitivity to the free surface size and the mesh number in the free surface the abscissas n λ e represents the number of panels within an encounter wave length four different free surface sizes i e the control surface is at 0 5λ e 0 75λ e 1 0λ e and 2 0λ e from the ship are considered in the calculation it can be obviously observed that both the added mass and damping coefficient will converge to a stable value when the number of panels per encounter wavelength is more than 12 i e 25 nodes different convergent values are obtained by using different free surface sizes but if the location of the control surface is beyond 0 75λ e from the ship the difference of them will be very small the convergence with respect to the depth d c of the control surface and mesh number n d c in the vertical direction are illustrated in fig 7 similar to the results shown in fig 6 the hydrodynamic coefficients plotted in fig 7 are also found to be convergent if more than 5 panels are distributed in the vertical direction of the control surface and the convergent numerical results are almost the same when the depth of the control surface is greater than 0 5λ e the above analysis indicates that convergent numerical results can be obtained in a relatively small computational domain whose control surface is 0 75λ e from the ship and 0 5λ e in the depth direction discretized by about 12 panels i e 25 nodes per encounter wavelength in the free surface and 5 panels in the vertical direction of the control surface by adopting this computational domain and the corresponding grid size the hydrodynamic forces on the modified wigley at different frequencies are calculated the hydrodynamic coefficients and wave exciting forces are plotted in figs 8 and 9 respectively besides the present computed results the experimental data of kashiwagi et al 2000 and wakabayashi 2012 are also included in these figures for comparison it can be observed that by using the above mentioned computational domain and grid size the present hybrid method can produce satisfactory prediction of the hydrodynamic forces in the whole frequency range 5 2 ship motions in this section the hybrid hobem is applied to predict the ship motion responses in regular head and oblique waves besides the above modified wigley hull the s175 kcs and a bulk carrier s cb84 will also be studied in the following simulations the well known s175 is an ittc standard ship with flare at the ends which has been tested by several institutions the kcs is a container ship designed by kriso which is a popular test model as many experimental data are open to the public and the s cb84 with block coefficient c b 0 84 is a modified version of kvlcc2 whose body plan can be seen in yasukawa et al 2015 the geometry of the three ships is shown in fig 10 and the principal particulars are listed in table 1 5 2 1 case of head wave motion simulations for the modified wigley at fn 0 2 in head waves are first performed the results of wave induced motions in surge heave and pitch are shown in fig 11 for comparison computed results by three dimensional translating pulsating 3dtp green s function method based on gauss quadrature hong et al 2016a and frequency domain rankine panel method rpm using double body linearization kashiwagi 2013 are also included in these figures it can be seen that the computed results of the present hybrid hobem show good agreement with the experimental data for both the surge and vertical i e heave and pitch motions the rpm can work well in the prediction of vertical motions but when it comes to the motion response in surge results of the rpm show a significant difference with those of the other two methods the unreasonable results with bad accuracy of the rpm is possibly because of the difficulty in satisfying the radiation condition numerically by using the rankine source in frequency domain yasuda et al 2016 as for the 3dtp the tendency of the motions is similar to that of the present hybrid hobem but perhaps because the steady flow effects are not considered in the 3dtp it gives a slightly greater magnitude of pitch motion than the measured data near the peak value frequency besides for the surge motion the 3dtp appears to underestimate the peak value near λ l 1 0 and overestimate the value in the long wave range some numerical calculations are also carried out for the s175 container ship advancing in head waves fig 12 shows the comparison of numerically predicted motion responses with experimental data ittc seakeeping committee 1978 at fn 0 275 results of four different numerical methods the present hybrid hobem the 3dtp based on gauss quadrature hong et al 2016a the time domain rpm using neumann kelvin linearization and double body linearization kim and kim 2010 are presented in this figure it can be observed that stable numerical results are obtained by the present hybrid hobem and the two rpms and the results of the three methods show that the steady flow has a noticeable influence on the motion responses as seen in fig 12 a the rpm with neumann kelvin linearization overestimate the heave motion responses in the peak value region while the results of present hybrid hobem and the rpm with double body linearization show better agreement with experiment data generally when the steady flow effects are considered both the hybrid hobem and rpm can improve the results of motion responses but compared with the rpm the size of the boundary element region of the hybrid hobem is reduced dramatically as mentioned in section 5 1 which will consequently make the present method more efficient different from the above three methods highly oscillating phenomenon is observed in the results of the 3dtp this is mainly due to the flare in the stern of s175 see fig 10 a where the translating pulsating green s function is highly oscillatory chen 2000 and stable panel integrals of it are hard to be obtained to investigate the influence of forward speed on the motion responses the heave and pitch motions of s175 and kcs at different speeds are calculated by the present hybrid hobem figs 13 and 14 illustrate the computed and experimental results of s175 ittc seakeeping committee 1978 ittc seakeeping committee 1987 fonseca and guedes soares 2004 and kcs simonsen et al 2013 respectively as shown in these figures the predicted motion responses of the present hybrid hobem agree well with the experimental data at different speeds on the whole both the heave and pitch motions display a dependence on the forward speed of the ship with the increase of speed the maximum values of the motions will increase and occur in longer waves the above results show that the present hybrid hobem has good stability and accuracy in the hydrodynamic calculations of both wall sided modified wigley and non wall sided s175 ships but both of them are slender to see whether the hybrid hobem still applies to more full formed ships we also conduct a motion simulation on a bulk carrier s cb84 with block coefficient c b 0 84 fig 15 shows the heave and pitch motions at 8 knot fn 0 099 and 13 5 knot fn 0 166 similar to the results of s175 and kcs shown in figs 13 and 14 the motion responses of the s cb84 are also found to exhibit a dependence on the forward speed and the numerical results are of satisfactory accuracy as compared with the experimental data yasukawa et al 2018 5 2 2 case of oblique wave for the above simulations of ship motions in head waves where only the surge heave and pitch motions arise the viscous damping is very small and can be disregarded however when it comes to ships advancing in oblique waves six degree motion responses could occur simultaneously in this case the potential flow theory will over predict the roll motion if no correction is made to the roll damping therefore an additional viscous roll damping coefficient λ e 44 υ is introduced into the motion equation 34 in the following simulations in oblique waves wave induced motions of s175 at fn 0 275 in bow oblique waves β 1200 and 1500 are computed and shown in fig 16 in the calculations the roll damping coefficient obtained from the numerical free roll decay test chen et al 2018b is used for comparison numerical results in head waves which have been studied in the above section are also included in the figures it can be seen that the agreement between the calculated motion responses and available experimental data ittc seakeeping committee 1978 in oblique waves is satisfactory compared with the results in head waves motion responses in oblique waves seem to have the similar tendency of changes with the incident wavelength but with the decrease of heading angle the resonant wavelengths where the motions take a peak will shift to the shorter wavelength side for the heave motion the difference between the peak values in oblique and head waves is very small however when it comes to the pitch motion we can find that the maximum motion response in head wave is obviously larger than that in oblique waves fig 17 shows the motion responses of s cb84 at 8 knot with different headings i e β 300 1500 and 900 the roll damping coefficient measured by yasukawa et al 2018 is adopted in the numerical simulation as shown in the figures the present hybrid hobem can capture well the trend of motion responses of s cb84 at difference heading angles overall the predicted motions are in good agreement with the measured data yasukawa et al 2018 by comparing the results of different heading angles we can find that for the sway and roll motion responses the motion amplitudes in beam waves β 900 are much larger than that in oblique waves β 300 and 1500 for all of hull forms considered the above numerical simulations and analysis show that the present hybrid hobem can achieve satisfactory results of motion responses with different speeds and heading angles compared with the translating pulsating green s function method the hybrid method can obtain more stable numerical results for the non wall sided ship besides since the local steady flow is considered in the free surface and body surface conditions the present method appears to be more accurate than the 3dtp and rpm using neumann kelvin linearization 5 3 added resistance in head and oblique waves after knowledge of ship motion responses and hydrodynamic characteristics added assistance can then be calculated the computed and experimental results fujii and takahashi 1975 nakamura and naito 1977 of added resistances on s175 at fn 0 25 in head waves are shown in fig 18 it can be observed that the present numerical results agree fairly well with the measured data for comparison added resistances computed by strip method rpm seo et al 2013 and 3dtp based on a semi analytical scheme hong et al 2016b incorporated with far field formulation are also included in the figure overall results of the different numerical methods are similar to each other and the agreement between the computed results and experimental data is satisfactory however some differences among computed results are shown especially in short waves and peak value frequency in strip method the magnitudes of added resistances in short waves are underestimated while the peak value is overestimated in rpm and 3dtp the calculation precision is satisfactory at most frequencies but near the peak value frequency they give a slightly smaller magnitude of added resistance than the experimental data the added resistance of kcs is also calculated by the present hybrid hobem fig 19 shows the computed and experimental results simonsen et al 2013 of added resistance at fn 0 26 for comparison numerical results of 3dtp hong et al 2016b and aegir joncquez 2009 which is a time domain rankine source code are also included in this figure it can be seen that the agreement between the present numerical results and the experimental data is satisfactory and similar to the results shown in fig 18 the added resistances calculated by the present hybrid hobem seems to be more close to the measured data especially near the short wave length and peak value frequency in order to investigate the influence of forward speed and incident wave angle on the added resistance further numerical calculations are conducted on s175 with different speeds and headings fig 20 shows the added resistances for s175 at fn 0 15 0 20 0 25 and 0 30 in head waves it can be seen that a quite satisfactory agreement between numerical and experimental results is achieved for all the speeds considered the added resistance display an evident dependence on the forward speed with the increase of speed the added resistance increases considerably and the peak value frequency moves into the longer wave range this is similar to the results of motion responses shown in fig 13 the influence of the incident wave angle on the added resistance can be seen in fig 21 which illustrates the added resistance on s175 at fn 0 25 for three different headings i e β 1200 1500 and 1800 the good agreement between the numerical and experimental results indicates that the present method can work well in predicting the added resistances in both head and oblique waves from fig 21 it can be found that the heading angles appear to have a significant influence on the added resistance the wave length of the maximum added resistance increases with increased heading angle for the values of the maximum added resistances at different heading angles an interesting phenomenon is observed the maximum added resistance in head waves β 1800 is much larger than that at β 1200 but almost the same as that at β 1500 this is probably because of the additional attribution due to sway roll and yaw motions in oblique waves salvesen 1974 the added resistances of s cb84 in head and oblique waves are also calculated by the present hybrid hobem the comparison between the numerical and experimental results yasukawa et al 2018 is shown in fig 22 overall the present method capture well the tendency of added resistances at 13kn in head waves β 1800 and 8kn in oblique waves β 1500 compared with the results of skfm strip theory based kochin function method yasukawa et al 2018 the present calculations are closer to the experimental data especially for the short wavelength region from a practical application perspective the present method can predict the added resistance on s cb84 with satisfactory accuracy 6 conclusions in this paper a frequency domain hybrid higher order boundary element method using a combination of the translating pulsating green s function and the rankine source is developed within the framework of potential flow theory the intention of this development is to provide a robust and accurate numerical tool for the hydrodynamic analysis of ships advancing in waves by introducing a wall sided artificial control surface the whole fluid domain is divided into two subdomains one encompassing the ship and the other on the outside in the present method in the outer domain the translating pulsating green s function method is used so as to guarantee the radiation condition for any frequency the boundary integral equation is constructed on the control surface and a semi analytical scheme with high efficiency and accuracy is adopted to calculate the integrals of the green s function over panels in the inner domain the rankine panel method is adopted the use of rankine source makes the present method flexible to the free surface condition to consider the effects of the steady flow the steady potential is incorporated in the inner free surface condition and the m j terms of the body surface condition the hobem is applied to discretize and solve the inner integral equation in which the gauss legendre quadrature is employed to calculate the influence coefficients by using the continuous conditions between the two subdomains the solutions in the outer and inner domains are matched on the control surface and a coupled linear equation system is formulated for the velocity potentials on the boundaries a computer code based on the hybrid hobem is developed for the hydrodynamic calculations to investigate the convergence of this code the hydrodynamic forces on a mathematical ship model modified wigley hull are calculated numerical results show that the present method has good mesh convergence and the computational domain can be limited to a relatively small region to improve the calculation efficiency after the convergence study the developed code is applied in the computations of motions and added resistance for ships advancing in waves wave induced motions of two slender ships with and without flare i e s175 and modified wigley in head waves are first evaluated the computed results are compared against the available experimental data and other numerical solutions of the rankine panel method and translating pulsating green s function method it is found that the present results show better agreement with the experimental data and compared with the translating pulsating green s function method the hybrid hobem is more stable for the non wall sided ship s175 then the motion responses and added resistance at various forward speeds and heading angles are investigated besides the s175 a newer container ship kcs and a bulk carrier s cb84 with block coefficient c b 0 84 are also considered in the calculations the motions and added resistance are found to display a similar dependence on the forward speed and heading angle and through the comparison between the numerical and experimental results it is confirmed that for both the slender and full formed ships the present hybrid hobem is able to produce satisfactory predictions at different speeds and heading angles declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

22314,the response of pipelines to transverse impact loads by dropped objects is investigated experimentally and numerically a series of experiments are carried out to examine the relevant effects including the bed conditions rigid or flexible seabed and impact energy a finite element numerical model is established to determine the dynamic response and it is validated against the experimental results showing good consistency an extensive parametric study is conducted to examine the effects from various factors including the velocity weight and shape of dropped objects pipeline wall thickness concrete coating internal pressure and free pipe span length the effects of seabed flexibility burial depth and soil properties on pipeline response are studied with a coupled eulerian lagrangian method able to simulate large deformation of the soil based on these analyses the model applicability is validated and the research results give an insight to the effects of the various mechanisms on pipeline response which provides a considerable reference for engineering design of submarine pipelines keywords submarine pipeline transient impact sensitive analysis cel method seabed flexibility burial depth 1 introduction submarine pipelines are often considered as the lifelines of the petroleum industry which indicates their importance to offshore oil and gas transportation zeng et al 2015 with the increasing development of ocean energy exploration the safety and stability of pipelines have drawn much concern with the increase in human third party activities in the offshore areas pipelines are likely to suffer impact loads due by dropped objects due to platform operation or anchor work or even fishing gear ivanović et al 2011 longva et al 2013 esmaeili and ivanović 2014 statistically in china offshore areas third party damage is the main factor to cause pipeline failure al warthan et al 1993 mott macdonald ltd 2003 kawsar et al 2015 and as shown in fig 1 the impact loads from dropped objects are the primary type of third party damage this may cause pipeline rupture or buckling xue and hoo fatt 2001 and could lead to either economic or environmental wang et al 2013 severe damages thus in order to ensure the safety of pipelines the effect of impact loads must be taken into consideration considerable research efforts have been devoted to obtain the dynamic response and to estimate the damage of pipelines under impact loads several experiments were carried out thomas et al 1976 ghosh et al 1981 jones et al 1992 kristoffersen et al 2013 to examine the mechanical characteristics of tubular members under lateral impact loads theoretical and numerical models ellinas and walker 1983 guedes soares and soreide 1983 wierzbicki and suh 1988 jones and shen 1992 bai and pedersen 1993 have been developed to obtain the response and damage extent of pipes additionally some other influences are considered the effects of internal pressure chen and shen 1998 dou and liu 2015 axial pre loading zeinoddini et al 1998 eyvazinejad firouzsalari and showkati 2013 and the seabed soil properties arabzadeh and zeinoddini 2011 zeinoddini et al 2013 are examined which were found to have significant effects in previous studies the dynamic response of pipes has received attention in which the impact between pipelines and dropped objects is simulated as a transient process yu et al 2016 proposed a numerical modal approach to predict the deformation of pipelines which simplified the seabed soil to a rigid body furthermore for the sake of considering the effect of seabed soil gao et al 2016 investigated the anchor penetration process experimentally and numerically which provided a reference for pipeline safety protection however the pipe soil interaction has not been involved in that model wang et al 2015 2016 studied the response of impacted pipelines resting on a flexible seabed but the effect of burial depth was not considered det norske veritas 2010 recommended empirical expressions to estimate dent depth of steel pipelines during the impact process but it overestimates the damage extent in many situations most previous studies focused on only several factors for impacted pipeline response in this way some other influences for example the soil properties burial depth internal pressure and free span length for a suspended pipeline among others are neglected which are of importance for engineering practice in this study the response of pipelines subjected to transient impact loads from dropped objects is systematically analysed experimentally and numerically particularly the effects of bed flexibility soil properties and burial depth are included with a coupled eulerian lagrange method hereafter referred to as cel method which is appropriate to solve the large deformation problem involved in the numerical model a series of model impact tests are first carried out to examine some influences on the pipeline damage numerical models of pipelines impacted by objects are then established and validated by the experimental results finally with this validated model an extensive parametric study is carried out to investigate the effects of various parameters on pipeline response including the pipe geometry concrete thickness internal pressure free span length velocities weights and shapes of dropped objects seabed flexibility soil properties and burial depth 2 experimental details a series of impact tests were designed to examine the main influences on the pipeline response namely velocity and weight of dropped objects besides the effects of burial depth and ground conditions are also considered subsequently the pipeline deformation characteristics were investigated details of the experiment are described in the following 2 1 experimental set up the main steps of the experiment consist of lifting the dropped object to a specific height and releasing it to fall vertically on the pipeline specimen placed on different ground conditions the scale ratio of this experiment is 1 10 and the major experimental equipment is depicted in fig 2 fig 2 a shows the release device assembled by aluminium profiles which is about 2 5 m high 1 5 m wide and 2 m long there is a jacking system consisting of one fixed pulley one winch and steel wires on the frame therefore this device can raise objects to the defined height dropped object models with different weights 1 2 3 kg which correspond to 1000 kg 2000 kg and 3000 kg converting to full scale are depicted in fig 2 b to simulate the seabed ground conditions the soil is confined to a box or a tank shown in fig 2 c which is 1 m long 0 6 m wide and 0 5 m high and equipped with some drain holes at the bottom for soil consolidation correspondingly the sand with a density of 1800 kg m3 is taken as the soil medium on account of its convenience for consolidation the detailed properties of the pipe specimen used in this experiment are listed in table 1 a coordinate measuring machine hereafter referred to as cmm shown in fig 2 d is employed to obtain the deformed geometries of the pipe specimen the cmm is equipped with three mutually orthogonal axes of motion which form a typical three dimensional system of coordinates each of the axes has a scale system to locate itself a laser probe attached to this coordinate system can accurately measure and record the distance between the probe and the target point based on this measurement principle the deformed information of pipe specimen is produced by matlab programs 2 2 experimental plan several groups of experiments are designed to examine the main influences on the pipeline response seen in table 2 conditions a b c shown in fig 3 a c represent three different ground conditions namely concrete ground condition simulating the rigid seabed sandy ground condition simulating the sandy seabed buried condition simulating the pipeline buried in a sandy seabed cases 1 to 5 are aimed to examine the effects of velocities and weights of the dropped objects as comparison cases 6 to 10 and 11 to 15 are aimed to investigate the effect of ground conditions prior to the impact experiment both ends of the pipeline specimen were fixed to prevent any shift then the dropped object was lifted to the specific height by the release device the relative position of the dropped object and the pipeline specimen was adjusted to ensure that the vertical impact will occurs at the midpoint of the pipeline specimen finally the dropped object was released to complete one case the deformation geometry can be obtained by the cmm it should be noticed that for the cases considering the effect of seabed soil the mechanical properties of the sand sample are measured by the direct shear test before the impact 2 3 results and discussion most impacts are expected to result in a local damage dent cosham and hopkins 2004 which may cause pipeline rupture or buckling the definitions of dent dimension are illustrated in fig 4 a b and some dent dimension results of pipe specimens are listed in table 3 the dent depth δ and width w can be defined clearly as fig 4 a in general the dent length l is the defined as the length of the pipeline damage along the axial direction while considering the entire defective area most part of this domain is insignificant which would increase unnecessary calculation burden and dilute the damage extent following the initial definition here one parameter c the critical ratio of dent depth δ to pipeline d diameter is employed as the tolerance of dent damage to determine a reasonable dent length it is impractical to follow the undamaged rules strictly δ d 0 the green dash dot lines in fig 4 b dnv rp f107 2010 which is the widely used guideline for risk assessment and protection of pipelines in the offshore industry kawsar et al 2015 yu et al 2016 wang et al 2016 points out that the dent less than 5 of the diameter is regarded as the minor damage with no maintenance requirement therefore to focus on the severe damage domain in this experiment 0 01 is determined for the value of c among the three forms of dent dimension pipeline dent depth δ is a key parameter for the pipeline damage assessment dnv rp f107 2010 therefore this parameter is the main one observed in this experiment to determine the pipeline damage on scene photographs of the impacted pipe specimens of case 11 and case 3 are shown in figs 5 7 it shows that there is almost no global deformation but the local dent damage can be observed fig 6 shows the geometric profile of the pipeline specimen of case 3 the dent depth of the transverse profile is maximum marked with red dashed line in the centre of the impact area to give an overview of the impact area the corresponding deformation depth contour can be obtained and shown in fig 7 the deformation contour distribution is approximately of oval form the deformation depth in the centre is largest and decreases to sides in general the results of all cases in the form of dent depth are depicted in fig 8 and fig 9 it shows that the dent depth increases dramatically with the increase in release height and weight of dropped object models for example when the release height increases from 0 4 m to 1 0 m the dent depth of the pipeline on concrete ground increases by 49 5 when the weight of dropped object increases from 1 kg to 3 kg the increment of dent depth reaches to 108 1 that is mainly because both factors contribute to the impact energy wang et al 2016 furthermore the ground condition plays an important role in pipeline response with other identical conditions m 3 kg h 1 m the dent depth can be reduced by 5 3 and 24 7 when the pipeline is placed on sandy soil or buried when the pipes are placed on flexible seabed part of the impact energy will be absorbed in the global elastic deformation zeinoddini et al 2013 wang et al 2015 and this is why the dent depth decreases however the sandy soil under the pipe has a limited protection effect the protection effect of the soil cover is more significant before the object contact with the pipeline the impact energy will be dissipated through the penetration process gao et al 2016 therefore increase the burial depth is a good measure 3 numerical model description a general purpose advanced finite element program abaqus dassault systemes 2016 has been employed with the dynamic explicit algorithm to simulate this transient impact process meanwhile geometrical and material nonlinearities such as elastic plastic material behaviour of both pipelines and soil are considered especially pipe soil interaction and soil large deformation are involved with cel method 3 1 numerical method during the impact process the soil medium around the pipeline will be penetrated and will deform much which probably causes element distortion and convergence problems the cel method has proved to solve large deformation problems and has been applied widely in geotechnical simulation qiu et al 2011 zhao and liu 2015 in this study simulations involving pipe soil interaction are set up with the cel method which consists of pipeline seabed and dropped object in the cel model both the lagrangian element and eulerian element are employed and coupled seabed soil which is prone to distort excessively is discretized with eulerian elements the eulerian elements keep uniform and the eulerian meshes are fixed in space soil material flows through those meshes and can be traced with the eulerian volume friction evf on the other hand pipes and dropped objects with high stiffness are discretized with lagrangian elements the interaction and boundaries between the lagrangian and the eulerian elements are solved with the penalty function method 3 2 modelling the pipeline is modelled as a lagrangian domain and is discretized with four node reduced integration shell elements s4r geometries and material properties of the pipe are in common ranges for submarine pipelines in offshore engineering the pipeline outer diameter d is 550 mm and the wall thickness t is 8 mm the pipeline material is x65 steel young s module is 206 gpa poisson s ratio is 0 3 density is 7850 kg m3 yield strength is 448 mpa the linear isotropic strain hardening model has been adopted to simulate the mechanical properties of the steel pipeline material the number of circumferential elements is 36 the longitudinal element size near the impact area is set equal to approximately 0 06 d which was proved to provide an economical and reasonably accurate simulation the mesh density decreases to both ends seabed soil is modelled as eulerian domain and discretized with eulerian brick hexahedron elements with reduced integration ec3d8r with respect to the heave of the surrounding soil due to the penetration process one void region is set above the soil material region to contain the deformed soil as shown in fig 10 to relieve the boundary conditions the soil dimension is determined as 20d long 12d wide 6d high it should be noted that the height of 6d refers to the distance between the pipeline bottom and the seabed bottom the total height of the soil part equals to 6d d d h including the distance between seabed bottom and pipeline bottom 6d the pipeline diameter d burial depth d and the height of the void region h finer meshes are adopted for the region close to the dropped object the effect of mesh size was studied and it was found that the minimum mesh size of 0 05d with critical time of 5 04 10 5s is enough to achieve a convergent result the a series of mesh sizes 0 01d 0 2d are employed to discretize the soil body the simulation results and the corresponding model details critical time element numbers cpu time are shown in fig 11 and table 4 respectively it seems that the soil resistance is larger as discretized with bigger size elements which finally underestimates the pipeline damage the converged result is achieved for the minimum mesh sizes smaller than 0 05d meanwhile to reduce the calculation time the optimal minimum mesh size near the dropped object is determined as 0 05d with the critical time of 5 04 10 5s the seabed soil medium is taken as clay which is widely found for example in the chengdao oilfield sea area of china in this model the elasto plastic soil material obeys the mohr coulomb constitutive model m c model which is the most widely used falling in the category of elastic plastic models gao et al 2016 jiang and xie 2011 the governing equation of the m c model s yield surface is written as eq 1 according to previous work andersen et al 2005 wang et al 2010 gao et al 2016 zhang and andersen 2017 and the undrained conditions the soil parameters are determined the poisson ratio and the elastic modulus are taken as μ 0 49 and e 500su where s u is the undrained shearing strength the zero friction angle φ and dilatancy angle ψ are assumed for the soil 1 f r mc q p tan φ c 0 where q is expressed as q 3 j 2 j 2 is the second invariant of deviator stress tensor p is the mean stress defined as p trac σ φ is the inclination angle of p q stress plane in m c yielding surface known as the friction angle with a range of 0 90 c is the cohesive force of the material r mc can be defined as 2 r mc 1 3 cos φ sin θ π 3 1 3 cos θ π 3 tan φ where θ is the deflection angle calculated from 3 cos 3 θ r 3 q 3 where r is the third invariant of the deviator stress tensor the process of dropped object penetration into the soil will induce large plastic strain and strain rate on the clay thus the effect of strain softening and strain rate is considered and is based on the empirical model of einav and randolph 2005 the user subroutine vusdfld dassault systemes 2016 is utilized to update the undrained shear strength to reflect rate dependence and strain softening 4 s u 1 μ log max γ max γ ref γ ref δ rem 1 δ rem e 3 ξ ξ 95 s u 0 where s u 0 is the initial undrained shear strength μ is the rate of change of s u per log cycle typically between 0 05 and 0 2 γ ref is reference shear strain rate and is usually taken as 3 10 6 s γ max is maximum shear strain rate defined as γ max δ ε 1 δ ε 3 δ t δ ε 1 and δ ε 3 are cumulative major and minor strains δ t is time increment δ rem is residual degradation factor which is defined as the inverse of remoulded sensitivity s t ξ is the accumulated absolute maximum plastic shear strain and ξ 95 represents the value of ξ at which the soil has undergone 95 of the s u 0 reduction in strength due to remoulding the dropped object is also modelled in the lagrangian domain to reduce the computational cost the dropped objects are described with linear elastic model and imposed with rigid body constraints the hydrodynamic loadings adhered to the object namely the added water mass is considered in terms of equivalent density eq 5 5 ρ e ρ d 1 ρ w ρ d c a where ρ e is the equivalent density of the object ρ w is the density of water ρ d is the density of the object c a is the coefficient of hydrodynamic added mass 3 3 interaction and boundary conditions in this study a general contact algorithm based on penalty contact method is employed which can automatically define the interaction relations between objects pipelines and seabed soil furthermore the frictionless property has been introduced in the interaction between the dropped object and the pipe outer surface a friction coefficient of 0 3 is set for the interaction between the pipe and the seabed soil capped end boundary condition is set for both pipe and seabed soil prior to the impact analysis the soil medium is applied an initial geostatic stress field and reaches the equilibrium state under gravity and sea water pressure in a geostatic step this converged stress condition will influence soil behaviour and the pipeline response in the following analysis zeinoddini et al 2013 3 4 model validation 3 4 1 present tests the aforementioned experiments are used to examine the accuracy of the established numerical model cases of condition a and c i e case 1 6 and case 11 15 are taken to be reconstructed in the numerical model which can show a significant difference from each other comparison results of the dent depth are shown in fig 12 and fig 13 in general the results from the numerical model and experiment are in reasonable agreement however there are still some differences especially for cases of the buried pipe specimen condition c those differences seem to be caused by the heterogeneity in soil strength as the sandy soil needs to be consolidated prior to each impact test it is hard to keep the soil consolidation degree and homogeneity in each case exactly identical which would directly influence the soil strength furthermore transverse profiles at the maximum deformation position of pipes in case 11 and 3 are depicted in fig 14 and fig 15 from which the detailed deformation characteristics can be seen the red solid line shows the pipe original transverse profile the green dashed dot line and the blue dashed line describes the deformed transverse profile from the numerical simulation and the experiment respectively in case 11 shown in fig 14 the pipe specimen was buried in sandy soil which experienced a local small deformation there is almost no difference between the experimental and numerical results in case 3 as shown in fig 15 the pipe specimen was barely resting on the concrete ground and the relatively large impact energy produced a deeper dent depth and the profile shape tends to become a peach shape the slight discrepancies between the results may be due to the initial geometry imperfection which is neglected in the numerical model 3 4 2 tests from wang et al 2015 anchor impact experiments were conducted by wang et al 2015 on pipelines laid on soft clay they were intended to investigate the effects of pipe soil interaction on pipeline response subjected to impact loads the pipeline length diameter wall thickness and yield strength were 4 9 m 74 mm 2 8 mm and 245 mpa respectively before the impact test the flat plate dilatometer was employed to characterize the undrained shear strength of the soft clay in the selected measurement locations in the experimental procedure the pipeline specimen were laid on soft clay or buried at the depth of 0 1 m and 0 2 m then a navy anchor 100 kg was released from the specific height to finish each impact test in fig 16 a relatively good correlation between the experiment results and the numerical predictions can be achieved the existing discrepancies are believed to be caused by the measurement error in soil mechanic properties it is hard to ensure that the undrained shear strength of clay in the measurement location is identical to that in the impact locations furthermore the geometric details of the model anchor which were neglected in the numerical model due to lack of information may be another reason to cause those differences from the above comparison results and analysis the robustness of the numerical model on both sand and clay has been verified good agreement can be reached and the numerical model shows a good performance to estimate the pipe response due to transient impact loads 4 parametric study the established numerical model is considered as validated against the present experiments based on this validated model an extensive parametric study has been subsequently conducted the results are mainly presented in terms of a curve of normalized dent depth besides the transverse profile and longitudinal displacement curves are also displayed 4 1 impact energy the effect of impact energy on dent depth of an identical pipeline resting on rigid bed are shown in fig 17 and fig 18 which consists of the effect of impact velocity in fig 17 and dropped object mass in fig 18 as may be noticed the dent depth becomes appreciably larger with the increase in velocity and weight however the increasing trends of the two factors differ slightly the increasing trend in fig 17 is stable because the kinetic energy is proportional to the velocity squared however the increasing trend in fig 18 becomes smaller gradually it is believed that with the increase in mass the object geometry dimension the impact area between pipeline and object also becomes larger which decreases the contact pressure and the localized dent damage 4 2 shape of the dropped object according to dnv rp f107 2010 most dropped objects are containers baskets and crane blocks in box or round shapes in the limiting condition sharp corner of the dropped objects may collide with pipelines to account of those scenarios three typical object shapes cube sphere and cone shown in fig 19 suggested in the literature yang et al 2011 kawsar et al 2015 are employed to investigate the effect of object shapes it is noticed that no internal pressure and burial depth are assumed for the target pipeline significant effect on pipeline dent depth can be observed from fig 20 the dent damage caused by the cone object is the most severe followed by the sphere and the cube that is because of the differences in their contact areas with pipelines which will further influence the contact pressure to give an insight into the deformation characteristics the deformed transverse profile is depicted in fig 21 it shows that under the impact by an object with a flat surface like the cube the dent damage zone becomes broader and shallower around the impact position the corresponding longitudinal profile for pipeline dent depth is shown in fig 22 for pipeline impacted by a cube the dent depth around the impact area is nearly uniform indicating a u shape distribution the dent depth becomes concentrated on the hit point centre and decreases to both ends indicating a v shape distribution when pipelines are impacted by cone or sphere it seems that with the increase in the contact area with the pipeline more energy is absorbed in pipeline global deflection 4 3 pipeline wall thickness fig 23 gives the comparison between dent depths for pipelines with different wall thicknesses it is noticed that the dent depth gradually decreases with the increase in wall thickness this coincides with zhang s results 2016 that the pipeline stiffness is affected by the wall thickness and thin walled pipelines are more prone to failure it should be pointed out that when the wall thickness is greater than 10 mm the reduction of the dent depth is limited when increasing the wall thickness for example under the impact of a sphere of 3000 kg v 5 m s the dent depth for the pipeline with a wall thickness of 14 mm is approximately 70 mm and δ d is over 10 which is expected to cause pipeline leakage 4 4 concrete coating thickness submarine pipelines are always protected with a concrete coating for on bottom stability and mechanical protection to consider this effect a plastic damage model is employed to simulate the reinforced concrete coating shown in fig 24 the concrete strength parameters are in the common range for pipeline engineering under the impact by a sphere of 3000 kg the responses of pipelines with different concrete coating thicknesses are simulated the effect on pipeline dent depth is shown in fig 25 the dent depth decreases linearly with the increase in concrete coating thickness it is believed that the concrete coating can improve the pipeline resistance to impact loads and reduce the dent damage even so in some situations the dent damage is still relatively severe for example when the impact velocity is 5 m s a normalized dent depth of 0 12 66 mm is produced for a pipeline covered by a 100 mm thick concrete coating this is in agreement with the findings of yang et al 2011 that the protection from concrete coating alone is insufficient other measurements should be taken to lower the impact damage 4 5 internal pressure fig 26 gives the comparisons between the responses of pipelines under different internal pressures it is noticed that the pipelines are resting on a rigid bed the results of dent depth are depicted in fig 26 there is a declining trend of the dent depth with the increase in internal pressures which is more significant under higher impact velocities it seems that a higher internal pressure could make pipelines become stiffer requiring more impact energy to produce a specific dent depth compared to pipelines with lower pressures that is consistent with the research by zeinoddini et al 2013 who studied the pipeline response with various internal pressures under quasi static impact loads the deformed transverse profiles and longitudinal profiles for pipelines under different internal pressures are shown in fig 27 and fig 28 respectively it shows that the damage domain of pipeline dent is more localized and smaller when the internal pressure increases this may be explained by the enhancement in pipeline equivalent stiffness attributed to internal pressure zhang et al 2016 with the increase in internal pressure due to the enhanced stiffness more impact energy is stored in global elastic potential energy of pipeline which finally leads to a smaller and more localized dent damage 4 6 free span length due to scouring it is frequent that part of the pipeline segments is hanging which is likely to cause failure to give an insight into the failure mechanism suspended pipelines with various free span lengths are considered fig 29 depicts the effect of free span length on dent depth pipelines with longer free span length experience smaller dent depths when compared to those with short span length this difference is significant with the increase in impact velocity for example when the impact velocity is 3 m s the difference between normalized dent depths of pipelines with a free span length of 20 m and zero is 0 05 27 5 mm while when the impact velocity is 7 m s this difference becomes approximately the double vibrations of suspended pipelines will be generated during the impact process the longitudinal profile of the vibration amplitude of the pipeline top nodes with various free span lengths is shown in fig 30 it can be seen that for pipelines with longer free span length the impact process will trigger a broader and larger vibration the vibration amplitude is maximum at the impact area centre and gradually declines to both ends fig 31 shows the pipeline maximum vibration amplitude against the free span length maximum vibration amplitudes increase with the free span length it is pointed out that this gradually intensified vibration could increase the pipeline stress and aggravate the fatigue failure extent of pipelines which is likely to cause a yield failure lou and ming 2015 with the increase in free span length less vertical constraints are imposed on the pipelines it seems that more energy is dissipated in global vibration rather than the localized dent damage which indicates that the suspended pipelines are prone to yield and fatigue failure rather than a local rupture failure 4 7 seabed flexibility seabed flexibility is a key parameter for pipeline response subject to transient impact loads the response of pipelines resting on either flexible seabed with various soil properties or rigid seabed is investigated fig 32 shows the effect of seabed flexibility on pipeline depth it can be seen that pipelines resting on a rigid seabed are more vulnerable to impact damage as compared to those on a flexible seabed which is more convenient when the impact velocity is relatively high besides for pipelines resting on a flexible seabed soil properties undrained shear strength s u also influence the response it seems that with the increase in the undrained shear strength of soil seabed becomes stiffer and the interaction between soil and pipe is diminished thus most of the impact energy is converted to the unrecoverable plastic deformation of pipeline and a deeper dent is expected fig 33 gives the relationship between energy dissipation of seabed soil e s and soil properties it is noticed that for otherwise identical impact conditions e s is equal to the difference between internal energy of the pipeline resting on a rigid seabed and that on a flexible seabed the contribution of soil medium to energy dissipation is considerable under the impact by a sphere of 3000 kg v 3 m s energy dissipation of the flexible seabed s u 2 kpa is nearly 1900 kj indicating that approximately 14 of the total energy has been absorbed in the soil medium rather than in the pipeline plastic deflection besides with the decrease in undrained shear strength of soil medium more energy is absorbed fig 34 gives the longitudinal profile for lateral displacement of the impacted pipeline resting on a flexible seabed it should be noted that only the displacements of pipeline bottom nodes are depicted this figure further supports the explanation given above for pipelines resting on a flexible seabed part of the impact energy is dissipated through pipeline global lateral displacement and deformations which is significant for softer seabed these findings coincide with the research from zeinoddini et al 2013 who studied the effect of seabed flexibility on pipeline response 4 8 burial depth pipelines in high risk areas are usually buried under the seabed to reduce the impact damage trenching is an efficient method for pipeline protection in this section the effects of burial depth and the corresponding soil properties undrained shear strength s u on pipeline responses are investigated the curve of dent depths against various burial depth and soil properties under an identical impact energy sphere object m 3000 kg v 9 m s is plotted in fig 35 the results considering the sssr effects are compared with those that the effect is neglected it shows that the pipeline damage is overestimated without considering the sssr effects it seems that the clay is hardened and the strain rate effect is dominant this is consisted with the results from gao et al 2016 who simulated the anchor penetration on clay and found that the sssr effects significantly increase the soil strength therefore without a specific declaration the results shown in the following analysis include the sssr effects the results also show that there is a dramatic decline in pipeline local damage with the increase in burial depth it is believed that part of the impact energy will be absorbed by the soil medium before the pipeline is impacted which can provide a protective effect however for softer soil medium the contribution to pipeline protection is not appreciable as an example for a flexible seabed with s u 2 kpa the normalized dent depth is approximately 0 09 50 mm even though the burial depth is 2 m furthermore the effect of soil properties is not significant when the burial depth is relatively shallow with different soil properties the damage dents of buried pipelines differ slightly for burial depth less than 0 25 m it seems that under shallow buried conditions large deformation of soil medium is not triggered significantly thus the soil property is not the most important factor to cause pipeline deformation although with the increase in burial depth this effect becomes pronounced this phenomenon can be seen clearly in fig 36 which shows the relationship between dent depth and the soil properties with shallower burial depth the dent depth nearly keeps unchanged with the changes of undrained shear strength while with burial depth larger than 0 5 m the dent depth decreases and this declining trend is more significant for deeper burial depths for recently buried pipelines the backfill soil around the pipe is usually regarded as underconsolidated soil indicating a lower strength in this study it is considered that s u is 10 kpa to 14 kpa for the underconsolidated clay and 18 kpa for the homogenous clay respectively the results of different soil consolidation states are shown in fig 37 which shows that the safety burial depth for homogenous clay is 1 m while this depth increases to 1 5 m for the underconsolidated clay with s u of 10 kpa the obvious differences in safety burial depth are expected to affect the project cost therefore for newly buried pipelines the optimal design burial depth needs to be assessed carefully including considering the mechanical properties and consolidation state of the covering soil to quantify the effect of burial depth d and soil properties s u one simple fitting equation is proposed after trying several strategies bp neural network with strong ability in approximating functions of complex mechanisms zhang and barrion 2006 is employed to fit this equation based on total 45 simulation cases the correlation coefficient r and mean relative error mre is 0 977 and 5 37 which indicates a good correlation between the data and the function it should be noted that there are still more factors that should be considered in this function for example the steel yield strength pipeline diameter wall thickness impact energy object shapes friction coefficient among others in future work a larger number of cases should be simulated and fitted into the bp network to genrate a more robust and applicable approximation 6 δ d f d s u f 2 w 2 f 1 w 1

investigated experimentally and numerically in the current study a numerical model considering pipe soil interaction and able to simulate large soil deformation is established and has been validated against the experimental results after which an extensive parametric study is carried out the effects of a series of parameters on pipeline response are examined the conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the experimental results show that the pipeline dent depth increases with the release height and weight of the dropped object the ground conditions also influence the pipeline deformation response under an identical impact pipelines resting on sandy soil or buried under sandy cover experience smaller damage as compared to pipelines resting on a concrete ground 2 dent depth increases with the increase in impact velocity and weight of dropped objects and decreases with the increase in wall thickness concrete coating and internal pressure the local buckling becomes serious when the dropped object shape is sharper which should be considered as an ultimate condition 3 for suspended pipelines the dent depth decreases with the increase of the free span length while the global vibration becomes enlarged so the fatigue failure should be considered 4 the flexible seabed can dissipate part of the impact energy up to 14 through pipeline global lateral displacement and deformation with the decrease in soil strength the seabed becomes softer and a smaller dent depth up to reduce 25 of the dent depth is expected due to the increasing contribution to energy absorption 5 for buried pipelines the strain softening and strain rate effects should be considered otherwise the pipeline damage is overestimated the dent depth declines clearly with the increase in burial depth furthermore the effect of soil properties becomes pronounced when the burial depth is larger than 0 5 m those results take into account more factors such as the seabed flexibility soil properties and strain effect which are informative for the supplement to the specifications and give some reference to safety designs of submarine pipeline subjected to impact loads acknowledgements

22314,the response of pipelines to transverse impact loads by dropped objects is investigated experimentally and numerically a series of experiments are carried out to examine the relevant effects including the bed conditions rigid or flexible seabed and impact energy a finite element numerical model is established to determine the dynamic response and it is validated against the experimental

lagrangian method able to simulate large deformation of the soil based on these analyses the model applicability is validated and the research results give an insight to the effects of the various mechanisms on pipeline response which provides a considerable reference for engineering design of submarine pipelines keywords submarine pipeline transient impact sensitive analysis cel method seabed flexibility burial depth 1 introduction submarine pipelines are often considered as the lifelines of the petroleum industry which indicates their importance to offshore oil and gas transportation zeng et al 2015 with the increasing development of ocean energy exploration the safety and stability of pipelines have drawn much concern with the increase in human third party activities in the offshore areas pipelines are likely to suffer impact loads due by dropped objects due to platform operation or anchor work or even fishing gear ivanović et al 2011 longva et al 2013 esmaeili and ivanović 2014 statistically in china offshore areas third party damage is the main factor to cause pipeline failure al warthan et al 1993 mott macdonald ltd 2003 kawsar et al 2015 and as shown in fig 1 the impact loads from dropped objects are the primary type of third party damage this may cause pipeline rupture or buckling xue and hoo fatt 2001 and could lead to either economic or environmental wang et al 2013 severe damages thus in order to ensure the safety of pipelines the effect of impact loads must be taken into consideration considerable research efforts have been devoted to obtain the dynamic response and to estimate the damage of pipelines under impact loads several experiments were carried out thomas et al 1976 ghosh et al 1981 jones et al 1992 kristoffersen et al 2013 to examine the mechanical characteristics of tubular members under lateral impact loads theoretical and numerical models ellinas and walker 1983 guedes soares and soreide 1983 wierzbicki and suh 1988 jones and shen 1992 bai and pedersen 1993 have been developed to obtain the response and damage extent of pipes additionally some other influences are considered the effects of internal pressure chen and shen 1998 dou and liu 2015 axial pre loading zeinoddini et al 1998 eyvazinejad firouzsalari and showkati 2013 and the seabed soil properties arabzadeh and zeinoddini 2011 zeinoddini et al 2013 are examined which were found to have significant effects in previous studies the dynamic response of pipes has received attention in which the impact between pipelines and dropped objects is simulated as a transient process yu et al 2016 proposed a numerical modal approach to predict the deformation of pipelines which simplified the seabed soil to a rigid body furthermore for the sake of considering the effect of seabed soil gao et al 2016 investigated the anchor penetration process experimentally and numerically which provided a reference for pipeline safety protection however the pipe soil interaction has not been involved in that model wang et al 2015 2016 studied the response of impacted pipelines resting on a flexible seabed but the effect of burial depth was not considered det norske veritas 2010 recommended empirical expressions to estimate dent depth of steel pipelines during the impact process but it overestimates the damage extent in many situations most previous studies focused on only several factors for impacted pipeline response in this way some other influences for example the soil properties burial depth internal pressure and free span length for a suspended pipeline among others are neglected which are of importance for engineering practice in this study the response of pipelines subjected to transient impact loads from dropped objects is systematically analysed experimentally and numerically particularly the effects of bed flexibility soil properties and burial depth are included with a coupled eulerian lagrange method hereafter referred to as cel method which is appropriate to solve the large deformation problem involved in the numerical model a series of model impact tests are first carried out to examine some influences on the pipeline damage numerical models of pipelines impacted by objects are then established and validated by the experimental results finally with this validated model an extensive parametric study is carried out to investigate the effects of various parameters on pipeline response including the pipe geometry concrete thickness internal pressure free span length velocities weights and shapes of dropped objects seabed flexibility soil properties and burial depth 2 experimental details a series of impact tests were designed to examine the main influences on the pipeline response namely velocity and weight of dropped objects besides the effects of burial depth and ground conditions are also considered subsequently the pipeline deformation characteristics were investigated details of the experiment are described in the following 2 1 experimental set up the main steps of the experiment consist of lifting the dropped object to a specific height and releasing it to fall vertically on the pipeline specimen placed on different ground conditions the scale ratio of this experiment is 1 10 and the major experimental equipment is depicted in fig 2 fig 2 a shows the release device assembled by aluminium profiles which is about 2 5 m high 1 5 m wide and 2 m long there is a jacking system consisting of one fixed pulley one winch and steel wires on the frame therefore this device can raise objects to the defined height dropped object models with different weights 1 2 3 kg which correspond to 1000 kg 2000 kg and 3000 kg converting to full scale are depicted in fig 2 b to simulate the seabed ground conditions the soil is confined to a box or a tank shown in fig 2 c which is 1 m long 0 6 m wide and 0 5 m high and equipped with some drain holes at the bottom for soil consolidation correspondingly the sand with a density of 1800 kg m3 is taken as the soil medium on account of its convenience for consolidation the detailed properties of the pipe specimen used in this experiment are listed in table 1 a coordinate measuring machine hereafter referred to as cmm shown in fig 2 d is employed to obtain the deformed geometries of the pipe specimen the cmm is equipped with three mutually orthogonal axes of motion which form a typical three dimensional system of coordinates each of the axes has a scale system to locate itself a laser probe attached to this coordinate system can accurately measure and record the distance between the probe and the target point based on this measurement principle the deformed information of pipe specimen is produced by matlab programs 2 2 experimental plan several groups of experiments are designed to examine the main influences on the pipeline response seen in table 2 conditions a b c shown in fig 3 a c represent three different ground conditions namely concrete ground condition simulating the rigid seabed sandy ground condition simulating the sandy seabed buried condition simulating the pipeline buried in a sandy seabed cases 1 to 5 are aimed to examine the effects of velocities and weights of the dropped objects as comparison cases 6 to 10 and 11 to 15 are aimed to investigate the effect of ground conditions prior to the impact experiment both ends of the pipeline specimen were fixed to prevent any shift then the dropped object was lifted to the specific height by the release device the relative position of the dropped object and the pipeline specimen was adjusted to ensure that the vertical impact will occurs at the midpoint of the pipeline specimen finally the dropped object was released to complete one case the deformation geometry can be obtained by the cmm it should be noticed that for the cases considering the effect of seabed soil the mechanical properties of the sand sample are measured by the direct shear test before the impact 2 3 results and discussion most impacts are expected to result in a local damage dent cosham and hopkins 2004 which may cause pipeline rupture or buckling the definitions of dent dimension are illustrated in fig 4 a b and some dent dimension results of pipe specimens are listed in table 3 the dent depth δ and width w can be defined clearly as fig 4 a in general the dent length l is the defined as the length of the pipeline damage along the axial direction while considering the entire defective area most part of this domain is insignificant which would increase unnecessary calculation burden and dilute the damage extent following the initial definition here one parameter c the critical ratio of dent depth δ to pipeline d diameter is employed as the tolerance of dent damage to determine a reasonable dent length it is impractical to follow the undamaged rules strictly δ d 0 the green dash dot lines in fig 4 b dnv rp f107 2010 which is the widely used guideline for risk assessment and protection of pipelines in the offshore industry kawsar et al 2015 yu et al 2016 wang et al 2016 points out that the dent less than 5 of the diameter is regarded as the minor damage with no maintenance requirement therefore to focus on the severe damage domain in this experiment 0 01 is determined for the value of c among the three forms of dent dimension pipeline dent depth δ is a key parameter for the pipeline damage assessment dnv rp f107 2010 therefore this parameter is the main one observed in this experiment to determine the pipeline damage on scene photographs of the impacted pipe specimens of case 11 and case 3 are shown in figs 5 7 it shows that there is almost no global deformation but the local dent damage can be observed fig 6 shows the geometric profile of the pipeline specimen of case 3 the dent depth of the transverse profile is maximum marked with red dashed line in the centre of the impact area to give an overview of the impact area the corresponding deformation depth contour can be obtained and shown in fig 7 the deformation contour distribution is approximately of oval form the deformation depth in the centre is largest and decreases to sides in general the results of all cases in the form of dent depth are depicted in fig 8 and fig 9 it shows that the dent depth increases dramatically with the increase in release height and weight of dropped object models for example when the release height increases from 0 4 m to 1 0 m the dent depth of the pipeline on concrete ground increases by 49 5 when the weight of dropped object increases from 1 kg to 3 kg the increment of dent depth reaches to 108 1 that is mainly because both factors contribute to the impact energy wang et al 2016 furthermore the ground condition plays an important role in pipeline response with other identical conditions m 3 kg h 1 m the dent depth can be reduced by 5 3 and 24 7 when the pipeline is placed on sandy soil or buried when the pipes are placed on flexible seabed part of the impact energy will be absorbed in the global elastic deformation zeinoddini et al 2013 wang et al 2015 and this is why the dent depth decreases however the sandy soil under the pipe has a limited protection effect the protection effect of the soil cover is more significant before the object contact with the pipeline the impact energy will be dissipated through the penetration process gao et al 2016 therefore increase the burial depth is a good measure 3 numerical model description a general purpose advanced finite element program abaqus dassault systemes 2016 has been employed with the dynamic explicit algorithm to simulate this transient impact process meanwhile geometrical and material nonlinearities such as elastic plastic material behaviour of both pipelines and soil are considered especially pipe soil interaction and soil large deformation are involved with cel method 3 1 numerical method during the impact process the soil medium around the pipeline will be penetrated and will deform much which probably causes element distortion and convergence problems the cel method has proved to solve large deformation problems and has been applied widely in geotechnical simulation qiu et al 2011 zhao and liu 2015 in this study simulations involving pipe soil interaction are set up with the cel method which consists of pipeline seabed and dropped object in the cel model both the lagrangian element and eulerian element are employed and coupled seabed soil which is prone to distort excessively is discretized with eulerian elements the eulerian elements keep uniform and the eulerian meshes are fixed in space soil material flows through those meshes and can be traced with the eulerian volume friction evf on the other hand pipes and dropped objects with high stiffness are discretized with lagrangian elements the interaction and boundaries between the lagrangian and the eulerian elements are solved with the penalty function method 3 2 modelling the pipeline is modelled as a lagrangian domain and is discretized with four node reduced integration shell elements s4r geometries and material properties of the pipe are in common ranges for submarine pipelines in offshore engineering the pipeline outer diameter d is 550 mm and the wall thickness t is 8 mm the pipeline material is x65 steel young s module is 206 gpa poisson s ratio is 0 3 density is 7850 kg m3 yield strength is 448 mpa the linear isotropic strain hardening model has been adopted to simulate the mechanical properties of the steel pipeline material the number of circumferential elements is 36 the longitudinal element size near the impact area is set equal to approximately 0 06 d which was proved to provide an economical and reasonably accurate simulation the mesh density decreases to both ends seabed soil is modelled as eulerian domain and discretized with eulerian brick hexahedron elements with reduced integration ec3d8r with respect to the heave of the surrounding soil due to the penetration process one void region is set above the soil material region to contain the deformed soil as shown in fig 10 to relieve the boundary conditions the soil dimension is determined as 20d long 12d wide 6d high it should be noted that the height of 6d refers to the distance between the pipeline bottom and the seabed bottom the total height of the soil part equals to 6d d d h including the distance between seabed bottom and pipeline bottom 6d the pipeline diameter d burial depth d and the height of the void region h finer meshes are adopted for the region close to the dropped object the effect of mesh size was studied and it was found that the minimum mesh size of 0 05d with critical time of 5 04 10 5s is enough to achieve a convergent result the a series of mesh sizes 0 01d 0 2d are employed to discretize the soil body the simulation results and the corresponding model details critical time element numbers cpu time are shown in fig 11 and table 4 respectively it seems that the soil resistance is larger as discretized with bigger size elements which finally underestimates the pipeline damage the converged result is achieved for the minimum mesh sizes smaller than 0 05d meanwhile to reduce the calculation time the optimal minimum mesh size near the dropped object is determined as 0 05d with the critical time of 5 04 10 5s the seabed soil medium is taken as clay which is widely found for example in the chengdao oilfield sea area of china in this model the elasto plastic soil material obeys the mohr coulomb constitutive model m c model which is the most widely used falling in the category of elastic plastic models gao et al 2016 jiang and xie 2011 the governing equation of the m c model s yield surface is written as eq 1 according to previous work andersen et al 2005 wang et al 2010 gao et al 2016 zhang and andersen 2017 and the undrained conditions the soil parameters are determined the poisson ratio and the elastic modulus are taken as μ 0 49 and e 500su where s u is the undrained shearing strength the zero friction angle φ and dilatancy angle ψ are assumed for the soil 1 f r mc q p tan φ c 0 where q is expressed as q 3 j 2 j 2 is the second invariant of deviator stress tensor p is the mean stress defined as p trac σ φ is the inclination angle of p q stress plane in m c yielding surface known as the friction angle with a range of 0 90 c is the cohesive force of the material r mc can be defined as 2 r mc 1 3 cos φ sin θ π 3 1 3 cos θ π 3 tan φ where θ is the deflection angle calculated from 3 cos 3 θ r 3 q 3 where r is the third invariant of the deviator stress tensor the process of dropped object penetration into the soil will induce large plastic strain and strain rate on the clay thus the effect of strain softening and strain rate is considered and is based on the empirical model of einav and randolph 2005 the user subroutine vusdfld dassault systemes 2016 is utilized to update the undrained shear strength to reflect rate dependence and strain softening 4 s u 1 μ log max γ max γ ref γ ref δ rem 1 δ rem e 3 ξ ξ 95 s u 0 where s u 0 is the initial undrained shear strength μ is the rate of change of s u per log cycle typically between 0 05 and 0 2 γ ref is reference shear strain rate and is usually taken as 3 10 6 s γ max is maximum shear strain rate defined as γ max δ ε 1 δ ε 3 δ t δ ε 1 and δ ε 3 are cumulative major and minor strains δ t is time increment δ rem is residual degradation factor which is defined as the inverse of remoulded sensitivity s t ξ is the accumulated absolute maximum plastic shear strain and ξ 95 represents the value of ξ at which the soil has undergone 95 of the s u 0 reduction in strength due to remoulding the dropped object is also modelled in the lagrangian domain to reduce the computational cost the dropped objects are described with linear elastic model and imposed with rigid body constraints the hydrodynamic loadings adhered to the object namely the added water mass is considered in terms of equivalent density eq 5 5 ρ e ρ d 1 ρ w ρ d c a where ρ e is the equivalent density of the object ρ w is the density of water ρ d is the density of the object c a is the coefficient of hydrodynamic added mass 3 3 interaction and boundary conditions in this study a general contact algorithm based on penalty contact method is employed which can automatically define the interaction relations between objects pipelines and seabed soil furthermore the frictionless property has been introduced in the interaction between the dropped object and the pipe outer surface a friction coefficient of 0 3 is set for the interaction between the pipe and the seabed soil capped end boundary condition is set for both pipe and seabed soil prior to the impact analysis the soil medium is applied an initial geostatic stress field and reaches the equilibrium state under gravity and sea water pressure in a geostatic step this converged stress condition will influence soil behaviour and the pipeline response in the following analysis zeinoddini et al 2013 3 4 model validation 3 4 1 present tests the aforementioned experiments are used to examine the accuracy of the established numerical model cases of condition a and c i e case 1 6 and case 11 15 are taken to be reconstructed in the numerical model which can show a significant difference from each other comparison results of the dent depth are shown in fig 12 and fig 13 in general the results from the numerical model and experiment are in reasonable agreement however there are still some differences especially for cases of the buried pipe specimen condition c those differences seem to be caused by the heterogeneity in soil strength as the sandy soil needs to be consolidated prior to each impact test it is hard to keep the soil consolidation degree and homogeneity in each case exactly identical which would directly influence the soil strength furthermore transverse profiles at the maximum deformation position of pipes in case 11 and 3 are depicted in fig 14 and fig 15 from which the detailed deformation characteristics can be seen the red solid line shows the pipe original transverse profile the green dashed dot line and the blue dashed line describes the deformed transverse profile from the numerical simulation and the experiment respectively in case 11 shown in fig 14 the pipe specimen was buried in sandy soil which experienced a local small deformation there is almost no difference between the experimental and numerical results in case 3 as shown in fig 15 the pipe specimen was barely resting on the concrete ground and the relatively large impact energy produced a deeper dent depth and the profile shape tends to become a peach shape the slight discrepancies between the results may be due to the initial geometry imperfection which is neglected in the numerical model 3 4 2 tests from wang et al 2015 anchor impact experiments were conducted by wang et al 2015 on pipelines laid on soft clay they were intended to investigate the effects of pipe soil interaction on pipeline response subjected to impact loads the pipeline length diameter wall thickness and yield strength were 4 9 m 74 mm 2 8 mm and 245 mpa respectively before the impact test the flat plate dilatometer was employed to characterize the undrained shear strength of the soft clay in the selected measurement locations in the experimental procedure the pipeline specimen were laid on soft clay or buried at the depth of 0 1 m and 0 2 m then a navy anchor 100 kg was released from the specific height to finish each impact test in fig 16 a relatively good correlation between the experiment results and the numerical predictions can be achieved the existing discrepancies are believed to be caused by the measurement error in soil mechanic properties it is hard to ensure that the undrained shear strength of clay in the measurement location is identical to that in the impact locations furthermore the geometric details of the model anchor which were neglected in the numerical model due to lack of information may be another reason to cause those differences from the above comparison results and analysis the robustness of the numerical model on both sand and clay has been verified good agreement can be reached and the numerical model shows a good performance to estimate the pipe response due to transient impact loads 4 parametric study the established numerical model is considered as validated against the present experiments based on this validated model an extensive parametric study has been subsequently conducted the results are mainly presented in terms of a curve of normalized dent depth besides the transverse profile and longitudinal displacement curves are also displayed 4 1 impact energy the effect of impact energy on dent depth of an identical pipeline resting on rigid bed are shown in fig 17 and fig 18 which consists of the effect of impact velocity in fig 17 and dropped object mass in fig 18 as may be noticed the dent depth becomes appreciably larger with the increase in velocity and weight however the increasing trends of the two factors differ slightly the increasing trend in fig 17 is stable because the kinetic energy is proportional to the velocity squared however the increasing trend in fig 18 becomes smaller gradually it is believed that with the increase in mass the object geometry dimension the impact area between pipeline and object also becomes larger which decreases the contact pressure and the localized dent damage 4 2 shape of the dropped object according to dnv rp f107 2010 most dropped objects are containers baskets and crane blocks in box or round shapes in the limiting condition sharp corner of the dropped objects may collide with pipelines to account of those scenarios three typical object shapes cube sphere and cone shown in fig 19 suggested in the literature yang et al 2011 kawsar et al 2015 are employed to investigate the effect of object shapes it is noticed that no internal pressure and burial depth are assumed for the target pipeline significant effect on pipeline dent depth can be observed from fig 20 the dent damage caused by the cone object is the most severe followed by the sphere and the cube that is because of the differences in their contact areas with pipelines which will further influence the contact pressure to give an insight into the deformation characteristics the deformed transverse profile is depicted in fig 21 it shows that under the impact by an object with a flat surface like the cube the dent damage zone becomes broader and shallower around the impact position the corresponding longitudinal profile for pipeline dent depth is shown in fig 22 for pipeline impacted by a cube the dent depth around the impact area is nearly uniform indicating a u shape distribution the dent depth becomes concentrated on the hit point centre and decreases to both ends indicating a v shape distribution when pipelines are impacted by cone or sphere it seems that with the increase in the contact area with the pipeline more energy is absorbed in pipeline global deflection 4 3 pipeline wall thickness fig 23 gives the comparison between dent depths for pipelines with different wall thicknesses it is noticed that the dent depth gradually decreases with the increase in wall thickness this coincides with zhang s results 2016 that the pipeline stiffness is affected by the wall thickness and thin walled pipelines are more prone to failure it should be pointed out that when the wall thickness is greater than 10 mm the reduction of the dent depth is limited when increasing the wall thickness for example under the impact of a sphere of 3000 kg v 5 m s the dent depth for the pipeline with a wall thickness of 14 mm is approximately 70 mm and δ d is over 10 which is expected to cause pipeline leakage 4 4 concrete coating thickness submarine pipelines are always protected with a concrete coating for on bottom stability and mechanical protection to consider this effect a plastic damage model is employed to simulate the reinforced concrete coating shown in fig 24 the concrete strength parameters are in the common range for pipeline engineering under the impact by a sphere of 3000 kg the responses of pipelines with different concrete coating thicknesses are simulated the effect on pipeline dent depth is shown in fig 25 the dent depth decreases linearly with the increase in concrete coating thickness it is believed that the concrete coating can improve the pipeline resistance to impact loads and reduce the dent damage even so in some situations the dent damage is still relatively severe for example when the impact velocity is 5 m s a normalized dent depth of 0 12 66 mm is produced for a pipeline covered by a 100 mm thick concrete coating this is in agreement with the findings of yang et al 2011 that the protection from concrete coating alone is insufficient other measurements should be taken to lower the impact damage 4 5 internal pressure fig 26 gives the comparisons between the responses of pipelines under different internal pressures it is noticed that the pipelines are resting on a rigid bed the results of dent depth are depicted in fig 26 there is a declining trend of the dent depth with the increase in internal pressures which is more significant under higher impact velocities it seems that a higher internal pressure could make pipelines become stiffer requiring more impact energy to produce a specific dent depth compared to pipelines with lower pressures that is consistent with the research by zeinoddini et al 2013 who studied the pipeline response with various internal pressures under quasi static impact loads the deformed transverse profiles and longitudinal profiles for pipelines under different internal pressures are shown in fig 27 and fig 28 respectively it shows that the damage domain of pipeline dent is more localized and smaller when the internal pressure increases this may be explained by the enhancement in pipeline equivalent stiffness attributed to internal pressure zhang et al 2016 with the increase in internal pressure due to the enhanced stiffness more impact energy is stored in global elastic potential energy of pipeline which finally leads to a smaller and more localized dent damage 4 6 free span length due to scouring it is frequent that part of the pipeline segments is hanging which is likely to cause failure to give an insight into the failure mechanism suspended pipelines with various free span lengths are considered fig 29 depicts the effect of free span length on dent depth pipelines with longer free span length experience smaller dent depths when compared to those with short span length this difference is significant with the increase in impact velocity for example when the impact velocity is 3 m s the difference between normalized dent depths of pipelines with a free span length of 20 m and zero is 0 05 27 5 mm while when the impact velocity is 7 m s this difference becomes approximately the double vibrations of suspended pipelines will be generated during the impact process the longitudinal profile of the vibration amplitude of the pipeline top nodes with various free span lengths is shown in fig 30 it can be seen that for pipelines with longer free span length the impact process will trigger a broader and larger vibration the vibration amplitude is maximum at the impact area centre and gradually declines to both ends fig 31 shows the pipeline maximum vibration amplitude against the free span length maximum vibration amplitudes increase with the free span length it is pointed out that this gradually intensified vibration could increase the pipeline stress and aggravate the fatigue failure extent of pipelines which is likely to cause a yield failure lou and ming 2015 with the increase in free span length less vertical constraints are imposed on the pipelines it seems that more energy is dissipated in global vibration rather than the localized dent damage which indicates that the suspended pipelines are prone to yield and fatigue failure rather than a local rupture failure 4 7 seabed flexibility seabed flexibility is a key parameter for pipeline response subject to transient impact loads the response of pipelines resting on either flexible seabed with various soil properties or rigid seabed is investigated fig 32 shows the effect of seabed flexibility on pipeline depth it can be seen that pipelines resting on a rigid seabed are more vulnerable to impact damage as compared to those on a flexible seabed which is more convenient when the impact velocity is relatively high besides for pipelines resting on a flexible seabed soil properties undrained shear strength s u also influence the response it seems that with the increase in the undrained shear strength of soil seabed becomes stiffer and the interaction between soil and pipe is diminished thus most of the impact energy is converted to the unrecoverable plastic deformation of pipeline and a deeper dent is expected fig 33 gives the relationship between energy dissipation of seabed soil e s and soil properties it is noticed that for otherwise identical impact conditions e s is equal to the difference between internal energy of the pipeline resting on a rigid seabed and that on a flexible seabed the contribution of soil medium to energy dissipation is considerable under the impact by a sphere of 3000 kg v 3 m s energy dissipation of the flexible seabed s u 2 kpa is nearly 1900 kj indicating that approximately 14 of the total energy has been absorbed in the soil medium rather than in the pipeline plastic deflection besides with the decrease in undrained shear strength of soil medium more energy is absorbed fig 34 gives the longitudinal profile for lateral displacement of the impacted pipeline resting on a flexible seabed it should be noted that only the displacements of pipeline bottom nodes are depicted this figure further supports the explanation given above for pipelines resting on a flexible seabed part of the impact energy is dissipated through pipeline global lateral displacement and deformations which is significant for softer seabed these findings coincide with the research from zeinoddini et al 2013 who studied the effect of seabed flexibility on pipeline response 4 8 burial depth pipelines in high risk areas are usually buried under the seabed to reduce the impact damage trenching is an efficient method for pipeline protection in this section the effects of burial depth and the corresponding soil properties undrained shear strength s u on pipeline responses are investigated the curve of dent depths against various burial depth and soil properties under an identical impact energy sphere object m 3000 kg v 9 m s is plotted in fig 35 the results considering the sssr effects are compared with those that the effect is neglected it shows that the pipeline damage is overestimated without considering the sssr effects it seems that the clay is hardened and the strain rate effect is dominant this is consisted with the results from gao et al 2016 who simulated the anchor penetration on clay and found that the sssr effects significantly increase the soil strength therefore without a specific declaration the results shown in the following analysis include the sssr effects the results also show that there is a dramatic decline in pipeline local damage with the increase in burial depth it is believed that part of the impact energy will be absorbed by the soil medium before the pipeline is impacted which can provide a protective effect however for softer soil medium the contribution to pipeline protection is not appreciable as an example for a flexible seabed with s u 2 kpa the normalized dent depth is approximately 0 09 50 mm even though the burial depth is 2 m furthermore the effect of soil properties is not significant when the burial depth is relatively shallow with different soil properties the damage dents of buried pipelines differ slightly for burial depth less than 0 25 m it seems that under shallow buried conditions large deformation of soil medium is not triggered significantly thus the soil property is not the most important factor to cause pipeline deformation although with the increase in burial depth this effect becomes pronounced this phenomenon can be seen clearly in fig 36 which shows the relationship between dent depth and the soil properties with shallower burial depth the dent depth nearly keeps unchanged with the changes of undrained shear strength while with burial depth larger than 0 5 m the dent depth decreases and this declining trend is more significant for deeper burial depths for recently buried pipelines the backfill soil around the pipe is usually regarded as underconsolidated soil indicating a lower strength in this study it is considered that s u is 10 kpa to 14 kpa for the underconsolidated clay and 18 kpa for the homogenous clay respectively the results of different soil consolidation states are shown in fig 37 which shows that the safety burial depth for homogenous clay is 1 m while this depth increases to 1 5 m for the underconsolidated clay with s u of 10 kpa the obvious differences in safety burial depth are expected to affect the project cost therefore for newly buried pipelines the optimal design burial depth needs to be assessed carefully including considering the mechanical properties and consolidation state of the covering soil to quantify the effect of burial depth d and soil properties s u one simple fitting equation is proposed after trying several strategies bp neural network with strong ability in approximating functions of complex mechanisms zhang and barrion 2006 is employed to fit this equation based on total 45 simulation cases the correlation coefficient r and mean relative error mre is 0 977 and 5 37 which indicates a good correlation between the data and the function it should be noted that there are still more factors that should be considered in this function for example the steel yield strength pipeline diameter wall thickness impact energy object shapes friction coefficient among others in future work a larger number of cases should be simulated and fitted into the bp network to genrate a more robust and applicable approximation 6 δ d f d s u f 2 w 2 f 1 w 1

investigated experimentally and numerically in the current study a numerical model considering pipe soil interaction and able to simulate large soil deformation is established and has been validated against the experimental results after which an extensive parametric study is carried out the effects of a series of parameters on pipeline response are examined the conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the experimental results show that the pipeline dent depth increases with the release height and weight of the dropped object the ground conditions also influence the pipeline deformation response under an identical impact pipelines resting on sandy soil or buried under sandy cover experience smaller damage as compared to pipelines resting on a concrete ground 2 dent depth increases with the increase in impact velocity and weight of dropped objects and decreases with the increase in wall thickness concrete coating and internal pressure the local buckling becomes serious when the dropped object shape is sharper which should be considered as an ultimate condition 3 for suspended pipelines the dent depth decreases with the increase of the free span length while the global vibration becomes enlarged so the fatigue failure should be considered 4 the flexible seabed can dissipate part of the impact energy up to 14 through pipeline global lateral displacement and deformation with the decrease in soil strength the seabed becomes softer and a smaller dent depth up to reduce 25 of the dent depth is expected due to the increasing contribution to energy absorption 5 for buried pipelines the strain softening and strain rate effects should be considered otherwise the pipeline damage is overestimated the dent depth declines clearly with the increase in burial depth furthermore the effect of soil properties becomes pronounced when the burial depth is larger than 0 5 m those results take into account more factors such as the seabed flexibility soil properties and strain effect which are informative for the supplement to the specifications and give some reference to safety designs of submarine pipeline subjected to impact loads acknowledgements
