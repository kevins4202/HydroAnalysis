19295,to determine the priority hazard in drinking water disability adjusted life years dalys method was used to evaluate the disease burden induced by trihalomethanes thms and low level arsenic through multiple exposure routes based on the two year sampling from drinking water in xi an city northwest china the average concentrations of chloroform tcm bromodichloromethane bdcm dibromochloromethane dbcm bromoform tbm and arsenic were 12 67 μg l 1 42 μg l 0 60 μg l 0 13 μg l and 1 00 μg l respectively and the total lifetime cancer risks for all thms and arsenic were 8 54 10 6 and 4 02 10 5 which were 8 54 and 40 2 times of the negligible risk level 1 00 10 6 respectively the dalys estimation showed that the total dalys lost for all age groups was 32 62 person year and the average individual dalys lost was 4 77 10 6 per person year ppy which was 4 77 times of the reference level 1 00 10 6 ppy about 72 07 of the total disease burden was due to arsenic which was considered to be the priority hazard in xi an drinking water the age group of 75 80 years was found to be most vulnerable to the induced cancer risk and skin cancer had the highest disease burden 2 24 10 6 ppy due to the relatively high incidence rates of lung cancer and skin cancer most dalys lost for males were 2 4 times to that for females in the same age group oral ingestion made the most contribution 88 58 to the total disease burden followed by inhalation of thms 11 30 whereas dermal absorption showed negligible risk 0 12 as the first to compare the cancer risks of arsenic and thms to the public in dalys in china this study might be useful for potential strategies of risk control and management of hazardous agents in drinking water graphical abstract image 1 keywords arsenic cancer risk disability adjusted life years drinking water trihalomethane 1 introduction trihalomethanes thms and arsenic are two kinds of toxic chemicals commonly found in drinking water due to the low cost and convenience in usage chlorine is widely used in drinking water disinfection however an unexpected consequence of chlorination is the interaction with natural organic matter nom forming various disinfection by products dbps such as thms haloacetic acids haas and other undesirable compounds of these dbps thms including chloroform tcm bromodichloromethane bdcm dibromochloromethane dbcm and bromoform tbm are the major dbps and pose a significant threat to human health several epidemiological studies have reported that thms in drinking water will increase the incidence of bladder cancer villanueva et al 2007 and cause adverse reproductive and developmental outcomes graves et al 2001 due to the potential health risk associated with thms the maximum concentrations of 80 μg l and 100 μg l have been established by the united states environmental protection agency usepa usepa 2006 and the european union european economic community directive 1998 respectively arsenic usually comes from drinking water sources especially groundwater in inorganic form it is reported that millions of people worldwide are exposed to groundwater with arsenic exceeding the world health organization who safety standard of 10 μg l exposure to arsenic at high levels can cause severe human health problems cardiovascular diseases gastrointestinal vascular respiratory and neurological disorders adverse pregnancy effects and several cancers such as skin lung bladder kidney and liver cancers aballay et al 2012 bardach et al 2015 chen et al 2011 huang et al 2015 mohammed abdul et al 2015 saint jacques et al 2018 thakur and mondal 2017 wang et al 2014 for drinking water safety several technologies have been developed to remove arsenic effectively during water treatment such as co precipitation coagulation ion exchange adsorption and membrane filtration hao et al 2018 banerji and chaudhari 2016 zhu et al 2018 thus the arsenic in treated water is always at a low level 10 μg l for transportion by public water systems however recent studies show the potential toxicity of low level arsenic which should be of particular concern bulka et al 2016 monrad et al 2017 roh et al 2017 saint jacques et al 2018 susko et al 2017 to provide an important basis for controlling the risks of pollutants in drinking water health risk assessment hra has been widely used during the conventional hra the risk is usually expressed as a deterministic value or a probability of exceeding a standard neither can the severity duration and differences of the health impacts be accounted for nor can the occurrence of health damage be proved therefore the quantifiable indicators such as the disability adjusted life years dalys are recommended by the who to assess the health impacts caused by environmental risk factors dalys is a disease burden indicator combining the estimation of healthy life lost due to premature mortality and morbidity gao et al 2015 during the disease burden quantification different weights are given for different age groups and time periods to show the gap between the ideal health status and actual population health status many studies have been performed on the disease burden of pollutants in drinking water such as lead chatham stephens et al 2014 arsenic ling and liao 2007 dbps pan et al 2014 and microbial pathogens an et al 2012 machdar et al 2013 razzolini et al 2016 xiao et al 2012 however only a few publications dealing with the cancer risks of low level arsenic using dalys and the prioritization of hazards thms low level arsenic and other chemicals in drinking water is still not well understood in china zhang et al evaluated the health risk of arsenic in drinking water of major cities of china though dalys zhang et al 2017d although the average arsenic concentration was 0 53 μg l the overall cancer risk was higher than 1 00 10 6 per person year ppy but there is much controversy over the bladder and kidney cancer risks at this level of arsenic exposure therefore the main objective of this study is to estimate the cancer risks of low level arsenic via drinking water in dalys with the disease endpoints of lung cancer and skin cancer in addition since dbps in drinking water especially thms pose a significant threat to peoples health in china the cancer risk of thms through multiple exposure routes was estimated and compared with that of arsenic in dalys based on a two year sampling in xi an drinking water distribution system dwds xi an is the largest city in northwest china and chlorine is used for drinking water disinfection this work will be useful in risk control and management of hazardous agents in drinking water 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling strategy xi an is the capital of shaanxi province it has an urban area of 9983 km2 and a population of 8 71 million pan et al 2017 the total water demand is approximately 1 100 000 m3 d which is supplied by six water treatment plants wtps with groundwater from intakes in bahe chanhe weihe fenghe and zaohe and surface water from jinpen reservior as the feed sources the daily production of four groundwater wtps is 130 000 200 000 m3 while that of the other two wtps with surface water is 710 000 900 000 m3 zhang et al 2017b groundwater is untreated prior to chlorination in contact tanks in the no 2 no 3 no 4 and no 5 wtps and surface water is treated by chemical flocculation settling and sand filtration prior to entering the chlorine contact tanks in qujiang and nanjiao wtps the produced water from both sources is transported through a single dwds with a total length of 1493 km the dwds is principally made of six different pipe materials gray cast iron 66 steel 11 ductile iron 10 unplasticised polyvinyl chloride upvc 6 concrete 4 and polyethylene pe 3 there is a great age diversity in the dwds as well more than 40 of pipes was built over 50 years ago water samples were collected monthly from fifteen locations s1 s15 shown in fig 1 in xi an dwds between jan 2015 and dec 2016 to select the sampling points the hydraulic analysis was performed using a windows based computer program previously developed by the corresponding author based on the basic information of the dwds network topology water supply volumes and pressures of the six wtps pipe lengths diameters roughness values node elevations valve locations and states etc mass and energy conservation and fixed point iteration method the nodal pressures pipe flow rates and directions could be determined zhang et al 2017a thus the water supply zoning was obtained by combining the calculation results and locations of closed valves the distances from the wtps were taken into consideration as well moreover the selection scheme was consulted with the staff in xi an water industry operation co ltd samples were collected generally between 9 a m and 5 p m from the faucet of selected washrooms near the street before sampling the faucet was turned on and allowed to run for about 5 min to obtain water from the public distribution system the samples for thms and arsenic analysis were collected in cleaned glass vials and polyethylene bottles respectively to stop further formation of thms ascorbic acid was added beforehand to the vials for thms analysis all samples were stored in dark at 4 c and transported to the laboratory for analysis within 24 h 2 2 sample analysis the reagents were at least of analytical grade except as noted all solutions were prepared by using high purity water with the conductivity of 18 2 mω cm from a milli q system millipore milford ma usa the samples were determined in triplicate and the average values were used for data analysis thms were analyzed using a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer gc ms 7890b 5977a agilent usa equipped with a db 624 capillary column 60 m 0 32 mm 1 80 μm and an electron capture detector ecd after liquid liquid extraction by methyl tert butyl ether the detailed thms analysis could be available by referring to usepa method 551 1 emmert et al 2007 the limit of detection lod was determined to be 0 1 μg l for each thm the concentrations of total arsenic were measured according to the standard methods of water and wastewater examinations using a hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometer system hg afs with an afs 9230 spectrometer beijing titan instruments co beijing china rice and bridgewater 2012 tang et al 2013 the optimized afs instrumental parameters were as follows lamp current 60 ma negative high voltage of photomultiplier 270 v carrier shield argon flow 400 800 ml min and atomizer height 8 mm the arsenic calibration curve showed good linearity r 0 999 the lod for arsenic was 0 1 μg l all analyses were performed at the china urban water quality monitoring laboratories in xi an which is a standardized laboratory for water quality analysis in china 2 3 exposure assessment of thms and arsenic humans are potentially exposed to thms and arsenic from drinking water through oral ingestion dermal absorption and inhalation usepa 1989 2005 for thms all three exposure pathways were considered because thms are volatile organic compounds and the health risks from inhalation and dermal exposures during regular indoor activities cannot be ignored due to the lack of some toxicological data of arsenic such as inhalation reference dose and transfer efficiency from water to air inhalation exposure was not included in arsenic health risk assessment chronic daily intake cdi for each exposure route was calculated according to the following equations basu et al 2011 hosseini koupaie and eskicioglu 2015 legay et al 2011 1 cdi oral c w ir w ef ed bw at 2 cdi dermal c w sa f pc et ef ed 10 3 bw at 3 cdi

environment of the people s republic of china moeprc 2013 pan et al 2014 zhang et al 2017a 2017c to calculate the cdi values of thms and arsenic for each exposure pathway the probabilistic risk analysis was conducted through monte carlo simulation 10 000 iterations using crystal ball 11 1 oracle inc usa the parameters specific to population characteristics in xi an city such as ed bw and et were selected to reduce the assessment uncertainty 2 4 lifetime cancer risk assessment of thms the lifetime cancer risk of each thm through a specific exposure route was evaluated by incorporating cdi values and slope factors the total cancer risk crt is defined as the sum of cancer risks crs from different exposure pathways the equations for calculating crt and cr in a specific exposure route are as follows usepa 1989 2005 9 c r oral cd i oral p f oral 10 c r dermal cdi dermal p f dermal 11 c r inhalation cdi inhalation p f inhalation 12 c r t c r oral c r dermal c r inhalation where croral crdermal and crinhalation are cancer risk through oral ingestion dermal absorption and inhalation respectively dimensionless pforal pfdermal and pfinhalation are slope factors of the chemical from three exposure pathways mg kg day 1 slope factors of different thm species were obtained from the integrated risk information system iris iris 2009 and the risk assessment information system rais rais 2009 however due to the debate of the carcinogenic effects of tcm the slope factor of tcm was removed from iris and a reference dose rfd of 0 01 mg kg day was determined to protect humans against cancer risk in this paper the maximum cdi for tcm was 0 0018 mg kg day which was much smaller than the rfd as a result tcm was not considered to be a possible carcinogen and cancer risk analyses were performed on other three thms bdcm dbcm and tbm the summary of slope factors found for the three compounds is presented in table s2 monte carlo simulation 10 000 iterations with crystal ball 11 1 oracle inc usa was carried out to estimate the lifetime cancer risks of bdcm dbcm and tbm for each exposure pathway the input parameters in table s1 were used in the analysis as well 2 5 cancer incidence rates associated with arsenic to estimate the risk of lung cancer and skin cancer induced by arsenic in drinking water separately the mathematical models proposed by the national research council nrc in canada and usepa were used the estimation of the incidence rate of lung cancer was based on the model proposed by the nrc shown in eq 13 13 h x d k q 1 d q 2 d 2 x m k 1 h x m where h x d is cancer incidence rate x is age year d is exposure dose μg kg day h is heaviside function dimensionless h x m 0 if x m h x m 1 if x m q 1 q 2 k and m are nonnegative parameters dimensionless which are shown in table s3 the prevalence rate of skin cancer was calculated according to the dose response relationship proposed by the usepa usepa 1988 14 p x d 1 exp q 1 d q 2 d 2 x m k h x m where p x d is prevalence rate of skin cancer dimensionless the meanings of other parameters are the same with that in eq 13 the values of q 1 q 2 k and m are summarized in table s3 the prevalence rate of skin cancer should be converted into the incidence rate based on the following equation zhang et al 2017d 15 h ln 1 p x d 1 p x t d where h is incidence rate of skin cancer at age stage between x and x t 2 6 disease model and daly estimation due to the absence of definite evidence for low level arsenic exposure and bladder and kidney cancers lung and skin cancers are considered to be the disease endpoints of low level arsenic in this study similarly as the association between bladder cancer and chlorinated drinking water has been uncovered by epidemiologic studies the disease endpoint of thms is bladder cancer to assess the disease burden of thms and low level arsenic in drinking water the values of dalys lost were estimated by combining the cancer incidence rates and a two stage disease model shown in fig s1 in this model the mortality burden and morbidity burden should be considered and they are measured in terms of years of life lost ylls and years of lived with disability ylds respectively dalys is the combination of ylls and ylds the calculation formulas are shown as eqs 16 18 soerjomataram et al 2012 16 dalys ylls ylds 17 ylls x n x p x 1 s x e x t d 18 ylds x n x p x 1 s

rate survival rate and standard life expectancy respectively t d is time to death y is disease phase dw is disability weight l is duration p seq is proportion of the sequelae dwseq is disability weight of the sequelae t c is time to cure the details for calculating the parameters in the disease model and dalys estimation are illustrated below 1 p x for bladder cancer induced by thms the total cancer risk crt should be converted into the annual value by being calculated as p x crt rs x sp x where rs x is age specific relative sensitivity and sp x is age span for each age group 1 and 4 for 0 1 and 1 5 age groups and 5 for others the age specific relative sensitivity rs x means the ratio of the age specific incidence rates of bladder cancer to the total incidence rate which was computed based on the corresponding data reported in cancer registration areas of china in 2009 wen et al 2013 as shown in fig s2 for lung and skin cancers induced by arsenic p x can be estimated according to eqs 13 and 14 respectively 2 s x for bladder cancer and lung cancer s x was estimated as s x 1 m i where m and i are cancer mortality and incidence respectively pan et al 2014 age specific incidence rates and mortality rates for the two cancers reported in cancer registration areas of china in 2009 were used for computation chen et al 2013 wen et al 2013 as shown in fig s3 due to the lack of data on skin cancer in china the mortality rate in another study byd et al 1996 was used in this paper for calculating s x which was 0 9 for all age groups 3 l and dw the duration and disability weights of each disease phase are summarized in table s4 murray and lopez 1996 småstuen et al 2008 stouthard et al 1997 the public health group 2005 the median values of time to death t d of bladder lung and skin cancers were 2 193 years 0 833 years and 1 003 year respectively the median values of time to cure t c of bladder lung and skin cancers were 4 00 years 6 00 years and 5 00 years respectively 4 others the values of standard life expectancy e x for males and females were 80 years and 82 5 years respectively murray 1994 population size at age class was based on xi an population structure in 2015 xi an municipal bureau of statistics 2016 due to limited data available only a set of disabling sequelae could be obtained soerjomataram et al 2012 in this paper the sequelae among bladder cancer survivors were included such as incontinence impotence primary infertility and secondary infertility table s5 presents the proportions and disability weights of the sequelae murray and lopez 1996 stouthard et al 1997 soerjomataram et al 2012 the public health group 2005 3 results and discussion 3 1 concentrations of thms and arsenic in drinking water the concentrations of four thms and arsenic in the water samples are given in table 1 the levels of tcm bdcm dbcm tbm and arsenic were ranged from below the detection limits to 52 50 μg l mean 12 67 μg l to 12 80 μg l mean 1 42 μg l to 8 50 μg l mean 0 60 μg l and to 5 30 μg l mean 0 13 μg l to 9 59 μg l mean 1 00 μg l respectively the concentrations of the studied chemicals in all samples were below the chinese guideline values 60 μg l 60 μg l 100 μg l 100 μg l and 10 μg l for tcm bdcm dbcm tbm and arsenic respectively and at the acceptable levels the concentrations of thms were lower than that in canada legay et al 2011 the united states krasner et al 2006 korea kim 2009 turkey uyak 2006 hongkong lee et al 2004 and india basu et al 2011 while a little higher than those in thailand pentamwa et al 2013 variations in raw water quality and treatment systems may explain the different values of thms around the world for arsenic the levels in xi an city were comparable with that in denmark baastrup et al 2008 and the united states bulka et al 2016 as illustrated in table 1 the average concentrations of the chemicals followed the order tcm bdcm arsenic dbcm tbm tcm and bdcm were the two dominant thm species in all samples which on average accounted for 85 49 and 9 58 to the total thms respectively the contribution sequence of thms was consistent with those reported in australia summerhayes et al 2011 malaysia abdullah et al 2003 korea kim 2009 and canada legay et al 2011 the main reason for larger proportion of tcm may be that compared to bromide ion chlorine has higher reaction rates with thms precursors kumari and gupta 2018 the distributions of thms and arsenic are shown in fig 2 where the five compounds had different distribution characteristics the concentrations of tcm were best fitted with a logistic distribution and that of bdcm and arsenic were best fitted with logarithmic normal distributions other two species of thms dbcm and tbm were best fitted with weibull distributions the resulting distribution parameters are shown in table 1 as well the difference of the probability distributions may be associated with the raw water quality chemical characteristics and interactions water treatment process corrosion products water residence time hydraulic characteristics pipe characteristics and nature of water supply infrastructure andra et al 2014 golea et al 2017 kim et al 2011 3 2 cancer risks induced by thms and arsenic according to eqs 1 3 the chronic daily intakes cdi values of thms and arsenic were calculated using the fitted distributions of the input variables shown in table 1 and table s1 then the evaluation of the lifetime cancer risks induced by thms was carried out using monte carlo simulation based on eqs 9 12 the results are shown in table 2 the mean and 95th percentile values of total lifetime cancer risk for the three thms were 8 54 10 6 and 2 77 10 5 respectively which were higher than the minimum or negligible risk level set by usepa 1 00 10 6 usepa 1989 for the average exposure scenario bdcm made the largest contribution to the total cancer risk 60 77 followed by dbcm 38 52 and tbm 0 71 however the contribution sequence was changed under higher exposure scenario dbcm 54 13 bdcm 44 77 tbm 1 10 oral ingestion was found to be the most prominent exposure pathway mean 5 06 10 6 followed by inhalation mean 3 44 10 6 whereas dermal absorption showed negligible risk mean 2 22 10 8 the lifetime cancer risk of thms for females was higher than that for males through oral ingestion and dermal absorption the mean values of total oral and dermal cancer risk for females were 8 04 13 54 and 14 65 higher than that for males due to higher inhalation rate males had higher thms cancer risk mean 3 33 10 6 through inhalation than females mean 3 28 10 6 for arsenic the cancer risks incidence rates of lung cancer and skin cancer were estimated based on the mean and 95th percentile cdi values and eqs 13 15 the age specific incidence rates of the two cancers under the average cdi values are presented in fig 3 and the cancer risks induced by arsenic are shown in table 3 although the arsenic concentrations were always at a low level 10 μg l the mean value of total lifetime cancer risk for arsenic was 4 02 10 5 which were 40 2 times of the negligible risk level 1 00 10 6 the skin cancer risk mean 3 67 10 5 was found to be much higher than the lung cancer risk mean 3 54 10 6 and the largest difference was recorded for females where the mean risk value of skin cancer was five orders of magnitude higher than that of lung cancer more than 99 of the cancer risk was from oral ingestion while dermal absorption had a little contribution 1 males suffer higher risk than females for both cancers actually the average risk level of lung cancer for males was higher than that of females by four to eight orders of magnitude as illustrated in fig 3 amongst different age groups 85 and over years was most vulnerable to the lung and skin cancer risks which was mainly attributed to the highest exposure duration moreover with the increase of age peoples may be more susceptible to the detrimental effects of contaminant exposure 3 3 dalys estimation for low level arsenic and thms to evaluate the disease burden of three thms and low level arsenic in drinking water the age specific lost of dalys ylls and ylds was calculated based on the mean values of the total cancer risks due to the studied hazards the results are illustrated in fig 4 the dalys lost was highest for the age group of 75 80 years 4 30 person year followed by 70 75 years 3 76 person year while it was lowest for 0 1 years 0 person year this may be attributed to the population numbers cancer incidence rates and survival rates for different age groups the total dalys estimation for all age groups was 32 62 person year and the average individual dalys lost was 4 77 10 6 per person year ppy which was 4 77 times of the reference risk level defined by the who 1 00 10 6 ppy who 2011 moreover the total ylls and ylds for all age groups were 30 76 person year and 1 86 person year respectively revealing that the mortality burden made the much higher contribution 94 30 to the total disease burden than the morbidity burden 5 70 similar to the distribution of dalys lost the highest mortality burden ylls lost was recorded in the 75 80 years age group 4 08 person year and the lowest value 0 person year occurred in the age groups of 0 1 years and 1 5 years however the distribution of morbidity burden ylds lost was different from that of dalys and ylls lost the age group of 60 65 years had the highest ylds lost 0 26 person year while 0 1 years had the lowest lost of 0 person year the different characteristics in bladder lung and skin cancers may be the main reason for the different distributions including disease duration disability weight and proportion of the sequelae in addition peoples lifestyle and health status of different age groups may affect the distribution of total disease burden fig 5 presents the age specific lost of dalys ylls and ylds for different cancers the total dalys lost for all age groups followed the order skin cancer 15 32 person year bladder cancer 9 11 person year lung cancer 8 19 person year resulting in the same sequence of the average individual dalys lost skin cancer 2 24 10 6 ppy bladder cancer 1 33 10 6 ppy lung cancer 1 20 10 6 ppy the average individual dalys lost of each disease was higher than the reference risk level of 1 00 10 6 ppy lung cancer and skin cancer were associated with low level arsenic in drinking water and their dalys lost was 72 07 of the total disease burden comparatively the dalys lost of bladder cancer which was mainly induced by thms made less contribution 27 93 to the total disease burden therefore arsenic was the priority hazard in xi an drinking water although the exposure to arsenic was lower than that to thms out of all the diseases studied skin cancer was found to have the highest value of total ylls lost 14 80 person year followed by lung cancer 8 06 person year and bladder cancer 7 91 person year however the contribution of the three cancers to ylds lost followed the order bladder cancer 64 52 skin cancer 27 96 lung cancer 7 52 the main reason may be that bladder cancer had relatively high survival rate and possible sequela among survivors fernández et al 2009 furthermore for the age groups of 70 years the highest disease burden was recorded in skin cancer while for 70 years age groups that was recorded in bladder cancer the highest dalys lost of the three cancers appeared in different age groups 55 60 years for skin cancer and 75 80 years for bladder and lung cancers to find out the disease burden distributions in males and females their lost of dalys ylls and ylds at specific age were calculated as shown in fig 6 the total dalys lost for males 23 22 person year was much higher than that for females 8 03 person year the same conclusion could be drawn for total ylls and ylds lost the average individual dalys lost for males and females were 6 63 10 6 ppy and 2 40 10 6 ppy respectively as illustrated both males and females had the highest disease burden at the age between 75 and 80 with the dalys estimation of 2 75 person year and 1 29 person year respectively for the age groups of 10 years males suffered much more dalys lost than females in fact most dalys for males were 2 10 times to that for females in the same age group the main reason may be that males had larger population number and much higher cancer incidence rate especially for skin cancer and lung cancer in addition different physiological characteristics and lifestyle in males and females may influence their susceptibility to the detrimental effects of contaminant exposure 3 4 comparison of the disease burden through different exposure routes the disease burden caused by thms and low level arsenic via different exposure routes are summarized in table 4 the average individual dalys lost for bdcm dbcm tbm and arsenic were 8 04 10 7 ppy 5 15 10 7 ppy 8 84 10 9 ppy and 3 40 10 6 ppy respectively as mentioned above despite of much lower concentrations and exposure doses the disease burden from arsenic in xi an drinking water was 3 40 times of the reference level 1 00 10 6 ppy the dalys estimation for different hazards followed the order arsenic bdcm dbcm tbm which was consistent with the order of the mean values of total cancer risk due to the relatively high toxicity low level arsenic in drinking water made the highest contribution to the total disease burden therefore compared thms arsenic should be of priority control to reduce the cancer risk of drinking water in xi an city moreover oral ingestion made the most contribution 88 58 to the total disease burden followed by inhalation of thms 11 30 whereas dermal absorption showed negligible risk 0 12 for arsenic the average individual dalys lost through dermal absorption was lower than the corresponding value through oral ingestion by four orders of magnitude this is because that arsenic mainly enters into the human body through food and drinking water while very little intake through the skin by contact with water for the three thms the average individual dalys lost via oral ingestion was comparable to that via inhalation while the dermal disease burden was two orders of magnitude lower than that from the other two pathways thus besides oral ingestion inhalation exposure to volatile thms was an important route for the cancer risk which was in agreement with other studies basu et al 2011 pan et al 2014 the inhalation contribution for the three thms followed the order bdcm 44 90 dbcm 33 59 tbm 15 72 which was in accordance with the order of their concentrations in drinking water 3 5 uncertainty analysis there were still some limitations and uncertainties in the risk assessment based on dalys in this study first uncertainties could come from the models proposed by the usepa and nrc these models were based on the epidemiological data in taiwan with high level arsenic exposure which may give rise to the issue of predictive validity for the application on low level arsenic in drinking water due to limited knowledge and data the reasonable dose response relationship for estimating the cancer risk induced by low level arsenic has not been well understood so the calculation results for arsenic based on the linear extrapolation of the adopted models may be quite different from the real cancer risk in xi an where the low level exposure of arsenic from drinking water was observed second the habits and patterns of water consumption among chinese people are different from people in taiwan or other areas around the world most people in china drink boiled water where the thms concentrations are reduced significantly thus the associated risk from oral ingestion of thms is reduced greatly as well in this study tcm was not included in the cancer risk assessment of thms however some authorities still have the slope factors for tcm krasner and wright 2005 so further studies should be carried out to evaluate the tcm toxicity and provide a unified method for risk assessment some parameter values in this study were obtained from the recommended values of usepa or previous studies such as ingestion rate irw and inhalation rate ira which may not be specific for the residents in xi an city in addition with consideration of the spatial and temporal variations in contaminant concentrations more extensive survey is needed to support their probability distributions which greatly affect the risk assessment although the duration l and disability weights dw of each disease stage were obtained from other studies the dalys results are proved to be stable the variability of dalys method mainly comes from epidemiological data other than l and dw therefore the uncertainties of l and dw during the calculation of dalys lost were not considered in this paper 4 conclusion to find out the priority hazard in drinking water an estimation of the cancer risks from thms and low level arsenic was performed using dalys method based on a two year sampling in xi an city northwest china major conclusions are drawn as follows the average concentrations of tcm bdcm dbcm tbm and arsenic in drinking water were 12 67 μg l 1 42 μg l 0 60 μg l 0 13 μg l and 1 00 μg l respectively which are always at the acceptable levels the contaminant concentrations showed different probability distributions logistic distribution for tcm logarithmic normal distribution for bdcm and arsenic and weibull distribution for dbcm and tbm the mean values of total lifetime cancer risk for all thms and arsenic were 8 54 10 6 and 4 02 10 5 which were 8 54 and 40 2 times of the negligible risk level 1 00 10 6 respectively females are found to have higher cancer risks of thms through oral ingestion and dermal absorption while males suffer higher risk of arsenic through all pathways and thms through inhalation the total dalys estimation for all age groups was 32 62 person year and the average individual dalys lost was 4 77 10 6 per person year ppy which was 4 77 times of the reference risk level defined by the who 1 00 10 6 ppy the dalys lost was highest for the age group of 75 80 years 4 30 person year out of the diseases studied skin cancer had the highest disease burden of 2 24 10 6 ppy followed by bladder cancer 1 33 10 6 ppy and lung cancer 1 20 10 6 ppy approximately 72 07 of the total disease burden was due to arsenic which was considered to be the priority hazard in xi an drinking water the average individual dalys lost for males and females were 6 63 10 6 ppy and 2 40 10 6 ppy respectively both males and females had the highest disease burden at the age between 75 and 80 with the dalys estimation of 2 75 person year and 1 29 person year respectively although females had higher incidence of bladder cancer most dalys lost for males were 2 4 times to that for females in the same age group oral ingestion made the most contribution 88 58 to the total disease burden followed by inhalation of thms 11 30 whereas dermal absorption showed negligible risk 0 12 dalys is a useful method to determine the prioritization of hazardous chemicals in drinking water this study was the first to assess and compare disease burden caused by thms and low level arsenic to the public in china more comprehensive assessment considering other important hazards e g cryptosporidium bromate and lead in drinking

19295,to determine the priority hazard in drinking water disability adjusted life years dalys method was used to evaluate the disease burden induced by trihalomethanes thms and low level arsenic through multiple exposure routes based on the two year sampling from drinking water in xi an city northwest china the average concentrations of chloroform tcm bromodichloromethane bdcm dibromochloromethane dbcm bromoform tbm and arsenic were 12 67 μg l 1 42 μg l 0 60 μg l 0 13 μg l and 1 00 μg l respectively and the total lifetime cancer risks for all thms and arsenic were 8 54 10 6 and 4 02 10 5 which were 8 54 and 40 2 times of the negligible risk level 1 00 10 6 respectively the dalys estimation showed that the total dalys lost for all age groups was 32 62 person year and the average individual dalys lost was 4 77 10 6 per person year ppy which was 4 77 times of the reference level 1 00 10 6 ppy about 72 07 of the total disease burden was due to arsenic which was considered to be the priority hazard in xi an drinking water the age group of 75 80 years was found to be most vulnerable to the induced cancer risk and skin cancer had the highest disease burden 2 24 10 6 ppy due to the relatively high incidence rates of lung cancer and skin cancer most dalys lost for males were 2 4 times to that for females in the same age group oral ingestion made the most contribution 88 58 to the total disease burden followed by inhalation of thms 11 30 whereas dermal absorption showed negligible risk 0 12 as the first to compare the cancer risks of arsenic and thms to the public in dalys in china this study might be useful for potential strategies of risk control and management of hazardous agents in drinking water graphical abstract image 1 keywords arsenic cancer risk disability adjusted life years drinking water trihalomethane 1 introduction trihalomethanes thms and arsenic are two kinds of toxic chemicals commonly found in drinking water due to the low cost and convenience in usage chlorine is widely used in drinking water disinfection however an unexpected consequence of chlorination is the interaction with natural organic matter nom forming various disinfection by products dbps such as thms haloacetic acids haas and other undesirable compounds of these dbps thms including chloroform tcm bromodichloromethane bdcm dibromochloromethane dbcm and bromoform tbm are the major dbps and pose a significant threat to human health several epidemiological studies have reported that thms in drinking water will increase the incidence of bladder cancer villanueva et al 2007 and cause adverse reproductive and developmental outcomes graves et al 2001 due to the potential health risk associated with thms the maximum concentrations of 80 μg l and 100 μg l have been established by the united states environmental protection agency usepa usepa 2006 and the european union european economic community directive 1998 respectively arsenic usually comes from drinking water sources especially groundwater in inorganic form it is reported that millions of people worldwide are exposed to groundwater with arsenic exceeding the world health organization who safety standard of 10 μg l exposure to arsenic at high levels can cause severe human health problems cardiovascular diseases gastrointestinal vascular respiratory and neurological disorders adverse pregnancy effects and several cancers such as skin lung bladder kidney and liver cancers aballay et al 2012 bardach et al 2015 chen et al 2011 huang et al 2015 mohammed abdul et al 2015 saint jacques et al 2018 thakur and mondal 2017 wang et al 2014 for drinking water safety several technologies have been developed to remove arsenic effectively during water treatment such as co precipitation coagulation ion exchange adsorption and membrane filtration hao et al 2018 banerji and chaudhari 2016 zhu et al 2018 thus the arsenic in treated water is always at a low level 10 μg l for transportion by public water systems however recent studies show the potential toxicity of low level arsenic which should be of particular concern bulka et al 2016 monrad et al 2017 roh et al 2017 saint jacques et al 2018 susko et al 2017 to provide an important basis for controlling the risks of pollutants in drinking water health risk assessment hra has been widely used during the conventional hra the risk is usually expressed as a deterministic value or a probability of exceeding a standard neither can the severity duration and differences of the health impacts be accounted for nor can the occurrence of health damage be proved therefore the quantifiable indicators such as the disability adjusted life years dalys are recommended by the who to assess the health impacts caused by environmental risk factors dalys is a disease burden indicator combining the estimation of healthy life lost due to premature mortality and morbidity gao et al 2015 during the disease burden quantification different weights are given for different age groups and time periods to show the gap between the ideal health status and actual population health status many studies have been performed on the disease burden of pollutants in drinking water such as lead chatham stephens et al 2014 arsenic ling and liao 2007 dbps pan et al 2014 and microbial pathogens an et al 2012 machdar et al 2013 razzolini et al 2016 xiao et al 2012 however only a few publications dealing with the cancer risks of low level arsenic using dalys and the prioritization of hazards thms low level arsenic and other chemicals in drinking water is still not well understood in china zhang et al evaluated the health risk of arsenic in drinking water of major cities of china though dalys zhang et al 2017d although the average arsenic concentration was 0 53 μg l the overall cancer risk was higher than 1 00 10 6 per person year ppy but there is much controversy over the bladder and kidney cancer risks at this level of arsenic exposure therefore the main objective of this study is to estimate the cancer risks of low level arsenic via drinking water in dalys with the disease endpoints of lung cancer and skin cancer in addition since dbps in drinking water especially thms pose a significant threat to peoples health in china the cancer risk of thms through multiple exposure routes was estimated and compared with that of arsenic in dalys based on a two year sampling in xi an drinking water distribution system dwds xi an is the largest city in northwest china and chlorine is used for drinking water disinfection this work will be useful in risk control and management of hazardous agents in drinking water 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling strategy xi an is the capital of shaanxi province it has an urban area of 9983 km2 and a population of 8 71 million pan et al 2017 the total water demand is approximately 1 100 000 m3 d which is supplied by six water treatment plants wtps with groundwater from intakes in bahe chanhe weihe fenghe and zaohe and surface water from jinpen reservior as the feed sources the daily production of four groundwater wtps is 130 000 200 000 m3 while that of the other two wtps with surface water is 710 000 900 000 m3 zhang et al 2017b groundwater is untreated prior to chlorination in contact tanks in the no 2 no 3 no 4 and no 5 wtps and surface water is treated by chemical flocculation settling and sand filtration prior to entering the chlorine contact tanks in qujiang and nanjiao wtps the produced water from both sources is transported through a single dwds with a total length of 1493 km the dwds is principally made of six different pipe materials gray cast iron 66 steel 11 ductile iron 10 unplasticised polyvinyl chloride upvc 6 concrete 4 and polyethylene pe 3 there is a great age diversity in the dwds as well more than 40 of pipes was built over 50 years ago water samples were collected monthly from fifteen locations s1 s15 shown in fig 1 in xi an dwds between jan 2015 and dec 2016 to select the sampling points the hydraulic analysis was performed using a windows based computer program previously developed by the corresponding author based on the basic information of the dwds network topology water supply volumes and pressures of the six wtps pipe lengths diameters roughness values node elevations valve locations and states etc mass and energy conservation and fixed point iteration method the nodal pressures pipe flow rates and directions could be determined zhang et al 2017a thus the water supply zoning was obtained by combining the calculation results and locations of closed valves the distances from the wtps were taken into consideration as well moreover the selection scheme was consulted with the staff in xi an water industry operation co ltd samples were collected generally between 9 a m and 5 p m from the faucet of selected washrooms near the street before sampling the faucet was turned on and allowed to run for about 5 min to obtain water from the public distribution system the samples for thms and arsenic analysis were collected in cleaned glass vials and polyethylene bottles respectively to stop further formation of thms ascorbic acid was added beforehand to the vials for thms analysis all samples were stored in dark at 4 c and transported to the laboratory for analysis within 24 h 2 2 sample analysis the reagents were at least of analytical grade except as noted all solutions were prepared by using high purity water with the conductivity of 18 2 mω cm from a milli q system millipore milford ma usa the samples were determined in triplicate and the average values were used for data analysis thms were analyzed using a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer gc ms 7890b 5977a agilent usa equipped with a db 624 capillary column 60 m 0 32 mm 1 80 μm and an electron capture detector ecd after liquid liquid extraction by methyl tert butyl ether the detailed thms analysis could be available by referring to usepa method 551 1 emmert et al 2007 the limit of detection lod was determined to be 0 1 μg l for each thm the concentrations of total arsenic were measured according to the standard methods of water and wastewater examinations using a hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometer system hg afs with an afs 9230 spectrometer beijing titan instruments co beijing china rice and bridgewater 2012 tang et al 2013 the optimized afs instrumental parameters were as follows lamp current 60 ma negative high voltage of photomultiplier 270 v carrier shield argon flow 400 800 ml min and atomizer height 8 mm the arsenic calibration curve showed good linearity r 0 999 the lod for arsenic was 0 1 μg l all analyses were performed at the china urban water quality monitoring laboratories in xi an which is a standardized laboratory for water quality analysis in china 2 3 exposure assessment of thms and arsenic humans are potentially exposed to thms and arsenic from drinking water through oral ingestion dermal absorption and inhalation usepa 1989 2005 for thms all three exposure pathways were considered because thms are volatile organic compounds and the health risks from inhalation and dermal exposures during regular indoor activities cannot be ignored due to the lack of some toxicological data of arsenic such as inhalation reference dose and transfer efficiency from water to air inhalation exposure was not included in arsenic health risk assessment chronic daily intake cdi for each exposure route was calculated according to the following equations basu et al 2011 hosseini koupaie and eskicioglu 2015 legay et al 2011 1 cdi oral c w ir w ef ed bw at 2 cdi dermal c w sa f pc et ef ed 10 3 bw at 3 cdi

environment of the people s republic of china moeprc 2013 pan et al 2014 zhang et al 2017a 2017c to calculate the cdi values of thms and arsenic for each exposure pathway the probabilistic risk analysis was conducted through monte carlo simulation 10 000 iterations using crystal ball 11 1 oracle inc usa the parameters specific to population characteristics in xi an city such as ed bw and et were selected to reduce the assessment uncertainty 2 4 lifetime cancer risk assessment of thms the lifetime cancer risk of each thm through a specific exposure route was evaluated by incorporating cdi values and slope factors the total cancer risk crt is defined as the sum of cancer risks crs from different exposure pathways the equations for calculating crt and cr in a specific exposure route are as follows usepa 1989 2005 9 c r oral cd i oral p f oral 10 c r dermal cdi dermal p f dermal 11 c r inhalation cdi inhalation p f inhalation 12 c r t c r oral c r dermal c r inhalation where croral crdermal and crinhalation are cancer risk through oral ingestion dermal absorption and inhalation respectively dimensionless pforal pfdermal and pfinhalation are slope factors of the chemical from three exposure pathways mg kg day 1 slope factors of different thm species were obtained from the integrated risk information system iris iris 2009 and the risk assessment information system rais rais 2009 however due to the debate of the carcinogenic effects of tcm the slope factor of tcm was removed from iris and a reference dose rfd of 0 01 mg kg day was determined to protect humans against cancer risk in this paper the maximum cdi for tcm was 0 0018 mg kg day which was much smaller than the rfd as a result tcm was not considered to be a possible carcinogen and cancer risk analyses were performed on other three thms bdcm dbcm and tbm the summary of slope factors found for the three compounds is presented in table s2 monte carlo simulation 10 000 iterations with crystal ball 11 1 oracle inc usa was carried out to estimate the lifetime cancer risks of bdcm dbcm and tbm for each exposure pathway the input parameters in table s1 were used in the analysis as well 2 5 cancer incidence rates associated with arsenic to estimate the risk of lung cancer and skin cancer induced by arsenic in drinking water separately the mathematical models proposed by the national research council nrc in canada and usepa were used the estimation of the incidence rate of lung cancer was based on the model proposed by the nrc shown in eq 13 13 h x d k q 1 d q 2 d 2 x m k 1 h x m where h x d is cancer incidence rate x is age year d is exposure dose μg kg day h is heaviside function dimensionless h x m 0 if x m h x m 1 if x m q 1 q 2 k and m are nonnegative parameters dimensionless which are shown in table s3 the prevalence rate of skin cancer was calculated according to the dose response relationship proposed by the usepa usepa 1988 14 p x d 1 exp q 1 d q 2 d 2 x m k h x m where p x d is prevalence rate of skin cancer dimensionless the meanings of other parameters are the same with that in eq 13 the values of q 1 q 2 k and m are summarized in table s3 the prevalence rate of skin cancer should be converted into the incidence rate based on the following equation zhang et al 2017d 15 h ln 1 p x d 1 p x t d where h is incidence rate of skin cancer at age stage between x and x t 2 6 disease model and daly estimation due to the absence of definite evidence for low level arsenic exposure and bladder and kidney cancers lung and skin cancers are considered to be the disease endpoints of low level arsenic in this study similarly as the association between bladder cancer and chlorinated drinking water has been uncovered by epidemiologic studies the disease endpoint of thms is bladder cancer to assess the disease burden of thms and low level arsenic in drinking water the values of dalys lost were estimated by combining the cancer incidence rates and a two stage disease model shown in fig s1 in this model the mortality burden and morbidity burden should be considered and they are measured in terms of years of life lost ylls and years of lived with disability ylds respectively dalys is the combination of ylls and ylds the calculation formulas are shown as eqs 16 18 soerjomataram et al 2012 16 dalys ylls ylds 17 ylls x n x p x 1 s x e x t d 18 ylds x n x p x 1 s

rate survival rate and standard life expectancy respectively t d is time to death y is disease phase dw is disability weight l is duration p seq is proportion of the sequelae dwseq is disability weight of the sequelae t c is time to cure the details for calculating the parameters in the disease model and dalys estimation are illustrated below 1 p x for bladder cancer induced by thms the total cancer risk crt should be converted into the annual value by being calculated as p x crt rs x sp x where rs x is age specific relative sensitivity and sp x is age span for each age group 1 and 4 for 0 1 and 1 5 age groups and 5 for others the age specific relative sensitivity rs x means the ratio of the age specific incidence rates of bladder cancer to the total incidence rate which was computed based on the corresponding data reported in cancer registration areas of china in 2009 wen et al 2013 as shown in fig s2 for lung and skin cancers induced by arsenic p x can be estimated according to eqs 13 and 14 respectively 2 s x for bladder cancer and lung cancer s x was estimated as s x 1 m i where m and i are cancer mortality and incidence respectively pan et al 2014 age specific incidence rates and mortality rates for the two cancers reported in cancer registration areas of china in 2009 were used for computation chen et al 2013 wen et al 2013 as shown in fig s3 due to the lack of data on skin cancer in china the mortality rate in another study byd et al 1996 was used in this paper for calculating s x which was 0 9 for all age groups 3 l and dw the duration and disability weights of each disease phase are summarized in table s4 murray and lopez 1996 småstuen et al 2008 stouthard et al 1997 the public health group 2005 the median values of time to death t d of bladder lung and skin cancers were 2 193 years 0 833 years and 1 003 year respectively the median values of time to cure t c of bladder lung and skin cancers were 4 00 years 6 00 years and 5 00 years respectively 4 others the values of standard life expectancy e x for males and females were 80 years and 82 5 years respectively murray 1994 population size at age class was based on xi an population structure in 2015 xi an municipal bureau of statistics 2016 due to limited data available only a set of disabling sequelae could be obtained soerjomataram et al 2012 in this paper the sequelae among bladder cancer survivors were included such as incontinence impotence primary infertility and secondary infertility table s5 presents the proportions and disability weights of the sequelae murray and lopez 1996 stouthard et al 1997 soerjomataram et al 2012 the public health group 2005 3 results and discussion 3 1 concentrations of thms and arsenic in drinking water the concentrations of four thms and arsenic in the water samples are given in table 1 the levels of tcm bdcm dbcm tbm and arsenic were ranged from below the detection limits to 52 50 μg l mean 12 67 μg l to 12 80 μg l mean 1 42 μg l to 8 50 μg l mean 0 60 μg l and to 5 30 μg l mean 0 13 μg l to 9 59 μg l mean 1 00 μg l respectively the concentrations of the studied chemicals in all samples were below the chinese guideline values 60 μg l 60 μg l 100 μg l 100 μg l and 10 μg l for tcm bdcm dbcm tbm and arsenic respectively and at the acceptable levels the concentrations of thms were lower than that in canada legay et al 2011 the united states krasner et al 2006 korea kim 2009 turkey uyak 2006 hongkong lee et al 2004 and india basu et al 2011 while a little higher than those in thailand pentamwa et al 2013 variations in raw water quality and treatment systems may explain the different values of thms around the world for arsenic the levels in xi an city were comparable with that in denmark baastrup et al 2008 and the united states bulka et al 2016 as illustrated in table 1 the average concentrations of the chemicals followed the order tcm bdcm arsenic dbcm tbm tcm and bdcm were the two dominant thm species in all samples which on average accounted for 85 49 and 9 58 to the total thms respectively the contribution sequence of thms was consistent with those reported in australia summerhayes et al 2011 malaysia abdullah et al 2003 korea kim 2009 and canada legay et al 2011 the main reason for larger proportion of tcm may be that compared to bromide ion chlorine has higher reaction rates with thms precursors kumari and gupta 2018 the distributions of thms and arsenic are shown in fig 2 where the five compounds had different distribution characteristics the concentrations of tcm were best fitted with a logistic distribution and that of bdcm and arsenic were best fitted with logarithmic normal distributions other two species of thms dbcm and tbm were best fitted with weibull distributions the resulting distribution parameters are shown in table 1 as well the difference of the probability distributions may be associated with the raw water quality chemical characteristics and interactions water treatment process corrosion products water residence time hydraulic characteristics pipe characteristics and nature of water supply infrastructure andra et al 2014 golea et al 2017 kim et al 2011 3 2 cancer risks induced by thms and arsenic according to eqs 1 3 the chronic daily intakes cdi values of thms and arsenic were calculated using the fitted distributions of the input variables shown in table 1 and table s1 then the evaluation of the lifetime cancer risks induced by thms was carried out using monte carlo simulation based on eqs 9 12 the results are shown in table 2 the mean and 95th percentile values of total lifetime cancer risk for the three thms were 8 54 10 6 and 2 77 10 5 respectively which were higher than the minimum or negligible risk level set by usepa 1 00 10 6 usepa 1989 for the average exposure scenario bdcm made the largest contribution to the total cancer risk 60 77 followed by dbcm 38 52 and tbm 0 71 however the contribution sequence was changed under higher exposure scenario dbcm 54 13 bdcm 44 77 tbm 1 10 oral ingestion was found to be the most prominent exposure pathway mean 5 06 10 6 followed by inhalation mean 3 44 10 6 whereas dermal absorption showed negligible risk mean 2 22 10 8 the lifetime cancer risk of thms for females was higher than that for males through oral ingestion and dermal absorption the mean values of total oral and dermal cancer risk for females were 8 04 13 54 and 14 65 higher than that for males due to higher inhalation rate males had higher thms cancer risk mean 3 33 10 6 through inhalation than females mean 3 28 10 6 for arsenic the cancer risks incidence rates of lung cancer and skin cancer were estimated based on the mean and 95th percentile cdi values and eqs 13 15 the age specific incidence rates of the two cancers under the average cdi values are presented in fig 3 and the cancer risks induced by arsenic are shown in table 3 although the arsenic concentrations were always at a low level 10 μg l the mean value of total lifetime cancer risk for arsenic was 4 02 10 5 which were 40 2 times of the negligible risk level 1 00 10 6 the skin cancer risk mean 3 67 10 5 was found to be much higher than the lung cancer risk mean 3 54 10 6 and the largest difference was recorded for females where the mean risk value of skin cancer was five orders of magnitude higher than that of lung cancer more than 99 of the cancer risk was from oral ingestion while dermal absorption had a little contribution 1 males suffer higher risk than females for both cancers actually the average risk level of lung cancer for males was higher than that of females by four to eight orders of magnitude as illustrated in fig 3 amongst different age groups 85 and over years was most vulnerable to the lung and skin cancer risks which was mainly attributed to the highest exposure duration moreover with the increase of age peoples may be more susceptible to the detrimental effects of contaminant exposure 3 3 dalys estimation for low level arsenic and thms to evaluate the disease burden of three thms and low level arsenic in drinking water the age specific lost of dalys ylls and ylds was calculated based on the mean values of the total cancer risks due to the studied hazards the results are illustrated in fig 4 the dalys lost was highest for the age group of 75 80 years 4 30 person year followed by 70 75 years 3 76 person year while it was lowest for 0 1 years 0 person year this may be attributed to the population numbers cancer incidence rates and survival rates for different age groups the total dalys estimation for all age groups was 32 62 person year and the average individual dalys lost was 4 77 10 6 per person year ppy which was 4 77 times of the reference risk level defined by the who 1 00 10 6 ppy who 2011 moreover the total ylls and ylds for all age groups were 30 76 person year and 1 86 person year respectively revealing that the mortality burden made the much higher contribution 94 30 to the total disease burden than the morbidity burden 5 70 similar to the distribution of dalys lost the highest mortality burden ylls lost was recorded in the 75 80 years age group 4 08 person year and the lowest value 0 person year occurred in the age groups of 0 1 years and 1 5 years however the distribution of morbidity burden ylds lost was different from that of dalys and ylls lost the age group of 60 65 years had the highest ylds lost 0 26 person year while 0 1 years had the lowest lost of 0 person year the different characteristics in bladder lung and skin cancers may be the main reason for the different distributions including disease duration disability weight and proportion of the sequelae in addition peoples lifestyle and health status of different age groups may affect the distribution of total disease burden fig 5 presents the age specific lost of dalys ylls and ylds for different cancers the total dalys lost for all age groups followed the order skin cancer 15 32 person year bladder cancer 9 11 person year lung cancer 8 19 person year resulting in the same sequence of the average individual dalys lost skin cancer 2 24 10 6 ppy bladder cancer 1 33 10 6 ppy lung cancer 1 20 10 6 ppy the average individual dalys lost of each disease was higher than the reference risk level of 1 00 10 6 ppy lung cancer and skin cancer were associated with low level arsenic in drinking water and their dalys lost was 72 07 of the total disease burden comparatively the dalys lost of bladder cancer which was mainly induced by thms made less contribution 27 93 to the total disease burden therefore arsenic was the priority hazard in xi an drinking water although the exposure to arsenic was lower than that to thms out of all the diseases studied skin cancer was found to have the highest value of total ylls lost 14 80 person year followed by lung cancer 8 06 person year and bladder cancer 7 91 person year however the contribution of the three cancers to ylds lost followed the order bladder cancer 64 52 skin cancer 27 96 lung cancer 7 52 the main reason may be that bladder cancer had relatively high survival rate and possible sequela among survivors fernández et al 2009 furthermore for the age groups of 70 years the highest disease burden was recorded in skin cancer while for 70 years age groups that was recorded in bladder cancer the highest dalys lost of the three cancers appeared in different age groups 55 60 years for skin cancer and 75 80 years for bladder and lung cancers to find out the disease burden distributions in males and females their lost of dalys ylls and ylds at specific age were calculated as shown in fig 6 the total dalys lost for males 23 22 person year was much higher than that for females 8 03 person year the same conclusion could be drawn for total ylls and ylds lost the average individual dalys lost for males and females were 6 63 10 6 ppy and 2 40 10 6 ppy respectively as illustrated both males and females had the highest disease burden at the age between 75 and 80 with the dalys estimation of 2 75 person year and 1 29 person year respectively for the age groups of 10 years males suffered much more dalys lost than females in fact most dalys for males were 2 10 times to that for females in the same age group the main reason may be that males had larger population number and much higher cancer incidence rate especially for skin cancer and lung cancer in addition different physiological characteristics and lifestyle in males and females may influence their susceptibility to the detrimental effects of contaminant exposure 3 4 comparison of the disease burden through different exposure routes the disease burden caused by thms and low level arsenic via different exposure routes are summarized in table 4 the average individual dalys lost for bdcm dbcm tbm and arsenic were 8 04 10 7 ppy 5 15 10 7 ppy 8 84 10 9 ppy and 3 40 10 6 ppy respectively as mentioned above despite of much lower concentrations and exposure doses the disease burden from arsenic in xi an drinking water was 3 40 times of the reference level 1 00 10 6 ppy the dalys estimation for different hazards followed the order arsenic bdcm dbcm tbm which was consistent with the order of the mean values of total cancer risk due to the relatively high toxicity low level arsenic in drinking water made the highest contribution to the total disease burden therefore compared thms arsenic should be of priority control to reduce the cancer risk of drinking water in xi an city moreover oral ingestion made the most contribution 88 58 to the total disease burden followed by inhalation of thms 11 30 whereas dermal absorption showed negligible risk 0 12 for arsenic the average individual dalys lost through dermal absorption was lower than the corresponding value through oral ingestion by four orders of magnitude this is because that arsenic mainly enters into the human body through food and drinking water while very little intake through the skin by contact with water for the three thms the average individual dalys lost via oral ingestion was comparable to that via inhalation while the dermal disease burden was two orders of magnitude lower than that from the other two pathways thus besides oral ingestion inhalation exposure to volatile thms was an important route for the cancer risk which was in agreement with other studies basu et al 2011 pan et al 2014 the inhalation contribution for the three thms followed the order bdcm 44 90 dbcm 33 59 tbm 15 72 which was in accordance with the order of their concentrations in drinking water 3 5 uncertainty analysis there were still some limitations and uncertainties in the risk assessment based on dalys in this study first uncertainties could come from the models proposed by the usepa and nrc these models were based on the epidemiological data in taiwan with high level arsenic exposure which may give rise to the issue of predictive validity for the application on low level arsenic in drinking water due to limited knowledge and data the reasonable dose response relationship for estimating the cancer risk induced by low level arsenic has not been well understood so the calculation results for arsenic based on the linear extrapolation of the adopted models may be quite different from the real cancer risk in xi an where the low level exposure of arsenic from drinking water was observed second the habits and patterns of water consumption among chinese people are different from people in taiwan or other areas around the world most people in china drink boiled water where the thms concentrations are reduced significantly thus the associated risk from oral ingestion of thms is reduced greatly as well in this study tcm was not included in the cancer risk assessment of thms however some authorities still have the slope factors for tcm krasner and wright 2005 so further studies should be carried out to evaluate the tcm toxicity and provide a unified method for risk assessment some parameter values in this study were obtained from the recommended values of usepa or previous studies such as ingestion rate irw and inhalation rate ira which may not be specific for the residents in xi an city in addition with consideration of the spatial and temporal variations in contaminant concentrations more extensive survey is needed to support their probability distributions which greatly affect the risk assessment although the duration l and disability weights dw of each disease stage were obtained from other studies the dalys results are proved to be stable the variability of dalys method mainly comes from epidemiological data other than l and dw therefore the uncertainties of l and dw during the calculation of dalys lost were not considered in this paper 4 conclusion to find out the priority hazard in drinking water an estimation of the cancer risks from thms and low level arsenic was performed using dalys method based on a two year sampling in xi an city northwest china major conclusions are drawn as follows the average concentrations of tcm bdcm dbcm tbm and arsenic in drinking water were 12 67 μg l 1 42 μg l 0 60 μg l 0 13 μg l and 1 00 μg l respectively which are always at the acceptable levels the contaminant concentrations showed different probability distributions logistic distribution for tcm logarithmic normal distribution for bdcm and arsenic and weibull distribution for dbcm and tbm the mean values of total lifetime cancer risk for all thms and arsenic were 8 54 10 6 and 4 02 10 5 which were 8 54 and 40 2 times of the negligible risk level 1 00 10 6 respectively females are found to have higher cancer risks of thms through oral ingestion and dermal absorption while males suffer higher risk of arsenic through all pathways and thms through inhalation the total dalys estimation for all age groups was 32 62 person year and the average individual dalys lost was 4 77 10 6 per person year ppy which was 4 77 times of the reference risk level defined by the who 1 00 10 6 ppy the dalys lost was highest for the age group of 75 80 years 4 30 person year out of the diseases studied skin cancer had the highest disease burden of 2 24 10 6 ppy followed by bladder cancer 1 33 10 6 ppy and lung cancer 1 20 10 6 ppy approximately 72 07 of the total disease burden was due to arsenic which was considered to be the priority hazard in xi an drinking water the average individual dalys lost for males and females were 6 63 10 6 ppy and 2 40 10 6 ppy respectively both males and females had the highest disease burden at the age between 75 and 80 with the dalys estimation of 2 75 person year and 1 29 person year respectively although females had higher incidence of bladder cancer most dalys lost for males were 2 4 times to that for females in the same age group oral ingestion made the most contribution 88 58 to the total disease burden followed by inhalation of thms 11 30 whereas dermal absorption showed negligible risk 0 12 dalys is a useful method to determine the prioritization of hazardous chemicals in drinking water this study was the first to assess and compare disease burden caused by thms and low level arsenic to the public in china more comprehensive assessment considering other important hazards e g cryptosporidium bromate and lead in drinking water should be further studied to improve the strategies on safe water supply acknowledgment this research was financially supported by the national natural science foundation of china no 51508452

19296,after treated wastewater is discharged into surface water for unplanned indirect potable reuse solar irradiation transforms the dissolved organic matter dom which would alter the formation of disinfection byproducts dbps and change the cytotoxicity formation potential ctfp during post chlorination in drinking water treatment plants this study investigated the effects of solar irradiation on the ctfp and total organic halogen formation potential toxfp of wastewater during post chlorination exposure to natural sunlight decreased the formation potential of cytotoxicity to chinese hamster ovary cells under 24 h simulated solar irradiation ctfp and toxfp decreased by more than 40 x ray photoelectron spectra and fourier transformation infrared spectra suggested solar irradiation destroyed the key dbp precursors containing phenolic hydroxyl moieties ph oh the destruction of ph oh under solar irradiation was reflected by a decrease in the electron donating capacity edc of dom and the post chlorination decreased the edc further increasing the irradiation consumed edc abated the chlorine consumed edc while the chlorine consumed edc was positively correlated to the ctfp and toxfp by means of the electrophilic substitution aromatic ring cleavage solar irradiation thus reduced the ctfp and toxfp in wastewater during post chlorination this study revealed that solar irradiation decreased the risks of treated wastewater for unplanned indirect potable reuse and provided a strategy of controlling ctfp and toxfp via reducing edc of dom in pretreatments graphical abstract image 1 keywords solar irradiation chlorination cytotoxicity formation potential total organic halogen formation potential electron donating capacity 1 introduction water unplanned indirect de facto potable reuse occurs worldwide the source water in more than 50 of 2056 drinking water treatment plants dwtps in the united states contains treated wastewater rice and westerhoff 2014 in yangtze river china the highest ratio of de facto reuse exceeds 20 wang et al 2017 as to de facto potable reuse the downstream cities suffer from not only the micropollutants but also the dissolved organic matters dom in treated wastewater zhang et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 dom in treated wastewater differs a lot from natural organic matter nom containing a much higher level of dissolved organic carbon doc and dissolved organic nitrogen don hu et al 2016 thus when treated wastewater is used as a drinking water source the chlorination in dwtps causes larger amounts of toxic disinfection byproducts dbps to be formed because of the presence of larger amounts of precursors richardson et al 2007 therefore during de facto potable reuse the risks posed by dom in treated wastewater needs to be assessed the quality of treated wastewater discharged to receiving water bodies like rivers and lakes can be dramatically affected by exposure to solar light du et al 2018 solar irradiation can degrade micropollutants bodhipaksha et al 2017 liu et al 2016 santos et al 2016 and alter the dom composition and structure it has been found that solar irradiation decreases the ultraviolet uv absorbance of dom in treated wastewater and decreases the fluorescence intensity associated with the presence of tryptophan like and tyrosine like proteins wu et al 2016 besides solar irradiation can transform don in treated wastewater into primary amines and ammonia bronk et al 2010 the photo transformed dom thus exhibits different disinfection byproducts formation potential dbpfp during chlorination the previous studies have found that the formation potential of dichloroacetonitrile and 1 1 dichloropropanone during chlorination was decreased after dom exposure to sunlight wu et al 2016 but trihalomethane and trichloronitromethane formation of irradiated soluble microbial products an important part of dom in treated wastewater increased during chlorination wu et al 2018 therefore evaluating changes in overall halogenated dbps total organic halogen tox under solar irradiation seems necessary yet the influence of solar irradiation on moieties associated with dbp formation in dom remains unclear furthermore considering human exposure to dbps during water potable reuse assessment of cytotoxicity to mammalian cells is of great importance ragazzo et al 2017 plewa et al 2007 2010 an understanding of the effects of solar irradiation on the cytotoxicity formation potential ctfp and the total organic halogen formation potential toxfp of wastewater during post chlorination helps us know the potential risks of treated wastewater in natural environment solar irradiation causes oxidation of dom in treated wastewater through direct photolysis or indirect photolysis via singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radicals giulia et al 2013 zhang and hsu kim 2010 du et al 2018 oxidation processes tend to decrease the electron donating capacity edc of the dom in treated wastewater chon et al 2015 edc changes of humic substances and model compounds oxidized by ozone and microorganisms have been investigated in some depth klüpfel et al 2014 wenk et al 2013 but few studies have focused on the edcs of dom in real wastewater because of the relatively low dom concentrations in wastewater 5th percentile to 95th percentile of doc value is 3 6 14 6 mg l hu et al 2016 which is below the operating ranges of most edc tests wenk et al 2013 in addition the effects of solar irradiation on edc of dom in treated wastewater are poorly understood chlorination would also result in the edc loss of dom via redox and electrophilic substitution aromatic ring cleavage wenk et al 2013 of which the substitution reaction leads to dbp formation efforts have therefore been made to investigate the relationship between edc and dbp formation but poor correlations have been found between dbp formation and edc of model compounds such as resorcinol tannic acid and vanillin mainly because the substitution of phenolic hydroxyl moieties ph oh and the possibility of hydroquinone formation occur differently among different model compounds criquet et al 2015 the relationship between edc and dbp formation in real wastewater remains unknown moreover during the solar irradiation post chlorination process how solar irradiation affects edc of dom and then further affects the cytotoxicity and tox formation during chlorination needs clarification the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of solar irradiation on the ctfp and toxfp of treated secondary effluent wastewater during post chlorination the transformations of key moieties associated with dbp formation in dom under irradiation were analyzed by x ray photoelectron spectra xps and fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy ftir edc changes of dom under irradiation and its impact on ctfp and toxfp during post chlorination were illustrated 2 materials and methods 2 1 water sampling and analysis secondary effluent samples were collected from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in shenzhen china where the anaerobic anoxic oxic processe is used three samples were obtained at different times and labelled a b and c respectively after shipped to the laboratory samples were filtered with 0 45 μm glass fiber before being analyzed and stored at 4 c for subsequent experiment the doc concentration in each sample was determined using a toc l total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu japan the ammonia concentration was determined using an hi 96715 ammonia analyzer hanna italy the ph was determined using a pb 10 ph meter with a glass electrode sartorius design germany the water quality parameters were measured in triplicate 2 2 solar irradiation the irradiation process has been described in detail previously wu et al 2016 briefly water samples were placed in quartz tubes natural solar irradiation was achieved by exposing samples to natural sunlight outdoors in shenzhen china 22 35 n 113 58 e on a summer day simulated solar irradiation was achieved by irradiating samples under a 1000 w xenon lamp in a photochemical reactor xpa 7 xujiang electromechanical plant china the spectrum emitted by the xenon lamp is shown in fig s1 the light intensity was measured using uv b irradiatometer 275 330 nm uv a irradiatometer 320 400 nm and visible light irradiatometer 400 800 nm all provided by beijing normal university photoelectric instrument china according to a previous study du et al 2017a the uv intensity was calculated by adding the intensity determined by uv b irradiatometer and uv a irradiatometer the visible light intensity was the result from the visible light irradiatometer simulated solar irradiation was performed using a visible light intensity of 55 mw cm2 and an uv light intensity of 1 mw cm2 2 3 chlorination for the ctfp and toxfp tests according to du et al 2017b ctfp refers to the maximum formation of cytotoxicity equivalent of the chlorinated sample subtracting the cytotoxicity equivalent of the unchlorinated sample to reach the maximum cytotoxicity formation samples in this study were dosed with chlorine according to equation 1 1 c h l o r i n e m g l 2 d o c m g l 11 n h 3 n m g l 10 where chlorine mg cl2 l is the chlorine dose required to form the maximum cytotoxicity doc mg c l is the dissolved organic carbon concentration in the water sample and nh3 n mg n l is the ammonia concentration in the water sample an extra 10 mg l chlorine was added to ensure chlorine was in excess the chlorine doses used in this study were around 20 mg l and the contact time was 48 h after chlorination the residual chlorine was quenched with ammonium chloride du et al 2017b the chlorination method is described in detail in the supporting information si the ctfp was calculated by using the cytotoxicity equivalent of the chlorinated sample subtracting the cytotoxicity equivalent of the unchlorinated sample the toxfp was calculated by subtracting the tox of the unchlorinated sample from the tox of the chlorinated sample 2 4 solid phase extraction the organic matter in each water sample was concentrated by solid phase extraction spe using a 6 ml oasis hydrophilic lipophilic balance resin cartridge waters usa the spe method is described in detail in the si the doc recovery rate for the spe pretreatment was 80 85 2 5 cell culture and cell viability assay cytotoxicity tests were performed using a chok1 cell line obtained from the america type culture collection atcc usa the culture method is described in detail in the si cell viability was determined using the adenosine triphosphate atp assay which has proved to be more reliable than the staining method when determining the cytotoxicity of a complex mixture such as pollutants in wastewater yang et al 2015 in the assay luminescence from the reaction between atp released by cells and luciferin promega usa is proportional to the number of viable cells broyer et al 2013 luminescence was measured using a spectramax i3 multimode microplate reader molecular devices usa phenol was used as the positive control to allow the cytotoxic equivalent to be quantified the atp assay and cytotoxicity quantification method are described in detail in the si the cytotoxicity was measured in triplicate 2 6 total organic halogen determination the tox concentration was measured using a micro coulometric titration method by a multix 2500 total organic halogen analyzer analytik jena jena germany the 2 4 6 trichlorophenol sigma aldrich usa was applied to determine the recovery of the tox measurement the tox was measured in triplicate and the determination method was described in detail in the si 2 7 electron donating capacity determination the edc values of dom were determined using a mediated electrochemical oxidation meo method adapted from aeschbacher et al 2010 because the concentration of dom in wastewater is usually below the operating range of the meo test the dom used in each experiment was extracted from a 1 l water sample using the spe method described above the eh of the working electrode was provided by a chi750e electrochemical workstation chenhua china and was set as 0 61 v aeschbacher et al 2010 the 10 mg abts sigma aldrich was added to act as an intermediate the edc values of dom was determined from the current time curve using equation 2 2 edc idt f m dom where i is the current a t is the test time s f is the faraday constant 96485 c mole and mdom is the doc value in the sample mg c the edc determination method is described in detail in the si 2 8 spectra measurement ultraviolet absorbance was measured using a uv2600 spectrophotometer shimadzu three dimensional excitation emission matrix of fluorescence spectra was acquired using an f 7000 fluorophotometer shimadzu the determination and data processing method were described in detail in a previous publication chen et al 2003 the molecular weight distribution of the dom was characterized by size exclusion chromatography coupled with uv fluorescence doc detectors as in previous studies wang et al 2014 the carbon species in the dom were identified by xps using an escalab 250xi system thermo fisher scientific usa equipped with a monochromatic al kα x ray source energy resolution 0 45 ev each sample for xps test was concentrated from 1000 ml water sample using the spe method mentioned above thereafter the dried extract was dissolved by 0 5 ml methanol and dropped onto a silicon chip the silicon chip was placed at 40 c for 1 h till the methanol was evaporated and then the xps measurement was performed the functional moieties in the dom were identified by ftir using a nicolet is 50 system thermo fisher scientific using the wavenumber range 500 4000 cm 1 the 3 mg lyophilized sample was mixed well with 300 mg potassium bromide and then the mixture was compressed for ftir measurement 2 9 statistical analysis the lc50 value the concentration at which the relative cell viability of cells was 50 for cytotoxicity equivalent measurement was obtained from the regression analysis of dose response curves the dose response curves were shown in si the results in this study were presented as scatterplots according to weissgerber et al 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 reduction of ctfp caused by solar irradiation solar irradiation effectively decreased the ctfp of the treated wastewater during post chlorination process the triplicates of wastewater ctfp before exposure to light were determined as 40 7 41 0 and 40 6 mg phenol l ctfp decreased to 28 8 29 2 and 31 5 mg phenol l after exposed to natural solar light at the intensity shown in fig s2 for 12 h fig 1 a to better control the irradiation condition the same water sample was exposed to the xenon simulated solar light the ctfp decreased quickly in the first 12 h fig 1b after 24 h irradiation the triplicates of ctfp were determined as 24 4 24 1 and 22 6 mg phenol l around a 40 reduction dose response curves of the cell viability test were shown in fig s3 the ctfp of wastewater which was kept in the dark did not change fig s4 these results suggested that solar irradiation effectively decreased the ctfp thus mitigating the risks of treated wastewater during subsequent chlorination the reduction of ctfp might be due to the transformation of precursors under solar irradiation the transformed dom in treated wastewater would alter cytotoxic byproducts formation during post chlorination it has previously been found that solar irradiation can decrease the uv absorbance in dom chen and westerhoff 2010 treated wastewater can also contain don du et al 2017a which is a crucial precursor of highly toxic nitrogenous dbps richardson et al 2007 solar irradiation tends to transform don into inorganic nitrogen bronk et al 2010 du et al 2017a decreasing the amounts of dbps formed 3 2 reduction of toxfp by solar irradiation the decrease in the ctfp may be related to decreased dbp formation the effect of solar irradiation on the toxfp was investigated the water sample contained some tox before chlorination possibly from organochlorine pollutants contained in the incoming wastewater chlorination substantially increased the tox concentration in the treated wastewater because halogenated dbps were formed fig 2 a solar irradiation substantially decreased the toxfp of the treated wastewater during post chlorination without solar irradiation the triplicates of wastewater toxfp were determined as 1568 1713 and 1656 μg l exposing the dom to solar light decreased the toxfp to 881 884 and 883 μg l after 24 h of irradiation around a 41 reduction solar irradiation has previously been found to decrease the formation potentials for some individual dbps solar irradiation can reduce the formation of haloacetic acid during drinking water chlorination chow et al 2008 also the formation potential of dichloroacetonitrile 1 1 dichloropropanone and 1 1 1 trichloropropanone during wastewater chlorination was reduced after exposing to solar irradiation wu et al 2016 moreover solar irradiation decreased the haloacetamide formation potential during wastewater chloramination because it transferred don to inorganic nitrogen du et al 2017a in this study the abatement of toxfp indicated solar irradiation was effective to lower the formation of overall halogenated dbps these results suggest that exposure of treated wastewater in an environmental buffer e g river or lake to solar light will play an important role in lowering byproducts formation during subsequent chlorination toxicity formation and tox formation during chlorination have been found to correlate du et al 2017b li et al 2017 in this study the ctfps and toxfps during the chlorination of irradiated wastewater also correlated fig 2b these results strongly suggest that cytotoxicity formed during chlorination might be mainly through the formation of halogenated dbps 3 3 destruction of phenolic hydroxyl moieties the decreases in the ctfp and toxfp during chlorination could be caused by the dom being transformed changes of dom under solar irradiation were therefore characterized solar irradiation affected the doc concentration little but decreased the uv absorbance specific uv absorbance suva fluorescence intensity and specific fluorescence intensity of the dom figs s5 s7 changes in uv absorbance and fluorescence intensity usually correlate well with formation of byproducts chen and westerhoff 2010 wu et al 2016 solar irradiation also changed the molecular weight distribution of the dom mainly removing the high molecular weight fraction fig s8 however due to the lack of precursor moieties analysis these findings failed to directly explain the decreases in the ctfp and toxfp during chlorination to clarify the changes of functional moieties under solar irradiation the xps c1s spectra was used to characterize the dom carbon species fig 3 in the spectra the binding energy 284 5 ev is for aliphatic cc bonds 285 4 ev for c n bonds 286 0 ev for phenolic alcoholic or etheric co bonds 287 3 ev for cn bonds 287 9 ev for carbonyl c o bonds and 288 9 ev for the bonds in a carboxylic o co group nie et al 2016 terzyk 2001 wang et al 2016 as shown in fig 3a and b the spectra for the dom before and after solar irradiation exhibited dramatic differences indicating that the carbon functional moieties were altered by solar irradiation the carbon functional moieties distribution is shown in fig 3c after 24 h irradiation the most significant change lied in the cc bonds and co bonds co bond decreased from 28 2 to 8 5 while cc bond increased from 50 0 to 81 9 the co bonds might be phenolic hydroxyl moieties ph oh ether bonds or alcoholic hydroxyl moieties combing the decrease in the number of co bonds and increase in the number of aliphatic cc bonds together it suggested that solar irradiation destroyed phenolic compounds or heterocyclic rings containing oxygen and caused ring cleavage the changes in the functional moieties were investigated further using ftir to characterize the dom before and after solar irradiation fig 4 the band at 3700 3200 cm 1 is for ph oh stretching the band at 1720 1700 cm 1 is for carboxylic c o stretching the band at 1250 1200 cm 1 is for co anti symmetric stretching and the band at 700 600 cm 1 is for ch out of plane deformations fukushima et al 2001 schnitzer and shahamat 1972 it can be seen from fig 4 that the most important change caused by irradiation was a decrease in the intensity of the band at 3700 3200 cm 1 indicating a decrease in the ph oh content the xps and ftir results together indicated that solar irradiation destroyed ph oh in the dom in the treated wastewater similarly ph oh was found to be destroyed when fulvic acid and humic acid were exposed to simulated solar irradiation sharpless et al 2014 the electron donating effects of hydroxyl moieties increases the electron density of the benzene ring facilitating electrophilic substitution of hocl on the benzene ring phenol compounds are therefore considered to be important dbp precursors criquet et al 2015 de vera et al 2017 the pathway for the reaction between phenolic compounds and hocl has been described previously and involves the intermediate byproducts chlorophenol dichlorophenol and trichlorophenol being formed successively then the ring cleaving to form final byproducts such as trihalomethanes haloacetic acids and haloacetonitriles acero et al 2005 gallard and von gunten 2002 jiang et al 2017 the decreases in the ctfp and toxfp during chlorination caused by solar irradiation of the wastewater were therefore probably caused by solar irradiation destroying phenol compounds 3 4 decrease in the edc caused by solar irradiation and post chlorination solar irradiation leads to redox processes which involve electron transfer the ph oh moieties are typical electron donating moieties which tend to donate electrons in the reaction with electrophiles de vera et al 2017 wenk et al 2013 solar irradiation destroyed the ph oh moieties in dom indicating it might affect the edc of dom in treated wastewater herein a mediated electrochemical oxidation technique was used to determine the edc of the dom in treated wastewater according to aeschbacher et al 2010 the changes of edc when treated wastewater was exposed to solar irradiation were investigated the test spectra for samples a and b are shown in fig 5 a and b respectively the edcs calculated using equation 2 are shown in fig 5c solar irradiation dramatically decreased the edcs of dom whereas the edcs of water samples kept in the dark remained unchanged fig s9 the edcs of samples a and b before irradiation were 1 3 and 0 9 μmol e mg c respectively the edcs of samples a and b after 24 h of irradiation decreased to 0 3 μmol e mg c 77 reduction and 0 4 μmol e mg c 56 reduction respectively the edc decreased possibly because dom was oxidized through direct photolysis or through indirect photolysis via reactive oxygen species such as singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radicals sharpless et al 2014 zhang and hsu kim 2010 similarly solar irradiation has been found to decrease the edcs of fulvic acid and humic acid sharpless et al 2014 chlorination also decreases the edc the chlorination of humic substances has been found to cause a complete loss of the edc wenk et al 2013 therefore changes in the edc of dom during chlorination of the solar irradiated samples were investigated the test spectra are shown in fig s10 chlorination substantially reduced the edc of dom for unirradiated wastewater chlorine consumed edc was marked δedcc fig 6 solar irradiation decreased edc of the dom partially solar irradiation consumed edc was marked δedcs and the post chlorination decreased the edc further the total edc losses during irradiation post chlorination were marked δedct before chlorination solar irradiation decreased partial edc and the decrease in the edc through the whole irradiation post chlorination process can be expressed as equation 3 3 δ e d c t δ e d c s δ e d c c where δedcs is the solar irradiation consumed edc δedcc is the chlorine consumed edc and δedct is the total edc loss of dom during the irradiation post chlorination process chlorination decreases the edc of dom through two pathways redox reactions and electrophilic substitution aromatic ring cleavage in redox reactions phenolic compounds are oxidized to benzoquinone and hocl is reduced to chloride wenk et al 2013 however this would not give dbps in electrophilic substitution aromatic ring cleavage chlorine is first substituted into the ortho and para positions of ph oh to give a poly chlorinated phenolic compound li and hoffman 1999 this might partially lose the edc due to the electron withdrawing effect of chlorine then the aromatic rings of the polychlorinated phenolic compounds cleaves which substantially decreased the edc and gave aliphatic dbps gallard and von gunten 2002 wenk et al 2013 the aromatic halogenated dbps reach a relatively high level after 30 min contact time with chlorine and then cleave to form aliphatic dbps jiang et al 2017 zhai and zhang 2011 ring cleavage occurs more easily when a benzene ring contains two meta ph oh moieties boyce and hornig 1983 different types of organic matter have different redox to electrophilic substitution ratios depending on the relative positions of the ph oh moieties and the possibility of hydroquinone formation criquet et al 2015 it was reported that the electrophilic substitution ratios of suwannee river nom suwannee river humic acid and nordic reservoir nom all account for around 20 criquet et al 2015 3 5 decreases in the ctfp and toxfp caused by edc loss reactions between dom and chlorine via electrophilic substitution account for a relatively small proportion but cause dbps to form criquet et al 2015 the chlorine substitution aromatic ring cleavage process decreases the edc wenk et al 2013 it was therefore speculated that the ctfp and toxfp should correlate with the chlorine consumed edc δedcc by plotting the ctfp and toxfp against δedcc fig 7 a it was found that ctfp and toxfp decreased as δedcc decreased the relationship between δedcs and δedcc determined from equation 3 and fig 6 is shown in fig 7b it was found that increasing the δedcs led to the decreased δedcc the destroyed ph oh moieties during solar irradiation was reflected by a decrease in the edc and this decreased the δedcc during post chlorination in addition the δedcc positively correlated with the ctfp and toxfp this explains why solar irradiation decreased the ctfp and toxfp of wastewater during post chlorination the total edc of model compounds such as resorcinol tannic acid and vanillin cannot be used to predict dbp formation during chlorination because the molecular structures and redox substitution ratios of different model compounds vary widely as demonstrated by de vera et al 2017 however the composition and redox substitution ratio of dom from a single wastewater source are relatively constant and the chlorine consumed edc tended to correlate with the changes in the ctfp and toxfp during chlorination this provided the key information that it might be possible to control the ctfp and toxfp in a wastewater treatment plant by decreasing the chlorine consumed edc via performing pretreatment processes notably there is also a possibility that some pretreatment processes might alter the redox substitution ratio like removing redox moieties from the dom in preference to substitution moieties in this case although the edc decreases more chlorine tends to react with the substitution moieties thus increasing the byproducts formation it is therefore necessary to further combine the evaluation of chlorine consumed edc and chlorine substitution reactivity of dom in the future 4 conclusions solar irradiation dramatically affects the water quality after treated

19296,after treated wastewater is discharged into surface water for unplanned indirect potable reuse solar irradiation transforms the dissolved organic matter dom which would alter the formation of disinfection byproducts dbps and change the cytotoxicity formation potential ctfp during post chlorination in drinking water treatment plants this study investigated the effects of solar irradiation on the ctfp and total organic halogen formation potential toxfp of wastewater during post chlorination exposure to natural sunlight decreased the formation potential of cytotoxicity to chinese hamster ovary cells under 24 h simulated solar irradiation ctfp and toxfp decreased by more than 40 x ray photoelectron spectra and fourier transformation infrared spectra suggested solar irradiation destroyed the key dbp precursors containing phenolic hydroxyl moieties ph oh the destruction of ph oh under solar irradiation was reflected by a decrease in the electron donating capacity edc of dom and the post chlorination decreased the edc further increasing the irradiation consumed edc abated the chlorine consumed edc while the chlorine consumed edc was positively correlated to the ctfp and toxfp by means of the electrophilic substitution aromatic ring cleavage solar irradiation thus reduced the ctfp and toxfp in wastewater during post chlorination this study revealed that solar irradiation decreased the risks of treated wastewater for unplanned indirect potable reuse and provided a strategy of controlling ctfp and toxfp via reducing edc of dom in pretreatments graphical abstract image 1 keywords solar irradiation chlorination cytotoxicity formation potential total organic halogen formation potential electron donating capacity 1 introduction water unplanned indirect de facto potable reuse occurs worldwide the source water in more than 50 of 2056 drinking water treatment plants dwtps in the united states contains treated wastewater rice and westerhoff 2014 in yangtze river china the highest ratio of de facto reuse exceeds 20 wang et al 2017 as to de facto potable reuse the downstream cities suffer from not only the micropollutants but also the dissolved organic matters dom in treated wastewater zhang et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 dom in treated wastewater differs a lot from natural organic matter nom containing a much higher level of dissolved organic carbon doc and dissolved organic nitrogen don hu et al 2016 thus when treated wastewater is used as a drinking water source the chlorination in dwtps causes larger amounts of toxic disinfection byproducts dbps to be formed because of the presence of larger amounts of precursors richardson et al 2007 therefore during de facto potable reuse the risks posed by dom in treated wastewater needs to be assessed the quality of treated wastewater discharged to receiving water bodies like rivers and lakes can be dramatically affected by exposure to solar light du et al 2018 solar irradiation can degrade micropollutants bodhipaksha et al 2017 liu et al 2016 santos et al 2016 and alter the dom composition and structure it has been found that solar irradiation decreases the ultraviolet uv absorbance of dom in treated wastewater and decreases the fluorescence intensity associated with the presence of tryptophan like and tyrosine like proteins wu et al 2016 besides solar irradiation can transform don in treated wastewater into primary amines and ammonia bronk et al 2010 the photo transformed dom thus exhibits different disinfection byproducts formation potential dbpfp during chlorination the previous studies have found that the formation potential of dichloroacetonitrile and 1 1 dichloropropanone during chlorination was decreased after dom exposure to sunlight wu et al 2016 but trihalomethane and trichloronitromethane formation of irradiated soluble microbial products an important part of dom in treated wastewater increased during chlorination wu et al 2018 therefore evaluating changes in overall halogenated dbps total organic halogen tox under solar irradiation seems necessary yet the influence of solar irradiation on moieties associated with dbp formation in dom remains unclear furthermore considering human exposure to dbps during water potable reuse assessment of cytotoxicity to mammalian cells is of great importance ragazzo et al 2017 plewa et al 2007 2010 an understanding of the effects of solar irradiation on the cytotoxicity formation potential ctfp and the total organic halogen formation potential toxfp of wastewater during post chlorination helps us know the potential risks of treated wastewater in natural environment solar irradiation causes oxidation of dom in treated wastewater through direct photolysis or indirect photolysis via singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radicals giulia et al 2013 zhang and hsu kim 2010 du et al 2018 oxidation processes tend to decrease the electron donating capacity edc of the dom in treated wastewater chon et al 2015 edc changes of humic substances and model compounds oxidized by ozone and microorganisms have been investigated in some depth klüpfel et al 2014 wenk et al 2013 but few studies have focused on the edcs of dom in real wastewater because of the relatively low dom concentrations in wastewater 5th percentile to 95th percentile of doc value is 3 6 14 6 mg l hu et al 2016 which is below the operating ranges of most edc tests wenk et al 2013 in addition the effects of solar irradiation on edc of dom in treated wastewater are poorly understood chlorination would also result in the edc loss of dom via redox and electrophilic substitution aromatic ring cleavage wenk et al 2013 of which the substitution reaction leads to dbp formation efforts have therefore been made to investigate the relationship between edc and dbp formation but poor correlations have been found between dbp formation and edc of model compounds such as resorcinol tannic acid and vanillin mainly because the substitution of phenolic hydroxyl moieties ph oh and the possibility of hydroquinone formation occur differently among different model compounds criquet et al 2015 the relationship between edc and dbp formation in real wastewater remains unknown moreover during the solar irradiation post chlorination process how solar irradiation affects edc of dom and then further affects the cytotoxicity and tox formation during chlorination needs clarification the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of solar irradiation on the ctfp and toxfp of treated secondary effluent wastewater during post chlorination the transformations of key moieties associated with dbp formation in dom under irradiation were analyzed by x ray photoelectron spectra xps and fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy ftir edc changes of dom under irradiation and its impact on ctfp and toxfp during post chlorination were illustrated 2 materials and methods 2 1 water sampling and analysis secondary effluent samples were collected from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in shenzhen china where the anaerobic anoxic oxic processe is used three samples were obtained at

described in detail previously wu et al 2016 briefly water samples were placed in quartz tubes natural solar irradiation was achieved by exposing samples to natural sunlight outdoors in shenzhen china 22 35 n 113 58 e on a summer day simulated solar irradiation was achieved by irradiating samples under a 1000 w xenon lamp in a photochemical reactor xpa 7 xujiang electromechanical plant china the spectrum emitted by the xenon lamp is shown in fig s1 the light intensity was measured using uv b irradiatometer 275 330 nm uv a irradiatometer 320 400 nm and visible light irradiatometer 400 800 nm all provided by beijing normal university photoelectric instrument china according to a previous study du et al 2017a the uv intensity was calculated by adding the intensity determined by uv b irradiatometer and uv a irradiatometer the visible light intensity was the result from the visible light irradiatometer simulated solar irradiation was performed using a visible light intensity of 55 mw cm2 and an uv light intensity of 1 mw cm2 2 3 chlorination for the ctfp and toxfp tests according to du et al 2017b ctfp refers to the maximum formation of cytotoxicity equivalent of the chlorinated sample subtracting the cytotoxicity equivalent of the unchlorinated sample to reach the maximum cytotoxicity formation samples in this study were dosed with chlorine according to equation 1 1 c h l o r i n e m g l 2 d o c m g l 11 n h 3 n m g l 10 where chlorine mg cl2 l is the chlorine dose required to form the maximum cytotoxicity doc mg c l is the dissolved organic carbon concentration in the water sample and nh3 n mg n l is the ammonia concentration in the water sample an extra 10 mg l chlorine was added to ensure chlorine was in excess the chlorine doses used in this study were around 20 mg l and the contact time was 48 h after chlorination the residual chlorine was quenched with ammonium chloride du et al 2017b the chlorination method is described in detail in the supporting information si the ctfp was calculated by using the cytotoxicity equivalent of the chlorinated sample subtracting the cytotoxicity equivalent of the unchlorinated sample the toxfp was calculated by subtracting the tox of the unchlorinated sample from the tox of the chlorinated sample 2 4 solid phase extraction the organic matter in each water sample was concentrated by solid phase extraction spe using a 6 ml oasis hydrophilic lipophilic balance resin cartridge waters usa the spe method is described in detail in the si the doc recovery rate for the spe pretreatment was 80 85 2 5 cell culture and cell viability assay cytotoxicity tests were performed using a chok1 cell line obtained from the america type culture collection atcc usa the culture method is described in detail in the si cell viability was determined using the adenosine triphosphate atp assay which has proved to be more reliable than the staining method when determining the cytotoxicity of a complex mixture such as pollutants in wastewater yang et al 2015 in the assay luminescence from the reaction between atp released by cells and luciferin promega usa is proportional to the number of viable cells broyer et al 2013 luminescence was measured using a spectramax i3 multimode microplate reader molecular devices usa phenol was used as the positive control to allow the cytotoxic equivalent to be quantified the atp assay and cytotoxicity quantification method are described in detail in the si the cytotoxicity was measured in triplicate 2 6 total organic halogen determination the tox concentration was measured using a micro coulometric titration method by a multix 2500 total organic halogen analyzer analytik jena jena germany the 2 4 6 trichlorophenol sigma aldrich usa was applied to determine the recovery of the tox measurement the tox was measured in triplicate and the determination method was described in detail in the si 2 7 electron donating capacity determination the edc values of dom were determined using a mediated electrochemical oxidation meo method adapted from aeschbacher et al 2010 because the concentration of dom in wastewater is usually below the operating range of the meo test the dom used in each experiment was extracted from a 1 l water sample using the spe method described above the eh of the working electrode was provided by a chi750e electrochemical workstation chenhua china and was set as 0 61 v aeschbacher et al 2010 the 10 mg abts sigma aldrich was added to act as an intermediate the edc values of dom was determined from the current time curve using equation 2 2 edc idt f m dom where i is the current a t is the test time s f is the faraday constant 96485 c mole and mdom is the doc value in the sample mg c the edc determination method is described in detail in the si 2 8 spectra measurement ultraviolet absorbance was measured using a uv2600 spectrophotometer shimadzu three dimensional excitation emission matrix of fluorescence spectra was acquired using an f 7000 fluorophotometer shimadzu the determination and data processing method were described in detail in a previous publication chen et al 2003 the molecular weight distribution of the dom was characterized by size exclusion chromatography coupled with uv fluorescence doc detectors as in previous studies wang et al 2014 the carbon species in the dom were identified by xps using an escalab 250xi system thermo fisher scientific usa equipped with a monochromatic al kα x ray source energy resolution 0 45 ev each sample for xps test was concentrated from 1000 ml water sample using the spe method mentioned above thereafter the dried extract was dissolved by 0 5 ml methanol and dropped onto a silicon chip the silicon chip was placed at 40 c for 1 h till the methanol was evaporated and then the xps measurement was performed the functional moieties in the dom were identified by ftir using a nicolet is 50 system thermo fisher scientific using the wavenumber range 500 4000 cm 1 the 3 mg lyophilized sample was mixed well with 300 mg potassium bromide and then the mixture was compressed for ftir measurement 2 9 statistical analysis the lc50 value the concentration at which the relative cell viability of cells was 50 for cytotoxicity equivalent measurement was obtained from the regression analysis of dose response curves the dose response curves were shown in si the results in this study were presented as scatterplots according to weissgerber et al 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 reduction of ctfp caused by solar irradiation solar irradiation effectively decreased the ctfp of the treated wastewater during post chlorination process the triplicates of wastewater ctfp before exposure to light were determined as 40 7 41 0 and 40 6 mg phenol l ctfp decreased to 28 8 29 2 and 31 5 mg phenol l after exposed to natural solar light at the intensity shown in fig s2 for 12 h fig 1 a to better control the irradiation condition the same water sample was exposed to the xenon simulated solar light the ctfp decreased quickly in the first 12 h fig 1b after 24 h irradiation the triplicates of ctfp were determined as 24 4 24 1 and 22 6 mg phenol l around a 40 reduction dose response curves of the cell viability test were shown in fig s3 the ctfp of wastewater which was kept in the dark did not change fig s4 these results suggested that solar irradiation effectively decreased the ctfp thus mitigating the risks of treated wastewater during subsequent chlorination the reduction of ctfp might be due to the transformation of precursors under solar irradiation the transformed dom in treated wastewater would alter cytotoxic byproducts formation during post chlorination it has previously been found that solar irradiation can decrease the uv absorbance in dom chen and westerhoff 2010 treated wastewater can also contain don du et al 2017a which is a crucial precursor of highly toxic nitrogenous dbps richardson et al 2007 solar irradiation tends to transform don into inorganic nitrogen bronk et al 2010 du et al 2017a decreasing the amounts of dbps formed 3 2 reduction of toxfp by solar irradiation the decrease in the ctfp may be related to decreased dbp formation the effect of solar irradiation on the toxfp was investigated the water sample contained some tox before chlorination possibly from organochlorine pollutants contained in the incoming wastewater chlorination substantially increased the tox concentration in the treated wastewater because halogenated dbps were formed fig 2 a solar irradiation substantially decreased the toxfp of the treated wastewater during post chlorination without solar irradiation the triplicates of wastewater toxfp were determined as 1568 1713 and 1656 μg l exposing the dom to solar light decreased the toxfp to 881 884 and 883 μg l after 24 h of irradiation around a 41 reduction solar irradiation has previously been found to decrease the formation potentials for some individual dbps solar irradiation can reduce the formation of haloacetic acid during drinking water chlorination chow et al 2008 also the formation potential of dichloroacetonitrile 1 1 dichloropropanone and 1 1 1 trichloropropanone during wastewater chlorination was reduced after exposing to solar irradiation wu et al 2016 moreover solar irradiation decreased the haloacetamide formation potential during wastewater chloramination because it transferred don to inorganic nitrogen du et al 2017a in this study the abatement of toxfp indicated solar irradiation was effective to lower the formation of overall halogenated dbps these results suggest that exposure of treated wastewater in an environmental buffer e g river or lake to solar light will play an important role in lowering byproducts formation during subsequent chlorination toxicity formation and tox formation during chlorination have been found to correlate du et al 2017b li et al 2017 in this study the ctfps and toxfps during the chlorination of irradiated wastewater also correlated fig 2b these results strongly suggest that cytotoxicity formed during chlorination might be mainly through the formation of halogenated dbps 3 3 destruction of phenolic hydroxyl moieties the decreases in the ctfp and toxfp during chlorination could be caused by the dom being transformed changes of dom under solar irradiation were therefore characterized solar irradiation affected the doc concentration little but decreased the uv absorbance specific uv absorbance suva fluorescence intensity and specific fluorescence intensity of the dom figs s5 s7 changes in uv absorbance and fluorescence intensity usually correlate well with formation of byproducts chen and westerhoff 2010 wu et al 2016 solar irradiation also changed the molecular weight distribution of the dom mainly removing the high molecular weight fraction fig s8 however due to the lack of precursor moieties analysis these findings failed to directly explain the decreases in the ctfp and toxfp during chlorination to clarify the changes of functional moieties under solar irradiation the xps c1s spectra was used to characterize the dom carbon species fig 3 in the spectra the binding energy 284 5 ev is for aliphatic cc bonds 285 4 ev for c n bonds 286 0 ev for phenolic alcoholic or etheric co bonds 287 3 ev for cn bonds 287 9 ev for carbonyl c o bonds and 288 9 ev for the bonds in a carboxylic o co group nie et al 2016 terzyk 2001 wang et al 2016 as shown in fig 3a and b the spectra for the dom before and after solar irradiation exhibited dramatic differences indicating that the carbon functional moieties were altered by solar irradiation the carbon functional moieties distribution is shown in fig 3c after 24 h irradiation the most significant change lied in the cc bonds and co bonds co bond decreased from 28 2 to 8 5 while cc bond increased from 50 0 to 81 9 the co bonds might be phenolic hydroxyl moieties ph oh ether bonds or alcoholic hydroxyl moieties combing the decrease in the number of co bonds and increase in the number of aliphatic cc bonds together it suggested that solar irradiation destroyed phenolic compounds or heterocyclic rings containing oxygen and caused ring cleavage the changes in the functional moieties were investigated further using ftir to characterize the dom before and after solar irradiation fig 4 the band at 3700 3200 cm 1 is for ph oh stretching the band at 1720 1700 cm 1 is for carboxylic c o stretching the band at 1250 1200 cm 1 is for co anti symmetric stretching and the band at 700 600 cm 1 is for ch out of plane deformations fukushima et al 2001 schnitzer and shahamat 1972 it can be seen from fig 4 that the most important change caused by irradiation was a decrease in the intensity of the band at 3700 3200 cm 1 indicating a decrease in the ph oh content the xps and ftir results together indicated that solar irradiation destroyed ph oh in the dom in the treated wastewater similarly ph oh was found to be destroyed when fulvic acid and humic acid were exposed to simulated solar irradiation sharpless et al 2014 the electron donating effects of hydroxyl moieties increases the electron density of the benzene ring facilitating electrophilic substitution of hocl on the benzene ring phenol compounds are therefore considered to be important dbp precursors criquet et al 2015 de vera et al 2017 the pathway for the reaction between phenolic compounds and hocl has been described previously and involves the intermediate byproducts chlorophenol dichlorophenol and trichlorophenol being formed successively then the ring cleaving to form final byproducts such as trihalomethanes haloacetic acids and haloacetonitriles acero et al 2005 gallard and von gunten 2002 jiang et al 2017 the decreases in the ctfp and toxfp during chlorination caused by solar irradiation of the wastewater were therefore probably caused by solar irradiation destroying phenol compounds 3 4 decrease in the edc caused by solar irradiation and post chlorination solar irradiation leads to redox processes which involve electron transfer the ph oh moieties are typical electron donating moieties which tend to donate electrons in the reaction with electrophiles de vera et al 2017 wenk et al 2013 solar irradiation destroyed the ph oh moieties in dom indicating it might affect the edc of dom in treated wastewater herein a mediated electrochemical oxidation technique was used to determine the edc of the dom in treated wastewater according to aeschbacher et al 2010 the changes of edc when treated wastewater was exposed to solar irradiation were investigated the test spectra for samples a and b are shown in fig 5 a and b respectively the edcs calculated using equation 2 are shown in fig 5c solar irradiation dramatically decreased the edcs of dom whereas the edcs of water samples kept in the dark remained unchanged fig s9 the edcs of samples a and b before irradiation were 1 3 and 0 9 μmol e mg c respectively the edcs of samples a and b after 24 h of irradiation decreased to 0 3 μmol e mg c 77 reduction and 0 4 μmol e mg c 56 reduction respectively the edc decreased possibly because dom was oxidized through direct photolysis or through indirect photolysis via reactive oxygen species such as singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radicals sharpless et al 2014 zhang and hsu kim 2010 similarly solar irradiation has been found to decrease the edcs of fulvic acid and humic acid sharpless et al 2014 chlorination also decreases the edc the chlorination of humic substances has been found to cause a complete loss of the edc wenk et al 2013 therefore changes in the edc of dom during chlorination of the solar irradiated samples were investigated the test spectra are shown in fig s10 chlorination substantially reduced the edc of dom for unirradiated wastewater chlorine consumed edc was marked δedcc fig 6 solar irradiation decreased edc of the dom partially solar irradiation consumed edc was marked δedcs and the post chlorination decreased the edc further the total edc losses during irradiation post chlorination were marked δedct before chlorination solar irradiation decreased partial edc and the decrease in the edc through the whole irradiation post chlorination process can be expressed as equation 3 3 δ e d c t δ e d c s δ e d c c where δedcs is the solar irradiation consumed edc δedcc is the chlorine consumed edc and δedct is the total edc loss of dom during the irradiation post chlorination process chlorination decreases the edc of dom through two pathways redox reactions and electrophilic substitution aromatic ring cleavage in redox reactions phenolic compounds are oxidized to benzoquinone and hocl is reduced to chloride wenk et al 2013 however this would not give dbps in electrophilic substitution aromatic ring cleavage chlorine is first substituted into the ortho and para positions of ph oh to give a poly chlorinated phenolic compound li and hoffman 1999 this might partially lose the edc due to the electron withdrawing effect of chlorine then the aromatic rings of the polychlorinated phenolic compounds cleaves which substantially decreased the edc and gave aliphatic dbps gallard and von gunten 2002 wenk et al 2013 the aromatic halogenated dbps reach a relatively high level after 30 min contact time with chlorine and then cleave to form aliphatic dbps jiang et al 2017 zhai and zhang 2011 ring cleavage occurs more easily when a benzene ring contains two meta ph oh moieties boyce and hornig 1983 different types of organic matter have different redox to electrophilic substitution ratios depending on the relative positions of the ph oh moieties and the possibility of hydroquinone formation criquet et al 2015 it was reported that the electrophilic substitution ratios of suwannee river nom suwannee river humic acid and nordic reservoir nom all account for around 20 criquet et al 2015 3 5 decreases in the ctfp and toxfp caused by edc loss reactions between dom and chlorine via electrophilic substitution account for a relatively small proportion but cause dbps to form criquet et al 2015 the chlorine substitution aromatic ring cleavage process decreases the edc wenk et al 2013 it was therefore speculated that the ctfp and toxfp should correlate with the chlorine consumed edc δedcc by plotting the ctfp and toxfp against δedcc fig 7 a it was found that ctfp and toxfp decreased as δedcc decreased the relationship between δedcs and δedcc determined from equation 3 and fig 6 is shown in fig 7b it was found that increasing the δedcs led to the decreased δedcc the destroyed ph oh moieties during solar irradiation was reflected by a decrease in the edc and this decreased the δedcc during post chlorination in addition the δedcc positively correlated with the ctfp and toxfp this explains why solar irradiation decreased the ctfp and toxfp of wastewater during post chlorination the total edc of model compounds such as resorcinol tannic acid and vanillin cannot be used to predict dbp formation during chlorination because the molecular structures and redox substitution ratios of different model compounds vary widely as demonstrated by de vera et al 2017 however the composition and redox substitution ratio of dom from a single wastewater source are relatively constant and the chlorine consumed edc tended to correlate with the changes in the ctfp and toxfp during chlorination this provided the key information that it might be possible to control the ctfp and toxfp in a wastewater treatment plant by decreasing the chlorine consumed edc via performing pretreatment processes notably there is also a possibility that some pretreatment processes might alter the redox substitution ratio like removing redox moieties from the dom in preference to substitution moieties in this case although the edc decreases more chlorine tends to react with the substitution moieties thus increasing the byproducts formation it is therefore necessary to further combine the evaluation of chlorine consumed edc and chlorine substitution reactivity of dom in the future 4 conclusions solar irradiation dramatically affects the water quality after treated wastewater is discharged into surface water the effects of solar irradiation on the formation potential of cytotoxicity and total organic halogen during post chlorination were investigated the main conclusions are summarized below 1 natural solar irradiation reduced the ctfp of treated wastewater during post chlorination after exposing to simulated solar light for 24 h visible light and uv light

19297,haloacetamides hams an emerging class of disinfection by products have received increasing attention due to their elevated cyto and genotoxicity however only limited information is available regarding the iodinated analogues this study investigated the formation and speciation of iodinated haloacetamides i hams and their chlorinated brominated analogues during the chloramination of bromide and or iodide containing waters and a model compound solution over various time periods the rapid formation of diiodoacetamide diam was observed during chloramination of three simulated samples whereas brominated br hams and chlorinated haloacetamides cl hams increased slowly with increasing reaction time to further understand the differences in the formation of hams containing different halogens experiments with the model compound asparagine in the presence absence of iodide were conducted moreover iodine utilisation factors and iodine incorporation factors were observed to increase significantly faster and were substantially higher than those of bromine this implied that compared with bromide iodide has substantially greater potential to be transformed to the corresponding hams during chloramination similar to that of other classes of dbps that is i hams formed faster than the other species investigated including cl hams and br hams in the early reaction stages 0 3 h the effect of the bromide iodide ratio i e constant iodide increasing bromide on i ham formation was also examined with increasing bromide iodide ratio the formation of br hams increased and dichloroacetamide decreased but the formation of diam was largely unchanged this was consistent with the constant level of iodide in spite of the increasing bromide chlorine and ammonia are applied separately during chloramination in water treatment so the effect of pre chlorination before adding ammonia on the formation and speciation of i hams during in situ chloramination was also evaluated effective mitigation of diam formation with in situ chloramination was achieved and the efficiency improved with increasing pre chlorination time where iodide was oxidised to iodate the ham associated cytotoxicity was calculated to determine the change in toxicity at different reaction times bromide iodide ratios and pre chlorination times a similar trend as the formation of i hams was observed which increased rapidly in the first 3 h but decreased somewhat subsequently when the bromide iodide ratio and pre chlorination time was increased the calculated toxicity of the hams increased due to more formation of br hams and less cl hams and decreased due to less diam formation respectively graphical abstract image 1 keywords drinking water iodinated disinfection by products

more cytotoxic and genotoxic than their brominated and chlorinated analogues plewa et al 2004 richardson et al 2007 2008 toxicology studies of individual dbps suggested that iodinated hams i hams exhibit much higher toxicity than their chlorinated and brominated analogues plewa et al 2008 especially diiodoacetamide diam which had the highest chronic cytotoxicity of 87 investigated dbps plewa

and johnson 1986 many surface and ground waters have a relatively high iodide level due to salt water intrusion and or water pollution i e iodine containing x ray contrast agents richardson and ternes 2014 when dwtps use iodide containing source waters and chloramination disinfection i hams are likely formed and can become an important issue affecting the safety of the treated drinking water many studies regarding dbp formation usually involved the application of a sufficient disinfectant dose and relatively long contact times mostly 24 or 72 h bond et al 2012 however these conditions likely resulted in the obfuscation of the real formation potential of i hams in addition chloramination in practice often does not involve adding preformed nh2cl which is usually used in laboratory experiments but rather ammonia and chlorine are usually added separately which is referred to as in situ chloramination in situ chloramination is common for disinfection of drinking water and can prolong disinfectant contact time mitigating the formation of regulated dbps such as thms hayes larson and mitch 2010 the pre chlorination time of in situ chloramination likely impacts the formation and speciation of i hams as well as has been observed for i thms jones et al 2011 generally data regarding the formation and speciation of i hams for various contact times and chloramination schemes are lacking the aim of this study was to explore the formation of six dihalogenated hams including cl br and i hams during chloramination of iodide containing waters with a particular emphasis on the speciation of i hams by examining the extent of iodide utilisation and incorporation in addition the effects of key factors such as reaction time bromide iodide ratio and chloramination schemes were studied the ham associated cytotoxicity of the treated water was also evaluated the results presented herein are important for optimizing the operation of water treatment processes and design of chloramination disinfection at dwtps where iodide and organic precursors of hams are prevalent 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the dichloroacetamide dcam standard was obtained from alfa aesar karlsruhe germany br and i hams i e bromochloroacetamide bcam dibromoacetamide dbam ciam biam and diam were purchased from cansyn chem corp toronto canada asparagine asn 2 iodophenol and 4 iodophenol

obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china unless otherwise specified ultrapure water was prepared with a millipore milli q gradient water purification system 18 mώ cm ma usa a preformed nh2cl stock solution was freshly prepared before use by adding sodium hypochlorite dropwise to a stirred ammonium chloride solution titrated to ph 8 5 at a chlorine nitrogen molar ratio of 1

river shanghai china which was likely impacted by saltwater intrusion and water c was collected from the secondary effluent of a wastewater treatment plant in shanghai which used an inverted anaerobic anoxic oxic process once collected the water samples were filtered through a 0 22 μm glass fibre filter and stored at 4 c in the dark until use details of the water quality characteristics including doc dissolved organic nitrogen don ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm uv254 bromide and iodide of the three studied water samples are listed in table sm1 2 2 experimental procedures batch experiments were performed in 250 ml transparent glass volumetric bottles in the dark at 25 0 0 5 c the volatilisation of hams was negligible due to their high boiling points which are listed in table sm2 the ph of each solution was buffered at 6 0 0 2 with 10 mm phosphate to prevent ham hydrolysis during the experiments typically most dwtps disinfectant finished water at ph 7 or 8 however if settled water is disinfected after enhanced coagulation the ph may be 6 use of the latter ph level still allows one to evaluate the impact of different water quality and operational conditions on ham speciation for chloramination experiments preformed nh2cl was added to water samples a b and c at 5 mg l as cl2 and the samples were held from 0 5 to 24 h for reactions with model precursor preformed nh2cl 20 or 50 μm as cl2 was applied to the precursor compound solution 50 μm it should be noted that a low dose of nh2cl was selected to enhance the formation of i hams rather than cl hams in addition the disinfectant doses in previous formation potential tests were higher than the concentration that the same precursors are exposed to in actual water treatment plants which resulted in overestimating conversion yields bond et al 2012 to examine the formation of i hams at different bromide iodide ratios bromide was spiked at concentrations ranging from 2 to 20 μm above the background level while iodide was spiked up to 2 μm in each experiment after accounting for the ambient iodide present in the sample iodide bromide molar ratio of 10 100 in the us and canada richardson et al 2008 found on average range that the iodide was 4 3 0 2 22 molar ratio of the bromide and 7 5 0 4 35 by weight in this study water b had an iodide bromide molar ratio of 13 5 and a weight ratio of 21 when iodide or bromide was solely spiked during the chloramination of asn the concentration of iodide or bromide was 4 μm for in situ chloramination experiments the reactions were initiated by adding free chlorine 5 mg l and ammonium chloride was added at various times 0 2 5 5 and 15 min to the water samples to achieve a cl2 n mass ratio of 4 1 a typical ratio used at full scale dwtps and then kept in the dark for 24 h before the ham analysis note as each water had some background ammonia 0 12 0 29 mg l as n when free chlorine was added before the ammonium chloride the chlorine would have broken out the background ammonia it takes 7 6 mg l of chlorine to break out 1 0 mg l of ammonia nitrogen i e 0 9 2 2 mg l as cl2 in this study which would have consumed some of the free chlorine thus each water saw a somewhat different amount of chlorine i e 2 8 4 1 mg l after breakpoint was achieved the results were compared to those of chloramination by preformed nh2cl 2 3 analytical methods preformed nh2cl

231 nm as described previously bichsel and von gunten 2000 hams were immediately liquid liquid extracted into methyl tert butyl ether at selected time intervals and immediately subjected to analysis it should be noted that the nh2cl residuals of the samples for ham determination were not quenched as many quenching agents can decompose certain dbps that is why the samples were extracted immediately to minimize the time between sample collection and analysis hams were analysed using a gas chromatograph equipped with an electron capture detector gc ecd qp2010plus shimadzu corporation

quantification of cl and br hams ding and chu 2017 in this study besides cl and br hams the analysis of i hams was also achieved with gc ecd moreover to investigate the thermal stability of hams in the injection port low 100 c and high 200 c injector temperatures were used for comparison six hams did not show any decrease of peak area at injector temperatures of 200 c the limits of detection

ovary cells compared to a negative control after 72 h of exposure plewa et al 2008 toxicity risk analysis has been applied previously to assess the toxic effect of hams during reductive dehalogenation process chu et al 2016b other researchers have used similar approaches to study the effects of organic compound removal technologies on the predicted toxicity of treated water krasner et al 2016 chuang and mitch 2017 similar evaluation was also conducted in a recent study to investigate the contribution of acetaminophen a common pharmaceutical to the toxicity of water during disinfection ding et al 2018a 3 results and discussion 3 1 time dependent formation of hams during chloramination of simulated water samples as shown in fig 1 the time dependent formation of hams was observed in simulated water samples cl hams br hams and i hams were formed during chloramination in the presence of bromide and iodide after 24 h dcam was the most abundant ham species however the rapid formation of diam peaked at 3 h was observed initially during chloramination while dcam and bcam formed relatively slowly maximum at 24 h when the experiment was stopped according to fig 1a fig 1b and fig 1c the concentration of diam increased considerably in the first few hours up to 29 28 and 110 nm at 3 h in waters a b and c respectively and decreased somewhat with further reaction time to 20 20 and 80 nm in waters a b and c respectively the concentration of dcam was 40 20 and 80 nm at 3 h in waters a b and c respectively which increased over the 24 h experiment to 50 30 and 130 nm in waters a b and c respectively during chloramination iodide and bromide can be oxidised to form reactive halogen species iodide was quickly oxidised to hypoiodous acid hoi by nh2cl and further oxidation to io3 by nh2cl should have been negligible kumar et al 1986 bichsel and von gunten 1999 bromide was likely mainly oxidised to form bromochloramine nhbrcl a mixed haloamine bousher et al 1989 heeb et al 2014 allard et al 2018 once generated the reactive halogen species as well as nh2cl reacted with natural organic matter nom to form chlorinated brominated and iodinated dbps in kinetic competition with each other the fast decrease of hoi i2 was observed in the initial reaction time i e most hoi i2 was consumed at 6 h as shown in fig sm2 the apparent second order rate constants for the reaction of hoi with ham precursors are likely higher than those of nh2cl and nhbrcl therefore diam formed more rapidly than its chlorinated and brominated analogues it should be noted that the concentration of diam decreased after reaching a maximum but dcam and bcam increased over the 24 h once formed the hams can undergo hydrolysis to generate their corresponding haas chu et al 2009 ding et al 2018b thus there is a competition between hydrolysis and formation although cl hams and br hams hydrolyse faster than i hams ding et al 2018b their formation rates in the three water samples tested here were higher than their hydrolysis rates within 24 h in contrast diam had peak formation in the first few hours so the rate of hydrolysis was significantly higher than that of formation after the initial reaction phase and the gap extended as the reaction proceeded from fig 1a and b as reaction time increased from 0 5 to 3 h the iuf value increased from 1 7 to 3 5 and then decreased somewhat for water a and it increased from 1 0 to 3 0 then decreased somewhat for water b the increase in the buf value was slow 0 1 0 4 and 0 0 1 in the first 3 h 0 4 0 8 and 0 1 0 7 at 3 24 h for waters a and b respectively this indicated that compared with bromide iodide was more liable to be incorporated into hams in chloraminated waters similar results were obtained with water c fig 1c although the concentration of hams was higher which is consistent with its high don table sm1 fig sm3 note that the higher suva254 waters had lower dham formation fig sm3 this is in agreement with a previous study which found that dom of low aromaticity had higher dcam yields chu et al 2010 3 2 time dependent formation of hams during the chloramination of a model precursor to better understand the formation of i hams during chloramination a high yield ham precursor chu et al 2016a asn was investigated as shown in fig 2 a the chloramination of asn in the presence of iodide was conducted and the diam yield increased much faster initially than that of dcam this can be seen in fig 2a where the yield of diam peaked at 1 2 0 1 at 1 0 h and changed only slightly thereafter dcam was undetectable before or at 1 h and the yield of dcam was smaller at contact times of 2 0 h 0 8 0 1 at 2 h and at longer reaction times 3 h were hams predominated by dcam e g 2 3 0 2 at 24 h it should be noted that there was a time lag between dcam and diam formation due to the significant difference in the reactivity of hoi and nh2cl toward asn as shown in fig sm4a when the nh2cl dose was raised from 20 to 50 μm dcam was somewhat detected at 20 min not until 1 5 h for nh2cl dose of 20 μm this may be because the increased nh2cl dose somewhat accelerated the formation of dcam although the concentration of ciam was lower than that of diam it formed rapidly and reached a maximum in a short time fig 2a however when bromide was spiked in the absence of iodide the formation of brominated species was suppressed and dcam was predominant with dbam barely detected fig 2b in addition bcam formed slowly over time the trends in the formation and speciation of hams were similar when iodide and bromide were simultaneously spiked fig 2c although in the latter case a mixed bromoiodo species biam was formed at low concentrations this suggests that hoi out competed both nh2cl and nhbrcl for asn in the early stages of the treatment regardless of iodide levels 2 vs 4 μm thus i hams formed much more rapidly than the other hams which agreed with the previous observations of waters a b and c however compared with the results of the simulated samples the formation of br hams was much lower in the chloraminated asn solution which may be explained by differences in the ham precursors as shown in fig 2d huf i e iuf and buf were calculated for the chloramination of the asn solution containing iodide 4 μm and bromide 4 μm respectively the iuf value showed a rapid increase to 65 4 at 1 5 h and then plateaued whereas the buf value remained at approximately 0 before 1 5 h then increased gradually reaching a maximum of 6 7 at 24 h it should be noted that the maximum buf increased two fold from 6 7 to 14 3 as the nh2cl dose was increased to 50 μm but the maximum iuf decreased slightly from 65 4 to 54 0 at 1 5 h fig sm4d this is likely because most of the iodide in the water had already been used to form i hams and other i dbps so no further increase in iuf was expected as the nh2cl dose increased the utilisation of bromide during chloramination is much slower than that of iodide so higher doses of nh2cl could allow bromide to be utilised more efficiently resulting in a higher buf value at 24 h for a nh2cl dose of 20 μm iif reached a maximum of 191 5 at 1 h fig sm5 showing a predominance of diam at 1 h fig 2a then decreased with increasing reaction time whereas bif remained unchanged at 0 before 1 5 h then exhibited an initial increase and subsequently a small decrease fig sm5 the decreased iif in the later treatment stages was mainly due to the depletion of iodide and the continuous formation of dcam fig 2a in summary these results indicated that iodine has substantially greater potential to be transformed and form corresponding hams than bromine and chlorine during chloramination this is consistent with other research that shows that chloramines minimize the formation of chlorinated or brominated dbps and favors the formation of iodinated dbps bichsel and von gunten 1999 krasner et al 2006 in addition i hams formed faster than the other species cl hams br hams in the early treatment stages 3 3 influence of the bromide iodide ratio fig 3 shows the formation of i hams after 24 h of chloramination at different bromide iodide ratios note in richardson et al 2008 the average and maximum molar ratio was 4 3 and 22 0 respectively the bromide iodide molar ratios of 5 1 and 10 1 16 0 and 9 1 respectively bracket much of the aforementioned range in general the formation of br hams bcam dbam and biam increased with increasing bromide iodide ratio and a gradual decrease of dcam formation was observed however the concentration of diam remained relatively stable as the bromide iodide ratio increased this is not surprising as regardless of the bromide iodide ratio the concentration of iodide was always 2 0 μm the increase in brominated hams simply tracked the increase in bromide and thus the decrease in dcam regardless of the bromide iodide ratio diam was the most abundant i ham species formed during chloramination as shown in fig 3a the concentrations of bcam dbam and biam in water a significantly increased from 6 4 0 5 to 11 1 0 8 nm 3 2 0 2 to 11 8 0 9 nm and 3 8 0 3 to 16 8 1 3 nm respectively in contrast the concentration of dcam decreased from 49 4 3 6 to 42 8 3 2 nm as the bromide iodide ratio increased from 1 to 10 the influence of the bromide iodide ratio on the formation of dcam diam and biam showed similar trends in all four water samples whereas the trends of the other hams species bcam dbam and ciam varied between samples at higher bromide iodide ratios more bcam was formed in water a fig 3a and asn solution fig 3d but no significant change was observed in bcam concentration in waters b fig 3b or c fig 3c dbam increased across the tested range of bromide iodide ratio for water a fig 3a water b fig 3b and asn solution fig 3d while the opposite was true for water c fig 3c as for water a fig 3a the concentration of ciam increased from 6 6 0 5 to 19 1 1 5 nm as the bromide iodide ratio increased from 1 to 10 however the formation of ciam in the other three water samples was unchanged or even decreased slightly as the bromide iodide ratio was increased 3 4 the effect of pre chlorination time on i ham formation during in situ chloramination as shown in fig 4 a when chlorine and ammonium were added simultaneously to water a i e pre chlorination time 0 reduced diam formation was observed compared to that of the preformed nh2cl trial when preformed nh2cl was applied the oxidation of hoi to io3 is negligible due to the weak oxidation strength of nh2cl and the faster reactions of hoi with nom but the oxidation of hoi to io3 is more significant during pre chlorination which minimizes the formation of i dbps during post chloramination bichsel and von gunten 1999 in addition enhanced dcam formation was observed with preformed nh2cl or 0 pre chlorination time this is consistent with previous studies where short pre chlorination times favour the formation of dcam chu et al 2012b chuang et al 2015 huang et al 2017 compared with preformed nh2cl more importantly the presence of bromide could facilitate the oxidation of iodide to io3 according to criquet et al 2012 s study thus the reaction between hoi and ham precursors during post chloramination was significantly hindered by bromide during pre chlorination resulting in a large decrease of hoi and thus diam concentration as expected the formation of diam was decreased with increasing pre chlorination time because of the larger amount of iodide oxidised to io3 as shown in fig sm6 e g at 15 min 75 of the iodide was oxidised to iodate for water b notably the concentration of dcam also decreased with increasing free chlorine contact time the oxidation of nom at longer pre chlorination times resulted in less oxidant remaining for the formation of nh2cl when ammonium was added fig sm7 based on the amount of chlorine added the cl2 n weight ratio for 0 pre chlorination was 4 1 a typical ratio used full scale at 15 min the natural waters had 1 2 the cl2 residual which meant chloramines would have formed but at a 2 1 weight ratio either scenario would have produced nh2cl but the latter with more free ammonia present during chloramination nh2cl is in equilibrium with free cl2 however that will be curtailed by the presence of free ammonia thus may have impacted dcam formation hong et al 2007 studied the impact of free ammonia and chloramines on dichloroacetic acid formation on the other hand the formed dcam can react with chlorine to form n chloro dcam during pre chlorination yu and reckhow 2017 decreasing the dcam concentration as pre chlorination time increased moreover ham precursors may transform to non ham precursors during pre chlorination through interactions with various reactive halogen species furthermore pre chlorination had little effect on the formation of biam and ciam pre chlorination reduced the amount of hoi so less i hams formed over all specifically less of the iodinated species but no effect on the two monoiodo species perhaps there was sufficient hoi present to form monoiodo hams but not enough to form the diiodo species as illustrated in fig 4d the concentration of both dcam and diam decreased significantly with increasing pre chlorination time from 0 to 15 min in experiments with asn in this case br hams formed in low concentration despite the pre chlorination time which was in agreement with the results presented in section 3 1 generally in situ chloramination was effective in controlling the formation of total dham in the water containing iodide and bromide and the control efficiency rose with increasing pre chlorination time 3 5 calculated toxicity of hams fig 5 shows the calculated cytotoxicity of hams during the chloramination of different waters for varied reaction times generally the calculated toxicity of hams in chloraminated waters reached a maximum at approximately 3 h then decreased somewhat afterward this trend is consistent with the changes of the i ham concentrations initial increase and subsequent decease or plateauing figs 1 and 2 because i hams mostly diam exhibit considerably higher toxicity compared with their chlorinated and brominated analogues table sm2 constituting more than 97 of the calculated toxicity fig sm8 diam was the greatest contributor to the total calculated toxicity followed by ciam and biam although the percentage contribution of bcam was higher than that of biam at longer reaction times for water c and asn it is should be mentioned that although dcam dominated on a molar basis at longer reaction times 6 h fig 1 it only constituted a very small proportion of the calculated toxicity due to its low cytotoxicity 0 1 0 1 0 1 and 0 3 at 24 h for water a water b water c and asn respectively it should also be noted that in the reaction time range of 3 24 h the percentage contribution of i hams decreased slightly owing to their hydrolysis and continuous formation of cl and br hams fig sm8 as mentioned previously section 3 3 diam formation was largely unchanged while cl ham shifted to br hams as the bromide iodide ratio increased and the cytotoxicity of br hams are more than 2 orders of magnitude higher than those of cl hams table sm2 therefore the calculated toxicity of the hams increased correspondingly when the bromide iodide ratio increased from 1 to 10 as shown in fig 6 it should be noted that the calculated toxicity of hams slightly declined at the bromide iodide ratio of 3 in the chloraminated asn solution due to the large decrease of cl hams and relatively small increase of br hams fig 6 as shown in fig 7 compared with the application of preformed nh2cl the calculated toxicity of hams was significantly reduced for in situ chloramination due to the effective mitigation of diam formation which decreased with increasing pre chlorination time the cytotoxicity calculation has been employed extensively previously by other researchers providing us a convenient way to compare dbp associated toxicity across different studies however biological assays are needed to get a more comprehensive understanding about the toxicity of chloraminated iodide containing waters in future studies 4 conclusions the formation of i hams ciam biam and diam was observed during the chloramination of three simulated water samples diam formed rapidly during the initial reaction time 3 h and subsequently decreased somewhat whereas the formation of cl hams and br hams dcam bcam and dbam increased slowly with increasing reaction time with the concentration of i hams significantly higher than that of br hams the rapid formation of i hams was also observed during the chloramination of asn the iuf and iif values increased significantly faster and were substantially higher than the buf and bif values indicating that iodine has greater potential to be incorporated and form the corresponding dham than bromine or chlorine during chloramination this is similar to what is observed for other classes of dbps with increasing bromide iodide ratio i e constant iodide increasing bromide the formation of br hams increased and dcam decreased however the formation diam was largely unchanged consistent with the constant iodide in spite of the increasing bromide however the influence of the bromide iodide ratio on the formation of bcam dbam and ciam varied depending on the water sample when chlorine and ammonium were applied separately in situ chloramination the formation of diam substantially decreased with increasing pre chlorination time and the formation of dcam was significantly reduced at longer free chlorine contact times with longer free chlorine contact times more of the hoi was oxidised to io3 and thus less diam formation diam is the greatest contributor to the calculated cytotoxicity of the hams and ham associated cytotoxicity showed an initial increase followed by a subsequent somewhat decreasing trend when the bromide iodide ratio and pre chlorination time was increased the calculated toxicity of hams increased and decreased respectively the first due to more formation of brominated hams and less chlorinated hams the second due to less diam formation acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china no 51822808 51578389 51778445 the national major science and

19297,haloacetamides hams an emerging class of disinfection by products have received increasing attention due to their elevated cyto and genotoxicity however only limited information is available regarding the iodinated analogues this study investigated the formation and speciation of iodinated haloacetamides i hams and their chlorinated brominated analogues during the chloramination of bromide and or iodide containing waters and a model compound solution over various time periods the rapid formation of diiodoacetamide diam was observed during chloramination of three simulated samples whereas brominated br hams and chlorinated haloacetamides cl hams increased slowly with increasing reaction time to further understand the differences in the formation of hams containing different halogens experiments with the model compound asparagine in the presence absence of iodide were conducted moreover iodine utilisation factors and iodine incorporation factors were observed to increase significantly faster and were substantially higher than those of bromine this implied that compared with bromide iodide has substantially greater potential to be transformed to the corresponding hams during chloramination similar to that of other classes of dbps that is i hams formed faster than the other species investigated including cl hams and br hams in the early reaction stages 0 3 h the effect of the bromide iodide ratio i e constant iodide increasing bromide on i ham formation was also examined with increasing bromide iodide ratio the formation of br hams increased and dichloroacetamide decreased but the formation of diam was largely unchanged this was consistent with the constant level of iodide in spite of the increasing bromide chlorine and ammonia are applied separately during chloramination in water treatment so the effect of pre chlorination before adding ammonia on the formation and speciation of i hams during in situ chloramination was also evaluated effective mitigation of diam formation with in situ chloramination was achieved and the efficiency improved with increasing pre chlorination time where iodide was oxidised to iodate the ham associated cytotoxicity was calculated to determine the change in toxicity at different reaction times bromide iodide ratios and pre chlorination times a similar trend as the formation of i hams was observed which increased rapidly in the first 3 h but decreased somewhat subsequently when the bromide iodide ratio and pre chlorination time was increased the calculated toxicity of the hams increased due to more formation of br hams and less cl hams and decreased due to less diam formation respectively graphical abstract image 1 keywords drinking water iodinated disinfection by products

haloacetic acids haas plewa et al 2008 the formation of hams is of growing concern their elevated toxicity was also reported in a metabonomic study zhang et al 2013 generally iodinated dbps i dbps are more cytotoxic and genotoxic than their brominated and chlorinated analogues plewa et al 2004 richardson et al 2007 2008 toxicology studies of individual dbps suggested that iodinated hams i hams exhibit much higher toxicity than their chlorinated and brominated analogues plewa et al 2008 especially diiodoacetamide diam which had the highest chronic cytotoxicity of 87 investigated dbps plewa

hypoiodous acid hoi which can further react with organic precursors to form i dbps ding and zhang 2009 zhu and zhang 2016 whereas cl2 can further oxidise a portion of the hoi species to form iodate io3 a sink for the iodide bichsel and von gunten 1999 a survey across the us and canada showed that iodide concentrations in water sources ranged from 0 4 to 104 μg l with a median of 10 3 μg l fuge and johnson 1986 many surface and ground waters have a relatively high iodide level due to salt water intrusion and or water pollution i e iodine containing x ray contrast agents richardson and ternes 2014 when dwtps use iodide containing source waters and chloramination disinfection i hams are likely formed and can become an important issue affecting the safety of the treated drinking water many studies regarding dbp formation usually involved the application of a sufficient disinfectant dose and relatively long contact times mostly 24 or 72 h bond et al 2012 however these conditions likely resulted in the obfuscation of the real formation potential of i hams in addition chloramination in practice often does not involve adding preformed nh2cl which is usually used in laboratory experiments but rather ammonia and chlorine are usually added separately which is referred to as in situ chloramination in situ chloramination is common for disinfection of drinking water and can prolong disinfectant contact time mitigating the formation of regulated dbps such as thms hayes larson and mitch 2010 the pre chlorination time of in situ chloramination likely impacts the formation and speciation of i hams as well as has been observed for i thms jones et al 2011 generally data regarding the formation and speciation of i hams for various contact times and chloramination schemes are lacking the aim of this study was to explore the formation of six dihalogenated hams including cl br and i hams during chloramination of iodide containing waters with a particular emphasis on the speciation of i hams by examining the extent of iodide utilisation and incorporation in addition the effects of key factors such as reaction time bromide iodide ratio and chloramination schemes were studied the ham associated cytotoxicity of the treated water was also evaluated the results presented herein are important for optimizing the operation of water treatment processes and design of chloramination disinfection at dwtps where iodide and organic precursors of hams are prevalent 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the dichloroacetamide dcam standard was obtained from alfa aesar

river shanghai china which was likely impacted by saltwater intrusion and water c was collected from the secondary effluent of a wastewater treatment plant in shanghai which used an inverted anaerobic anoxic oxic process once collected the water samples were filtered through a 0 22 μm glass fibre filter and stored at 4 c in the dark until use details of the water quality characteristics including doc dissolved organic nitrogen don ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm uv254 bromide and iodide of the three studied water samples are listed in table sm1 2 2 experimental procedures batch experiments were performed in 250 ml transparent glass volumetric bottles in the dark at 25 0 0 5 c the volatilisation of hams was negligible due to their high boiling points which are listed in table sm2 the ph of each solution was buffered at 6 0 0 2 with 10 mm phosphate to prevent ham hydrolysis during the experiments typically most dwtps disinfectant finished water at ph 7 or 8 however if settled water is disinfected after enhanced coagulation the ph may be 6 use of the latter ph level still allows one to evaluate the impact of different water quality and operational conditions on ham speciation for chloramination experiments preformed nh2cl was added to water samples a b and c at 5 mg l as cl2 and the samples were held from 0 5 to 24 h for reactions with model precursor preformed nh2cl 20 or 50 μm as cl2 was applied to the precursor compound solution 50 μm it should be noted that a low dose of nh2cl was selected to enhance the formation of i hams rather than cl hams in addition the disinfectant doses in previous formation potential tests were higher than the concentration that the same precursors are exposed to in actual water treatment plants which resulted in overestimating conversion yields bond et al 2012 to examine the formation of i hams at different bromide iodide ratios bromide was spiked at concentrations ranging from 2 to 20 μm above the background level while iodide was spiked up to 2 μm in each experiment after accounting for the ambient iodide present in the sample iodide bromide molar ratio of 10 100 in the us and canada richardson et al 2008 found on average range that the iodide was 4 3 0 2 22 molar ratio of the bromide and 7 5 0 4 35 by weight in this study water b had an iodide bromide molar ratio of 13 5 and a weight ratio of 21 when iodide or bromide was solely spiked during the chloramination of asn the concentration of iodide or bromide was 4 μm for in situ chloramination experiments the reactions were initiated by adding free chlorine 5 mg l and ammonium chloride was added at various times 0 2 5 5 and 15 min to the water samples to achieve a cl2 n mass ratio of 4 1 a typical ratio used at full scale dwtps and then kept in the dark for 24 h before the ham analysis note as each water had some background ammonia 0 12 0 29 mg l as n when free chlorine was added before the ammonium chloride the chlorine would have broken out the background ammonia it takes 7 6 mg l of chlorine to break out 1 0 mg l of ammonia nitrogen i e 0 9 2 2 mg l as cl2 in this study which would have consumed some of the free chlorine thus each water saw a somewhat different amount of chlorine i e 2 8 4 1 mg l after breakpoint was achieved the results were compared to those of chloramination by preformed nh2cl 2 3 analytical methods preformed nh2cl

231 nm as described previously bichsel and von gunten 2000 hams were immediately liquid liquid extracted into methyl tert butyl ether at selected time intervals and immediately subjected to analysis it should be noted that the nh2cl residuals of the samples for ham determination were not quenched as many quenching agents can decompose certain dbps that is why the samples were extracted immediately to minimize the time between sample collection and analysis hams were analysed using a gas chromatograph equipped with an electron capture detector gc ecd qp2010plus shimadzu corporation

quantification of cl and br hams ding and chu 2017 in this study besides cl and br hams the analysis of i hams was also achieved with gc ecd moreover to investigate the thermal stability of hams in the injection port low 100 c and high 200 c injector temperatures were used for comparison six hams did not show any decrease of peak area at injector temperatures of 200 c the limits of detection

process chu et al 2016b other researchers have used similar approaches to study the effects of organic compound removal technologies on the predicted toxicity of treated water krasner et al 2016 chuang and mitch 2017 similar evaluation was also conducted in a recent study to investigate the contribution of acetaminophen a common pharmaceutical to the toxicity of water during disinfection ding et al 2018a 3 results and discussion 3 1 time dependent formation of hams during chloramination of simulated water samples as shown in fig 1 the time dependent formation of hams was observed in simulated water samples cl hams br hams and i hams were formed during chloramination in the presence of bromide and iodide after 24 h dcam was the most abundant ham species however the rapid formation of diam peaked at 3 h was observed initially during chloramination while dcam and bcam formed relatively slowly maximum at 24 h when the experiment was stopped according to fig 1a fig 1b and fig 1c the concentration of diam increased considerably in the first few hours up to 29 28 and 110 nm at 3 h in waters a b and c respectively and decreased somewhat with further reaction time to 20 20 and 80 nm in waters a b and c respectively the concentration of dcam was 40 20 and 80 nm at 3 h in waters a b and c respectively which increased over the 24 h experiment to 50 30 and 130 nm in waters a b and c respectively during chloramination iodide and bromide can be oxidised to form reactive halogen species iodide was quickly oxidised to hypoiodous acid hoi by nh2cl and further oxidation to io3 by nh2cl should have been negligible kumar et al 1986 bichsel and von gunten 1999 bromide was likely mainly oxidised to form bromochloramine nhbrcl a mixed haloamine bousher et al 1989 heeb et al 2014 allard et al 2018 once generated the reactive halogen species as well as nh2cl reacted with natural organic matter nom to form chlorinated brominated and iodinated dbps in kinetic competition with each other the fast decrease of hoi i2 was observed in the initial reaction time i e most hoi i2 was consumed at 6 h as shown in fig sm2 the apparent second order rate constants for the reaction of hoi with ham precursors are likely higher than those of nh2cl and nhbrcl therefore diam formed more rapidly than its chlorinated and brominated analogues it should be noted that the concentration of diam decreased after reaching a maximum but dcam and bcam increased over the 24 h once formed the hams can undergo hydrolysis to generate their corresponding haas chu et al 2009 ding et al 2018b thus there is a competition between hydrolysis and formation although cl hams and br hams hydrolyse faster than i hams ding et al 2018b their formation rates in the three water samples tested here were higher than their hydrolysis rates within 24 h in contrast diam had peak formation in the first few hours so the rate of hydrolysis was significantly higher than that of formation after the initial reaction phase and the gap extended as the reaction proceeded from fig 1a and b as reaction time increased from 0 5 to 3 h the iuf value increased from 1 7 to 3 5 and then decreased somewhat for water a and it increased from 1 0 to 3 0 then decreased somewhat for water b the increase in the buf value was slow 0 1 0 4 and 0 0 1 in the first 3 h 0 4 0 8 and 0 1 0 7 at 3 24 h for waters a and b respectively this indicated that compared with bromide iodide was more liable to be incorporated into hams in chloraminated waters similar results were obtained with water c fig 1c although the concentration of hams was higher which is consistent with its high don table sm1 fig sm3 note that the higher suva254 waters had lower dham formation fig sm3 this is in agreement with a previous study which found that dom of low aromaticity had higher dcam yields chu et al 2010 3 2 time dependent formation of hams during the chloramination of a model precursor to better understand the formation of i hams during chloramination a high yield ham precursor chu et al 2016a asn was investigated as shown in fig 2 a the chloramination of asn in the presence of iodide was conducted and the diam yield increased much faster initially than that of dcam this can be seen in fig 2a where the yield of diam peaked at 1 2 0 1 at 1 0 h and changed only slightly thereafter dcam was undetectable before or at 1 h and the yield of dcam was smaller at contact times of 2 0 h 0 8 0 1 at 2 h and at longer reaction times 3 h were hams predominated by dcam e g 2 3 0 2 at 24 h it should be noted that there was a time lag between dcam and diam formation due to the significant difference in the reactivity of hoi and nh2cl toward asn as shown in fig sm4a when the nh2cl dose was raised from 20 to 50 μm dcam was somewhat detected at 20 min not until 1 5 h for nh2cl dose of 20 μm this may be because the increased nh2cl dose somewhat accelerated the formation of dcam although the concentration of ciam was lower than that of diam it formed rapidly and reached a maximum in a short time fig 2a however when bromide was spiked in the absence of iodide the formation of brominated species was suppressed and dcam was predominant with dbam barely detected fig 2b in addition bcam formed slowly over time the trends in the formation and speciation of hams were similar when iodide and bromide were simultaneously spiked fig 2c although in the latter case a mixed bromoiodo species biam was formed at low concentrations this suggests that hoi out competed both nh2cl and nhbrcl for asn in the early stages of the treatment regardless of iodide levels 2 vs 4 μm thus i hams formed much more rapidly than the other hams which agreed with the previous observations of waters a b and c however compared with the results of the simulated samples the formation of br hams was much lower in the chloraminated asn solution which may be explained by differences in the ham precursors as shown in fig 2d huf i e iuf and buf were calculated for the chloramination of the asn solution containing iodide 4 μm and bromide 4 μm respectively the iuf value showed a rapid increase to 65 4 at 1 5 h and then plateaued whereas the buf value remained at approximately 0 before 1 5 h then increased gradually reaching a maximum of 6 7 at 24 h it should be noted that the maximum buf increased two fold from 6 7 to 14 3 as the nh2cl dose was increased to 50 μm but the maximum iuf decreased slightly from 65 4 to 54 0 at 1 5 h fig sm4d this is likely because most of the iodide in the water had already been used to form i hams and other i dbps so no further increase in iuf was expected as the nh2cl dose increased the utilisation of bromide during chloramination is much slower than that of iodide so higher doses of nh2cl could allow bromide to be utilised more efficiently resulting in a higher buf value at 24 h for a nh2cl dose of 20 μm iif reached a maximum of 191 5 at 1 h fig sm5 showing a predominance of diam at 1 h fig 2a then decreased with increasing reaction time whereas bif remained unchanged at 0 before 1 5 h then exhibited an initial increase and subsequently a small decrease fig sm5 the decreased iif in the later treatment stages was mainly due to the depletion of iodide and the continuous formation of dcam fig 2a in summary these results indicated that iodine has substantially greater potential to be transformed and form corresponding hams than bromine and chlorine during chloramination this is consistent with other research that shows that chloramines minimize the formation of chlorinated or brominated dbps and favors the formation of iodinated dbps bichsel and von gunten 1999 krasner et al 2006 in addition i hams formed faster than the other species cl hams br hams in the early treatment stages 3 3 influence of the bromide iodide ratio fig 3 shows the formation of i hams after 24 h of chloramination at different bromide iodide ratios note in richardson et al 2008 the average and maximum molar ratio was 4 3 and 22 0 respectively the bromide iodide molar ratios of 5 1 and 10 1 16 0 and 9 1 respectively bracket much of the aforementioned range in general the formation of br hams bcam dbam and biam increased with increasing bromide iodide ratio and a gradual decrease of dcam formation was observed however the concentration of diam remained relatively stable as the bromide iodide ratio increased this is not surprising as regardless of the bromide iodide ratio the concentration of iodide was always 2 0 μm the increase in brominated hams simply tracked the increase in bromide and thus the decrease in dcam regardless of the bromide iodide ratio diam was the most abundant i ham species formed during chloramination as shown in fig 3a the concentrations of bcam dbam and biam in water a significantly increased from 6 4 0 5 to 11 1 0 8 nm 3 2 0 2 to 11 8 0 9 nm and 3 8 0 3 to 16 8 1 3 nm respectively in contrast the concentration of dcam decreased from 49 4 3 6 to 42 8 3 2 nm as the bromide iodide ratio increased from 1 to 10 the influence of the bromide iodide ratio on the formation of dcam diam and biam showed similar trends in all four water samples whereas the trends of the other hams species bcam dbam and ciam varied between samples at higher bromide iodide ratios more bcam was formed in water a fig 3a and asn solution fig 3d but no significant change was observed in bcam concentration in waters b fig 3b or c fig 3c dbam increased across the tested range of bromide iodide ratio for water a fig 3a water b fig 3b and asn solution fig 3d while the opposite was true for water c fig 3c as for water a fig 3a the concentration of ciam increased from 6 6 0 5 to 19 1 1 5 nm as the bromide iodide ratio increased from 1 to 10 however the formation of ciam in the other three water samples was unchanged or even decreased slightly as the bromide iodide ratio was increased 3 4 the effect of pre chlorination time on i ham formation during in situ chloramination as shown in fig 4 a when chlorine and ammonium were added simultaneously to water a i e pre chlorination time 0 reduced diam formation was observed compared to that of the preformed nh2cl trial when preformed nh2cl was applied the oxidation of hoi to io3 is negligible due to the weak oxidation strength of nh2cl and the faster reactions of hoi with nom but the oxidation of hoi to io3 is more significant during pre chlorination which minimizes the formation of i dbps during post chloramination bichsel and von gunten 1999 in addition enhanced dcam formation was observed with preformed nh2cl or 0 pre chlorination time this is consistent with previous studies where short pre chlorination times favour the formation of dcam chu et al 2012b chuang et al 2015 huang et al 2017 compared with preformed nh2cl more importantly the presence of bromide could facilitate the oxidation of iodide to io3 according to criquet et al 2012 s study thus the reaction between hoi and ham precursors during post chloramination was significantly hindered by bromide during pre chlorination resulting in a large decrease of hoi and thus diam concentration as expected the formation of diam was decreased with increasing pre chlorination time because of the larger amount of iodide oxidised to io3 as shown in fig sm6 e g at 15 min 75 of the iodide was oxidised to iodate for water b notably the concentration of dcam also decreased with increasing free chlorine contact time the oxidation of nom at longer pre chlorination times resulted in less oxidant remaining for the formation of nh2cl when ammonium was added fig sm7 based on the amount of chlorine added the cl2 n weight ratio for 0 pre chlorination was 4 1 a typical ratio used full scale at 15 min the natural waters had 1 2 the cl2 residual which meant chloramines would have formed but at a 2 1 weight ratio either scenario would have produced nh2cl but the latter with more free ammonia present during chloramination nh2cl is in equilibrium with free cl2 however that will be curtailed by the presence of free ammonia thus may have impacted dcam formation hong et al 2007 studied the impact of free ammonia and chloramines on dichloroacetic acid formation on the other hand the formed dcam can react with chlorine to form n chloro dcam during pre chlorination yu and reckhow 2017 decreasing the dcam concentration as pre chlorination time increased moreover ham precursors may transform to non ham precursors during pre chlorination through interactions with various reactive halogen species furthermore pre chlorination had little effect on the formation of biam and ciam pre chlorination reduced the amount of hoi so less i hams formed over all specifically less of the iodinated species but no effect on the two monoiodo species perhaps there was sufficient hoi present to form monoiodo hams but not enough to form the diiodo species as illustrated in fig 4d the concentration of both dcam and diam decreased significantly with increasing pre chlorination time from 0 to 15 min in experiments with asn in this case br hams formed in low concentration despite the pre chlorination time which was in agreement with the results presented in section 3 1 generally in situ chloramination was effective in controlling the formation of total dham in the water containing iodide and bromide and the control efficiency rose with increasing pre chlorination time 3 5 calculated toxicity of hams fig 5 shows the calculated cytotoxicity of hams during the chloramination of different waters for varied reaction times generally the calculated toxicity of hams in chloraminated waters reached a maximum at approximately 3 h then decreased somewhat afterward this trend is consistent with the changes of the i ham concentrations initial increase and subsequent decease or plateauing figs 1 and 2 because i hams mostly diam exhibit considerably higher toxicity compared with their chlorinated and brominated analogues table sm2 constituting more than 97 of the calculated toxicity fig sm8 diam was the greatest contributor to the total calculated toxicity followed by ciam and biam although the percentage contribution of bcam was higher than that of biam at longer reaction times for water c and asn it is should be mentioned that although dcam dominated on a molar basis at longer reaction times 6 h fig 1 it only constituted a very small proportion of the calculated toxicity due to its low cytotoxicity 0 1 0 1 0 1 and 0 3 at 24 h for water a water b water c and asn respectively it should also be noted that in the reaction time range of 3 24 h the percentage contribution of i hams decreased slightly owing to their hydrolysis and continuous formation of cl and br hams fig sm8 as mentioned previously section 3 3 diam formation was largely unchanged while cl ham shifted to br hams as the bromide iodide ratio increased and the cytotoxicity of br hams are more than 2 orders of magnitude higher than those of cl hams table sm2 therefore the calculated toxicity of the hams increased correspondingly when the bromide iodide ratio increased from 1 to 10 as shown in fig 6 it should be noted that the calculated toxicity of hams slightly declined at the bromide iodide ratio of 3 in the chloraminated asn solution due to the large decrease of cl hams and relatively small increase of br hams fig 6 as shown in fig 7 compared with the application of preformed nh2cl the calculated toxicity of hams was significantly reduced for in situ chloramination due to the effective mitigation of diam formation which decreased with increasing pre chlorination time the cytotoxicity calculation has been employed extensively previously by other researchers providing us a convenient way to compare dbp associated toxicity across different studies however biological assays are needed to get a more comprehensive understanding about the toxicity of chloraminated iodide containing waters in future studies 4 conclusions the formation of i hams ciam biam and diam was observed during the chloramination of three simulated water samples diam formed rapidly during the initial reaction time 3 h and subsequently decreased somewhat whereas the formation of cl hams and br hams dcam bcam and dbam increased slowly with increasing reaction time with the concentration of i hams significantly higher than that of br hams the rapid formation of i hams was also observed during the chloramination of asn the iuf and iif values increased significantly faster and were substantially higher than the buf and bif values indicating that iodine has greater potential to be incorporated and form the corresponding dham than bromine or chlorine during chloramination this is similar to what is observed for other classes of dbps with increasing bromide iodide ratio i e constant iodide increasing bromide the formation of br hams increased and dcam decreased however the formation diam was largely unchanged consistent with the constant iodide in spite of the increasing bromide however the influence of the bromide iodide ratio on the formation of bcam dbam and ciam varied depending on the water sample when chlorine and ammonium were applied separately in situ chloramination the formation of diam substantially decreased with increasing pre chlorination time and the formation of dcam was significantly reduced at longer free chlorine contact times with longer free chlorine contact times more of the hoi was oxidised to io3 and thus less diam formation diam is the greatest contributor to the calculated cytotoxicity of the hams and ham associated cytotoxicity showed an initial increase followed by a subsequent somewhat decreasing trend when the bromide iodide ratio and pre chlorination time was increased the calculated toxicity of hams increased and decreased respectively the first due to more formation of brominated hams and less chlorinated hams the second due to less diam formation acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china no 51822808 51578389 51778445 the national major science and

19298,water reuse is of increasing relevance for water stressed regions but is often considered a contentious option research has shown that providing the public with information about reuse options can impact positively on its acceptability although such impacts can be confined to specific groups in this context there is growing interest in understanding the impact of different forms and mechanisms of communication with the public around reuse this contribution has investigated the use of video animations to communicate the safety of non potable recycled water schemes the aim of this study was to evaluate how different ways of framing messages about the safety of recycled water might impact on public attitudes participants were recruited in london n 689 uk and randomly allocated to test and control groups with the former being exposed to one of four video animations that used different frames to convey messages about recycled water safety surveys collected pre and post video message responses for dependent variables including the general acceptance of diverse non potable recycled water uses risk perceptions and trust the findings complement existing knowledge on the impacts of different types of messaging on public attitudes to reuse schemes with important evidence for the positive impact of water safety communications framed in terms of compliance with water quality requirements contrarily a positive attitudinal impact was not evident for safety message framed in terms of the selection of water treatment technology to remove contaminants nor in terms of non potable water risks relative to other every day risks the results are of value to water resource planners looking to develop communication resources as part of more comprehensive public engagement strategies for improving perceptions of water reuse importantly the findings help isolate the effects of specific message frames and inform the debate on whether an increased understanding of risk positively or negatively influences willingness to support water reuse schemes graphical abstract image 1 keywords non potable water recycled water communication message framing public attitudes 1 introduction the perceived benefits of early public engagement in the planning and design of water reuse schemes frijns et al 2016 hurlimann and dolnicar 2016 lee and tan 2016 are clearly supported by water reuse regulations and guidelines european commission 2016 nrmmc ephc ahmc 2006 usepa 2012 this aspiration for timely public engagement has also been informed by the experiences of both successful harris lovett et al 2015 and unsuccessful hurlimann and dolnicar 2010 reuse schemes involving both potable and non potable recycled water uses the evidence has consistently linked inadequate public engagement with low public support for or increased levels of resistance to reuse projects russell et al 2008 more inclusive dialogue about risks and benefits is often recommended to help understand public attitudes and to build public trust khan and gerrard 2006 the repurposing of wastewater for non potable uses is consistently evaluated by the public to be less contentious than its reuse for drinking water hurlimann and dolnicar 2016 however there are well recognised nuances within this general principle that relate acceptability to the degree of contact with or exposure to the water bruvold 1988 friedler et al 2006 hurlimann et al 2009 for example use of the water for higher exposure uses such as in swimming pools is likely to be less acceptable than for flushing toilets dolnicar and schäfer 2009 explanations for these differences draw from the psychology of contamination and disgust rozin et al 2015 wester et al 2016 and from cultural risk evaluations suggesting preferences for more pure uses marks et al 2008 these differences are well documented but can also vary depending on context as examples there are cases of overwhelming public acceptance for schemes involving potable reuse e g newater singapore mainali et al 2011 and underwhelming acceptance for uses such as toilet flushing buyukkamaci and alkan 2013 health risk fears can lie behind public concerns with specific evidence emerging from cases involving irrigated crops wu et al 2015 and cross contamination in household drinking water supplies hambly et al 2012 there is now a sizeable legacy of research that has engaged with the challenge of understanding the factors underpinning public acceptance bruvold 1988 dolnicar et al 2011 nancarrow et al 2008 ross et al 2014

greater extent on the information processing experience dolnicar et al 2010 russell et al 2008 as such there is keen interest in understanding communicative processes in particular how framing e g the careful selection or emphasis of certain pieces of information might influence how people make sense of water management communications dewulf et al 2009 2005 mankad 2012 for water reuse studies have shown positive impacts from providing information that adopts particular terminology menegaki et al 2009 simpson and stratton 2011 includes descriptions of water treatment processes dolnicar et al 2010 or identifies risks and benefits of recycled water price et al 2015 contrastingly research has shown no impact from providing additional information on pollutant levels fielding and roiko 2014 presently there remain limitations to knowledge of how specific communities might respond to different message framing and which modes of communication are more effective fielding and roiko 2014 rozin et al 2015 russell et al 2008 recent years have seen an increase in the deployment of graphical materials dolnicar et al 2010 and animations and videos in particular russell et al 2008 to present information about water reuse the associated benefits of using such media include improvements in accessibility and understanding ishii and boyer 2016 islam et al 2015 tang et al 2015 videos can help viewers grasp more complex resource management concepts krantz and monroe 2016 and the selection of certain images may help develop positive responses towards water augmentation projects dolnicar et al 2014 videos are an increasingly familiar information source and can enhance levels of interest and motivation arvai and louie 2014 such demonstrated benefits have led to the development of video animation resources discussing water management e g sydney water s tap video motion and kearnes 2014 and specifically for water reuse videos describing de facto indirect potable reuse downstream harris lovett et al 2015 direct potable reuse the ways of water watereuse 2014 and sewer mining dessin 2017 despite the growing use of video messaging scientific evaluations of video interventions are sparse arvai and louie 2014 this paper aims to examine the impact of message framing on public attitudes towards non potable water reuse through the use of video messages that selectively communicate information regarding the risk management of non potable recycled water use in london following the principles of framing to select some aspects of a perceived reality and make them more salient to promote a particular idea or problem entman 1993 the content of the different video messages used in this study included different focal characteristics depending on the frame being employed hallahan 1999 levin et al 1998 this paper therefore addresses the following questions 1 to what extent might the initial attitudes of the participants towards non potable recycled water be influenced by messages conveyed through video animations 2 to what extent might message framing variation in the focal characteristics of a message according to the frame being employed influence attitudinal change 3 to what extent might the impact of message framing be associated with initial levels of support for more contentious non potable water uses or demographic variables 4 how might messages about recycled water be improved to help meet the public s expectations with respect to the study location of london uk and how might video animations be used more effectively for engaging the public when developing recycled water schemes 2 methodology 2 1 participant recruitment participants were recruited for pre and post video message surveys from a database of over forty thousand london residents over 18 years of age the survey panel qualtrics worked with databases of participants including harder to reach demographic categories to select participants to take part based on similar studies using online panel based recruitment e g dolnicar et al 2014 the response rate was expected to be in the order of 15 20 however this was not specifically documented participants received a compensation payment at standard rates used by the survey company for the initial survey at time 1 t1 783 surveys were started and 753 completed using a minimum time completion filter to improve data quality set at the 10th percentile completion time 689 valid responses were received for the follow up survey t2 565 responses were started and 6 not completed using the minimum time filter 479 valid responses were received after matching valid responses from t1 and t2 the final sample of matched pairs was n 441 demographic data was collected for gender age ethnicity highest level of education and annual household income demographic characteristics of the valid t1 responses included a mean age of 42 42 sd 16 31 range 18 90 with 354 females 51 4 and 335 males 48 6 for ethnicity 73 1 identified as white british irish or other 9 6 as black or black british 8 1 as asian or british asian 4 6 as mixed ethic background and 4 5 as any other background these demographic proportions accorded well with the general london population over 18 years of age for age mean 43 39 and gender 48 8 male 51 2 female the sample was over representative for those identifying as white ethnicities 60 in london and those with university degrees 38 in london compared with 51 in the sample characteristics of the sample validly completing both stages included a mean age of 47 40 years sd 15 65 range 18 90 with 247 females 56 and 194 males 44 attrition rates varied for different sub groups and for example were higher for males those under 35 and those from mixed and asian or british asian ethnic backgrounds using cross tabulation pearson chi square the proportions for gender χ 2 2 816 df 1 p 0 093 ethnicity χ 2 3 973 df 5 p 0 553 annual income χ 2 0 506 df 5 p 0 992 and level of education χ 2 6 446 df 10 p 0 776 were not significantly different between the two sample points however the change in the distribution of participants between the age categories was statistically significantly χ 2 31 041 df 5 p 0 001 and the implications of this were explored in the analysis the final sample drawn from a database of london residents was of sufficient size to consider the possible representativeness with respect to the general london population aged over 18 of 6 4 million glaintelligence 2016 for claims made about proportions the confidence level was 95 5 error however given the known challenges associated with sampling biases in internet surveys and panel based recruitment van selm and jankowski 2006 potential methodological biases e g acquiescence and social desirability bias along with the biases identified in the demographic proportions of the data any such generalisation were drawn with caveats 2 2 materials survey and video design the independent variables were message frames which determined the selection of information for four different video messages the video messages were created using animation software and embedded in a qualtrics online survey instrument the videos were designed using sparkol s videoscribe software the survey instrument and videos were piloted to address design problems and to check interpretations of words and phrases de vaus 2002 the survey questions and video materials were also pre tested through consultation with a small number of water resource specialists and academics the survey and videos were updated based on these consultations and then piloted with a small sample of the public t1 n 56 t2 n 33 following this refinements were made to the question items and their wording based on cronbach s alpha scores qualitative feedback and comprehension check question results as an example a question about risk benefit trade offs was excluded following the review of cronbach alpha other changes included simplifying the wording of questions and modifying the survey flow and the sequence and timing of the animations in the videos these responses from the piloting were not included in the final analysis 2 2 1 experimental video messages the development and the selection of the frames used in the videos drew from the broader framing literature spanning psychology levin et al 1998 and sociology nisbet 2009 the message framing literature around water management and water reuse goodwin et al 2017 mankad 2012 menegaki et al 2009 rozin et al 2015 wester et al 2016 was then used to develop a conceptual message framing typology table 1 that linked contextual attribute and valance frames with a multi level framing of water resource management water reuse as a management intervention and water safety this typology provided an overarching framework for constructing the messages used in this study a general context framing message was developed which emphasises the water supply challenge for london and the potential role of non potable water reuse as a solution fig 1 the context frames used were informed by literature related to the role of water reuse in london s water supply e g aitken et al 2014 bell and aitken 2008 hills et al 2001 jeffrey and jefferson 2003 smith et al 2014 and the terminology used was informed by the water reuse communication literature specifically macpherson 2014 2011 menegaki et al 2009 motion and kearnes 2014 po et al 2005 simpson and stratton 2011 wrrf 2010 this general context message video duration of 1min 13s employed all three levels of context framing table 1 it described the context for water resource management including the existing water supply regime the influence of climate change and population growth and the potential for a future water supply deficit level 1 context framing it described the context of water reuse as a management intervention including potential benefits level 2 context framing and it described the context of water reuse safety through acknowledging potential risks from contaminants level 3 context framing in addition three alternative water safety attribute frames level 3 attribute framing were developed which added different focal characteristics to the general message 1 water quality compliance wherein the message emphasised that management practices ensure compliance with standards through monitoring sampling testing and reporting to protect human and environmental health from contaminants video duration 1min 37s 2 relative risk wherein the message emphasised that contaminants may be detected in recycled water but that exposure is relative to other every day exposures to similar contaminants such as those in personal care products video duration 1min 33s and 3 technology selection wherein the message emphasised that the selection of water treatment technology including biological treatment carbon filtration membrane filtration chemical oxidation and disinfection targets the removal of specific contaminants to protect human and environmental health video duration 1min 30s these three alternative attribute frames were developed by thematically reviewing water recycling studies focusing on public communications e g fielding and roiko 2014 goodwin et al 2017 harris lovett et al 2015 price et al 2015 roseth 2008 ross et al 2014 rozin et al 2015 wester et al 2016 2 2 2 dependent variables the surveys used likert type questions to quantify five dependent variables these variables were labelled 1 general acceptance 2 support 3 behavioural intentions e g willingness to use the water 4 risk perceptions and 5 trust see table 2 the question items used to measure each dependent variable were built on elicitation methods shown to be consistent and reliable measures aitken et al 2014 fielding and roiko 2014 nancarrow et al 2009 po et al 2005 price et al 2015 ross et al 2014 taking into account contextual specificities and issues identified during piloting a range of non potable water uses were included to span potential levels of exposure to recycled water using general classification methods e g low medium high bruvold 1988 friedler et al 2006 matos et al 2014 however through the aggregation of question items described below the dependent variables sought to summarise the participants general attitudes to non potable recycled water rather than towards specific uses for the water responses to individual question items were recorded using a 6 point scale 1 strongly disagree 2 disagree 3 neither agree nor disagree 4 agree 5 strongly agree and 6 don t know a low proportion of respondents selected don t know 3 and were re coded as neutral ambivalent 3 along with neither agree nor disagree for analysis to improve response validity some questions used reverse wording which were re coded for analysis for each respondent under each dependent variable the numerical scores for individual question items were added together norman 2010 using these aggregate values mean values and standard deviations were calculated for each message group for each dependent variable at each time stage so for the acceptance variable in the no message group at time 1 the mean was calculated through summing scores for all the participants in that group and dividing by the number of participants the internal consistency for all of the variables was evaluated with cronbach alpha to be satisfactory table 2 cronbach s alpha test is commonly referred to in water management e g ishii and boyer 2016 ross et al 2014 and risk research e g poortinga and pidgeon 2003 to measure the inter correlation of question items as an indicator of internal consistency debates on the usefulness and the interpretation of the alpha statistic permeate through the socio psychological literature cortina 1993 however for this study the statistic was considered suitable for the context 2 3 study procedure following consent to participate all participants completed the introductory survey stage with basic demographic questions and initial dependent variable measurements fig 2 participants were then randomly assigned to one of five message groups using inbuilt survey tool functionality to either watch a video animation or not control group with no message immediately following the videos a number of statements were used to gauge 1 how easy the video messages were to understand using the six point likert scale and 2 whether participants recognised the focal characteristics of the message to which they d been assigned the inclusion of comprehension checks followed islam et al 2015 for the latter participants were asks whether the video helped them understand about by selecting all that apply 1 water resource planning 2 water recycling 3 water quality compliance 4 comparing every day risks 5 water treatment technology or 6 anything else allowing for text entry these categorical data were used to help interpret the participants ability to recall and comprehend specificities of the messages by comparing the four message groups using pearson s chi squared test repeat measures were taken at two weeks with this interval selected with reference to related studies dolnicar et al 2010 price et al 2015 and following a similar methodology to roseth 2008 drawing from attitude change theory the approach assumed that 1 attitudes should remain stable in the absence of shock events krosnick and petty 1995 and 2 messages can initiate longer term attitude change if participants are motivated and able to process them dainton 2004 the study procedure acknowledged that attitudes could be affected by other issues coming into public attention after viewing the messages russell et al 2008 but a review of local weather and news media showed that water issues were not salient and were therefore unlikely to influence participants attitudes during the study period attitudes could have been influenced through reflecting on the topic after completing the initial survey roseth 2008 and the no message control group was used to help monitor for such effects 2 4 analysis all data were analysed using ibm spss statistics version 22 0 following the methodology of fielding and roiko 2014 outliers scores greater than 3 standard deviations above or below the mean were identified on the dependent variables and excluded following this the data for the five dependent variables were approximately normally distributed skewness and kurtosis between 2 for all variables moreover levene s test showed homogeneity of variance of the five variables the risk variable has the lower test statistic of p 0 556 therefore parametric statistics were considered appropriate for the analysis given the robustness of anova norman 2010 one way anova on the gain scores changes over time were used to explore whether there were differences between the five groups the hypothesis was that h1 after watching the videos there would be differences in attitudinal changes between each of the four video message groups when compared with the control group paired t tests were used for the matched samples to explore whether the dependent variables changed significantly over time within each of the message groups to explore any framing effect from varying the message content again one way anova was used but to compare only the four video message groups the hypothesis was that h2 there would be a difference between the four message groups n 350 and more specifically between each of the three messages containing specific focal characteristics when compared with the general video message group finally following the methodology of price et al 2015 the initial support for using recycled water in swimming areas was divided to form three groups initially supportive 168 neutral indifferent 85 and initially not supportive 113 the premise of this analysis was to consider whether the message framing might be influential on those initially neutral or not supportive support for use in swimming areas was selected for this analysis on the basis that this was the most contentious use with the highest degree of exposure to recycled water as initial support for uses such as toilet flushing was initially high there was limited scope to consider the change in views of those initially not supportive the hypothesis was that h3 initial levels of support would interact with the video message groups and the impact of the message frames using a univariate general linear model glm two way anova was used to evaluate the interaction between the initial support and the four video message groups for the five dependent variables 2 4 1 demographic weights and variables as attrition in younger age groups was found to be statistically significant between the surveys the influence of age in years was explored as a covariate when comparing the groups using ancova through a univariate glm moreover the possible influence of differences in the demographic composition of the sample was examined through weighting particularly with reference to the londoner population to consider the generalisability of findings weighting was achieved using spss weight cases function to adjust the composition of the sample based on the frequency of demographic data for age gender and ethnicity to be reflective of the proportions in the london population age and gender were explored as independent demographic variables as variations in both have been shown to be associated with differences in attitudes to science castell et al 2014 and differences in responses to message framing levin et al 1998 for example attitudes have been shown to be more impressionable at younger ages typically up to 25 years old krosnick et al 1989 although susceptibility to attitude change may increase again in late adulthood ajzen 2001 the age group categories used for analysis were 18 34 35 44 45 54 55 64 and over 65 two way anovas were conducted using univariate glm to explore interactions between the demographic categories and the message groups no firm hypotheses were made as to the expected nature of the interactions 3 results 3 1 initial general acceptance of non potable water reuse anova showed there was no significant differences in the initial attitudinal responses to the five dependent variables for the participants who went on to be randomly assigned to the five message groups this indicated that at t1 no group displayed any initial attitudinal differences compared with other groups before viewing a video message the dependent variable with the most variance at t1 was support f 1 440 1 272 p 0 280 η 2 0 012 whilst the least variance was for general acceptance f 1 440 0 679 p 0 607 η 2 0 006 the results for initial support and behavioural intentions t1 are summarised in fig 3 to help contextualise the participants responses with respect to the general patterns of agreement with respect to recycled water uses with different degrees of exposure the highest support was for the lowest exposure uses industrial uses 96 agreed and toilet flushing and garden watering 92 agreed the lowest initial support was for the highest exposure use use in recreation swimming areas 46 agreed the results for behavioural intentions followed a similar pattern with higher intentions to use the water for watering gardens and flushing toilets 91 agreed and lower intentions to swim in recycled water 41 agreed in this regard the results were broadly representative of previous research into public attitudes to non potable water reuse in a london context for example see aitken et al 2014 hills et al 2001 smith et al 2014 and therefore ecologically valid 3 2 impact of video messages the results showed that participants were engaged by the video messages and that some aspects of some participants attitudes changed over time depending on the group they were assigned to for the valid sample of matched pairs 441 the changes in attitude scores summated question items for each dependent variable for each participant for the four video message groups were compared with the control group to evaluate the impact of watching the videos firstly pearson s chi square tests showed that there were no statistically significant differences between the distribution of demographic characteristics of the five groups for gender χ 2 2 996 df 4 p 0 559 age χ 2 14 893 df 20 p 0 783 ethnicity χ 2 25 820 df 16 p 0 057 annual income χ 2 21 256 df 20 p 0 382 or level of education χ 2 47 159 df 40 p 0 203 as such no intra group weighting adjustments were made before comparing the five groups comparing the video messages to the control group showed both the compliance message and the general messages had statistically significant improvements for some attitude measurements results from the one way anova table 3 on gain scores showed significant interactions for four of the five dependent variables with small effects sizes η 2 0 02 follow up dunnett s t tests showed statistically significant improvements for the general message group when compared with the control group for the support p 0 026 and trust p 0 042 variables the results showed statistically significant improvements for the compliance group when compared to the control group for acceptance p 0 015 support p 0 031 and risk perceptions p 0 025 due to significant variation in the attrition rate between age groups from t1 to t2 the effect of age as a covariate was evaluated using ancova these results showed no change in the effect sizes for the five dependent variables table 3 3 2 1 message comprehension and impact the results for each message group were explored to see how well the messages were understood by participants in all cases a high proportion of participants 90 agreed with the statement the message was easy to understand with the highest agreement 97 in the general message group the comprehension results showed that participants responded to the water safety attribute frame manipulations comparing the responses from the four groups watching a video showed that the proportion selecting the appropriate statement was highest in the anticipated group the video helped me understand about water quality compliance was significantly higher in the water quality compliance group χ2 21 10 df 3 p 0 001 the video helped me understand about comparing every day risks was significantly higher in the relative risk group χ 2 48 80 df 3 p 0 001 and the video helped me understand about water treatment technology was significantly higher in the technology group χ2 22 06 df 3 p 0 001 the results for each message group were examined individually to determine how the dependent variables changed over time in the no message group there was evidence that the strength of acceptance decreased with paired samples t tests showing a statistically significant decrease in levels of acceptance t 90 2 319 p 0 023 and support t 90 2 068 p 0 041 further inspection of this result showed that these changes were largely due to the participants moving from strongly agree to agree and particularly for the lower exposure uses of toilet flushing and garden watering and industry use in the general message group paired samples t test results showed a significant positive change in trust t 86 2 833 p 0 006 finally in the water quality compliance group paired samples t tests showed a significant positive change in risk perceptions t 79 2 567 p 0 012 3 2 2 london weighting weighting cases so that the proportions were equivalent to the london population for age gender ethnicity level of education resulted in only the risk perception variable showing a significant interaction for the one way anova comparing the five message groups f 4 393 3 550 p 0 007 η 2 0 034 neither acceptance f 4 392 0 636 p 0 637 support f 4 392 0 744 p 0 563 behavioural intentions f 4 392 0 338 p 0 852 or the trust variable f 4 396 0 938 p 0 442 resulted in significant interactions 3 3 comparisons between message groups the results above show that when the groups are examined individually the general message and the compliance message appeared to have the greatest impact on respondents as evidenced by changes in dependent variables trust and risk perceptions however in order to better assess framing effects i e the role of the three message frames as opposed to the general message we also compared the four message groups to each other h2 one way anova showed a significant interaction for the trust variable f 3 345 2 919 p 0 034 η 2 0 025 and there was some indication of an interaction for risk perceptions with a small effects size f 3 342 2 521 p 0 056 η 2 0 022 the interactions were followed up using tukey s post hoc test to explore which groups were different this showed that there was no significant difference between the compliance message group and the general context message group however both the compliance message and the general messages performed better than the technology message which provides some evidence of a negative framing effect from the technology message it was hypothesised h3 that there would be an interaction between the video message groups based on participants initial levels of support for using recycled water for swimming areas particularly as there were high proportions of participants initially not supportive or neutral on this type of use however although there were significant differences between how the attitudes changed in these three initial support categories two way anova did not reveal a significant interaction with the video message groups the interaction was the strongest with the trust variable f 2 353 1 959 p 0 071 η 2 0 032 and weakest for risk perceptions f 2 354 1 263 p 0 274 η 2 0 021 inspection of the marginal means showed that the strongest positive changes were for the participants in the compliance message group n 30 for the acceptance support and risk perception variables for those who were initially not supportive however there was no evidence of a statistically significant framing effect considering the demographic variables of gender and age the only near significant interaction with a medium partial eta squared effect size 0 06 to emerge was for risk perceptions for the two way anova of message group and age category f 12 330 1 761 p 0 054 η 2 0 060 the follow up simple effects test with bonferroni corrections showed statistically significant differences only for the youngest age group category 18 34 where participants perceived less risk in the compliance message group compared with the technology message group mean difference 2 635 p 0 025 all other differences between the groups were less and not statistically significant for all other age categories whilst these differences were observed it is noted that there were small numbers of participants within the age group categories of each video message group based on these analyses the following summation of message impacts and framing effects is put forward table 4 the overall picture that emerged was that the general context message and the water quality compliance message had more impact on participants in contrast with the general context message and to some degree the compliance message the water treatment technology focal characteristic may have reduced the potential for the messages to have a positive impact on the participants attitudes 3 3 1 london weighting weighting cases so that the proportions were equivalent to the london population for age gender ethnicity level of education resulted in only the risk perception variable showing a significant interaction for the one way anova comparing the four video groups f 3 309 4 680 p 0 003 η 2 0 043 neither acceptance f 3 296 0 654 p 0 581 support f 3 297 0 591 p 0 621 behavioural intentions f 3 300 0 447 p 0 720 or the trust variable f 3 300 1 239 p 0 296 resulted in significant interactions on inspection of the tukey post hoc test results for the risk perception interaction both the general message p 0 020 and the compliance message p 0 018 had statistically significant improvement when compared to the technology message the interactions with age and gender categories were also explored using two way anova as with the unweighted sample there was a significant interaction between age categories and message group for risk perceptions f 12 349 2 355 p 0 006 η 2 0 075 and through inspection of the marginal means and simple effects tests a similar pattern of results emerged as with the unweighted sample 4 discussion in this study we investigated the impact of video messages and message framing on participants attitudes to non potable recycled water findings demonstrate that participants were engaged by the video messages and that some aspects of some participants attitudes did change over time depending on the group they were assigned to comparing the video messages to the control no message group showed that both the general context message and the water quality compliance messages resulted in improvements for some attitude measurements the impact was more pronounced in terms of decreasing perceptions of risk and increasing trust in management however results from the comparisons between groups showed that for the compliance message it is difficult to ascertain whether the added compliance frame had any impact over and above that of the general message following weighting of the sample to match demographic proportions in the london population the results pointed to implications for improving risk perceptions in the younger age groups with the difference in results also highlighting limitations to the method of participant recruitment and perhaps some ecological but limited external validity the results supported previous findings of positive impacts from information provision about recycled water safety fielding and roiko 2014 and also add to the literature on the inter related nature of lower risk perceptions higher trust and higher acceptance fielding et al 2018 the results are encouraging in that they support the use of video animations for engaging the public with water recycling and for reducing perceptions of risk however as the mechanism of communication video animations was not variable there is no evidence to suggest that videos were necessarily any better than other forms of communication e g website pamphlet the results indicate a link between the provision of the video animation messages and trust building the general message which framed the role of recycled water in the context of london s water resource management improved overall trust this improvement in trust is notable as previous studies have qualitatively highlighted a lack of trust in water safety as limiting people s willingness to used non potable recycled water roseth 2008 whilst a number of previous studies have shown an increase in trust in authorities to manage recycled water schemes following the receipt of information price et al 2015 roseth 2008 these results were largely focused on potable reuse the findings of this study extend that trend to a broad palette of non potable reuse possibilities more generally as trust building is considered fundamental for promoting water reuse including in london khan and gerrard 2006 aitken et al 2014 some improvement in trust from viewing the video messages is encouraging there was little indication that the relative risk message impacted on attitude change previous research has found that providing context on the relatively low risk of recycled water for drinking compared to other every day risks can lower risk perceptions and improve public support price et al 2015 in contrast earlier work found that this kind of information may decrease a message s impact fielding and roiko 2014 the findings of this study are more in keeping with the latter similarly the decrease in the general acceptance observed in the group that was not exposed to any messaging is consistent with others that have found decreases in support associated with no information provision fielding and roiko 2014 roseth 2008 it has been argued that public acceptance can wane if engagement efforts are underwhelming russell et al 2008 the results of this study support this claim and also suggest benefits to exploring how information might engage more deeply with the public s understanding of the relative risks of using recycled water also within the context of de facto reuse smith et al 2018 whilst being mindful of methodological limitations the results showed that providing some information was important for maintain positive attitudes towards less contentious uses as well as potentially strengthening support for more contentious uses the value of separating different focal characteristics of water safety messaging was particularly evidenced by the results for the water treatment technology frame which showed some evidence of a negative framing effect compared to the compliance message and the general message whilst previous studies have shown that information about water recycling technology can have positive impacts roseth 2008 dolnicar et al 2010 findings from this study suggest some caution should be taken before pursuing this type of messaging an explanation may be that those already comfortable with water reuse technology or those who are very uncomfortable with it are unlikely to be influenced by more of this type of information de koster and achterberg 2015 results of this study indicate that people may be more receptive to information focusing on the general context or on the management practices that facilitate water quality compliance rather than the ability of water treatment processes to remove contaminants from wastewater the findings presented here provide a platform for exploring attitude change in more detail and further research is recommended to develop and apply the proposed message framing typology and build on evidence of framing effects relating to specific types of non potable recycled water use in different communities there is a particular need to examine effects on attitudes towards more contentious uses where initial attitudes may be more entrenched and difficult to shift as reflected in the results to h3 it is also important to explore the stability of attitudes over longer time periods there are opportunities for developing targeted messages and more so for involving the public to help co construct frames that can help target specific concerns of different groups within the community hallahan 1999 mankad 2012 thus the findings indicate feasible benefits to developing approaches that support more interactive on going frame development processes that aim to negotiate different points of view and expectations dewulf et al 2009 finally whilst this study s findings are encouraging in that they found some impact from messages these were modest impacts there is potential in this form of communication but no single message frame will ever be a panacea for enhancing support of recycled water and practitioners should always be mindful of the need to develop such communications as one part of more comprehensive engagement strategies to achieve more meaningful shifts in public attitudes smith et al 2018 5 conclusions this study aimed to examine the impact of message framing on public attitudes towards non potable water reuse through the use of video messages that selectively communicated information regarding the safety of non potable recycled water use in london the research provides evidence to show that the purposeful selection and emphasis of certain focal characteristics of a message has the potential to influence participants attitudes to recycled water in particular findings illustrate the positive impact of communications which are framed in terms of compliance with water quality requirements on the other hand there was no evident impact from messages framed around the ability of water treatment technologies to remove contaminants nor in terms of non potable water risks relative to other every day risks through the conceptualisation of a message framing typology this study advances understanding of public responses

19298,water reuse is of increasing relevance for water stressed regions but is often considered a contentious option research has shown that providing the public with information about reuse options can impact positively on its acceptability although such impacts can be confined to specific groups in this context there is growing interest in understanding the impact of different forms and mechanisms of communication with the public around reuse this contribution has investigated the use of video animations to communicate the safety of non potable recycled water schemes the aim of this study was to evaluate how different ways of framing messages about the safety of recycled water might impact on public attitudes participants were recruited in london n 689 uk and randomly allocated to test and control groups with the former being exposed to one of four video animations that used different frames to convey messages about recycled water safety surveys collected pre and post video message responses for dependent variables including the general acceptance of diverse non potable recycled water uses risk perceptions and trust the findings complement existing knowledge on the impacts of different types of messaging on public attitudes to reuse schemes with important evidence for the positive impact of water safety communications framed in terms of compliance with water quality requirements contrarily a positive attitudinal impact was not evident for safety message framed in terms of the selection of water treatment technology to remove contaminants nor in terms of non potable water risks relative to other every day risks the results are of value to water resource planners looking to develop communication resources as part of more comprehensive public engagement strategies for improving perceptions of water reuse importantly the findings help isolate the effects of specific message frames and inform the debate on whether an increased understanding of risk positively or negatively influences willingness to support water reuse schemes graphical abstract image 1 keywords non potable water recycled water communication message framing public attitudes 1 introduction the perceived benefits of early public engagement in the planning and design of water reuse schemes frijns et al 2016 hurlimann and dolnicar 2016 lee and tan 2016 are clearly supported by water reuse regulations and guidelines european commission 2016 nrmmc ephc ahmc 2006 usepa 2012 this aspiration for timely public engagement has also been informed by the experiences of both successful harris lovett et al 2015 and unsuccessful hurlimann and dolnicar 2010 reuse schemes involving both potable and non potable recycled water uses the evidence has consistently linked inadequate public engagement with low public support for or increased levels of resistance to reuse projects russell et al 2008 more inclusive dialogue about risks and benefits is often recommended to help understand public attitudes and to build public trust khan and gerrard 2006 the repurposing of wastewater for non potable uses is consistently evaluated by the public to be less contentious than its reuse for drinking water hurlimann and dolnicar 2016 however there are well recognised nuances within this general principle that relate acceptability to the degree of contact with or exposure to the water bruvold 1988 friedler et al 2006 hurlimann et al 2009 for example use of the water for higher exposure uses such as in swimming pools is likely to be less acceptable than for flushing toilets dolnicar and schäfer 2009 explanations for these differences draw from the psychology of contamination and disgust rozin et al 2015 wester et al 2016 and from cultural risk evaluations suggesting preferences for more pure uses marks et al 2008 these differences are well documented but can also vary depending on context as examples there are cases of overwhelming public acceptance for schemes involving potable reuse e g newater singapore mainali et al 2011 and underwhelming acceptance for uses such as toilet flushing buyukkamaci and alkan 2013 health risk fears can lie behind public concerns with specific evidence emerging from cases involving irrigated crops wu et al 2015 and cross contamination in household drinking water supplies hambly et al 2012 there is now a sizeable legacy of research that has engaged with the challenge of understanding the factors underpinning public acceptance bruvold 1988 dolnicar et al 2011 nancarrow et al 2008 ross et al 2014 however contemporary developments have seen increasing interest in understanding how and why public attitudes evolve fielding et al 2018 smith et al 2018 initial negative reactions towards water reuse can be moderated through effective communication leong 2016 2010 russell and lux 2009 and individuals can re evaluate their attitudes when provided with information dolnicar et al 2010 russell et al 2008 wester et al 2016 although there can also be challenges to gauging and interpreting the impact fielding et al 2018 how people react to information about water reuse is thought to depend to a greater extent on the information processing experience dolnicar et al 2010 russell et al 2008 as such there is keen interest in understanding communicative processes in particular how framing e g the careful selection or emphasis of certain pieces of information might influence how people make sense of water management communications dewulf et al 2009 2005 mankad 2012 for water reuse studies have shown positive impacts from providing information that adopts particular terminology menegaki et al 2009 simpson and stratton 2011 includes descriptions of water treatment processes dolnicar et al 2010 or identifies risks and benefits of recycled water price et al 2015 contrastingly research has shown no impact from providing additional information on pollutant levels fielding and roiko 2014 presently there remain limitations to knowledge of how specific communities might respond to different message framing and which modes of communication are more effective fielding and roiko 2014 rozin et al 2015 russell et al 2008 recent years have seen an increase in the deployment of graphical materials dolnicar et al 2010 and animations and videos in particular russell et al 2008 to present information about water reuse the associated benefits of using such media include improvements in accessibility and understanding ishii and boyer 2016 islam et al 2015 tang et al 2015 videos can help viewers grasp more complex resource management concepts krantz and monroe 2016 and the selection of certain images may help develop positive responses towards water augmentation projects dolnicar et al 2014 videos are an increasingly familiar information source and can enhance levels of interest and motivation arvai and louie 2014 such demonstrated benefits have led to the development of video animation resources discussing water management e g sydney water s tap video motion and kearnes 2014 and specifically for water reuse videos describing de facto indirect potable reuse downstream harris lovett et al 2015 direct potable reuse the ways of water watereuse 2014 and sewer mining dessin 2017 despite the growing use of video messaging scientific evaluations of video interventions are sparse arvai and louie 2014 this paper aims to examine the impact of message framing on public attitudes towards non potable water reuse through the use of video messages that selectively communicate information regarding the risk management of non potable recycled water use in london following the principles of framing to select some aspects of a perceived reality and make them more salient to promote a particular idea or problem entman 1993 the content of the different video messages used in this study included different focal characteristics depending on the frame being employed hallahan 1999 levin et al 1998 this paper therefore addresses the following questions 1 to what extent might the initial attitudes of the participants towards non potable recycled water be influenced by messages conveyed through video animations 2 to what extent might message framing variation in the focal characteristics of a message according to the frame being employed influence attitudinal change 3 to what extent might the impact of message framing be associated with initial levels of support for more contentious non potable water uses or demographic variables 4 how might messages about recycled water be improved to help meet the public s expectations with respect to the study location of london uk and how might video animations be used more effectively for engaging the public when developing recycled water schemes 2 methodology 2 1 participant recruitment participants were recruited for pre and post video message surveys from a database of over forty thousand london residents over 18 years of age the survey panel qualtrics worked with databases of participants including harder to reach demographic categories to select participants to take part based on similar studies using online panel based recruitment e g dolnicar et al 2014 the response rate was expected to be in the order of 15 20 however this was not specifically documented participants received a compensation payment at standard rates used by the survey company for the initial survey at time 1 t1 783 surveys were started and 753 completed using a minimum time completion filter to improve data quality set at the 10th percentile completion time 689 valid responses were received for the follow up survey t2 565 responses were started and 6 not completed using the minimum time filter 479 valid responses were received after matching valid responses from t1 and t2 the final sample of matched pairs was n 441 demographic data was collected for gender age ethnicity highest level of education and annual household income demographic characteristics of the valid t1 responses included a mean age of 42 42 sd 16 31 range 18 90 with 354 females 51 4 and 335 males 48 6 for ethnicity 73 1 identified as white british irish or other 9 6 as black or black british 8 1 as asian or british asian 4 6 as mixed ethic background and 4 5 as any other background these demographic proportions accorded well with the general london population over 18 years of age for age mean 43 39 and gender 48 8 male 51 2 female the sample was over representative for those identifying as white ethnicities 60 in london and those with university degrees 38 in london compared with 51 in the sample characteristics of the sample validly completing both stages included a mean age of 47 40 years sd 15 65 range 18 90 with 247 females 56 and 194 males 44 attrition rates varied for different sub groups and for example were higher for males those under 35 and those from mixed and asian or british asian ethnic backgrounds using cross tabulation pearson chi square the proportions for gender χ 2 2 816 df 1 p 0 093 ethnicity χ 2 3 973 df 5 p 0 553 annual income χ 2 0 506 df 5 p 0 992 and level of education χ 2 6 446 df 10 p 0 776 were not significantly different between the two sample points however the change in the distribution of participants between the age categories was statistically significantly χ 2 31 041 df 5 p 0 001 and the implications of this were explored in the analysis the final sample drawn from a database of london residents was of sufficient size to consider the possible representativeness with respect to the general london population aged over 18 of 6 4 million glaintelligence 2016 for claims made about proportions the confidence level was 95 5 error however given the known challenges associated with sampling biases in internet surveys and panel based recruitment van selm and jankowski 2006 potential methodological biases e g acquiescence and social desirability bias along with the biases identified in the demographic proportions of the data any such generalisation were drawn with caveats 2 2 materials survey and video design the independent variables were message frames which determined the selection of information for four different video messages the video messages were created using animation software and embedded in a qualtrics online survey instrument the videos were designed using sparkol s videoscribe software the survey instrument and videos were piloted to address design problems and to check interpretations of words and phrases de vaus 2002 the survey questions and video materials were also pre tested through consultation with a small number of water resource specialists and academics the survey and videos were updated based on these consultations and then piloted with a small sample of the public t1 n 56 t2 n 33 following this refinements were made to the question items and their wording based on cronbach s alpha scores qualitative feedback and comprehension check question results as an example a question about risk benefit trade offs was excluded following the review of cronbach alpha other changes included simplifying the wording of questions and modifying the survey flow and the sequence and timing of the animations in the videos these responses from the piloting were not included in the final analysis 2 2 1 experimental video messages the development and the selection of the frames used in the videos drew from the broader framing literature spanning psychology levin et al 1998 and sociology nisbet 2009 the message framing literature around water management and water reuse goodwin et al 2017 mankad 2012 menegaki et al 2009 rozin et al 2015 wester et al 2016 was then used to develop a conceptual message framing typology table 1 that linked contextual attribute and valance frames with a multi level framing of water resource management water reuse as a management intervention and water safety this typology provided an overarching framework for constructing the messages used in this study a general context framing message was developed which emphasises the water supply challenge for london and the potential role of non potable water reuse as a solution fig 1 the context frames used were informed by literature related to the role of water reuse in london s water supply e g aitken et al 2014 bell and aitken 2008 hills et al 2001 jeffrey and jefferson 2003 smith et al 2014 and the terminology used was informed by the water reuse communication literature specifically macpherson 2014 2011 menegaki et al 2009 motion and kearnes 2014 po et al 2005 simpson and stratton 2011 wrrf 2010 this general context message video duration of 1min 13s employed all three levels of context framing table 1 it described the context for water resource management including the existing water supply regime the influence of climate change and population growth and the potential for a future water supply deficit level 1 context framing it described the context of water reuse as a management intervention including potential benefits level 2 context framing and it described the context of water reuse safety through acknowledging potential risks from contaminants level 3 context framing in addition three alternative water safety attribute frames level 3 attribute framing were developed which added different focal characteristics to the general message 1 water quality compliance wherein the message emphasised that management practices ensure compliance with standards through monitoring sampling testing and reporting to protect human and environmental health from contaminants video duration 1min 37s 2 relative risk wherein the message emphasised that contaminants may be detected in recycled water but that exposure is relative to other every day exposures to similar contaminants such as those in personal care products video duration 1min 33s and 3 technology selection wherein the message emphasised that the selection of water treatment technology including biological treatment carbon filtration membrane filtration chemical oxidation and disinfection targets the removal of specific contaminants to protect human and environmental health video duration 1min 30s these three alternative attribute frames were developed by thematically reviewing water recycling studies focusing on public communications e g fielding and roiko 2014 goodwin et al 2017 harris lovett et al 2015 price et al 2015 roseth 2008 ross et al 2014 rozin et al 2015 wester et al 2016 2 2 2 dependent variables the surveys used likert type questions to quantify five dependent variables these variables were labelled 1 general acceptance 2 support 3 behavioural intentions e g willingness to use the water 4 risk perceptions and 5 trust see table 2 the question items used to measure each dependent variable were built on elicitation methods shown to be consistent and reliable measures aitken et al 2014 fielding and roiko 2014 nancarrow et al 2009 po et al 2005 price et al 2015 ross et al 2014 taking into account contextual specificities and issues identified during piloting a range of non potable water uses were included to span potential levels of exposure to recycled water using general classification methods e g low medium high bruvold 1988 friedler et al 2006 matos et al 2014 however through the aggregation of question items described below the dependent variables sought to summarise the participants general attitudes to non potable recycled water rather than towards specific uses for the water responses to individual question items were recorded using a 6 point scale 1 strongly disagree 2 disagree 3 neither agree nor disagree 4 agree 5 strongly agree and 6 don t know a low proportion of respondents selected don t know 3 and were re coded as neutral ambivalent 3 along with neither agree nor disagree for analysis to improve response validity some questions used reverse wording which were re coded for analysis for each respondent under each dependent variable the numerical scores for individual question items were added together norman 2010 using these aggregate values mean values and standard deviations were calculated for each message group for each dependent variable at each time stage so for the acceptance variable in the no message group at time 1 the mean was calculated through summing scores for all the participants in that group and dividing by the number of participants the internal consistency for all of the variables was evaluated with cronbach alpha to be satisfactory table 2 cronbach s alpha test is commonly referred to in water management e g ishii and boyer 2016 ross et al 2014 and risk research e g poortinga and pidgeon 2003 to measure the inter correlation of question items as an indicator of internal consistency debates on the usefulness and the interpretation of the alpha statistic permeate through the socio psychological literature cortina 1993 however for this study the statistic was considered suitable for the context 2 3 study procedure following consent to participate all participants completed the introductory survey stage with basic demographic questions and initial dependent variable measurements fig 2 participants were then randomly assigned to one of five message groups using inbuilt survey tool functionality to either watch a video animation or not control group with no message immediately following the videos a number of statements were used to gauge 1 how easy the video messages were to understand using the six point likert scale and 2 whether participants recognised the focal characteristics of the message to which they d been assigned the inclusion of comprehension checks followed islam et al 2015 for the latter participants were asks whether the video helped them understand about by selecting all that apply 1 water resource planning 2 water recycling 3 water quality compliance 4 comparing every day risks 5 water treatment technology or 6 anything else allowing for text entry these categorical data were used to help interpret the participants ability to recall and comprehend specificities of the messages by comparing the four message groups using pearson s chi squared test repeat measures were taken at two weeks with this interval selected with reference to related studies dolnicar et al 2010 price et al 2015 and following a similar methodology to roseth 2008 drawing from attitude change theory the approach assumed that 1 attitudes should remain stable in the absence of shock events krosnick and petty 1995 and 2 messages can initiate longer term attitude change if participants are motivated and able to process them dainton 2004 the study procedure acknowledged that attitudes could be affected by other issues coming into public attention after viewing the messages russell et al 2008 but a review of local weather and news media showed that water issues were not salient and were therefore unlikely to influence participants attitudes during the study period attitudes could have been influenced through reflecting on the topic after completing the initial survey roseth 2008 and the no message control group was used to help monitor for such effects 2 4 analysis all data were analysed using ibm spss statistics version 22 0 following the methodology of fielding and roiko 2014 outliers scores greater than 3 standard deviations above or below the mean were identified on the dependent variables and excluded following this the data for the five dependent variables were approximately normally distributed skewness and kurtosis between 2 for all variables moreover levene s test showed homogeneity of variance of the five variables the risk variable has the lower test statistic of p 0 556 therefore parametric statistics were considered appropriate for the analysis given the robustness of anova norman 2010 one way anova on the gain scores changes over time were used to explore whether there were differences between the five groups the hypothesis was that h1 after watching the videos there would be differences in attitudinal changes between each of the four video message groups when compared with the control group paired t tests were used for the matched samples to explore whether the dependent variables changed significantly over time within each of the message groups to explore any framing effect from varying the message content again one way anova was used but to compare only the four video message groups the hypothesis was that h2 there would be a difference between the four message groups n 350 and more specifically between each of the three messages containing specific focal characteristics when compared with the general video message group finally following the methodology of price et al 2015 the initial support for using recycled water in swimming areas was divided to form three groups initially supportive 168 neutral indifferent 85 and initially not supportive 113 the premise of this analysis was to consider whether the message framing might be influential on those initially neutral or not supportive support for use in swimming areas was selected for this analysis on the basis that this was the most contentious use with the highest degree of exposure to recycled water as initial support for uses such as toilet flushing was initially high there was limited scope to consider the change in views of those initially not supportive the hypothesis was that h3 initial levels of support would interact with the video message groups and the impact of the message frames using a univariate general linear model glm two way anova was used to evaluate the interaction between the initial support and the four video message groups for the five dependent variables 2 4 1 demographic weights and variables as attrition in younger age groups was found to be statistically significant between the surveys the influence of age in years was explored as a covariate when comparing the groups using ancova through a univariate glm moreover the possible influence of differences in the demographic composition of the sample was examined through weighting particularly with reference to the londoner population to consider the generalisability of findings weighting was achieved using spss weight cases function to adjust the composition of the sample based on the frequency of demographic data for age gender and ethnicity to be reflective of the proportions in the london population age and gender were explored as independent demographic variables as variations in both have been shown to be associated with differences in attitudes to science castell et al 2014 and differences in responses to message framing levin et al 1998 for example attitudes have been shown to be more impressionable at younger ages typically up to 25 years old krosnick et al 1989 although susceptibility to attitude change may increase again in late adulthood ajzen 2001 the age group categories used for analysis were 18 34 35 44 45 54 55 64 and over 65 two way anovas were conducted using univariate glm to explore interactions between the demographic categories and the message groups no firm hypotheses were made as to the expected nature of the interactions 3 results 3 1 initial general acceptance of non potable water reuse anova showed there was no significant differences in the initial attitudinal responses to the five dependent variables for the participants who went on to be randomly assigned to the five message groups this indicated that at t1 no group displayed any initial attitudinal differences compared with other groups before viewing a video message the dependent variable with the most variance at t1 was support f 1 440 1 272 p 0 280 η 2 0 012 whilst the least variance was for general acceptance f 1 440 0 679 p 0 607 η 2 0 006 the results for initial support and behavioural intentions t1 are summarised in fig 3 to help contextualise the participants responses with respect to the general patterns of agreement with respect to recycled water uses with different degrees of exposure the highest support was for the lowest exposure uses industrial uses 96 agreed and toilet flushing and garden watering 92 agreed the lowest initial support was for the highest exposure use use in recreation swimming areas 46 agreed the results for behavioural intentions followed a similar pattern with higher intentions to use the water for watering gardens and flushing toilets 91 agreed and lower intentions to swim in recycled water 41 agreed in this regard the results were broadly representative of previous research into public attitudes to non potable water reuse in a london context for example see aitken et al 2014 hills et al 2001 smith et al 2014 and therefore ecologically valid 3 2 impact of video messages the results showed that participants were engaged by the video messages and that some aspects of some participants attitudes changed over time depending on the group they were assigned to for the valid sample of matched pairs 441 the changes in attitude scores summated question items for each dependent variable for each participant for the four video message groups were compared with the control group to evaluate the impact of watching the videos firstly pearson s chi square tests showed that there were no statistically significant differences between the distribution of demographic characteristics of the five groups for gender χ 2 2 996 df 4 p 0 559 age χ 2 14 893 df 20 p 0 783 ethnicity χ 2 25 820 df 16 p 0 057 annual income χ 2 21 256 df 20 p 0 382 or level of education χ 2 47 159 df 40 p 0 203 as such no intra group weighting adjustments were made before comparing the five groups comparing the video messages to the control group showed both the compliance message and the general messages had statistically significant improvements for some attitude measurements results from the one way anova table 3 on gain scores showed significant interactions for four of the five dependent variables with small effects sizes η 2 0 02 follow up dunnett s t tests showed statistically significant improvements for the general message group when compared with the control group for the support p 0 026 and trust p 0 042 variables the results showed statistically significant improvements for the compliance group when compared to the control group for acceptance p 0 015 support p 0 031 and risk perceptions p 0 025 due to significant variation in the attrition rate between age groups from t1 to t2 the effect of age as a covariate was evaluated using ancova these results showed no change in the effect sizes for the five dependent variables table 3 3 2 1 message comprehension and impact the results for each message group were explored to see how well the messages were understood by participants in all cases a high proportion of participants 90 agreed with the statement the message was easy to understand with the highest agreement 97 in the general message group the comprehension results showed that participants responded to the water safety attribute frame manipulations comparing the responses from the four groups watching a video showed that the proportion selecting the appropriate statement was highest in the anticipated group the video helped me understand about water quality compliance was significantly higher in the water quality compliance group χ2 21 10 df 3 p 0 001 the video helped me understand about comparing every day risks was significantly higher in the relative risk group χ 2 48 80 df 3 p 0 001 and the video helped me understand about water treatment technology was significantly higher in the technology group χ2 22 06 df 3 p 0 001 the results for each message group were examined individually to determine how the dependent variables changed over time in the no message group there was evidence that the strength of acceptance decreased with paired samples t tests showing a statistically significant decrease in levels of acceptance t 90 2 319 p 0 023 and support t 90 2 068 p 0 041 further inspection of this result showed that these changes were largely due to the participants moving from strongly agree to agree and particularly for the lower exposure uses of toilet flushing and garden watering and industry use in the general message group paired samples t test results showed a significant positive change in trust t 86 2 833 p 0 006 finally in the water quality compliance group paired samples t tests showed a significant positive change in risk perceptions t 79 2 567 p 0 012 3 2 2 london weighting weighting cases so that the proportions were equivalent to the london population for age gender ethnicity level of education resulted in only the risk perception variable showing a significant interaction for the one way anova comparing the five message groups f 4 393 3 550 p 0 007 η 2 0 034 neither acceptance f 4 392 0 636 p 0 637 support f 4 392 0 744 p 0 563 behavioural intentions f 4 392 0 338 p 0 852 or the trust variable f 4 396 0 938 p 0 442 resulted in significant interactions 3 3 comparisons between message groups the results above show that when the groups are examined individually the general message and the compliance message appeared to have the greatest impact on respondents as evidenced by changes in dependent variables trust and risk perceptions however in order to better assess framing effects i e the role of the three message frames as opposed to the general message we also compared the four message groups to each other h2 one way anova showed a significant interaction for the trust variable f 3 345 2 919 p 0 034 η 2 0 025 and there was some indication of an interaction for risk perceptions with a small effects size f 3 342 2 521 p 0 056 η 2 0 022 the interactions were followed up using tukey s post hoc test to explore which groups were different this showed that there was no significant difference between the compliance message group and the general context message group however both the compliance message and the general messages performed better than the technology message which provides some evidence of a negative framing effect from the technology message it was hypothesised h3 that there would be an interaction between the video message groups based on participants initial levels of support for using recycled water for swimming areas particularly as there were high proportions of participants initially not supportive or neutral on this type of use however although there were significant differences between how the attitudes changed in these three initial support categories two way anova did not reveal a significant interaction with the video message groups the interaction was the strongest with the trust variable f 2 353 1 959 p 0 071 η 2 0 032 and weakest for risk perceptions f 2 354 1 263 p 0 274 η 2 0 021 inspection of the marginal means showed that the strongest positive changes were for the participants in the compliance message group n 30 for the acceptance support and risk perception variables for those who were initially not supportive however there was no evidence of a statistically significant framing effect considering the demographic variables of gender and age the only near significant interaction with a medium partial eta squared effect size 0 06 to emerge was for risk perceptions for the two way anova of message group and age category f 12 330 1 761 p 0 054 η 2 0 060 the follow up simple effects test with bonferroni corrections showed statistically significant differences only for the youngest age group category 18 34 where participants perceived less risk in the compliance message group compared with the technology message group mean difference 2 635 p 0 025 all other differences between the groups were less and not statistically significant for all other age categories whilst these differences were observed it is noted that there were small numbers of participants within the age group categories of each video message group based on these analyses the following summation of message impacts and framing effects is put forward table 4 the overall picture that emerged was that the general context message and the water quality compliance message had more impact on participants in contrast with the general context message and to some degree the compliance message the water treatment technology focal characteristic may have reduced the potential for the messages to have a positive impact on the participants attitudes 3 3 1 london weighting weighting cases so that the proportions were equivalent to the london population for age gender ethnicity level of education resulted in only the risk perception variable showing a significant interaction for the one way anova comparing the four video groups f 3 309 4 680 p 0 003 η 2 0 043 neither acceptance f 3 296 0 654 p 0 581 support f 3 297 0 591 p 0 621 behavioural intentions f 3 300 0 447 p 0 720 or the trust variable f 3 300 1 239 p 0 296 resulted in significant interactions on inspection of the tukey post hoc test results for the risk perception interaction both the general message p 0 020 and the compliance message p 0 018 had statistically significant improvement when compared to the technology message the interactions with age and gender categories were also explored using two way anova as with the unweighted sample there was a significant interaction between age categories and message group for risk perceptions f 12 349 2 355 p 0 006 η 2 0 075 and through inspection of the marginal means and simple effects tests a similar pattern of results emerged as with the unweighted sample 4 discussion in this study we investigated the impact of video messages and message framing on participants attitudes to non potable recycled water findings demonstrate that participants were engaged by the video messages and that some aspects of some participants attitudes did change over time depending on the group they were assigned to comparing the video messages to the control no message group showed that both the general context message and the water quality compliance messages resulted in improvements for some attitude measurements the impact was more pronounced in terms of decreasing perceptions of risk and increasing trust in management however results from the comparisons between groups showed that for the compliance message it is difficult to ascertain whether the added compliance frame had any impact over and above that of the general message following weighting of the sample to match demographic proportions in the london population the results pointed to implications for improving risk perceptions in the younger age groups with the difference in results also highlighting limitations to the method of participant recruitment and perhaps some ecological but limited external validity the results supported previous findings of positive impacts from information provision about recycled water safety fielding and roiko 2014 and also add to the literature on the inter related nature of lower risk perceptions higher trust and higher acceptance fielding et al 2018 the results are encouraging in that they support the use of video animations for engaging the public with water recycling and for reducing perceptions of risk however as the mechanism of communication video animations was not variable there is no evidence to suggest that videos were necessarily any better than other forms of communication e g website pamphlet the results indicate a link between the provision of the video animation messages and trust building the general message which framed the role of recycled water in the context of london s water resource management improved overall trust this improvement in trust is notable as previous studies have qualitatively highlighted a lack of trust in water safety as limiting people s willingness to used non potable recycled water roseth 2008 whilst a number of previous studies have shown an increase in trust in authorities to manage recycled water schemes following the receipt of information price et al 2015 roseth 2008 these results were largely focused on potable reuse the findings of this study extend that trend to a broad palette of non potable reuse possibilities more generally as trust building is considered fundamental for promoting water reuse including in london khan and gerrard 2006 aitken et al 2014 some improvement in trust from viewing the video messages is encouraging there was little indication that the relative risk message impacted on attitude change previous research has found that providing context on the relatively low risk of recycled water for drinking compared to other every day risks can lower risk perceptions and improve public support price et al 2015 in contrast earlier work found that this kind of information may decrease a message s impact fielding and roiko 2014 the findings of this study are more in keeping with the latter similarly the decrease in the general acceptance observed in the group that was not exposed to any messaging is consistent with others that have found decreases in support associated with no information provision fielding and roiko 2014 roseth 2008 it has been argued that public acceptance can wane if engagement efforts are underwhelming russell et al 2008 the results of this study support this claim and also suggest benefits to exploring how information might engage more deeply with the public s understanding of the relative risks of using recycled water also within the context of de facto reuse smith et al 2018 whilst being mindful of methodological limitations the results showed that providing some information was important for maintain positive attitudes towards less contentious uses as well as potentially strengthening support for more contentious uses the value of separating different focal characteristics of water safety messaging was particularly evidenced by the results for the water treatment technology frame which showed some evidence of a negative framing effect compared to the compliance message and the general message whilst previous studies have shown that information about water recycling technology can have positive impacts roseth 2008 dolnicar et al 2010 findings from this study suggest some caution should be taken before pursuing this type of messaging an explanation may be that those already comfortable with water reuse technology or those who are very uncomfortable with it are unlikely to be influenced by more of this type of information de koster and achterberg 2015 results of this study indicate that people may be more receptive to information focusing on the general context or on the management practices that facilitate water quality compliance rather than the ability of water treatment processes to remove contaminants from wastewater the findings presented here provide a platform for exploring attitude change in more detail and further research is recommended to develop and apply the proposed message framing typology and build on evidence of framing effects relating to specific types of non potable recycled water use in different communities there is a particular need to examine effects on attitudes towards more contentious uses where initial attitudes may be more entrenched and difficult to shift as reflected in the results to h3 it is also important to explore the stability of attitudes over longer time periods there are opportunities for developing targeted messages and more so for involving the public to help co construct frames that can help target specific concerns of different groups within the community hallahan 1999 mankad 2012 thus the findings indicate feasible benefits to developing approaches that support more interactive on going frame development processes that aim to negotiate different points of view and expectations dewulf et al 2009 finally whilst this study s findings are encouraging in that they found some impact from messages these were modest impacts there is potential in this form of communication but no single message frame will ever be a panacea for enhancing support of recycled water and practitioners should always be mindful of the need to develop such communications as one part of more comprehensive engagement strategies to achieve more meaningful shifts in public attitudes smith et al 2018 5 conclusions this study aimed to examine the impact of message framing on public attitudes towards non potable water reuse through the use of video messages that selectively communicated information regarding the safety of non potable recycled water use in london the research provides evidence to show that the purposeful selection and emphasis of certain focal characteristics of a message has the potential to influence participants attitudes to recycled water in particular findings illustrate the positive impact of communications which are framed in terms of compliance with water quality requirements on the other hand there was no evident impact from messages framed around the ability of water treatment technologies to remove contaminants nor in terms of non potable water risks relative to other every day risks through the conceptualisation of a message framing typology this study advances understanding of public responses to information and provides an avenue for improving communication around reuse schemes the corroboration of benefits to communicating about recycled water safety within the water resource context is of considerable benefit to water industry practitioners developing public engagement information acknowledgements this research was co funded by the uk s engineering and physical science research

19299,abiotic mechanisms of oxytetracycline degradation by redox active minerals fe iii saturated montmorillonite fe swy and birnessite δ mno2 were studied to better understand the environmental behavior of tetracycline antibiotics in aqueous systems kinetics of dissipation adsorption oxidation and formation of transformation products tps was investigated up to 7 days and reaction mechanisms were elucidated based on identification of tps by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry oxytetracycline was completely removed from solution by both minerals however kinetics tps and mechanisms were distinct for each mineral oxytetracycline oxidation by δ mno2 occurred within minutes 54 identified tps were detected only in solution most of them exhibited decreasing levels with time in contrast oxytetracycline was completely adsorbed by fe swy its degradation was slower only 29 tps were identified among them 13 were surface bound and most of the tps accumulated in the system with time oxytetracycline transformation by δ mno2 involved radicals as was proven by electrochemical degradation reductive dissolution was observed for both minerals x ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrated accumulation of fe ii on fe swy surface whereas mn ii was primarily released from δ mno2 surface highly oxidized carbon species i e newly formed tps were observed on the surface of both minerals interacting with oxytetracycline this study demonstrates the impact of structure and reactivity of redox active minerals on removal and decomposition of tetracycline antibiotics in aqueous systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords electrospray adsorption removal radical tetracycline antibiotic 1 introduction oxytetracycline a broad spectrum antibacterial agent is being used extensively for veterinary purposes as well as for treatment of infections in humans kemper 2008 after oral or intravenous intake up to 75 of the parent molecule is excreted from the body winckler and grafe 2001 thus the parent compound and its metabolites are introduced to the environment via manure or sludge application and irrigation with untreated or treated wastewater or runoff daghrir and drogui 2013 oxytetracycline has been detected in wastewater treated wastewater and surface water at μg l concentration range kolpin et al 2002 and in soils at μg kg concentrations aga et al 2005 oxytetracycline metabolites were also found in manure various animal tissues aqueous systems and manure fertilized soil aga et al 2005 fletouris and papapanagiotou 2009 hamscher et al 2002 jia et al 2009 kolpin et al 2002 wang et al 2017 some of the detected metabolites exhibit bacterial toxicity halling sørensen et al 2002 due to intensive use and the constant release to the environment oxytetracycline was reported to promote microbial resistance by induction of resistant genes in bacteria schmitt et al 2006 seyfried et al 2010 environmental fate of oxytetracycline and its metabolites is affected by various processes including adsorption to solid phases complexation with metals oxidation and hydrolysis oxytetracycline hydrolysis in water follows first order kinetics resulting in formation of transformation products tps such as 4 epi oxytetracycline and α apo oxytetracycline xuan et al 2010 half life time of oxytetracycline in aquatic systems ranges from 0 26 to 9 days depending on solution chemistry doi and stoskopf 2000 oxytetracycline and epi oxytetracycline complexation with dissolved fe ii mn ii and cu ii in the presence of oxygen results in degradation of both oxytetracycline species followed by formation of radical products chen and huang 2009 wang et al 2015b in soils oxytetracycline is mainly degraded by biological processes under aerobic non sterile conditions with half life time ranging between 29 and 62 days yang et al 2009 oxytetracycline is efficiently adsorbed by iron oxides via ligand exchange carrasquillo et al 2008 figueroa and mackay 2005 the presence of low concentration of humic acid 1 mg l 1 was reported to increase oxytetracycline adsorption on na montmorillonite but higher concentration of humic acid 10 mg l 1 resulted in the opposite effect kulshrestha et al 2004 oxytetracycline participates in redox reactions with mineral surfaces due to the presence of several nitrogen and oxygen containing groups in the molecule fig 1 redox active minerals in soils i e minerals containing fe iii and mn iv play an important role in transformation of polar organic pollutants pignatello et al 2006 remucal and ginder vogel 2014 zhang and huang 2005a 2005b and can be used for degradation of pollutants in wastewater treatment technologies liu et al 2016 birnessite was found to efficiently oxidize a wide range of organic compounds and reactions were typically accompanied by reductive dissolution of the mineral remucal and ginder vogel 2014 birnessite was reported to enhance the oxidative removal of oxytetracycline from solution with half life time of approximately 0 25 min rubert and pedersen 2006 chen and huang 2011 proposed a second order reaction rate involving surface complexation of oxytetracycline by birnessite followed by oxytetracycline mn electron transfer they detected 4 tps in solution formed during degradation of oxytetracycline and suggested oxytetracycline birnessite interactions involved radical formation as the major pathway of oxytetracycline degradation chen and huang 2011 mechanisms of oxytetracycline removal by mineral surfaces from water were previously reported however oxidation processes were studied for short term reactions 45 h daghrir and drogui 2013 though oxidation of a compound by mineral surfaces can take longer than its removal from solution chen and huang 2010 moreover although oxytetracycline is considered not persistent in natural aqueous systems only few tps formed during these short term reactions were observed in solutions chen and huang 2011 remucal and ginder vogel 2014 rubert and pedersen 2006 however to understand the behavior and transformation of organic pollutants in environmental systems the presence of pollutant tps should be tested in both liquid and solid phases surface bound tps the objective of this study was to elucidate the mechanisms of oxytetracycline adsorption and abiotic oxidative transformation by two minerals fe iii saturated montmorillonite fe swy and birnessite δ mno2 during longer periods of oxytetracycline mineral interactions up to 7 days detailed mechanisms of the adsorption and transformation of oxytetracycline were constructed which considered both dissolved and surface bound tps montmorillonite was chosen as a common clay mineral in semiarid soils singer 2007 which is characterized by high surface area ratner zohar et al 1983 iron oxides which are intimately bound to soil minerals johnston and tombacz 2002 kubicki et al 1999 are important redox active components of soil particle surfaces hence we used fe swy as redox active mineral surface with large surface area the experiments performed with this type of sorbent allowed observing adsorption and transformation processes of oxytetracycline which might occur in environmental systems another redox active mineral is naturally abundant birnessite δ mno2 remucal and ginder vogel 2014 chosen minerals are characterized by different reduction potentials structure and surface area and thus are expected to demonstrate distinct reactivity towards oxytetracycline oxidation in this study we tested the following hypotheses i oxidation of oxytetracycline during one week will be more intense by δ mno2 than by fe swy due to higher reduction potential of mn iv as compared to fe iii ii kinetics and mechanisms of adsorption and transformation as well as tps will differ for each mineral due to different oxidation efficiency of fe iii and mn iv containing minerals iii radicals are involved in transformation of oxytetracycline by both minerals examined to test these hypotheses study of adsorptive transformation mechanism of oxytetracycline by fe swy and δ mno2 was performed 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals

was repeated until the supernatant was colorless then the slurry was oven dried overnight at 35 c both minerals were freeze dried after preparation 2 3 oxytetracycline removal and transformation

casa software ltd the curve fitting was performed using gaussian lorenzian 30 ratio the binding energies were calibrated using c 1s peak as 285 0 ev baseline was subtracted from each spectra and all intensities were normalized to the highest intensity in the spectrum hawn and dekoven 1987 morant et al 1989 based on xps measurements surface metal reduction ratio was calculated as the ratio between area of reduced metal to area of oxidized metal for the high energy peak 2p 3 2 2 7 electrochemistry experiments electrochemistry experiments were carried out with oxytetracycline solution to simulate radical mechanism of oxytetracycline decomposition on mineral surfaces and to compare tps that are formed in electrochemistry experiments to the tps produced due to oxytetracycline oxidation by mineral seiwert et al 2016 electrochemistry conversion was performed with a flow rate of 10 μl min 1 in a system consisting of a reactorcell equipped with a boron doped diamond or glassy carbon working electrode and a roxy potentiostat which was controlled by dialoge software antec the netherlands the oxytetracycline solution contained 20 mm of ammonium acetate buffer at ph 4 0 and 6 4 to simulate ph of oxytetracycline fe swy and oxytetracycline δ mno2 suspensions respectively and 25 of meoh aliquots of solutions used in these experiments were analyzed within several hours after collection by lc hrms 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal of oxytetracycline by mineral surfaces changes in mineral structure and solution composition removal of oxytetracycline by minerals and the accompanying reductive dissolution of mineral surfaces were different for the two oxytetracycline mineral systems though in both systems oxytetracycline was present as zwitterion ph of oxytetracycline fe swy and oxytetracycline δ mno2 system was 4 and 7 respectively tavares and mcguffin 1994 with the dimethylamino group of oxytetracycline fig 1 interacting with the negatively charged mineral surfaces carrasquillo et al 2008 chen and huang 2010 figueroa and mackay 2005 wang et al 2015b the ph in each oxytetracycline mineral system was constant during all experiments oxytetracycline was completely removed from solution by fe swy during the first hour recovered fraction of surface bound oxytetracycline from fe swy decreased with time figure s1 a about 26 of oxytetracycline was recovered from fe swy surface even after a week to elucidate the role of mineral structure in oxytetracycline adsorption and to test its interlayer sorption kulshrestha et al 2004 wu et al 2013 changes in basal spacing were measured during adsorption experiment basal spacing of fe swy in the absence of oxytetracycline was 13 å figure s2 a while during oxytetracycline adsorption the basal spacing increased to 14 7 å for oxytetracycline at an initial concentration of 54 μm and to 18 4 å for 540 μm the basal spacing reached its maximal expansion in 6 h basal spacing widening can occur due to steric re arrangement of oxytetracycline molecules following adsorption in the interlayer spaces or due to penetration of tps into the interlayer spacing or owing to both processes oxytetracycline adsorption was accompanied by the dissolution of iron which was noticeable as the concentration of total dissolved iron increased with time figure s1 b the total iron concentration might include both fe ii and fe iii species since no dissolved fe was observed in control samples it can be suggested that three types of iron species are released into solution fe ii or fe iii complexed with organic molecules oxytetracycline or tps or free fe ii ion formation of fe ii in solution during incubation of oxytetracycline with fe swy was confirmed by ferrozine test data not shown formation of soluble complexes of fe ii with organic molecules might prevent fe ii from oxidation theis and singer 1974 oxytetracycline was neither detected in solution after 1 h of incubation with δ mno2 nor was recovered from δ mno2 surface during one week experiment figure s1 a these results are in accordance with data of rubert and pedersen 2006 who showed that 70 of oxytetracycline at initial concentration of 25 μm was removed from solution within the first few minutes of reaction due to its oxidation by mno2 surface no changes in the basal spacing of untreated δ mno2 7 3 å and oxytetracycline treated δ mno2 were observed during the reaction time figure s2 b hence oxytetracycline δ mno2 interactions occurred only on the external surface of oxide no mn ii was observed in solution of control system δ mno2 suspended in double deionized water whereas significant concentrations of mn ii was detected in solution of oxytetracycline treated δ mno2 as reaction progressed figure s1 b higher concentration of dissolved mn as compared to fe can be explained by the following reasons i greater reduction potential of mn iv than that of fe iii and ii fe swy has a layered structure thus containing fe iii on its external and internal surfaces hence ferrous iron formed due to fe iii reduction by oxytetracycline can remain immobilized in the interlayer surfaces preventing its dissolution by contrast oxytetracycline reaction with mn ii occurs on the external surface only thus mn ii though might be adsorbed to the oxide surface rennert et al 2005 is released into solution release of mn ii from the surface produces new active sites on mineral surfaces thus providing higher oxidation capacity of δ mno2 towards oxytetracycline 3 2 adsorptive oxidation of oxytetracycline by mineral surfaces impact on surface atomic composition though both fe iii and mn iv on minerals surfaces were reduced our results clearly demonstrated difference in behavior of metals in oxytetracycline mineral systems 3 2 1 iron and manganese xps spectra of iron of oxytetracycline treated fe swy showed an increase in peak area of fe ii with time hence incubation of oxytetracycline with fe swy resulted in fe ii accumulation on the surface with time fig 2 a c control samples contained only fe iii on the mineral surface fe ii peak was not detected in their spectra fig s3 a b table s1 b shows that the amount of total fe on fe swy surface was within the narrow range of 1 49 1 73 indicating that most of the iron stayed on the mineral surfaces apparently because it remained in the interlayer space however as reaction proceeds the fe ii content increased from 0 to 33 with a corresponding decrease in fe iii as a result the surface reduction ratio of fe swy table s1b which characterizes the relative amount of reduced to oxidized metal on mineral surface increased with time until fe ii became more dominant than fe iii mn ii peak decreased until it disappeared with increasing incubation time fig 2 d f and percent of reduced mn ii species from the total mn on the surface dropped with time from 4 to 0 simultaneously the peak area of mn iv increased from 55 to 85 from the total mn table s1 b reduction of δ mno2 surface was accompanied by mn ii accumulation in solution figure s2 b mn ii was present on the surface of control samples after 1 h of incubation figure s3 c this can be explained by a process occurring during δ mno2 synthesis described in text s1 however after 96 h of incubation mn ii disappeared from the mineral surface in control samples due to dissolution figure s3 d significant changes in δ mno2 surface composition disagree with previous findings by jiang et al who studied oxytetracycline interactions with natural birnessite and reported only negligible changes in surface mn iv jiang et al 2014 it appears that intensity of surface redox properties of manganese oxides depend on their structure this issue needs further investigation the decrease in mn ii concentration on the surface and its increase in solution implies that the redox process is mainly responsible for the removal of oxytetracycline from solution 3 2 2 carbon carbohydrates are present on each mineral surface and thus the peak at 285 ev attributed to c h c c groups is used as a reference in xps measurements yamashita and hayes 2008 for both mineral control samples no significant changes were observed in c spectra in the absence of oxytetracycline i e peak areas did not change with the incubation time except for disappearance of the carbonyl peak 289 ev fig s4 which can be explained by dissolution of polar species carbon atomic concentration on the mineral surfaces nearly doubles with oxytetracycline addition table s1 a spectra of oxytetracycline treated samples showed an increase in the peak area of the more oxidized forms of carbon 287 ev and the formation of carboxylic group with time 290 291 ev which demonstrated that oxytetracycline oxidation on the mineral surfaces enhanced as reaction progressed fig 3 a c and fig s5 for both minerals c o fraction 287 and 289 ev peaks constantly increased whereas fraction of c h decreased due to faster reaction kinetics of δ mno2 as compared to fe swy carboxylic group 290 291 ev was noticed for δ mno2 after 24 h whereas for fe swy it was observed after 96 h unlike oxytetracycline fe swy system fig s5 oxygen bound carbon 287 ev in oxytetracycline δ mno2 system became the dominant species on the surface fig 3 different kinetics and intensity of oxytetracycline oxidative transformation by fe swy and δ mno2 demonstrates the distinct behavior of minerals towards oxytetracycline δ mno2 is acting as a faster and stronger oxidizer than fe swy due to higher reduction potential of mn iv and owing to exposure of newly formed sites on the δ mno2 surface as reductive dissolution of the mineral progresses 3 2 3 oxygen in the absence of oxytetracycline no changes in oxygen spectra and peak areas were observed fig s6 thus both minerals exhibited no change in surface oxygen species during incubation oxygen spectra of oxytetracycline treated δ mno2 showed a decrease in o mn peaks 530 ev which agrees with reductive dissolution of δ mno2 and an increase in carbon bound oxygen 532 and 534 ev fig 3 d f similar behavior of surface c and o was observed for other organic contaminants oxidized by manganese oxide surface shaikh et al 2016 oxygen spectra of oxytetracycline treated fe swy indicate minor fe oxide formation with time fig s7 which might occur due to oxidation of fe ii by atmospheric oxygen spectra of surface oxygen for oxytetracycline treated fe swy show less significant changes as compared with δ mno2 spectra due to lower oxidizing intensity of fe swy and dominance of silicone bound oxygen in this system 3 3 mechanisms of oxytetracycline oxidative transformation by fe swy and δ mno2 two major processes oxidation and hydrolysis control the abiotic transformation of oxytetracycline in the aqueous fe swy and δ mno2 systems tps which are formed in the processes of oxytetracycline transformation can accumulate or continue transforming on the mineral surface or in solution in this work we suggested the processes and pathways of abiotic oxytetracycline transformation in the aqueous oxytetracycline fe swy and oxytetracycline δ mno2 systems at ph 4 and 7 respectively based on the tps chemical formulas which we constructed using lc hrms data obtained during 7 days of oxytetracycline and tps interaction with minerals oxytetracycline alone in the absence of minerals can undergo hydrolysis in solution however the products of oxytetracycline hydrolysis may also interact with the mineral surfaces formation of some hydrolysis products were enhanced in the presence of mineral surfaces and others were found at higher concentrations in the absence of minerals i e in control samples containing oxytetracycline only in table s2 the former is denoted as enhanced in the presence of mineral and the latter as diminished in the presence of mineral decrease in the concentration of hydrolysis products in the presence of minerals can be explained by their further transformation or their adsorption on the mineral surfaces based on all collected data we proposed mechanisms of oxytetracycline transformation by each mineral fig 4 a and b a list of all tps observed in both systems is shown in table s2 we suppose that not all tps which were formed in oxytetracycline mineral systems were detected because high polarity of tps and low m z ratio 50 m z might impede their detection by the instrument thus dashed arrows in fig 4 symbolize further decomposition of tps to undetected tps structural isomers were considered as the same tps in the mechanism but were differentiated in the tps list table s2 kinetic behavior of tps which were degraded or accumulated in solution during 7 days of the experiment was characterized by plotting the integrated peak areas versus time table s2 kinetics of the surface bound tps behavior was not characterized because extraction process was conducted only after a week incubation of oxytetracycline with minerals twenty nine tps were found in oxytetracycline fe swy system 13 of them were surface bound 23 were found in solution few tps were found in both phases molecular weight of some tps was significantly smaller than that of oxytetracycline indicating breakdown of the molecular structure during oxidation fig 4 a i tp481 underwent ring opening accompanied by loss of its dimethyl amino group and decarbonylation c2h7n co which resulted in tp408 formation another pathway of tp481 decomposition producing tp364 involved loss of the tricarbonylamide group and 4 hydrogens c4h3no3 4h ii tp209 fe denoted so because it was detected in oxytetracycline fe swy system to distinguish from tp209 mn and tp211 were formed due to breakage of tp423 4h iii tp423 also broke into tp196 and tp217 after loss of ch2no decarbonylation and hydration ch2no co h2o tp217 recombined with another tp217 molecule followed by oxidation o to produce tp425 tp449 was generated in a two step process oxytetracycline h2o co2 2h o and tp431 tp449 h2o were previously observed in solution for oxytetracycline oxidative transformation by carbonate radical liu et al 2016 oxytetracycline oxidative transformation in the δ mno2 system differed from the fe swy in terms of kinetics and chemical formulas of formed tps since oxidation kinetics in this system was much faster samples were collected and analyzed in short time intervals during the first hour of reaction as well as in long time intervals of up to a week presence of oxygen did not affect the mechanism in the first minutes and thus it was concluded that the mechanism of oxidation is not initiated by reactive oxygen species originating from molecular oxygen oxytetracycline was not found in the system shortly after the reaction started totally 54 tps were detected 50 of these tps could be incorporated into one scheme of transformation table s2 fig 3 b in contrast to the oxytetracycline fe swy system all tps produced in oxytetracycline δ mno2 system were detected only in solution none was surface bound breakage of tp molecules was observed in the following cases i tp477 broke to tp285 and tp213 and ii tp426 broke to tp163 and tp209 mn denoted so because it was detected in oxytetracycline δ mno2 system to distinguish from tp209 fe after loss of amine and oxygen o nh3 a recombination reaction is proposed to form tp640 by addition of tp180 to an oxytetracycline molecule such reaction is not expected to occur at low environmental concentrations of oxytetracycline loss of dimethyl amino group was observed twice in this reaction system at the formation of tp170 tp213 c2h5n and tp426 tp447 c2h5n formation of tp447 and tp477 resulting from oxytetracycline demethylation and hydroxylation respectively was previously reported by chen and huang for oxytetracycline oxidation by δ mno2 chen and huang 2011 they suggested that tp447 was formed due to n demethylation of oxytetracycline i e loss of ch3 at n ch3 2 group tp640 that was found in the studied oxytetracycline δ mno2 system was similar to tp639 detected by chen and huang 2011 liu et al 2015 2016 demonstrated participation of hydroxyl and carbonate radicals in oxytetracycline degradation in uv h2o2 systems liu et al 2015 2016 eight tps which were detected in their work were also identified in the studied oxytetracycline δ mno2 system this suggests involvement of radicals in oxytetracycline degradation by δ mno2 besides oxytetracycline degradation in different redox systems was previously shown to be radical wang et al 2015b 2015a zhao et al 2013 to test the role of hydroxyl radicals in oxytetracycline oxidation by δ mno2 the hydroxyl radical scavenger tert butanol piechowski et al 1992 was added to the oxytetracycline δ mno2 system at different concentrations the presence of tert butanol suppressed oxytetracycline degradation higher concentrations of oxytetracycline remained in the system with increasing concentration of added tert butanol data not shown this confirms the participation of radicals in oxytetracycline degradation by δ mno2 to better understand the role of radicals in oxytetracycline degradation and tps formation electrochemical experiments were performed with oxytetracycline solution the reactions simulated by electrochemistry are oxidation by addition of oxygen quinonization demethylation deamination and dehydration jurva et al 2003 in this system voltage is applied 0 5 2 0 v to the electrode seiwert et al 2016 and oxytetracycline degradation occurred due to a surface reaction by direct contact of oxytetracycline with the electrode followed by oxidation and organic radical formation in case of glassy carbon electrode simonet 2013 or due to formation of hydroxyl radicals in solution i e indirect reaction in case of boron doped diamond electrode marselli et al 2003 seiwert et al 2015 as the spectrum of tps generated with the boron doped diamond and the glassy carbon electrode was identical it appears that oxidation on the electrode surface and in solution both contributed to oxytetracycline transformation and both types of radicals hydroxyl and organic might be involved in the process of oxytetracycline oxidation similarity of tps detected in electrochemistry and in oxytetracycline δ mno2 systems are shown in table s3 eight of the tps formed by electrochemical oxidation are identical to those detected in the δ mno2 system similar tps formed during the first minutes of oxytetracycline δ mno2 interaction i e at the initial steps of the process advanced and more complex oxidation reactions could probably not be simulated because of the short contact time of oxytetracycline with the electrode by comparison no similarity was found between tps formed electrochemically and in oxytetracycline fe swy system based on the similarity of tps obtained in electrochemistry and oxytetracycline δ mno2 systems we suggest two pathways of oxytetracycline oxidation by δ mno2 involving participation of radicals i oxytetracycline δ mno2 interactions induce formation of hydroxyl radicals which degrade oxytetracycline and tps ii oxytetracycline molecules are directly oxidized by δ mno2 to form organic radicals which are transformed on the mineral surface reacting with other tps on the surface or in solution 3 4 comparison of redox transformations in oxytetracycline fe swy and oxytetracycline δ mno2 systems major features overall the examined minerals varied in kinetics of oxytetracycline transformations number and structures of tps and mechanisms of oxytetracycline mineral interactions oxytetracycline interactions with the examined minerals resulted in different products except for two tps tp431 and tp189 that were detected in both systems but exhibited different behavior in time table s2 oxytetracycline degradation by fe swy was less efficient than by δ mno2 oxytetracycline transformation by δ mno2 involved two oxidations reactions producing tp477 and tp447 which lead to the formation of more than 90 of tps in the system fast kinetics of oxytetracycline oxidation in δ mno2 system complicates the understanding of the role of mineral surface in oxytetracycline transformation it is unclear whether further degradation of tps occurs due to encounter with the surface or in solution in contrast relatively slow kinetics of oxytetracycline fe swy interactions allowed easy monitoring the reactions in the system and thus facilitated the comprehension of the mineral surface role in oxytetracycline oxidation 4 conclusions oxytetracycline degradation by fe and mn containing surfaces results in the formation of numerous tps and their environmental fate is still unknown both fe and mn containing surfaces remove oxytetracycline from solution and induce its degradation thus impeding antibiotic impact on microorganisms δ mno2 behaves as a fast and efficient oxidizer whereas fe swy acts as an effective sorbent with oxytetracycline oxidative degradation gradually developing with time fast removal and advanced degradation of oxytetracycline by δ mno2 were accompanied by the release of multiple tps into solution on the contrary the high sorption capacity of fe swy can prevent oxytetracycline from being released back to solution oxytetracycline was not found in the presence of δ mno2 after a few minutes of incubation whereas only partial removal of the parent compound by fe swy during a week poses a potential risk of its activity in the environment the results of this study undercut the assumption of oxytetracycline s low stability in environment since radicals are involved in degradation of oxytetracycline by δ mno2 natural radical scavengers i e dissolved organic matter are likely to influence the pathways and mechanism of oxytetracycline transformation in the environment in this study we found that epi oxytetracycline α apo oxytetracycline and β apo oxytetracycline which are commonly used as model tps to monitor oxytetracycline degradation in various experimental systems are only short lived minutes intermediates in the process of the oxytetracycline transformation by δ mno2 hence their application in the experimental studies related to the environmental fate of oxytetracycline is questionable a combination of the two redox active minerals which varied in adsorption and oxidative efficiencies might be useful for removal of organic pollutants and their tps from water appendix a supplementary data the following is the supplementary data related to this article

19299,abiotic mechanisms of oxytetracycline degradation by redox active minerals fe iii saturated montmorillonite fe swy and birnessite δ mno2 were studied to better understand the environmental behavior of tetracycline antibiotics in aqueous systems kinetics of dissipation adsorption oxidation and formation of transformation products tps was investigated up to 7 days and reaction mechanisms were elucidated based on identification of tps by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry oxytetracycline was completely removed from solution by both minerals however kinetics tps and mechanisms were distinct for each mineral oxytetracycline oxidation by δ mno2 occurred within minutes 54 identified tps were detected only in solution most of them exhibited decreasing levels with time in contrast oxytetracycline was completely adsorbed by fe swy its degradation was slower only 29 tps were identified among them 13 were surface bound and most of the tps accumulated in the system with time oxytetracycline transformation by δ mno2 involved radicals as was proven by electrochemical degradation reductive dissolution was observed for both minerals x ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrated accumulation of fe ii on fe swy surface whereas mn ii was primarily released from δ mno2 surface highly oxidized carbon species i e newly formed tps were observed on the surface of both minerals interacting with oxytetracycline this study demonstrates the impact of structure and reactivity of redox active minerals on removal and decomposition of tetracycline antibiotics in aqueous systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords electrospray adsorption removal radical tetracycline antibiotic 1 introduction oxytetracycline a broad spectrum antibacterial agent is being used extensively for veterinary purposes as well as for treatment of infections in humans kemper 2008 after oral or intravenous intake up to 75 of the parent molecule is excreted from the body winckler and grafe 2001 thus the parent compound and its metabolites are introduced to the environment via manure or sludge application and irrigation with untreated or treated wastewater or runoff daghrir and drogui 2013 oxytetracycline has been detected in wastewater treated wastewater and surface water at μg l concentration range kolpin et al 2002 and in soils at μg kg concentrations aga et al 2005 oxytetracycline metabolites were also found in manure various animal tissues aqueous systems and manure fertilized soil aga et al 2005 fletouris and papapanagiotou 2009 hamscher et al 2002 jia et al 2009 kolpin et al 2002 wang et al 2017 some of the detected metabolites exhibit bacterial toxicity halling sørensen et al 2002 due to intensive use and the constant release to the environment oxytetracycline was reported to promote microbial resistance by induction of resistant genes in bacteria schmitt et al 2006 seyfried et al 2010 environmental fate of oxytetracycline and its metabolites is affected by various processes including adsorption to solid phases complexation with metals oxidation and hydrolysis oxytetracycline hydrolysis in water follows first order kinetics resulting in formation of transformation products tps such as 4 epi oxytetracycline and α apo oxytetracycline xuan et al 2010 half life time of oxytetracycline in aquatic systems ranges from 0 26 to 9 days depending on solution chemistry doi and stoskopf 2000 oxytetracycline and epi oxytetracycline complexation with dissolved fe ii mn ii and cu ii in the presence of oxygen results in degradation of both oxytetracycline species followed by formation of radical products chen and huang 2009 wang et al 2015b in soils oxytetracycline is mainly degraded by biological processes under aerobic non sterile conditions with half life time ranging between 29 and 62 days yang et al 2009 oxytetracycline is efficiently adsorbed by iron oxides via ligand exchange carrasquillo et al 2008 figueroa and mackay 2005 the presence of low concentration of humic acid 1 mg l 1 was reported to increase oxytetracycline adsorption on na montmorillonite but higher concentration of humic acid 10 mg l 1 resulted in the opposite effect kulshrestha et al 2004 oxytetracycline participates in redox reactions with mineral surfaces due to the presence of several nitrogen and oxygen containing groups in the molecule fig 1 redox active minerals in soils i e minerals containing fe iii and mn iv play an important role in transformation of polar organic pollutants pignatello et al 2006 remucal and ginder vogel 2014 zhang and huang 2005a 2005b and can be used for degradation of pollutants in wastewater treatment technologies liu et al 2016 birnessite was found to efficiently oxidize a wide range of organic compounds and reactions were typically accompanied by reductive dissolution of the mineral remucal and ginder vogel 2014 birnessite was reported to enhance the oxidative removal of oxytetracycline from solution with half life time of approximately 0 25 min rubert and pedersen 2006 chen and huang 2011 proposed a second order reaction rate involving surface complexation of oxytetracycline by birnessite followed by oxytetracycline mn electron transfer they detected 4 tps in solution formed during degradation of oxytetracycline and suggested oxytetracycline birnessite interactions involved radical formation as the major pathway of oxytetracycline degradation chen and huang 2011 mechanisms of oxytetracycline removal by mineral surfaces from water were previously reported however oxidation processes were studied for short term reactions 45 h daghrir and drogui 2013 though oxidation of a compound by mineral surfaces can take longer than its removal from solution chen and huang 2010 moreover although oxytetracycline is considered not persistent in natural aqueous systems only few tps formed during these short term reactions were observed in solutions chen and huang 2011 remucal and ginder vogel 2014 rubert and pedersen 2006 however to understand the behavior and transformation of organic pollutants in environmental systems the presence of pollutant tps should be tested in both liquid and solid phases surface bound tps the objective of this study was to elucidate the mechanisms of oxytetracycline adsorption and abiotic oxidative transformation by two minerals fe iii saturated montmorillonite fe swy and birnessite δ mno2 during longer periods of oxytetracycline mineral interactions up to 7 days detailed mechanisms of the adsorption and transformation of oxytetracycline were constructed which considered both dissolved and surface bound tps montmorillonite was chosen as a common clay mineral in semiarid soils singer 2007 which is characterized by high surface area ratner zohar et al 1983 iron oxides which are intimately bound to soil minerals johnston and tombacz 2002 kubicki et al 1999 are important redox active components of soil particle surfaces hence we used fe swy as redox active mineral surface with large surface area the experiments performed with this type of sorbent allowed observing adsorption and transformation processes of oxytetracycline which might occur in environmental systems another redox active mineral is naturally abundant birnessite δ mno2 remucal and ginder vogel 2014 chosen minerals are characterized by different reduction potentials structure and surface area and thus are expected to demonstrate distinct reactivity towards oxytetracycline oxidation in this study we tested the following hypotheses i oxidation of oxytetracycline during one week will be more intense by δ mno2 than by fe swy due to higher reduction potential of mn iv as compared to fe iii ii kinetics and mechanisms of adsorption and transformation as well as tps will differ for each mineral due to different oxidation efficiency of fe iii and mn iv containing minerals iii radicals are involved in transformation of oxytetracycline by both minerals examined to test these hypotheses study of adsorptive transformation mechanism of oxytetracycline by fe swy and δ mno2 was performed 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals

area of reduced metal to area of oxidized metal for the high energy peak 2p 3 2 2 7 electrochemistry experiments electrochemistry experiments were carried out with oxytetracycline solution to simulate radical mechanism of oxytetracycline decomposition on mineral surfaces and to compare tps that are formed in electrochemistry experiments to the tps produced due to oxytetracycline oxidation by mineral seiwert et al 2016 electrochemistry conversion was performed with a flow rate of 10 μl min 1 in a system consisting of a reactorcell equipped with a boron doped diamond or glassy carbon working electrode and a roxy potentiostat which was controlled by dialoge software antec the netherlands the oxytetracycline solution contained 20 mm of ammonium acetate buffer at ph 4 0 and 6 4 to simulate ph of oxytetracycline fe swy and oxytetracycline δ mno2 suspensions respectively and 25 of meoh aliquots of solutions used in these experiments were analyzed within several hours after collection by lc hrms 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal of oxytetracycline by mineral surfaces changes in mineral structure and solution composition removal of oxytetracycline by minerals and the accompanying reductive dissolution of mineral surfaces were different for the two oxytetracycline mineral systems though in both systems oxytetracycline was present as zwitterion ph of oxytetracycline fe swy and oxytetracycline δ mno2 system was 4 and 7 respectively tavares and mcguffin 1994 with the dimethylamino group of oxytetracycline fig 1 interacting with the negatively charged mineral surfaces carrasquillo et al 2008 chen and huang 2010 figueroa and mackay 2005 wang et al 2015b the ph in each oxytetracycline mineral system was constant during all experiments oxytetracycline was completely removed from solution by fe swy during the first hour recovered fraction of surface bound oxytetracycline from fe swy decreased with time figure s1 a about 26 of oxytetracycline was recovered from fe swy surface even after a week to elucidate the role of mineral structure in oxytetracycline adsorption and to test its interlayer sorption kulshrestha et al 2004 wu et al 2013 changes in basal spacing were measured during adsorption experiment basal spacing of fe swy in the absence of oxytetracycline was 13 å figure s2 a while during oxytetracycline adsorption the basal spacing increased to 14 7 å for oxytetracycline at an initial concentration of 54 μm and to 18 4 å for 540 μm the basal spacing reached its maximal expansion in 6 h basal spacing widening can occur due to steric re arrangement of oxytetracycline molecules following adsorption in the interlayer spaces or due to penetration of tps into the interlayer spacing or owing to both processes oxytetracycline adsorption was accompanied by the dissolution of iron which was noticeable as the concentration of total dissolved iron increased with time figure s1 b the total iron concentration might include both fe ii and fe iii species since no dissolved fe was observed in control samples it can be suggested that three types of iron species are released into solution fe ii or fe iii complexed with organic molecules oxytetracycline or tps or free fe ii ion formation of fe ii in solution during incubation of oxytetracycline with fe swy was confirmed by ferrozine test data not shown formation of soluble complexes of fe ii with organic molecules might prevent fe ii from oxidation theis and singer 1974 oxytetracycline was neither detected in solution after 1 h of incubation with δ mno2 nor was recovered from δ mno2 surface during one week experiment figure s1 a these results are in accordance with data of rubert and pedersen 2006 who showed that 70 of oxytetracycline at initial concentration of 25 μm was removed from solution within the first few minutes of reaction due to its oxidation by mno2 surface no changes in the basal spacing of untreated δ mno2 7 3 å and oxytetracycline treated δ mno2 were observed during the reaction time figure s2 b hence oxytetracycline δ mno2 interactions occurred only on the external surface of oxide no mn ii was observed in solution of control system δ mno2 suspended in double deionized water whereas significant concentrations of mn ii was detected in solution of oxytetracycline treated δ mno2 as reaction progressed figure s1 b higher concentration of dissolved mn as compared to fe can be explained by the following reasons i greater reduction potential of mn iv than that of fe iii and ii fe swy has a layered structure thus containing fe iii on its external and internal surfaces hence ferrous iron formed due to fe iii reduction by oxytetracycline can remain immobilized in the interlayer surfaces preventing its dissolution by contrast oxytetracycline reaction with mn ii occurs on the external surface only thus mn ii though might be adsorbed to the oxide surface rennert et al 2005 is released into solution release of mn ii from the surface produces new active sites on mineral surfaces thus providing higher oxidation capacity of δ mno2 towards oxytetracycline 3 2 adsorptive oxidation of oxytetracycline by mineral surfaces impact on surface atomic composition though both fe iii and mn iv on minerals surfaces were reduced our results clearly demonstrated difference in behavior of metals in oxytetracycline mineral systems 3 2 1 iron and manganese xps spectra of iron of oxytetracycline treated fe swy showed an increase in peak area of fe ii with time hence incubation of oxytetracycline with fe swy resulted in fe ii accumulation on the surface with time fig 2 a c control samples contained only fe iii on the mineral surface fe ii peak was not detected in their spectra fig s3 a b table s1 b shows that the amount of total fe on fe swy surface was within the narrow range of 1 49 1 73 indicating that most of the iron stayed on the mineral surfaces apparently because it remained in the interlayer space however as reaction proceeds the fe ii content increased from 0 to 33 with a corresponding decrease in fe iii as a result the surface reduction ratio of fe swy table s1b which characterizes the relative amount of reduced to oxidized metal on mineral surface increased with time until fe ii became more dominant than fe iii mn ii peak decreased until it disappeared with increasing incubation time fig 2 d f and percent of reduced mn ii species from the total mn on the surface dropped with time from 4 to 0 simultaneously the peak area of mn iv increased from 55 to 85 from the total mn table s1 b reduction of δ mno2 surface was accompanied by mn ii accumulation in solution figure s2 b mn ii was present on the surface of control samples after 1 h of incubation figure s3 c this can be explained by a process occurring during δ mno2 synthesis described in text s1 however after 96 h of incubation mn ii disappeared from the mineral surface in control samples due to dissolution figure s3 d significant changes in δ mno2 surface composition disagree with previous findings by jiang et al who studied oxytetracycline interactions with natural birnessite and reported only negligible changes in surface mn iv jiang et al 2014 it appears that intensity of surface redox properties of manganese oxides depend on their structure this issue needs further investigation the decrease in mn ii concentration on the surface and its increase in solution implies that the redox process is mainly responsible for the removal of oxytetracycline from solution 3 2 2 carbon carbohydrates are present on each mineral surface and thus the peak at 285 ev attributed to c h c c groups is used as a reference in xps measurements yamashita and hayes 2008 for both mineral control samples no significant changes were observed in c spectra in the absence of oxytetracycline i e peak areas did not change with the incubation time except for disappearance of the carbonyl peak 289 ev fig s4 which can be explained by dissolution of polar species carbon atomic concentration on the mineral surfaces nearly doubles with oxytetracycline addition table s1 a spectra of oxytetracycline treated samples showed an increase in the peak area of the more oxidized forms of carbon 287 ev and the formation of carboxylic group with time 290 291 ev which demonstrated that oxytetracycline oxidation on the mineral surfaces enhanced as reaction progressed fig 3 a c and fig s5 for both minerals c o fraction 287 and 289 ev peaks constantly increased whereas fraction of c h decreased due to faster reaction kinetics of δ mno2 as compared to fe swy carboxylic group 290 291 ev was noticed for δ mno2 after 24 h whereas for fe swy it was observed after 96 h unlike oxytetracycline fe swy system fig s5 oxygen bound carbon 287 ev in oxytetracycline δ mno2 system became the dominant species on the surface fig 3 different kinetics and intensity of oxytetracycline oxidative transformation by fe swy and δ mno2 demonstrates the distinct behavior of minerals towards oxytetracycline δ mno2 is acting as a faster and stronger oxidizer than fe swy due to higher reduction potential of mn iv and owing to exposure of newly formed sites on the δ mno2 surface as reductive dissolution of the mineral progresses 3 2 3 oxygen in the absence of oxytetracycline no changes in oxygen spectra and peak areas were observed fig s6 thus both minerals exhibited no change in surface oxygen species during incubation oxygen spectra of oxytetracycline treated δ mno2 showed a decrease in o mn peaks 530 ev which agrees with reductive dissolution of δ mno2 and an increase in carbon bound oxygen 532 and 534 ev fig 3 d f similar behavior of surface c and o was observed for other organic contaminants oxidized by manganese oxide surface shaikh et al 2016 oxygen spectra of oxytetracycline treated fe swy indicate minor fe oxide formation with time fig s7 which might occur due to oxidation of fe ii by atmospheric oxygen spectra of surface oxygen for oxytetracycline treated fe swy show less significant changes as compared with δ mno2 spectra due to lower oxidizing intensity of fe swy and dominance of silicone bound oxygen in this system 3 3 mechanisms of oxytetracycline oxidative transformation by fe swy and δ mno2 two major processes oxidation and hydrolysis control the abiotic transformation of oxytetracycline in the aqueous fe swy and δ mno2 systems tps which are formed in the processes of oxytetracycline transformation can accumulate or continue transforming on the mineral surface or in solution in this work we suggested the processes and pathways of abiotic oxytetracycline transformation in the aqueous oxytetracycline fe swy and oxytetracycline δ mno2 systems at ph 4 and 7 respectively based on the tps chemical formulas which we constructed using lc hrms data obtained during 7 days of oxytetracycline and tps interaction with minerals oxytetracycline alone in the absence of minerals can undergo hydrolysis in solution however the products of oxytetracycline hydrolysis may also interact with the mineral surfaces formation of some hydrolysis products were enhanced in the presence of mineral surfaces and others were found at higher concentrations in the absence of minerals i e in control samples containing oxytetracycline only in table s2 the former is denoted as enhanced in the presence of mineral and the latter as diminished in the presence of mineral decrease in the concentration of hydrolysis products in the presence of minerals can be explained by their further transformation or their adsorption on the mineral surfaces based on all collected data we proposed mechanisms of oxytetracycline transformation by each mineral fig 4 a and b a list of all tps observed in both systems is shown in table s2 we suppose that not all tps which were formed in oxytetracycline mineral systems were detected because high polarity of tps and low m z ratio 50 m z might impede their detection by the instrument thus dashed arrows in fig 4 symbolize further decomposition of tps to undetected tps structural isomers were considered as the same tps in the mechanism but were differentiated in the tps list table s2 kinetic behavior of tps which were degraded or accumulated in solution during 7 days of the experiment was characterized by plotting the integrated peak areas versus time table s2 kinetics of the surface bound tps behavior was not characterized because extraction process was conducted only after a week incubation of oxytetracycline with minerals twenty nine tps were found in oxytetracycline fe swy system 13 of them were surface bound 23 were found in solution few tps were found in both phases molecular weight of some tps was significantly smaller than that of oxytetracycline indicating breakdown of the molecular structure during oxidation fig 4 a i tp481 underwent ring opening accompanied by loss of its dimethyl amino group and decarbonylation c2h7n co which resulted in tp408 formation another pathway of tp481 decomposition producing tp364 involved loss of the tricarbonylamide group and 4 hydrogens c4h3no3 4h ii tp209 fe denoted so because it was detected in oxytetracycline fe swy system to distinguish from tp209 mn and tp211 were formed due to breakage of tp423 4h iii tp423 also broke into tp196 and tp217 after loss of ch2no decarbonylation and hydration ch2no co h2o tp217 recombined with another tp217 molecule followed by oxidation o to produce tp425 tp449 was generated in a two step process oxytetracycline h2o co2 2h o and tp431 tp449 h2o were previously observed in solution for oxytetracycline oxidative transformation by carbonate radical liu et al 2016 oxytetracycline oxidative transformation in the δ mno2 system differed from the fe swy in terms of kinetics and chemical formulas of formed tps since oxidation kinetics in this system was much faster samples were collected and analyzed in short time intervals during the first hour of reaction as well as in long time intervals of up to a week presence of oxygen did not affect the mechanism in the first minutes and thus it was concluded that the mechanism of oxidation is not initiated by reactive oxygen species originating from molecular oxygen oxytetracycline was not found in the system shortly after the reaction started totally 54 tps were detected 50 of these tps could be incorporated into one scheme of transformation table s2 fig 3 b in contrast to the oxytetracycline fe swy system all tps produced in oxytetracycline δ mno2 system were detected only in solution none was surface bound breakage of tp molecules was observed in the following cases i tp477 broke to tp285 and tp213 and ii tp426 broke to tp163 and tp209 mn denoted so because it was detected in oxytetracycline δ mno2 system to distinguish from tp209 fe after loss of amine and oxygen o nh3 a recombination reaction is proposed to form tp640 by addition of tp180 to an oxytetracycline molecule such reaction is not expected to occur at low environmental concentrations of oxytetracycline loss of dimethyl amino group was observed twice in this reaction system at the formation of tp170 tp213 c2h5n and tp426 tp447 c2h5n formation of tp447 and tp477 resulting from oxytetracycline demethylation and hydroxylation respectively was previously reported by chen and huang for oxytetracycline oxidation by δ mno2 chen and huang 2011 they suggested that tp447 was formed due to n demethylation of oxytetracycline i e loss of ch3 at n ch3 2 group tp640 that was found in the studied oxytetracycline δ mno2 system was similar to tp639 detected by chen and huang 2011 liu et al 2015 2016 demonstrated participation of hydroxyl and carbonate radicals in oxytetracycline degradation in uv h2o2 systems liu et al 2015 2016 eight tps which were detected in their work were also identified in the studied oxytetracycline δ mno2 system this suggests involvement of radicals in oxytetracycline degradation by δ mno2 besides oxytetracycline degradation in different redox systems was previously shown to be radical wang et al 2015b 2015a zhao et al 2013 to test the role of hydroxyl radicals in oxytetracycline oxidation by δ mno2 the hydroxyl radical scavenger tert butanol piechowski et al 1992 was added to the oxytetracycline δ mno2 system at different concentrations the presence of tert butanol suppressed oxytetracycline degradation higher concentrations of oxytetracycline remained in the system with increasing concentration of added tert butanol data not shown this confirms the participation of radicals in oxytetracycline degradation by δ mno2 to better understand the role of radicals in oxytetracycline degradation and tps formation electrochemical experiments were performed with oxytetracycline solution the reactions simulated by electrochemistry are oxidation by addition of oxygen quinonization demethylation deamination and dehydration jurva et al 2003 in this system voltage is applied 0 5 2 0 v to the electrode seiwert et al 2016 and oxytetracycline degradation occurred due to a surface reaction by direct contact of oxytetracycline with the electrode followed by oxidation and organic radical formation in case of glassy carbon electrode simonet 2013 or due to formation of hydroxyl radicals in solution i e indirect reaction in case of boron doped diamond electrode marselli et al 2003 seiwert et al 2015 as the spectrum of tps generated with the boron doped diamond and the glassy carbon electrode was identical it appears that oxidation on the electrode surface and in solution both contributed to oxytetracycline transformation and both types of radicals hydroxyl and organic might be involved in the process of oxytetracycline oxidation similarity of tps detected in electrochemistry and in oxytetracycline δ mno2 systems are shown in table s3 eight of the tps formed by electrochemical oxidation are identical to those detected in the δ mno2 system similar tps formed during the first minutes of oxytetracycline δ mno2 interaction i e at the initial steps of the process advanced and more complex oxidation reactions could probably not be simulated because of the short contact time of oxytetracycline with the electrode by comparison no similarity was found between tps formed electrochemically and in oxytetracycline fe swy system based on the similarity of tps obtained in electrochemistry and oxytetracycline δ mno2 systems we suggest two pathways of oxytetracycline oxidation by δ mno2 involving participation of radicals i oxytetracycline δ mno2 interactions induce formation of hydroxyl radicals which degrade oxytetracycline and tps ii oxytetracycline molecules are directly oxidized by δ mno2 to form organic radicals which are transformed on the mineral surface reacting with other tps on the surface or in solution 3 4 comparison of redox transformations in oxytetracycline fe swy and oxytetracycline δ mno2 systems major features overall the examined minerals varied in kinetics of oxytetracycline transformations number and structures of tps and mechanisms of oxytetracycline mineral interactions oxytetracycline interactions with the examined minerals resulted in different products except for two tps tp431 and tp189 that were detected in both systems but exhibited different behavior in time table s2 oxytetracycline degradation by fe swy was less efficient than by δ mno2 oxytetracycline transformation by δ mno2 involved two oxidations reactions producing tp477 and tp447 which lead to the formation of more than 90 of tps in the system fast kinetics of oxytetracycline oxidation in δ mno2 system complicates the understanding of the role of mineral surface in oxytetracycline transformation it is unclear whether further degradation of tps occurs due to encounter with the surface or in solution in contrast relatively slow kinetics of oxytetracycline fe swy interactions allowed easy monitoring the reactions in the system and thus facilitated the comprehension of the mineral surface role in oxytetracycline oxidation 4 conclusions oxytetracycline degradation by fe and mn containing surfaces results in the formation of numerous tps and their environmental fate is still unknown both fe and mn containing surfaces remove oxytetracycline from solution and induce its degradation thus impeding antibiotic impact on microorganisms δ mno2 behaves as a fast and efficient oxidizer whereas fe swy acts as an effective sorbent with oxytetracycline oxidative degradation gradually developing with time fast removal and advanced degradation of oxytetracycline by δ mno2 were accompanied by the release of multiple tps into solution on the contrary the high sorption capacity of fe swy can prevent oxytetracycline from being released back to solution oxytetracycline was not found in the presence of δ mno2 after a few minutes of incubation whereas only partial removal of the parent compound by fe swy during a week poses a potential risk of its activity in the environment the results of this study undercut the assumption of oxytetracycline s low stability in environment since radicals are involved in degradation of oxytetracycline by δ mno2 natural radical scavengers i e dissolved organic matter are likely to influence the pathways and mechanism of oxytetracycline transformation in the environment in this study we found that epi oxytetracycline α apo oxytetracycline and β apo oxytetracycline which are commonly used as model tps to monitor oxytetracycline degradation in various experimental systems are only short lived minutes intermediates in the process of the oxytetracycline transformation by δ mno2 hence their application in the experimental studies related to the environmental fate of oxytetracycline is questionable a combination of the two redox active minerals which varied in adsorption and oxidative efficiencies might be useful for removal of organic pollutants and their tps from water appendix a supplementary data the following is the supplementary data related to this article
