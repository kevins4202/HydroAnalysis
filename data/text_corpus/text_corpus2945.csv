14725,as a primary driving force of global methane production methanogens like other living organisms are exposed to an environment filled with dynamic electromagnetic waves which might induce electromotive force emf to potentially influence the metabolism of methanogens however no reports have been found on the effects of the induced electromotive force on methane production in this study we found that exposure to a dynamic magnetic field enhanced bio methanogenesis via the induced electromotive force when exposed to a dynamic magnetic field with 0 20 to 0 40 mt of intensity the methane emission of the sediments increased by 41 71 the respiration of methanogens and bacteria was accelerated by the emf as the ratios of f420h2 f420 and nad nadh of the sediment increased by 44 12 and 55 56 respectively the respiratory enzymes in respiration chains might be polarized with the emf to accelerate the proton coupled electron transfer to enhance microbial metabolism together with the enriched exoelectrogens and electrotrophic methanogens as well as the increased sediment electro activities this study indicated that the emf could enhance the electron exchange among extracellular respiratory microorganisms to increase the methane emission from sediments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic system bio methanation bio electro chemistry

ranging from 20 at the equator to 70 μt at the poles and the electromagnetic induction between an active microorganism and geomagnetic field can also produce the induced electromotive force emf about

silicone tube inner diagram φ of 4 8 mm filled with the activated sediments was used as the reactor for the open circuit potential ocp test a glassy carbon electrode φ 3 mm working area 0 07 mm2 and an ag agcl electrode φ 4 mm 50 mm were inserted into the sediment of the two ends of the silicone tube as the working electrode and reference electrode respectively which then were connected with an electrochemical station fig s1 the distance between the two electrodes was kept to 25 mm the silicone tube was horizontally placed on a shelf above a rotatable electromagnet with a surface magnetic intensity of 38 56 mt at a height of 150 mm the rotatable at the frequency of 1 hz electromagnet was to cut the magnetic force line and form a dynamical magnetic field referred to as dm 2 3 setup and operation in this study two groups in triplicate of serum bottles working volume 250 ml max volume 280 ml were used as the reactors of artificial wetland systems 5 0 g of the activated sediments and 240 ml synthetic glucose based wastewater initial cod concentration of 2000 mg l tab s1 were added into the serum bottles to be incubated at 25 1 c the operation time was divided into three stages and every stage lasted for 16 days after one stage ended concentrated synthetic glucose based wastewater was added to the serum bottles and replace the supernatant which kept the initial concentration and volume of each stage the same two rotatable electromagnets at the frequency of 1 hz with similar functions as the electromagnets used above were placed below the two groups of serum bottles at a distance of 150 mm to provide the dynamic magnetic field referred to as the dm group or static field referred to as the control group respectively the magnetic intensity determined in the sediments ranged from 0 20 to 0 40 mt for the dm group and was 0 30 mt for the control group before the operation the bottles with a cap were aerated with n2 for 15 min to provide an anaerobic condition a gas bag was connected to the cap to collect the produced gas every day methane produced from the two groups was analyzed with a gas chromatograph shimadzu gc 14c every day 2 4 detection of co enzymes and enzymes after treatment the sediments of the dm group and control group were collected the sediment solutions were centrifuged at 2100 g rcf and dispersed in 0 02 mol l pbs solution with 1 mmol l pmsf added ph 7 4 then the solutions were ultrasonicated for 20 min operation for 5 s and pause for 10 s in an ice water bath the concentrations of co enzymes and the activity of enzymes in the collected solution were detected with the elisa kits respectively tab s2 2 5 electrochemical measurements 200 μl of sediments solutions were taken out and homogeneously coated on a glassy carbon electrode to conduct the electrochemical tests with a workstation chi 660 chenhua instrument china the coated glassy carbon electrode ag agcl electrode and a pt sheet were used as the working reference and counter electrodes respectively cyclic voltammetry cv test and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis were conducted to evaluate the capacitances and conductivity of the sediments and the detailed conditions of the cv and eis test were provided in the supporting information 2 6 in situ fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectra for the electrochemical in situ fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir test sediments in the same concentration were coated on a pt electrode serving as the working electrode and an ag agcl electrode and pt sheet were used as the reference and counter electrodes respectively all electrodes were set into the ir cells as the single chamber reactor and d2o was utilized as the electrolyte to avoid the dosage effect on the spectra the working potential in a gradient from 0 8 v to 0 4 v was provided by a workstation chi 660 chenhua instrument china for the fitr the wavenumber range was set to 500 4500 cm 1 2 7 kinetic isotope effect kie test to evaluate the kie on current production sediment solutions were taken out centrifuged and redispersed to the same od 600 level after aeration with 20 co2 balanced in n2 co2 n2 20 80 for 30 min the solutions were conducted with chronoamperometry a glassy carbon electrode with the same quality of sediments covered an ag agcl electrode and a pt electrode were used as the working reference and counter electrodes respectively the working potential was set to 0 3 v vs ag agcl after the current became stable within the anaerobic condition d2o was added to the electrolyte with a volume ratio of 2 0 synthetic wastewater was added continuously to keep the electron transfer process active 2 8 detection of membrane potential the activated sediments were dispersed at a concentration of 5 0 g l in the synthetic wastewater tab s1 after the addition of the thioflavin t tht the fluorescent dye at the concentration of 10 mm the sediments were incubated at 25 c for 45 min to avoid the possible effects on observation a field coil was used to provide the static magnetic field 0 30 mt and dynamic magnetic field 0 20 0 40 mt 1 hz respectively the samples were placed at the center of the field coil and the fluorescent intensities of the sediments were detected with an inverted fluorescence microscope olympus ix 83 with an interval of 100 s specifically the optical grating was kept closed during the intervals to decrease the cancellation of the dye the fluorescent images were further analyzed by imagej 3 results and discussion 3 1 generation of emf to promote methane production in wetland sediment effects of dynamic magnetic intensity on voltage generation were assessed in the simulated wetland sediment under the static magnetic field 0 30 s the voltage the open circuit potential ocp between the two ends of the sediment filled silicone tube was maintained at a background level around 48 54 mv vs ag agcl fig 1 when the electromagnet rotated horizontally to form the dynamic magnetic field 30 80 s the dramatical fluctuations of ocp were detected in which meant that the maximum of ocp discrepancy reached up to 5 73 μv under the dynamic magnetic field compared to the background voltage under the static magnetic field when backed to the static magnetic field 80 100 s the ocp rapidly declined and recovered to the initial background voltage sediments inoculated in simulated wetland systems were placed above the static rotatory magnets respectively to verify the potential effects of the emf on methane production in sediments with the dynamic magnetic field the accumulated methane production of the dm group 98 17 5 08 ml 204 52 10 58 ml g cod was 41 71 higher than the control 69 27 10 26 ml 144 31 21 375 ml g cod with the static magnetic field during the experiment for 16 days fig 2 noteworthily the methane production of the dm group 32 23 2 70 ml was 2 07 folds that of the control group 16 15 5 03 ml in the initial 4 days meanwhile in the second and third stages the methane emission of the sediments in the dm group was also significantly higher than that of the control which was consistent with the results of the first stage fig s2 since methane is the end product of the cellular respiration of methanogens in the sediments evans et al 2019 the increased methane production represented an exuberant bio methanation that was directly associated with the intensified cellular respiration and metabolism of methanogens 3 2 emf induced changes in the microbial community structure of the sediments after 16 days of incubation methanoscrcina typical electrotrophic methanogens that can accept electrons from exoelectrogens to produce methane via direct interspecies electron transfer diet liu et al 2012 rotaru et al 2014 was enriched with the emf stimulation as the relative abundance 70 76 in the sediments of the dm group was higher than the control 59 38 fig 3 tab s3 although methanoscrcina could also use h2 as the electron donator the relative abundance of strictly hydrogenotrophic methanogen methanomassiliicoccus dridi et al 2012 lena et al 2017 decreased from 19 38 to 12 19 with the presence of emf indicating that the diet based methanogenesis likely contributed to the methane increment in the dm group moreover the relative abundances of lysinibacillus a type of exoelectrogen with conductive pili like appendages li et al 2021 yang et al 2021 increased by 6 50 folds with the presence of emf tab s4 which was likely to exchange electrons with methanogenesis to produce methane unlike the h2 that is reduced in the cytoplasm electrotrophic methanogenesis relies on the respiratory proteins like vhoc in the inner membrane to directly accept electrons from exoelectrogens for further electron transportation borrel et al 2019 microorganisms capable of donating accepting electrons through the respiratory enzymes on cell membranes were enriched with the emf indicating that the respiratory chains on the cell surface were more likely to be affected by emf considering that the cell envelopes including cell membrane and cell walls were circuits to generate the emf with the variation of magnetic flux the emf might affect the respiratory enzymes on the cell envelopes to promote the metabolism and growth of electrotrophic methanogens methanoscrcina and exoelectrogens lysinibacillus 3 3 enhanced electron transfer along respiration chains with emf f420 is the essential co factor that accepts electrons from inner cellular membrane proteins like fpo chadwick et al 2022 of methanogens to generate f420h2 that provides reducing power for co2 reduction the f420h2 f420 ratio of the sediments in the dm group 0 98 was higher increased by 44 12 than that of the control group 0 68 to drive the co2 reduction and methane yield which indicated that the electron donation from the respiratory proteins was more efficient in the conversion of f420 to f420h2 fig 4 and tab s5 similarly the nad nadh ratio of the sediments in the dm group 2 38 was higher increased by 55 56 than that of the control group 1 53 saura and kaila 2019 complex i in bacterial respiration chains accepts electrons from nadh and generate the nad and the depletion of electron acceptors or the stuck electron transfer in respiration chains cause drawbacks for the conversion of nadh to nad hirst 2013 therefore the higher nad nadh ratio in the sediments of the dm group indicated that the respiration chains on the bacterial cell membrane were likely to be more active with the dynamic magnetic field to oxidize nadh the concentration changes of the cofactors f420 and nadh indicated that the emf likely accelerated the electron transfer in the respiration chains of methanogens and bacteria the enzyme activity of respiratory proteins that serve as the reaction centers in respiration chains determines the rates of respiratory reactions and electron transfer as expected the activity of the specific respiration enzymes on respiration chains complex i and complex iii all increased with the dynamic magnetic field tab s3 especially the enzyme activity of complex i in the dm group 0 506 0 28 u was 1 38 folds of the control 0 367 0 10 u and the activity of complex iii in the dm group 0 589 0 35 u increased by 36 compared with control 0 433 0 22 u tab s3 with the presence of emf the increased activity of respiration enzymes accelerated the electron transfer along respiration chains to forward the reduction of f420 or the oxidation of nadh the secretion of respiration enzymes was closely related to cell respiration however the metatranscriptome sequencing test showed that the genes related to the biosynthesis of respiratory enzymes such as nuoc for complex i synthesis and frha for fpo synthesis were not significantly up regulated with the effects of emf alex et al 1990 schimpf et al 2022 therefore the presence of emf did not enhance the secretion of respiratory enzymes by regulating gene transcription and expression however the genes such as ubie and mqnd associated with the biosynthesis of quinones fig 5 were upregulated in the sediments with the dmf tab s6 hiratsuka et al 2008 lee et al 1997 quinones hydroquinones the switchable redox mediators have been extensively reported to shuttle electrons among respiratory enzymes in respiration chains sarewicz and osyczka 2015 the significantly up regulated genes associated with the biosynthesis of quinones might benefit the electron transfer along with respiration chains 3 4 emf induced modification of protein like substances benefited electron transfer in sediment the cv curves showed that the capacitance 1 92 f of the sediments in the dm group increased by 33 33 compared with that of the control group 1 44 f fig 6 the increased capacitance of the sediments meant that more electron storage sites were available for electron exchange among the microorganisms the eis results also showed that the internal resistance of the dm group was lower than the control and the conductivity of the sediments increased from 1164 μs cm to 1258 μs cm with the dynamic magnetic field applied showing the acceleration of electron transfer in the sediments the electro activities such as conductivity and capacitance were commonly used as indicators to evaluate the extracellular respiration in microbial aggregations as is extensively reported electrical stimulations e g directly applying potential or voltage improved the electro activities of microbial communities to promote the electron flowing from exoelectrogens to electrotrophic methanogens jiang et al 2022 wang et al 2020 accordingly the induced emf could act similarly to directly applied electrical stimulations potential or voltage our previous study found that a voltage imposed on the sludge cell caused the polarization of amide groups and the depolarization of n h the protein like substances leading to improved dielectric properties capacitance and accelerated electron transfer conductivity yu and zhang 2019 with the emf the electro induced polarization of respiratory enzymes in the cell membrane might occur to assist electron transfer in respiration chains as well as the sediments to verify this speculation the sediments were further charicterized with electrochemical in situ ftir spectroscopy to detect the responses of functional groups in sediments to electrical signals the testing potentials yu et al 2015 as shown in fig 7 the intensities of c n bands around 1550 cm 1 and c o bands bands around 1650 cm 1 in the amide groups of dmf free sediments control group showed fewer changes and were lower than that of the dm group yu and zhang 2019 indicating that the amide groups of dmf free sediments were inert to the electric signals comparatively for the sediments of the dm group the intensities of c n and c o bands in amide groups showed an obvious increasing trend as the potential shifted from 0 9 v to 0 4 v indicating that c n and c o in amide groups were polarized by the testing potentials the polarity was reported positively associated with the relative permittivity indicating the material s capacitance dubois et al 2004 therefore the polarized amide groups could increase the capacitance of protein like substances in the sediment the polarization of amide groups i e c n and c o in the sediments of the dm group led to the electrons escaping from the nuclear of n and o atoms to be more likely to get engaged in electron transfer meanwhile c n and c o in amide groups were reported to be essential sites for electron transfer in protein like substances niki et al 2003 expressly c o could accept protons or h radicals to form c o h to transport electrons termed proton coupled electron transfer sawicka et al 2010 the polarized amide groups of cell surfaces meant that more electrons in higher energy states could participate in the electron transfer via the proton coupled pattern a d h kinetic isotope effect kie test was conducted to verify the proton coupled electron transfer in the current of the sediment okamoto et al 2017 before adding the heavy water d2o the initial current of the dm group was 1 62 fold of the control fig 8 indicating a higher conductivity of the sediments after the emf treatment after the d2o addition the current of the dm and control groups both decreased continuously in d h kie tests d atoms possess a higher mass than the h atoms when the d atoms in d2o replaced h atoms proton in h2o the proton motion inevitably slowed down to retard the proton coupled electron transfer pcet in the microbial extracellular respiration which manifested as the decrease in current eventually the current of the two groups was maintained at a lower level than that before adding notably the current decrease of the dm group was more obvious than the control it indicated that the development of h coupled electron transfer after the emf treatment accounted for the increased current of the sediments in this study together with the polarized amide groups of the cell surface in ftir results it seemed that the respiratory enzymes were modified with the emf to enhance electron transfer along with respiration chains which might contribute to the improved reaction activity of the respiratory enzymes in cell respiration respiratory enzymes couple the proton motions to the outside of the cell with the electron transfer to form the membrane potential for atp generation hirst 2013 saura and kaila 2019 wu et al 2020 the development of proton coupled electron transfer after emf stimulation potentially increased the proton accumulation outside microbial cells to increase the membrane potential for atp generation to verify the possible changes in membrane potential the sediment aggregation was stained with thioflavin t tht the fluorescent dye that could be absorbed into the inside of cells when the membrane potential increases under a static dynamic magnetic field liu et al 2015 prindle et al 2015 from the results of fluorescent images fig 9 when applying a static magnetic field 0 3 mt the membrane potential of the sediment aggregations showed little changes that ranged from 7 10 1 95 to 10 32 1 73 and was maintained at a relatively stable fluorescence intensity level of 8 01 1 19 when applying a dynamic magnetic field 0 2 0 4 mt the fluorescence intensities of the sediment aggregations increased to a higher level 13 72 2 11 and showed apparent fluctuations ranging from 8 35 2 42 to 17 79 2 43 the increased fluorescence intensity of the sediment aggregations represented the hyperpolarization of the bacterial cells which was caused by the increased membrane potential to cellular internalization of tht tht has been widely used as a fluorescent cationic dye to identify the membrane potential prindle et al 2015 microbial cells with the inside negative electrical membrane potential could retain tht in cells as the tht is positively charged the membrane potential of microbial cells is more negative the more tht could be retained therefore the accelerated pcet of respiratory enzymes could induce more proton outflow to make the membrane potential more negative in the cell respiration of bacteria and methanogens the outflow of h ions accompanied by electron transfer increased membrane potential and formed the h gradient proton motive force pmf and atp could be generated accompanied by the inflow of h irons to convert the pmf to chemical energy courbon and rubinstein 2022 therefore the higher and markedly varied membrane potential with the emf was likely the result of the enhanced proton coupled electron transfer that occurred in the respiratory enzymes with emf figs 7 and 8 which benefited the atp synthesis as well as the growth of exoelectrogens and electrotrophic methanogens that exchanged electrons via their respiration chains 3 5 implications electrochemical strategies e g bio electrochemical systems have been extensively reported to promote the methane production of anaerobic systems wang et al 2022b zhao et al 2016 however the electro driven methanation has been reported to account for a quite low proportion of the methane increment jiang et al 2022 zakaria and ranjan dhar 2021 the electro induced improvement in the electro activities such as the conductivity and capacitance of microbial aggregations could accelerate the electron transfer among microorganisms to promote the diet based methanogenesis which contributed to the majority of the methane increment with electrical stimulation as expected the emf induced by the relative motion between microorganisms and the magnetic field could play a similar role as the electrical stimulations in bio electrochemical systems apart from the enrichment of exoelectrogens and electrotrophic methanogens amide groups of protein like substances were polarized with the emf considering that c o bonds in amide groups provide the hydrogen bond skeleton of protein secondary structures like α helix pauling and corey 1950 the secondary structures of protein complexes may change with the polarization of c o bonds in amide groups to accelerate the electron transfer coupled with proton motions in proteins chen et al 2010 the coupling of proton and electron transport was a basic form for respiratory enzymes to increase the membrane potential and generate atps fig 10 with the emf a significantly higher potential was observed to benefit the atp generation which indicated that the emf could strengthen the proton coupled electron transfer in respiratory enzymes protein like substances to increase methane production as the applications of telecommunications and power facilities rise the bioelectromagnetic effects of electromagnetic pollution have raised concerns about the potential harm to organism health however the potential impact of electromagnetic pollution on microbial metabolism has long been neglected this study was the first time to reveal that the electromagnetic field could increase the methane emission from sediments it indicated that in the area around magnetic veins submarine cables electric stations et al the variations of the magnetic field induced by the changed electromagnetic waves or runoffs tide might induce emf to aggravate methane emission which could arise nonneglected impacts on global climate meanwhile sediments in the coast and soil are widespread hot spots for biogeochemical interactions hydrological activities like tides zhao et al 2022 as well as the photosynthesis of plants dai et al 2022 bring about intermittent redox turnover in coast and soil which enable microorganisms in sediments to produce reactive oxygen species ros during the microbial respiration applying a dynamic magnetic field promoted microbial respiration in sediments which may help the oxidation of pollutants by accelerating the production of respiration based ross 4 conclusion in summary the study presented here showed that with a dynamic magnetic field the induced emf could increase the methane emission of sediments by 41 71 as an electrical stimulation the emf caused the polarization of amide groups in protein like substances which increased the electro activities of the sediments to promote the electron exchange between exoelectrogens and electrotrophic methanogens notably the polarized respiratory enzymes strengthened the proton motions outflow coupled with electron transfer providing more redox driving force for methane production and higher membrane potential for atp generation the results revealed that the relative motions between sediments and magnets could increase methane production along with the ever increasing exposure to magnetic substances and the intensifying electromagnetic pollution the methane increment caused by electromagnetic induction should cause alarm for it might bring about a nonnegligible threat to the global climate credit authorship

operation in this study two groups in triplicate of serum bottles working volume 250 ml max volume 280 ml were used as the reactors of artificial wetland systems 5 0 g of the activated sediments and 240 ml synthetic glucose based wastewater initial cod concentration of 2000 mg l tab s1 were added into the serum bottles to be incubated at 25 1 c the operation time was divided into three stages and every stage lasted for 16 days after one stage ended concentrated synthetic glucose based wastewater was added to the serum bottles and replace the supernatant which kept the initial concentration and volume of each stage the same two rotatable electromagnets at the frequency of 1 hz with similar functions as the electromagnets used above were placed below the two groups of serum bottles at a distance of 150 mm to provide the dynamic magnetic field referred to as the dm group or static field referred to as the control group respectively the magnetic intensity determined in the sediments ranged from 0 20 to 0 40 mt for the dm group and was 0 30 mt for the control group before the operation the bottles with a cap were aerated with n2 for 15 min to provide an anaerobic condition a gas bag was connected to the cap to collect the produced gas every day methane produced from the two groups was analyzed with a gas chromatograph shimadzu gc 14c every day 2 4 detection of co enzymes and enzymes after treatment the sediments of the dm group and control group were collected the sediment solutions were centrifuged at 2100 g rcf and dispersed in 0 02 mol l pbs solution with 1 mmol l pmsf added ph 7 4 then the solutions were ultrasonicated for 20 min operation for 5 s and pause for 10 s in an ice water bath the concentrations of co enzymes and the activity of enzymes in the collected solution were detected with the elisa kits respectively tab s2 2 5 electrochemical measurements 200 μl of sediments solutions were taken out and homogeneously coated on a glassy carbon electrode to conduct the electrochemical tests with a workstation chi 660 chenhua instrument china the coated glassy carbon electrode ag agcl electrode and a pt sheet were used as the working reference and counter electrodes respectively cyclic voltammetry cv test and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis were conducted to evaluate the capacitances and conductivity of the sediments and the detailed conditions of the cv and eis test were provided in the supporting information 2 6 in situ fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectra for the electrochemical in situ fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir test sediments in the same concentration were coated on a pt electrode serving as the working electrode and an ag agcl electrode and pt sheet were used as the reference and counter electrodes respectively all electrodes were set into the ir cells as the single chamber reactor and d2o was utilized as the electrolyte to avoid the dosage effect on the spectra the working potential in a gradient from 0 8 v to 0 4 v was provided by a workstation chi 660 chenhua instrument china for the fitr the wavenumber range was set to 500 4500 cm 1 2 7 kinetic isotope effect kie test to evaluate the kie on current production sediment solutions were taken out centrifuged and redispersed to the same od 600 level after aeration with 20 co2 balanced in n2 co2 n2 20 80 for 30 min the solutions were conducted with chronoamperometry a glassy carbon electrode with the same quality of sediments covered an ag agcl electrode and a pt electrode were used as the working reference and counter electrodes respectively the working potential was set to 0 3 v vs ag agcl after the current became stable within the anaerobic condition d2o was added to the electrolyte with a volume ratio of 2 0 synthetic wastewater was added continuously to keep the electron transfer process active 2 8 detection of membrane potential the activated sediments were dispersed at a concentration of 5 0 g l in the synthetic wastewater tab s1 after the addition of the thioflavin t tht the fluorescent dye at the concentration of 10 mm the sediments were incubated at 25 c for 45 min to avoid the possible effects on observation a field coil was used to provide the static magnetic field 0 30 mt and dynamic magnetic field 0 20 0 40 mt 1 hz respectively the samples were placed at the center of the field coil and the fluorescent intensities of the sediments were detected with an inverted fluorescence microscope olympus ix 83 with an interval of 100 s specifically the optical grating was kept closed during the intervals to decrease the cancellation of the dye the fluorescent images were further analyzed by imagej 3 results and discussion 3 1 generation of emf to promote methane production in wetland sediment effects of dynamic magnetic intensity on voltage generation were assessed in the simulated wetland sediment under the static magnetic field 0 30 s the voltage the open circuit potential ocp between the two ends of the sediment filled silicone tube was maintained at a background level around 48 54 mv vs ag agcl fig 1 when the electromagnet rotated horizontally to form the dynamic magnetic field 30 80 s the dramatical fluctuations of ocp were detected in which meant that the maximum of ocp discrepancy reached up to 5 73 μv under the dynamic magnetic field compared to the background voltage under the static magnetic field when backed to the static magnetic field 80 100 s the ocp rapidly declined and recovered to the initial background voltage sediments inoculated in simulated wetland systems were placed above the static rotatory magnets respectively to verify the potential effects of the emf on methane production in sediments with the dynamic magnetic field the accumulated methane production of the dm group 98 17 5 08 ml 204 52 10 58 ml g cod was 41 71 higher than the control 69 27 10 26 ml 144 31 21 375 ml g cod with the static magnetic field during the experiment for 16 days fig 2 noteworthily the methane production of the dm group 32 23 2 70 ml was 2 07 folds that of the control group 16 15 5 03 ml in the initial 4 days meanwhile in the second and third stages the methane emission of the sediments in the dm group was also significantly higher than that of the control which was consistent with the results of the first stage fig s2 since methane is the end product of the cellular respiration of methanogens in the sediments evans et al 2019 the increased methane production represented an exuberant bio methanation that was directly associated with the intensified cellular respiration and metabolism of methanogens 3 2 emf induced changes in the microbial community structure of the sediments after 16 days of incubation methanoscrcina typical electrotrophic methanogens that can accept electrons from exoelectrogens to produce methane via direct interspecies electron transfer diet liu et al 2012 rotaru et al 2014 was enriched with the emf stimulation as the relative abundance 70 76 in the sediments of the dm group was higher than the control 59 38 fig 3 tab s3 although methanoscrcina could also use h2 as the electron donator the relative abundance of strictly hydrogenotrophic methanogen methanomassiliicoccus dridi et al 2012 lena et al 2017 decreased from 19 38 to 12 19 with the presence of emf indicating that the diet based methanogenesis likely contributed to the methane increment in the dm group moreover the relative abundances of lysinibacillus a type of exoelectrogen with conductive pili like appendages li et al 2021 yang et al 2021 increased by 6 50 folds with the presence of emf tab s4 which was likely to exchange electrons with methanogenesis to produce methane unlike the h2 that is reduced in the cytoplasm electrotrophic methanogenesis relies on the respiratory proteins like vhoc in the inner membrane to directly accept electrons from exoelectrogens for further electron transportation borrel et al 2019 microorganisms capable of donating accepting electrons through the respiratory enzymes on cell membranes were enriched with the emf indicating that the respiratory chains on the cell surface were more likely to be affected by emf considering that the cell envelopes including cell membrane and cell walls were circuits to generate the emf with the variation of magnetic flux the emf might affect the respiratory enzymes on the cell envelopes to promote the metabolism and growth of electrotrophic methanogens methanoscrcina and exoelectrogens lysinibacillus 3 3 enhanced electron transfer along respiration chains with emf f420 is the essential co factor that accepts electrons from inner cellular membrane proteins like fpo chadwick et al 2022 of methanogens to generate f420h2 that provides reducing power for co2 reduction the f420h2 f420 ratio of the sediments in the dm group 0 98 was higher increased by 44 12 than that of the control group 0 68 to drive the co2 reduction and methane yield which indicated that the electron donation from the respiratory proteins was more efficient in the conversion of f420 to f420h2 fig 4 and tab s5 similarly the nad nadh ratio of the sediments in the dm group 2 38 was higher increased by 55 56 than that of the control group 1 53 saura and kaila 2019 complex i in bacterial respiration chains accepts electrons from nadh and generate the nad and the depletion of electron acceptors or the stuck electron transfer in respiration chains cause drawbacks for the conversion of nadh to nad hirst 2013 therefore the higher nad nadh ratio in the sediments of the dm group indicated that the respiration chains on the bacterial cell membrane were likely to be more active with the dynamic magnetic field to oxidize nadh the concentration changes of the cofactors f420 and nadh indicated that the emf likely accelerated the electron transfer in the respiration chains of methanogens and bacteria the enzyme activity of respiratory proteins that serve as the reaction centers in respiration chains determines the rates of respiratory reactions and electron transfer as expected the activity of the specific respiration enzymes on respiration chains complex i and complex iii all increased with the dynamic magnetic field tab s3 especially the enzyme activity of complex i in the dm group 0 506 0 28 u was 1 38 folds of the control 0 367 0 10 u and the activity of complex iii in the dm group 0 589 0 35 u increased by 36 compared with control 0 433 0 22 u tab s3 with the presence of emf the increased activity of respiration enzymes accelerated the electron transfer along respiration chains to forward the reduction of f420 or the oxidation of nadh the secretion of respiration enzymes was closely related to cell respiration however the metatranscriptome sequencing test showed that the genes related to the biosynthesis of respiratory enzymes such as nuoc for complex i synthesis and frha for fpo synthesis were not significantly up regulated with the effects of emf alex et al 1990 schimpf et al 2022 therefore the presence of emf did not enhance the secretion of respiratory enzymes by regulating gene transcription and expression however the genes such as ubie and mqnd associated with the biosynthesis of quinones fig 5 were upregulated in the sediments with the dmf tab s6 hiratsuka et al 2008 lee et al 1997 quinones hydroquinones the switchable redox mediators have been extensively reported to shuttle electrons among respiratory enzymes in respiration chains sarewicz and osyczka 2015 the significantly up regulated genes associated with the biosynthesis of quinones might benefit the electron transfer along with respiration chains 3 4 emf induced modification of protein like substances benefited electron transfer in sediment the cv curves showed that the capacitance 1 92 f of the sediments in the dm group increased by 33 33 compared with that of the control group 1 44 f fig 6 the increased capacitance of the sediments meant that more electron storage sites were available for electron exchange among the microorganisms the eis results also showed that the internal resistance of the dm group was lower than the control and the conductivity of the sediments increased from 1164 μs cm to 1258 μs cm with the dynamic magnetic field applied showing the acceleration of electron transfer in the sediments the electro activities such as conductivity and capacitance were commonly used as indicators to evaluate the extracellular respiration in microbial aggregations as is extensively reported electrical stimulations e g directly applying potential or voltage improved the electro activities of microbial communities to promote the electron flowing from exoelectrogens to electrotrophic methanogens jiang et al 2022 wang et al 2020 accordingly the induced emf could act similarly to directly applied electrical stimulations potential or voltage our previous study found that a voltage imposed on the sludge cell caused the polarization of amide groups and the depolarization of n h the protein like substances leading to improved dielectric properties capacitance and accelerated electron transfer conductivity yu and zhang 2019 with the emf the electro induced polarization of respiratory enzymes in the cell membrane might occur to assist electron transfer in respiration chains as well as the sediments to verify this speculation the sediments were further charicterized with electrochemical in situ ftir spectroscopy to detect the responses of functional groups in sediments to electrical signals the testing potentials yu et al 2015 as shown in fig 7 the intensities of c n bands around 1550 cm 1 and c o bands bands around 1650 cm 1 in the amide groups of dmf free sediments control group showed fewer changes and were lower than that of the dm group yu and zhang 2019 indicating that the amide groups of dmf free sediments were inert to the electric signals comparatively for the sediments of the dm group the intensities of c n and c o bands in amide groups showed an obvious increasing trend as the potential shifted from 0 9 v to 0 4 v indicating that c n and c o in amide groups were polarized by the testing potentials the polarity was reported positively associated with the relative permittivity indicating the material s capacitance dubois et al 2004 therefore the polarized amide groups could increase the capacitance of protein like substances in the sediment the polarization of amide groups i e c n and c o in the sediments of the dm group led to the electrons escaping from the nuclear of n and o atoms to be more likely to get engaged in electron transfer meanwhile c n and c o in amide groups were reported to be essential sites for electron transfer in protein like substances niki et al 2003 expressly c o could accept protons or h radicals to form c o h to transport electrons termed proton coupled electron transfer sawicka et al 2010 the polarized amide groups of cell surfaces meant that more electrons in higher energy states could participate in the electron transfer via the proton coupled pattern a d h kinetic isotope effect kie test was conducted to verify the proton coupled electron transfer in the current of the sediment okamoto et al 2017 before adding the heavy water d2o the initial current of the dm group was 1 62 fold of the control fig 8 indicating a higher conductivity of the sediments after the emf treatment after the d2o addition the current of the dm and control groups both decreased continuously in d h kie tests d atoms possess a higher mass than the h atoms when the d atoms in d2o replaced h atoms proton in h2o the proton motion inevitably slowed down to retard the proton coupled electron transfer pcet in the microbial extracellular respiration which manifested as the decrease in current eventually the current of the two groups was maintained at a lower level than that before adding notably the current decrease of the dm group was more obvious than the control it indicated that the development of h coupled electron transfer after the emf treatment accounted for the increased current of the sediments in this study together with the polarized amide groups of the cell surface in ftir results it seemed that the respiratory enzymes were modified with the emf to enhance electron transfer along with respiration chains which might contribute to the improved reaction activity of the respiratory enzymes in cell respiration respiratory enzymes couple the proton motions to the outside of the cell with the electron transfer to form the membrane potential for atp generation hirst 2013 saura and kaila 2019 wu et al 2020 the development of proton coupled electron transfer after emf stimulation potentially increased the proton accumulation outside microbial cells to increase the membrane potential for atp generation to verify the possible changes in membrane potential the sediment aggregation was stained with thioflavin t tht the fluorescent dye that could be absorbed into the inside of cells when the membrane potential increases under a static dynamic magnetic field liu et al 2015 prindle et al 2015 from the results of fluorescent images fig 9 when applying a static magnetic field 0 3 mt the membrane potential of the sediment aggregations showed little changes that ranged from 7 10 1 95 to 10 32 1 73 and was maintained at a relatively stable fluorescence intensity level of 8 01 1 19 when applying a dynamic magnetic field 0 2 0 4 mt the fluorescence intensities of the sediment aggregations increased to a higher level 13 72 2 11 and showed apparent fluctuations ranging from 8 35 2 42 to 17 79 2 43 the increased fluorescence intensity of the sediment aggregations represented the hyperpolarization of the bacterial cells which was caused by the increased membrane potential to cellular internalization of tht tht has been widely used as a fluorescent cationic dye to identify the membrane potential prindle et al 2015 microbial cells with the inside negative electrical membrane potential could retain tht in cells as the tht is positively charged the membrane potential of microbial cells is more negative the more tht could be retained therefore the accelerated pcet of respiratory enzymes could induce more proton outflow to make the membrane potential more negative in the cell respiration of bacteria and methanogens the outflow of h ions accompanied by electron transfer increased membrane potential and formed the h gradient proton motive force pmf and atp could be generated accompanied by the inflow of h irons to convert the pmf to chemical energy courbon and rubinstein 2022 therefore the higher and markedly varied membrane potential with the emf was likely the result of the enhanced proton coupled electron transfer that occurred in the respiratory enzymes with emf figs 7 and 8 which benefited the atp synthesis as well as the growth of exoelectrogens and electrotrophic methanogens that exchanged electrons via their respiration chains 3 5 implications electrochemical strategies e g bio electrochemical systems have been extensively reported to promote the methane production of anaerobic systems wang et al 2022b zhao et al 2016 however the electro driven methanation has been reported to account for a quite low proportion of the methane increment jiang et al 2022 zakaria and ranjan dhar 2021 the electro induced improvement in the electro activities such as the conductivity and capacitance of microbial aggregations could accelerate the electron transfer among microorganisms to promote the diet based methanogenesis which contributed to the majority of the methane increment with electrical stimulation as expected the emf induced by the relative motion between microorganisms and the magnetic field could play a similar role as the electrical stimulations in bio electrochemical systems apart from the enrichment of exoelectrogens and electrotrophic methanogens amide groups of protein like substances were polarized with the emf considering that c o bonds in amide groups provide the hydrogen bond skeleton of protein secondary structures like α helix pauling and corey 1950 the secondary structures of protein complexes may change with the polarization of c o bonds in amide groups to accelerate the electron transfer coupled with proton motions in proteins chen et al 2010 the coupling of proton and electron transport was a basic form for respiratory enzymes to increase the membrane potential and generate atps fig 10 with the emf a significantly higher potential was observed to benefit the atp generation which indicated that the emf could strengthen the proton coupled electron transfer in respiratory enzymes protein like substances to increase methane production as the applications of telecommunications and power facilities rise the bioelectromagnetic effects of electromagnetic pollution have raised concerns about the potential harm to organism health however the potential impact of electromagnetic pollution on microbial metabolism has long been neglected this study was the first time to reveal that the electromagnetic field could increase the methane emission from sediments it indicated that in the area around magnetic veins submarine cables electric stations et al the variations of the magnetic field induced by the changed electromagnetic waves or runoffs tide might induce emf to aggravate methane emission which could arise nonneglected impacts on global climate meanwhile sediments in the coast and soil are widespread hot spots for biogeochemical interactions hydrological activities like tides zhao et al 2022 as well as the photosynthesis of plants dai et al 2022 bring about intermittent redox turnover in coast and soil which enable microorganisms in sediments to produce reactive oxygen species ros during the microbial respiration applying a dynamic magnetic field promoted microbial respiration in sediments which may help the oxidation of pollutants by accelerating the production of respiration based ross 4 conclusion in summary the study presented here showed that with a dynamic magnetic field the induced emf could increase the methane emission of sediments by 41 71 as an electrical stimulation the emf caused the polarization of amide groups in protein like substances which increased the electro activities of the sediments to promote the electron exchange between exoelectrogens and electrotrophic methanogens notably the polarized respiratory enzymes strengthened the proton motions outflow coupled with electron transfer providing more redox driving force for methane production and higher membrane potential for atp generation the results revealed that the relative motions between sediments and magnets could increase methane production along with the ever increasing exposure to magnetic substances and the intensifying electromagnetic pollution the methane increment caused by electromagnetic induction should cause alarm for it might bring about a nonnegligible threat to the global climate credit authorship

14726,wastewater based epidemiology wbe approach provides objective quantitative near real time profiles of illicit drug consumption by monitoring the concentration of unchanged parent drugs or their metabolites entering the municipal sewage system valencia is the third most populous city in spain an important country for the use and transit of several of these drugs estimations of consumption over long periods of time will help get better understanding of spatial and temporal trends in the use of licit and illicit drugs accordingly applying the best practice protocol 16 drugs of abuse and metabolites were monitored in this study and 8 were daily measured during one two weeks between 2011 and 2020 at the inlet of three wastewater treatment plants of valencia city analysis of the selected compounds was performed by liquid chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometry and the concentrations obtained were used to back calculate the consumption data cannabis tobacco and cocaine were the most consumed drugs whereas opioids were less used cannabis and cocaine consumption are on average 2 7 23 4 and 1 1 2 3 g day 1000inh respectively and their use tended to increase since 2018 weekly profiles were characterized by higher consumption of cocaine ecstasy and heroin during weekends compared to weekdays similarly during las fallas main local festivity increased use of

1 introduction wastewater based epidemiology wbe provides objective quantitative near real time profiles of illicit and licit drug local consumption by monitoring the concentration of unchanged parent drugs or their metabolites entering the municipal sewage system bijlsma et al 2021 gonzález mariño et al 2020 lorenzo and picó 2019 mercan et al 2019 vitale et al 2021 these concentrations in the influent of wastewater treatment plants wwtps are used to back calculate the mass loads of the parent drugs and or metabolites and finally to estimate the consumption g day or doses day according to the drug metabolism and excretion patterns additionally with the population served by the wwtp and the standard dose in which drugs are consumed the results can be normalized to g day 1000 inhabitants or doses day 1000 inhabitants and then used to make comparisons among locations gonzález mariño et al 2020 mercan et al 2019 estimation of wbe has become complementary to general population surveys on drug of abuse consumption sales data medical records drug seizures etc bijlsma et al 2021 emcdda 2021 ort et al 2014 it is considered a suitable alternative to estimate objectively licit and illicit drugs consumption avoiding problems such as the lack of objectivity of the information collected from population surveys not all consumers would report it the late response time of these surveys long implementation periods and their significantly higher cost as well as their uneven spatial resolution not granting realistic drugs use estimation at regional scales the different socioeconomic and cultural factors defining consumers habits and trends are not well represented castiglioni et al 2013 mastroianni et al 2017 van nuijs et al 2011a currently wbe is used by an increasing number of researchers to calculate the intake of a large variety of illicit drugs in cities from a number of european countries as in belgium van nuijs et al 2011b france nefau et al 2013 spain andrés costa et al 2014 bijlsma et al 2021 estévez danta et al 2022 mastroianni et al 2017 germany and switzerland been et al 2016 italy zuccato et al 2016 finland kankaanpää et al 2016 lithuania boogaerts et al 2021 or slovakia mackuľak et al 2014 as well as in other countries all over the world as in china du et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 zheng et al 2021 south korea kim et al 2015 south africa archer et al 2018 australia lai et al 2016 colombia bijlsma et al 2016 costa rica causanilles et al 2017b brazil da silva et al 2018 or the united states bishop et al 2020 skees et al 2018 special mention to the studies compiling results of several cities to present estimates at higher scales as those made for spain 13 cities bijlsma et al 2021 europe 12 cities thomas et al 2012 van nuijs et al 2011a and even at global level 120 cities in 37 countries gonzález mariño et al 2020 furthermore wbe is also very helpful to identify changes during special events i e festivals sporting events or holiday periods to monitor variations in drugs use through time and to recognize new habits or the emergence of new illicit drugs as the new psychoactive substances andrés costa et al 2017 bijlsma et al 2021 gonzález mariño et al 2018 because of its increasing use wbe is a methodology in continuous improvement causanilles et al 2017a choi et al 2018 mercan et al 2019 vitale et al 2021 the analytical procedures for the determination of the compounds usually performed by solid phase extraction fontanals et al 2019 followed by high specific and sensitive determination techniques such as liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms have reached great robustness and excellent sensitivity and selectivity by using triple quadrupole qqq or quadrupole linear ion trap qtrap analysers bijlsma et al 2012 gonzález mariño et al 2018 mastroianni et al 2017 moreover less used high resolution mass spectrometry with time of flight or orbitrap analysers has proved outstanding performance for qualitative and quantitative analysis of illicit drugs and their metabolites andrés costa et al 2017 bijlsma et al 2012 gonzález mariño et al 2012 great progress has also been achieved in the back calculations that transform measured concentrations in wastewater into an amount of used illicit drugs particularly in relation to the homogenization of correction factors cfs derived from the excretion and in sewer degradation of each drug and the dose used castiglioni et al 2013 du et al 2015 gracia lor et al 2016 postigo et al 2011 thai et al 2016 other factors creating uncertainty in the results of drug consumption have also been investigated and homogenized i e sampling strategies assessment of population size to propose some best practice requirements for each of the steps in estimating community drug use in order to improve the reliability of such estimates castiglioni et al 2013 rico et al 2017 score 2020 consequently wbe has been endorsed since 2008 by the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction emcdda and since 2016 by the united nations office on drugs and crime unodc both including the wbe results provided by the sewage analysis core group europe network score score 2020 in their annual drug reports bijlsma et al 2021 in spain national score members have created the esar net network esar net 2020 to support the wbe results and communicate them to authorities and policymakers according to the reports of the emcdda spain is an important country of transit of several illicit drugs such as cannabis and cocaine due to its cultural linguistic and colonial ties to latin america and its proximity to morocco bijlsma et al 2021 and the quantity of seized ones and the prevalence of their use rank spain at the top of europe emcdda 2021 valencia is the third most populous city in spain with 1 2 million inhabitants including its metropolitan area sadutto et al 2021 behind madrid and barcelona and estimations of drug consumption over long periods of time will help get better understanding of spatial and temporal differences and trends in use of illicit drugs by means of the wbe approach this study aims to i estimate the consumption of 16 licit and illicit drugs in valencia spain during 10 consecutive years although only 8 were actually determined annually ii compare valencia s wbe consumption estimates with those of other cities iii establish temporal weekly patterns of drug use in the city between 2011 and 2020 and iv assess the impact of the main local festivity las fallas in the estimated drugs average consumption tendencies to do this 16 compounds including several licit and illicit drugs cocaine cannabis tobacco opiates and amphetamine type stimulants and their metabolites were daily

samples were collected from the influent of three different wwtps in valencia pinedo 1 pinedo 2 and quart benager receiving wastewater from valencia and other small surrounding towns the catchment area of pinedo 1 p1 and pinedo 2 p2 consists of about 351 000 and 943 000 inhabitants respectively while the catchment area of quart benager qb consists of 215 000 inhabitants the main characteristics of each wwtp are summarized in table s1 supplementary information sampling campaigns were carried out during 10 years thus 2011 march 10th to 16th 2012 april 17th to may 1st 2013 march 6th to 12th

prevent degradation of the compounds to be analysed 2 3 sample preparation iss were added to the samples 250 ml which were then vacuum filtered using 0 60 µm glass fiber filter ga 55 90 mm purchased from advantec mfs dublin usa before solid phase extraction procedure for the latter cartridges were previously conditioned with 6 ml methanol and 6 ml of elix milli q water illicit drugs were extracted using polymeric reversed phase cartridges and a 12 port vacuum manifold supelco visiprep 57 030 u of sigma aldrich st louis mo eeuu samples without ph adjustment were passed through the cartridges under vacuum at a flow rate of 10 ml min after that the cartridges were washed with 6 ml of elix milli q water and dried under vacuum for 15 min analytes were eluted with 6 ml of methanol evaporated to dryness at 40 c using a combined sample concentrator model sbhconc 1 and a heating plate model sbh130d 3 by stuart stafford uk dissolved in 1 ml of water methanol 90 10 v v and then stored in 2 ml amber glass vials ready for analysis 2 4 uhplc qqq ms ms chromatographic separation was performed using an agilent 1260 uhplc agilent waldbronn germany the separation was carried out with a phenomenex kinetex c18 1 7 µm 100 a 50 2 10 mm at temperature of 25 ºc and constant flow rate of 0 2 ml min the mobile phase was eluent a formic acid 0 1 in water and eluent b formic acid 0 1 in methanol the gradient elution was started at 10 b maintained for 5 min then increased linearly to 95 b in 12 min and remained constant at 95 b up to 25 min then it returns to the initial conditions with an equilibrium time of 15 min the injection volume was 5 ml the injection was long to use a flow compatible with ms detection the uhplc was coupled to an agilent 6410 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with an electrospray ionization source mode 300 ºc gas temperature 11 l min gas flow and 25 psi nebulizer the optimal quantification and confirmation transitions as well as the specific ms parameters were optimized for each compound table s2 2 5 quality control limits of quantification loqs recovery precision and matrix effects are outlined in table s3 the linearity was also evaluated by injecting in triplicate 5 concentration levels from 10 to 500 ng l using is calibration to avoid errors due to matrix effect the combination of such matrix effect and extraction efficiency was estimated from the iss which were spiked at the same concentration into all samples the lowest concentration used in the calibration curve is close to the loqs from 1 1 to 7 8 ng l for practical reasons to the common laboratory routine it was much easier to select a value slightly over the loqs calibration curves were linear with correlation coefficient r2 0 99 for all compounds extraction recoveries were evaluated in quintuplicated by spiking aliquots of deionized water with the analytes at the loq and at 500 ng l of each analyte and of influent wastewater at 100 and 500 ng l in the latter as all analytes were in the sample five aliquots of a sample with low concentrations were spiked at each concentration and other five aliquots of this sample were measured without analytes spike then the spiked samples after non spiked sample signal subtraction were compared to the calibration curve recoveries were 65 126 in deionized water and 78 122 in influent wastewater the repeatability and reproducibility between days of five samples spiked at 100 and 500 ng l in both types of matrix expressed as relative standard deviation rsd were lower than 26 and 20 respectively table s3 2 6 estimation of collective drug use drugs loads to wwtps eq 1 and consumptions eq 2 were back calculated from the measured daily concentration of the drug target according to the following equations andrés costa et al 2014 mastroianni et al 2017 1 l mg day c ng l fr l day 1 0 6 mg ng 2 q mg day 1000 inh l mg day cf 1000 ninh where l is the drug s load to the wwtp c is its concentration fr is the daily flow rate of each wwtp q is the drug s consumption cf is the correction factor that takes into account the molar mass ratio between the parent drug and the drug residue as well as the percentage of metabolic excretion for detailed values see castiglioni et al 2013 du et al 2015 gracia lor et al 2016 postigo et al 2011 thai et al 2016 and table s4 and ninh is the number of inhabitants served by the wwtp estimated by means of the biological oxygen demand bod of each sampled day van nuijs et al 2011b finally it is important to mention that in order to minimize the uncertainty related to wbe estimates we have adopted and strictly followed in this study the best practice requirements for each of the steps proposed castiglioni et al 2013 score 2020 2 7 statistical analysis normality of the data was tested using shapiro wilk s test n 50 and homogeneity of variances by means of levene s test for the parametric analysis differences in drug s concentrations and consumptions between years days and wwtps were established through one way anova for non parametric analysis differences were determined by the tests of mann whitney u m w or kruskal wallis k w in all the cases results were considered to be statistically significant at p 0 05 all statistical analyses were carried out using ibm spss statistics 27 3 results 3 1 occurrence of drugs in samples of valencia wastewaters the frequency mean minimum and maximum concentrations of the licit and illicit drugs and or metabolites screened in this study are summarized in tables s5 and s6 the former presents the results of the compounds analysed yearly from 2011 to 2020 amp becg coc ket mamp mdma mor thccooh whereas the latter shows the results of the other analytes buf cocet cod coti ecme eddp eta meth which were analysed in different years mainly 2014 2017 in general all the screened compounds were present in all the samples analysed with frequencies higher than 80 only ket 40 and cocet 42 showed lower occurrences mean concentration values in ng l measured each year were high for the metabolites of cocaine becg 1127 9 3132 0 and of nicotine coti 1105 8 3012 4 these are followed by coc 192 1 1238 2 cod 185 4 1202 0 the cannabinoid thccooh 63 6 593 2 and other cocaine metabolites as ecme 35 5 528 6 and cocet 11 7 112 4 opioids showed low concentrations as mor 25 5 201 1 eddp 91 3 92 4 and meth 13 0 48 8 which were on the same range than amphetamine type stimulants amp 28 9 77 1 mdma 13 1 84 5 ket 7 1 37 2 and mamp 3 5 48 1 similarly to other drugs as buf 11 5 56 6 and eta 6 4 19 5 fig s1 according to these concentrations there are some significant differences in their patterns between the three wwtps considered for valencia city and its surrounding towns averaging the whole study period the concentration of thccooh and coti were similar among wwtps p 0 05 although the former tended to be higher in p1 and the latter in qb on the other hand the concentrations of coc and all its metabolites becg cocet and ecme were significantly different p 0 05 being higher in qb than in p1 and p2 qb p1 p2 in relation to amphetamine type stimulants significant differences p 0 05 were found on the concentrations of amp mdma p1 p2 qb and mamp p1 p2 qb whereas those of ket tended to be higher in p1 and qb than in p2 p 0 05 for the opioids mor concentrations tended to be higher in qb p 0 05 eddp levels followed the trend p1 p2 qb p 0 05 meth tended to be higher in p1 and p2 than in qb and cod tended to be higher in p2 and qb than in p1 p 0 05 based on the flows of each wwtp and the analytes concentrations found in them loads in g day of these substances arriving to valencia s wwtps were calculated tables s7 and s8 mean values were becg 121 5 288 4 coc 20 8 169 5 ecme 3 9 69

as coti 117 5 333 3 and cod 23 3 132 2 the opioids eddp 9 8 11 3 and meth 0 5 7 5 as well as buf 1 5 8 3 and eta 0 8 2 1 were in similar ranges but it should be kept in mind that these analytes were measured during shorter periods in general the highest loads were observed in p2 followed by those of p1 and qb which are directly related to their flows 3 2 estimation of drugs consumption in valencia city according to the results obtained tables 1 and 2 mean consumption of licit and illicit drugs in mg day 1000inh in valencia was high for cannabis 2748 9 23351 0 and tobacco as nicotine 1893 3 5486 0 followed by cocaine calculated through becg 1126 4 2258 3 coc 553 6 4097 6 cocet 459 5 4649 1 or ecme 37 3 465 9 then codeine 180 5 1046 3 bufotenine 93 8 343 0 and amphetamine type stimulants as mdma 15 4 102 5 amp 23 1 66 8 and mamp 3 7 50 6 heroin calculated by means of morphine 21 1 164 3 showed low consumption followed by ketamine 7 9 48 9 methadone as eddp 21 0 37 9 or meth 13 8 41 7 and finally etamine 4 1 15 8 despite the fact that consumption calculations are directly related to the wwtps flows p2 p1 qb some trends can also be observed when they are compared averaging the whole study period the consumption of cannabis was significantly different between wwtps p 0 05 with p1 p2 qb tobacco use tended to be higher in p2 than in qb and p1 p 0 05 on the other hand cocaine use tended to be higher in qb when calculated with becg or cocet p 0 05 in p1 and p2 when with coc p 0 05 and in p1 and qb when using ecme p 0 05 amphetamine type stimulants consumption showed significant differences among wwtps p 0 05 with amphetamine p1 p2 qb methamphetamine ecstasy and ketamine p1 p2 qb in relation to opioids heroin and codeine consumption tended to be higher in p1 and p2 than in qb p 0 05 whereas methadone presented significant differences p 0 05 when calculated with both eddp and meth p1 p2 qb 3 3 temporal trends of drugs consumption and influence of local festivities mean consumptions of selected illicit drugs were relatively homogenous throughout the studied period with significant higher values in different years tables 1 and 2 worth mentioning are the higher values calculated in 2011 and 2012 for mamp 90 7 and 60 6 mg day 1000inh respectively p 0 05 general tendencies cannot be established for the whole study period although it can be stated that some increasing trends were observed in the last years since 2018 with significantly higher consumption values calculated in 2019 for cannabis particularly in p2 62107 8 mg day 1000inh and for cocaine 7083 5 mg day 1000inh heroin 446 6 mg day 1000inh and ketamine 146 0 mg day 1000inh in qb weekly consumption profiles of the different drugs are presented in fig 2 as the addition of the average daily use mg day 1000inh calculated in each wwtp three drugs cocaine heroin and ecstasy showed a weekly trend with significantly higher consumption values during the weekend compared to the weekdays p 0 05 while cocaine was more used from thursday to sunday heroin and mdma were from friday to sunday in fig 2 these consumptions correspond to the values presented the day after as the samples were collected from 8 30 am of the day before to 8 30 am of the day of sampling this is the value of friday corresponds to the consumption of thursday as for cocaine consumption weekend estimates averaged 5912 9 mg day 1000inh which is significantly higher p 0 05 than the value of weekdays 4192 8 mg day 1000inh ecstasy s consumption during weekends was also significantly higher p 0 05 during the weekend 157 7 mg day 1000inh than in week days 104 6 mg day 1000inh on the other hand similar weekly consumptions were assessed for tobacco amphetamine methamphetamine ketamine codeine and cannabis in relation to the consumption of drugs during special events a local festivity called las fallas was monitored in 2014 this festivity starts the 15th march and finishes the 19th march of every year having this in mind consumptions calculated between the 16th and the 20th of march were compared with those of the days before observing a significant increase p 0 05 in the consumption of cocaine and amphetamine type stimulants mainly mdma amphetamine and methamphetamine fig 3 the highest consumption growth was detected for the mdma which passed from 80 8 to 335 8 mg day 1000inh cocaine consumption was also almost doubled during las fallas compared to previous days as proved the values calculated using becg 5972 1 vs 3592 7 mg day 1000inh coc 7046 0 vs 4897 8 mg day 1000inh and cocet 4519 6 vs 2357 8 mg day 1000inh amphetamine and methamphetamine consumption were also increased from 90 8 mg day 1000inh before festivity to 168 2 mg day 1000inh during festivity and from 13 2 to 29 2 mg day 1000inh respectively 4 discussion 4 1 occurrence of drugs in samples of valencia wastewaters according to the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction emcdda around 83 million or 28 9 of adults aged 15 64 in the eu are estimated to have used illicit drugs at least once in their lifetime in 2020 about 17 4 million young adults 15 34 used drugs in the last year 16 9 emcdda 2021 although these data should be regarded as a minimum estimate due to possible reporting biases they highlight the relevance of the problem of illicit drug s use in eu not only for the health but also for the safety and wellbeing of its citizens results of this study confirmed the elevated use of licit and illicit drugs in valencia city and surrounding towns tables s5 and s6 despite the fact that some spatial trends could be found among the levels found in the different wwtps p1 showed higher concentrations of thccooh all the amphetamine like stimulants eddp and meth p2 of cod whereas qb presented higher concentrations of coti coc and its metabolites and mor these will be discussed as averages for all the study area cocaine coc and the metabolite benzoylecgonine becg were the compounds more frequently detected and at higher concentrations reaching the µg l in the wastewater samples of valencia city and surrounding towns tables s5 and s6 similar pattern and concentrations were found in different cities of spain bijlsma et al 2021 estévez danta et al 2022 confirming previous data of barcelona mastroianni et al 2017 and different cities of france nefau et al 2013 they were higher than those of slovakia finland and lithuania boogaerts et al 2021 kankaanpää et al 2016 mackuľak et al 2014 high frequencies but low concentrations were reported in the usa bishop et al 2020 skees et al 2018 comparable becg frequencies and concentrations were also found in colombia bijlsma et al 2016 and of coc in costa rica andrés costa et al 2017 in other regions as guangzhou china coc was not found in any sample and although becg was quantified in 85 of samples its concentration was very low zhang et al 2019 cocaethylene cocet another metabolite of cocaine also showed high concentrations tens hundreds ng l as in brazil da silva et al 2018 but it was found in less of the half of samples analysed in 2014 2017 the 2021 european drug report identified cocaine as the second most prevalent and second most frequently seized illicit stimulant in europe emcdda 2021 and the 2021 report of the spanish observatory on drugs and addictions oeda confirmed cocaine as one of the drugs with the highest use prevalence 2 5 among the spanish population 15 64 in 2019 2020 oeda 2021 in general higher concentrations of becg than of coc and ecme were measured in the three wwtp considered which is expected since becg excretion percentage after cocaine consumption is higher leading to concentrations superior to those of coc archer et al 2018 da silva et al 2018 nefau et al 2013 becg is considered more stable no loss of analyte in sewage up to 72 h at 4 c and up to 12 h at 20 c conditions respected in this study and because coc can partially degrade hydrolysis to becg in blood and urine castiglioni et al 2013 additionally coc and ecme are less stable in sewage and becg could increase by as much as 20 over 24 h at 4 c because of their biodegradation castiglioni et al 2013 van nuijs et al 2011b to check for excessive biotransformation of coc to becg the coc becg ratio has been calculated based on their molar mass relation and on the excretion rate limits as unchanged coc and as becg cut off values of 0 75 and 0 27 have been used bijlsma et al 2012 the ratios obtained in this study are between these two values with some higher values similarly to other studies andrés costa et al 2017 castiglioni et al 2013 mastroianni et al 2017 thai et al 2016 suggesting other likely sources of coc to wastewater related to deliberate or accidental disposal of the drug into the sewer andrés costa et al 2014 or to other routes of consumption despite nicotine metabolite measured coti was only analysed in the period 2014 2017 their high concentrations in the range of µg l agree with the trends reported in a recent publication estévez danta et al 2022 according to which the recreational drugs with the highest use prevalence among the spanish population 15 64 are alcohol 63 and tobacco 32 oeda 2021 in this study besides cocaine cannabis was among the illicit drugs most frequently detected in wastewater samples based on data from 26 countries that undertook a survey between 2015 and 2020 last year cannabis use among eu inhabitants 15 34 is estimated at 15 4 and general population surveys indicate around 1 8 of adults 15 64 in the eu are daily or almost daily cannabis users emcdda 2021 with 37 5 of the spanish population within this age that has ever used cannabis 10 5 in 2020 and a consumption prevalence in the last month of 8 oeda 2021 cannabis active principle ingredient is δ9 tetrahydrocannabinol δ9 thc but its high metabolization leads to a very low excretion rate making thccooh or 11 oh thc the metabolites to be used for thc back calculation the former is preferred since it is a relatively stable biotransformation product in wastewater and because 11 oh thc is rapidly oxidized to thccooh andrés costa et al 2017 gracia lor et al 2016 these data help to explain the ubiquity of thccooh in the wastewater samples analysed similarly to other studies bijlsma et al 2021 nefau et al 2013 zuccato et al 2016 additionally cannabis resin sold in europe is now more potent than before 20 28 more thc and there are high thc content products and new forms of cannabis on the illicit market as well as a bunch of products containing cannabis extracts sold commercially emcdda 2021 which can also be responsible of the high concentration values of the samples table s5 in the range of tens hundreds of ng l as reported in several cities of spain bijlsma et al 2021 estévez danta et al 2022 mastroianni et al 2017 slovakia mackuľak et al 2014 colombia bijlsma et al 2016 costa rica andrés costa et al 2017 usa skees et al 2018 but lower than those found in some cities of france nefau et al 2013 amphetamine like stimulants amp mamp ket and mdma can be considered as a third group of the illicit drugs more generally detected in valencia city and surrounding towns wastewater according to the 2021 european drug report amphetamine is the europe s second most consumed stimulant drug after cocaine surveys from 25 countries 2015 2020 suggested that 1 4 million young adults 15 34 used amphetamine during the last year 1 4 of this age group which would confirm the frequencies found in this study similar to those of barcelona mastroianni et al 2017 but higher than those in france nefau et al 2013 italy zuccato et al 2016 and even in china du et al 2015 seizures data also confirmed this trend since in 2019 eu member states reported 34000 seizures of amphetamine amounting to 17 0 tonnes t and 10000 of methamphetamine 2 9 t of which 1 6 t were seized in spain originating in mexico in relation to the high concentrations found in samples besides the high number of users these could be related to the increasing average purities reported in the eu 13 67 for amphetamine and 16 94 for methamphetamine in 2019 emcdda 2021 even though these concentrations are lower than those reported in other continents as north america skees et al 2018 average amp concentrations in valencian wwtps samples were higher than those of mamp table s5 in addition to a possible higher number of users and despite being considered generally stable no loss of analyte in sewage in line with stability studies in urine at 37 c for 3 days and longer castiglioni et al 2013 there is approximately 4 7 of mamp that is excreted as amp gonzález mariño et al 2020 besides amp and mamp can be directly disposed into sewer systems there can also be a part derived from high prescribed use of amp in therapeutic drugs as amphetaminil benzphetamine clobenzorex dimethylamphetamine ethylamphetamine famprofazone fencamine mefenorex prenylamine selegiline etc an amount of drug that needs to be differentiated from that one consumed and excreted e g by chiral chromatography and fingerprint analyses archer et al 2018 bijlsma et al 2021 but that is not corrected here their prescription rates in europe indicate that any contribution would generally be 1 of the total amp amounts ort et al 2014 thomas et al 2012 amp and mamp concentrations in valencia tens of ng l were slightly lower than in barcelona mastroianni et al 2017 or cities in france slovakia and finland kankaanpää et al 2016 mackuľak et al 2014 nefau et al 2013 and usa bishop et al 2020 skees et al 2018 hundreds of ng l in the study of bijlsma et al bijlsma et al 2021 considering 17 cities in spain including valencia amp and mamp s concentrations of barcelona and bilbao were in the same range but those of castellon guadalajara lleida or toledo were lower or not detected results obtained in different cities of china presented contrasted results in a southern city amp concentrations were lower but mamp were similar zheng et al 2021 while in guangzhou and other cities of china those of amp were similar while those of mamp were higher du et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 according to gracia lor et al gracia lor et al 2016 the unchanged mdma and two of its metabolites hmma 4 hydroxy 3 methoxymethamphetamine and hhma 3 4 dihydroxy methampheta mine can be considered for back calculation in wbe studies however these authors also state that without actual data is difficult to predict if these conjugates will be fully reverted to the parent compound in sewage and consequently the unchanged mdma is advised to be measured europe remains an important source of mdma products that supply the global market surveys from 26 eu countries 2015 2020 suggest that 2 million young adults 15 34 used ecstasy in the last year 1 9 of this age group emcdda 2021 and 5 of the spanish population 15 64 has ever used it oeda 2021 high frequencies of mdma detection in the samples analysed table s5 are also supported by the increasing number of seizures of mdma powder in the eu 0 3 t in 2016 to 2 2 t in 2018 and 2019 corresponding to 4 6 million mdma tablets additionally the high concentrations found here could be related to the 149 average increased quantity of mdma in tablets measured since 2009 118 210 mg mdma tablet in 2019 based on data of the emcdda s 2021 report emcdda 2021 concentrations of mdma tens of ng l in valencia were similar to those of slovakia mackuľak et al 2014 colombia less frequent bijlsma et al 2016 several other cities of spain as bilbao castellon palma de mallorca or santiago de compostela bijlsma et al 2021 estévez danta et al 2022 but slightly lower than in barcelona mastroianni et al 2017 or in france and finland kankaanpää et al 2016 nefau et al 2013 hundreds of ng l mdma s concentrations in valencia were higher than the reported in cities of china zhang et al 2019 zheng et al 2021 ketamine is drug available in europe but it is poorly monitored and information on its use and impact on public health is limited emcdda 2021 according to the emcdda 250 600 kg of ketamine seizures were reported by at least 16 eu countries an amount considerably lower compared to those of other amphetamine like stimulants which explain the low frequencies and concentrations detected here ket concentrations in valencia tens of ng l were similar to the levels reported in other spanish bijlsma et al 2021 and colombian cities bijlsma et al 2016 it was ubiquitous in samples of different cities in china and at higher concentrations than those reported here du et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 zheng et al 2021 concentration of opioids in valencia were expected to be low according to 2021 report of the oeda 0 7 of the spanish population 15 64 has used heroin at some time and only 0 1 in the last year an use that has stabilized since the mid 1990s oeda 2021 in the eu the problems with this drug can be higher based on the 26000 heroin and other opioids seizures 7 9 t average purity of heroin 11 51 reported in 2019 with 1 million high risk opioid users emcdda 2021 despite codeine was only analysed in the period 2014 2017 their high concentrations in the range of µg l confirmed opioid analgesics as codeine and tramadol as the drugs with highest prevalence use among the population 15 64 oeda 2021 their concentrations are higher than those reported in a community in the midwestern united states skees et al 2018 codeine is reported to be stable in wastewater but it is rarely analysed and even less information is found for bufotenine and etamine which levels tens of ng l makes suspect their relative low consumption in valencia cod presented high frequencies and concentrations in this study which were higher than those reported in costa rica hundreds of ng l andrés costa et al 2017 or in guangzhou china ng l zhang et al 2019 in this study heroin is back calculated using mor concentrations since it is considered as the most abundant metabolite of heroin nevertheless it is also an indicator of the use of therapeutic morphine codeine ethylmorphine pholcodine and nicomorphine which concentrations should be differentiated from that one of mor but they are not corrected here since it is advised only for countries where the licit contributions of morphine can be higher than those of illicit heroin khan and nicell 2011 gracia lor et al 2016 concentrations measured in valencia hundreds of ng l were similar to the values detected in france nefau et al 2013 but higher than in costa rica or usa tens of ng l andrés costa et al 2017 skees et al 2018 and china zheng et al 2021 on the other hand for methadone its parent compound meth and its metabolite eddp were used here despite meth and eddp were not measured all years their levels were similar tens of ng l and alike to those reported in several cities of france nefau et al 2013 and of usa bishop et al 2020 skees et al 2018 but higher than in china ng l zheng et al 2021 in order to check for possible transformation of meth to eddp the meth eddp ratio has been calculated obtaining values between 0 2 and 1 2 in the range of other studies castiglioni et al 2013 mastroianni et al 2017 thai et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 which suggested deliberate or accidental disposal of the drug into the sewer 4 2 estimation of drugs consumption in valencia city as it was stated despite the fact that wwtps flows follow the trend p2 p1 qb there are important differences between the population they serve only tobacco consumption tended to be higher in p2 than in qb and p1 for cannabis cocaine estimated through coc or ecme all amphetamine type stimulants and opioids the trend was p1 p2 qb cocaine calculated by means of becg or the cocet concentrations tended to higher in qb it can be stated that the consumption of most of the drugs analysed in this study was higher for the population served by p1 this can be explained because this wwtp only treats water from valencia city which is the capital of the community and the third largest city in spain with many leisure places and night life on the other hand p2 and qb treat in addition to part of the wastewater of valencia city that of several surrounding towns and their industrial areas and despite being known for their bars and discos their activity can be considered less intense in valencia the most consumed drugs according to our wbe analysis were cannabis tobacco and cocaine fig 1 although we only measured nicotine s metabolite from 2014 to 2017 the 2021 report of the spanish observatory on drugs and addictions oeda confirmed these three as the drugs with the highest use prevalence among the spanish population 15 64 in the last year here they were followed by codeine in 2014 2017 and amphetamine type stimulants as mdma amp and mamp heroin showed low consumption as well as ketamine methadone and etamine tables 1 and 2 in a previous study andres costa et al andrés costa et al 2014 have proven that cannabis and cocaine were the most consumed drugs in valencia in agreement with results of wbe studies in other spanish cities as barcelona mastroianni et al 2017 and western european countries as italy zuccato et al 2016 and france methadone was also high nefau et al 2013 similarly in these studies amphetamine methamphetamine and ecstasy were reported as a second group of illicit drugs with lower consumptions whereas opioids heroin and or methadone were the less consumed ones 4 2 1 cannabis and tobacco cannabis consumption in valencia table 2 was comparable to other spanish cities e g madrid and bilbao bijlsma et al 2021 table s9 but lower than in barcelona mastroianni et al 2017 which continuously increased since 2012 becoming almost three times higher in four years and the highest in spain bijlsma et al 2021 in 2019 eu member states reported 326000 seizures of cannabis resin amounting to 465 t and 313000 seizures of herbal cannabis amounting to 148 t emcdda 2021 which confirm the very high amount of cannabis moving across the eu its use in valencia is higher than in other european cities as those from italy zuccato et al 2016 france nefau et al 2013 germany and switzerland been et al 2016 and slovakia mackuľak et al 2014 but lower than in netherlands and particularly than amsterdam one of the highest cannabis consumption in europe ort et al 2014 score 2020 thomas et al 2012 in contrast to the other studied drugs no clear geographical patterns have been observed for cannabis use in the different european cities with similar values in smaller towns than in larger cities in a wider analysis cannabis consumption in valencia was higher than in different cities of colombia bijlsma et al 2016 and costa rica andrés costa et al 2017 but similar to the one reported in a community in the midwestern united states skees et al 2018 despite the highest use prevalence of tobacco among the european population it should be highlighted that very few wbe studies focussed on its consumption have been published results of a study performed in four cities of spain bilbao vitoria gasteiz castellon and santiago de compostela and two of portugal porto and vila do conde reported similar tobacco consumption to valencia estévez danta et al 2022 on the other hand the consumption of nicotine performed in lithuania was estimated by using the metabolites cot cot oh and comparison with data calculated in this study is not straightforward boogaerts et al 2021 4 2 2 cocaine in this study significant differences in the estimated cocaine consumption were found depending on the use of the parent compound or its metabolites thus by using coc the results were significantly higher than those of becg cocet and ecme p 0 05 this result is not in agreement with those of colombia and costa rica where the cocaine consumption showed differences becg coc andrés costa et al 2017 bijlsma et al 2016 or in brussels van nuijs et al 2011b where it was the same becg ecme supporting the idea of deliberate or accidental disposal of the drug into valencia s sewer stated above in general studies reporting all cocaine metabolites concentrations finally select becg for calculation because of its higher stability compared to other cocaine residues andrés costa et al 2017 da silva et al 2018 mackuľak et al 2014 nefau et al 2013 table s9 cocaine consumption calculated from becg concentration in valencia was similar than in barcelona mastroianni et al 2017 as concluded also by the esar net network esar net 2020 in the study of bijlsma et al cocaine consumption was calculated in 17 spanish cities in 2021 finding values in the range of g day 1000inh in valencia castellon reus and palma de mallorca positioning spanish cities at the top of the cocaine consumer markets bijlsma et al 2021 esar net 2020 oeda 2021 the international wastewater monitoring campaigns performed yearly by score report together with a number of publications gonzález mariño et al 2020 mackuľak et al 2014 ort et al 2014 score 2020 have demonstrated a clear geographical difference in the consumption of cocaine with higher use in southern and western europe the record 213 t of cocaine seized in 2019 indicates an expanding supply in the eu cocaine purity has been increasing over the last decade and the numbers of people entering treatment for the first time have risen over the last 5 years among the 26 countries reporting surveys 2015 2020 last year prevalence of cocaine use among young adults 15 34 was 0 2 4 6 with 8 countries reporting rates over 2 5 emcdda 2021 average cocaine use in valencia was higher than that observed in main cities from northern and eastern european countries as finland germany switzerland lithuania and slovakia been et al 2016 boogaerts et al 2021 kankaanpää et al 2016 mackuľak et al 2014 close to those of brussels van nuijs et al 2011b and several cities of france nefau et al 2013 it was also of the same order of magnitude than countries of america as costa rica andrés costa et al 2017 usa bishop et al 2020 skees et al 2018 and colombia bijlsma et al 2016 known as one to the main cocaine producing countries in the world but lower than in brazil da silva et al 2018 in most of these studies it has been demonstrated that the consumption of cocaine is higher in larger cities compared to smaller towns the calculated consumption of cocaine during 3 months in guangzhou china was two orders of magnitude lower zhang et al 2019 than those of europe or america demonstrating that cocaine is not a popular illicit drug in this county in africa the only country reporting cocaine consumption data is south africa and these can also be considered low archer et al 2018 in the same range to those reported in australia lai et al 2016 4 2 3 amphetamine type stimulants this group of drugs is the second most consumed in valencia city and surrounding towns the fluctuations observed in amphetamine and methamphetamine consumptions fig 1 can reflect changes in the market with consumers using one substance or the other depending on availability at a national level amphetamine consumption in valencia table 1 was lower than in barcelona mastroianni et al 2017 and bilbao bijlsma et al 2021 as reported by the 2021 european drug report and several studies amphetamine methamphetamine are the drugs most consumed in north central and east europe respectively bijlsma et al 2021 emcdda 2021 mackuľak et al 2014 for amphetamine the highest consumptions have been reported in denmark norway iceland and especially belgium and netherlands which exceed by far the means found in the rest of the continent gonzález mariño et al 2020 ort et al 2014 score 2020 thomas et al 2012 van nuijs et al 2011b table s9 comparatively consumptions measured in southern european cities were much lower as those reported for valencia and several cities in france nefau et al 2013 although the average use of methamphetamine in europe is low when compared to other stimulants some important hotspots have been identified mostly in eastern and northern countries as there is a market expansion from the east to north and central europe gonzález mariño et al 2020 ort et al 2014 methamphetamine consumption in valencia was lower than in other investigated cities as barcelona mastroianni et al

higher than in cities of italy zuccato et al 2016 and belgium van nuijs et al 2011b amphetamine and methamphetamine were not detected in colombia bijlsma et al 2016 and in several cities of spain e g castellon guadalajara lleida toledo where it seems that their consumption is very low and not largely extended bijlsma et al 2021 estévez danta et al 2022 in other continents methamphetamine consumption in south africa archer et al 2018 guangzhou and other chinese cities du et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 as well as in australia lai et al 2016 was much higher than in valencia which was similar to the consumption in five cities of south korea kim et al 2015 amphetamine and methamphetamine consumptions showed the highest levels found in literature in the united states skees et al 2018 in contrast to cocaine use the difference in amphetamine and methamphetamine consumptions between smaller towns and bigger cities within a country is less clear gonzález mariño et al 2020 lai et al 2016 latest epidemiological indicators and wbe data point to a revival of mdma in europe in recent years emcdda 2021 esar net 2020 however a factor that could contribute to these higher values is the known increased content of mdma in ecstasy tablets since 2010 11 emcdda 2021 gonzález mariño et al 2020 in general spain is considered a low mdma usage country but wastewater data reported to emcdda indicates an increasing trend in its use over the years for the four cities participating in score and esar net i e barcelona castellon santiago de compostela and valencia bijlsma et al 2021 emcdda 2021 esar net 2020 estévez danta et al 2022 ecstasy s consumption in valencia table 1 was of the same order than in bilbao madrid and palma de mallorca higher than in castellon and toledo bijlsma et al 2021 but lower than in barcelona mastroianni et al 2017 the highest use of mdma has been observed in western european locations compared to northern and eastern europe ones gonzález mariño et al 2020 ort et al 2014 the ecstasy s use estimated here is similar than in other european cities as those of belgium van nuijs et al 2011b france nefau et al 2013 but higher than in italy finland slovakia germany and switzerland been et al 2016 kankaanpää et al 2016 mackuľak et al 2014 zuccato et al 2016 outside europe the use of mdma is generally low as in south american countries bijlsma et al 2016 or in guangzhou china where seizures of ecstasy tablets containing little or no mdma confirmed to low consumptions levels reported in south east and east asia zhang et al 2019 similar low consumption values have been reported for the first time in south africa archer et al 2018 and several states and territories in australia lai et al 2016 as cocaine mdma use is generally higher in larger cities compared to smaller towns gonzález mariño et al 2020 thomas et al 2012 ketamine is considered a dissociative anesthetic used in powdered or liquid form despite its original design as human and more commonly veterinary anesthetic ketamine has gained popularity as club drug over the past few years according to recent studies ketamine is among the emerging drugs used in bars and discos together with other synthetic drugs as lsd mdma phencyclidine and alkyl nitrites i e poppers bijlsma et al 2016 despite the fact that ketamine was only found in 40 of samples analysed the consumptions calculated in this study can indicate that its use is not sporadic and it has increased as drug of abuse in front of its use as pharmaceutical concentrations and or consumptions of this drug and its metabolite norketamine have been mainly reported in east and south east asia du et al 2015 suggesting its use particularly in this region as in guangzhou china where ketamine was the drug most consumed among the six substances monitored during 8 weeks in 2017 zhang et al 2019 ketamine consumption in valencia is higher than in other cities as those of colombia bijlsma et al 2016 4 2 4 opioids heroin consumption in this study was back calculated by means of the concentrations of mor and although therapeutic morphine should be differentiated from that one of the illicit drug this is not corrected here since it is advised only for countries where the licit contributions of morphine can be higher than those of illicit heroin khan and nicell 2011 gracia lor et al 2016 according to the eu report member states reported 26000 heroin seizures amounting to 7 9 t in 2019 with indexed trends showing that the average purity of heroin rose by 23 between 2009 and 2019 while its price dropped 17 emcdda 2021 these figures would help to explain consumption values calculated in valencia which were similar to those of different cities in italy reported using mor zuccato et al 2016 but also those using 6mam 6 monoacetylmorphine as in barcelona mastroianni et al 2017 these were higher than in germany and switzerland been et al 2016 or in finland where it is absent kankaanpää et al 2016 but lower than in brussels van nuijs et al 2011b table s9 outside europe heroin levels were very high in usa bishop et al 2020 skees et al 2018 in colombia they were too low to be detected bijlsma et al 2016 while in costa rica they were lower than in valencia causanilles et al 2017b similarly in south africa despite heroin is considered the most commonly abused opioid in the country it was not detected at any of the wwtws analysed in 2017 archer et al 2018 methadone consumption has shown high values in western europe in valencia it was estimated through eddp or meth concentrations resulting in lower values than in other places mainly calculated by using eddp as barcelona mastroianni et al 2017 brussels van nuijs et al 2011b and several cities in france nefau et al 2013 methadone consumption in different cities of usa was calculated using meth obtaining much higher levels than in this study bishop et al 2020 skees et al 2018 values reported for these cities are about 60 times higher than in guangzhou china zhang et al 2019 on the other hand codeine use in valencia can be considered high if it is compared with the values reported in cities of costa rica causanilles et al 2017b usa bishop et al 2020 skees et al 2018 china guangzhou zhang et al 2019 or south korea kim et al 2015 finally it is important to state that even following the best practice requirements for each of the steps proposed by different authors and the score network castiglioni et al 2013 score 2020 some uncertainty related to the sampling protocol measurement of the flow rate stability of the compounds in wastewater chemical analysis performed estimation of the population size and correction factors cfs applied in the back calculations is unavoidable and consequently the validity and reliability of the results obtained and subsequent estimations made in this study have to be taken with caution as stated by these authors the loss or formation of sewage drug biomarkers is generally lower than 10 negligible uncertainty if the mean residence time of sewage in the sewer systems is 0 5 15 h as in this study other factors as adsorption onto the solid particulate matter spm and the conjugation of drug residues are not important since percentages of adsorption are estimated to be coc 3 1 becg 0 5 amp 8 6 mdma 2 4 and meth 2 3 castiglioni et al 2013 however adsorption onto spm could be a relevant issue for cannabis due to its low polarity and therefore our values for cannabis consumption could be underestimated to calculate the population size to normalize the data to the number of inhabitants served by each wwtp we have used real time calculations based on the cod 128 g day as suggested by different authors bijlsma et al 2016 causanilles et al 2017b van nuijs et al 2011b in relation to cfs this research has adopted the most recently refined and accepted cfs based on local data on the preferential route of administration to reduce wbe uncertainty and to improve comparability of the results within different studies castiglioni et al 2013 gracia lor et al 2016 thai et al 2016 however most of the literature summarised in this study used different cfs and consequently caution should paid with the comparisons made herein we have not presented our data in doses day 1000inh since it is a factor that adds additional uncertainty to the back calculated drug use values 4 3 temporal trends of drugs consumption and influence of local festivities in relation to temporal trends it can be stated that cannabis and cocaine consumption have increased in valencia city and surrounding towns comparing the values obtained in this study in 2018 2020 with those reported previously for 2011 2013 andrés costa et al 2014 although there are small differences in the cfs used in both researches consumptions were similar for methamphetamine decreased for amphetamine and increased for ecstasy which can also be associated to the higher mdma purity observed in last years gracia lor et al 2017 score 2020 ketamine consumption estimated for 2017 20 is significantly lower than the one reported for 2011 13 andrés costa et al 2014 but this is related to different cfs used heroin in the previous study could not be calculated by means of 6 mam compared to this one in which it was calculated through mor showing low consumptions as methadone that was not reported in 2011 13 for valencia andrés costa et al 2014 cannabis consumption remarkably increased also in barcelona between 2011 and 2015 mastroianni et al 2017 increasing trends have also been reported in italy in 2010 14 zuccato et al 2016 the increased cocaine consumption values in valencia city and surrounding towns agrees with the general tendency observed across europe within the last years gonzález mariño et al 2020 zuccato et al 2016 although this can be explained by a higher prevalence of cocaine use or a similar number of consumers using a higher amount of drug it can also be related to an increased drug purity 32 54 from 2009 to 2016 emcdda 2021 according to the emccd of the 49 cities that have data on cocaine residues in municipal wastewater for 2019 and 2020 19 reported an increase 14 a stable situation and 16 a decrease the most recent data indicate that cocaine is becoming more common in cities in the east of europe although detection levels remain low emcdda 2021 score 2020 fluctuations detected for amphetamine and methamphetamine levels during the study period fig 1 have also been observed in barcelona where an increasing trend was observed within 2011 15 then it seems to be stabilized or even slightly decreased in most recent years mastroianni et al 2017 in the eu of the 48 cities with data on amphetamine residues in municipal wastewater for 2019 and 2020 20 reported an increase 9 a stable situation and 19 a decrease emcdda 2021 on the other hand methamphetamine use in barcelona increased considerably since 2011 as in some cities of finland and switzerland where considerable increases were measured for 2014 17 bijlsma et al 2021 gonzález mariño et al 2020 kankaanpää et al 2016 of the 50 cities that have data on methamphetamine residues in municipal wastewater for 2019 and 2020 15 reported an increase 14 a stable situation and 21 a decrease bijlsma et al 2021 emcdda 2021 among the countries consistently providing data on purity and price the average purity of amphetamine has increased markedly over the past decade while the price has remained relatively stable whereas the overall average purity and price of methamphetamine in 2019 were comparable to the values reported in 2009 emcdda 2021 outside europe methamphetamine and ketamine use 2012 14 in several chinese cities were reported to significantly increase and decrease respectively du et al 2015 recently consumption of both drugs was detected to be reduced in guangzhou china from may to october 2017 and explained because of a series of law enforcement anti narcotics operations that destroyed several large scale transnational channels of methamphetamine trafficking zhang et al 2019 declining consumptions of methamphetamine 14 per year and ketamine were reported in a city in southern china 2012 18 zheng et al 2021 mdma underwent an intermittent upsurge in europe during 2011 17 gonzález mariño et al 2020 while it was stable over the period 2012 18 in china zheng et al 2021 of the 49 cities that have data on mdma residues in municipal wastewater in 2019 20 18 reported an increase 7 a stable situation and 24 a decrease emcdda 2021 among these cities mdma use has increased in finland germany and switzerland been et al 2016 kankaanpää et al 2016 but particularly in amsterdam likely reflecting its position as a tourism and nightlife destination the average annual use of heroin in barcelona 2011 15 in several cities of italy 2010 14 and in china 2012 18 showed a decreasing trend mastroianni et al 2017 zheng et al 2021 zuccato et al 2016 although with some fluctuations methadone was stable over the period 2012 18 in china zhang et al 2019 zheng et al 2021 and codeine in guangzhou during 3 months in 2017 zhang et al 2019 4 3 1 weekly patterns of drugs use in valencia city weekly patterns of drugs use were deduced by the changes observed in their concentrations at the inlet of wwtps confirming the recreational character of some of these substances in valencia city and its surrounding towns three drugs namely cocaine ecstasy and heroin showed a weekly trend with significantly higher consumption values during the weekend compared to the weekdays the first two were expected because of their popularity in the dance and music scene but the higher use of heroin was unexpected although positive detections in samples collected in barcelona from friday to monday suggest a comparable pattern mastroianni et al 2017 similar results were already reported in valencia in 2011 13 but instead of heroin amphetamine was reported andrés costa et al 2014 other european cities ort et al 2014 thomas et al 2012 including those of belgium van nuijs et al 2011b france nefau et al 2013 italy zuccato et al 2016 and slovakia mackuľak et al 2014 together with some in south america as brazil da silva et al 2018 africa as south africa archer et al 2018 and oceania as australia lai et al 2016 highlighted also the higher use of drugs such as amphetamine cocaine and ecstasy during weekends indicating that the consumption of these drugs is associated with recreational and socializing purposes worth mentioning is the case of barcelona where mdma consumption was duplicated during weekends reaching maxima on sunday 251 31 g day mastroianni et al 2017 in valencia city the significant higher use of mdma friday to sunday is shifted with one day compared with cocaine thursday to sunday which can be due to different usage trends of both illicit drugs but also to differences in the excretion patterns maximal concentrations in urine half lives van nuijs et al 2011b tobacco cannabis amphetamine methamphetamine ketamine methadone and codeine concentrations were relatively constant throughout the week as it has been observed previously in valencia andrés costa et al 2014 and other european cities nefau et al 2013 ort et al 2014 thomas et al 2012 zuccato et al 2016 but also in colombia bogota and medellin for cannabis bijlsma et al 2016 and in guangzhou for methamphetamine ketamine methadone and codeine zhang et al 2019 the lack of weekend effect for amphetamine can be due to the fact that is also legally used in the treatment of several disorders narcolepsy and adhd and it is also a metabolite of several pharmaceuticals fenethylline fenproporex and selegiline van nuijs et al 2011b as for methadone that is prescribed for a daily intake van nuijs et al 2011b 4 3 2 impact of the main local festivity in the drugs use of valencia city finally significant increases in the consumption of cocaine amphetamine methamphetamine and mainly mdma were observed during las fallas in 2014 fig 3 cocaine amphetamine and methamphetamine consumption were almost doubled but the highest growth was detected for the mdma which was around four times higher a previous study has already reported the increased use of alcohol during these festivities andrés costa et al 2016 similar results have been reported in different festivals special events or holiday periods in different cities of the world in slovakia mackuľak et al 2014 higher consumption of methamphetamine 163 mg day 1000inh and cocaine up to 1800 mg day 1000inh were measured in the lodenica country and folk music festival ecstasy consumption was festival dependent with an extremely high use during the music festival in trenčín whereas no significant increase in the cannabis consumption was found during the two music festivals in brussels the highest level of cocaine use was observed on new year s eve 1544 mg day 1000inh christmas period 1063 mg day 1000inh and during easter holiday 1032 1048 mg day 1000inh van nuijs et al 2011b mdma s peak use was observed at new year s eve and around easter 286 and 144 mg day 1000inh respectively in amsterdam high ecstasy s consumption values estimated were related to a big halloween dance party van der aa et al 2013 outside europe a significantly higher consumption of methamphetamine 42 and cocaine 47 was observed during the spring festival week of guangzhou china compared with the control period similarly higher mean consumption 37 of mdma was observed during national day holidays in brazil a significant high cocaine use was observed in the carnival day of 2018 6229 mg day 1000inh being one of the highest reported in the literature da silva et al 2018 5 conclusion wbe methodology was successfully applied to assess the occurrence and tendencies of various licit and illicit drugs in valencia city and surrounding towns during one two weeks between 2011 and 2020 consumption estimates indicate that cannabis tobacco and cocaine are the most consumed drugs in the study area temporal trends were difficult to evaluate but it seems that drug use increased since 2018 which is in agreement with the official statistics in the region consumption of cocaine amphetamine and mdma was found to be higher during the weekends confirming the recreational purposes of these drugs similarly during las fallas main local festivity increased use of cocaine and amphetamine type stimulants mainly mdma was measured results of this research highlights the relevance of wbe which can complement classic epidemiological indicators e g prevalence data and seizures statistics to jointly draw a more comprehensive picture of the drug use patterns in valencia city wbe estimates allowed us to evaluate data on drug use in a specific region in an objective fast inexpensive and anonymous way in relation to the uncertainties associated to this approach the current cfs need to be updated and harmonized to be used as part of the best practice protocol annual more intensive sampling 1week is also advised to assess temporal variations more clearly wbe is an extremely flexible tool for application at different spatial and temporal scales which can help us to get more insight on the tendencies on licit and illicit drugs consumption and the changes derived from local festivities declaration of

14726,wastewater based epidemiology wbe approach provides objective quantitative near real time profiles of illicit drug consumption by monitoring the concentration of unchanged parent drugs or their metabolites entering the municipal sewage system valencia is the third most populous city in spain an important country for the use and transit of several of these drugs estimations of consumption over long periods of time will help get better understanding of spatial and temporal trends in the use of licit and illicit drugs accordingly applying the best practice protocol 16 drugs of abuse and metabolites were monitored in this study and 8 were daily measured during one two weeks between 2011 and 2020 at the inlet of three wastewater treatment plants of valencia city analysis of the selected compounds was performed by liquid chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometry and the concentrations obtained were used to back calculate the consumption data cannabis tobacco and cocaine were the most consumed drugs whereas opioids were less used cannabis and cocaine consumption are on average 2 7 23 4 and 1 1 2 3 g day 1000inh respectively and their use tended to increase since 2018 weekly profiles were characterized by higher consumption of cocaine ecstasy and heroin during weekends compared to weekdays similarly during las fallas main local festivity increased use of

drugs or their metabolites entering the municipal sewage system bijlsma et al 2021 gonzález mariño et al 2020 lorenzo and picó 2019 mercan et al 2019 vitale et al 2021 these concentrations in the influent of wastewater treatment plants wwtps are used to back calculate the mass loads of the parent drugs and or metabolites and finally to estimate the consumption g day or doses day according to the drug metabolism and excretion patterns additionally with the population served by the wwtp and the standard dose in which drugs are consumed the results can be normalized to g day 1000 inhabitants or doses day 1000 inhabitants and then used to make comparisons among locations gonzález mariño et al 2020 mercan et al 2019 estimation of wbe has become complementary to general population surveys on drug of abuse consumption sales data medical records drug seizures etc bijlsma et al 2021 emcdda 2021 ort et al 2014 it is considered a suitable alternative to estimate objectively licit and illicit drugs consumption avoiding problems such as the lack of objectivity of the information collected from population surveys not all consumers would report it the late response time of these surveys long implementation periods and their significantly higher cost as well as their uneven spatial resolution not granting realistic drugs use estimation at regional scales the different socioeconomic and cultural factors defining consumers habits and trends are not well represented castiglioni et al 2013 mastroianni et al 2017 van nuijs et al 2011a currently wbe is used by an increasing number of researchers to calculate the intake of a large variety of illicit drugs in cities from a number of european countries as in belgium van nuijs et al 2011b france nefau et al 2013 spain andrés costa et

at global level 120 cities in 37 countries gonzález mariño et al 2020 furthermore wbe is also very helpful to identify changes during special events i e festivals sporting events or holiday periods to monitor variations in drugs use through time and to recognize new habits or the emergence of new illicit drugs as the new psychoactive substances andrés costa et al 2017 bijlsma et al 2021 gonzález mariño et al 2018 because of its increasing use wbe is a methodology in continuous improvement causanilles et al 2017a choi et al 2018 mercan et al 2019 vitale et al 2021 the analytical procedures for the determination of the compounds usually performed by solid phase extraction fontanals et al 2019 followed by high specific and sensitive determination techniques such as liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms have reached great robustness and excellent sensitivity and selectivity by using triple quadrupole qqq or quadrupole linear ion trap qtrap analysers bijlsma et al 2012 gonzález mariño et al 2018 mastroianni et al 2017 moreover less used high resolution mass spectrometry with time of flight or orbitrap analysers has proved outstanding performance for qualitative and quantitative analysis of illicit drugs and their metabolites andrés costa et al 2017 bijlsma et al 2012 gonzález mariño et al 2012 great progress has also been achieved in the back calculations that transform measured concentrations in wastewater into an amount of used illicit drugs particularly in relation to the homogenization of correction factors cfs derived from the

communicate them to authorities and policymakers according to the reports of the emcdda spain is an important country of transit of several illicit drugs such as cannabis and cocaine due to its cultural linguistic and colonial ties to latin america and its proximity to morocco bijlsma et al 2021 and the quantity of seized ones and the prevalence of their use rank spain at the top of europe emcdda 2021 valencia is the third most populous city in spain with 1 2 million inhabitants including its metropolitan area sadutto et al 2021 behind madrid and barcelona and estimations of drug consumption over long periods of time will help get better understanding of spatial and temporal differences and trends in use of illicit drugs by means of the wbe approach this study aims to i estimate the consumption of 16 licit and illicit drugs in valencia spain during 10 consecutive years although only 8 were actually determined annually ii compare valencia s wbe consumption estimates with those of other cities iii establish temporal weekly patterns of drug use in the city between 2011 and 2020 and iv assess the impact of the main local festivity las fallas in the estimated drugs average consumption tendencies to do this 16 compounds including several licit and illicit drugs cocaine cannabis tobacco opiates and amphetamine type stimulants and their metabolites were daily monitored during one two weeks between 2011 and 2020 at the inlet of three wwtps treating the wastewater of valencia city spain and its surrounding towns 2 material and methods 2 1 reagents and

solution ranging from 10 ng ml to 500 ng ml with addition of the iss mix at a final concentration of 100 ng ml stock and working solutions were stored at 20 ºc in the dark water used for preparation of calibration standards and uhplc ms ms mobile phase was purified by an elix milli q system millipore billerica ma usa methanol was purchased from vwr international barcelona spain and formic acid was from sigma aldrich st louis mo eeuu the cartridges used to extract analytes from samples were strata x 33 µm polymeric reversed phase 200 mg 6 ml from phenomenex torrance ca usa 2 2 sampling samples were collected from the influent of three different wwtps in valencia pinedo 1 pinedo 2 and quart benager receiving wastewater from valencia and other small surrounding towns the catchment area of pinedo 1 p1 and pinedo 2 p2 consists of about 351 000 and 943 000 inhabitants respectively while the catchment area of quart benager qb consists of 215 000 inhabitants the main characteristics of each wwtp are summarized in table s1 supplementary information sampling campaigns were carried out during 10 years thus 2011 march 10th to 16th 2012 april 17th to may 1st 2013 march 6th to 12th

here that during 2014 samples were also gathered during las fallas main local festivity which is from march 15th to march 19th samples 24 h composite were collected using the operational equipment of the wwtps in a time proportional manner at 60 min time intervals which was fixed by the wwtps and generally accepted because its uncertainty is lower than 5 castiglioni et al 2013 mccall et al 2016 composite samples instead of grab samples were selected in this study to get the maximum representativeness according to the best practice protocol recommended for wastewater studies castiglioni et al 2013 rico et al 2017 vitale et al 2021 all samples were stored in polyethylene terephthalate bottles once the samples arrived at the laboratory they were immediately frozen at 20 ºc until analysis to prevent degradation of the compounds to be analysed 2 3 sample preparation iss were added to the samples 250 ml which were then vacuum filtered using 0 60 µm glass fiber filter ga 55 90 mm purchased from advantec mfs dublin usa before solid phase extraction procedure for the latter cartridges were previously conditioned with 6 ml methanol and 6 ml of elix milli q water illicit drugs were extracted using polymeric reversed phase cartridges and a 12 port vacuum manifold supelco visiprep 57 030 u of sigma aldrich st louis mo eeuu samples without ph adjustment were passed through the cartridges under vacuum at a flow rate of 10 ml min after that the cartridges were washed with 6 ml of elix milli q water and dried under vacuum for 15 min analytes were eluted with 6 ml of methanol evaporated to dryness at 40 c using a combined sample concentrator model sbhconc 1 and a heating plate model sbh130d 3 by stuart stafford uk dissolved in 1 ml of water methanol 90 10 v v and then stored in 2 ml amber glass vials ready for analysis 2 4 uhplc qqq ms ms chromatographic separation was performed using an agilent 1260 uhplc agilent waldbronn germany the separation was carried out with a phenomenex kinetex c18 1 7 µm 100 a 50 2 10 mm at temperature of 25 ºc and constant flow rate of 0 2 ml min the mobile phase was eluent a formic acid 0 1 in water and eluent b formic acid 0 1 in methanol the gradient elution was started at 10 b maintained for 5 min then increased linearly to 95 b in 12 min and remained constant at 95 b up to 25 min then it returns to the initial conditions with an equilibrium time of 15 min the injection volume was 5 ml the injection was long to use a flow compatible with ms detection the uhplc was coupled to an agilent 6410 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with an electrospray ionization source mode 300 ºc gas temperature 11 l min gas flow and 25 psi nebulizer the optimal quantification and confirmation transitions as well as the specific ms parameters were optimized for each compound table s2 2 5 quality control limits of quantification loqs recovery precision and matrix effects are outlined in table s3 the linearity was also evaluated by injecting in triplicate 5 concentration levels from 10 to 500 ng l using is calibration to avoid errors due to matrix effect the combination of such matrix effect and extraction efficiency was estimated from the iss which were spiked at the same concentration into all samples the lowest concentration used in the calibration curve is close to the loqs from 1 1 to 7 8 ng l for practical reasons to the common laboratory routine it was much easier to select a value slightly over the loqs calibration curves were linear with correlation coefficient r2 0 99 for all compounds extraction recoveries were evaluated in quintuplicated by spiking aliquots of deionized water with the analytes at the loq and at 500 ng l of each analyte and of influent wastewater at 100 and 500 ng l in the latter as all analytes were in the sample five aliquots of a sample with low concentrations were spiked at each concentration and other five aliquots of this sample were measured without analytes spike then the spiked samples after non spiked sample signal subtraction were compared to the calibration curve recoveries were 65 126 in deionized water and 78 122 in influent wastewater the repeatability and reproducibility between days of five samples spiked at 100 and 500 ng l in both types of matrix expressed as relative standard deviation rsd were lower than 26 and 20 respectively table s3 2 6 estimation of collective drug use drugs loads to wwtps eq 1 and consumptions eq 2 were back calculated from the measured daily concentration of the drug target according to the following equations andrés costa et al 2014 mastroianni et al 2017 1 l mg day c ng l fr l day 1 0 6 mg ng 2 q mg day 1000 inh l mg day cf 1000 ninh where l is the drug s load to the wwtp c is its concentration fr is the daily flow rate of each wwtp q is the drug s consumption cf is the correction factor that takes into account the molar mass ratio between the parent drug and the drug residue as well as the percentage of metabolic excretion for detailed values see castiglioni et al 2013 du et al 2015 gracia lor et al 2016 postigo et al 2011 thai et al 2016 and table s4 and ninh is the number of inhabitants served by the wwtp estimated by means of the biological oxygen demand bod of each sampled day van nuijs et al 2011b finally it is important to mention that in order to minimize the uncertainty related to wbe estimates we have adopted and strictly followed in this study the best practice requirements for each of the steps proposed castiglioni et al 2013 score 2020 2 7 statistical analysis normality of the data was tested using shapiro wilk s test n 50 and homogeneity of variances by means of levene s test for the parametric analysis differences in drug s concentrations and consumptions between years days and wwtps were established through one way anova for non parametric analysis differences were determined by the tests of mann whitney u m w or kruskal wallis k w in all the cases results were considered to be statistically significant at p 0 05 all statistical analyses were carried out using ibm spss statistics 27 3 results 3 1 occurrence of drugs in samples of

5 fig s1 according to these concentrations there are some significant differences in their patterns between the three wwtps considered for valencia city and its surrounding towns averaging the whole study period the concentration of thccooh and coti were similar among wwtps p 0 05 although the former tended to be higher in p1 and the latter in qb on the other hand the concentrations of coc and all its metabolites becg cocet and ecme were significantly different p 0 05 being higher in qb than in p1 and p2 qb p1 p2 in relation to amphetamine type stimulants significant differences p 0 05 were found on the concentrations of amp mdma p1 p2 qb and mamp p1 p2 qb whereas those of ket tended to be higher in p1 and qb than in p2 p 0 05 for the opioids mor concentrations tended to be higher in qb p 0 05 eddp levels followed the trend p1 p2 qb p 0 05 meth tended to be higher in p1 and p2 than in qb and cod tended to be higher in p2 and qb than in p1 p 0 05 based on the flows of each wwtp and the analytes concentrations found in them loads in g day of these substances arriving to valencia s wwtps were calculated tables s7 and s8 mean values were becg 121 5 288 4 coc 20 8 169 5 ecme 3 9 69

as coti 117 5 333 3 and cod 23 3 132 2 the opioids eddp 9 8 11 3 and meth 0 5 7 5 as well as buf 1 5 8 3 and eta 0 8 2 1 were in similar ranges but it should be kept in mind that these analytes were measured during shorter periods in general the highest loads were observed in p2 followed by those of p1 and qb which are directly related to their flows 3 2 estimation of drugs consumption in valencia city according to the results obtained tables 1 and 2 mean consumption of licit and illicit drugs in mg day 1000inh in valencia was high for cannabis 2748 9 23351 0 and tobacco as nicotine 1893 3 5486 0 followed by cocaine calculated through becg 1126 4 2258 3 coc 553 6 4097 6 cocet 459 5 4649 1 or ecme 37 3 465 9 then codeine 180 5 1046 3 bufotenine 93 8 343 0 and amphetamine type stimulants as mdma 15 4 102 5 amp 23 1 66 8 and mamp 3 7 50 6 heroin calculated by means of morphine 21 1 164 3 showed low consumption followed by ketamine 7 9 48 9 methadone as eddp 21 0 37 9 or meth 13 8 41 7 and finally etamine 4 1 15 8 despite the fact that consumption calculations are directly related to the wwtps flows p2 p1 qb some trends can also be observed when they are compared averaging the whole study period the consumption of cannabis was significantly different between wwtps p 0 05 with p1 p2 qb tobacco use tended to be higher in p2 than in qb and p1 p 0 05 on the other hand cocaine use tended to be higher in qb when calculated with becg or cocet p 0 05 in p1 and p2 when with coc p 0 05 and in p1 and qb when using ecme p 0 05 amphetamine type stimulants consumption showed significant differences among wwtps p 0 05 with amphetamine p1 p2 qb methamphetamine ecstasy and ketamine p1 p2 qb in relation to opioids heroin and codeine consumption tended to be higher in p1 and p2 than in qb p 0 05 whereas methadone presented significant differences p 0 05 when calculated with both eddp and meth p1 p2 qb 3 3 temporal trends of drugs consumption and influence of local festivities mean consumptions of selected illicit drugs were relatively homogenous throughout the studied period with significant higher values in different years tables 1 and 2 worth mentioning are the higher values calculated in 2011 and 2012 for mamp 90 7 and 60 6 mg day 1000inh respectively p 0 05 general tendencies cannot be established for the whole study period although it can be stated that some increasing trends were observed in the last years since 2018 with significantly higher consumption values calculated in 2019 for cannabis particularly in p2 62107 8 mg day 1000inh and for cocaine 7083 5 mg day 1000inh heroin 446 6 mg day 1000inh and ketamine 146 0 mg day 1000inh in qb weekly consumption profiles of the different drugs are presented in fig 2 as the addition of the average daily use mg day 1000inh calculated in each wwtp three drugs cocaine heroin and ecstasy showed a weekly trend with significantly higher consumption values during the weekend compared to the weekdays p 0 05 while cocaine was more used from thursday to sunday heroin and mdma were from friday to sunday in fig 2 these consumptions correspond to the values presented the day after as the samples were collected from 8 30 am of the day before to 8 30 am of the day of sampling this is the value of friday corresponds to the consumption of thursday as for cocaine consumption weekend estimates averaged 5912 9 mg day 1000inh which is significantly higher p 0 05 than the value of weekdays 4192 8 mg day 1000inh ecstasy s consumption during weekends was also significantly higher p 0 05 during the weekend 157 7 mg day 1000inh than in week days 104 6 mg day 1000inh on the other hand similar weekly consumptions were assessed for tobacco amphetamine methamphetamine ketamine codeine and cannabis in relation to the consumption of drugs during special events a local festivity called las fallas was monitored in 2014 this festivity starts the 15th march and finishes the 19th march of every year having this in mind consumptions calculated between the 16th and the 20th of march were compared with those of the days before observing a significant increase p 0 05 in the consumption of cocaine and amphetamine type stimulants mainly mdma amphetamine and methamphetamine fig 3 the highest consumption growth was detected for the mdma which passed from 80 8 to 335 8 mg day 1000inh cocaine consumption was also almost doubled during las fallas compared to previous days as proved the values calculated using becg 5972 1 vs 3592 7 mg day 1000inh coc 7046 0 vs 4897 8 mg day 1000inh and cocet 4519 6 vs 2357 8 mg day 1000inh amphetamine and methamphetamine consumption were also increased from 90 8 mg day 1000inh before festivity to 168 2 mg day 1000inh during festivity and from 13 2 to 29 2 mg day 1000inh respectively 4 discussion 4 1 occurrence of drugs in samples of valencia wastewaters according to the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction emcdda around 83 million or 28 9 of adults aged 15 64 in the eu are estimated to have used illicit drugs at least once in their lifetime in 2020 about 17 4 million young adults 15 34 used drugs in the last year 16 9 emcdda 2021 although these data should be regarded as a minimum estimate due to possible reporting biases they highlight the relevance of the problem of illicit drug s use in eu not only for the health but also for the safety and wellbeing of its citizens results of this study confirmed the elevated use of licit and illicit drugs in valencia city and surrounding towns tables s5 and s6 despite the fact that some spatial trends could be found among the levels found in the different wwtps p1 showed higher concentrations of thccooh all the amphetamine like stimulants eddp and meth p2 of cod whereas qb presented higher concentrations of coti coc and its metabolites and mor these will be discussed as averages for all the study area cocaine coc and the metabolite benzoylecgonine becg were the compounds more frequently detected and at higher concentrations reaching the µg l in the wastewater samples of valencia city and surrounding towns tables s5 and s6 similar pattern and concentrations were found in different cities of spain bijlsma et al 2021 estévez danta et al 2022 confirming previous data of barcelona mastroianni et al 2017 and different cities of france nefau et al 2013 they were higher than those of slovakia finland and lithuania boogaerts et al 2021 kankaanpää et al 2016 mackuľak et al 2014 high frequencies but low concentrations were reported in the usa bishop et al 2020 skees et al 2018 comparable becg frequencies and concentrations were also found in colombia bijlsma et al 2016 and of coc in costa rica andrés costa et al 2017 in other regions as guangzhou china coc was not found in any sample and although becg was quantified in 85 of samples its concentration was very low zhang et al 2019 cocaethylene cocet another metabolite of cocaine also showed high concentrations tens hundreds ng l as in brazil da silva et al 2018 but it was found in less of the half of samples analysed in 2014 2017 the 2021 european drug report identified cocaine as the second most prevalent and second most frequently seized illicit stimulant in europe emcdda 2021 and the 2021 report of the spanish observatory on drugs and addictions oeda confirmed cocaine as one of the drugs with the highest use prevalence 2 5 among the spanish population 15 64 in 2019 2020 oeda 2021 in general higher concentrations of becg than of coc and ecme were measured in the three wwtp considered which is expected since becg excretion percentage after cocaine consumption is higher leading to concentrations superior to those of coc archer et al 2018 da silva et al 2018 nefau et al 2013 becg is considered more stable no loss of analyte in sewage up to 72 h at 4 c and up to 12 h at 20 c conditions respected in this study and because coc can partially degrade hydrolysis to becg in blood and urine castiglioni et al 2013 additionally coc and ecme are less stable in sewage and becg could increase by as much as 20 over 24 h at 4 c because of their biodegradation castiglioni et al 2013 van nuijs et al 2011b to check for excessive biotransformation of coc to becg the coc becg ratio has been calculated based on their molar mass relation and on the excretion rate limits as unchanged coc and as becg cut off values of 0 75 and 0 27 have been used bijlsma et al 2012 the ratios obtained in this study are between these two values with some higher values similarly to other studies andrés costa et al 2017 castiglioni et al 2013 mastroianni et al 2017 thai et al 2016 suggesting other likely sources of coc to wastewater related to deliberate or accidental disposal of the drug into the sewer andrés costa et al 2014 or to other routes of consumption despite nicotine metabolite measured coti was only analysed in the period 2014 2017 their high concentrations in the range of µg l agree with the trends reported in a recent publication estévez danta et al 2022 according to which the recreational drugs with the highest use prevalence among the spanish population 15 64 are alcohol 63 and tobacco 32 oeda 2021 in this study besides cocaine cannabis was among the illicit drugs most frequently detected in wastewater samples based on data from 26 countries that undertook a survey between 2015 and 2020 last year cannabis use among eu inhabitants 15 34 is estimated at 15 4 and general population surveys indicate around 1 8 of adults 15 64 in the eu are daily or almost daily cannabis users emcdda 2021 with 37 5 of the spanish population within this age that has ever used cannabis 10 5 in 2020 and a consumption prevalence in the last month of 8 oeda 2021 cannabis active principle ingredient is δ9 tetrahydrocannabinol δ9 thc but its high metabolization leads to a very low excretion rate making thccooh or 11 oh thc the metabolites to be used for thc back calculation the former is preferred since it is a relatively stable biotransformation product in wastewater and because 11 oh thc is rapidly oxidized to thccooh andrés costa et al 2017 gracia lor et al 2016 these data help to explain the ubiquity of thccooh in the wastewater samples analysed similarly to other studies bijlsma et al 2021 nefau et al 2013 zuccato et al 2016 additionally cannabis resin sold in europe is now more potent than before 20 28 more thc and there are high thc content products and new forms of cannabis on the illicit market as well as a bunch of products containing cannabis extracts sold commercially emcdda 2021 which can also be responsible of the high concentration values of the samples table s5 in the range of tens hundreds of ng l as reported in several cities of spain bijlsma et al 2021 estévez danta et al 2022 mastroianni et al 2017 slovakia mackuľak et al 2014 colombia bijlsma et al 2016 costa rica andrés costa et al 2017 usa skees et al 2018 but lower than those found in some cities of france nefau et al 2013 amphetamine like stimulants amp mamp ket and mdma can be considered as a third group of the illicit drugs more generally detected in valencia city and surrounding towns wastewater according to the 2021 european drug report amphetamine is the europe s second most consumed stimulant drug after cocaine surveys from 25 countries 2015 2020 suggested that 1 4 million young adults 15 34 used amphetamine during the last year 1 4 of this age group which would confirm the frequencies found in this study similar to those of barcelona mastroianni et al 2017 but higher than those in france nefau et al 2013 italy zuccato et al 2016 and even in china du et al 2015 seizures data also confirmed this trend since in 2019 eu member states reported 34000 seizures of amphetamine amounting to 17 0 tonnes t and 10000 of methamphetamine 2 9 t of which 1 6 t were seized in spain originating in mexico in relation to the high concentrations found in samples besides the high number of users these could be related to the increasing average purities reported in the eu 13 67 for amphetamine and 16 94 for methamphetamine in 2019 emcdda 2021 even though these concentrations are lower than those reported in other continents as north america skees et al 2018 average amp concentrations in valencian wwtps samples were higher than those of mamp table s5 in addition to a possible higher number of users and despite being considered generally stable no loss of analyte in sewage in line with stability studies in urine at 37 c for 3 days and longer castiglioni et al 2013 there is approximately 4 7 of mamp that is excreted as amp gonzález mariño et al 2020 besides amp and mamp can be directly disposed into sewer systems there can also be a part derived from high prescribed use of amp in therapeutic drugs as amphetaminil benzphetamine clobenzorex dimethylamphetamine ethylamphetamine famprofazone fencamine mefenorex prenylamine selegiline etc an amount of drug that needs to be differentiated from that one consumed and excreted e g by chiral chromatography and fingerprint analyses archer et al 2018 bijlsma et al 2021 but that is not corrected here their prescription rates in europe indicate that any contribution would generally be 1 of the total amp amounts ort et al 2014 thomas et al 2012 amp and mamp concentrations in valencia tens of ng l were slightly lower than in barcelona mastroianni et al 2017 or cities in france slovakia and finland kankaanpää et al 2016 mackuľak et al 2014 nefau et al 2013 and usa bishop et al 2020 skees et al 2018 hundreds of ng l in the study of bijlsma et al bijlsma et al 2021 considering 17 cities in spain including valencia amp and mamp s concentrations of barcelona and bilbao were in the same range but those of castellon guadalajara lleida or toledo were lower or not detected results obtained in different cities of china presented contrasted results in a southern city amp concentrations were lower but mamp were similar zheng et al 2021 while in guangzhou and other cities of china those of amp were similar while those of mamp were higher du et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 according to gracia lor et al gracia lor et al 2016 the unchanged mdma and two of its metabolites hmma 4 hydroxy 3 methoxymethamphetamine and hhma 3 4 dihydroxy methampheta mine can be considered for back calculation in wbe studies however these authors also state that without actual data is difficult to predict if these conjugates will be fully reverted to the parent compound in sewage and consequently the unchanged mdma is advised to be measured europe remains an important source of mdma products that supply the global market surveys from 26 eu countries 2015 2020 suggest that 2 million young adults 15 34 used ecstasy in the last year 1 9 of this age group emcdda 2021 and 5 of the spanish population 15 64 has ever used it oeda 2021 high frequencies of mdma detection in the samples analysed table s5 are also supported by the increasing number of seizures of mdma powder in the eu 0 3 t in 2016 to 2 2 t in 2018 and 2019 corresponding to 4 6 million mdma tablets additionally the high concentrations found here could be related to the 149 average increased quantity of mdma in tablets measured since 2009 118 210 mg mdma tablet in 2019 based on data of the emcdda s 2021 report emcdda 2021 concentrations of mdma tens of ng l in valencia were similar to those of slovakia mackuľak et al 2014 colombia less frequent bijlsma et al 2016 several other cities of spain

eu countries an amount considerably lower compared to those of other amphetamine like stimulants which explain the low frequencies and concentrations detected here ket concentrations in valencia tens of ng l were similar to the levels reported in other spanish bijlsma et al 2021 and colombian cities bijlsma et al 2016 it was ubiquitous in samples of different cities in china and at higher

spanish population 15 64 has used heroin at some time and only 0 1 in the last year an use that has stabilized since the mid 1990s oeda 2021 in the eu the problems with this drug can be higher based on the 26000 heroin and other opioids seizures 7 9 t average purity of heroin 11 51 reported in 2019 with 1 million high risk opioid users emcdda 2021 despite codeine was only analysed in the period 2014 2017 their high concentrations in the range of µg l confirmed opioid analgesics as codeine and tramadol as the drugs with highest prevalence use among the population 15 64 oeda 2021 their concentrations are higher than those reported in a community in the midwestern united states skees et al 2018 codeine is reported to be stable in wastewater but it is rarely analysed and even less information is found for bufotenine and etamine which levels tens of ng l makes suspect their relative low consumption in valencia cod presented high frequencies and concentrations in this study which were higher than those reported in costa rica hundreds of ng l andrés costa et al 2017 or in guangzhou china ng l zhang et al 2019 in this study heroin is back calculated using mor concentrations since it is considered as the most abundant metabolite of heroin nevertheless it is also an indicator of the use of therapeutic morphine codeine ethylmorphine pholcodine and nicomorphine which concentrations should be differentiated from that one of mor but they are not corrected here since it is advised only for countries where the licit contributions of morphine can be higher than those of illicit heroin khan and nicell 2011 gracia lor et al 2016 concentrations measured in valencia hundreds of ng l were similar to the values detected in france nefau et al 2013 but higher than in costa rica or usa tens of ng l andrés costa et al 2017 skees et al 2018 and china zheng et al 2021 on the other hand for methadone its parent compound meth and its metabolite eddp were used here despite meth and eddp were not measured all years their levels were similar tens of ng l and alike to those reported in several cities of france nefau et al 2013 and of usa bishop et al 2020 skees et al 2018 but higher than in china ng l zheng et al 2021 in order to check for possible transformation of meth to eddp the meth eddp ratio has been calculated obtaining values between 0 2 and 1 2 in the range of other studies castiglioni et al 2013 mastroianni et al 2017 thai et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 which suggested deliberate or accidental disposal of the drug into the sewer 4 2 estimation of drugs consumption in valencia city as it was stated despite the fact that wwtps flows follow the trend p2 p1 qb there are important differences between the population they serve only tobacco consumption tended to be higher in p2 than in qb and p1 for cannabis cocaine estimated through coc or ecme all amphetamine type stimulants and opioids the trend was p1 p2 qb cocaine calculated by means of becg or the cocet concentrations tended to higher in qb it can be stated that the consumption of most of the drugs analysed in this study was higher for the population served by p1 this can be explained because this wwtp only treats water from valencia city which is the capital of the community and the third largest city in spain with many leisure places and night life on the other hand p2 and qb treat in addition to part of the wastewater of valencia city that of several surrounding towns and their industrial areas and despite being known for their bars and discos their activity can be considered less intense in valencia the most consumed drugs according to our wbe analysis were cannabis tobacco and cocaine fig 1 although we only measured nicotine s metabolite from 2014 to 2017 the 2021 report of the spanish observatory on drugs and addictions oeda confirmed these three as the drugs with the highest use prevalence among the spanish population 15 64 in the last year here they were followed by codeine in 2014 2017 and amphetamine type stimulants as mdma amp and mamp heroin showed low consumption as well as ketamine methadone and etamine tables 1 and 2 in a previous study andres costa et al andrés costa et al 2014 have proven that cannabis and cocaine were the most consumed drugs in valencia in agreement with results of wbe studies in other spanish cities as barcelona mastroianni et al 2017 and western european countries as italy zuccato et al 2016 and france methadone was also high nefau et al 2013 similarly in these studies amphetamine methamphetamine and ecstasy were reported as a second group of illicit drugs with lower consumptions whereas opioids heroin and or methadone were the less consumed ones 4 2 1 cannabis and tobacco cannabis consumption in valencia table 2 was comparable to other spanish cities e g madrid and bilbao bijlsma et al 2021 table s9 but lower than in barcelona mastroianni et al 2017 which continuously increased since 2012 becoming almost three times higher in four years and the highest in spain bijlsma et al 2021 in 2019 eu member states reported 326000 seizures of cannabis resin amounting to 465 t and 313000 seizures of herbal cannabis amounting to 148 t emcdda 2021 which confirm the very high amount of cannabis moving across the eu its use in valencia is higher than in other european cities as those from italy zuccato et al 2016 france nefau et al 2013 germany and switzerland been et al 2016 and slovakia mackuľak et al 2014 but lower than in netherlands and particularly than amsterdam one of the highest cannabis consumption in europe ort et al 2014 score 2020 thomas et al 2012 in contrast to the other studied drugs no clear geographical patterns have been observed for cannabis use in the different european cities with similar values in smaller towns than in larger cities in a wider analysis cannabis consumption in valencia was higher than in different cities of colombia bijlsma et al 2016 and costa rica andrés costa et al 2017 but similar to the one reported in a community in the midwestern united states skees et al 2018 despite the highest use prevalence of tobacco among the european population it should be highlighted that very few wbe studies focussed on its consumption have been published results of a study performed in four cities of spain bilbao vitoria gasteiz castellon and santiago de compostela and two of portugal porto and vila do conde reported similar tobacco consumption to valencia estévez danta et al 2022 on the other hand the consumption of nicotine performed in lithuania was estimated by using the metabolites cot cot oh and comparison with data calculated in this study is not straightforward boogaerts et al 2021 4 2 2 cocaine in this study significant differences in the estimated cocaine consumption were found depending on the use of the parent compound or its metabolites thus by using coc the results were significantly higher than those of becg cocet and ecme p 0 05 this result is not in agreement with those of colombia and costa rica where the cocaine consumption showed differences becg coc andrés costa et al 2017 bijlsma et al 2016 or in brussels van nuijs et al 2011b where it was the same becg ecme supporting the idea of deliberate or accidental disposal of the drug into valencia s sewer stated above in general studies reporting all cocaine metabolites concentrations finally select becg for calculation because of its higher stability compared to other cocaine residues andrés costa et al 2017 da silva et al 2018 mackuľak et al 2014 nefau et al 2013 table s9 cocaine consumption calculated from becg concentration in valencia was similar than in barcelona mastroianni et al 2017 as concluded also by the esar net network esar net 2020 in the study of bijlsma et al cocaine consumption was calculated in 17 spanish cities in 2021 finding values in the range of g day 1000inh in valencia castellon reus and palma de mallorca positioning spanish cities at the top of the cocaine consumer markets bijlsma et al 2021 esar net 2020 oeda 2021 the international wastewater monitoring campaigns performed yearly by score report together with a number of publications gonzález mariño et al 2020 mackuľak et al 2014 ort et al 2014 score 2020 have demonstrated a clear geographical difference in the consumption of cocaine with higher use in southern and western europe the record 213 t of cocaine seized in 2019 indicates an expanding supply in the eu cocaine purity has been increasing over the last decade and the numbers of people entering treatment for the first time have risen over the last 5 years among the 26 countries reporting surveys 2015 2020 last year prevalence of cocaine use among young adults 15 34 was 0 2 4 6 with 8 countries reporting rates over 2 5 emcdda 2021 average cocaine use in valencia was higher than that observed in main cities from northern and eastern european countries as finland germany switzerland lithuania and slovakia been et al 2016 boogaerts et al 2021 kankaanpää et al 2016 mackuľak et al 2014 close to those of brussels van nuijs et al 2011b and several cities of france nefau et al 2013 it was also of the same order of magnitude than countries of america as costa rica andrés costa et al 2017 usa bishop et al 2020 skees et al 2018 and colombia bijlsma et al 2016 known as one to the main cocaine producing countries in the world but lower than in brazil da silva et al 2018 in most of these studies it has been demonstrated that the consumption of cocaine is higher in larger cities compared to smaller towns the calculated consumption of cocaine during 3 months in guangzhou china was two orders of magnitude lower zhang et al 2019 than those of europe or america demonstrating that cocaine is not a popular illicit drug in this county in africa the only country reporting cocaine consumption data is south africa and these can also be considered low archer et al 2018 in the same range to those reported in australia lai et al 2016 4 2 3 amphetamine type stimulants this group of drugs is the second most consumed in valencia city and surrounding towns the fluctuations observed in amphetamine and methamphetamine consumptions fig 1 can reflect changes in the market with consumers using one substance or the other depending on availability at a national level amphetamine consumption in valencia table 1 was lower than in barcelona mastroianni et al 2017 and bilbao bijlsma et al 2021 as reported by the 2021 european drug report and several studies amphetamine methamphetamine are the drugs most consumed in north central and east europe respectively bijlsma et al 2021 emcdda 2021 mackuľak et al 2014 for amphetamine the highest consumptions have been reported in denmark norway iceland and especially belgium and netherlands which exceed by far the means found in the rest of the continent gonzález mariño et al 2020 ort et al 2014 score 2020 thomas et al 2012 van nuijs et al 2011b table s9 comparatively consumptions measured in southern european cities were much lower as those reported for valencia and several cities in france nefau et al 2013 although the average use of methamphetamine in europe is low when compared to other stimulants some important hotspots have been identified mostly in eastern and northern countries as there is a market expansion from the east to north and central europe gonzález mariño et al 2020 ort et al 2014 methamphetamine consumption in valencia was lower than in other investigated cities as barcelona mastroianni et al 2017 slovakia one of highest methamphetamine consumption rates in europe mackuľak et al 2014 finland lithuania germany and switzerland been et al 2016 boogaerts et al 2021 kankaanpää et al 2016 but higher than in cities of italy zuccato et al 2016 and belgium van nuijs et al 2011b amphetamine and methamphetamine were not detected in colombia bijlsma et al 2016 and in several cities of spain e g castellon guadalajara lleida toledo where it seems that their consumption is very low and not largely extended bijlsma et al 2021 estévez danta et al 2022 in other continents methamphetamine consumption in south africa archer et al 2018 guangzhou and other chinese cities du et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 as well as in australia lai et al 2016 was much higher than in valencia which was similar to the consumption in five cities of south korea kim et al 2015 amphetamine and methamphetamine consumptions showed the highest levels found in literature in the united states skees et al 2018 in contrast to cocaine use the difference in amphetamine and methamphetamine consumptions between smaller towns and bigger cities within a country is less clear gonzález mariño et al 2020 lai et al 2016 latest epidemiological indicators and wbe data point to a revival of mdma in europe in recent years emcdda 2021 esar net 2020 however a factor that could contribute to these higher values is the known increased content of mdma in ecstasy tablets since 2010 11 emcdda 2021 gonzález mariño et al 2020 in general spain is considered a low mdma usage country but wastewater data reported to emcdda indicates an increasing trend in its use over the years for the four cities participating in score and esar net i e barcelona castellon santiago de compostela and valencia bijlsma et al 2021 emcdda 2021 esar net 2020 estévez danta et al 2022 ecstasy s consumption in valencia table 1 was of the same order than in bilbao madrid and palma de mallorca higher than in castellon and toledo bijlsma et al 2021 but lower than in barcelona mastroianni et al 2017 the highest use of mdma has been observed in western european locations compared to northern and eastern europe ones gonzález mariño et al 2020 ort et al 2014 the ecstasy s use estimated here is similar than in other european cities as those of belgium van nuijs et al 2011b france nefau et al 2013 but higher than in italy finland slovakia germany and switzerland been et al 2016 kankaanpää et al 2016 mackuľak et al 2014 zuccato et al 2016 outside europe the use of mdma is generally low as in south american countries bijlsma et al 2016 or in guangzhou china where seizures of ecstasy tablets containing little or no mdma confirmed to low consumptions levels reported in south east and east asia zhang et al 2019 similar low consumption values have been reported for the first time in south africa archer et al 2018 and several states and territories in australia lai et al 2016 as cocaine mdma use is generally higher in larger cities compared to smaller towns gonzález mariño et al 2020 thomas et al 2012 ketamine is considered a dissociative anesthetic used in powdered or liquid form despite its original design as human and more commonly veterinary anesthetic ketamine has gained popularity as club drug over the past few years according to recent studies ketamine is among the emerging drugs used in bars and discos together with other synthetic drugs as lsd mdma phencyclidine and alkyl nitrites i e poppers bijlsma et al 2016 despite the fact that ketamine was only found in 40 of samples analysed the consumptions calculated in this study can indicate that its use is not sporadic and it has increased as drug of abuse in front of its use as pharmaceutical concentrations and or consumptions of this drug and its metabolite norketamine have been mainly reported in east and south east asia du et al 2015 suggesting its use particularly in this region as in guangzhou china where ketamine was the drug most consumed among the six substances monitored during 8 weeks in 2017 zhang et al 2019 ketamine consumption in valencia is higher than in other cities as those of colombia bijlsma et al 2016 4 2 4 opioids heroin consumption in this study was back calculated by means of the concentrations of mor and although therapeutic morphine should be differentiated from that one of the illicit drug this is not corrected here since it is advised only for countries where the licit contributions of morphine can be higher than those of illicit heroin khan and nicell 2011 gracia lor et al 2016 according to the eu report member states reported 26000 heroin seizures amounting to 7 9 t in 2019 with indexed trends showing that the average purity of heroin rose by 23 between 2009 and 2019 while its price dropped 17 emcdda 2021 these figures would help to explain consumption values calculated in valencia which were similar to those of different cities in italy reported using mor zuccato et al 2016 but also those using 6mam 6 monoacetylmorphine as in barcelona mastroianni et al 2017 these were higher than in germany and switzerland been et al 2016 or in finland where it is absent kankaanpää et al 2016 but lower than in brussels van nuijs et al 2011b table s9 outside europe heroin levels were very high in usa bishop et al 2020 skees et al 2018 in colombia they were too low to be detected bijlsma et al 2016 while in costa rica they were lower than in valencia causanilles et al 2017b similarly in south africa despite heroin is considered the most commonly abused opioid in the country it was not detected at any of the wwtws analysed in 2017 archer et al 2018 methadone consumption has shown high values in western europe in valencia it was estimated through eddp or meth concentrations resulting in lower values than in other places mainly calculated by using eddp as barcelona mastroianni et al 2017 brussels van nuijs et al 2011b and several cities in france nefau et al 2013 methadone consumption in different cities of usa was calculated using meth obtaining much higher levels than in this study bishop et al 2020 skees et al 2018 values reported for these cities are about 60 times higher than in guangzhou china zhang et al 2019 on the other hand codeine use in valencia can be considered high if it is compared with the values reported in cities of costa rica causanilles et al 2017b usa bishop et al 2020 skees et al 2018 china guangzhou zhang et al 2019 or south korea kim et al 2015 finally it is important to state that even following the best practice requirements for each of the steps proposed by different authors and the score network castiglioni et al 2013 score 2020 some uncertainty related to the sampling protocol measurement of the flow rate stability of the compounds in wastewater chemical analysis performed estimation of the population size and correction factors cfs applied in the back calculations is unavoidable and consequently the validity and reliability of the results obtained and subsequent estimations made in this study have to be taken with caution as stated by these authors the loss or formation of sewage drug biomarkers is generally lower than 10 negligible uncertainty if the mean residence time of sewage in the sewer systems is 0 5 15 h as in this study other factors as adsorption onto the solid particulate matter spm and the conjugation of drug residues are not important since percentages of adsorption are estimated to be coc 3 1 becg 0 5 amp 8 6 mdma 2 4 and meth 2 3 castiglioni et al 2013 however adsorption onto spm could be a relevant issue for cannabis due to its low polarity and therefore our values for cannabis consumption could be underestimated to calculate the population size to normalize the data to the number of inhabitants served by each wwtp we have used real time calculations based on the cod 128 g day as suggested by different authors bijlsma et al 2016 causanilles et al 2017b van nuijs et al 2011b in relation to cfs this research has adopted the most recently refined and accepted cfs based on local data on the preferential route of administration to reduce wbe uncertainty and to improve comparability of the results within different studies castiglioni et al 2013 gracia lor et al 2016 thai et al 2016 however most of the literature summarised in this study used different cfs and consequently caution should paid with the comparisons made herein we have not presented our data in doses day 1000inh since it is a factor that adds additional uncertainty to the back calculated drug use values 4 3 temporal trends of drugs consumption and influence of local festivities in relation to temporal trends it can be stated that cannabis and cocaine consumption have increased in valencia city and surrounding towns comparing the values obtained in this study in 2018 2020 with those reported previously for 2011 2013 andrés costa et al 2014 although there are small differences in the cfs used in both researches consumptions were similar for methamphetamine decreased for amphetamine and increased for ecstasy which can also be associated to the higher mdma purity observed in last years gracia lor et al 2017 score 2020 ketamine consumption estimated for 2017 20 is significantly lower than the one reported for 2011 13 andrés costa et al 2014 but this is related to different cfs used heroin in the previous study could not be calculated by means of 6 mam compared to this one in which it was calculated through mor showing low consumptions as methadone that was not reported in 2011 13 for valencia andrés costa et al 2014 cannabis consumption remarkably increased also in barcelona between 2011 and 2015 mastroianni et al 2017 increasing trends have also been reported in italy in 2010 14 zuccato et al 2016 the increased cocaine consumption values in valencia city and surrounding towns agrees with the general tendency observed across europe within the last years gonzález mariño et al 2020 zuccato et al 2016 although this can be explained by a higher prevalence of cocaine use or a similar number of consumers using a higher amount of drug it can also be related to an increased drug purity 32 54 from 2009 to 2016 emcdda 2021 according to the emccd of the 49 cities that have data on cocaine residues in municipal wastewater for 2019 and 2020 19 reported an increase 14 a stable situation and 16 a decrease the most recent data indicate that cocaine is becoming more common in cities in the east of europe although detection levels remain low emcdda 2021 score 2020 fluctuations detected for amphetamine and methamphetamine levels during the study period fig 1 have also been observed in barcelona where an increasing trend was observed within 2011 15 then it seems to be stabilized or even slightly decreased in most recent years mastroianni et al 2017 in the eu of the 48 cities with data on amphetamine residues in municipal wastewater for 2019 and 2020 20 reported an increase 9 a stable situation and 19 a decrease emcdda 2021 on the other hand methamphetamine use in barcelona increased considerably since 2011 as in some cities of finland and switzerland where considerable increases were measured for 2014 17 bijlsma et al 2021 gonzález mariño et al 2020 kankaanpää et al 2016 of the 50 cities that have data on methamphetamine residues in municipal wastewater for 2019 and 2020 15 reported an increase 14 a stable situation and 21 a decrease bijlsma et al 2021 emcdda 2021 among the countries consistently providing data on purity and price the average purity of amphetamine has increased markedly over the past decade while the price has remained relatively stable whereas the overall average purity and price of methamphetamine in 2019 were comparable to the values reported in 2009 emcdda 2021 outside europe methamphetamine and ketamine use 2012 14 in several chinese cities were reported to significantly increase and decrease respectively du et al 2015 recently consumption of both drugs was detected to be reduced in guangzhou china from may to october 2017 and explained because of a series of law enforcement anti narcotics operations that destroyed several large scale transnational channels of methamphetamine trafficking zhang et al 2019 declining consumptions of methamphetamine 14 per year and ketamine were reported in a city in southern china 2012 18 zheng et al 2021 mdma underwent an intermittent upsurge in europe during 2011 17 gonzález mariño et al 2020 while it was stable over the period 2012 18 in china zheng et al 2021 of the 49 cities that have data on mdma residues in municipal wastewater in 2019 20 18 reported an increase 7 a stable situation and 24 a decrease emcdda 2021 among these cities mdma use has increased in finland germany and switzerland been et al 2016 kankaanpää et al 2016 but particularly in amsterdam likely reflecting its position as a tourism and nightlife destination the average annual use of heroin in barcelona 2011 15 in several cities of italy 2010 14 and in china 2012 18 showed a decreasing trend mastroianni et al 2017 zheng et al 2021 zuccato et al 2016 although with some fluctuations methadone was stable over the period 2012 18 in china zhang et al 2019 zheng et al 2021 and codeine in guangzhou during 3 months in 2017 zhang et al 2019 4 3 1 weekly patterns of drugs use in valencia city weekly patterns of drugs use were deduced by the changes observed in their concentrations at the inlet of wwtps confirming the recreational character of some of these substances in valencia city and its surrounding towns three drugs namely cocaine ecstasy and heroin showed a weekly trend with significantly higher consumption values during the weekend compared to the weekdays the first two were expected because of their popularity in the dance and music scene but the higher use of heroin was unexpected although positive detections in samples collected in barcelona from friday to monday suggest a comparable pattern mastroianni et al 2017 similar results were already reported in valencia in 2011 13 but instead of heroin amphetamine was reported andrés costa et al 2014 other european cities ort et al 2014 thomas et al 2012 including those of belgium van nuijs et al 2011b france nefau et al 2013 italy zuccato et al 2016 and slovakia mackuľak et al 2014 together with some in south america as brazil da silva et al 2018 africa as south africa archer et al 2018 and oceania as australia lai et al 2016 highlighted also the higher use of drugs such as amphetamine cocaine and ecstasy during weekends indicating that the consumption of these drugs is associated with recreational and socializing purposes worth mentioning is the case of barcelona where mdma consumption was duplicated during weekends reaching maxima on sunday 251 31 g day mastroianni et al 2017 in valencia city the significant higher use of mdma friday to sunday is shifted with one day compared with cocaine thursday to sunday which can be due to different usage trends of both illicit drugs but also to differences in the excretion patterns maximal concentrations in urine half lives van nuijs et al 2011b tobacco cannabis amphetamine methamphetamine ketamine methadone and codeine concentrations were relatively constant throughout the week as it has been observed previously in valencia andrés costa et al 2014 and other european cities nefau et al 2013 ort et al 2014 thomas et al 2012 zuccato et al 2016 but also in colombia bogota and medellin for cannabis bijlsma et al 2016 and in guangzhou for methamphetamine ketamine methadone and codeine zhang et al 2019 the lack of weekend effect for amphetamine can be due to the fact that is also legally used in the treatment of several disorders narcolepsy and adhd and it is also a metabolite of several pharmaceuticals fenethylline fenproporex and selegiline van nuijs et al 2011b as for methadone that is prescribed for a daily intake van nuijs et al 2011b 4 3 2 impact of the main local festivity in the drugs use of valencia city finally significant increases in the consumption of cocaine amphetamine methamphetamine and mainly mdma were observed during las fallas in 2014 fig 3 cocaine amphetamine and methamphetamine consumption were almost doubled but the highest growth was detected for the mdma which was around four times higher a previous study has already reported the increased use of alcohol during these festivities andrés costa et al 2016 similar results have been reported in different festivals special events or holiday periods in different cities of the world in slovakia mackuľak et al 2014 higher consumption of methamphetamine 163 mg day 1000inh and cocaine up to 1800 mg day 1000inh were measured in the lodenica country and folk music festival ecstasy consumption was festival dependent with an extremely high use during the music festival in trenčín whereas no significant increase in the cannabis consumption was found during the two music festivals in brussels the highest level of cocaine use was observed on new year s eve 1544 mg day 1000inh christmas period 1063 mg day 1000inh and during easter holiday 1032 1048 mg day 1000inh van nuijs et al 2011b mdma s peak use was observed at new year s eve and around easter 286 and 144 mg day 1000inh respectively in amsterdam high ecstasy s consumption values estimated were related to a big halloween dance party van der aa et al 2013 outside europe a significantly higher consumption of methamphetamine 42 and cocaine 47 was observed during the spring festival week of guangzhou china compared with the control period similarly higher mean consumption 37 of mdma was observed during national day holidays in brazil a significant high cocaine use was observed in the carnival day of 2018 6229 mg day 1000inh being one of the highest reported in the literature da silva et al 2018 5 conclusion wbe methodology was successfully applied to assess the occurrence and tendencies of various licit and illicit drugs in valencia city and surrounding towns during one two weeks between 2011 and 2020 consumption estimates indicate that cannabis tobacco and cocaine are the most consumed drugs in the study area temporal trends were difficult to evaluate but it seems that drug use increased since 2018 which is in agreement with the official statistics in the region consumption of cocaine amphetamine and mdma was found to be higher during the weekends confirming the recreational purposes of these drugs similarly during las fallas main local festivity increased use of cocaine and amphetamine type stimulants mainly mdma was measured results of this research highlights the relevance of wbe which can complement classic epidemiological indicators e g prevalence data and seizures statistics to jointly draw a more comprehensive picture of the drug use patterns in valencia city wbe estimates allowed us to evaluate data on drug use in a specific region in an objective fast inexpensive and anonymous way in relation to the uncertainties associated to this approach the current cfs need to be updated and harmonized to be used as part of the best practice protocol annual more intensive sampling 1week is also advised to assess temporal variations more clearly wbe is an extremely flexible tool for application at different spatial and temporal scales which can help us to get more insight on the tendencies on licit and illicit drugs consumption and the changes derived from local festivities declaration of

14727,uranium extraction from seawater has become a crucial issue that has raised tremendous attention the transport of water molecules along with salt ions through an ion exchange membrane is a common phenomenon for typical electro membrane processes such as selective electrodialysis sed in this study a cascade electro dehydration process was proposed for the simultaneous extraction and enrichment of uranium from simulated seawater by taking advantage of water transport through ion exchange membranes and the high permselectivity of membranes for monovalent ions against uranate ions the results indicated that the electro dehydration effect in sed allowed 1 8 times the concentration of uranium with a loose structure cjmc 5 cation exchange membrane at a current density of 4 ma cm2 thereafter a cascade electro dehydration by a combination of sed with conventional electrodialysis ced enabled approximately 7 5 times uranium concentration with the extraction yield rate reaching over 80 and simultaneously desalting the majority of salts overall a cascade electro dehydration is a viable approach creating a novel route for highly effective uranium extraction and enrichment from

the granary of nuclear energy has been in tremendous demand and plays an important strategic role in the long term and safe development of nuclear power kahouli 2011 it is estimated that the ocean contains 4 5 billion tons of uranium which is also the largest resource of uranium reserves uranium extraction from seawater has attracted tremendous attention because of the dual considerations of energy demand and environmental protection davies et al 1964 on the one hand mining uranium ore on land usually discharges a large volume of wastewater leading to a variety of health and environmental hazards in addition the extraction of uranium from land is usually accompanied by complex mechanical mining procedures and high capital and operating costs chouyyok et al 2016 parker et al 2018 on the other hand the majority of uranium resources are stored in seawater which is approximately 1000 times the amount of known uranium deposits on land resources he et al 2021 wiechert et al 2022 therefore considering the scarcity and strategic value of uranium resources the extraction of uranium from seawater deserves increasing attention from academia and industry to provide sufficient and reliable nuclear energy tsouris 2017 davies et al first formally proposed the technology of uranium extraction from seawater in the 1960s which has received increasing attention since then davies et al 1964 uranium extraction from seawater has been recognized as one of seven chemical separations to change the world which would reap great global benefits if improved sholl and lively 2016 nevertheless according to the general process of uranium extraction from seawater as shown in fig 1 seawater is a highly complicated mixture solution containing high strength and diverse ionic species which has severely hampered uranium extraction kim et al 2013 meanwhile another major challenge is that the concentration of uranium in seawater is extremely infinitesimal only approximately 3 3 ppb liu et al 2017 to date several technologies have been developed for uranium extraction of which physical adsorption is considered a promising method in particular functionalized polymer sorbents with chelated amidoxime groups have been extensively investigated for uranium extraction li et al 2021 luo et al 2019 wang et al 2022b xu et al 2019 yan et al 2020 however the physical adsorption method usually has unavoidable drawbacks from the inferior adsorption efficiency and adsorption capacity the large excess of competing ions and poor permselectivity of sorbents significantly decrease the adsorbent ability of uranium chi et al 2018 in addition some uranium uptake needs reduction by related processes li et al 2019 song et al 2022 zhang et al 2019 the physical adsorption method also suffers from adverse regeneration performance and high operating costs which limit its large scale application in actual sea trials tang et al 2020 selective electrodialysis sed is an electro driven membrane separation technology that is developed on the basis of conventional electrodialysis ced the specific characteristic of sed is that monovalent ion permselective membranes are assembled in the membrane stack which can fractionate and enrich monovalent ions against di or multivalent ions rehman et al 2021 yan et al 2022 in 2012 sed was initially proposed for the separation of nacl and na2so4 and the recovery disposal of phosphorus resources zhang et al 2012 henceforth numerous studies have focused on the development of this superior separation and enrichment technique for precise ion fractionation such as lithium extraction from salt lakes qiu et al 2019 wu et al 2022 recycling salt resources waste acid valorization and others chen et al 2021b wei et al 2022 ye et al 2019 zhang et al 2013 compared with other membrane technologies such as ced and nanofiltration sed can not only achieve the fractionation of monovalent ions from the mixed solution but also the enrichment of monovalent ions in addition the low operating pressure and high hydrophilic properties of ion exchange membranes facilitate the tolerance of sed technology to membrane fouling rendering this technology easily compatible and integrated with other separation units rehman et al 2021 overall sed provides the possibility for uranium extraction from seawater due to its functions of selective separation and enrichment however few studies have investigated uranium extraction from seawater via this promising method in fact the species of uranium in seawater are extremely complex that are correlated to the ionic strength concentration and ph endrizzi et al 2016 favre réguillon et al 2008 notably the main species of uranium in real seawater exists as anionic triscarbonato uranate namely uo2 co3 3 4 vi as a consequence it is possible to utilize sed for uranium extraction considering the large sized and multivalent nature of the uranate ion endrizzi and rao 2014 xie et al 2023 fig 2 demonstrates the schematic principle of the sed for uranium extraction from simulated seawater specifically under the influence of the current field monovalent ions predominantly cl will be isolated from seawater while multi valency uo2 co3 3 4 anions will be retarded by monovalent perm selective anion exchange membranes meanwhile na will be transported toward the cathode migrate across the cation exchange membranes and finally combine with cl to maintain charge neutrality as a result it is possible to extract uranium from seawater using the sed approach notably ion transport across the ion exchange membrane is usually accomplished in a hydrated state aliaskari and schäfer 2021 the transport of water molecules along with salts through an ion exchange membrane is a common phenomenon for typical electro membrane processes such as ced and sed van linden et al 2019 in most cases water transport is an undesirable phenomenon because it will decrease the concentration performance of monovalent ions notably in this study the transport phenomenon of water molecules from the dilute chamber to the concentrate chamber clarified as the electro dehydration effect is utilized for the simultaneous extraction and enrichment of the uranate ions in this article we proposed a novel electro dehydration process for the simultaneous extraction and enrichment of uranium from simulated seawater by taking advantage of water transport through ion exchange membranes and the high permselectivity of membranes for monovalent ions against uranate ions the membrane type and operating current density were systematically investigated to enlarge the electro dehydration effect thereafter sed was integrated with the traditional physical adsorption method illustrating the benefits of desalination of the majority of salts in the electro dehydration effect furthermore a cascade electro dehydration process was developed by combining sed with ced the effluent from sed containing uranate ions was further concentrated with ced and then subjected to the next batch of sed creating the possibility for cascade extraction and concentration the cascade electro dehydration process in the sed ced integration operation realized concurrent uranium extraction and enrichment the high enrichment times 7 5 times and satisfactorily selective desalting performance prove the high viability of the electro dehydration effect for highly effective uranium extraction from seawater 2 experimental 2 1 materials the cation exchange membranes used for the experiments were cjmc 5 heifei chemjoy polymer materials co ltd china twedc shandong tianwei membrane technology co ltd china and cm 2 astom co ltd japan the monovalent perm selective anion exchange membranes used for the experiment were asa astom co ltd japan the main properties of all the membranes are listed in table 1 nacl 25 6 g l nahco3 193 mg l and a uranium standard solution 3 mg l were prepared for the experiments to obtain simulated seawater containing uranium additionally naoh was used to regulate the ph of the solution at approximately 8 which is consistent with the ph of real seawater all chemicals used were analytical grade and purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china deionized water was used throughout the experiments 2 2 experimental procedures a self assembled setup for the sed experiments provided by hefei chemjoy polymer materials co ltd china was used for the experiments a direct current power supply hspy 60 10 beijing hanshengpuyuan science and technology co ltd china provided a driving force for uranium extraction connected to two electrodes on both sides of the sed stack the asa and cation exchange membranes each membrane size of 110 mm 270 mm with an effective area of 189 cm2 were alternately arranged between the anode and cathode to form three chambers namely the dilute chamber the concentrate chamber and the electrode chamber the solution corresponding to each chamber was simulated seawater containing uranium 1000 ml the same concentration as 25 6 g l nacl 200 ml and 0 3 mol l na2so4 500 ml respectively the silicone partition net thickness 0 8 mm was installed between two neighboring membranes to separate two neighboring chambers with the flow channels each chamber circulated the streams to form circulating loops and prevent the occurrence of concentration polarization by a peristaltic pump bt600 l baoding lead fluid technology co ltd china at a linear velocity of 3 cm s initially the operation parameters of the sed that is membrane type and current density were optimized to enhance the effects of uranium extraction from simulated seawater specifically three kinds of typical and commonly used cation exchange membranes that is cm 2 twedc and cjmc 5 were used to choose the most suitable membrane for high efficiency uranium extraction from seawater the current density was chosen in the range of 4 10 ma cm2 to evaluate the effect of the sed on the performance of uranium extraction from seawater in addition the volume ratio of initial concentrate to dilute was defined as 200 ml 1000 ml in each batch experiment the conductivity of the dilute and concentrate solutions was monitored using a conductivity meter dds 307 shanghai inesa scientific instrument co ltd china one batch sed experiment ended when the conductivity decreased to 5 ms cm with the dilute stream furthermore based on the optimization of sed operating parameters the feasibility and potential of integrating the sed with others were illustrated via the traditional physical adsorption method which also proved the benefits of desalination of the majority of salts in the electro dehydration effect then a cascade electro dehydration process was investigated by combining sed with ced simulated seawater containing uranium was consecutively treated via sed and ced to selectively extract and concentrate uranate ions significantly to be specific the effluent stream containing uranium after treatment by sed was subjected to ced and the resultant concentrate stream in ced was further introduced to sed 2 3 analysis and data calculation in each batch of experiments the conductivity and the voltage drop changes during the experiment were recorded the samples were taken at certain intervals of time for concentration analysis the concentration of uranium was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp oes optima 7300dv perkin elmer corporation the concentration of chloride ions was determined using an automatic potentiometric titrator zdj 4b shanghai oushtuer industrial co ltd china which was used to titrate through a standard silver nitrate solution the uranium enrichment times c e were calculated as li et al 2022 1 c e c u n d t c u n d 0 100 where c u n d 0 ppm and c u n d t ppm are the concentrations of uranium in the dilute chamber at times 0 and t respectively the water transport ω was calculated using eq 2 yan et al 2019 2 w v d 0 v d t v d 0 100 where v d 0 l and v d t l are the volumes of the dilute solution at times 0 and t respectively the leakage rate of uranium l was calculated using

al 2020 8 y c u n d t v d t c u n d 0 v d 0 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 selection of membranes to enlarge the electro dehydration effect the performance of the sed is directly determined by the properties of ion exchange membranes various ion exchange membranes are fabricated by different polymer skeletons and functional group structures which results in different electro dehydration performances of the sed xu 2005 in this study a dense anion exchange membrane with high permselectivity for monovalent anions that is asa was used for the selective separation of uranium and univalent anions additionally three types of commercial cation exchange membranes cm 2 twedc and cjmc 5 were used to evaluate the uranium enrichment performance in the sed process moreover all sed processes were implemented in a constant current mode and the current density was identified as 10 ma cm2 the initial volume ratio between concentrate and dilute was defined as 200 ml 1000 ml fig 3 shows the effect of three kinds of cation exchange membranes on uranium enrichment in the sed as shown in fig 3a the voltage drops always maintained an upward trend with the operating time specifically there was a slow increase followed by a rapid rise in the later stage which was closely related to the membrane stack resistance consisting of solution resistance and membrane resistance yan et al 2022 in general membrane resistance is almost a steady trend in the sed process however the solution resistance gradually increased with time under a constant current mode this was mainly attributed to the decrease in the concentration of nacl caused by the migration of salt from the dilute chamber to the concentrate chamber as shown in fig 3b galama et al 2014 simultaneously there was a significant gap in the values of the voltage drops which was mainly ascribed to the membrane resistances themselves furthermore the voltage drops of the three kinds of membranes presented a trend of twedc cjmc 5 cm 2 as shown in table 1 this trend was consistent with the resistances of the chosen membranes that is the higher the membrane resistance the higher the corresponding voltage value due to ohm s law especially in the later stage as the salt content decreased to the same level at an identical current density suggesting the same solution resistance wang et al 2020 moreover compared with cm 2 and twedc cjmc 5 took more time to reach the endpoint of the sed experiment resulting in a lower desalination efficiency as shown in fig 3b and table 2 this could be ascribed to the inherent characteristics of membranes with different thicknesses transport numbers area resistances ion exchange capacities etc ran et al 2017 water transport is a common phenomenon for a typical electro membrane process such as sed which is primarily attributed to concentration gradient osmosis and electro osmosis the former is caused by the concentration gradient difference between the dilute and concentrate chambers zhou et al 2018 in our case there was no significant discrepancy in the concentration gradient difference for the three investigated cation exchange membranes therefore the water transport caused by the concentration gradient was not pronounced the difference in water transport for the three kinds of membranes was mainly attributed to the electro osmosis effect zhou et al 2018 the hydrated na and cl ions migrated from the dilute to the concentrate chamber driven by an electric field force causing a substantial decrease in the volume in the dilute chamber notably the electro osmosis of water molecules through an ion exchange membrane depends on the nature of the membrane a membrane with a dense structure and small free volume size allows the transport of a few water molecules during the migration of hydrated ions across the membrane lu et al 2011 rottiers et al 2014 as shown in fig 3d the cm 2 and twedc membranes obtained almost the same water transport the water transport of cjmc 5 reached 19 3 which was higher than that of the two membranes meanwhile fig 3c indicated that the uranium enrichment times of cjmc 5 could be up to 1 3 times which was superior to the other two kinds of membranes this phenomenon was attributed to the fact that cjmc 5 had loose polymer skeleton structure and longer running time to facilitate the electro dehydration effect as a consequence the cjmc 5 membrane exhibited the best uranium enrichment performance by desalting the majority of salts traditionally electrodialysis with ion exchange membranes has been extensively applied for desalination and concentration while a loose structure ion exchange membrane is usually considered an undesired membrane structure interestingly in this study the electro dehydration effect was enhanced with a loose structure cjmc 5 membrane the high hydration ability of a loose structure membrane caused the osmosis of water molecules migrating from the dilute into the concentrate chamber during the desalination process leading to the concentration of uranate ions it is also noted that the cost of a loose structure membrane is relatively low because of the uncomplicated preparation routes with little use of crosslinking agents wang et al 2022a hence the usage of the cjmc 5 cation exchange membrane could turn weakness into strength leading to the separation and enrichment of uranium preferably with low operating cost unfortunately it can be seen from fig 3d and table 2 that the membrane of cjmc 5 also witnessed a higher uranium leakage rate and a lower permselectivity due to its looser membrane structure and longer running time compared with the dense membranes of cm 2 and twedc in summary from the viewpoint of uranium separation and enrichment the cjmc 5 membrane achieved 1 3 times enrichment performance with 19 3 water transport by taking advantage of the electro dehydration effect in the sed process this cation exchange membrane was also chosen for further experiments 3 2 effect of the current density during the sed process the current density is a crucial factor for the separation performance which directly affects desalination efficiency and water transport chen et al 2018 therefore it is necessary for an appropriate current density to enlarge the electro dehydration effect for uranium extraction and enrichment in this study current densities ranging from 4 ma cm2 to 10 ma cm2 were investigated based on the above experiments the cation exchange membrane of cjmc 5 and the anion exchange membrane of asa were applied with an initial volume ratio between the concentrate and dilute chamber of 200 ml 1000 ml the voltage drops as a function of time is indicated in fig 4 a the voltage drops increased with an increase in current density which was consistent with ohm s law as mentioned above it was undoubtedly logical that the higher the current density the higher the values of voltage with a relatively constant stack resistance when the sed stack was in a steady state wang et al 2020 additionally as the sed experiment progressed the voltage drops demonstrated an increasing trend with the elapse of time as mentioned earlier meanwhile the concentration of nacl decreased steadily with the operating time until the conductivity of the dilute solution decreased to 5 ms cm as shown in fig 4b which also revealed that the sed experiments acquired a satisfactory desalination performance furthermore as the current density increased the running time of the sed was shortened dramatically thus it was inevitable that a high current density allowed for higher desalination efficiency as shown in table 3 fig 4c illustrates the effect of the current density on uranium enrichment times it was obvious that the current density had a significant effect on uranium enrichment performance to be specific the concentrations of uranium for one batch sed experiment continued to increase with prolonged time which was caused by water transport of hydrated ions and water molecules from the dilute chamber to the concentrate chamber as shown in fig 4d as the current density increased from 4 to 10 ma cm2 the water transport was 43 6 32 0 25 9 and 19 3 respectively additionally the corresponding uranium enrichment times reached maxima of 1 8 1 6 1 4 and 1 3 respectively therefore it was found that a lower current density was more conducive to a further increase in uranium concentration in the dilute stream this might be attributed to the fact that a lower current density prolonged the running time of the sed experiment which accelerated water transport observably the effect of electro osmosis on water transport was almost identical for all current densities because of the similar desalination rate in each experiment therefore the water transport rate increased with decreasing current density primarily because more water molecules migrated from the dilute chamber to the concentrate chamber over a longer period of time zhou et al 2018 meanwhile it was also further confirmed that the splendid electro dehydration effect caused by low current density enabled uranium extraction nevertheless although low current density played an essential role in improving the uranium enrichment effect there were still negative impacts except for low desalination efficiency it was also accompanied by a relatively high leakage rate which was ascribed to the low current density having a weak electric field driving force this resulted in hydrated ions taking more time to achieve ion migration from the dilute chamber to the concentrate chamber compared to the high current density moreover the monovalent perm selective anion exchange membranes have relatively superior interception performances of high valence anions while it is not 100 interception completely so that the uranium would leak into the concentrate chamber thus with prolonged running time in the sed process the uranium leakage rate also increased due to the accumulation of slightly migrated uranium quantities furthermore in regard to the permselectivity exhibited in fig 4d it could be found that a high current density obtained admirable results on account of the uranium leakage rate it was logical that there was a trade off effect between enrichment times and the permselectivity of uranium which should be systematically considered and negotiated in practical applications based on lab level basic research we may pursue higher uranium enrichment times which urges choosing a low current density however extraction efficiency and uranium quality are considered in actual sea trials obviously a higher current density would be applicable with a shorter time and higher permselectivity furthermore the appropriate voltage and plenty of repeat units may be more favorable to industrial and large scale uranium extraction from seawater for convenience and economy in addition more excellent monovalent perm selective anion exchange membranes have been utilized with the deepening of scientific research which also ameliorates the trade off effect in summary even though a low current density had shortcomings in the uranium leakage rate it facilitated satisfactorily efficient uranium extraction performances by simultaneously ensuring a high desalination effect via the electro dehydration effect to enlarge a high electro dehydration effect in the sed process the current density was optimized as 4 ma cm2 where the enrichment times could maximally reach 1 8 times with a water transport rate of 43 6 3 3 a cascade electro dehydration with the integration of sed according to the experimental results previously described it is acknowledged that the electro dehydration effect in sed allowed one step separation and enrichment of uranium from simulated seawater however the electro osmosis of hydrated ions played a major role in water transport which was unable to be changed by tuning the parameters of membrane type and current density yan et al 2019 as a consequence the optimization of operating parameters in one batch sed experiment had limitations for uranium extraction to further increase the uranium extraction performance a cascade electro dehydration process was developed by combining sed with ced specifically the effluent from sed containing uranate ions was further concentrated with ced and then subjected to the next batch of sed the feasibility and potential of a cascade electro dehydration process will be evaluated 3 3 1 potential benefits of electro dehydration for uranium adsorption the electro dehydration effect achieved uranium enrichment and simultaneously desalted the majority of salts it is necessary to explore the impact of desalination on uranium extraction performance the physical adsorption method is the predominant method used for uranium extraction from seawater the uranium adsorption performances from simulated seawater between treatment with sed by introducing the electro dehydration effect and without any treatment were compared the physical adsorption experiment was conducted with 717 anion exchange resin of the chlorine type and three aqueous solutions i e simulated seawater containing uranium initial feed treated effluent at 4 ma cm2 treated 1 and treated effluent at 10 ma cm2 treated 2 were compared and tested specifically the volume of feed solution for the physical adsorption experiment was 40 ml the anion exchange resin weight was 2 g and static adsorption was carried out for approximately 48 hours the adsorption capacity and adsorption efficiency were calculated to evaluate the uranium adsorption performances which also enabled us to further confirm the functions of the sed fig 5 demonstrates that the adsorption efficiency and adsorption capacity of the three kinds of feed solutions changed over time the values of q and e for the three solutions increased with the progress of static adsorption while the effluents treated with sed obtained higher values compared with the initial simulated seawater containing uranium specifically the values of q increased by approximately 4 times for the adsorption capacity the value of e with the initial feed reached approximately 30 as the adsorption time was prolonged in contrast the value of e reached nearly 100 after the sed treatment which increased by approximately 3 times in addition the simulated seawater containing uranium treated by sed required a shorter time to the adsorption endpoint that had the maximum adsorption capacity and the highest adsorption efficiency in conclusion the desalination of the majority salts by introducing the electro dehydration effect could enhance the uranium adsorption capacity and adsorption efficiency which provides the possibility of the practical application of the sed technique for uranium extraction from real seawater 3 3 2 a cascade electro dehydration by combining sed and ced ultimately a cascade electro dehydration by combining sed and ced was developed to further enhance the uranium extraction performance a schematic diagram of the multiprocess integration of sed with ced is shown in fig 2b specifically seawater containing uranium was applied to the sed stack by taking advantage of the electro dehydration effect allowing uranium extraction in the dilute stream then the dilute effluent was divided into two streams and further fed into the ced stack for concentration according to a certain volume ratio finally the concentrate effluent of the ced was further subjected to the next sed as a consequence cascade isolation and concentration of uranium could be obtained by a combination of sed and ced integration experiments for industrial uranium extraction from seawater the uranium enrichment rate and handling capacity can be reasonably expanded by increasing the coupling number however due to the limited treating capacity in the first sed stack only a three stage sed ced sed experiment was carried out to evaluate the feasibility of the cascade electro dehydration effect fig 6 indicates the uranium extraction and concentration performance in a cascade electro dehydration process by a three stage sed ced sed coupling experiment as shown in fig 6a the voltage drops including sed and ced presented an increasing trend with time the decrease in conductivity resulted in an increase in the resistance of the solution in the dilute chamber this phenomenon was consistent with the results presented above galama et al 2014 in addition compared with the sed the voltage drops in the ced increased more sharply this is attributed to the fact that the solution resistance increased sharply in the dilute stream in the later stage of the ced experiment in regard to the nacl concentration as shown in fig 6b the salt contents substantially decreased at the end of the 1st sed and 3rd sed operation while the nacl concentration during the 2nd ced exhibited the opposite phenomenon in that the concentration of nacl increased with time thus it was obvious that the sed was more appropriate to be operated at the end of the cascade electro dehydration process to obtain a low salinity effluent containing uranium from the aspect of uranium enrichment as shown in fig 6c the uranium enrichment times increased steadily with time elapsed this phenomenon was also confirmed by the water transport data in fig 6d specifically a superior electro dehydration effect indicated by high water transport occurred in the 1st sed and the 3rd sed which was favorable for uranium enrichment as mentioned above low water transport contributed to the concentration of uranium in the ced process which was beneficial to the migration of uranium into the concentrate chamber in the 2nd ced experiment the appropriate water transport rate was only 4 1 which was much worse than that of the sed due to utilizing dense ion exchange membranes to carry out the ced experiment nevertheless the implementation of 2nd ced allowed a substantial increase in uranium enrichment times higher than 6 however there was still a drawback that the ced concentrated both uranium and other salts therefore the sed played a dual role in uranium separation and enrichment while the ced only played a role in uranium enrichment in this study the uranium was concentrated to approximately 22 ppm the enrichment times reached approximately 7 5 times and the yield of uranium enabled over 80 after a three stage sed ced sed coupling operation considering all the operations of uranium extraction a techno economic analysis of the cascade electro dehydration by combining sed and ced was performed for the uranium extraction process to demonstrate its economic feasibility it should be noted that the techno economic analysis is based on the actual performance data of the laboratory unit under experimental conditions because the operating conditions and process capacity will affect the techno economic evaluation according to the calculation results in table 4 the total techno economic cost was 101 78 m3 which mainly consisted of the total energy cost and investment cost according to the calculation results it was obvious that the most expensive part of this process was the investment cost among which the peripheral equipment cost was the most expensive of course as the scale of the experiment is expanded the costs of uranium extraction from seawater using this technology will be decreased which is ascribed to the increasing process capacity that results in the reduction of energy and investment costs and more stable operation fu et al 2023 thus it can be seen that with rational utilization of the cascade electro dehydration effect the process has excellent economic feasibility in addition to technical novelty finally a fine yellow uranium precipitate was isolated from the three stage sed ced sed effluent by the alkaline leaching method when the ph was adjusted by naoh fine precipitates appeared in the solution and turned yellow after filtration as shown in fig 7 a this yellow precipitate was characterized by eds and xps in fig 7b and 7c the eds and xps spectra confirmed the presence of uranium it is highly speculated that the precipitate was na2u2o7 one of the ingredients in the yellow cake overall the multiprocess integration of the sed and ced was capable of achieving highly efficient uranium extraction from simulated seawater by taking advantage of the electro dehydration effect notably a high yield of uranium over 80 was obtained with approximately 7 5 times the enrichment times with only three stages of operation the enrichment time might be further enhanced if the stage number is further increased 4 conclusions in this study the electro dehydration effect was proposed for uranium extraction and enrichment from simulated seawater the operating parameters were optimized to enhance the electro dehydration effect which was beneficial to increasing the uranium concentration the loose structure of cjmc 5 and applied current density of 4 ma cm2 enabled 1 8 fold uranium enrichment furthermore a cascade electro dehydration effect was developed by combining sed with ced to enhance the separation and enrichment of uranium simultaneously where the enrichment times reached approximately 7 5 times with a uranium yield rate higher than 80 in summary a cascade electro dehydration effect by integrating multistage sed and ced was capable of achieving uranium extraction and enrichment and simultaneously desalting the majority of salts the electro dehydration technique is a promising route for uranium extraction from seawater creating the possibility to replace the traditional physical adsorption method relying on the strengths of high enrichment low salinity and high yield performances however more comprehensive studies of scale up stacks with more integration stages are needed to evaluate the techno economic feasibility of the electro dehydration process for uranium extraction from real seawater in addition the membrane stack configuration should be modified in accordance with practical requirements and advanced membranes with high uranium permselectivity and long term stability should be fabricated to tackle actual and complex sea trials declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

unavoidable drawbacks from the inferior adsorption efficiency and adsorption capacity the large excess of competing ions and poor permselectivity of sorbents significantly decrease the adsorbent ability of uranium chi et al 2018 in addition some uranium uptake needs reduction by related processes li et al 2019 song et al 2022 zhang et al 2019 the physical adsorption method also suffers from adverse regeneration performance and high operating costs which limit its large scale application in actual sea trials tang et al 2020 selective electrodialysis sed is an electro driven membrane separation technology that is developed on the basis of conventional electrodialysis ced the specific characteristic of sed is that monovalent ion permselective membranes are assembled in the membrane stack which can fractionate and enrich monovalent ions against di or multivalent ions rehman et al 2021 yan et al 2022 in 2012 sed was initially proposed for the separation of nacl and na2so4 and the recovery disposal of phosphorus resources zhang et al 2012 henceforth numerous studies have focused on the development of this superior separation and enrichment technique for precise ion fractionation such as lithium extraction from salt lakes qiu et al 2019 wu et al 2022 recycling salt resources waste acid valorization and others chen et al 2021b wei et al 2022 ye et al 2019 zhang et al 2013 compared with other membrane technologies such as ced and nanofiltration sed can not only achieve the fractionation of monovalent ions from the mixed solution but also the enrichment of monovalent ions in addition the low operating pressure and high hydrophilic properties of ion exchange membranes facilitate the tolerance of sed technology to membrane fouling rendering this technology easily compatible and integrated with other separation units rehman et al 2021 overall sed provides the possibility for uranium extraction from seawater due to its functions of selective separation and enrichment however few studies have investigated uranium extraction from seawater via this promising method in fact the species of uranium in seawater are extremely complex that are correlated to the ionic strength concentration and ph endrizzi et al 2016 favre réguillon et al 2008 notably the main species of uranium in real seawater exists as anionic triscarbonato uranate namely uo2 co3 3 4 vi as a consequence it is possible to utilize sed for uranium extraction considering the large sized and multivalent nature of the uranate ion endrizzi and rao 2014 xie et al 2023 fig 2 demonstrates the schematic principle of the sed for uranium extraction from simulated seawater specifically under the influence of the current field monovalent ions predominantly cl will be isolated from seawater while multi valency uo2 co3 3 4 anions will be retarded by monovalent perm selective anion exchange membranes meanwhile na will be transported toward the cathode migrate across the cation exchange membranes and finally combine with cl to maintain charge neutrality as a result it is possible to extract uranium from seawater using the sed approach notably ion transport across the ion exchange membrane is usually accomplished in a hydrated state aliaskari and schäfer 2021 the transport of water molecules along with salts through an ion exchange membrane is a common phenomenon for typical electro membrane processes such as ced and sed van linden et al 2019 in most cases water transport is an undesirable phenomenon because it will decrease the concentration performance of monovalent ions notably in this study the transport phenomenon of water molecules from the dilute chamber to the concentrate chamber clarified as the electro dehydration effect is utilized for the simultaneous extraction and enrichment of the uranate ions in this article we proposed a novel electro dehydration process for the simultaneous extraction and enrichment of uranium from simulated seawater by taking advantage of water transport through ion exchange membranes and the high permselectivity of membranes for monovalent ions against uranate ions the membrane type and operating current density were systematically investigated to enlarge the electro dehydration effect thereafter sed was integrated with the traditional physical adsorption method illustrating the benefits of desalination of the majority of salts in the electro dehydration effect furthermore a cascade electro dehydration process was developed by combining sed with ced the effluent from sed containing uranate ions was further concentrated with ced and then subjected to the next batch of sed creating the possibility for cascade extraction and concentration the cascade electro dehydration process in the sed ced integration operation realized concurrent uranium extraction and enrichment the high enrichment times 7 5 times and satisfactorily selective desalting performance prove the high viability of the electro dehydration effect for highly effective uranium extraction from seawater 2 experimental 2 1 materials the cation exchange membranes used for the experiments were cjmc 5 heifei chemjoy polymer materials co ltd china twedc shandong tianwei membrane technology co ltd china and cm 2 astom co ltd japan the monovalent perm selective anion exchange membranes used for the experiment were asa astom co ltd japan the main properties of all the membranes are listed in table 1 nacl 25 6 g l nahco3 193 mg l and a uranium standard solution 3 mg l were prepared for the experiments to obtain simulated seawater containing uranium additionally naoh was used to regulate the ph of the solution at approximately 8 which is consistent with the ph of real seawater all chemicals used were analytical grade and purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china deionized water was used throughout the experiments 2 2 experimental procedures a self assembled setup for the sed experiments provided by hefei chemjoy polymer materials co ltd china was used for the experiments a direct current power supply hspy 60 10 beijing hanshengpuyuan science and technology co ltd china provided a driving force for uranium extraction connected to two electrodes on both sides of the sed stack the asa and cation exchange membranes each membrane size of 110 mm 270 mm with an effective area of 189 cm2 were alternately arranged between the anode and cathode to form three chambers namely the dilute chamber the concentrate chamber and the electrode chamber the solution corresponding to each chamber was simulated seawater containing uranium 1000 ml the same concentration as 25 6 g l nacl 200 ml and 0 3 mol l na2so4 500 ml respectively the silicone partition net thickness 0 8 mm was installed between two neighboring membranes to separate two neighboring chambers with the flow channels each chamber circulated the streams to form circulating loops and prevent the occurrence of concentration polarization by a peristaltic pump bt600 l baoding lead fluid technology co ltd china at a linear velocity of 3 cm s initially the operation parameters of the sed that is membrane type and current density were optimized to enhance the effects of uranium extraction from simulated seawater specifically three kinds of typical and commonly used cation exchange membranes that is cm 2 twedc and cjmc 5 were used to choose the most suitable membrane for high efficiency uranium extraction from seawater the current density was chosen in the range of 4 10 ma cm2 to evaluate the effect of the sed on the performance of uranium extraction from seawater in addition the volume ratio of initial concentrate to dilute was defined as 200 ml 1000 ml in each batch experiment the conductivity of the dilute and concentrate solutions was monitored using a conductivity meter dds 307 shanghai inesa scientific instrument co ltd china one batch sed experiment ended when the conductivity decreased to 5 ms cm with the dilute stream furthermore based on the optimization of sed operating parameters the feasibility and potential of integrating the sed with others were illustrated via the traditional physical adsorption method which also proved the benefits of desalination of the majority of salts in the electro dehydration effect then a cascade electro dehydration process was investigated by combining sed with ced simulated seawater containing uranium was consecutively treated via sed and ced to selectively extract and concentrate uranate ions significantly to be specific the effluent stream containing uranium after treatment by sed was subjected to ced and the resultant concentrate stream in ced was further introduced to sed 2 3 analysis and data calculation in each batch of experiments the conductivity and the voltage drop changes during the experiment were recorded the samples were taken at certain intervals of time for concentration analysis the concentration of uranium was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp oes optima 7300dv perkin elmer corporation the concentration of chloride ions was determined using an automatic potentiometric titrator zdj 4b shanghai oushtuer industrial co ltd china which was used to titrate through a standard silver nitrate solution the uranium enrichment times c e were calculated as li et al 2022 1 c e c u n d t c u n d 0 100 where c u n d 0 ppm and c u n d t ppm are the concentrations of uranium in the dilute chamber at times 0 and t respectively the water transport ω was calculated using eq 2 yan et al 2019 2 w v d 0 v d t v d 0 100 where v d 0 l and v d t l are the volumes of the dilute solution at times 0 and t respectively the leakage rate of uranium l was calculated using the following equation nie et al 2017 3 l c u n c t v c t c u n d 0 v d 0 100 where v c t l is the volume of the concentrate solution at time t and c u n c t ppm is the concentration of uranium in the concentrate chamber at time t the membrane permselectivity p between the monovalent and multivalent ions was used to evaluate the performance of the sed process which was calculated as eq 4 chen et al

al 2020 8 y c u n d t v d t c u n d 0 v d 0 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 selection of membranes to enlarge the electro dehydration effect the performance of the sed is directly determined by the properties of ion exchange membranes various ion exchange membranes are fabricated by different polymer skeletons and functional group structures which results in different electro dehydration performances of the sed xu 2005 in this study a dense anion exchange membrane with high permselectivity for monovalent anions that is asa was used for the selective separation of uranium and univalent anions additionally three types of commercial cation exchange membranes cm 2 twedc and cjmc 5 were used to evaluate the uranium enrichment performance in the sed process moreover all sed processes were implemented in a constant current mode and the current density was identified as 10 ma cm2 the initial volume ratio between concentrate and dilute was defined as 200 ml 1000 ml fig 3 shows the effect of three kinds of cation exchange membranes on uranium enrichment in the sed as shown in fig 3a the voltage drops always maintained an upward trend with the operating time specifically there was a slow increase followed by a rapid rise in the later stage which was closely related to the membrane stack resistance consisting of solution resistance and membrane resistance yan et al 2022 in general membrane resistance is almost a steady trend in the sed process however the solution resistance gradually increased with time under a constant current mode this was mainly attributed to the decrease in the concentration of nacl caused by the migration of salt from the dilute chamber to the concentrate chamber as shown in fig 3b galama et al 2014 simultaneously there was a significant gap in the values of the voltage drops which was mainly ascribed to the membrane resistances themselves furthermore the voltage drops of the three kinds of membranes presented a trend of twedc cjmc 5 cm 2 as shown in table 1 this trend was consistent with the resistances of the chosen membranes that is the higher the membrane resistance the higher the corresponding voltage value due to ohm s law especially in the later stage as the salt content decreased to the same level at an identical current density suggesting the same solution resistance wang et al 2020 moreover compared with cm 2 and twedc cjmc 5 took more time to reach the endpoint of the sed experiment resulting in a lower desalination efficiency as shown in fig 3b and table 2 this could be ascribed to the inherent characteristics of membranes with different thicknesses transport numbers area resistances ion exchange capacities etc ran et al 2017 water transport is a common phenomenon for a typical electro membrane process such as sed which is primarily attributed to concentration gradient osmosis and electro osmosis the former is caused by the concentration gradient difference between the dilute and concentrate chambers zhou et al 2018 in our case there was no significant discrepancy in the concentration gradient difference for the three investigated cation exchange membranes therefore the water transport caused by the concentration gradient was not pronounced the difference in water transport for the three kinds of membranes was mainly attributed to the electro osmosis effect zhou et al 2018 the hydrated na and cl ions migrated from the dilute to the concentrate chamber driven by an electric field force causing a substantial decrease in the volume in the dilute chamber notably the electro osmosis of water molecules through an ion exchange membrane depends on the nature of the membrane a membrane with a dense structure and small free volume size allows the transport of a few water molecules during the migration of hydrated ions across the membrane lu et al 2011 rottiers et al 2014 as shown in fig 3d the cm 2 and twedc membranes obtained almost the same water transport the water transport of cjmc 5 reached 19 3 which was higher than that of the two membranes meanwhile fig 3c indicated that the uranium enrichment times of cjmc 5 could be up to 1 3 times which was superior to the other two kinds of membranes this phenomenon was attributed to the fact that cjmc 5 had loose polymer skeleton structure and longer running time to facilitate the electro dehydration effect as a consequence the cjmc 5 membrane exhibited the best uranium enrichment performance by desalting the majority of salts traditionally electrodialysis with ion exchange membranes has been extensively applied for desalination and concentration while a loose structure ion exchange membrane is usually considered an undesired membrane structure interestingly in this study the electro dehydration effect was enhanced with a loose structure cjmc 5 membrane the high hydration ability of a loose structure membrane caused the osmosis of water molecules migrating from the dilute into the concentrate chamber during the desalination process leading to the concentration of uranate ions it is also noted that the cost of a loose structure membrane is relatively low because of the uncomplicated preparation routes with little use of crosslinking agents wang et al 2022a hence the usage of the cjmc 5 cation exchange membrane could turn weakness into strength leading to the separation and enrichment of uranium preferably with low operating cost unfortunately it can be seen from fig 3d and table 2 that the membrane of cjmc 5 also witnessed a higher uranium leakage rate and a lower permselectivity due to its looser membrane structure and longer running time compared with the dense membranes of cm 2 and twedc in summary from the viewpoint of uranium separation and enrichment the cjmc 5 membrane achieved 1 3 times enrichment performance with 19 3 water transport by taking advantage of the electro dehydration effect in the sed process this cation exchange membrane was also chosen for further experiments 3 2 effect of the current density during the sed process the current density is a crucial factor for the separation performance which directly affects desalination efficiency and water transport chen et al 2018 therefore it is necessary for an appropriate current density to enlarge the electro dehydration effect for uranium extraction and enrichment in this study current densities ranging from 4 ma cm2 to 10 ma cm2 were investigated based on the above experiments the cation exchange membrane of cjmc 5 and the anion exchange membrane of asa were applied with an initial volume ratio between the concentrate and dilute chamber of 200 ml 1000 ml the voltage drops as a function of time is indicated in fig 4 a the voltage drops increased with an increase in current density which was consistent with ohm s law as mentioned above it was undoubtedly logical that the higher the current density the higher the values of voltage with a relatively constant stack resistance when the sed stack was in a steady state wang et al 2020 additionally as the sed experiment progressed the voltage drops demonstrated an increasing trend with the elapse of time as mentioned earlier meanwhile the concentration of nacl decreased steadily with the operating time until the conductivity of the dilute solution decreased to 5 ms cm as shown in fig 4b which also revealed that the sed experiments acquired a satisfactory desalination performance furthermore as the current density increased the running time of the sed was shortened dramatically thus it was inevitable that a high current density allowed for higher desalination efficiency as shown in table 3 fig 4c illustrates the effect of the current density on uranium enrichment times it was obvious that the current density had a significant effect on uranium enrichment performance to be specific the concentrations of uranium for one batch sed experiment continued to increase with prolonged time which was caused by water transport of hydrated ions and water molecules from the dilute chamber to the concentrate chamber as shown in fig 4d as the current density increased from 4 to 10 ma cm2 the water transport was 43 6 32 0 25 9 and 19 3 respectively additionally the corresponding uranium enrichment times reached maxima of 1 8 1 6 1 4 and 1 3 respectively therefore it was found that a lower current density was more conducive to a further increase in uranium concentration in the dilute stream this might be attributed to the fact that a lower current density prolonged the running time of the sed experiment which accelerated water transport observably the effect of electro osmosis on water transport was almost identical for all current densities because of the similar desalination rate in each experiment therefore the water transport rate increased with decreasing current density primarily because more water molecules migrated from the dilute chamber to the concentrate chamber over a longer period of time zhou et al 2018 meanwhile it was also further confirmed that the splendid electro dehydration effect caused by low current density enabled uranium extraction nevertheless although low current density played an essential role in improving the uranium enrichment effect there were still negative impacts except for low desalination efficiency it was also accompanied by a relatively high leakage rate which was ascribed to the low current density having a weak electric field driving force this resulted in hydrated ions taking more time to achieve ion migration from the dilute chamber to the concentrate chamber compared to the high current density moreover the monovalent perm selective anion exchange membranes have relatively superior interception performances of high valence anions while it is not 100 interception completely so that the uranium would leak into the concentrate chamber thus with prolonged running time in the sed process the uranium leakage rate also increased due to the accumulation of slightly migrated uranium quantities furthermore in regard to the permselectivity exhibited in fig 4d it could be found that a high current density obtained admirable results on account of the uranium leakage rate it was logical that there was a trade off effect between enrichment times and the permselectivity of uranium which should be systematically considered and negotiated in practical applications based on lab level basic research we may pursue higher uranium enrichment times which urges choosing a low current density however extraction efficiency and uranium quality are considered in actual sea trials obviously a higher current density would be applicable with a shorter time and higher permselectivity furthermore the appropriate voltage and plenty of repeat units may be more favorable to industrial and large scale uranium extraction from seawater for convenience and economy in addition more excellent monovalent perm selective anion exchange membranes have been utilized with the deepening of scientific research which also ameliorates the trade off effect in summary even though a low current density had shortcomings in the uranium leakage rate it facilitated satisfactorily efficient uranium extraction performances by simultaneously ensuring a high desalination effect via the electro dehydration effect to enlarge a high electro dehydration effect in the sed process the current density was optimized as 4 ma cm2 where the enrichment times could maximally reach 1 8 times with a water transport rate of 43 6 3 3 a cascade electro dehydration with the integration of sed according to the experimental results previously described it is acknowledged that the electro dehydration effect in sed allowed one step separation and enrichment of uranium from simulated seawater however the electro osmosis of hydrated ions played a major role in water transport which was unable to be changed by tuning the parameters of membrane type and current density yan et al 2019 as a consequence the optimization of operating parameters in one batch sed experiment had limitations for uranium extraction to further increase the uranium extraction performance a cascade electro dehydration process was developed by combining sed with ced specifically the effluent from sed containing uranate ions was further concentrated with ced and then subjected to the next batch of sed the feasibility and potential of a cascade electro dehydration process will be evaluated 3 3 1 potential benefits of electro dehydration for uranium adsorption the electro dehydration effect achieved uranium enrichment and simultaneously desalted the majority of salts it is necessary to explore the impact of desalination on uranium extraction performance the physical adsorption method is the predominant method used for uranium extraction from seawater the uranium adsorption performances from simulated seawater between treatment with sed by introducing the electro dehydration effect and without any treatment were compared the physical adsorption experiment was conducted with 717 anion exchange resin of the chlorine type and three aqueous solutions i e simulated seawater containing uranium initial feed treated effluent at 4 ma cm2 treated 1 and treated effluent at 10 ma cm2 treated 2 were compared and tested specifically the volume of feed solution for the physical adsorption experiment was 40 ml the anion exchange resin weight was 2 g and static adsorption was carried out for approximately 48 hours the adsorption capacity and adsorption efficiency were calculated to evaluate the uranium adsorption performances which also enabled us to further confirm the functions of the sed fig 5 demonstrates that the adsorption efficiency and adsorption capacity of the three kinds of feed solutions changed over time the values of q and e for the three solutions increased with the progress of static adsorption while the effluents treated with sed obtained higher values compared with the initial simulated seawater containing uranium specifically the values of q increased by approximately 4 times for the adsorption capacity the value of e with the initial feed reached approximately 30 as the adsorption time was prolonged in contrast the value of e reached nearly 100 after the sed treatment which increased by approximately 3 times in addition the simulated seawater containing uranium treated by sed required a shorter time to the adsorption endpoint that had the maximum adsorption capacity and the highest adsorption efficiency in conclusion the desalination of the majority salts by introducing the electro dehydration effect could enhance the uranium adsorption capacity and adsorption efficiency which provides the possibility of the practical application of the sed technique for uranium extraction from real seawater 3 3 2 a cascade electro dehydration by combining sed and ced ultimately a cascade electro dehydration by combining sed and ced was developed to further enhance the uranium extraction performance a schematic diagram of the multiprocess integration of sed with ced is shown in fig 2b specifically seawater containing uranium was applied to the sed stack by taking advantage of the electro dehydration effect allowing uranium extraction in the dilute stream then the dilute effluent was divided into two streams and further fed into the ced stack for concentration according to a certain volume ratio finally the concentrate effluent of the ced was further subjected to the next sed as a consequence cascade isolation and concentration of uranium could be obtained by a combination of sed and ced integration experiments for industrial uranium extraction from seawater the uranium enrichment rate and handling capacity can be reasonably expanded by increasing the coupling number however due to the limited treating capacity in the first sed stack only a three stage sed ced sed experiment was carried out to evaluate the feasibility of the cascade electro dehydration effect fig 6 indicates the uranium extraction and concentration performance in a cascade electro dehydration process by a three stage sed ced sed coupling experiment as shown in fig 6a the voltage drops including sed and ced presented an increasing trend with time the decrease in conductivity resulted in an increase in the resistance of the solution in the dilute chamber this phenomenon was consistent with the results presented above galama et al 2014 in addition compared with the sed the voltage drops in the ced increased more sharply this is attributed to the fact that the solution resistance increased sharply in the dilute stream in the later stage of the ced experiment in regard to the nacl concentration as shown in fig 6b the salt contents substantially decreased at the end of the 1st sed and 3rd sed operation while the nacl concentration during the 2nd ced exhibited the opposite phenomenon in that the concentration of nacl increased with time thus it was obvious that the sed was more appropriate to be operated at the end of the cascade electro dehydration process to obtain a low salinity effluent containing uranium from the aspect of uranium enrichment as shown in fig 6c the uranium enrichment times increased steadily with time elapsed this phenomenon was also confirmed by the water transport data in fig 6d specifically a superior electro dehydration effect indicated by high water transport occurred in the 1st sed and the 3rd sed which was favorable for uranium enrichment as mentioned above low water transport contributed to the concentration of uranium in the ced process which was beneficial to the migration of uranium into the concentrate chamber in the 2nd ced experiment the appropriate water transport rate was only 4 1 which was much worse than that of the sed due to utilizing dense ion exchange membranes to carry out the ced experiment nevertheless the implementation of 2nd ced allowed a substantial increase in uranium enrichment times higher than 6 however there was still a drawback that the ced concentrated both uranium and other salts therefore the sed played a dual role in uranium separation and enrichment while the ced only played a role in uranium enrichment in this study the uranium was concentrated to approximately 22 ppm the enrichment times reached approximately 7 5 times and the yield of uranium enabled over 80 after a three stage sed ced sed coupling operation considering all the operations of uranium extraction a techno economic analysis of the cascade electro dehydration by combining sed and ced was performed for the uranium extraction process to demonstrate its economic feasibility it should be noted that the techno economic analysis is based on the actual performance data of the laboratory unit under experimental conditions because the operating conditions and process capacity will affect the techno economic evaluation according to the calculation results in table 4 the total techno economic cost was 101 78 m3 which mainly consisted of the total energy cost and investment cost according to the calculation results it was obvious that the most expensive part of this process was the investment cost among which the peripheral equipment cost was the most expensive of course as the scale of the experiment is expanded the costs of uranium extraction from seawater using this technology will be decreased which is ascribed to the increasing process capacity that results in the reduction of energy and investment costs and more stable operation fu et al 2023 thus it can be seen that with rational utilization of the cascade electro dehydration effect the process has excellent economic feasibility in addition to technical novelty finally a fine yellow uranium precipitate was isolated from the three stage sed ced sed effluent by the alkaline leaching method when the ph was adjusted by naoh fine precipitates appeared in the solution and turned yellow after filtration as shown in fig 7 a this yellow precipitate was characterized by eds and xps in fig 7b and 7c the eds and xps spectra confirmed the presence of uranium it is highly speculated that the precipitate was na2u2o7 one of the ingredients in the yellow cake overall the multiprocess integration of the sed and ced was capable of achieving highly efficient uranium extraction from simulated seawater by taking advantage of the electro dehydration effect notably a high yield of uranium over 80 was obtained with approximately 7 5 times the enrichment times with only three stages of operation the enrichment time might be further enhanced if the stage number is further increased 4 conclusions in this study the electro dehydration effect was proposed for uranium extraction and enrichment from simulated seawater the operating parameters were optimized to enhance the electro dehydration effect which was beneficial to increasing the uranium concentration the loose structure of cjmc 5 and applied current density of 4 ma cm2 enabled 1 8 fold uranium enrichment furthermore a cascade electro dehydration effect was developed by combining sed with ced to enhance the separation and enrichment of uranium simultaneously where the enrichment times reached approximately 7 5 times with a uranium yield rate higher than 80 in summary a cascade electro dehydration effect by integrating multistage sed and ced was capable of achieving uranium extraction and enrichment and simultaneously desalting the majority of salts the electro dehydration technique is a promising route for uranium extraction from seawater creating the possibility to replace the traditional physical adsorption method relying on the strengths of high enrichment low salinity and high yield performances however more comprehensive studies of scale up stacks with more integration stages are needed to evaluate the techno economic feasibility of the electro dehydration process for uranium extraction from real seawater in addition the membrane stack configuration should be modified in accordance with practical requirements and advanced membranes with high uranium permselectivity and long term stability should be fabricated to tackle actual and complex sea trials declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

suppressing it when dissolved in a similar manner to the arg gly asp rgd peptide in mammalian cell cultures bacteria adhere to iglsslpr and poly l lysine coated membranes with similar energies and exhibit water fluxes that decline similarly which is ascribable to interaction as strong as electrostatic interactions in the peptide coated membranes we conclude that iglsslpr is the key domain

microorganism attachment in water leads to biofouling which positively impacts bioremediation by decomposing waste in the environment but negatively impacts marine membrane based water treatment and medical implant materials by reducing their performance flemming 2020 seo et al 2018 among them biofouling is closely related to the security of safe and abundant water resources which is of utmost importance owing to increasing global water scarcity associated with population growth water pollution and climate change elimelech and phillip 2011 greenlee et al 2009 and membrane based wastewater reclamation offers a way of maintaining secure water resources under these circumstances methods based on membrane bioreactors reverse osmosis ro and forward osmosis fo are increasingly used due to their superior efficiencies for treating organics and ions de vries et al 2020 despite these advances membrane biofouling remains a very elusive problem such fouling can increase operational expenses by 10 24 due reductions in membrane efficiency in addition secondary pollution is produced because cleaning chemicals are required jafari et al 2021 various methods have been developed to resolve membrane biofouling issues including the identification of foulants the addition of antibacterial agents the use of antifouling surface coatings chemical cleaning and operating condition optimization farhat et al 2016 khan et al 2015 liu et al 2022 sweity et al 2013 however despite the development of numerous strategies for controlling membrane biofouling regulating microorganism based fouling is currently impossible due to a lack of in depth understanding reversible fouling which involves the loose attachment of foulants on the membrane surface is removable by chemical reagents that interfere with bacterial biofilm formation wang et al 2014 yamamura et al 2007 on the other hand irreversible fouling remains on the surface even after physical and chemical cleaning due to the strong attachment of the fouling layer formed during long term use therefore irreversible membrane fouling during wastewater treatment remains a technically difficult issue because such fouling is strongly resistant to a variety of chemical and physical cleaning methods consequently the irreversible fouling mechanism needs to be better understood to mitigate membrane fouling numerous microorganisms are involved in the irreversible fouling process in wastewater reclamation plants meng et al 2017 zhan et al 2020 microbial flocs in biofilms secrete extracellular polymeric substances epss that are mainly responsible for irreversible fouling wang et al 2009 weinrich et al 2016 the epss produced by cells are macromolecular mixtures that are mainly composed of polysaccharides proteins humic substances and lipids among other as extracellular matrices they contribute to microbial adhesion and cell proliferation salama et al 2016 seviour et al 2019 therefore understanding the biological properties of the eps is a prerequisite for developing cleaning strategies and mitigating membrane fouling de vries et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 both genetic control at the cellular level and environmental factors highly regulate the formation of the eps matrix flemming et al 2023 however signaling between microbes at the cellular level in wastewater and the fouling inducing molecules are insufficiently understood as multiple and species specific systems are involved for example quorum sensing is the well known intercellular signal mechanism that is universally involved in microbial communication galloway et al 2011 shrout and nerenberg 2012 and n acylhomoserine lactone is a key molecule that regulates biofouling gene expression in a microbial network dong et al 2001 wang et al 2021 in the signal transduction pathway of other species intracellular secondary messengers like cyclic di guanosine 5 monophosphate c di gmp and small rnas are considered the main bacterial regulators wolska et al 2016 among eps matrix produced by the signaling between microbes at the cellular level extracellular proteins are more abundant than other fouling components and enhance microbial aggregation by acting as enzymes ligands agonists or structural proteins zhang et al 2019 eps proteins can be determined by proteomic analysis that usually involves gel based methods and lc

electrophoresis 2d page and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry maldi tof ms however 2d page based analyzes are unable to detect unstained proteins or types of protein that are not mobile in the 2d gel and the use of maldi tof ms to detect small peptides is somewhat limited due to strong background signals from abundant matrix molecules used in the ionization process rabilloud et al 2009 therefore the fouling inducing proteins in the eps need to be identified at the proteomic level using gel free electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry esi ms ms to better understand the mechanism responsible for irreversible membrane fouling in addition the identified peptides involved in microbial attachment and biofilm formation on the membrane

identified peptide peptide synthesis with 95 purity was performed by cosmogenetech seoul korea there were two different biofilm formation assays biofilms on a peptide coated membrane and biofilms with soluble peptide an iglsslpr peptide coated membrane was used to examine the biofilm formed on its surface a reverse osmosis ro membrane was coated with the peptide using the edc nhs method huang et al 2017 the membrane was washed with ethanol and di water and activated in 2 n morpholino ethanesulfonic acid mes buffer containing 0 1 mol l edc and 0 5 w v nhs the membrane was stored at 37 c for 1 h and washed with di water a 1 mg ml solution of peptide in pbs was added to the membrane and allowed to stand at room temperature for 2 h the coated membrane was then washed with di water the biofilm was formed on punch cut sections with 5 mm diameter of the coated membrane using p alcaligenes which was grown in lb broth at 37 c for 24 h after which the cell suspension was diluted to an od600 of 0 02 in m9 broth containing 20 glucose 1 m cacl2 1 m mgso4 and 1 mg ml thiamin hcl the cell suspension and coated membrane sections were added to the wells of a 96 well plate and incubated at 37 c for 24 h the cell suspensions were then removed and the membranes pieces were washed with di water to remove planktonic cells the biofilms formed on each membrane section were stained with 0 1 w v crystal violet 200 µl for 15 min the membrane pieces were then rinsed with di water and dried ethanol 200 µl was then added and stored for 15 min at room temperature after which absorbance was measured at 595 nm biofilms formed in the plate wells when the peptide was dissolved in suspension were analyzed by adding diluted cells and the peptide solution to the wells of a 96 well plate to a final concentration of 1 mg ml the plate was then incubated at 37 c for 24 h and then washed with deionized di water and dried the biofilm in each well was stained with 0 1 w v crystal violet for 15 min and washed with di water ethanol 200 µl 95 was added to the dyed plate and incubated at room temperature for 15 min after which absorbance was measured at 595 nm 2 10 fouling characteristics an xle 2540 thin film composite dow midland mi usa was used as the model ro membrane a membrane coated with iglsslpr peptide and poly l lysine pll mw 5000 sk bioland s korea using the edc nhs method described above was used to examine fouling characteristics fouling experiments were performed using a laboratory scale cross flow test unit as previously described choi et al 2022 briefly the ro membrane was cut and placed in a 7 7 2 6 0 3 cm stainless steel frame permeate flux was continuously measured using a digital scale connected to a computer and then recirculated back to the feed using a siphon while the retentate was directly recirculated back to the feed tank the cross flow velocity and operating pressure were adjusted to 10 cm s and 7 bar respectively the fouling procedure involved a feed water volume of 2 l and the initial flux was measured using a bacterium free synthetic wastewater effluent solution under the abovementioned operating conditions kwan et al 2015 fouling was initiated by adding 106 cells ml of pseudomonas alcaligenes and carried out to a recovery ratio of 10 equivalent to 200 ml of permeate a 1 cm2 area of each membrane was subsequently examined using a confocal laser scanning microscope clsm lsm 880 with airyscan carl zeiss germany the biofilm on the membrane was stained with 3 34 mm syto9 and 20 mm pi according to the manufacturer s instructions stained samples were kept at room temperature for 15 min and washed three times with 0 9 nacl before mounting five areas were observed by clsm and cell biovolumes were determined using biofilmq software 2 11 adhesion characteristics an atomic force microscope afm bruker santa barbara ca usa was used to analyze the adhesion characteristics of peptide coated membranes briefly a commercial sin probe with a 2 μm borosilicate glass particle attached to the tip of a cantilever with a spring constant of 0 06 n m novascan ia usa was used afm adhesion forces between the glass particle and the bare pll coated and iglsslpr coated membranes were determined using the liquid drop merge method in a fluid cell by merging electrolyte solutions containing 8 5 mm nacl and 0 5 mm cacl2 as previously described park et al 2023 forces were measured following 30 min of equilibration in each case the afm instrument was operated in force mode with a piezo movement approach retraction speed of 0 5 μm s and 0 5 μm of piezo movement forces were measured at five locations with at least 12 values acquired at each location 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term operation of a pilot scale fo system fig s1 shows a pilot scale fo system for wastewater reclamation that contains two fo membrane modules one is operated with a wastewater effluent containing 10 mg l of monochloramine mca a disinfectant used to control biofilm development on the fo membrane and the other with a disinfectant free feed solution the change in water flux during the long term operation of fo process in both conditions are depicted in the fig 1 a each membrane was chemically cleaned using commercial acidic and alkaline chemical cleaning agents when the water flux had declined by 30 compared to its initial value in case of the control experiment w o mca the water flux was not completely restored even after multiple chemical cleaning procedures during the fo operation as shown in fig 1a specifically the water flux levels only reached 70 0 of the initial water flux after the first cleaning procedure and subsequent cleaning procedures did not demonstrate any improvement in cleaning effectiveness fouling during forward osmosis is a well established reversible process compared to that of a pressurized system however irreversible fouling is inevitable when feed water with an extremely high potential of fouling by inorganic and organic materials and bacteria is treated xie et al 2015 on the other hand the reduction in water flux during the fo process was considerably postponed and the recovery of flux was greatly enhanced up to 92 3 of the initial water flux level by introducing mca as a biocide as compared to the control experiment this delay is ascribable to the oxidation of organic foulants as well as the disinfecting ability of mca xue et al 2014 previous studies have also reported that mca is relatively stable and inhibits biofouling without degrading the polyamide structure do et al 2012 park et al 2020 even though better flux recovery was observed when mca was used compared to that observed for the mca free scenario the initial water flux was not recovered which indicates that irreversible fouling occurs even in the presence of mca a schematic depiction of the long term operation of the pilot scale fo process in the presence and absence of mca as well as the occurrence of irreversible fouling under both conditions irrespective of chemical cleaning is presented in fig 1b 3 2 composition of microbial community the operational taxonomic units otus at the phylum and genus levels of the two eps samples reveal that mca based disinfection affects the bacterial communities present as shown in fig 2 bacteroidetes 22 8 acidobacteria 20 0 proteobacteria 17 7 and nitrospirae 16 6 are the abundant phyla in the mca untreated system while proteobacteria 62 7 actinobacteria 5 8 and bacteroidetes 3 1 are the major phyla when treated with mca fig 2a clearly proteobacteria are predominant in each sample these bacteria have been reported to constitute the main populations on fouled membranes nagaraj et al 2017 rehman et al 2019 hence the proteobacteria phylum is expected to enhance biofilm communities and survive in membrane based wastewater plants during irreversible fouling disinfection was observed to simplify the overall dominant bacterial phyla compared to the mca free case bacteroidetes were largely absent and a larger quantity of actinobacteria were observed after mca treatment unlike proteobacteria and bacteroidetes actinobacteria are gram positive bacteria that are more resistant to external chemical stresses than gram negative bacteria because they have thicker peptidoglycan layers mai prochnow et al 2016 song et al 2018 hence actinobacteria may form a protective extracellular matrix within the biofilm community the otu results reveal that the proteobacteria and actinobacteria in the eps are likely to be more resistive to various stresses such as disinfection thereby inducing irreversible fouling on the membrane by attaching to microbes and surviving in the bacterial community at the genus level stenotrophobacter 18 79 ohtaekwangia 17 54 nitrospira 16 59 were abundant in the mca untreated system while pseudomonas 18 84 acidovorax 10 17 were detected in the mca treated system fig 2b these abundant genera and species were used to create the customized database and single strain system 3 3 quantitative eps comparisons to understand how disinfection affects proteins and to characterize the fouling inducing proteins we analyzed the protein concentrations and amino acid compositions of the eps the eps formed in the presence of mca contained significantly less protein compared to that formed in the absence of mca 69 91 vs 152 43 µg ml fig 3 a however the proteins remaining in the eps formed in the presence of mca are expected to result in strong biofouling during disinfection fig 3b shows that alanine aspartic acid asparagine glycine and glutamic acid glutamine account for 17 26 11 9 10 19 and 10 12 of the untreated eps composition and 16 87 12 25 10 52 and 7 12 of the mca treated eps these levels were found to be much higher than those of other amino acids the total proportions of amino acids are consistent with the cellular amino acid abundances previously reported for microorganisms in various environments moura et al 2013 in addition similar overall amino acid compositions were observed irrespective of disinfection which indicates that the membrane disinfection process does not remove specific amino acids in the eps and that the unremoved proteins on the fouled membrane originate from microorganisms these remaining proteins are important components that induce irreversible biofouling during disinfection 3 4 identification of eps proteins by ms the eps proteomes were analyzed using lc ms ms and the gel free method to identify whole eps proteins metagenome sequencing bacterial proteins c di gmp associated pilz and pled and pilus fimh and papg proteins were used as a customized database table 1 a which lists proteins with p values greater than 20 reveals that the highest p values in the mca treated group correspond to the tonb dependent receptors of pararheinheimera mesophila tonb systems play roles in transporting nutrients siderophores saccharides and aromatic compounds across the outer membrane fujita et al 2019 this transport is regulated by quorum sensing in paracoccus denitrificans fujita et al 2019 moreover the atp binding cassette abc transporter substrate binding proteins of comamonas aquatica and pseudomonas alcaligenes were also identified these two species are included in proteobacteria which is the major phyla of the eps the polysaccharide structure is assembled in the cytoplasm and exported through the abc transporter dependent pathway willis and whitfield 2013 the abc transporter is an important factor for biofilm formation and irreversible attachment hinsa et al 2003 fimbrial proteins were found in the epss formed in the absence and presence of mca in the fimh and papg cases fimh is an adhesive bacterial pilus protein that controls adhesion by acting as a lectin that binds to mannose schembri et al 2001 tchesnokova et al 2011 the identified proteins which are located on the outer membrane and are exposed to the external environment are expected to increase tolerance to environmental chemicals table 1b lists peptides ordered by intensity 107 including peptide p values coverage intensity and protein description intensity can be interpreted as peptide concentration and can be used to highlight dominant proteins atpase and glycosyltransferases have been identified in the bacterial protein database glycosyltransferase is a polymerase that forms glycosidic linkages and transfers sugar moieties therefore it enhances the polysaccharide quantities in the eps and modulates interactions between biofilm matrix components katherine et al 2019 among abundant peptides with intensities greater than 107 the pilz domain containing proteins exhibited the largest values 1 79 108 and 7 90 107 in the mca untreated and treated systems respectively the pilz protein binds to c di gmp which is the second signal messenger that controls bacterial motility and sessility pilz domain containing proteins such as alg44 found in p aeruginosa are involved in c di gmp dependent extracellular polysaccharide production merighi et al 2007 3 5 analysis of abundant peptides fig 4 a and b display 3d rt m z intensity diagrams that express precursor peptides identified in the mca untreated and treated groups peak intensities are color coded and dominant peptides are confirmed based on their intensity values most peptides exhibited intensity values of less than 1 50 107 highlighted in black in both the mca untreated and treated groups the peaks marked with asterisks in fig 4a and b correspond to iglsslpr which was detected both w o mca and w mca the peptide had the highest intensity value as mentioned in table 1b the tandem mass spectra for this peptide are shown in fig 4c and d and the peptide sequence has an m z of 421 76 and is doubly charged z 2 iglsslpr is a peptide of the pilz domain containing protein in methylobacterium which is of the order rhizobiales that is the fourth most abundant in the epss formed in the absence 9 52 and presence 0 17 of mca in addition the peptide was identified to have the highest area value in both eps sets hence a large number of proteins remain following sterilization pilz domains bind to c di gmp and their levels controls bacterial behavior consequently these proteins exhibit important functions through protein protein interactions including alginate synthesis cellulose synthesis and flagellar activity hengge 2009 as these proteins are associated with the bacterial signaling system and because iglsslpr dominates both eps sets it is expected be a critical signaling factor for cell cell interactions or surface cell interactions during membrane fouling a microbial system study involving the identified peptides is required to understand bacterial behavior in the biofilm environment 3 6 relationship between the iglsslpr peptide and microbial biofilm the complexity of eps proteins in wastewater necessitated a single strain experiment to increase the reliability of peptide identification using a clear database we evaluated whether or not the pilz associated proteins and iglsslpr motif found in wastewater exist under conditions of microbial biofilm formation two types of microorganisms were used as model species p alcaligenes which was predominantly found in the microbial community of the w mca sample as shown in table s2 was used as the first model species m iners which contains the iglsnlpr motif of pilz domain containing proteins was used as the second fig s2 m iners was used to confirm the presence of the peptide under biofilm formation conditions biofilms were assayed under two environmental factors shaking and static conditions to evaluate whether the pilz protein and iglsslpr peptide were identified under conditions where biofilms formed well p alcaligenes and m iners biofilms are shown in fig 5 a and b respectively both model species formed less biofilm when shaken than under static conditions however the bacteria grew faster when shaken fig s3 fig 5c shows that while pilz associated proteins were identified for both p alcaligenes and m iners under shaking and static conditions in the presence of biofilms the iglsnlpr motif was found only in m iners grown under static conditions fig 5d which indicates that the peptide is found under conditions where more biofilm is formed in a manner that is independent of the presence of pilz proteins additional experiments that include both rnaseq and expressed gene difference techniques are needed to determine the effect of the motif on bacterial attachment and membrane fouling in addition the mechanism by which the identified iglsslpr peptide affects microbial biofilm formation was examined using a model species p alcaligenes a major bacterial species found in the fouling layer of the mca treated system table s2 was used to assay biofilm formation biofilms were examined on the peptide coated membrane and in the peptide cell suspension more biofilm was observed when iglsslpr was present on the peptide immobilized membrane surface while less biofilm formed when the peptide was present in the cell suspension fig 6 which suggests that the peptide coated membrane surface promotes bacterial attachment and this attachment is inhibited when the peptide is present in the cell suspension this is similar to the functioning of the arg gly asp rgd peptide that is well known in mammalian cell cultures the rgd peptide is found in extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin which induces mammalian cell adhesion and settlement has become a key peptide for tissue engineering nicol et al 1992 pierschbacher and ruoslahti 1984 similar to the rgd peptide found in fibronectin the iglsslpr peptide with cell attachment properties will have an impact on fouling 3 7 adhesion characteristics of the peptide we used afm to better understand the adhesion characteristics of the discovered peptide by determining the adhesion forces between the cantilever bearing a 2 μm borosilicate glass particle and the bare pll coated and iglsslpr coated membranes fig 7 b d positively charged pll was used as the positive control fragment because most bacterial membranes have net negative charges and therefore attract microbes through long range electrostatic interactions compared to iglsslpr pll is strongly hydrophilic owing to its positive charge as shown in fig 7a the pll and iglsslpr coated membranes exhibited significantly stronger adhesion forces to the glass particle 0 637 0 355 and 0 640 0 280 mn m respectively than the bare membrane 0 221 0 097 mn m the strong adhesion observed for the pll coated membrane is not surprising given that pll is widely used to attach bacterial cells to glass or polymeric surfaces through electrostatic interactions associated with its positively charged nature colville et al 2010 on the other hand the iglsslpr coated membrane adhered to the glass particle as strongly as the pll coated system therefore the discovered peptide using its strong adhesion characteristics can be utilized as a glue to form mechanically stable flocs or granules in such environmental engineering processes 3 8 fouling characteristics of the peptide to accurately determine the effect of the peptide identified based on its biofouling potential dynamic biofouling assays were conducted using a lab scale cross flow ro unit with bare pll coated and iglsslpr coated membranes synthetic wastewater effluent medium was used as the feed solution and p alcaligenes was added at an initial concentration of 106 cells ml water flux gradually declined over a permeate volume of 200 ml due to the attachment of bacteria to the membrane flux was observed to decline by 15 as 200 ml of permeate was passed through the bare membrane which is ascribable to bacterial attachment whereas the analogous fluxes of the pll coated and iglsslpr coated membranes declined by 18 and 20 respectively which suggests that iglsslpr induces bacterial attachment fig 8 a to better understand the role of the iglsslpr peptide in enhancing bacterial attachment the membrane was removed from the cell at a 10 recovery ratio and analyzed using confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm for detection of live and dead cells in the biofilm on the membrane syto9 and propidium iodide pi were used which stain live cells green and dead cells red respectively stiefel et al 2015 three dimensional 3 d views of the three biofilms reveal structural differences between those developed on the bare pll coated and iglsslpr coated membranes fig 8c the biofilm layer on the pll coated and iglsslpr coated membranes appear to cover the entire membrane area whereas bacteria are only partially attached to the bare membrane the total cell biovolume per area of each biofilm was determined from the clsm image the biofilm developed on the iglsslpr coated membrane after recovering 10 of the feed solution was observed to be dense and composed of more cells 0 554 0 019 μm3 μm 2 compared to that formed on the bare membrane 0 212 0 018 μm3 μm 2 fig 8b the bacterial attachment was only slightly lower for iglsslpr coated membranes compared to the pll coated membrane 0 603 0 045 μm3 μm 2 we conclude that bacterial attachment to the iglsslpr coated membrane surface is enhanced by the strong adhesion characteristics of iglsslpr among eps proteins the iglsslpr pilz domain containing peptide was found to be dominant and was subsequently shown to induce biofilm formation and enhance bacterial attachment to the membrane surface owing to its exceptional adhesion characteristics which are comparable to those of pll that operates through strong electrostatic interactions therefore the peptide discovered in this study can be used to understand microbial fouling phenomena and develop antifouling technology through the use of antagonists that counter the fouling mechanism 4 conclusion in this study we analyzed the microbiomes and proteomes of epss on fo membranes during long term operation in a pilot scale system under irreversible fouling conditions unknown peptides on the fo were identified and their functions were evaluated to better understand the irreversible fouling phenomenon the conclusions are as follows the application of mca reduced the quantity of eps proteins present in the system by inhibiting microbial activity rather than a specific amino acid residue nevertheless the remaining amino acid compositions were marginal to the mca free process which indicates that epss produced from microorganisms are strongly attached to the membrane even in the presence of a disinfectant which is the main cause of irreversible fouling eps proteins from wastewater were identified using lc ms ms and a customized database during proteomic analysis which led to the discovery of the iglsslpr peptide which is a part of the pilz domain containing protein in addition the iglsnlpr peptide was identified when a biofilm was developed using m iners as a model bacterium enhanced bacterial attachment was observed when the membrane surface was coated with iglsslpr whereas iglsslpr inhibited bacterial attachment when suspended in the medium the iglsslpr peptide is expected to be useful for the further development of antifouling technology the iglsslpr adheres to membrane surfaces as strongly as pll which adheres through electrostatic interactions therefore it promoted biofouling with the model microbes the discovered peptide induces microbial aggregation when co suspended with the model bacterium owing to its adhesion characteristics declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

14728,membrane based wastewater reclamation is used to mitigate water scarcity however irreversible biofouling is an elusive problem that hinders the efficiency of a forward osmosis fo membrane based process and the protein responsible for fouling is unknown herein we identified fouling proteins by analyzing the microbiome and proteome of wastewater extracellular polymeric substances responsible for strong irreversible fo membrane fouling the iglsslpr peptide of a pilz domain containing protein was found to recruit bacterial attachment when immobilized on the membrane surface while suppressing it when dissolved in a similar manner to the arg gly asp rgd peptide in mammalian cell cultures bacteria adhere to iglsslpr and poly l lysine coated membranes with similar energies and exhibit water fluxes that decline similarly which is ascribable to interaction as strong as electrostatic interactions in the peptide coated membranes we conclude that iglsslpr is the key domain responsible for membrane fouling and can be used to develop antifouling technology against bacteria which is similar to the current usage of rgd peptide in mammalian cell cultures graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords irreversible fouling lc ms ms pilz protein bacterial attachment atomic force microscopy data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction microorganism attachment in water leads to biofouling which positively impacts bioremediation by decomposing waste in the environment but negatively impacts marine membrane based water treatment and medical implant materials by reducing their performance flemming 2020 seo et al 2018 among them biofouling is closely related to the security of safe and abundant water resources which is of utmost importance owing to increasing global water scarcity associated with population growth water pollution and climate change elimelech and phillip 2011 greenlee et al 2009 and membrane based wastewater reclamation offers a way of maintaining secure water resources under these circumstances methods based on membrane bioreactors reverse osmosis ro and forward osmosis fo are increasingly used due to their superior efficiencies for treating organics and ions de vries et al 2020 despite these advances membrane biofouling remains a very elusive problem such fouling can increase operational expenses by 10 24 due reductions in membrane efficiency in addition secondary pollution is produced because cleaning chemicals are required jafari et al 2021 various methods have been developed to resolve membrane biofouling issues including the identification of foulants the addition of antibacterial agents the use of antifouling surface coatings chemical cleaning and operating condition optimization farhat et al 2016 khan et al 2015 liu et al 2022 sweity et al 2013 however despite the development of numerous strategies for controlling membrane biofouling regulating microorganism based fouling is currently impossible due to a lack of in depth understanding reversible fouling which involves the loose attachment of foulants on the membrane surface is removable by chemical reagents that interfere with bacterial biofilm formation wang et al 2014 yamamura et al 2007 on the other hand irreversible fouling remains on the surface even after physical and chemical cleaning due to the strong attachment of the fouling layer formed during long term use therefore irreversible membrane fouling during wastewater treatment remains a technically difficult issue because such fouling is strongly resistant to a variety of chemical and physical cleaning methods consequently the irreversible fouling mechanism needs to be better understood to mitigate membrane fouling numerous microorganisms are involved in the irreversible fouling process in wastewater reclamation plants meng et al 2017 zhan et al 2020 microbial flocs in biofilms secrete extracellular polymeric substances epss that are mainly responsible for irreversible fouling wang et al 2009 weinrich et al 2016 the epss produced by cells are macromolecular mixtures that are mainly composed of polysaccharides proteins humic substances and lipids among other as extracellular matrices they contribute to microbial adhesion and cell proliferation salama et al 2016 seviour et al 2019 therefore understanding the biological properties of the eps is a prerequisite for developing cleaning strategies and mitigating membrane fouling de vries et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 both genetic control at the cellular level and environmental factors highly regulate the formation of the eps matrix flemming et al 2023 however signaling between microbes at the cellular level in wastewater and the fouling inducing molecules are insufficiently understood as multiple and species specific systems are involved for example quorum sensing is the well known intercellular signal mechanism that is universally involved in microbial communication galloway et al 2011 shrout and nerenberg 2012 and n acylhomoserine lactone is a key molecule that regulates biofouling gene expression in a microbial network dong et al 2001 wang et al 2021 in the signal transduction pathway of other species intracellular secondary messengers like cyclic di guanosine 5 monophosphate c di gmp and small rnas are considered the main bacterial regulators wolska et al 2016 among eps matrix produced by the signaling between microbes at the cellular level extracellular proteins are more abundant than other fouling components and enhance microbial aggregation by acting as enzymes ligands agonists or structural proteins zhang et al 2019 eps proteins can be determined by proteomic analysis that usually involves gel based methods and lc ms ms park and helm 2008 silva et al 2012 zhang et al 2019 zhou et al 2015 used proteomics to analyze proteins at different transmembrane pressures using two dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 2d page and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry maldi tof ms however 2d page based analyzes are unable to detect unstained proteins or types of protein that are not mobile in the 2d gel and the use of maldi tof ms to detect small peptides is somewhat limited due to strong background signals from abundant matrix molecules used in the ionization process rabilloud et al 2009 therefore the fouling inducing proteins in the eps need to be identified at the proteomic level using gel free electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry esi ms ms to better understand the mechanism responsible for irreversible membrane fouling in addition the identified peptides involved in microbial attachment and biofilm formation on the membrane surface are important for controlling membrane fouling however to the best of our knowledge eps peptides have not been revealed using gel free based esi ms ms in this study we aimed to better understand microbial communication associated with irreversible fouling in wastewater by identifying the proteins involved in fouling fo membranes and revealing their functions we initially monitored changes in the microbial communities and amino acid composition in the biofilm with and without disinfectant after which the entire proteome of the eps was analyzed using gel free methods lc ms ms and a customized database of microbial communities and biofilm associated proteins finally the fouling characteristics of the candidate peptide identified by genomic and proteomic analyzes were evaluated to validate their fouling functions the peptide identified in this study is useful for understanding the fouling process in membrane based water treatment applications and the understanding of peptide functions gained can be used to combat irreversible fouling by mitigating cellular interactions in addition our methodology provides a versatile strategy for antifouling research 2 materials and

identified peptide peptide synthesis with 95 purity was performed by cosmogenetech seoul korea there were two different biofilm formation assays biofilms on a peptide coated membrane and biofilms with soluble peptide an iglsslpr peptide coated membrane was used to examine the biofilm formed on its surface a reverse osmosis ro membrane was coated with the peptide using the edc nhs method huang et al 2017 the membrane was washed with ethanol and di water and activated in 2 n morpholino ethanesulfonic acid mes buffer containing 0 1 mol l edc and 0 5 w v nhs the membrane was stored at 37 c for 1 h and washed with di water a 1 mg ml solution of peptide in pbs was added to the membrane and allowed to stand at room temperature for 2 h the coated membrane was then washed with di water the biofilm was formed on punch cut sections with 5 mm diameter of the coated membrane using p alcaligenes which was grown in lb broth at 37 c for 24 h after which the cell suspension was diluted to an od600 of 0 02 in m9 broth containing 20 glucose 1 m cacl2 1 m mgso4 and 1 mg ml thiamin hcl the cell suspension and coated membrane sections were added to the wells of a 96 well plate and incubated at 37 c for 24 h the cell suspensions were then removed and the membranes pieces were washed with di water to remove planktonic cells the biofilms formed on each membrane section were stained with 0 1 w v crystal violet 200 µl for 15 min the membrane pieces were then rinsed with di water and dried ethanol 200 µl was then added and stored for 15 min at room temperature after which absorbance was measured at 595 nm biofilms formed in the plate wells when the peptide was dissolved in suspension were analyzed by adding diluted cells and the peptide solution to the wells of a 96 well plate to a final concentration of 1 mg ml the plate was then incubated at 37 c for 24 h and then washed with deionized di water and dried the biofilm in each well was stained with 0 1 w v crystal violet for 15 min and washed with di water ethanol 200 µl 95 was added to the dyed plate and incubated at room temperature for 15 min after which absorbance was measured at 595 nm 2 10 fouling characteristics an xle 2540 thin film composite dow midland mi usa was used as the model ro membrane a membrane coated with iglsslpr peptide and poly l lysine pll mw 5000 sk bioland s korea using the edc nhs method described above was used to examine fouling characteristics fouling experiments were performed using a laboratory scale cross flow test unit as previously described choi et al 2022 briefly the ro membrane was cut and placed in a 7 7 2 6 0 3 cm stainless steel frame permeate flux was continuously measured using a digital scale connected to a computer and then recirculated back to the feed using a siphon while the retentate was directly recirculated back to the feed tank the cross flow velocity and operating pressure were adjusted to 10 cm s and 7 bar respectively the fouling procedure involved a feed water volume of 2 l and the initial flux was measured using a bacterium free synthetic wastewater effluent solution under the abovementioned operating conditions kwan et al 2015 fouling was initiated by adding 106 cells ml of pseudomonas alcaligenes and carried out to a recovery ratio of 10 equivalent to 200 ml of permeate a 1 cm2 area of each membrane was subsequently examined using a confocal laser scanning microscope clsm lsm 880 with airyscan carl zeiss germany the biofilm on the membrane was stained with 3 34 mm syto9 and 20 mm pi according to the manufacturer s instructions stained samples were kept at room temperature for 15 min and washed three times with 0 9 nacl before mounting five areas were observed by clsm and cell biovolumes were determined using biofilmq software 2 11 adhesion characteristics an atomic force microscope afm bruker santa barbara ca usa was used to analyze the adhesion characteristics of peptide coated membranes briefly a commercial sin probe with a 2 μm borosilicate glass particle attached to the tip of a cantilever with a spring constant of 0 06 n m novascan ia usa was used afm adhesion forces between the glass particle and the bare pll coated and iglsslpr coated membranes were determined using the liquid drop merge method in a fluid cell by merging electrolyte solutions containing 8 5 mm nacl and 0 5 mm cacl2 as previously described park et al 2023 forces were measured following 30 min of equilibration in each case the afm instrument was operated in force mode with a piezo movement approach retraction speed of 0 5 μm s and 0 5 μm of piezo movement forces were measured at five locations with at least 12 values acquired at each location 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term operation of a pilot scale fo system fig s1 shows a pilot scale fo system for wastewater reclamation that contains two fo membrane modules one is operated with a wastewater effluent containing 10 mg l of monochloramine mca a disinfectant used to control biofilm development on the fo membrane and the other with a disinfectant free feed solution the change in water flux during the long term operation of fo process in both conditions are depicted in the fig 1 a each membrane was chemically cleaned using commercial acidic and alkaline chemical cleaning agents when the water flux had declined by 30 compared to its initial value in case of the control experiment w o mca the water flux was not completely restored even after multiple chemical cleaning procedures during the fo operation as shown in fig 1a specifically the water flux levels only reached 70 0 of the initial water flux after the first cleaning procedure and subsequent cleaning procedures did not demonstrate any improvement in cleaning effectiveness fouling during forward osmosis is a well established reversible process compared to that of a pressurized system however irreversible fouling is inevitable when feed water with an extremely high potential of fouling by inorganic and organic materials and bacteria is treated xie et al 2015 on the other hand the reduction in water flux during the fo process was considerably postponed and the recovery of flux was greatly enhanced up to 92 3 of the initial water flux level by introducing mca as a biocide as compared to the control experiment this delay is ascribable to the oxidation of organic foulants as well as the disinfecting ability of mca xue et al 2014 previous studies have also reported that mca is relatively stable and inhibits biofouling without degrading the polyamide structure do et al 2012 park et al 2020 even though better flux recovery was observed when mca was used compared to that observed for the mca free scenario the initial water flux was not recovered which indicates that irreversible fouling occurs even in the presence of mca a schematic depiction of the long term operation of the pilot scale fo process in the presence and absence of mca as well as the occurrence of irreversible fouling under both conditions irrespective of chemical cleaning is presented in fig 1b 3 2 composition of microbial community the operational taxonomic units otus at the phylum and genus levels of the two eps samples reveal that mca based disinfection affects the bacterial communities present as shown in fig 2 bacteroidetes 22 8 acidobacteria 20 0 proteobacteria 17 7 and nitrospirae 16 6 are the abundant phyla in the mca untreated system while proteobacteria 62 7 actinobacteria 5 8 and bacteroidetes 3 1 are the major phyla when treated with mca fig 2a clearly proteobacteria are predominant in each sample these bacteria have been reported to constitute the main populations on fouled membranes nagaraj et al 2017 rehman et al 2019 hence the proteobacteria phylum is expected to enhance biofilm communities and survive in membrane based wastewater plants during irreversible fouling disinfection was observed to simplify the overall dominant bacterial phyla compared to the mca free case bacteroidetes were largely absent and a larger quantity of actinobacteria were observed after mca treatment unlike proteobacteria and bacteroidetes actinobacteria are gram positive bacteria that are more resistant to external chemical stresses than gram negative bacteria because they have thicker peptidoglycan layers mai prochnow et al 2016 song et al 2018 hence actinobacteria may form a protective extracellular matrix within the biofilm community the otu results reveal that the proteobacteria and actinobacteria in the eps are likely to be more resistive to various stresses such as disinfection thereby inducing irreversible fouling on the membrane by attaching to microbes and surviving in the bacterial community at the genus level stenotrophobacter 18 79 ohtaekwangia 17 54 nitrospira 16 59 were abundant in the mca untreated system while pseudomonas 18 84 acidovorax 10 17 were detected in the mca treated system fig 2b these abundant genera and species were used to create the customized database and single strain system 3 3 quantitative eps comparisons to understand how disinfection affects proteins and to characterize the fouling inducing proteins we analyzed the protein concentrations and amino acid compositions of the eps the eps formed in the presence of mca contained significantly less protein compared to that formed in the absence of mca 69 91 vs 152 43 µg ml fig 3 a however the proteins remaining in the eps formed in the presence of mca are expected to result in strong biofouling during disinfection fig 3b shows that alanine aspartic acid asparagine glycine and glutamic acid glutamine account for 17 26 11 9 10 19 and 10 12 of the untreated eps composition and 16 87 12 25 10 52 and 7 12 of the mca treated eps these levels were found to be much higher than those of other amino acids the total proportions of amino acids are consistent with the cellular amino acid abundances previously reported for microorganisms in various environments moura et al 2013 in addition similar overall amino acid compositions were observed irrespective of disinfection which indicates that the membrane disinfection process does not remove specific amino acids in the eps and that the unremoved proteins on the fouled membrane originate from microorganisms these remaining proteins are important components that induce irreversible biofouling during disinfection 3 4 identification of eps proteins by ms the eps proteomes were analyzed using lc ms ms and the gel free method to identify whole eps proteins metagenome sequencing bacterial proteins c di gmp associated pilz and pled and pilus fimh and papg proteins were used as a customized database table 1 a which lists proteins with p values greater than 20 reveals that the highest p values in the mca treated group correspond to the tonb dependent receptors of pararheinheimera mesophila tonb systems play roles in transporting nutrients siderophores saccharides and aromatic compounds across the outer membrane fujita et al 2019 this transport is regulated by quorum sensing in paracoccus denitrificans fujita et al 2019 moreover the atp binding cassette abc transporter substrate binding proteins of comamonas aquatica and pseudomonas alcaligenes were also identified these two species are included in proteobacteria which is the major phyla of the eps the polysaccharide structure is assembled in the cytoplasm and exported through the abc transporter dependent pathway willis and whitfield 2013 the abc transporter is an important factor for biofilm formation and irreversible attachment hinsa et al 2003 fimbrial proteins were found in the epss formed in the absence and presence of mca in the fimh and papg cases fimh is an adhesive bacterial pilus protein that controls adhesion by acting as a lectin that binds to mannose schembri et al 2001 tchesnokova et al 2011 the identified proteins which are located on the outer membrane and are exposed to the external environment are expected to increase tolerance to environmental chemicals table 1b lists peptides ordered by intensity 107 including peptide p values coverage intensity and protein description intensity can be interpreted as peptide concentration and can be used to highlight dominant proteins atpase and glycosyltransferases have been identified in the bacterial protein database glycosyltransferase is a polymerase that forms glycosidic linkages and transfers sugar moieties therefore it enhances the polysaccharide quantities in the eps and modulates interactions between biofilm matrix components katherine et al 2019 among abundant peptides with intensities greater than 107 the pilz domain containing proteins exhibited the largest values 1 79 108 and 7 90 107 in the mca untreated and treated systems respectively the pilz protein binds to c di gmp which is the second signal messenger that controls bacterial motility and sessility pilz domain containing proteins such as alg44 found in p aeruginosa are involved in c di gmp dependent extracellular polysaccharide production merighi et al 2007 3 5 analysis of abundant peptides fig 4 a and b display 3d rt m z intensity diagrams that express precursor peptides identified in the mca untreated and treated groups peak intensities are color coded and dominant peptides are confirmed based on their intensity values most peptides exhibited intensity values of less than 1 50 107 highlighted in black in both the mca untreated and treated groups the peaks marked with asterisks in fig 4a and b correspond to iglsslpr which was detected both w o mca and w mca the peptide had the highest intensity value as mentioned in table 1b the tandem mass spectra for this peptide are shown in fig 4c and d and the peptide sequence has an m z of 421 76 and is doubly charged z 2 iglsslpr is a peptide of the pilz domain containing protein in methylobacterium which is of the order rhizobiales that is the fourth most abundant in the epss formed in the absence 9 52 and presence 0 17 of mca in addition the peptide was identified to have the highest area value in both eps sets hence a large number of proteins remain following sterilization pilz domains bind to c di gmp and their levels controls bacterial behavior consequently these proteins exhibit important functions through protein protein interactions including alginate synthesis cellulose synthesis and flagellar activity hengge 2009 as these proteins are associated with the bacterial signaling system and because iglsslpr dominates both eps sets it is expected be a critical signaling factor for cell cell interactions or surface cell interactions during membrane fouling a microbial system study involving the identified peptides is required to understand bacterial behavior in the biofilm environment 3 6 relationship between the iglsslpr peptide and microbial biofilm the complexity of eps proteins in wastewater necessitated a single strain experiment to increase the reliability of peptide identification using a clear database we evaluated whether or not the pilz associated proteins and iglsslpr motif found in wastewater exist under conditions of microbial biofilm formation two types of microorganisms were used as model species p alcaligenes which was predominantly found in the microbial community of the w mca sample as shown in table s2 was used as the first model species m iners which contains the iglsnlpr motif of pilz domain containing proteins was used as the second fig s2 m iners was used to confirm the presence of the peptide under biofilm formation conditions biofilms were assayed under two environmental factors shaking and static conditions to evaluate whether the pilz protein and iglsslpr peptide were identified under conditions where biofilms formed well p alcaligenes and m iners biofilms are shown in fig 5 a and b respectively both model species formed less biofilm when shaken than under static conditions however the bacteria grew faster when shaken fig s3 fig 5c shows that while pilz associated proteins were identified for both p alcaligenes and m iners under shaking and static conditions in the presence of biofilms the iglsnlpr motif was found only in m iners grown under static conditions fig 5d which indicates that the peptide is found under conditions where more biofilm is formed in a manner that is independent of the presence of pilz proteins additional experiments that include both rnaseq and expressed gene difference techniques are needed to determine the effect of the motif on bacterial attachment and membrane fouling in addition the mechanism by which the identified iglsslpr peptide affects microbial biofilm formation was examined using a model species p alcaligenes a major bacterial species found in the fouling layer of the mca treated system table s2 was used to assay biofilm formation biofilms were examined on the peptide coated membrane and in the peptide cell suspension more biofilm was observed when iglsslpr was present on the peptide immobilized membrane surface while less biofilm formed when the peptide was present in the cell suspension fig 6 which suggests that the peptide coated membrane surface promotes bacterial attachment and this attachment is inhibited when the peptide is present in the cell suspension this is similar to the functioning of the arg gly asp rgd peptide that is well known in mammalian cell cultures the rgd peptide is found in extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin which induces mammalian cell adhesion and settlement has become a key peptide for tissue engineering nicol et al 1992 pierschbacher and ruoslahti 1984 similar to the rgd peptide found in fibronectin the iglsslpr peptide with cell attachment properties will have an impact on fouling 3 7 adhesion characteristics of the peptide we used afm to better understand the adhesion characteristics of the discovered peptide by determining the adhesion forces between the cantilever bearing a 2 μm borosilicate glass particle and the bare pll coated and iglsslpr coated membranes fig 7 b d positively charged pll was used as the positive control fragment because most bacterial membranes have net negative charges and therefore attract microbes through long range electrostatic interactions compared to iglsslpr pll is strongly hydrophilic owing to its positive charge as shown in fig 7a the pll and iglsslpr coated membranes exhibited significantly stronger adhesion forces to the glass particle 0 637 0 355 and 0 640 0 280 mn m respectively than the bare membrane 0 221 0 097 mn m the strong adhesion observed for the pll coated membrane is not surprising given that pll is widely used to attach bacterial cells to glass or polymeric surfaces through electrostatic interactions associated with its positively charged nature colville et al 2010 on the other hand the iglsslpr coated membrane adhered to the glass particle as strongly as the pll coated system therefore the discovered peptide using its strong adhesion characteristics can be utilized as a glue to form mechanically stable flocs or granules in such environmental engineering processes 3 8 fouling characteristics of the peptide to accurately determine the effect of the peptide identified based on its biofouling potential dynamic biofouling assays were conducted using a lab scale cross flow ro unit with bare pll coated and iglsslpr coated membranes synthetic wastewater effluent medium was used as the feed solution and p alcaligenes was added at an initial concentration of 106 cells ml water flux gradually declined over a permeate volume of 200 ml due to the attachment of bacteria to the membrane flux was observed to decline by 15 as 200 ml of permeate was passed through the bare membrane which is ascribable to bacterial attachment whereas the analogous fluxes of the pll coated and iglsslpr coated membranes declined by 18 and 20 respectively which suggests that iglsslpr induces bacterial attachment fig 8 a to better understand the role of the iglsslpr peptide in enhancing bacterial attachment the membrane was removed from the cell at a 10 recovery ratio and analyzed using confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm for detection of live and dead cells in the biofilm on the membrane syto9 and propidium iodide pi were used which stain live cells green and dead cells red respectively stiefel et al 2015 three dimensional 3 d views of the three biofilms reveal structural differences between those developed on the bare pll coated and iglsslpr coated membranes fig 8c the biofilm layer on the pll coated and iglsslpr coated membranes appear to cover the entire membrane area whereas bacteria are only partially attached to the bare membrane the total cell biovolume per area of each biofilm was determined from the clsm image the biofilm developed on the iglsslpr coated membrane after recovering 10 of the feed solution was observed to be dense and composed of more cells 0 554 0 019 μm3 μm 2 compared to that formed on the bare membrane 0 212 0 018 μm3 μm 2 fig 8b the bacterial attachment was only slightly lower for iglsslpr coated membranes compared to the pll coated membrane 0 603 0 045 μm3 μm 2 we conclude that bacterial attachment to the iglsslpr coated membrane surface is enhanced by the strong adhesion characteristics of iglsslpr among eps proteins the iglsslpr pilz domain containing peptide was found to be dominant and was subsequently shown to induce biofilm formation and enhance bacterial attachment to the membrane surface owing to its exceptional adhesion characteristics which are comparable to those of pll that operates through strong electrostatic interactions therefore the peptide discovered in this study can be used to understand microbial fouling phenomena and develop antifouling technology through the use of antagonists that counter the fouling mechanism 4 conclusion in this study we analyzed the microbiomes and proteomes of epss on fo membranes during long term operation in a pilot scale system under irreversible fouling conditions unknown peptides on the fo were identified and their functions were evaluated to better understand the irreversible fouling phenomenon the conclusions are as follows the application of mca reduced the quantity of eps proteins present in the system by inhibiting microbial activity rather than a specific amino acid residue nevertheless the remaining amino acid compositions were marginal to the mca free process which indicates that epss produced from microorganisms are strongly attached to the membrane even in the presence of a disinfectant which is the main cause of irreversible fouling eps proteins from wastewater were identified using lc ms ms and a customized database during proteomic analysis which led to the discovery of the iglsslpr peptide which is a part of the pilz domain containing protein in addition the iglsnlpr peptide was identified when a biofilm was developed using m iners as a model bacterium enhanced bacterial attachment was observed when the membrane surface was coated with iglsslpr whereas iglsslpr inhibited bacterial attachment when suspended in the medium the iglsslpr peptide is expected to be useful for the further development of antifouling technology the iglsslpr adheres to membrane surfaces as strongly as pll which adheres through electrostatic interactions therefore it promoted biofouling with the model microbes the discovered peptide induces microbial aggregation when co suspended with the model bacterium owing to its adhesion characteristics declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

14729,rivers are considered as an important source of methane ch4 to the atmosphere but our understanding for the methanogenic pathway in rivers and its linkage with ch4 emission is very limited here we investigated the diffusive flux of ch4 and its stable carbon isotope signature δ13c ch4 along the river estuary continuum of the yangtze river the diffusive ch4 flux was estimated to 27 9 11 4 μmol m2 d and 36 5 24 4 μmol m2 d in wet season and dry season respectively the δ13c ch4 values were generally lower than 60 with the fractionation factor α c higher than 1 055 and the isotope separation factor εc ranged from 55 to 100 in situ microbial composition showed that hydrogenotrophic methanogens accounts for over 70 of the total reads moreover the incubation test showed that the headspace ch4 concentration by adding co2 h2 to the sediment was orders of magnitude higher than that by adding trimethylamine and sodium acetate these results jointly verified the river estuary continuum is a minor ch4 source and dominated by hydrogenotrophic pathway based on the methanogenic pathway here and previous reported data in the same region the historical variation of diffusive ch4 flux was calculated and results showed that ch4 emission has reduced 82 5 since the construction of three gorges dam tgd our study verified the dominant methanogenic pathway in river ecosystems and clarified the effect and mechanism of dam construction on riverine ch4 emission graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords methanogenic pathway diffusive flux stable carbon isotope microbial community river estuary continuum data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction methane ch4 a potent greenhouse gas which is 28 times more effective than carbon dioxide co2 on a centennial timescale has approximately triply increased in the atmosphere from the pre industrial era to now tollefson 2022 although only covering 0 58 of earth s nonglaciated land surface allen and pavelsky 2018 rivers play a key role in carbon delivery and transformation in aquatic networks furtherly leading to a 30 5 tg year of ch4 emission to the atmosphere rosentreter et al 2021 stanley et al 2016 moreover since the mid 20th century the increased use of hydropower has driven a surge in dam construction lehner et al 2011 and at least 3700 major dams are either planned or under construction in global rivers zarfl et al 2014 dams can impede carbon transport and undoubtably impact ch4 biogeochemical cycling making riverine ch4 emission more uncertain maavara et al 2020 therefore understanding the mechanisms underlying ch4 emissions from rivers especially with the effect of dam construction is critical to assess the global ch4 budget and predict future climate change it has been reported that microbes are responsible for nearly 85 of the consistent growth in ch4 emission tollefson 2022 up to now methanogens affiliate exclusively to few phyla including euryarchaeota costa and leigh 2014 thermoplasmata poulsen et al 2013 bathyarchaeota evans et al 2015 and verstraetearchaeota vanwonterghem et al 2016 although a novel alkylotrophic methanogen was recently found in a subsurface oil reservoir and verified to produce ch4 when degrading long chain alkanes zhou et al 2022 methanogens in aquatic ecosystems can generally be classified into three major types based on the substrate usage including the hydrogenotrophic methylotrophic and acetoclastic methanogens lyu et al 2018 hydrogenotrophic methanogens use co2 as the sole electron acceptor to produce ch4 by oxidizing hydrogen h2 as the electron donor eq 1 costa and leigh 2014 due to the larger kinetic isotopic effect associated with hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis the resulting δ13c ch4 can be as low as 110 to 60 whiticar 1999 methylotrophic methanogens catabolize methylated compounds like methanol and trimethylamine and eventually reduce them to ch4 by using electrons donated from h2 or the methyl groups eq 2 garcia et al 2022 acetoclastic methanogens are the special case of methylotrophic methanogens which split acetate and reduce methyl group to ch4 with electrons donated from oxidation of the carboxyl moiety to co2 eq 3 ferry 1999 the lower fractionation associated with the methylotrophic including acetoclastic methanogenesis leads to a relatively enriched δ13c ch4 60 to 50 thottathil and prairie 2021 whiticar 1999 therefore identifying the isotopic signature of the dissolved ch4 is important in the inverse modeling to clarify and assign ch4 sources and their

varied significantly by isotopic signature analysis conrad 2020 thermodynamically both hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogenesis are inhibited by sulfate reduction due to the corresponding methanogens are out competed for h2 and acetate by sulfate reducing bacteria oremland and polcin 1982 in contrast methylotrophic methanogens bypass the competition by using non competitive methylated compounds in the sulfate reduction zone zhuang et al 2016 consequently previous studies have shown that hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic pathways dominate methanogenesis in freshwater ecosystems due to the low content of both sulfate and methylated compounds yang et al 2020 whereas methylotrophic methanogenesis is the major pathway in marine and hypersaline sediments lyu et al 2018 where the sulfate concentration are orders of magnitude higher than that in the freshwaters zak et al 2020 however methylotrophic methanogens have been increasingly found in freshwaters implying that the corresponding pathway might be previously overlooked yang et al 2020 a recent study further showed that algal bloom could excrete large amount of methyl thioethers and facilitated methylotrophic methanogenesis in freshwaters zhou et al 2021 therefore methanogenic pathway in freshwater ecosystems may be more complex than previously thought although isotopic analysis for δ13c ch4 has been applied to evaluate methanogenic pathway in several freshwater ecosystems such as wetlands and lakes zhang et al 2019 miller et al 2022 our understanding for the methanogenic pathway in rivers and its linkage with riverine ch4 emission is still constrained river estuary continuum is the transitional zone between river to oceanic systems gao et al 2022 in this riverine section dam construction in the upper stream may drop down the sediment delivery which means less organic carbon could be furtherly decomposed to methanogenic substrates meanwhile the less deposition of sediment may increase the bed permeability and the vertical flow of o2 to the sediment zhu et al 2022 which may also limit ch4 production however our knowledge for the historical variation of ch4 emission along the river estuary continuum especially under the effect of dam constructions is very poor the only existing study comprehensively assessed the influence of dam construction on riverine ch4 emission by using artificial neural networks anns whereas the methanogenic pathways were not taken into consideration ni et al 2022 studying the methanogenic pathway then building the relationship between corresponding methanogenic substrate and ch4 flux seems to be a feasible way to clarify the historical variation of ch4 emission here we investigated the dissolved ch4 concentration diffusive ch4 flux δ13c ch4 and in situ methanogen composition along the river estuary continuum of the yangtze river then various substrates were amended with the sediment to verify the dominant methanogenic pathway based on the methanogenic pathway and historical data of partial pressure of co2 pco2 at the same region the temporal variation of diffusive ch4 flux was obtained from 1990 to now our study will expand the knowledge of methanogenic pathway in river estuary continuum and clarify the effect and mechanism of dam construction on ch4 emission in the downstream 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and field sampling the yangtze river is the third longest river in the world and longest river in china with a total mainstream length of 6300 km yang et al 2018 the river is divided into three segments the upper reach originates from qinghai tibet plateau to yichang the middle reach runs between yichang and hukou and the lower reach runs from hukou to the estuary wang et al 2008 in the present study the river estuary continuum of the yangtze river includes the riverine sections in jiangsu province and shanghai city where the dense population and prosperous industrial belt induce large amount of organic carbon flow into the river potentially providing sufficient substrates for methanogenesis in the past three decades the construction of several large dams has significantly changed the flow regime of the yangtze river wang et al 2016 the world s largest dam the three gorges dam tgd is located at the boundary between the upper and middle reaches it initially intercepted the river in 1997 commenced the operation in 2003 and has operated at full capacity since the end of 2008 fu et al 2010 zhang et al 2014 moreover the tgd has greatly altered river hydrology and sediment delivery to the river estuary continuum of the yangtze river yang et al 2018 in this study both surface water 50 cm below the surface and sediment samples in a total of 18 sections were collected by using an automatic sampler in the river estuary continuum of the yangtze river in wet june and dry november season in 2021 fig 1 the automatic sampler consists of a water sampler and a channel sediment driller equipped with an elliptical type weight fig s1 only midstream of the channel pelagic zone at each section was sampled in wet season whereas both the midstream of the channel and the right bank

water temperature t dissolved oxygen do conductivity ph and salinity 2 2 diffusive ch4 flux to the atmosphere along the river estuary continuum of the yangtze river the dissolved ch4 concentration in the surface water were analyzed by using a modified headspace equilibration method shi et al 2017 followed by transforming the headspace ch4 concentration to the dissolved values goldenfum 2010 specifically a 300 ml of the surface water was collected in a 500 ml air tight polypropylene syringe equipped with a three way stopcock followed by 200 ml of a mixing gas n2 o2 78 22 v v adding to the syringe to create a headspace then the sample syringe was shaken vigorously for 2 min and was left to stand for 30 min finally the equilibrated headspace gas was injected into a 200 ml pre evacuated airbag both ch4 and co2 in the mixing gas were confirmed to be absent before use the diffusive ch4 flux to the atmosphere was calculated according to liss and slater 1974 4 f c h 4 k c h 4 m c h 4 c w

2021 the fractionation factor α c calculated by the ratio between δ13c σco2 and δ13c ch4 can determine the methanogenic pathways generally hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis is the dominant pathway when α c 1 055 whereas the methylotrophic including acetoclastic methanogenesis is the dominant pathway when α c 1 055 whiticar 1999 the α c was estimated according to the following equation flury and

methanogenic pathways generally hydrogenotrophic methanogenic is the dominant pathway when εc ranges from 49 to 100 in comparison the methylotrophic methanogenic is the dominant pathway when εc ranges from 40 to 55 whiticar 1999 the εc was estimated according to the following equation miller et al 2022 whiticar 1999 9 ε c δ 13 c σ c o 2 δ 13 c c h 4 2 4 dna extraction and community composition of

adding various substrates to verify the dominant methanogenic pathway according to the δ13c ch4 signatures three sites sampled at the pelagic zone during dry season were selected to conduct the incubation tests these three sites contain the higher median and lower value within the δ13c ch4 range at yz4 62 7 yz9 88 5 and yz17 105 respectively trimethylamine tma 10 mmol l sodium acetate naac

determined by a t test relationships between dissolved co2 and ch4 concentration as well as sediment discharge and pco2 were analyzed by correlation analysis all the statistical analysis were conducted by r 3 5 2 and origin 2017 3 results 3 1 physiochemical characteristics in the water column along the river estuary continuum of the yangtze river generally the river water presented a high homogeneity in the same sampling period a shallower water depth but higher ss no2 n and nh4 n contents were present in sites near the estuary yz17 yz18 whereas no significant variation of other physiochemical characteristics was observed among sites during both wet season and dry season moreover during dry season no significant difference was observed between pelagic and littoral zone except for water depth however a significant difference was observed between wet season and dry season specifically water temperature water depth ss and no2 n in the wet season was 26 3 0 3 c 24 2 10 7 m 114 359 mg l and 10 6 10 3 μg l respectively significantly higher than that in the dry season however do doc nh4 n tp po4 3 and dissolved co2 in the wet season was 7 8 0 4 mg l 2 8 0 1 mg l 13 8 13 7 μg l 0 03 0 00 mg l 0 02 0 00 mg l and 15 7 5 0 μmol l respectively significantly lower than that in the dry season table s1 3 2 distribution patterns of dissolved ch4 concentration diffusive ch4 flux and δ13c ch4 along the river estuary continuum of the yangtze river in the wet season ch4 concentration in the surface water ranged from 11 0 nmol l to 53 7 nmol l with an average value of 32 7 10 9 nmol l fourteen of the sixteen sites in yz1 yz16 were stabilized in 30 40 nmol l whereas sharply decreased to 15 8 20 1 nmol l in the estuary yz17 yz18 in the dry season no obvious ch4 distribution pattern was observed along the river estuary continuum which ranged from 15 7 nmol l to 56 8 nmol l with an average value of 30 3 10 5 nmol l in the pelagic zone and 16 2 nmol l to 74 4 nmol l with an average value of 44 1 19 9 nmol l in the littoral zone fig 2 a the diffusive ch4 flux was 27 9 11 4 μmol m2 d in wet season significantly lower than that in dry season 36 5 24 4 μmol m2 d moreover littoral zone was the hotspot for ch4 emission to the atmosphere where the emission flux reaching 43 9 28 5 μmol m2 d fig 2b nearly all the values of δ13c ch4 in the surface water were between 110 and 60 in both wet season and dry season with average values of 83 2 13 0 during wet season and 94 2 17 2 during dry season moreover the average value of δ13c ch4 in pelagic zone 96 8 16 4 was significantly lower than that in the littoral zone 91 6 18 2 fig 2c table s1 3 3 community composition of methanogens all reads were assigned to the phylum euryarchaeota and furtherly classified into 25 taxonomic groups at genus level eight of the genera average relative abundance 1 at each sampling site accounted for over 80 of all reads the most abundant genus in both pelagic and littoral zone was methanoregula with an average relative abundance of 31 6 in all samples methanothrix methanobacterium and methanocella also comprised a considerable part of the methanogenic community with an average relative abundance of 19 5 13 9 and 6 7 respectively functional annotation by faprotax showed that hydrogenotrophic methanogens dominated in pelagic zone accounting for 74 1 10 1 of the total methanogens followed by acetoclastic and methylotrophic methanogens which corresponded to 24 3 10 8 and 1 6 1 5 respectively a similar proportion was also observed in littoral zone where hydrogenotrophic acetoclastic and methylotrophic methanogens accounted for 75 8 14 6 21 9 14 0 and 2 3 3 7 respectively fig 3 3 4 the variation of ch4 concentration after adding different substrates for methanogenesis similar trends were observed in all three sites after adding different substrates specifically headspace ch4 concentration was significantly increased from near 0 3 μmol l at the beginning to 80 90 μmol l on day 30 when adding h2 co2 while ch4 concentrations were consistently lower than 2 5 μmol l during the whole incubation when adding tma bes and water however a variation was observed when adding naac although no ch4 increase along time at yz4 ch4 started to increase at day 20 and rose to 13 7 μmol l on day 30 at yz9 as for yz17 ch4 concentration consistently increased to 31 4 μmol l on day 30 fig 4 3 5 the estimation of ch4 emission since the construction of the three gorge dam tgd based on the relationship between dissolved co2 concentration and ch4 concentration in the present study we constructed the historical variation of diffusive ch4 flux from 1990 to 2021 result showed that the diffusive ch4 flux was significantly increased from 110 μmol m2 d in 1990 to 345 μmol m2 d in 1997 the time point that the tgd initially intercepted the river then largely decreased to 60 0 μmol m2 d until 2003 the time point that the tgd commenced the operation and stabilized thereafter 4 discussion 4 1 the river estuary continuum of the yangtze river is a minor source of ch4 to the atmosphere freshwater ecosystems play a critical role in global carbon budget and multiple studies have investigated ch4 emission in lakes beaulieu et al 2019 wetlands dingemans et al 2011 reservoirs johnson et al 2021 and ponds holgerson and raymond 2016 however our knowledge on ch4 emission in rivers especially in river estuary continuum is still constrained here we found that the dissolved ch4 concentrations in surface water along the river estuary continuum of the third longest river in the word was consistently oversaturated with respect to atmospheric equilibrium fig 2a making the diffusive ch4 flux reaching 27 9 11 4 μmol m2 d and 36 5 24 4 μmol m2 d in wet season and dry season respectively fig 2b compared with other large rivers ch4 emission in this study is significantly lower than that in amazonian rivers 1400 μmol m2 d sawakuchi et al 2014 and yukon river 70 1350 μmol m2 d striegl et al 2012 but within the range of yellow river estuary 24 8 301 8 μmol m2 d song and liu 2015 and one order magnitude higher than that in mississippi river 4 2 μmol m2 d crawford et al 2016 compared with different types of ecosystems the diffusive ch4 flux in this study is several orders of magnitude lower than global average emission for freshwater lakes 7 1 3 1 mmol m2 d johnson et al 2022 wetlands 10 4 1 0 mmol m2 d pasut et al 2021 and rice paddy 2 1 4 4 mmol m2 d zhang et al 2016 consequently the river estuary continuum of yangtze river is a minor source of ch4 to the atmosphere our estimates did not account for the ebullitive efflux that has been considered as a major pathway for ch4 emission in the upper reaches of the yangtze river zhang et al 2020 and some freshwater lakes wang et al 2021 however previous study has shown that ebullition most frequently occurs at sites with a shallow depth less than 6 m west et al 2016 here the average water depth was over 20 m significantly deeper than that in the upper reaches with a depth of only 0 34 2 59 m zhang et al 2020 the deeper water depth is unfavorable for ebullition formation because it s hard for the ch4 bubble pressure to overcome atmospheric and hydrostatic pressure langenegger et al 2019 thus we speculate that ch4 emission is dominated by a diffusive pathway in the river estuary continuum of the yangtze river despite the recognized significance of ch4 ebullition in shallower sites 4 2 hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis is the major pathway along the river estuary continuum of the yangtze river hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic pathways have been well described to dominate methanogenesis in lakes and wetland in most cases but our knowledge for methanogenic pathway in rivers is limited so far therefore clarifying the methanogenic pathway is important for the construction of process based models prediction of future ch4 emission strength and development of strategies for emission reduction in river ecosystems conrad 2020 here we demonstrate that hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis is the major pathway along the river estuary continuum of the yangtze river based on the δ13c ch4 signature analysis methanogen community composition and substrate amendment tests first of all due to the larger kinetic isotopic effect associated with hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis than that associated with the methylotrophic methanogenesis the stable carbon isotope signature of ch4 produced by hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis is generally lower than that produced by methylated fermentation whiticar 1999 here the highly negative values of δ13c ch4 83 2 13 0 and 94 2 17 2 during wet season and dry season respectively were exactly within the range expected for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis 110 to 60 instead of methylotrophic methanogenesis range from 60 to 50 fig 2c hornibrook and aravena 2009 whiticar 1999 additionally the calculated fractionation factor α c also showed that nearly all the values of α c were over 1 055 fig 2d a typical range of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis nugent et al 2021 it has been demonstrated that the signature of δ13c ch4 is also influenced by ch4 oxidation miller et al 2022 wherein the isotopically light ch4 is preferentially consumed resulting for a progressive enrichment of the residual ch4 in δ13c ch4 alperin et al 1988 correlation analysis showed a significant relationship between δ13c ch4 and δ13c σco2 fig 2f indicating that co2 was derived from ch4 oxidation or that ch4 was derived from hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis however the calculated isotope separation factor εc was 73 5 12 8 during wet season and 84 7 16 7 during dry season far away from the ch4 oxidation zone εc 5 30 but gathered in the hydrogenotrophic zone εc 49 100 whiticar 1999 fig 2e suggesting that ch4 was mainly produced by co2 reduction with negligible ch4 oxidation even if microbial ch4 oxidation taken into account the values of δ13c ch4 are supposed to be more negative making that hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis is still the most possible pathway in our study area secondly the obligate hydrogenotrophic methanogens like methanoregula methanobacterium and methanolinea had a considerable proportion of the total methanogen fig 3a b some metabolically versatile methanogens like methanocella and methanosarcina also jointly accounted for near 10 which have been verified to grow with h2 co2 as well as methylated compounds and even carbon monoxide co costa and leigh 2014 rother and metcalfe 2004 although there were still some obligate acetoclastic methanogens such as methanothrix and methanosarcina stams et al 2019 and methylotrophic methanogens such as methanohalobium and methanohalophilus sorokin et al 2022 present hydrogenotrophic methanogens still dominated the methanogen communities according to faprotax fig 3c d moreover δ13c ch4 in the water significantly decreased with the increase of the number of sequences assigned to hydrogenotrophic pathway fig s2 thirdly direct evidence was further obtained from the substrate amendment tests that headspace ch4 concentration by adding co2 h2 was 2 7 700 and 205 683 times higher than that by adding naac and tma at the end of incubation respectively fig 4 collectively hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis is verified to be the dominant pathway along the river estuary continuum of the yangtze river the average loi was only 2 1 1 7 in the whole river estuary continuum table s1 hardly providing sufficient methylated compound including acetate for methylotrophic and acetoclastic methanogens although increasing studies have verified ch4 could also be derived from cyanobacteria under oxic conditions bižić et al 2020 zhao et al 2022 chl a concentrations were consistently lower than 4 μg l table s1 indicating oxic methanogenesis was unlikely to occur in the oxic water column however sufficient dissolved co2 15 7 30 4 μmol l may serve substrates for methanogens making hydrogenotrophic pathway as the dominated methanogenesis in the river estuary continuum correlation analysis further showed that dissolved co2 was indeed significantly correlated with dissolved ch4 concentration figs 5 a s3 4 3 historical changes of diffusive ch4 flux in the river estuary continuum of yangtze river the correlation relationships between co2 and ch4 may consistently present along time due to the following reasons firstly although organic carbon in yangtze river mainly derived from the degradation of organic materials in soil herath et al 2022 no obvious historical changes of δ13c δ15n and the poc pn molecular ratio in particulate organic matters were observed during 1993 2010 gao et al 2012 suggesting little variation of co2 originated from soil water before and after tgd construction secondly the river estuary continuum generally lose water to the aquifers making the groundwater co2 input only contributed 0 3 of the total co2 emitted during 1956 2015 liu et al 2021 thirdly our study showed that ch4 oxidation was negligible in the sediments and water column according to the signature of δ13c ch4 and δ13c co2 fig 2e as well as ch4 oxidation tests supplementary results this may attribute to that the dissolved o2 in the bottom water was also as high as 8 9 mg l and intensely permeable to the sandy bed this characteristic makes ch4 oxidation is easily to be inhibited at low ch4 and high o2 concentrations rudd et al 1976 a previous study also showed only little ch4 oxidation in the river estuary continuum sampled in 2006 zhu et al 2010 therefore the contribution of ch4 oxidation to total co2 seems consistently low fourthly doc concentration stabilized between 80 and 160 μmol l i e 3 52 7 04 mg l in the lower reaches of yangtze river during 1997 2008 zhang et al 2014 in line with that in the present study 2 8 6 5 mg l thus it is reasonable to infer that such content of doc could hardly provide sufficient substrates for methylotrophic and acetoclastic methanogens after permeating into the sediment making hydrogenotrophy also dominated the methanogenic pathway before tgd construction based on the correlation relationships between dissolved co2 and dissolved ch4 concentration as well as a recent study that looked back on the historical variation of pco2 in the whole yangtze river ni et al 2022 we estimated the historical changes of diffusive ch4 flux in the river estuary continuum of yangtze river results showed that the diffusive ch4 flux after 2003 has decreased 82 5 relative to that during 1990 1997 fig 5b this result is similar to the study of ni et al 2020 in which dissolved ch4 flux was calculated from artificial neural networks based on nonlinear relationships among key variables including water temperature t chemical oxygen demand cod do ph no3 and nh4 here dissolved co2 was additionally taken into consideration for tracing historical variation of ch4 emission based on a process based model our study provides a new insight from a microbial perspective on ch4 cycling and it is necessary to take the methanogenic pathway into account when predicting ch4 emission from inland waters in the future recent studies have found that warming and urbanization could exacerbate greenhouse gas emission jansen et al 2022 wang et al 2022 although atmospheric temperature population and gdp have significantly increased in the past 32 years within our study area the unexpected reduction of ch4 emission indicates some other factors responsible for this variation it is noteworthy that a consistent decrease of sediment discharge was also observed during the same timescale especially after 1997 when tgd initially intercepted the river fig s4 previous studies have reported that poc which ranged from 0 5 to 2 5 of total suspended solid wu et al 2007 and significant correlated with pco2 herath et al 2022 in yangtze river were substantially sequestered by dam building li et al 2015 here we also found diffusive co2 was significantly correlated with sediment discharge in recent 25 years fig s5 indicating the construction of tgd may result in the drop of co2 because the hydrogenotrophic pathway dominates methanogenesis the decline of co2 further induced the decrease of ch4 emission in the downstream after the dam construction 5 conclusion in the present study the diffusive ch4 flux along the river estuary continuum was estimated to 27 9 11 4 μmol m2 d and 36 5 24 4 μmol m2 d in wet season and dry season respectively indicating that the river estuary continuum of yangtze river is a minor source of ch4 to the atmosphere nearly all of the δ13c ch4 values were lower than 60 with the fractionation factor α c were higher than 1 055 and the isotope separation factor εc ranged from 55 to 100 in accordance with the isotopic characteristics of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis further evidence was that the headspace ch4 concentration by adding co2 h2 was near three times to two orders of magnitude higher than that by adding naac and tma in the incubation tests moreover over 70 of methanogen communities had a capacity to reduce co2 to produce ch4 these results jointly verified hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was the dominate pathway based on the correlation relationships of dissolved co2 concentration and dissolved ch4 concentration as well as the historical data of pco2 launched by previous study the historical variation of diffusive ch4 flux was calculated and results showed that the diffusive ch4 flux has decreased 82 5 since the

14729,rivers are considered as an important source of methane ch4 to the atmosphere but our understanding for the methanogenic pathway in rivers and its linkage with ch4 emission is very limited here we investigated the diffusive flux of ch4 and its stable carbon isotope signature δ13c ch4 along the river estuary continuum of the yangtze river the diffusive ch4 flux was estimated to 27 9 11 4 μmol m2 d and 36 5 24 4 μmol m2 d in wet season and dry season respectively the δ13c ch4 values were generally lower than 60 with the fractionation factor α c higher than 1 055 and the isotope separation factor εc ranged from 55 to 100 in situ microbial composition showed that hydrogenotrophic methanogens accounts for over 70 of the total reads moreover the incubation test showed that the headspace ch4 concentration by adding co2 h2 to the sediment was orders of magnitude higher than that by adding trimethylamine and sodium acetate these results jointly verified the river estuary continuum is a minor ch4 source and dominated by hydrogenotrophic pathway based on the methanogenic pathway here and previous reported data in the same region the historical variation of diffusive ch4 flux was calculated and results showed that ch4 emission has reduced 82 5 since the construction of three gorges dam tgd our study verified the dominant methanogenic pathway in river ecosystems and clarified the effect and mechanism of dam construction on riverine ch4 emission graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords methanogenic pathway diffusive flux stable carbon isotope microbial community river estuary continuum data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction methane ch4 a potent greenhouse gas which is 28 times more effective than carbon dioxide co2 on a centennial timescale has approximately triply increased in the atmosphere from the pre industrial era to now tollefson 2022 although only covering 0 58 of earth s nonglaciated land surface allen and pavelsky 2018 rivers play a key role in carbon delivery and transformation in aquatic networks furtherly leading to a 30 5 tg year of ch4 emission to the atmosphere rosentreter et al 2021 stanley et al 2016 moreover since the mid 20th century the increased use of hydropower has driven a surge in dam construction lehner et al 2011 and at least 3700 major dams are either planned or under construction in global rivers zarfl et al 2014 dams can impede carbon transport and undoubtably impact ch4 biogeochemical cycling making riverine ch4 emission more uncertain maavara et al 2020 therefore understanding the mechanisms underlying ch4 emissions from rivers especially with the effect of dam construction is critical to assess the global ch4 budget and predict future climate change it has been reported that microbes are responsible for nearly 85 of the consistent growth in ch4 emission tollefson 2022 up to now methanogens affiliate exclusively to few phyla including euryarchaeota costa and leigh 2014 thermoplasmata poulsen et al 2013 bathyarchaeota evans et al 2015 and verstraetearchaeota vanwonterghem et al 2016 although a novel alkylotrophic methanogen was recently found in a subsurface oil reservoir and verified to produce ch4 when degrading long chain alkanes zhou et al 2022 methanogens in aquatic ecosystems can generally be classified into three major types based on the substrate usage including the hydrogenotrophic methylotrophic and acetoclastic methanogens lyu et al 2018 hydrogenotrophic methanogens use co2 as the sole electron acceptor to produce ch4 by oxidizing hydrogen h2 as the electron donor eq 1 costa and leigh 2014 due to the larger kinetic isotopic effect associated with hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis the resulting δ13c ch4 can be as low as 110 to 60 whiticar 1999 methylotrophic methanogens catabolize methylated compounds like methanol and trimethylamine and eventually reduce them to ch4 by using electrons donated from h2 or the methyl groups eq 2 garcia et al 2022 acetoclastic methanogens are the special case of methylotrophic methanogens which split acetate and reduce methyl group to ch4 with electrons donated from oxidation of the carboxyl moiety to co2 eq 3 ferry 1999 the lower fractionation associated with the methylotrophic including acetoclastic methanogenesis leads to a relatively enriched δ13c ch4 60 to 50 thottathil and prairie 2021 whiticar 1999 therefore identifying the isotopic signature of the dissolved ch4 is important in the inverse modeling to clarify and assign ch4 sources and their releasing strength 1 c o 2 4 h 2 c h 4 2 h 2 o 2 4 c h 3 o h 3 c h 4 c o 2 2 h 2 o 3 c h 3 c o o h c h 4 c o 2 it has been found that methanogenic pathway in different kinds of aquatic ecosystems varied significantly by isotopic signature analysis conrad 2020 thermodynamically both hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogenesis are inhibited by sulfate reduction due to the corresponding methanogens are out competed for h2 and acetate by sulfate reducing bacteria oremland and polcin 1982 in contrast methylotrophic methanogens bypass the competition by using non competitive methylated compounds in the sulfate reduction zone zhuang et al 2016 consequently previous studies have shown that hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic pathways dominate methanogenesis in freshwater ecosystems due to the low content of both sulfate and methylated compounds yang et al 2020 whereas methylotrophic methanogenesis is the major pathway in marine and hypersaline sediments lyu et al 2018 where the sulfate concentration are orders of magnitude higher than that in the freshwaters zak et al 2020 however methylotrophic methanogens have been increasingly found in freshwaters implying that the corresponding pathway might be previously overlooked yang et al 2020 a recent study further showed that algal bloom could excrete large amount of methyl thioethers and facilitated methylotrophic methanogenesis in freshwaters zhou et al 2021 therefore methanogenic pathway in freshwater ecosystems may be more complex than previously thought although isotopic analysis for δ13c ch4 has been applied to evaluate methanogenic pathway in several freshwater ecosystems such as wetlands and lakes zhang et al 2019 miller et al 2022 our understanding for the methanogenic pathway in rivers and its linkage with riverine ch4 emission is still constrained river estuary continuum is the transitional zone between river to oceanic systems gao et al 2022 in this riverine section dam construction in the upper stream may drop down the sediment delivery which means less organic carbon could be furtherly decomposed to methanogenic substrates meanwhile the less deposition of sediment may increase the bed permeability and the vertical flow of o2 to the sediment zhu et al 2022 which may also limit ch4 production however our knowledge for the historical variation of ch4 emission along the river estuary continuum especially under the effect of dam constructions is very poor the only existing study comprehensively assessed the influence of dam construction on riverine ch4 emission by using artificial neural networks anns whereas the methanogenic pathways were not taken into consideration ni et al 2022 studying the methanogenic pathway then building the relationship between corresponding methanogenic substrate and ch4 flux seems to be a feasible way to clarify the historical variation of ch4 emission here we investigated the dissolved ch4 concentration diffusive ch4 flux δ13c ch4 and in situ methanogen composition along the river estuary continuum of the yangtze river then various substrates were amended with the sediment to verify the dominant methanogenic pathway based on the methanogenic pathway and historical data of partial pressure of co2 pco2 at the same region the temporal variation of diffusive ch4 flux was obtained from 1990 to now our study will expand the knowledge of methanogenic pathway in river estuary continuum and clarify the effect and mechanism of dam construction on ch4 emission in the downstream 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and field sampling the yangtze river is the third longest river in the world and longest river in china with a total mainstream length of 6300 km yang et al 2018 the river is divided into three segments the upper reach originates from qinghai tibet plateau to yichang the middle reach runs between yichang and hukou and the lower reach runs from hukou to the estuary wang et al 2008 in the present study the river estuary continuum of the yangtze river includes the riverine sections in jiangsu province and shanghai city where the dense population and prosperous industrial belt induce large amount of organic carbon flow into the river potentially providing sufficient substrates for methanogenesis in the past three decades the construction of several large dams has significantly changed the flow regime of the yangtze river wang et al 2016 the world s largest dam the three gorges dam tgd is located at the boundary between the upper and middle reaches it initially intercepted the river in 1997 commenced the operation in 2003 and has operated at full capacity since the end of 2008 fu et al 2010 zhang et al 2014 moreover the tgd has greatly altered river hydrology and sediment delivery to the river estuary continuum of the yangtze river yang et al 2018 in this study both surface water 50 cm below the surface and sediment samples in a total of 18 sections were collected by using an automatic sampler in the river estuary continuum of the yangtze river in wet june and dry november season in 2021 fig 1 the automatic sampler consists of a water sampler and a channel sediment driller equipped with an elliptical type weight fig s1 only midstream of the channel pelagic zone at each section was sampled in wet season whereas both the midstream of the channel and the right bank littoral zone nearly 300 m offshore at each section were sampled in dry season during sampling campaigns a multiparameter water quality probe ysi 6600 yellow springs ohio usa was deployed to measure water temperature t dissolved oxygen do conductivity ph and salinity 2 2 diffusive ch4 flux to the atmosphere along the river estuary continuum of the yangtze river the dissolved ch4 concentration in the surface water were analyzed by using a modified headspace equilibration method shi et al 2017 followed by transforming the headspace ch4 concentration to the dissolved values goldenfum 2010 specifically a 300 ml of the surface water was collected in a 500 ml air tight polypropylene syringe equipped with a three way stopcock followed by 200 ml of a mixing gas n2 o2 78 22 v v adding to the syringe to create a headspace then the sample syringe was shaken vigorously for 2 min and was left to stand for 30 min finally the equilibrated headspace gas was injected into a 200 ml pre evacuated airbag both ch4 and co2 in the mixing gas were confirmed to be absent before use the diffusive ch4 flux to the atmosphere was calculated according to liss and slater 1974 4 f c h 4 k c h 4 m c h 4 c w c eq where f c h 4 k c h 4 and m c h 4 are the diffusive flux transfer velocity and the molar mass of ch4 respectively c w is the measured dissolved ch4 concentration in surface water and c eq is the theoretical dissolved ch4 concentration that is in equilibrium with the atmospheric ch4 concentration at in situ water temperature k c h 4 was estimated from the transfer velocity of co2 under standard conditions k 600 the schmidt number of 600 by using the following equation liss and merlivat 1986 5 k c h 4 k 600 sc 600 n the value of n depends on the wind speed at an elevation of 10 m u

wanninkhof 1992 6 s c 1897 8 114 28 t 3 2902 t 2 0 039061 t 3 the schmidt number of 600 k 600 was calculated by u 10 using the equation of cole and caraco 1998 7 k 600 2 07 0 215 u 10 1 7 wherein the daily average values of u 10 during sampling period were obtained in the data service platform of huiju map http map hjhj e com map 2 3 methanogenic pathway analysis based on in situ δ13c ch4 and δ13c

for stable isotopic signature of the total dissolved co2 δ13c σco2 analysis were purged with the mixing gas above n2 o2 78 22 v v for 15 min followed by acidification with 85 h3po4 w v nugent et al 2021 the fractionation factor α c calculated by the ratio between δ13c σco2 and δ13c ch4 can determine the methanogenic pathways generally hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis is the dominant pathway when α c 1 055 whereas the methylotrophic including acetoclastic methanogenesis is the dominant pathway when α c 1 055 whiticar 1999 the α c was estimated according to the following equation flury and ulseth 2019 8 α c δ 13 c σ c o 2 1000 δ 13 c c h 4 1000 in addition the isotope separation factor εc calculated by the difference between δ13c σco2 and δ13c ch4 is also widely used to determine the methanogenic pathways generally hydrogenotrophic methanogenic is the dominant pathway when εc ranges from 49 to 100 in comparison the methylotrophic methanogenic is the dominant pathway when εc ranges from 40 to 55 whiticar 1999 the εc was estimated according to the following equation miller et al 2022 whiticar 1999 9 ε c δ 13 c σ c o 2 δ 13 c c h 4 2 4 dna extraction and community composition of

conducted by the functional annotation of prokaryotic taxa faprotax louca et al 2016 in the output results of faprotax the number of sequences assigned to methanogenesis by co2 reduction with h2 and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis were averaged and regarded as hydrogenotrophic pathway the number of sequences assigned to methanogenesis using formate and methanogenesis by reduction of methyl compounds with h2 were averaged and regarded as methylotrophic methanogenesis the number of sequences assigned to acetoclastic methanogenesis and methanogenesis by disproportionation of methyl groups were averaged and regarded as acetoclastic methanogenesis the proportion of different methanogenic pathways were calculated by dividing the number of reads assigned to each pathway by the sum of the three pathways 2 5 methanogenic activity by adding various substrates apart from an empirical analysis for the in situ δ13c ch4 and δ13c σco2 characteristics we also directly incubated the sediment by adding various substrates to verify the dominant methanogenic pathway according to the δ13c ch4 signatures three sites sampled at the pelagic zone during dry season were selected to conduct the incubation tests these three sites contain the higher median and lower value within the δ13c ch4 range at yz4 62 7 yz9 88 5 and yz17 105 respectively trimethylamine tma 10 mmol l sodium acetate naac

determined by a t test relationships between dissolved co2 and ch4 concentration as well as sediment discharge and pco2 were analyzed by correlation analysis all the statistical analysis were conducted by r 3 5 2 and origin 2017 3 results 3 1 physiochemical characteristics in the water column along the river estuary continuum of the yangtze river generally the river water presented a high homogeneity in the same sampling period a shallower water depth but higher ss no2 n and nh4 n contents were present in sites near the estuary yz17 yz18 whereas no significant variation of other physiochemical characteristics was observed among sites during both wet season and dry season moreover during dry season no significant difference was observed between pelagic and littoral zone except for water depth however a significant difference was observed between wet season and dry season specifically water temperature water depth ss and no2 n in the wet season was 26 3 0 3 c 24 2 10 7 m 114 359 mg l and 10 6 10 3 μg l respectively significantly higher than that in the dry season however do doc nh4 n tp po4 3 and dissolved co2 in the wet season was 7 8 0 4 mg l 2 8 0 1 mg l 13 8 13 7 μg l

δ13c ch4 along the river estuary continuum of the yangtze river in the wet season ch4 concentration in the surface water ranged from 11 0 nmol l to 53 7 nmol l with an average value of 32 7 10 9 nmol l fourteen of the sixteen sites in yz1 yz16 were stabilized in 30 40 nmol l whereas sharply decreased to 15 8 20 1 nmol l in the estuary yz17 yz18 in the dry season no obvious ch4 distribution pattern was observed along the river estuary continuum which ranged from 15 7 nmol l to 56 8 nmol l with an average value of 30 3 10 5 nmol l in the pelagic zone and 16 2 nmol l to 74 4 nmol l with an average value of 44 1 19 9 nmol l in the littoral zone fig 2 a the diffusive ch4 flux was 27 9 11 4 μmol m2 d in wet season significantly lower than that in dry season 36 5 24 4 μmol m2 d moreover littoral zone was the hotspot for ch4 emission to the atmosphere where the emission flux reaching 43 9 28 5 μmol m2 d fig 2b nearly all the values of δ13c ch4 in the surface water were between 110 and 60 in both wet season and dry season with average values of 83 2 13 0 during wet season and 94 2 17 2 during dry season moreover the average value of δ13c ch4 in pelagic zone 96 8 16 4 was significantly lower than that in the littoral zone 91 6 18 2 fig 2c table s1 3 3 community composition of methanogens all reads were assigned to the phylum euryarchaeota and furtherly classified into 25 taxonomic groups at genus level eight of the genera average relative abundance 1 at each sampling site accounted for over 80 of all reads the most abundant genus in both pelagic and littoral zone was methanoregula with an average relative abundance of 31 6 in all samples methanothrix methanobacterium and methanocella also comprised a considerable part of the methanogenic community with an average relative abundance of 19 5 13 9 and 6 7 respectively functional annotation by faprotax showed that hydrogenotrophic methanogens dominated in pelagic zone accounting for 74 1 10 1 of the total methanogens followed by acetoclastic and methylotrophic methanogens which corresponded to 24 3 10 8 and 1 6 1 5 respectively a similar proportion was also observed in littoral zone where hydrogenotrophic acetoclastic and methylotrophic methanogens accounted for 75 8 14 6 21 9 14 0 and 2 3 3 7 respectively fig 3 3 4 the variation of ch4 concentration after adding different substrates for methanogenesis similar trends were observed in all three sites after adding different substrates specifically headspace ch4 concentration was significantly increased from near 0 3 μmol l at the beginning to 80 90 μmol l on day 30 when adding h2 co2 while ch4 concentrations were consistently lower than 2 5 μmol l during the whole incubation when adding tma bes and water however a variation was observed when adding naac although no ch4 increase along time at yz4 ch4 started to increase at day 20 and rose to 13 7 μmol l on day 30 at yz9 as for yz17 ch4 concentration consistently increased to 31 4 μmol l on day 30 fig 4 3 5 the estimation of ch4 emission since the construction of the three gorge dam tgd based on the relationship between dissolved co2 concentration and ch4 concentration in the present study we constructed the historical variation of diffusive ch4 flux from 1990 to 2021 result showed that the diffusive ch4 flux was significantly increased from 110 μmol m2 d in 1990 to 345 μmol m2 d in 1997 the time point that the tgd initially intercepted the river then largely decreased to 60 0 μmol m2 d until 2003 the time point that the tgd commenced the operation and stabilized thereafter 4 discussion 4 1 the river estuary continuum of the yangtze river is a minor source of ch4 to the atmosphere freshwater ecosystems play a critical role in global carbon budget and multiple studies have investigated ch4 emission in lakes beaulieu et al 2019 wetlands dingemans et al 2011 reservoirs johnson et al 2021 and ponds holgerson and raymond 2016 however our knowledge on ch4 emission in rivers especially in river estuary continuum is still constrained here we found that the dissolved ch4 concentrations in surface water along the river estuary continuum of the third longest river in the word was consistently oversaturated with respect to atmospheric equilibrium fig 2a making the diffusive ch4 flux reaching 27 9 11 4 μmol m2 d and 36 5 24 4 μmol m2 d in wet season and dry season respectively fig 2b compared with other large rivers ch4 emission in this study is significantly lower than that in amazonian rivers 1400 μmol m2 d sawakuchi et al 2014 and yukon river 70 1350 μmol m2 d striegl et al 2012 but within the range of yellow river estuary 24 8 301 8 μmol m2 d song and liu 2015 and one order magnitude higher than that in mississippi river 4 2 μmol m2 d crawford et al 2016 compared with different types of ecosystems the diffusive ch4 flux in this study is several orders of magnitude lower than global average emission for freshwater lakes 7 1 3 1 mmol m2 d johnson et al 2022 wetlands 10 4 1 0 mmol m2 d pasut et al 2021 and rice paddy 2 1 4 4 mmol m2 d zhang et al 2016 consequently the river estuary continuum of yangtze river is a minor source of ch4 to the atmosphere our estimates did not account for the ebullitive efflux that has been considered as a major pathway for ch4 emission in the upper reaches of the yangtze river zhang et al 2020 and some freshwater lakes wang et al 2021 however previous study has shown that ebullition most frequently occurs at sites with a shallow depth less than 6 m west et al 2016 here the average water depth was over 20 m significantly deeper than that in the upper reaches with a depth of only 0 34 2 59 m zhang et al 2020 the deeper water depth is unfavorable for ebullition formation because it s hard for the ch4 bubble pressure to overcome atmospheric and hydrostatic pressure langenegger et al 2019 thus we speculate that ch4 emission is dominated by a diffusive pathway in the river estuary continuum of the yangtze river despite the recognized significance of ch4 ebullition in shallower sites 4 2 hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis is the major pathway along the river estuary continuum of the yangtze river hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic pathways have been well described to dominate methanogenesis in lakes and wetland in most cases but our knowledge for methanogenic pathway in rivers is limited so far therefore clarifying the methanogenic pathway is important for the construction of process based models prediction of future ch4 emission strength and development of strategies for emission reduction in river ecosystems conrad 2020 here we demonstrate that hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis is the major pathway along the river estuary continuum of the yangtze river based on the δ13c ch4 signature analysis methanogen community composition and substrate amendment tests first of all due to the larger kinetic isotopic effect associated with hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis than that associated with the methylotrophic methanogenesis the stable carbon isotope signature of ch4 produced by hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis is generally lower than that produced by methylated fermentation whiticar 1999 here the highly negative values of δ13c ch4 83 2 13 0 and 94 2 17 2 during wet season and dry season respectively were exactly within the range expected for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis 110 to 60 instead of methylotrophic methanogenesis range from 60 to 50 fig 2c hornibrook and aravena 2009 whiticar 1999 additionally the calculated fractionation factor α c also showed that nearly all the values of α c were over 1 055 fig 2d a typical range of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis nugent et al 2021 it has been demonstrated that the signature of δ13c ch4 is also influenced by ch4 oxidation miller et al 2022 wherein the isotopically light ch4 is preferentially consumed resulting for a progressive enrichment of the residual ch4 in δ13c ch4 alperin et al 1988 correlation analysis showed a significant relationship between δ13c ch4 and δ13c σco2 fig 2f indicating that co2 was derived from ch4 oxidation or that ch4 was derived from hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis however the calculated isotope separation factor εc was 73 5 12 8 during wet season and 84 7 16 7 during dry season far away from the ch4 oxidation zone εc 5 30 but gathered in the hydrogenotrophic zone εc 49 100 whiticar 1999 fig 2e suggesting that ch4 was mainly produced by co2 reduction with negligible ch4 oxidation even if microbial ch4 oxidation taken into account the values of δ13c ch4 are supposed to be more negative making that hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis is still the most possible pathway in our study area secondly the obligate hydrogenotrophic methanogens like methanoregula methanobacterium and methanolinea had a considerable proportion of the total methanogen fig 3a b some metabolically versatile methanogens like methanocella and methanosarcina also jointly accounted for near 10 which have been verified to grow with h2 co2 as well as methylated compounds and even carbon monoxide co costa and leigh 2014 rother and metcalfe 2004 although there were still some obligate acetoclastic methanogens such as methanothrix and methanosarcina stams et al 2019 and methylotrophic methanogens such as methanohalobium and methanohalophilus sorokin et al 2022 present hydrogenotrophic methanogens still dominated the methanogen communities according to faprotax fig 3c d moreover δ13c ch4 in the water significantly decreased with the increase of the number of sequences assigned to hydrogenotrophic pathway fig s2 thirdly direct evidence was further obtained from the substrate amendment tests that headspace ch4 concentration by adding co2 h2 was 2 7 700 and 205 683 times higher than that by adding naac and tma at the end of incubation respectively fig 4 collectively hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis is verified to be the dominant pathway along the river estuary continuum of the yangtze river the average loi was only 2 1 1 7 in the whole river estuary continuum table s1 hardly providing sufficient methylated compound including acetate for methylotrophic and acetoclastic methanogens although increasing studies have verified ch4 could also be derived from cyanobacteria under oxic conditions bižić et al 2020 zhao et al 2022 chl a concentrations were consistently lower than 4 μg l table s1 indicating oxic methanogenesis was unlikely to occur in the oxic water column however sufficient dissolved co2 15 7 30 4 μmol l may serve substrates for methanogens making hydrogenotrophic pathway as the dominated methanogenesis in the river estuary continuum correlation analysis further showed that dissolved co2 was indeed significantly correlated with dissolved ch4 concentration figs 5 a s3 4 3 historical changes of diffusive ch4 flux in the river estuary continuum of yangtze river the correlation relationships between co2 and ch4 may consistently present along time due to the following reasons firstly although organic carbon in yangtze river mainly derived from the degradation of organic materials in soil herath et al 2022 no obvious historical changes of δ13c δ15n and the poc pn molecular ratio in particulate organic matters were observed during 1993 2010 gao et al 2012 suggesting little variation of co2 originated from soil water before and after tgd construction secondly the river estuary continuum generally lose water to the aquifers making the groundwater co2 input only contributed 0 3 of the total co2 emitted during 1956 2015 liu et al 2021 thirdly our study showed that ch4 oxidation was negligible in the sediments and water column according to the signature of δ13c ch4 and δ13c co2 fig 2e as well as ch4 oxidation tests supplementary results this may attribute to that the dissolved o2 in the bottom water was also as high as 8 9 mg l and intensely permeable to the sandy bed this characteristic makes ch4 oxidation is easily to be inhibited at low ch4 and high o2 concentrations rudd et al 1976 a previous study also showed only little ch4 oxidation in the river estuary continuum sampled in 2006 zhu et al 2010 therefore the contribution of ch4 oxidation to total co2 seems consistently low fourthly doc concentration stabilized between 80 and 160 μmol l i e 3 52 7 04 mg l in the lower reaches of yangtze river during 1997 2008 zhang et al 2014 in line with that in the present study 2 8 6 5 mg l thus it is reasonable to infer that such content of doc could hardly provide sufficient substrates for methylotrophic and acetoclastic methanogens after permeating into the sediment making hydrogenotrophy also dominated the methanogenic pathway before tgd construction based on the correlation relationships between dissolved co2 and dissolved ch4 concentration as well as a recent study that looked back on the historical variation of pco2 in the whole yangtze river ni et al 2022 we estimated the historical changes of diffusive ch4 flux in the river estuary continuum of yangtze river results showed that the diffusive ch4 flux after 2003 has decreased 82 5 relative to that during 1990 1997 fig 5b this result is similar to the study of ni et al 2020 in which dissolved ch4 flux was calculated from artificial neural networks based on nonlinear relationships among key variables including water temperature t chemical oxygen demand cod do ph no3 and nh4 here dissolved co2 was additionally taken into consideration for tracing historical variation of ch4 emission based on a process based model our study provides a new insight from a microbial perspective on ch4 cycling and it is necessary to take the methanogenic pathway into account when predicting ch4 emission from inland waters in the future recent studies have found that warming and urbanization could exacerbate greenhouse gas emission jansen et al 2022 wang et al 2022 although atmospheric temperature population and gdp have significantly increased in the past 32 years within our study area the unexpected reduction of ch4 emission indicates some other factors responsible for this variation it is noteworthy that a consistent decrease of sediment discharge was also observed during the same timescale especially after 1997 when tgd initially intercepted the river fig s4 previous studies have reported that poc which ranged from 0 5 to 2 5 of total suspended solid wu et al 2007 and significant correlated with pco2 herath et al 2022 in yangtze river were substantially sequestered by dam building li et al 2015 here we also found diffusive co2 was significantly correlated with sediment discharge in recent 25 years fig s5 indicating the construction of tgd may result in the drop of co2 because the hydrogenotrophic pathway dominates methanogenesis the decline of co2 further induced the decrease of ch4 emission in the downstream after the dam construction 5 conclusion in the present study the diffusive ch4 flux along the river estuary continuum was estimated to 27 9 11 4 μmol m2 d and 36 5 24 4 μmol m2 d in wet season and dry season respectively indicating that the river estuary continuum of yangtze river is a minor source of ch4 to the atmosphere nearly all of the δ13c ch4 values were lower than 60 with the fractionation factor α c were higher than 1 055 and the isotope separation factor εc ranged from 55 to 100 in accordance with the isotopic characteristics of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis further evidence was that the headspace ch4 concentration by adding co2 h2 was near three times to two orders of magnitude higher than that by adding naac and tma in the incubation tests moreover over 70 of methanogen communities had a capacity to reduce co2 to produce ch4 these results jointly verified hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was the dominate pathway based on the correlation relationships of dissolved co2 concentration and dissolved ch4 concentration as well as the historical data of pco2 launched by previous study the historical variation of diffusive ch4 flux was calculated and results showed that the diffusive ch4 flux has decreased 82 5 since the
