19425,in this work we examine the factors predicting the perception of three distinct risks namely algae growth chemical pollution and changes to ecosystems to the water environment of each european union member state we utilize a novel dataset that combines a europe wide eurobarometer poll on water related issues and a database of water quality indicators water stressors and impacts compiled for the european environment agency eea under the water information system for europe wise we utilize a three level logistic regression model with the 2nd and 3rd levels being the region and the country in which the respondent lives we find that perceived risks generally reflect the actual state of the environment at both the regional and national level with the national level being stronger perceived risks are also related to socio demographics information and knowledge pro environmental activity and consumer practices the influence of unobserved factors captured in the model by random effects was large at the national level reflecting differences in cultural and institutional structures results support higher levels of water policy devolution and more focused and targeted policy communication graphical abstract image keywords algae growth changes in water ecosystems chemical pollution multilevel analysis river basin districts water risk perceptions 1 introduction the water framework directive wfd launched in 2000 is the european union s eu response to the rising challenges faced by water ecosystems in europe the wfd established a policy framework for achieving good ecological status ges and good chemical status in all surface and groundwater by 2015 this policy framework is highly decentralized but tightly managed and centrally coordinated at the core of this framework lies a water management system by river basin the hydrological unit of the system because of ecological variability across europe setting an absolute standard for biological quality would be very unlikely to succeed thus the uniform ges target is represented by a biological community which would be expected in conditions of minimal anthropogenic impact this target is determined locally for each river basin however to ensure comparability among member states ms a set of procedures for identifying ges for each water body and for establishing chemical or hydromorphological standards to achieve the targets are agreed and set out centrally the river basin management plan details for each river basin how the objectives are set and how they will be reached within a given timescale river basin management plans were based on very extensive and intense public consultation for two reasons first plans should facilitate the balance of interests of various groups by a process that is open especially to those who will be affected second the higher the public involvement and transparency the higher the expected enforceability of the plans in this context public risk perceptions can fundamentally compel or constrain political economic and social action to address particular risks leiserowitz 2006 higher levels of perceived environmental risk have been shown to induce higher levels of motivation to adapt osberghaus et al 2010 and thus can mobilize the public towards the adoption of appropriate measures therefore knowledge about the factors that affect risk perception will contribute to policy design and support higher levels of public involvement and enforceability the aim of this work is to examine the factors influencing public risk perceptions regarding water quality in the european union we utilize a large public survey administered in 2012 in all mss of the eu by the european commission s public opinion services in the framework of the flash eurobarometer series and focusing exclusively on water issues in the same year 2012 the european environment agency put together data from all river basin management plans to assemble a baseline monitoring database of water environmental and chemical indicators and of major impacts and stressors for all water bodies in europe thus the combined dataset relates a large and geographically dispersed public opinion survey to a water monitoring database the present research focuses on three perceived threats to the water environment namely algae growth chemical pollution and ecosystem changes we test how perceptions of these threats to the water environment relate to the actual water status and current threats it faces we also examine whether water status at the regional level is related to risk perceptions at the national level finally we explore whether risk perceptions are associated with factors such as pro environmental behaviour education and gender results indicate that threats are perceived in different ways by various citizens among the factors that segregate the public with respect to perceived threats to the water environment are various socio demographic characteristics behaviour consumer and environmental practice and the conditions of the water environment in the region and the country in which they reside 2 data theoretical underpinnings and methods 2 1 eurobarometer eu citizens and perceived threats individual perceptions of threats to the water environment were extracted from flash eurobarometer 344 attitudes of europeans towards water related issues a european poll survey conducted in 2012 european commission 2012 1 1 a similar but not identical eurobarometer survey on water was carried out in 2009 flash eurobarometer 261 opinion and attitude changes that are observed between the 2009 and 2012 surveys may be due to improvements in the water environment for which however there is no physical evidence this is due to the fact that data on the status of the water bodies were first collected and assimilated to a database in 2012 about 25 000 european citizens located in almost all eu territories responded to a questionnaire addressing issues related to water as such this opinion poll constitutes a large and representative sample that is well designed and executed the technical specifications of the poll including sample sizes sampling and interview methods questionnaires sampling weights and others are annexed to its official report european commission 2012 in addition as this opinion poll was dedicated to water related issues it did not have the documented disadvantages of opinion polls which are usually simple and holistic to derive the individual s perception of threat we used the data collected for question 5 which asked the respondents about their perceived major threats to the water environment the question was as follows i am going to read out a list of threats can you please tell me which you believe are the main threats to the water environment in name of the country the possible pre coded answers included algae growth chemical pollution water shortage floods change to water ecosystems dams canals and other physical changes climate change other for the respondent to state one that is not included in the pre coded answers you do not care about this issue don t know or not answer in this work we examine only the threats of algae growth chemical pollution and change to water ecosystems because these could be matched by relevant objective measurements found in the water information system for europe wise database as is explained below the survey coded the response to each one of the above mentioned threats as a dummy variable 1 if the threat is perceived as such and mentioned by the respondent and 0 if it was not mentioned risk perceptions are expressed through subjective judgments that people make when they depict and assess the likelihood of negative occurrences due to hazardous activities and technologies understanding risk perception has been supported by contributions in psychology sociology economics anthropology geography and political science slovic 2016 tversky and kahneman 1979 it is out of the scope of this work to review theoretical models developed to explain the way in which people perceive threats and make decisions about risks in a recent review of models used in the relevant literature paek and hove 2017 record the psychometric paradigm the risk perception model the mental noise model the negative dominance model the trust determination model and the social amplification of risk framework all approaches indicate that risk is inherently multidimensional with individual judgments apparently influenced by many personal and environmental characteristics the international academic literature through the years has distilled several factors that shape the public s perception of ecological risk these factors form a set of widely accepted statements and include environmentalism practices knowledge and information experience and culture one may consider controlling for such socio demographic factors when analysing risk perception the eurobarometer survey recorded the respondents place of residence and specific characteristics which included demographics age gender household size human capital and employment characteristics education employment status pro environmental behaviour stated level of knowledge about water related issues and consumption practices especially as concerns consumption of bottled or tap water dunlap and scarce 1991 have long argued that environmental cognitions are the bedrock of support for environmentally friendly or hostile behaviors and are the basis of environmental risk perceptions as such risk perceptions are found to be embedded in behaviour as a by product of environmental beliefs o connor et al 1999 the general notion of environmentalism in the public opinion literature has been used interchangeably with the terms attitudes beliefs and paradigms to indicate general environmental cognitive orientations environmentalism is usually captured by actual or intended environmental behaviours in opinion polls individuals may report intentions to engage or actual engagement in environmentally or conservation friendly activities to measure environmentalism many researchers use the new ecological paradigm nep of dunlap et al 2000 which ranks respondents attitudes on 15 items slimak and dietz 2006 found that environmentalism measured by the nep can explain from 19 to 46 of the variance in the ecological risk rankings the nep score was used by carlton and jacobson 2013 in a study of coastal risk environmental perceptions in florida and proved to be the strongest predictor of physical environment risk perception other researchers capture environmentalism through pro environmental behaviour and relate it to ecological risk perceptions using the eurobarometer survey we were not able to re construct a nep score because the respondent s engagement with environmental and conservation friendly activities was captured by slightly different items these items address directly the respondent s behaviour towards water use or water resources conservation in general more specifically the eurobarometer survey recorded the respondents everyday water conservation practices such as not leaving taps running taking shower instead of bath installing water saving appliances etc harvesting rainwater and avoiding the use of pesticides and fertilizers in the garden the respondents broader pro environmental behaviour regarding their adoption of conservation activities such as the preference for organic farm products and recycling of specific waste like oil waste unused pharmaceuticals unused household chemicals paints solvents and batteries were also recorded in the survey the respondents engagement with these items allowed us to build a basic psychographic profile of their environmentalism for each of the items the respondent was assigned one point if they declared engagement and zero otherwise thus a respondent could have a total score ranging from a maximum of seven if they were engaged in all activities down to zero if she was engaged to none of the activities we expect higher environmentalism to be associated with higher risk perceptions about the water environment consumption practices and behaviour is a very important social construct that in relation to environmental beliefs predict risk attitudes scientists agree that the most acute environmental issues such as resource depletion water pollution and climate change can eventually be assigned to inherent consumption practices embedded into everyday economic behaviour bolderdijk and steg 2015 regarding water the exclusive consumption of bottled water serves as an indicator of perceived risk in consuming tap water de frança doria 2010 while the exclusive consumption of tap water may indicate a pro environmental attitude however both these practices are likely to also be influenced by income constraints and consumption opportunities to some degree in the eurobarometer survey consumption practices were recorded by asking whether the respondent consumes exclusively bottled or tap water or both knowledge can be thought as a surrogate for salience with people who perceive an issue to be important to become more informed about the issue so perceived risk may pre occupy knowledge acquisition griffin et al 2004 on the contrary o connor et al 1999 conclude that prior knowledge is the main factor fostering behavioural intentions to act on environmental issues and not salience indeed steel et al 1990 report that in a split sample of canadian and american respondents self rated prior knowledge of pollution sources to water in the great lakes increased risk perceptions to canadian participants but decreased perceived risk to americans similarly mcdaniels et al 1997 found significant differences in risk perceptions between lay people and experts in the eurobarometer survey the level of knowledge and information was based on each respondent s personal judgment of the level of information related to problems facing groundwater lakes rivers and coastal waters in their country and their perception of the state of the water environment in the place they live we expect self rated knowledge and informedness regarding pressures on the water environment to be positively related to risk perceptions socio demographics such as gender age education occupation or income ethnicity and religion are related to perceived environmental risks either positively or negatively gender is so closely linked to risk perception that the white male effect is now a stylized fact kahan et al 2007 liobikienė and juknys 2016 this has been established as early as 1990 when steel et al reported women perceived threats to the water environment to be of significantly higher risk than was perceived by men while other studies bring into question the role of gender in determining risk perception e g slimak and dietz 2006 the weight of existing evidence leads us to predict that female respondents will perceive a greater risk to the water environment than male respondents depending on the threat under consideration age appears to have several sometimes contradictory effects for example slimak and dietz 2006 found a strong positive correlation between the respondents age and factors that captured the ecological chemical and biological scales of risk flint et al 2017 found a significant positive linear relationship between age and levels of concern across all four water risks under consideration in their study while toma and mathijs 2007 found a negative relationship between age and willingness to adopt water saving and water quality improving schemes in romania other researchers have found weak relations between age and risk perception on water pollution liobikienė and juknys 2016 when the impact of climate change on water is considered the influence of age on risk perceptions even more ambiguous frondel et al 2017 in almost all studies examining environmental risk perceptions education emerges as a major socio demographic determinant although the effect is not always the same respondents possessing higher levels of education tend to show higher levels of concern for water quality issues steel et al 1990 and increased willingness to adopt water improving schemes toma and mathijs 2007 however flint et al 2017 found that the respondents education was unrelated to their level of concern about water shortages and negatively correlated with water quality and flooding risks slimak and dietz 2006 report that a higher level of education was associated with lower concern of the respondent for ecological and biological risks while there was no significant relation with chemical risk the eurobarometer survey studied here does not record the respondent s education level but the age at which education was completed is recorded in general this is an adequate approximation of the respondent s education level which we postulate to be positively associated with risk perception table 1 presents the names definitions and descriptive statistics of the survey variables capturing perceived threats to the water environment socio demographic environmentalism information and knowledge and practice characteristics it also summarizes the effects of the variables on perceived threat as these were recorded in the relevant literature review above all the aforementioned factors potentially shape an individual s perceived risk in turn the level of perceived risk is a major determinant of mitigation and adaptation behaviour that is revealed through an individual s actions de frança doria 2010 such actions may include the adoption of new technologies or new consumption practices the purchase of insurances or the willingness of individuals to participate in public consultation activities to guide certain environmental outcomes furthermore an analysis of the factors related to perceived risk may allow policy makers at the local level to attempt to modify perceived risks or better target groups of citizens with high perceived risk to address their high concerns about environmental issues finally each respondent s contribution to the sample is weighted with pre specified weights when we present percentages or proportions at european or country level we weight the calculations with the weights provided by eurobarometer for the eu 27 mss for data analysis purposes and inference especially from complex regression structures we do not weight the data 2 2 weighting survey data is an extremely complicated and difficult issue especially when complex data structures e g hierarchical models are contemplated the interested reader can consult gelman 2007 with the associated discussion comments and rejoiner the price to pay for using the eurobarometer survey comes in the form of several limitations first perceived water environment threats are recorded as a yes no response and their perceived severity is not evaluated for example on a likert scale second pro environmental attitudes and in general environmentalism cannot be deduced with a formal model such as the nep this denies from the present survey comparability with other surveys that are based on the nep third the survey provides behavioural characteristics related to water consumption but it does not report the respondents use of water bodies for recreation sports or environmental activities e g birdwatching nature photography etc or as an element of their everyday landscape 2 2 geospatial data the flash eurobarometer 344 survey european commission 2012 recorded the place of residence in terms of the european hierarchy of spatial administrative units called nuts from the french nomenclature des unités territoriales statistiques for most countries this corresponds to the nuts2 spatial level which is the major administrative unit and the basic unit for the application of eu s policies this does not include germany and the uk which report at the nuts1 level the larger agglomerate of nuts2 regions or the small countries luxemburg cyprus malta estonia lithuania and latvia which report at the country level the responses concerning perceived threats to the water environment vary greatly among citizens living in the same country and among citizens living in different countries fig 1 shows the boxplots for the three risks in the 27 eu countries chemical pollution is unanimously perceived as the greatest threat to the water environment among eu citizens with very small differences among countries ranging from a minimum of 70 for finland to a maximum of 93 for the czech republic responses regarding algae growth and changes to ecosystems were more variable among countries for algae growth the weighted country proportion was as low as 10 for bulgaria and as high as 70 for respondents in france changes to ecosystems showed almost the same variation as algae growth with a low of 16 found for respondents in lithuania and a high of 73 for respondents in portugal when the same proportions are calculated at a regional scale intranational variations are similarly high for example as concerns the perceived threat of algae growth french respondents rank the top weighted country with an average of 70 however there are french nuts2 regions for which the percentage is considerably lower e g close to 54 in the region of haute normandie nuts2 code of fr23 in our analysis we assume that such country and regional differences are due to differences in the respondents characteristics as well as differences of the state of the environment within which the respondents work and live this can be used as a contextual or experiential variable same for all respondents living in the same region or same for all respondents living in the same country information on the various aspects of the water environment is not available at the same spatial level at which eurobarometer data are collected for this reason we utilize another set of spatially related data provided by the eu s water information system for europe wise wise records the percentage of area or the percentage of the length of water bodies that are classified in the five categories of ecological status for each rbd and for each river basin sub district a spatial unit that is smaller than the rbd the five categories are high good moderate poor and bad reflecting the abundance of aquatic flora and fauna the availability of nutrients aspects of salinity temperature pollution by chemical pollutants and alterations to morphological features such as water quantity flow and depth and the structure of the river beds wise also records at the rbd level only the chemical status of water bodies on a good fail dummy category and the proportion of water bodies affected by different impacts e g acidification altered habitats contaminated sediments contaminated water by priority substances nutrient and organic enrichment and the proportion of water bodies under various pressures such as diffuse and point source pollution water abstraction and morphological alterations we utilized gis overlay and intersection methodology to combine the river basin district and sub district layers and nuts layers to assign to each nuts region the characteristics of the water bodies enclosed by the nuts boundaries as such we could produce variables measuring the percentage of the length of water bodies a under each ecological status b under good fail chemical status and c under other impacts or various pressures 3 3 annex a of this work provides details and examples of the gis methodology used to upgrade rbds to nuts and an exposition to assumptions that had to be made at the administrative nuts level however not all rbds had classified all water bodies within their boundaries the first indicator ecological status was used as a proxy of a respondent s experience of the regional and national water ecosystem and as an explanatory variable to the ecosystem changes threat the percentage of the length of water bodies under good chemical condition is used as an explanatory variable to the chemical pollution threat from the various impacts and pressures recorded in wise we selected the percentage of the length of water bodies that are under pressure from diffused pollution as an explanatory variable to the algae growth threat in some of the rbds less than half of the water bodies had been classified according to their ecological or chemical status thus these rbds were excluded from the analysis because their environmental indicators could not be considered representative of the whole rbd the variability of the status of water bodies at the nuts level based on the above methodology was considerable indicatively map 1 shows the percentage of the length of water bodies whose ecological status has been classified as poor or bad upscaled at the nuts levels used by the eurobarometer it is worth noting that the largest part of poland and of italy are missing because almost all polish and most italian rbds had classified less than half of their water bodies to ecological status classes table 2 shows the proportions for various environmental indicators at the regional nuts or national level 2 3 a three level logistic regression model in this section we detail how we model the way in which respondents recognize each of the three threats to the water ecosystems considered the model is formulated using a latent variable framework suppose that underlying the binary response y i j k that a respondent i in region j of country k perceives algae growth chemical pollution or changes to ecosystems to be a threat or not is a continuous latent variable y i j k that generates the observed binary responses by the threshold model 1 y ijk 1 i f y ijk 0 respondent perceives this is a threat 0 i f y ijk 0 r e s p o n d e n t d o e s n o t p e r c e i v e t h i s i s a t h r e a t this latent response is 2 y i j k π 0 j k β i x ijk ε i j k where x ijk is a vector of respondent specific observable characteristics β i is a vector of coefficients to be estimated and π 0 j k is an intercept that is allowed to vary among regions j and countries k this intercept can be estimated using region specific characteristics as 3 π 0 j k π 00 k β j x jk ζ j k 2 where x jk is a vector of region specific characteristics i e same across all respondents within the region β j is a vector of coefficients to be estimated π 00 k is an intercept that is allowed to vary among countries k and ζ j k 2 is for this equation an error term called a random intercept that varies over regions level 2 and is distributed normally with mean 0 and variance ψ 2 as ζ j k 2 n 0 ψ 2 the intercept π 00 k can be estimated using country specific characteristics as 4 π 00 k π 000 β k x k ζ k 3 where x k is a vector of country specific characteristics i e same across all respondents within the country β k is a vector of coefficients to be estimated π 000 is an intercept and ζ k 3 is in this equation an error term called a random intercept that varies across countries level 3 and is distributed normally with mean 0 and variance ψ 3 as ζ k 3 n 0 ψ 3 if we substitute equation 4 into equation 3 and then the resultant expression into equation 2 we get y i j k π 000 β i x ijk β j x jk β k x k ζ j k 2 ζ k 3 ε i j k where ε i j k ζ k 3 ζ j k 2 x ijk follows a standard logistic distribution with variance π 2 3 thus the logit is formulated as 5 l o g i t p y ijk 1 x ijk ζ j k 2 ζ k 3 π 000 ζ j k 2 ζ k 3 β i x ijk β j x jk β k x k the term π 000 is referred to as the overall intercept and is interpreted as the log odds that the respondent perceives the threat when all x covariates and ζ j k 2 ζ k 3 are zero equation 5 is the expression of the typical three level random intercept logistic regression the β vector contains coefficients that capture simple effects of the respondent region and country predictors for continuous predictors such as age or environmentalism this is the effect of a 1 unit change on x from its grand centered value grand centering means that from each observation of a continuous variable we subtract its sample mean for dummy predictors this is the difference between the two levels of the dummy variable the ζ j k 2 and ζ k 3 random effects can be predicted and their interpretation is rather simple for two respondents who have identical observable characteristics and live in different regions of the same country the difference in their predicted ζ j k 2 will be their difference in the log odds that they perceive the threat and can be interpreted as the pure regional effect for two respondents who live in different countries and by definition in different regions and have identical observable characteristics the difference in the predicted sum ζ j k 2 ζ k 3 will be their difference in the log odds that they perceive the threat and can be interpreted as the combined locational region and country effect the three level random intercept logistic regression can be estimated using various software and or routines and various algorithms in this work we estimate the model of equation 5 above by using gllamm for the algae growth chemical pollution and change to ecosystems threats separately and produce predictions of the random intercepts at the second and third levels by using gllapred which are both stata programs rabe hesketh et al 2012 and gllamm s program site at http www gllamm org 3 results the model presented in equation 5 is estimated for each one of the three threats that we examine in this work by estimating first a null model i e a model without covariates then a model containing only first level covariates and then a full model containing covariates in all levels these models are nested and thus they can be compared using likelihood ratio tests table 3 presents the final models that by likelihood ratio tests are superior to a simple logistic regression which does not take account of the multilevel structure of the data to a null model i e a model without covariates and to a model without higher level covariates before deriving the final model we examined a series of alternative formulations containing either some meaningful transformations of the variables such as the quadratic interactions among covariates factorials cross interactions among covariates at different levels and random slope models even when there was some slight improvement in the model s statistical properties this was not enough to weight against the simplicity and interpretability of the presented models the results reported in table 3 are based on a sample that excludes all countries that do not have two or more regions almost 5000 observations so that the second regional and third national levels do not coincide as well as all regions which had not classified more than 50 of the length of their water bodies in 2012 around 2000 observations mainly in poland and italy and all regions which following the aforementioned truncation had less than 20 remaining respondents a statistical rule of thumb threshold to include a second level unit in the analysis however analysis in which all models are re fitted with varied samples show that the signs and significance of the coefficients are robust 4 4 results from alternative model formulations and of robustness tests with samples of varying sizes are available from the authors upon request 3 1 fixed effects our baseline respondent is female gender 0 has an age of 50 the centered age variable is 0 lives in small town rural 0 and large town 0 has finished education before the age of 14 education1 0 education2 0 is currently unemployed self employed 0 employee 0 retired 0 has adopted an average of 3 6 pro environmental activities the centered environment variable is 0 she is not very well or well informed about water issues inform 0 and she does not exclusively drink tap water tap water 0 in the region where the respondent lives and for the algae growth threat we assume that diffused source pollution diffused reg affects 0 of the length of water bodies for the chemical pollution threat we assume that 0 of the length of water bodies have good chemical status good chem reg for the ecosystem changes threat we assume that 0 of the length of water bodies are classified to a high and good status high good reg similarly for the country where the average respondent lives the corresponding figures are 0 for diffused nat 0 for good chem nat and 0 for high good nat we should be aware that the question recording perceived threats asks whether the respondent perceives a certain threat as such for the whole country and not for the region where she lives however a respondent s perception may be shaped by two elements the status of the environment at her immediate surrounding that comes from experience and from the status of the environment in the whole country that may come from experience through travelling or from information presented in the media the odds of perceiving algae growth as a threat to the country s water environment increase as the proportion of water bodies in the region experiencing diffused source pollution increases for this baseline respondent and assuming zero random effects the log odds of equation 5 for perceiving algae growth as a threat to the water environment is the constant 1 400 as reported in table 3 at the coefficients column for the algae growth threat by exponentiating this figure we find the odds that this respondent perceives algae growth as a threat to be e 1 400 0 247 in probabilistic terms the probability that this baseline respondent perceives algae growth as a threat is e 1 400 1 e 1 400 0 198 o r 19 8 and thus the probability that she does not perceive algae growth as a threat is 1 0 198 0 802 o r 80 2 now assume that this same respondent had finished education after the age of 22 instead of the age under 14 theoretically she would have had attained the higher educational level in the sample and the only change in the above estimations would come from the fact that the respondent has a value of one for the variable education2 thus the log odds change by the coefficient of this variable and are 1 400 0 242 1 158 with corresponding odds at e 1 158 0 314 and the probability that the respondent perceives algae growth as a threat calculated at e 1 158 1 e 1 158 0 239 o r 23 9 the odds ratios reported in table 3 show how the odds of perceiving algae growth as a threat increase odds ratio higher than 1 or decrease odds ratio less than 1 between the two values of a dummy variable or by increasing a continuous variable by one unit similarly we can interpret the figures reported for the threats of chemical pollution and ecosystem changes of table 3 the odds of perceiving chemical pollution as a threat to the country s water environment is negatively related to the proportion of the country s water bodies classified as having good chemical status there was no significant relationship with the corresponding regional proportion fig 2 shows the patterns between the individual differences that exert significant effects on the probability to perceive chemical pollution as a major threat to the water environment with the physical risk data measured by the percentage of the length of national water bodies classified as having good chemical status perceived threat and the percentage of good chemical status are negatively related a gender gap of almost 5 consistent with literature findings is maintained irrespective of the status of the physical environment perceived threat is positively related to education and negatively related to the level of information about water issues possessed by respondents the proportion of water bodies classified as high or good in the region is positively associated with the odds that ecosystem changes is perceived as a threat for the country s water environment at the same time the proportion of water bodies classified as high or good in the country is negatively associated with the odds that ecosystem changes is perceived as a threat 5 5 the correlation coefficient between the two variables measuring the proportion of water bodies classified as having high and good status at the regional and national levels is moderate at around 0 7 depending on the compositions of the sample considering the sign of the correlation coefficient between the two variables and the size of the standard errors of the coefficients the opposite signs of the coefficients cannot be attributed to collinearity this may indicate reverse causality or selection but due to the cross section sample we are not able to test for this pro environmental attitudes and activities are strongly related to the perception of all risks as expected by literature information is related only to the perception of the risk due to chemical pollution informed citizens have lower odds to perceive chemical pollution as a threat to the water environment also those respondents who drink exclusively tap water have lower odds of considering chemical pollution to be a threat to the water environment citizens in urban areas have higher odds to perceive chemical pollution as a major threat while residents of rural areas have lower odds to perceive ecosystem changes as a threat education is positively and substantially related to the odds of perceiving all the three threats as concerns the effects of gender we record a male effect where men are less likely to perceive chemical pollution and ecosystem changes as threats than women the respondents age is positively related to the odds of perceiving algae growth as a threat and negatively related to the odds of perceiving chemical pollution and ecosystem changes as threats 3 2 empirical bayes predictions of random effects empirical bayes predictions of random effects ζ j k 2 ζ k 3 are derived using the gllapred routine in stata rabe hesketh et al 2012 random effects should be interpreted as error terms that capture the unobserved heterogeneity of a spatial level in our work these terms are used to capture cultural and institutional heterogeneity resulting from the country and region membership of an observation interpret the third level random effects as the odds of perceiving a threat between two respondents who live in a different country but have exactly the same characteristics live in areas with the same physical characteristics of the water environment and in a typical region of their country predicted random effects ζ j k 2 ζ k 3 average to zero for a typical region or a typical country respectively caterpillars of the predicted country random effects for algae growth chemical pollution and ecosystem changes are shown in figs 3 5 the figures present the predicted random effects for 20 countries out of the 27 of the eurobarometer survey that remained in the analysis random effects for algae growth range from 1 33 for bulgaria to 1 33 for france for example the estimate for france is interpreted as the odds of the baseline respondent who lives in a typical region in france ζ j k 2 0 has almost double the odds of recognizing algae growth as a threat to her national water environment from a respondent with the same characteristics living in a typical region ζ j k 2 0 of a typical country ζ k 3 0 such as the netherlands denmark or austria on the contrary the bulgarian baseline respondent has almost half the odds of recognizing algae growth as a threat from a respondent with the same characteristics but living in the netherlands or denmark i e countries with zero random effect eight countries have 3rd level random predictions at around 0 6 odds of 1 8 another group of eight countries have predictions which do not differ significantly from 0 and three countries have negative random country prediction i e odds of less than one for chemical pollution random 3rd level effects have significantly lower range than the corresponding 3rd level random effects for algae growth and ecosystem changes as expected the group of countries which have very high or very low random effects in each threat is different for example greece scores very low for algae growth and very high for chemical pollution while random effects for finland are exactly the opposite france has high and bulgaria low random effects for all three threats the second level regional random effects ζ j k 2 also tell an interesting story for the chemical pollution threat the regional random effects deviate around zero and are not statistically significant for algae growth they range from 0 35 to 0 30 and have a statistically significant but quantitatively moderate to low impact in comparison to the respective third level national random effects for ecosystem changes the regional random effects range from 0 35 to 0 23 the variance among regional random effects reveals that there is a regional disparity element within national risk perception for algae growth and ecosystem changes but not for chemical pollution 4 conclusions and policy implications in this work we attempted to examine whether public perceived risks regarding the state of the water environment at the national level are associated with the actual state of the water environment as measured by a series of environmental indicators at the regional and national levels the results are consistent with the hypothesis that the state of the national and regional environment affects public perceptions of risks to the water environment perceived risk due to chemical pollution and due to ecosystem changes is closely related to the actual state of the national environment the better the state of the environment the lower the perceived risk the state of the regional environment i e the environment considered to have immediate interaction with the respondent is associated with the perception of risk due to algae growth with worse environmental indicators reflected by higher perceived risk however the ecological status of the regional environment is associated with perceived risk due to ecosystem changes in the opposite direction the larger the proportion of water courses that have been classified as high or good the higher the probability that ecosystem changes is perceived as a threat this result is very important and may be due either to reverse causality or to selection and needs further elaboration reverse causality may exist if citizens who think that ecosystem changes is a real threat have already acted to secure a high or good water environment these citizens are afraid of losing an achievement in their water environment for which they have invested efforts and resources selection may exist if citizens who consider ecosystem changes as a threat to the water environment have chosen to live in places that have high or good water environment these citizens may be afraid to lose a high water environment status for which they have implicitly paid through probably higher land market prices or higher rents as concerns other factors related to risk perception the results support previous research perceived risk is positively related to pro environmental activities the level of education and the gender the analysis also reaffirmed that age can have both positive and negative effects on risk perception this may hide a generational issue as concerns water environment threats with older generations being more sensitive to algae growth and younger generations to chemical pollution and changes to ecosystems the level of the respondent s information about water issues appears to reduce the probability of perceiving chemical pollution as a threat living in a rural environment is negatively related to the probability that chemical pollution and changes to ecosystems are recognized as threats results show that water related risk perceptions are context specific and are related to personal characteristics this has two implications for water policy design and delivery first it supports the eu s decision to plan and manage water resources at a low spatial level i e at the river basin district and to allow regional and national authorities to draw their own measures without prescribing recipes thus accommodating the diversity of the european union and the sensitivity of european citizens to their regional and national contexts second it shows that citizens can recognize and respond to water related risks in the 2012 eurobarometer survey 73 of respondents stated that the eu should propose additional measures for water problems to be addressed our results substantiate the need for a proper communication of policy reforms to european public which should be underpinned by a more credible evaluation of water environment risks results show that this communication can be more effective if information about specific water environment issues and policies target specific segments of the population campaigns aiming to raise awareness or to increase public participation or the proportion of volunteers for water conservation activities should be targeted segments can be created by clustering the population according to their age education and engagement to environmental activities and the status of the water environment in their region acknowledgment the authors

19425,in this work we examine the factors predicting the perception of three distinct risks namely algae growth chemical pollution and changes to ecosystems to the water environment of each european union member state we utilize a novel dataset that combines a europe wide eurobarometer poll on water related issues and a database of water quality indicators water stressors and impacts compiled for the european environment agency eea under the water information system for europe wise we utilize a three level logistic regression model with the 2nd and 3rd levels being the region and the country in which the respondent lives we find that perceived risks generally reflect the actual state of the environment at both the regional and national level with the national level being stronger perceived risks are also related to socio demographics information and knowledge pro environmental activity and consumer practices the influence of unobserved factors captured in the model by random effects was large at the national level reflecting differences in cultural and institutional structures results support higher levels of water policy devolution and more focused and targeted policy communication graphical abstract image keywords algae growth changes in water ecosystems chemical pollution multilevel analysis river basin districts water risk perceptions 1 introduction the water framework directive wfd launched in 2000 is the european union s eu response to the rising challenges faced by water ecosystems in europe the wfd established a policy framework for achieving good ecological status ges and good chemical status in all surface and groundwater by 2015 this policy framework is highly decentralized but tightly managed and centrally coordinated at the core of this framework lies a water management system by river basin the hydrological unit of the system because of ecological variability across europe setting an absolute standard for biological quality would be very unlikely to succeed thus the uniform ges target is represented by a biological community which would be expected in conditions of minimal anthropogenic impact this target is determined locally for each river basin however to ensure comparability among member states ms a set of procedures for identifying ges for each water body and for establishing chemical or hydromorphological standards to achieve the targets are agreed and set out centrally the river basin management plan details for each river basin how the objectives are set and how they will be reached within a given timescale river basin management plans were based on very extensive and intense public consultation for two reasons first plans should facilitate the balance of interests of various groups by a process that is open especially to those who will be affected second the higher the public involvement and transparency the higher the expected enforceability of the plans in this context public risk perceptions can fundamentally compel or constrain political economic and social action to address particular risks leiserowitz 2006 higher levels of perceived environmental risk have been shown to induce higher levels of motivation to adapt osberghaus et al 2010 and thus can mobilize the public towards the adoption of appropriate measures therefore knowledge about the factors that affect risk perception will contribute to policy design and support higher levels of public involvement and enforceability the aim of this work is to examine the factors influencing public risk perceptions regarding water quality in the european union we utilize a large public survey administered in 2012 in all mss of the eu by the european commission s public opinion services in the framework of the flash eurobarometer series and focusing exclusively on water issues in the same year 2012 the european environment agency put together data from all river basin management plans to assemble a baseline monitoring database of water environmental and chemical indicators and of major impacts and stressors for all water bodies in europe thus the combined dataset relates a large and geographically dispersed public opinion survey to a water monitoring database the present research focuses on three perceived threats to the water environment namely algae growth chemical pollution and ecosystem changes we test how perceptions of these threats to the water environment relate to the actual water status and current threats it faces we also examine whether water status at the regional level is related to risk perceptions at the national level finally we explore whether risk perceptions are associated with factors such as pro environmental behaviour education and gender results indicate that threats are perceived in different ways by various citizens among the factors that segregate the public with respect to perceived threats to the water environment are various socio demographic characteristics behaviour consumer and environmental practice and the conditions of the water environment in the region and the country in which they reside 2 data theoretical underpinnings and methods 2 1 eurobarometer eu citizens and perceived threats individual perceptions of threats to the water environment were extracted from flash eurobarometer 344 attitudes of europeans towards water related issues a european poll survey conducted in 2012 european commission 2012 1 1 a similar but not identical eurobarometer survey on water was carried out in 2009 flash eurobarometer 261 opinion and attitude changes that are observed between the 2009 and 2012 surveys may be due to improvements in the water environment for which however there is no physical evidence this is due to the fact that data on the status of the water bodies were first collected and assimilated to a database in 2012 about 25 000 european citizens located in almost all eu territories responded to a questionnaire addressing issues related to water as such this opinion poll constitutes a large and representative sample that is well designed and executed the technical specifications of the poll including sample sizes sampling and interview methods questionnaires sampling weights and others are annexed to its official report european commission 2012 in addition as this opinion poll was dedicated to water related issues it did not have the documented disadvantages of opinion polls which are usually simple and holistic to derive the individual s perception of threat we used the data collected for question 5 which asked the respondents about their perceived major threats to the water environment the question was as follows i am going to read out a list of threats can you please tell me which you believe are the main threats to the water environment in name of the country the possible pre coded answers included algae growth chemical pollution water shortage floods change to water ecosystems dams canals and other physical changes climate change other for the respondent to state one that is not included in the pre coded answers you do not care about this issue don t know or not answer in this work we examine only the threats of algae growth chemical pollution and change to water ecosystems because these could be matched by relevant objective measurements found in the water information system for europe wise database as is explained below the survey coded the response to each one of the above mentioned threats as a dummy variable 1 if the threat is perceived as such and mentioned by the respondent and 0 if it was not mentioned risk perceptions are expressed through subjective judgments that people make when they depict and assess the likelihood of negative occurrences due to hazardous activities and technologies understanding risk perception has been supported by contributions in psychology sociology economics anthropology geography and political science slovic 2016 tversky and kahneman 1979 it is out of the scope of this work to review theoretical models developed to explain the way in which people perceive threats and make decisions about risks in a recent review of models used in the relevant literature paek and hove 2017 record the psychometric paradigm the risk perception model the mental noise model the negative dominance model the trust determination model and the social amplification of risk framework all approaches indicate that risk is inherently multidimensional with individual judgments apparently influenced by many personal and environmental characteristics the international academic literature through the years has distilled several factors that shape the public s perception of ecological risk these factors form a set of widely accepted statements and include environmentalism practices knowledge and information experience and culture one may consider controlling for such socio demographic factors when analysing risk perception the eurobarometer survey recorded the respondents place of residence and specific characteristics which included demographics age gender household size human capital and employment characteristics education employment status pro environmental behaviour stated level of knowledge about water related issues and consumption practices especially as concerns consumption of bottled or tap water dunlap and scarce 1991 have long argued that environmental cognitions are the bedrock of support for environmentally friendly or hostile behaviors and are the basis of environmental risk perceptions as such risk perceptions are found to be embedded in behaviour as a by product of environmental beliefs o connor et al 1999 the general notion of environmentalism in the public opinion literature has been used interchangeably with the terms attitudes beliefs and paradigms to indicate general environmental cognitive orientations environmentalism is usually captured by actual or intended environmental behaviours in opinion polls individuals may report intentions to engage or actual engagement in environmentally or conservation friendly activities to measure environmentalism many researchers use the new ecological paradigm nep of dunlap et al 2000 which ranks respondents attitudes on 15 items slimak and dietz 2006 found that environmentalism measured by the nep can explain from 19 to 46 of the variance in the ecological risk rankings the nep score was used by carlton and jacobson 2013 in a study of coastal risk environmental perceptions in florida and proved to be the strongest predictor of physical environment risk perception other researchers capture environmentalism through pro environmental behaviour and relate it to ecological risk perceptions using the eurobarometer survey we were not able to re construct a nep score because the respondent s engagement with environmental and conservation friendly activities was captured by slightly different items these items address directly the respondent s behaviour towards water use or water resources conservation in general more specifically the eurobarometer survey recorded the respondents everyday water conservation practices such as not leaving taps running taking shower instead of bath installing water saving appliances etc harvesting rainwater and avoiding the use of pesticides and fertilizers in the garden the respondents broader pro environmental behaviour regarding their adoption of conservation activities such as the preference for organic farm products and recycling of specific waste like oil waste unused pharmaceuticals unused household chemicals paints solvents and batteries were also recorded in the survey the respondents engagement with these items allowed us to build a basic psychographic profile of their environmentalism for each of the items the respondent was assigned one point if they declared engagement and zero otherwise thus a respondent could have a total score ranging from a maximum of seven if they were engaged in all activities down to zero if she was engaged to none of the activities we expect higher environmentalism to be associated with higher risk perceptions about the water environment consumption practices and behaviour is a very important social construct that in relation to environmental beliefs predict risk attitudes scientists agree that the most acute environmental issues such as resource depletion water pollution and climate change can eventually be assigned to inherent consumption practices embedded into everyday economic behaviour bolderdijk and steg 2015 regarding water the exclusive consumption of bottled water serves as an indicator of perceived risk in consuming tap water de frança doria 2010 while the exclusive consumption of tap water may indicate a pro environmental attitude however both these practices are likely to also be influenced by income constraints and consumption opportunities to some degree in the eurobarometer survey consumption practices were recorded by asking whether the respondent consumes exclusively bottled or tap water or both knowledge can be thought as a surrogate for salience with people who perceive an issue to be important to become more informed about the issue so perceived risk may pre occupy knowledge acquisition griffin et al 2004 on the contrary o connor et al 1999 conclude that prior knowledge is the main factor fostering behavioural intentions to act on environmental issues and not salience indeed steel et al 1990 report that in a split sample of canadian and american respondents self rated prior knowledge of pollution sources to water in the great lakes increased risk perceptions to canadian participants but decreased perceived risk to americans similarly mcdaniels et al 1997 found significant differences in risk perceptions between lay people and experts in the eurobarometer survey the level of knowledge and information was based on each respondent s personal judgment of the level of information related to problems facing groundwater lakes rivers and coastal waters in their country and their perception of the state of the water environment in the place they live we expect self rated knowledge and informedness regarding pressures on the water environment to be positively related to risk perceptions socio demographics such as gender age education occupation or income ethnicity and religion are related to perceived environmental risks either positively or negatively gender is so closely linked to risk perception that the white male effect is now a stylized fact kahan et al 2007 liobikienė and juknys 2016 this has been established as early as 1990 when steel et al reported women perceived threats to the water environment to be of significantly higher risk than was perceived by men while other studies bring into question the role of gender in determining risk perception e g slimak and dietz 2006 the weight of existing evidence leads us to predict that female respondents will perceive a greater risk to the water environment than male respondents depending on the threat under consideration age appears to have several sometimes contradictory effects for example slimak and dietz 2006 found a strong positive correlation between the respondents age and factors that captured the ecological chemical and biological scales of risk flint et al 2017 found a significant positive linear relationship between age and levels of concern across all four water risks under consideration in their study while toma and mathijs 2007 found a negative relationship between age and willingness to adopt water saving and water quality improving schemes in romania other researchers have found weak relations between age and risk perception on water pollution liobikienė and juknys 2016 when the impact of climate change on water is considered the influence of age on risk perceptions even more ambiguous frondel et al 2017 in almost all studies examining environmental risk perceptions education emerges as a major socio demographic determinant although the effect is not always the same respondents possessing higher levels of education tend to show higher levels of concern for water quality issues steel et al 1990 and increased willingness to adopt water improving schemes toma and mathijs 2007 however flint et al 2017 found that the respondents education was unrelated to their level of concern about water shortages and negatively correlated with water quality and flooding risks slimak and dietz 2006 report that a higher level of education was associated with lower concern of the respondent for ecological and biological risks while there was no significant relation with chemical risk the eurobarometer survey studied here does not record the respondent s education level but the age at which education was completed is recorded in general this is an adequate approximation of the respondent s education level which we postulate to be positively associated with risk perception table 1 presents the names definitions and descriptive statistics of the survey variables capturing perceived threats to the water environment socio demographic environmentalism information and knowledge and practice characteristics it also summarizes the effects of the variables on perceived threat as these were recorded in the relevant literature review above all the aforementioned factors potentially shape an individual s perceived risk in turn the level of perceived risk is a major determinant of mitigation and adaptation behaviour that is revealed through an individual s actions de frança doria 2010 such actions may include the adoption of new technologies or new consumption practices the purchase of insurances or the willingness of individuals to participate in public consultation activities to guide certain environmental outcomes furthermore an analysis of the factors related to perceived risk may allow policy makers at the local level to attempt to modify perceived risks or better target groups of citizens with high perceived risk to address their high concerns about environmental issues finally each respondent s contribution to the sample is weighted with pre specified weights when we present percentages or proportions at european or country level we weight the calculations with the weights provided by eurobarometer for the eu 27 mss for data analysis purposes and inference especially from complex regression structures we do not weight the data 2 2 weighting survey data is an extremely complicated and difficult issue especially when complex data structures e g hierarchical models are contemplated the interested reader can consult gelman 2007 with the associated discussion comments and rejoiner the price to pay for using the eurobarometer survey comes in the form of several limitations first perceived water environment threats are recorded as a yes no response and their perceived severity is not evaluated for example on a likert scale second pro environmental attitudes and in general environmentalism cannot be deduced with a formal model such as the nep this denies from the present survey comparability with other surveys that are based on the nep third the survey provides behavioural characteristics related to water consumption but it does not report the respondents use of water bodies for recreation sports or environmental activities e g birdwatching nature photography etc or as an element of their everyday landscape 2 2 geospatial data the flash eurobarometer 344 survey european commission 2012 recorded the place of residence in terms of the european hierarchy of spatial administrative units called nuts from the french nomenclature des unités territoriales statistiques for most countries this corresponds to the nuts2 spatial level which is the major administrative unit and the basic unit for the application of eu s policies this does not include germany and the uk which report at the nuts1 level the larger agglomerate of nuts2 regions or the small countries luxemburg cyprus malta estonia lithuania and latvia which report at the country level the responses concerning perceived threats to the water environment vary greatly among citizens living in the same country and among citizens living in different countries fig 1 shows the boxplots for the three risks in the 27 eu countries chemical pollution is unanimously perceived as the greatest threat to the water environment among eu citizens with very small differences among countries ranging from a minimum of 70 for finland to a maximum of 93 for the czech republic responses regarding algae growth and changes to ecosystems were more variable among countries for algae growth the weighted country proportion was as low as 10 for bulgaria and as high as 70 for respondents in france changes to ecosystems showed almost the same variation as algae growth with a low of 16 found for respondents in lithuania and a high of 73 for respondents in portugal when the same proportions are calculated at a regional scale intranational variations are similarly high for example as concerns the perceived threat of algae growth french respondents rank the top weighted country with an average of 70 however there are french nuts2 regions for which the percentage is considerably lower e g close to 54 in the region of haute normandie nuts2 code of fr23 in our analysis we assume that such country and regional differences are due to differences in the respondents characteristics as well as differences of the state of the environment within which the respondents work and live this can be used as a contextual or experiential variable same for all respondents living in the same region or same for all respondents living in the same country information on the various aspects of the water environment is not available at the same spatial level at which eurobarometer data are collected for this reason we utilize another set of spatially related data provided by the eu s water information system for europe wise wise records the percentage of area or the percentage of the length of water bodies that are classified in the five categories of ecological status for each rbd and for each river basin sub district a spatial unit that is smaller than the rbd the five categories are high good moderate poor and bad reflecting the abundance of aquatic flora and fauna the availability of nutrients aspects of salinity temperature pollution by chemical pollutants and alterations to morphological features such as water quantity flow and depth and the structure of the river beds wise also records at the rbd level only the chemical status of water bodies on a good fail dummy category and the proportion of water bodies affected by different impacts e g acidification altered habitats contaminated sediments contaminated water by priority substances nutrient and organic enrichment and the proportion of water bodies under various pressures such as diffuse and point source pollution water abstraction and morphological alterations we utilized gis overlay and intersection methodology to combine the river basin district and sub district layers and nuts layers to assign to each nuts region the characteristics of the water bodies enclosed by the nuts boundaries as such we could produce variables measuring the percentage of the length of water bodies a under each ecological status b under good fail chemical status and c under other impacts or various pressures 3 3 annex a of this work provides details and examples of the gis methodology used to upgrade rbds to nuts and an exposition to assumptions that had to be made at the administrative nuts level however not all rbds had classified all water bodies within their boundaries the first indicator ecological status was used as a proxy of a respondent s experience of the regional and national water ecosystem and as an explanatory variable to the ecosystem changes threat the percentage of the length of water bodies under good chemical condition is used as an explanatory variable to the chemical pollution threat from the various impacts and pressures recorded in wise we selected the percentage of the length of water bodies that are under pressure from diffused pollution as an explanatory variable to the algae growth threat in some of the rbds less than half of the water bodies had been classified according to their ecological or chemical status thus these rbds were excluded from the analysis because their environmental indicators could not be considered representative of the whole rbd the variability of the status of water bodies at the nuts level based on the above methodology was considerable indicatively map 1 shows the percentage of the length of water bodies whose ecological status has been classified as poor or bad upscaled at the nuts levels used by the eurobarometer it is worth noting that the largest part of poland and of italy are missing because almost all polish and most italian rbds had classified less than half of their water bodies to ecological status classes table 2 shows the proportions for various environmental indicators at the regional nuts or national level 2 3 a three level logistic regression model in this section we detail how we model the way in which respondents recognize each of the three threats to the water ecosystems considered the model is formulated using a latent variable framework suppose that underlying the binary response y i j k that a respondent i in region j of country k perceives algae growth chemical pollution or changes to ecosystems to be a threat or not is a continuous latent variable y i j k that generates the observed binary responses by the threshold model 1 y ijk 1 i f y ijk 0 respondent perceives this is a threat 0 i f y ijk 0 r e s p o n d e n t d o e s n o t p e r c e i v e t h i s i s a t h r e a t this latent response is 2 y i j k π 0 j k β i x ijk ε i j k where x ijk is a vector of respondent specific observable characteristics β i is a vector of coefficients to be estimated and π 0 j k is an intercept that is allowed to vary among regions j and countries k this intercept can be estimated using region specific characteristics as 3 π 0 j k π 00 k β j x jk ζ j k 2 where x jk is a vector of region specific characteristics i e same across all respondents within the region β j is a vector of coefficients to be estimated π 00 k is an intercept that is allowed to vary among countries k and ζ j k 2 is for this equation an error term called a random intercept that varies over regions level 2 and is distributed normally with mean 0 and variance ψ 2 as ζ j k 2 n 0 ψ 2 the intercept π 00 k can be estimated using country specific characteristics as 4 π 00 k π 000 β k x k ζ k 3 where x k is a vector of country specific characteristics i e same across all respondents within the country β k is a vector of coefficients to be estimated π 000 is an intercept and ζ k 3 is in this equation an error term called a random intercept that varies across countries level 3 and is distributed normally with mean 0 and variance ψ 3 as ζ k 3 n 0 ψ 3 if we substitute equation 4 into equation 3 and then the resultant expression into equation 2 we get y i j k π 000 β i x ijk β j x jk β k x k ζ j k 2 ζ k 3 ε i j k where ε i j k ζ k 3 ζ j k 2 x ijk follows a standard logistic distribution with variance π 2 3 thus the logit is formulated as 5 l o g i t p y ijk 1 x ijk ζ j k 2 ζ k 3 π 000 ζ j k 2 ζ k 3 β i x ijk β j x jk β k x k the term π 000 is referred to as the overall intercept and is interpreted as the log odds that the respondent perceives the threat when all x covariates and ζ j k 2 ζ k 3 are zero equation 5 is the expression of the typical three level random intercept logistic regression the β vector contains coefficients that capture simple effects of the respondent region and country predictors for continuous predictors such as age or environmentalism this is the effect of a 1 unit change on x from its grand centered value grand centering means that from each observation of a continuous variable we subtract its sample mean for dummy predictors this is the difference between the two levels of the dummy variable the ζ j k 2 and ζ k 3 random effects can be predicted and their interpretation is rather simple for two respondents who have identical observable characteristics and live in different regions of the same country the difference in their predicted ζ j k 2 will be their difference in the log odds that they perceive the threat and can be interpreted as the pure regional effect for two respondents who live in different countries and by definition in different regions and have identical observable characteristics the difference in the predicted sum ζ j k 2 ζ k 3 will be their difference in the log odds that they perceive the threat and can be interpreted as the combined locational region and country effect the three level random intercept logistic regression can be estimated using various software and or routines and various algorithms in this work we estimate the model of equation 5 above by using gllamm for the algae growth chemical pollution and change to ecosystems threats separately and produce predictions of the random intercepts at the second and third levels by using gllapred which are both stata programs rabe hesketh et al 2012 and gllamm s program site at http www gllamm org 3 results the model presented in equation 5 is estimated for each one of the three threats that we examine in this work by estimating first a null model i e a model without covariates then a model containing only first level covariates and then a full model containing covariates in all levels these models are nested and thus they can be compared using likelihood ratio tests table 3 presents the final models that by likelihood ratio tests are superior to a simple logistic regression which does not take account of the multilevel structure of the data to a null model i e a model without covariates and to a model without higher level covariates before deriving the final model we examined a series of alternative formulations containing either some meaningful transformations of the variables such as the quadratic interactions among covariates factorials cross interactions among covariates at different levels and random slope models even when there was some slight improvement in the model s statistical properties this was not enough to weight against the simplicity and interpretability of the presented models the results reported in table 3 are based on a sample that excludes all countries that do not have two or more regions almost 5000 observations so that the second regional and third national levels do not coincide as well as all regions which had not classified more than 50 of the length of their water bodies in 2012 around 2000 observations mainly in poland and italy and all regions which following the aforementioned truncation had less than 20 remaining respondents a statistical rule of thumb threshold to include a second level unit in the analysis however analysis in which all models are re fitted with varied samples show that the signs and significance of the coefficients are robust 4 4 results from alternative model formulations and of robustness tests with samples of varying sizes are available from the authors upon request 3 1 fixed effects our baseline respondent is female gender 0 has an age of 50 the centered age variable is 0 lives in small town rural 0 and large town 0 has finished education before the age of 14 education1 0 education2 0 is currently unemployed self employed 0 employee 0 retired 0 has adopted an average of 3 6 pro environmental activities the centered environment variable is 0 she is not very well or well informed about water issues inform 0 and she does not exclusively drink tap water tap water 0 in the region where the respondent lives and for the algae growth threat we assume that diffused source pollution diffused reg affects 0 of the length of water bodies for the chemical pollution threat we assume that 0 of the length of water bodies have good chemical status good chem reg for the ecosystem changes threat we assume that 0 of the length of water bodies are classified to a high and good status high good reg similarly for the country where the average respondent lives the corresponding figures are 0 for diffused nat 0 for good chem nat and 0 for high good nat we should be aware that the question recording perceived threats asks whether the respondent perceives a certain threat as such for the whole country and not for the region where she lives however a respondent s perception may be shaped by two elements the status of the environment at her immediate surrounding that comes from experience and from the status of the environment in the whole country that may come from experience through travelling or from information presented in the media the odds of perceiving algae growth as a threat to the country s water environment increase as the proportion of water bodies in the region experiencing diffused source pollution increases for this baseline respondent and assuming zero random effects the log odds of equation 5 for perceiving algae growth as a threat to the water environment is the constant 1 400 as reported in table 3 at the coefficients column for the algae growth threat by exponentiating this figure we find the odds that this respondent perceives algae growth as a threat to be e 1 400 0 247 in probabilistic terms the probability that this baseline respondent perceives algae growth as a threat is e 1 400 1 e 1 400 0 198 o r 19 8 and thus the probability that she does not perceive algae growth as a threat is 1 0 198 0 802 o r 80 2 now assume that this same respondent had finished education after the age of 22 instead of the age under 14 theoretically she would have had attained the higher educational level in the sample and the only change in the above estimations would come from the fact that the respondent has a value of one for the variable education2 thus the log odds change by the coefficient of this variable and are 1 400 0 242 1 158 with corresponding odds at e 1 158 0 314 and the probability that the respondent perceives algae growth as a threat calculated at e 1 158 1 e 1 158 0 239 o r 23 9 the odds ratios reported in table 3 show how the odds of perceiving algae growth as a threat increase odds ratio higher than 1 or decrease odds ratio less than 1 between the two values of a dummy variable or by increasing a continuous variable by one unit similarly we can interpret the figures reported for the threats of chemical pollution and ecosystem changes of table 3 the odds of perceiving chemical pollution as a threat to the country s water environment is negatively related to the proportion of the country s water bodies classified as having good chemical status there was no significant relationship with the corresponding regional proportion fig 2 shows the patterns between the individual differences that exert significant effects on the probability to perceive chemical pollution as a major threat to the water environment with the physical risk data measured by the percentage of the length of national water bodies classified as having good chemical status perceived threat and the percentage of good chemical status are negatively related a gender gap of almost 5 consistent with literature findings is maintained irrespective of the status of the physical environment perceived threat is positively related to education and negatively related to the level of information about water issues possessed by respondents the proportion of water bodies classified as high or good in the region is positively associated with the odds that ecosystem changes is perceived as a threat for the country s water environment at the same time the proportion of water bodies classified as high or good in the country is negatively associated with the odds that ecosystem changes is perceived as a threat 5 5 the correlation coefficient between the two variables measuring the proportion of water bodies classified as having high and good status at the regional and national levels is moderate at around 0 7 depending on the compositions of the sample considering the sign of the correlation coefficient between the two variables and the size of the standard errors of the coefficients the opposite signs of the coefficients cannot be attributed to collinearity this may indicate reverse causality or selection but due to the cross section sample we are not able to test for this pro environmental attitudes and activities are strongly related to the perception of all risks as expected by literature information is related only to the perception of the risk due to chemical pollution informed citizens have lower odds to perceive chemical pollution as a threat to the water environment also those respondents who drink exclusively tap water have lower odds of considering chemical pollution to be a threat to the water environment citizens in urban areas have higher odds to perceive chemical pollution as a major threat while residents of rural areas have lower odds to perceive ecosystem changes as a threat education is positively and substantially related to the odds of perceiving all the three threats as concerns the effects of gender we record a male effect where men are less likely to perceive chemical pollution and ecosystem changes as threats than women the respondents age is positively related to the odds of perceiving algae growth as a threat and negatively related to the odds of perceiving chemical pollution and ecosystem changes as threats 3 2 empirical bayes predictions of random effects empirical bayes predictions of random effects ζ j k 2 ζ k 3 are derived using the gllapred routine in stata rabe hesketh et al 2012 random effects should be interpreted as error terms that capture the unobserved heterogeneity of a spatial level in our work these terms are used to capture cultural and institutional heterogeneity resulting from the country and region membership of an observation interpret the third level random effects as the odds of perceiving a threat between two respondents who live in a different country but have exactly the same characteristics live in areas with the same physical characteristics of the water environment and in a typical region of their country predicted random effects ζ j k 2 ζ k 3 average to zero for a typical region or a typical country respectively caterpillars of the predicted country random effects for algae growth chemical pollution and ecosystem changes are shown in figs 3 5 the figures present the predicted random effects for 20 countries out of the 27 of the eurobarometer survey that remained in the analysis random effects for algae growth range from 1 33 for bulgaria to 1 33 for france for example the estimate for france is interpreted as the odds of the baseline respondent who lives in a typical region in france ζ j k 2 0 has almost double the odds of recognizing algae growth as a threat to her national water environment from a respondent with the same characteristics living in a typical region ζ j k 2 0 of a typical country ζ k 3 0 such as the netherlands denmark or austria on the contrary the bulgarian baseline respondent has almost half the odds of recognizing algae growth as a threat from a respondent with the same characteristics but living in the netherlands or denmark i e countries with zero random effect eight countries have 3rd level random predictions at around 0 6 odds of 1 8 another group of eight countries have predictions which do not differ significantly from 0 and three countries have negative random country prediction i e odds of less than one for chemical pollution random 3rd level effects have significantly lower range than the corresponding 3rd level random effects for algae growth and ecosystem changes as expected the group of countries which have very high or very low random effects in each threat is different for example greece scores very low for algae growth and very high for chemical pollution while random effects for finland are exactly the opposite france has high and bulgaria low random effects for all three threats the second level regional random effects ζ j k 2 also tell an interesting story for the chemical pollution threat the regional random effects deviate around zero and are not statistically significant for algae growth they range from 0 35 to 0 30 and have a statistically significant but quantitatively moderate to low impact in comparison to the respective third level national random effects for ecosystem changes the regional random effects range from 0 35 to 0 23 the variance among regional random effects reveals that there is a regional disparity element within national risk perception for algae growth and ecosystem changes but not for chemical pollution 4 conclusions and policy implications in this work we attempted to examine whether public perceived risks regarding the state of the water environment at the national level are associated with the actual state of the water environment as measured by a series of environmental indicators at the regional and national levels the results are consistent with the hypothesis that the state of the national and regional environment affects public perceptions of risks to the water environment perceived risk due to chemical pollution and due to ecosystem changes is closely related to the actual state of the national environment the better the state of the environment the lower the perceived risk the state of the regional environment i e the environment considered to have immediate interaction with the respondent is associated with the perception of risk due to algae growth with worse environmental indicators reflected by higher perceived risk however the ecological status of the regional environment is associated with perceived risk due to ecosystem changes in the opposite direction the larger the proportion of water courses that have been classified as high or good the higher the probability that ecosystem changes is perceived as a threat this result is very important and may be due either to reverse causality or to selection and needs further elaboration reverse causality may exist if citizens who think that ecosystem changes is a real threat have already acted to secure a high or good water environment these citizens are afraid of losing an achievement in their water environment for which they have invested efforts and resources selection may exist if citizens who consider ecosystem changes as a threat to the water environment have chosen to live in places that have high or good water environment these citizens may be afraid to lose a high water environment status for which they have implicitly paid through probably higher land market prices or higher rents as concerns other factors related to risk perception the results support previous research perceived risk is positively related to pro environmental activities the level of education and the gender the analysis also reaffirmed that age can have both positive and negative effects on risk perception this may hide a generational issue as concerns water environment threats with older generations being more sensitive to algae growth and younger generations to chemical pollution and changes to ecosystems the level of the respondent s information about water issues appears to reduce the probability of perceiving chemical pollution as a threat living in a rural environment is negatively related to the probability that chemical pollution and changes to ecosystems are recognized as threats results show that water related risk perceptions are context specific and are related to personal characteristics this has two implications for water policy design and delivery first it supports the eu s decision to plan and manage water resources at a low spatial level i e at the river basin district and to allow regional and national authorities to draw their own measures without prescribing recipes thus accommodating the diversity of the european union and the sensitivity of european citizens to their regional and national contexts second it shows that citizens can recognize and respond to water related risks in the 2012 eurobarometer survey 73 of respondents stated that the eu should propose additional measures for water problems to be addressed our results substantiate the need for a proper communication of policy reforms to european public which should be underpinned by a more credible evaluation of water environment risks results show that this communication can be more effective if information about specific water environment issues and policies target specific segments of the population campaigns aiming to raise awareness or to increase public participation or the proportion of volunteers for water conservation activities should be targeted segments can be created by clustering the population according to their age education and engagement to environmental activities and the status of the water environment in their region acknowledgment the authors

19426,adding conductive materials can promote methanogenesis via facilitating electron exchange between syntrophic bacteria and methanogenic archaea however little is known about how temperature would interact with such an addition and thus affect the compositions and characteristics of endogenous redox mediators erms in particular it is of strong interest to understand how the temperature variation would affect the improvement on methanogenesis induced by erms with conductive materials herein we have investigated the response of sludge methanogenesis to temperature variation from 15 to 35 c and spectroscopically detected the erms induced by conductive red mud it was demonstrated that the increasing temperature enhanced the stimulating effect of conductive red mud on methane accumulation and the methane production potential showed a linear relationship with redox parameters such as areal capacitance c a free charges r 2 and electron exchange capacity eec 2dcos spectra further indicated that ν c o and δ o h in humic acids β turn type iii amide i νs c o in cytochrome c and δ c h in amines and lipids became the main redox groups in erms at 35 c with the addition of red mud the model revealed that the contribution of erms to the co2 reduction to ch4 increased from 35 2 1 4 to 58 6 1 5 when the temperature increased from 15 to 35 c our finding that conductive materials stimulated the formation and electroactivity of erms with the increasing temperature during anaerobic digestion can have important implications for the improvement of engineered methanogenic processes graphical abstract image 1 keywords temperature red mud endogenous redox mediators erms spectroscopic elucidation functional groups 1 introduction anaerobic digestion of organic compounds in sludge and wastewater to methane is an effective and important approach to recover bioenergy from wastes rotaru et al 2014 the performance of anaerobic digestion is affected by the efficiency of interspecies electron transfer between syntrophic bacteria and methanogenic microbial communities zhang et al 2017 such an electron transfer process can be realized by either direct interspecies electron transfer diet that cell to cell electron transfer between species is achieved through shared physical electrical connections summers et al 2010 or mediated interspecies electron transfer that relies on redox mediators to shuttle electrons in the complex methanogenic environment kaden et al 2002 smith et al 2015 redox mediators harvest electrons from the reduced microbial sources and make them available to methanogenic microorganisms thereby effectively lowering the activation energy and improving the reaction rate li et al 2017 van der zee and cervantes 2009 different kinds of artificial redox mediators have been studied to accelerate the anaerobic digestion process yang et al 2012 beckmann et al 2016 however apart from some solid phase redox mediators such as humic substances cervantes et al 2011 the addition of most soluble mediators is not economically viable and may result in the secondary pollution extracellular polymeric substances eps the natural high molecular weight polymers are excreted by microorganisms during anaerobic digestion eps have been demonstrated to act as the transient media for microbial extracellular electron transfer and thus function as endogenous redox mediators erms xiao et al 2017 stolz 2001 it was illustrated that naturally produced riboflavin by shewanella oneidensis mr 1 could serve as erms for the reduction of hexavalent chromium cr vi for example adding 1 0 μmol l riboflavin increased the cr vi reduction by 20 in an microbial fuel cell xafenias et al 2013 eps production by shewanella species was induced by anthraquinone 2 sulfonate modified polyurethane foam aqs puf resulting in a 5 fold increase in nitrobenzene reduction compared to that without aqs puf wang et al 2013 the secretion of erms can also be triggered by the adding conductive materials our previous research suggested that the addition of red mud stimulated the production of erms such as c type cytochromes and humic substances during sludge methanogenesis which contributed to a 35 5 increase of methane production compared with the control ye et al 2018a b therefore it is of great interest to further investigate the effect of external conductive materials on enhancing the biological electrical contacts between electron donating and accepting partners towards improved performance of redox biotransformation the fractions of specific redox components in erms could be influenced by the external conditions sheng et al 2010 which may change the characteristics of the functional groups such as carboxyl phenol hydroxyl amine and quinine groups such changes will undoubtedly affect the specific redox process such as interspecies electron transfer for instance previous research has demonstrated that the most relevant erms supporting the interspecies electron transfer are humic substances and their quinoid analogue van der zee and cervantes 2009 however it was found that non quinoid structures in humus also had electron carrying capacity ecc at ph 6 5 whereas different quinoid structures showed ecc at ph 8 0 ratasuk and nanny 2007 in anaerobic digestion temperature is a key operational factor and can significantly affect methane production and waste treatment the generation of the reduced form of artificial redox mediators such as anthrahydroquinone 2 6 disulfonate ah2qds was accelerated with the increasing temperature which were beneficial for the redox biotransformation of contaminants dos santos et al 2004 siggins et al 2011 although adding conductive materials can increase erms little is known about how temperature will interact with such an addition and thus affect the compositions and characteristics of erms in particular it is of strong interest to understand how the temperature variation would affect the improvement on methanogenesis induced by erms with conductive materials in this study the effects of three operating temperatures 15 25 and 35 c on the improvement of sludge methanogenesis with conductive red mud were for the first time investigated the change in compositions and characteristics of erms under different temperatures was studied by using spectroscopic and electrochemical analysis the combination of which could provide the significant information on the mechanisms involved at the molecular level particularly a novel in situ fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2dcos method was used to investigate the erms temperature interaction and helped to understand the specific designation and structure change sequence of redox groups on erms under different temperatures furthermore the contribution of erms to methanogenenic activities was evaluated with a mathematic model and the preliminary technical and economic feasibility for the anaerobic digestion with the addition of conductive red mud under different temperatures was discussed these information provided the important implications for the improvement of engineered methanogenic processes because of the significant temperature variation related to seasonal changes 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the raw bayer red mud was provided by shandong aluminum industry corporation shandong china 35 5 m2 g brunauer emmett teller surface area ye et al 2018b its main mineral compositions included hematite fe2o3 45 46 aluminum oxide al2o3 17 14 quartz sio2 14 22 rutile tio2 14 81 and gibbsite al oh 3 5 32 the inoculum sludge was collected from a lab scale anaerobic digester the sludge from the secondary sedimentation tank of a local municipal wastewater treatment plant fuzhou china was used as the substrate in the first experiments the total chemical oxygen demand tcod and soluble chemical oxygen demand scod of the substrate sludge were 30 15 0 55 g l and 1 43 0 06 g l mean standard deviation respectively and the ratio between total suspended sludge tss and volatile suspended sludge vss ratio was 0 69 the electrical conductivity of red mud was measured by using the four probe gold electrodes according to li et al 2015 a cover glass was employed to form a confluent film of red mud on the surface of entire gold electrodes then the potential drop between the two inner electrodes was measured with a high impedance voltmeter under a fixed low current between the two outer electrodes 2 2 anaerobic digestion experiments the first experiment about the improvement of sludge methanogenesis with conductive red mud was conducted in 250 ml anaerobic serum bottles that contained 10 ml of sludge inocula and 90 ml of sludge substrate operated at 15 25 and 35 c those without addition of conductive materials were labeled as ck 15 ck 25 and ck 35 ck control the number represented the operating temperature other test bottles contained 2 0 g of red mud each and were labeled as rm 15 rm 25 and rm 35 rm red mud the number represented the operating temperature a strict anaerobic condition was created in the bottles by flushing the headspace with nitrogen gas methane can mainly be synthesized from acetate conversion or co2 reduction conductive red mud accelerated the interspecies electron transfer during the co2 reduction to methane through two pathways diet and erms ye et al 2018a b in order to evaluate the contribution of each pathway during the co2 reduction to methane under different temperatures the mixture of carbon dioxide and nitrogen gas 50 50 was used to replace the organic substrate for methanogenesis in the second experiment meanwhile 10 ml of sludge inocula and 90 ml of carbon free synthetic medium were also added into all the anaerobic serum bottles to provide nutrients for microbial growth the synthetic medium consisted of mg l of tap water 1000 kh2po4 1000 nh4cl 100 cacl2 100 mgcl2 6h2o 1 0 fecl3 0 5 znso4 7h2o 0 5 cocl2 6h2o 1 0 nicl2 6h2o 0 5 cuso4 5h2o and 0 5 mncl2 4h2o liu et al 2015 specifically the reactors without the addition of red mud were used to study the role of erms pathway while the reactors with 2 0 g red mud were employed to investigate the collective effects of diet and erms pathways on the co2 reduction to methane at 15 25 and 35 c all the experiments were conducted in biological triplicate differences were evaluated using student s t test and a p value 0 01 was considered statistically significant 2 3 analytical methods the analysis of tcod scod tss and vss was following the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha et al 2005 the ch4 and co2 concentrations were determined by using agilent 7890a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector fid the extraction of erms was conducted with the cation exchange resin method frølund et al 1996 the molecular weight of erms was then analyzed with a high performance liquid chromatography system hplc waters 1525 pump waters 2487 dual λ absorbance detector waters co usa and a shodex kw 802 5 gel chromatography column shoko japan zhang et al 2016 three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3 deem spectra were obtained by the cary eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer g9800a agilent technologies usa with an excitation range from 210 to 400 nm and an emission range from 290 to 525 nm in 10 nm sampling increments erms were electrochemically characterized by cyclic voltammetry cv and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis in a single chamber three electrode electrochemical cell with the extracted erms as electrolyte tang et al 2015 the eis spectra were then fitted using zsimpwin version 3 10 to obtain an equivalent circuit the areal capacitances c a mf cm2 were calculated to quantitatively describe the capacitive performance of the samples sarkar et al 2013 1 c a i f a where i a is the average current of the cv loop f v s is the scan rate and a cm2 is the area of the working electrode a chronoamperometry measurement was performed to quantify the electron accepting capacity eac and electron donating capacity edc of erms briefly zwitterionic viologen 4 4 bipyridinium 1 1 bis 2 ethylsulfonate ziv and 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonic acid diammonium salt abts 98 were used as an electron shuttle for electrochemical reduction mer and oxidation meo respective according to klüpfel et al 2014 and yu et al 2015 the desired redox potential for mer and meo were 0 49 v and 0 61 v respectively in addition electrochemical in situ ftir spectra were conducted with the method described by yang et al 2017 and sample potentials es were set at potentials 0 8 v to 0 6 v with an interval of 0 2 v the 2dcos spectra were obtained and analyzed according to the method reported by noda and ozaki 2004 the primers 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 806r 5 ggactacvsgggtatctaat 3 were used to amplify the v4 region of the 16s rrna gene samples were applied to an illumina miseq system for sequencing the detailed sequencing process could be found in ye et al 2018a 2 4 mathematical modeling modified gompertz model was selected to model the cumulative methane production as follows kafle and kim 2013 2 m p e x p e x p r max e p δ t 1 where m is the cumulative methane production mmol g vss p is the production potential mmol g vss r max is maximum methane production rate mmol g vss d δ is lag phase day and t is time day and e 2 7183 based on the results follow the second experiments the contribution of erms to the interspecies electron transfer during the co2 reduction to methane with red mud was evaluated with an analogous mathematical model reported by macdonald et al 2011 and yu et al 2015 the model was based on the following consideration 1 the co2 reduction to methane was conducted through diet and erms processes 2 the microbial biomass carbon on day 14 represented the biomass in the anaerobic digestion system and 3 the reduction rate of erms was proportional to their concentrations and biomass when the co2 reduction with a diet process occurred in the methane accumulation the methane production rate could be described as follows 3 d c h 4 d t α λ x c o 2 a d where α is the reaction rate constant between the conductive red mud and co2 λ is the electrical conductivity of red mud x represents the biomass and co 2 a d is the co2 concentration adsorbed by red mud for the co2 reduction with an erms pathway the kinetic equations could be expressed as follows 4 d c h 4 d t β e r m s r e d c o 2 d e r m s o x 2 d t d e r m s r e d 2 d t μ x e r m s o x c o 2 5 2 e e c e r m s o x e r m s r e d where β is the reaction rate constant between the reduced erms and co2 μ is the rate constant for the microbial reduction of erms and co 2 is the co2 concentration e r m s r e d and e r m s o x are the concentrations of reduced forms and oxidized form of erms respectively the proposed model equations were coded as differential equations in matlab 7 0 and solved using its ode45 program with the optimization function isqcurvefit 3 results and discussion 3 1 higher temperature enhanced the stimulating effect of red mud on methane production effects of temperature on methanogenesis were first investigated in the absence or presence of red mud fig 1 in the control reactors ck the maximum ch4 yield increased from 0 70 0 02 mmol g vss at 15 c to 1 04 0 05 mmol g vss at 35 c the addition of red mud significantly improved the methane production at each tested temperature resulting in the increased maximum ch4 yield by 20 49 6 41 29 67 6 13 and 35 52 2 72 at 15 25 and 35 c respectively the comparison of ch4 yield was conducted among the various types of conductive materials reported in the literature along with that of this study table s1 it was observed that a higher increase rate of ch4 yield was obtained with red mud under the similar dosage of conductive materials during anaerobic digestion indicating the potential advantages of red mud for enhancing the performance of anaerobic digestion these results have confirmed the beneficial effect of red mud on anaerobic digestion and such an effect could be further enhanced by the elevated temperature as shown in table 1 a modified gompertz model fitted the experimental data well with the r 2 value of 0 9901 0 9984 the duration of lag phase is an important factor to determine the efficiency of anaerobic digestion kafle and kim 2013 it was found that the lag time λ in the present study decreased dramatically with the increasing temperature suggesting the quicker start up of the anaerobic digestion process the addition of external substances might result in the extension of lag phase because microorganisms require a certain time to adapt the environmental change lópez maury et al 2008 however in this study red mud greatly shortened the lag phase at 15 and 25 c and this might be due to the conductive function of red mud that might have stimulated methanogens when they had a low activity at a low temperature in contrast the time of lag phase in the red mud reactor at 35 c was longer than that in the control reactor likely attributed to the fe iii reduction by fe iii reducing microorganisms which was a more favorable electron sink for acetate oxidation and thus the beneficial effect of red mud was weakened in the initial stage of anaerobic digestion the increase of the fe ii concentration in the solution indicated that about 9 04 of hematite participated in the fe iii reduction which might be due to its high crystallinity and low solubility lovley and phillips 1988 previous studies have demonstrated that the reduction of limited fe iii could promote the formation of conductive magnetite with the secondary mineralization process which could also act as conductive solid conduits for interspecies electron transfer ye et al 2018b after the reduction of limited fe iii methanogens became the predominant electron accepting microorganisms leading to more methane production in rm 35 than that of ck 35 the activities of key enzymes such as protease and dehydrogenase increased by 41 4 257 3 in rm 35 than that in ck 35 which could effectively promote the hydrolysis acidification of organic compounds in the sludge ye et al 2018b as a result more electrons from the microbial oxidation of substrates could be transferred to methanogens in the later stage of anaerobic digestion in rm 35 resulting in significantly improved maximum methane production rate and methane yield 3 2 higher temperature accelerated the excretion of erms induced by red mud to investigate the effect of temperature on the excretion of erms the sludge samples after 14 days of anaerobic digestion were taken for erms extraction as shown in fig 2 a three obvious mw peaks were observed in the erms that extracted from the control reactors ck 360 da 1200 da and 44000 da in contrast more peaks of main organic materials with low or middle mw were detected and strengthened in the red mud reactors when the temperature increased from 15 to 35 c 360 da 1200 da 2200 da 3300 da and 4000 da in particular the peak intensity of 44000 da which indicates high mw organic materials 5000 da mainly composed of proteins and polysaccharide zhang et al 2016 was significantly enhanced at a higher temperature and in the presence of red mud the change in mw profiles suggested that both the increase of temperature and addition of red mud accelerated the decomposition of organic materials into small compounds three components were identified in erms according to eem spectra including soluble microbial byproduct like substances 280 285 300 360 nm protein like substances 220 225 300 350 nm and fulvic acid like substances 220 240 370 420 nm fig 2 b g ye et al 2018b the fluorescent intensities of protein like and fulvic acid like substances became stronger with the increase of temperature especially in rm 25 and rm 35 those findings were consistent with mw analysis demonstrating that a higher temperature has effectively promoted the production of erms in the presence of conductive red mud the electron transfer ability of erms during sludge methanogenesis was investigated by using electrochemical analysis to measure the response of different erms to the application of a voltage as shown in fig 3 a obvious differences in current generation of the cv curves were observed suggesting the variations in the transient charge storage behavior of erms the areal capacitances c a value increased with the higher temperature and the maximum value reached 37 02 1 29 mf cm2 in rm 35 a linear correlation was observed between the areal capacitance c a and the methane production potential r 2 0 9069 fig 3b illustrating that the capacitance characteristics of erms were an importance indicator for methanogenesis which might act as a biocapacitor to store electrons from the microbial oxidation of the substrate and then release the accumulated charge as needed eis was also performed to further probe the electrochemical impedances of different erms it was found that the electric signature of erms evolved with the increase of temperature which was well fitted by an equivalent circuit with two resistors r 1 and r 2 and one capacitor c 1 fig 3c r 2 represented the resistance for the free charges transfer in the material ségalen et al 2015 the value of which decreased from 181 10 0 61 ω rm 15 to 151 31 0 92 ω rm 35 when the temperature increased from 15 to 35 c the electrical impedances of sample were determined by its charge and mobility ségalen et al 2015 in this study the electrical conductivity of red mud decreased with the increase of temperature and thus the improvement of electrochemical property of sludge samples might be related to enhanced production of erms with nature charges and high mobility during the hydrolysis acidification process the methane production potential showed an obvious negative correlation with r 2 r 2 0 8795 fig 3d smaller charge transfer resistance r 2 indicated a faster electron transfer rate chen et al 2016 correspondingly improving the performance of interspecies electron transfer and methane production to directly evaluate the redox property the edc and eac values of different erms were measured at an applied potential of 0 61 v the edc value in red mud reactor ranged from 0 26 0 02 to 0 39 0 01 μmol e g vss at an applied potential of 0 49 v the eac value ranged from 0 12 0 01 to 0 22 0 01 μmol e g vss fig 3e the sum of eac and edc which is electron exchange capacity eec showed a positive linear correlation r 2 0 9135 with the methane production potential fig 3f this correlation suggested that the total number of redox active moieties in erms was likely to determine the methane production because that the regenerable and sustainable conversion of accepting and donating moieties in erms effectively facilitated the electron transfer for co2 reduction to methane under methanogenic conditions these results demonstrated that the erms played an important role on the achievement of high performance of anaerobic digestion analysis of microbial communities revealed that clostridiaceae and ruminococcaceae the family about the hydrolyzing bacteria synergistaceae the family about the syntrophic amino acid oxidizing bacteria and syntrophomonadaceae the family about the syntrophic vfa oxidizing bacteria were the main bacteria after 14 days anaerobic digestion fig s1 zhao et al 2017 the relative abundances of these bacteria increased with the increase of temperature which facilitated the hydrolysis acidification process to produce more erms some identified bacteria might also participate in the electron transfer process such as clostridiaceae ruminococcaceae and geobacteraceae bordeleau et al 2015 among them geobacteraceae was demonstrated to participate in the direct interspecies electron transfer with some methanogens such as methanosaetaceae zhang et al 2017 while clostridiaceae and ruminococcaceae might perform interspecies h2 transfer with type iv pili jariyaboon et al 2015 in archaeal community the relative abundances of methanosaetaceae and methanosarcinaceae which could accept the electrons from the syntrophic species increased with the higher temperature in the red mud reactors lovley 2017 the analysis revealed that a higher content of erms induced by red mud with the increasing temperature has changed the microbial community structure and increased the relative abundances of the microorganisms that could participate in the interspecies electron exchange process during sludge methanogenesis 3 3 higher temperature affected the functional groups of erms induced by red mud the transition of the redox groups in erms during the temperature change was characterized by using electrochemical in situ ftir spectroscopy in the control reactors bands appeared at 1627 1363 1400 and 1370 cm 1 for erms fig 4 a it was noticed that 1627 cm 1 which was reported in relation to the extended β strand amide i νs c o in cytochrome c ataka and heberle 2004 increased with the potential shifting from 0 8 v to 0 6 v in contrast the peak at 1363 cm 1 which was assigned to the νs c o and δ c h possibly in amino acids badireddy et al 2010 disappeared with the increasing temperature meanwhile the new peaks of ν c o and δ o h in humic acids at 1400 cm 1 and νs c o of coo groups at 1370 cm 1 were detected zhu et al 2012 in addition it was found that the intensities of some bands varied with the elecotrode potentials the results demonstrated the presence of redox groups in erms because the potential dependent changes represented the occurrence of certain redox reactions during the potential shifting process similar results were also reported by qiao et al 2008 in which erms were demonstrated to serve as the reversible terminal electron acceptors and effectively facilitate the electron transfer in the presence of red mud two peaks at 1158 cm 1 ring vibrations ν p o ν c o c and ν c o p associated with hosphodiesters and polysaccharides liu et al 2015 and 1250 cm 1 δ c o and νs p o associated with either nucleic acids or phosphorylated proteins badireddy et al 2010 were observed in erms of rm 15 fig 4b when the temperature increased to 25 c these bands were replaced by 1642 cm 1 unordered amide i νs c o associated with the cytochrome c and 1400 cm 1 ν c o and δ o h associated with humic acids ataka and heberle 2004 the new band at 1673 cm 1 was observed in rm 35 which was reported to be related to β turn type iii amide i νs c o in cytochrome c ataka and heberle 2004 badireddy et al 2010 in addition at 1326 cm 1 the intensity of δ c h in amines and lipids increased when the potential increased from 0 8 to 0 6 v therefore it could be concluded that the addition of red mud has significantly altered the species and structure of redox groups which might have brought positive impacts on promoting the extracellular electron transfer and methane production processes the additional important information about the change of redox groups during the increase of temperature from 15 to 35 c was provided by 2dcos two predominant autopeaks were centered at 1627 and 1363 cm 1 in the synchronous map for the control reactors fig 4c the sign of the cross peak in the synchronous map was positive indicating that conformational change was in the same direction chen et al 2015 asynchronous map could not only facilitate the deconvolution of overlapping peaks but also present the helpful information about the sequential relationship between different redox groups two small peaks at 1400 and 1370 cm 1 were observed in asynchronous map fig 4d the detailed assignment of the bands and signs of their cross peaks in the asynchronous map is presented in table s2 according to noda s rule the change followed the order ν c o and δ o h νs c o of coo groups νs c o and δ c h extended β strand amide i νs c o in the red mud reactors three predominant autopeaks about 1642 1400 and 1250 cm 1 with a small peak at 1158 cm 1 were identified in the synchronous map fig 4e the signs of the cross peaks in the synchronous map associated with 1642 and 1400 cm 1 were positive conformational changes in the same direction while that associated with 1250 and 1158 cm 1 were negative conformational changes in the reverse direction except the signs of the cross peaks between 1250 and 1158 cm 1 the overlapping peaks at 1673 and 1326 cm 1 were distinguished in the asynchronous map fig 4f using the sequential order rules it was speculated that the structure change sequence followed the order δ c o and νs p o ring vibrations ν p o ν c o c and ν c o p unordered amide i νs c o ν c o and δ o h β turn type iii amide i νs c o δ c h table s3 the significant differences in the change sequence of redox groups with the increasing temperature between the control and red mud reactors indicated the different response mode of erms with the temperature change 3 4 higher temperature increased the contribution of erms to methanogenesis a kinetic model was employed to distinguish the role of erms in the co2 reduction to methane fig s2 after 28 days the amount of biomass increased by 1 38 0 47 fold when the temperature increased from 15 to 35 c in the presence of red mud table 2 correspondingly the contribution of erms to the co2 reduction to methane increased from 46 4 2 5 to 58 6 1 5 in rm 25 and rm 35 respectively significantly higher than 35 2 1 4 in rm 15 the results have demonstrated that erms would have played a more important role on methanogenesis with the increase of temperature in addition to the excellent electron exchange capacity of redox active sites the amount of which in erms increased with the increasing temperature and could be beneficial for the interspecies electron transfer process and a higher temperature also improved the intramolecular electron transfer rate liu and bolton 1992 this might indirectly accelerate the redox cycle of the erms and then increase its contribution on co2 reduction in this study it should be noted that the existence of redox mediators might not only affect the co2 reduction process but also the solubilization and acidification steps during the sludge fermentation because of its diverse chemical and physical properties such as hydrophobicity liu et al 2015 therefore future studies are warranted to focus on more detailed contribution of the erms to the metabolic pathway and further evidences to evaluate the positive role of erms during the sludge methanogenesis 3 5 preliminary technical and economic feasibility evaluation red mud is the byproduct of alumina production from bauxite that has an annual global production of approximately 120 million tons hua et al 2017 the production of red mud is expected to further increase in near future due to the increasing alumina demand and the decreasing grade of bauxite ore worldwide liu and naidu 2014 the findings of the present study encourages to take advantage of this extensive and accessible resource for accelerating anaerobic digestion thereby lowering the need for additional energy to heat the digester in the case of significant seasonal temperature variation meanwhile the high alkaline nature of the initial red mud ph 10 12 5 poses a serious environmental risk during its transport and disposal wang et al 2008 the ph decrease of red mud during anaerobic digestion was beneficial for its resource utilization furthermore using red mud to enhance anaerobic digestion also has other potential benefits including simple operation and the additional provision of micro and macronutrients such as manganese and sodium for the growth of microorganisms a preliminary economic estimation was also conducted to evaluate the potential industrial application of red mud for real sludge digestion the cost per ton red mud treatment is about 1 70 paramguru et al 2004 yang and xiao 2008 when red mud is applied as a conductive material for anaerobic digestion at the dosage of 20 g l the disposal cost of red mud can potentially be saved by 4 93 per ton of sludge treatment furthermore the addition of red mud promotes the sludge reduction based on the average sludge treatment cost of 135 per ton in china yang et al 2015 the increased reduction of sludge by red mud can result in the decrease of the sludge disposal cost by 17 61 21 52 and 29 35 at 15 25 and 35 c per ton of sludge treatment respectively moreover according to hirano and matsumoto 2018 the increased methane yield per ton of sludge treated with red mud cost about 0 01 0 03 and 0 04 at 15 25 and 35 c respectively in conclusion the increased economic value per ton sludge treated with red mud can be 22 55 26 48 and 34 32 at 15 25 and 35 c respectively which was an attractive economic incentive to promote the application of this technology 4 conclusions this study represents a promising platform to deeper understand the importance of erms induced by conductive materials on methanogenesis with the spectroscopic methodology it was demonstrated that the increasing temperature enhanced the stimulating effect of conductive red mud on methane accumulation and the methane production pontential showed a linear relationship with redox parameters such as areal capacitance c a free charges r 2 and electron exchange capacity eec meanwhile the change of temperature affected the contents and key functional groups of erms which further influenced their contributions on the biogeochemical redox processes such as the co2 reduction to methane the findings have important implications not only for the optimization of engineered methanogenic processes but also for the estimation of methane production in natural and engineered environments such as soils and sediments

19426,adding conductive materials can promote methanogenesis via facilitating electron exchange between syntrophic bacteria and methanogenic archaea however little is known about how temperature would interact with such an addition and thus affect the compositions and characteristics of endogenous redox mediators erms in particular it is of strong interest to understand how the temperature variation would affect the improvement on methanogenesis induced by erms with conductive materials herein we have investigated the response of sludge methanogenesis to temperature variation from 15 to 35 c and spectroscopically detected the erms induced by conductive red mud it was demonstrated that the increasing temperature enhanced the stimulating effect of conductive red mud on methane accumulation and the methane production potential showed a linear relationship with redox parameters such as areal capacitance c a free charges r 2 and electron exchange capacity eec 2dcos spectra further indicated that ν c o and δ o h in humic acids β turn type iii amide i νs c o in cytochrome c and δ c h in amines and lipids became the main redox groups in erms at 35 c with the addition of red mud the model revealed that the contribution of erms to the co2 reduction to ch4 increased from 35 2 1 4 to 58 6 1 5 when the temperature increased from 15 to 35 c our finding that conductive materials stimulated the formation and electroactivity of erms with the increasing temperature during anaerobic digestion can have important implications for the improvement of engineered methanogenic processes graphical abstract image 1 keywords temperature red mud endogenous redox mediators erms spectroscopic elucidation functional groups 1 introduction anaerobic digestion of organic compounds in sludge and wastewater to methane is an effective and important approach to recover bioenergy from wastes rotaru et al 2014 the performance of anaerobic digestion is affected by the efficiency of interspecies electron transfer between syntrophic bacteria and methanogenic microbial communities zhang et al 2017 such an electron transfer process can be realized by either direct interspecies electron transfer diet that cell to cell electron transfer between species is achieved through shared physical electrical connections summers et al 2010 or mediated interspecies electron transfer that relies on redox mediators to shuttle electrons in the complex methanogenic environment kaden et al 2002 smith et al 2015 redox mediators harvest electrons from the reduced microbial sources and make them available to methanogenic microorganisms thereby effectively lowering the activation energy and improving the reaction rate li et al 2017 van der zee and cervantes 2009 different kinds of artificial redox mediators have been studied to accelerate the anaerobic digestion process yang et al 2012 beckmann et al 2016 however apart from some solid phase redox mediators such as humic substances cervantes et al 2011 the addition of most soluble mediators is not economically viable and may result in the secondary pollution extracellular polymeric substances eps the natural high molecular weight polymers are excreted by microorganisms during anaerobic digestion eps have been demonstrated to act as the transient media for microbial extracellular electron transfer and thus function as endogenous redox mediators erms xiao et al 2017 stolz 2001 it was illustrated that naturally produced riboflavin by shewanella oneidensis mr 1 could serve as erms for the reduction of hexavalent chromium cr vi for example adding 1 0 μmol l riboflavin increased the cr vi reduction by 20 in an microbial fuel cell xafenias et al 2013 eps production by shewanella species was induced by anthraquinone 2 sulfonate modified polyurethane foam aqs puf resulting in a 5 fold increase in nitrobenzene reduction compared to that without aqs puf wang et al 2013 the secretion of erms can also be triggered by the adding conductive materials our previous research suggested that the addition of red mud stimulated the production of erms such as c type cytochromes and humic substances during sludge methanogenesis which contributed to a 35 5 increase of methane production compared with the control ye et al 2018a b therefore it is of great interest to further investigate the effect of external conductive materials on enhancing the biological electrical contacts between electron donating and accepting partners towards improved performance of redox biotransformation the fractions of specific redox components in erms could be influenced by the external conditions sheng et al 2010 which may change the characteristics of the functional groups such as carboxyl phenol hydroxyl amine and quinine groups such changes will undoubtedly affect the specific redox process such as interspecies electron transfer for instance previous research has demonstrated that the most relevant erms supporting the interspecies electron transfer are humic substances and their quinoid analogue van der zee and cervantes 2009 however it was found that non quinoid structures in humus also had electron carrying capacity ecc at ph 6 5 whereas different quinoid structures showed ecc at ph 8 0 ratasuk and nanny 2007 in anaerobic digestion temperature is a key operational factor and can significantly affect methane production and waste treatment the generation of the reduced form of artificial redox mediators such as anthrahydroquinone 2 6 disulfonate ah2qds was accelerated with the increasing temperature which were beneficial for the redox biotransformation of contaminants dos santos et al 2004 siggins et al 2011 although adding conductive materials can increase erms little is known about how temperature will interact with such an addition and thus affect the compositions and characteristics of erms in particular it is of strong interest to understand how the temperature variation would affect the improvement on methanogenesis induced by erms with conductive materials in this study the effects of three operating temperatures 15 25 and 35 c on the improvement of sludge methanogenesis with conductive red mud were for the first time investigated the change in compositions and characteristics of erms under different temperatures was studied by using spectroscopic and electrochemical analysis the combination of which could provide the significant information on the mechanisms involved at the molecular level particularly a novel in situ fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2dcos method was used to investigate the erms temperature interaction and helped to understand the specific designation and structure change sequence of redox groups on erms under different temperatures furthermore the contribution of erms to methanogenenic activities was evaluated with a mathematic model and the preliminary technical and economic feasibility for the anaerobic digestion with the addition of conductive red mud under different temperatures was discussed these information provided the important implications for the improvement of engineered methanogenic processes because of the significant temperature variation related to seasonal changes 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the raw bayer red mud was provided by shandong aluminum industry corporation shandong china 35 5 m2 g brunauer emmett teller surface area ye et al 2018b its main mineral compositions included hematite fe2o3 45 46 aluminum oxide al2o3 17 14 quartz sio2 14 22 rutile tio2 14 81 and gibbsite al oh 3 5 32 the inoculum sludge was collected from a lab scale anaerobic digester the sludge from the secondary sedimentation tank of a local municipal wastewater treatment plant fuzhou china was used as the substrate in the first experiments the total chemical oxygen demand tcod and soluble chemical oxygen demand scod of the substrate sludge were 30 15 0 55 g l and 1 43 0 06 g l mean standard deviation respectively and the ratio between total suspended sludge tss and volatile suspended sludge vss ratio was 0 69 the electrical conductivity of red mud was measured by using the four probe gold electrodes according to li et al 2015 a cover glass was employed to form a confluent film of red mud on the surface of entire gold electrodes then the potential drop between the two inner electrodes was measured with a high impedance voltmeter under a fixed low current between the two outer electrodes 2 2 anaerobic digestion experiments the first experiment about the improvement of sludge methanogenesis with conductive red mud was conducted in 250 ml anaerobic serum bottles that contained 10 ml of sludge inocula and 90 ml of sludge substrate operated at 15 25 and 35 c those without addition of conductive materials were labeled as ck 15 ck 25 and ck 35 ck control the number represented the operating temperature other test bottles contained 2 0 g of red mud each and were labeled as rm 15 rm 25 and rm 35 rm red mud the number represented the operating temperature a strict anaerobic condition was created in the bottles by flushing the headspace with nitrogen gas methane can mainly be synthesized from acetate conversion or co2 reduction conductive red mud accelerated the interspecies electron transfer during the co2 reduction to methane through two pathways diet and erms ye et al 2018a b in order to evaluate the contribution of each pathway during the co2 reduction to methane under different temperatures the mixture of carbon dioxide and nitrogen gas 50 50 was used to replace the organic substrate for methanogenesis in the second experiment meanwhile 10 ml of sludge inocula and 90 ml of carbon free synthetic medium were also added into all the anaerobic serum bottles to provide nutrients for microbial growth the synthetic medium consisted of mg l of tap water 1000 kh2po4 1000 nh4cl 100 cacl2 100 mgcl2 6h2o 1 0 fecl3 0 5 znso4 7h2o 0 5 cocl2 6h2o 1 0 nicl2 6h2o 0 5 cuso4 5h2o and 0 5 mncl2 4h2o liu et al 2015 specifically the reactors without the addition of red mud were used to study the role of erms pathway while the reactors with 2 0 g red mud were employed to investigate the collective effects of diet and erms pathways on the co2 reduction to methane at 15 25 and 35 c all the experiments were conducted in biological triplicate differences were evaluated using student s t test and a p value 0 01 was considered statistically significant 2 3 analytical methods the analysis of tcod scod tss and vss was following the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha et al 2005 the ch4 and co2 concentrations were determined by using agilent 7890a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector fid the extraction of erms was conducted with the cation exchange resin method frølund et al 1996 the molecular weight of erms was then analyzed with a high performance liquid chromatography system hplc waters 1525 pump waters 2487 dual λ absorbance detector waters co usa and a shodex kw 802 5 gel chromatography column shoko japan zhang et al 2016 three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3 deem spectra were obtained by the cary eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer g9800a agilent technologies usa with an excitation range from 210 to 400 nm and an emission range from 290 to 525 nm in 10 nm sampling increments erms were electrochemically characterized by cyclic voltammetry cv and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis in a single chamber three electrode electrochemical cell with the extracted erms as electrolyte tang et al 2015 the eis spectra were then fitted using zsimpwin version 3 10 to obtain an equivalent circuit the areal capacitances c a mf cm2 were calculated to quantitatively describe the capacitive performance of the samples sarkar et al 2013 1 c a i f a where i a is the average current of the cv loop f v s is the scan rate and a cm2 is the area of the working electrode a chronoamperometry measurement was performed to quantify the electron accepting capacity eac and electron donating capacity edc of erms briefly zwitterionic viologen 4 4 bipyridinium 1 1 bis 2 ethylsulfonate ziv and 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonic acid diammonium salt abts 98 were used as an electron shuttle for electrochemical reduction mer and oxidation meo respective according to klüpfel et al 2014 and yu et al 2015 the desired redox potential for mer and meo were 0 49 v and 0 61 v respectively in addition electrochemical in situ ftir spectra were conducted with the method described by yang et al 2017 and sample potentials es were set at potentials 0 8 v to 0 6 v with an interval of 0 2 v the 2dcos spectra were obtained and analyzed according to the method reported by noda and ozaki 2004 the primers 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 806r 5 ggactacvsgggtatctaat 3 were used to amplify the v4 region of the 16s rrna gene samples were applied to an illumina miseq system for sequencing the detailed sequencing process could be found in ye et al 2018a 2 4 mathematical modeling modified gompertz model was selected to model the cumulative methane production as follows kafle and kim 2013 2 m p e x p e x p r max e p δ t 1 where m is the cumulative methane production mmol g vss p is the production potential mmol g vss r max is maximum methane production rate mmol g vss d δ is lag phase day and t is time day and e 2 7183 based on the results follow the second experiments the contribution of erms to the interspecies electron transfer during the co2 reduction to methane with red mud was evaluated with an analogous mathematical model reported by macdonald et al 2011 and yu et al 2015 the model was based on the following consideration 1 the co2 reduction to methane was conducted through diet and erms processes 2 the microbial biomass carbon on day 14 represented the biomass in the anaerobic digestion system and 3 the reduction rate of erms was proportional to their concentrations and biomass when the co2 reduction with a diet process occurred in the methane accumulation the methane production rate could be described as follows 3 d c h 4 d t α λ x c o 2 a d where α is the reaction rate constant between the conductive red mud and co2 λ is the electrical conductivity of red mud x represents the biomass and co 2 a d is the co2 concentration adsorbed by red mud for the co2 reduction with an erms pathway the kinetic equations could be expressed as follows 4 d c h 4 d t β e r m s r e d c o 2 d e r m s o x 2 d t d e r m s r e d 2 d t μ x e r m s o x c o 2 5 2 e e c e r m s o x e r m s r e d where β is the reaction rate constant between the reduced erms and co2 μ is the rate constant for the microbial reduction of erms and co 2 is the co2 concentration e r m s r e d and e r m s o x are the concentrations of reduced forms and oxidized form of erms respectively the proposed model equations were coded as differential equations in matlab 7 0 and solved using its ode45 program with the optimization function isqcurvefit 3 results and discussion 3 1 higher temperature enhanced the stimulating effect of red mud on methane production effects of temperature on methanogenesis were first investigated in the absence or presence of red mud fig 1 in the control reactors ck the maximum ch4 yield increased from 0 70 0 02 mmol g vss at 15 c to 1 04 0 05 mmol g vss at 35 c the addition of red mud significantly improved the methane production at each tested temperature resulting in the increased maximum ch4 yield by 20 49 6 41 29 67 6 13 and 35 52 2 72 at 15 25 and 35 c respectively the comparison of ch4 yield was conducted among the various types of conductive materials reported in the literature along with that of this study table s1 it was observed that a higher increase rate of ch4 yield was obtained with red mud under the similar dosage of conductive materials during anaerobic digestion indicating the potential advantages of red mud for enhancing the performance of anaerobic digestion these results have confirmed the beneficial effect of red mud on anaerobic digestion and such an effect could be further enhanced by the elevated temperature as shown in table 1 a modified gompertz model fitted the experimental data well with the r 2 value of 0 9901 0 9984 the duration of lag phase is an important factor to determine the efficiency of anaerobic digestion kafle and kim 2013 it was found that the lag time λ in the present study decreased dramatically with the increasing temperature suggesting the quicker start up of the anaerobic digestion process the addition of external substances might result in the extension of lag phase because microorganisms require a certain time to adapt the environmental change lópez maury et al 2008 however in this study red mud greatly shortened the lag phase at 15 and 25 c and this might be due to the conductive function of red mud that might have stimulated methanogens when they had a low activity at a low temperature in contrast the time of lag phase in the red mud reactor at 35 c was longer than that in the control reactor likely attributed to the fe iii reduction by fe iii reducing microorganisms which was a more favorable electron sink for acetate oxidation and thus the beneficial effect of red mud was weakened in the initial stage of anaerobic digestion the increase of the fe ii concentration in the solution indicated that about 9 04 of hematite participated in the fe iii reduction which might be due to its high crystallinity and low solubility lovley and phillips 1988 previous studies have demonstrated that the reduction of limited fe iii could promote the formation of conductive magnetite with the secondary mineralization process which could also act as conductive solid conduits for interspecies electron transfer ye et al 2018b after the reduction of limited fe iii methanogens became the predominant electron accepting microorganisms leading to more methane production in rm 35 than that of ck 35 the activities of key enzymes such as protease and dehydrogenase increased by 41 4 257 3 in rm 35 than that in ck 35 which could effectively promote the hydrolysis acidification of organic compounds in the sludge ye et al 2018b as a result more electrons from the microbial oxidation of substrates could be transferred to methanogens in the later stage of anaerobic digestion in rm 35 resulting in significantly improved maximum methane production rate and methane yield 3 2 higher temperature accelerated the excretion of erms induced by red mud to investigate the effect of temperature on the excretion of erms the sludge samples after 14 days of anaerobic digestion were taken for erms extraction as shown in fig 2 a three obvious mw peaks were observed in the erms that extracted from the control reactors ck 360 da 1200 da and 44000 da in contrast more peaks of main organic materials with low or middle mw were detected and strengthened in the red mud reactors when the temperature increased from 15 to 35 c 360 da 1200 da 2200 da 3300 da and 4000 da in particular the peak intensity of 44000 da which indicates high mw organic materials 5000 da mainly composed of proteins and polysaccharide zhang et al 2016 was significantly enhanced at a higher temperature and in the presence of red mud the change in mw profiles suggested that both the increase of temperature and addition of red mud accelerated the decomposition of organic materials into small compounds three components were identified in erms according to eem spectra including soluble microbial byproduct like substances 280 285 300 360 nm protein like substances 220 225 300 350 nm and fulvic acid like substances 220 240 370 420 nm fig 2 b g ye et al 2018b the fluorescent intensities of protein like and fulvic acid like substances became stronger with the increase of temperature especially in rm 25 and rm 35 those findings were consistent with mw analysis demonstrating that a higher temperature has effectively promoted the production of erms in the presence of conductive red mud the electron transfer ability of erms during sludge methanogenesis was investigated by using electrochemical analysis to measure the response of different erms to the application of a voltage as shown in fig 3 a obvious differences in current generation of the cv curves were observed suggesting the variations in the transient charge storage behavior of erms the areal capacitances c a value increased with the higher temperature and the maximum value reached 37 02 1 29 mf cm2 in rm 35 a linear correlation was observed between the areal capacitance c a and the methane production potential r 2 0 9069 fig 3b illustrating that the capacitance characteristics of erms were an importance indicator for methanogenesis which might act as a biocapacitor to store electrons from the microbial oxidation of the substrate and then release the accumulated charge as needed eis was also performed to further probe the electrochemical impedances of different erms it was found that the electric signature of erms evolved with the increase of temperature which was well fitted by an equivalent circuit with two resistors r 1 and r 2 and one capacitor c 1 fig 3c r 2 represented the resistance for the free charges transfer in the material ségalen et al 2015 the value of which decreased from 181 10 0 61 ω rm 15 to 151 31 0 92 ω rm 35 when the temperature increased from 15 to 35 c the electrical impedances of sample were determined by its charge and mobility ségalen et al 2015 in this study the electrical conductivity of red mud decreased with the increase of temperature and thus the improvement of electrochemical property of sludge samples might be related to enhanced production of erms with nature charges and high mobility during the hydrolysis acidification process the methane production potential showed an obvious negative correlation with r 2 r 2 0 8795 fig 3d smaller charge transfer resistance r 2 indicated a faster electron transfer rate chen et al 2016 correspondingly improving the performance of interspecies electron transfer and methane production to directly evaluate the redox property the edc and eac values of different erms were measured at an applied potential of 0 61 v the edc value in red mud reactor ranged from 0 26 0 02 to 0 39 0 01 μmol e g vss at an applied potential of 0 49 v the eac value ranged from 0 12 0 01 to 0 22 0 01 μmol e g vss fig 3e the sum of eac and edc which is electron exchange capacity eec showed a positive linear correlation r 2 0 9135 with the methane production potential fig 3f this correlation suggested that the total number of redox active moieties in erms was likely to determine the methane production because that the regenerable and sustainable conversion of accepting and donating moieties in erms effectively facilitated the electron transfer for co2 reduction to methane under methanogenic conditions these results demonstrated that the erms played an important role on the achievement of high performance of anaerobic digestion analysis of microbial communities revealed that clostridiaceae and ruminococcaceae the family about the hydrolyzing bacteria synergistaceae the family about the syntrophic amino acid oxidizing bacteria and syntrophomonadaceae the family about the syntrophic vfa oxidizing bacteria were the main bacteria after 14 days anaerobic digestion fig s1 zhao et al 2017 the relative abundances of these bacteria increased with the increase of temperature which facilitated the hydrolysis acidification process to produce more erms some identified bacteria might also participate in the electron transfer process such as clostridiaceae ruminococcaceae and geobacteraceae bordeleau et al 2015 among them geobacteraceae was demonstrated to participate in the direct interspecies electron transfer with some methanogens such as methanosaetaceae zhang et al 2017 while clostridiaceae and ruminococcaceae might perform interspecies h2 transfer with type iv pili jariyaboon et al 2015 in archaeal community the relative abundances of methanosaetaceae and methanosarcinaceae which could accept the electrons from the syntrophic species increased with the higher temperature in the red mud reactors lovley 2017 the analysis revealed that a higher content of erms induced by red mud with the increasing temperature has changed the microbial community structure and increased the relative abundances of the microorganisms that could participate in the interspecies electron exchange process during sludge methanogenesis 3 3 higher temperature affected the functional groups of erms induced by red mud the transition of the redox groups in erms during the temperature change was characterized by using electrochemical in situ ftir spectroscopy in the control reactors bands appeared at 1627 1363 1400 and 1370 cm 1 for erms fig 4 a it was noticed that 1627 cm 1 which was reported in relation to the extended β strand amide i νs c o in cytochrome c ataka and heberle 2004 increased with the potential shifting from 0 8 v to 0 6 v in contrast the peak at 1363 cm 1 which was assigned to the νs c o and δ c h possibly in amino acids badireddy et al 2010 disappeared with the increasing temperature meanwhile the new peaks of ν c o and δ o h in humic acids at 1400 cm 1 and νs c o of coo groups at 1370 cm 1 were detected zhu et al 2012 in addition it was found that the intensities of some bands varied with the elecotrode potentials the results demonstrated the presence of redox groups in erms because the potential dependent changes represented the occurrence of certain redox reactions during the potential shifting process similar results were also reported by qiao et al 2008 in which erms were demonstrated to serve as the reversible terminal electron acceptors and effectively facilitate the electron transfer in the presence of red mud two peaks at 1158 cm 1 ring vibrations ν p o ν c o c and ν c o p associated with hosphodiesters and polysaccharides liu et al 2015 and 1250 cm 1 δ c o and νs p o associated with either nucleic acids or phosphorylated proteins badireddy et al 2010 were observed in erms of rm 15 fig 4b when the temperature increased to 25 c these bands were replaced by 1642 cm 1 unordered amide i νs c o associated with the cytochrome c and 1400 cm 1 ν c o and δ o h associated with humic acids ataka and heberle 2004 the new band at 1673 cm 1 was observed in rm 35 which was reported to be related to β turn type iii amide i νs c o in cytochrome c ataka and heberle 2004 badireddy et al 2010 in addition at 1326 cm 1 the intensity of δ c h in amines and lipids increased when the potential increased from 0 8 to 0 6 v therefore it could be concluded that the addition of red mud has significantly altered the species and structure of redox groups which might have brought positive impacts on promoting the extracellular electron transfer and methane production processes the additional important information about the change of redox groups during the increase of temperature from 15 to 35 c was provided by 2dcos two predominant autopeaks were centered at 1627 and 1363 cm 1 in the synchronous map for the control reactors fig 4c the sign of the cross peak in the synchronous map was positive indicating that conformational change was in the same direction chen et al 2015 asynchronous map could not only facilitate the deconvolution of overlapping peaks but also present the helpful information about the sequential relationship between different redox groups two small peaks at 1400 and 1370 cm 1 were observed in asynchronous map fig 4d the detailed assignment of the bands and signs of their cross peaks in the asynchronous map is presented in table s2 according to noda s rule the change followed the order ν c o and δ o h νs c o of coo groups νs c o and δ c h extended β strand amide i νs c o in the red mud reactors three predominant autopeaks about 1642 1400 and 1250 cm 1 with a small peak at 1158 cm 1 were identified in the synchronous map fig 4e the signs of the cross peaks in the synchronous map associated with 1642 and 1400 cm 1 were positive conformational changes in the same direction while that associated with 1250 and 1158 cm 1 were negative conformational changes in the reverse direction except the signs of the cross peaks between 1250 and 1158 cm 1 the overlapping peaks at 1673 and 1326 cm 1 were distinguished in the asynchronous map fig 4f using the sequential order rules it was speculated that the structure change sequence followed the order δ c o and νs p o ring vibrations ν p o ν c o c and ν c o p unordered amide i νs c o ν c o and δ o h β turn type iii amide i νs c o δ c h table s3 the significant differences in the change sequence of redox groups with the increasing temperature between the control and red mud reactors indicated the different response mode of erms with the temperature change 3 4 higher temperature increased the contribution of erms to methanogenesis a kinetic model was employed to distinguish the role of erms in the co2 reduction to methane fig s2 after 28 days the amount of biomass increased by 1 38 0 47 fold when the temperature increased from 15 to 35 c in the presence of red mud table 2 correspondingly the contribution of erms to the co2 reduction to methane increased from 46 4 2 5 to 58 6 1 5 in rm 25 and rm 35 respectively significantly higher than 35 2 1 4 in rm 15 the results have demonstrated that erms would have played a more important role on methanogenesis with the increase of temperature in addition to the excellent electron exchange capacity of redox active sites the amount of which in erms increased with the increasing temperature and could be beneficial for the interspecies electron transfer process and a higher temperature also improved the intramolecular electron transfer rate liu and bolton 1992 this might indirectly accelerate the redox cycle of the erms and then increase its contribution on co2 reduction in this study it should be noted that the existence of redox mediators might not only affect the co2 reduction process but also the solubilization and acidification steps during the sludge fermentation because of its diverse chemical and physical properties such as hydrophobicity liu et al 2015 therefore future studies are warranted to focus on more detailed contribution of the erms to the metabolic pathway and further evidences to evaluate the positive role of erms during the sludge methanogenesis 3 5 preliminary technical and economic feasibility evaluation red mud is the byproduct of alumina production from bauxite that has an annual global production of approximately 120 million tons hua et al 2017 the production of red mud is expected to further increase in near future due to the increasing alumina demand and the decreasing grade of bauxite ore worldwide liu and naidu 2014 the findings of the present study encourages to take advantage of this extensive and accessible resource for accelerating anaerobic digestion thereby lowering the need for additional energy to heat the digester in the case of significant seasonal temperature variation meanwhile the high alkaline nature of the initial red mud ph 10 12 5 poses a serious environmental risk during its transport and disposal wang et al 2008 the ph decrease of red mud during anaerobic digestion was beneficial for its resource utilization furthermore using red mud to enhance anaerobic digestion also has other potential benefits including simple operation and the additional provision of micro and macronutrients such as manganese and sodium for the growth of microorganisms a preliminary economic estimation was also conducted to evaluate the potential industrial application of red mud for real sludge digestion the cost per ton red mud treatment is about 1 70 paramguru et al 2004 yang and xiao 2008 when red mud is applied as a conductive material for anaerobic digestion at the dosage of 20 g l the disposal cost of red mud can potentially be saved by 4 93 per ton of sludge treatment furthermore the addition of red mud promotes the sludge reduction based on the average sludge treatment cost of 135 per ton in china yang et al 2015 the increased reduction of sludge by red mud can result in the decrease of the sludge disposal cost by 17 61 21 52 and 29 35 at 15 25 and 35 c per ton of sludge treatment respectively moreover according to hirano and matsumoto 2018 the increased methane yield per ton of sludge treated with red mud cost about 0 01 0 03 and 0 04 at 15 25 and 35 c respectively in conclusion the increased economic value per ton sludge treated with red mud can be 22 55 26 48 and 34 32 at 15 25 and 35 c respectively which was an attractive economic incentive to promote the application of this technology 4 conclusions this study represents a promising platform to deeper understand the importance of erms induced by conductive materials on methanogenesis with the spectroscopic methodology it was demonstrated that the increasing temperature enhanced the stimulating effect of conductive red mud on methane accumulation and the methane production pontential showed a linear relationship with redox parameters such as areal capacitance c a free charges r 2 and electron exchange capacity eec meanwhile the change of temperature affected the contents and key functional groups of erms which further influenced their contributions on the biogeochemical redox processes such as the co2 reduction to methane the findings have important implications not only for the optimization of engineered methanogenic processes but also for the estimation of methane production in natural and engineered environments such as soils and sediments

education college of environment hohai university nanjing 210098 china the residual dissolved organic matter dom and nitrate in sewage treatment plant stp effluent have potential negative impacts on the aqueous environment to that end we used formic acid fa to enhance the photochemical behavior of the photocatalytic membrane for the simultaneous removal of dom and nitrate from secondary stp effluent effluent samples were collected from two different biological treatment processes anaerobic oxic and anaerobic anoxic oxic membrane bioreactor respectively through fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms analysis we found that the addition of fa resulted in a similar molecular transformation in different stp effluent samples besides the radical signal of the carboxyl anion could be observed during the photocatalytic process based on the results we proposed the mechanism of the process that carboxyl anion radicals generated by fa could attack dom and result in further oxidation of the dom transition state to co2 or small molecule by nitrate meanwhile chon and chos compounds in dom were attacked by the carboxyl anion radicals more easily than cho compounds moreover long term use of the membrane confirmed its durability and reusability in practical applications at a moderate fa concentration and lower hydraulic retention time the nitrate and dom removal efficiencies for the sample from jx stp were 68 and 70 respectively whereas those of the cd stp sample were 85 and 60 the removal of dom and nitrate from different stp effluents using photocatalytic membranes is an advanced approach for the treatment of secondary effluent and may be applicable to other membranes or systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords secondary effluent photocatalytic dissolved organic matter nitrate ft icr ms 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom and nitrogen removal the objective of urban sewage treatment plants stps have been optimized through numerous biological treatment methods such as activated sludge processes canals et al 2013 oxidation ditch li and jin 2014 zuo et al 2013 sequencing batch reactor gabarró et al 2013 kulkarni 2012 biological membranes maza márquez et al 2016 mitra et al 2016 and anaerobic bacteria dessì et al 2016 yayabeas et al 2015 however the residual dom and nitrogen in the effluent may cause eutrophication dodds et al 2009 jules et al 2003 meanwhile dom may be a precursor for toxic disinfection by products dbps before it undergoes processes such as chlorination or ozonation carvajal et al 2017 lv et al 2017b mao et al 2018 these may be attributed by some facts that the residual concentrations of dom and nitrate in the effluent are too low to be simultaneously removed via biodegradation reverse osmosis ro membrane possesses the high rejection for removing dom and nitrate dražević et al 2017 which has been applied to clean the secondary effluent in stps tay et al 2018 luo et al 2017 however the popularization of ro technology in the stps could be hindered by two major challenges one challenge is that the water output of ro membrane is low with high operating and maintenance costs pal and kumar 2014 cui et al 2016 the other is the disposal of ro concentrate wang et al 2016 pérez gonzález et al 2012 recently a large amount of research efforts to exploit some alternative membrane technologies like microfiltration and ultrafiltration to ro membrane via incorporating photocatalytic materials into the membrane filtration systems goei and lim 2014 liu et al 2013 for example jiang et al 2015 designed the coating layer of the crumpled graphene oxide nanocomposite on the surface of the poly ether sulfone pes membrane the membrane has a higher flux than ro membrane and it could achieve an effective photodegradation to remove small molecule organics methyl orange during the filtration process due to the fact that the redox between dom and nitrate is hard to be implemented in the low concentration by the photocatalytic process heretofore few research was reported to use the photocatalytic membrane to simultaneously remove dom and nitrate from the stp secondary effluent building upon a novel approach that enhance the redox between dom and nitrate via the addition of some substances may be a key to achieve the application of photocatalytic membrane in the stp secondary effluent formic acid abbreviated as fa is a simple organic which has a photochemical behavior in the removal of nitrate and dom in the previous reports ren et al 2015 wehbe et al 2009 doudrick et al 2013 it was found that fa could produce the carboxyl anion radicals co2 to reduce the nitrate during the photocatalytic process for the removal of dom fa has the photoinduced properties similar to acetylacetone zhang et al 2014 wu et al 2016 that can enhance the degradation of methyl orange dye via generating oh radicals wang et al wang and bai 2016 added fa to the methyl orange dye solution under the uv vis light irradiation and achieved as high as 81 8 of the mineralization rate in 1 5 h in this study we fabricated a uniform linbo3 coating layer on a polyethersulfone pes membrane via layer by layer self assembly and fa was applied to enhancing the redox between dom and nitrate during the concurrent filtration and photocatalysis to further evaluate the effect of fa on the synergy between dom and nitrate removal we assessed the molecular transformation of dom and nitrate during the concurrent filtration and photocatalysis considering the complexity of dom composition we applied fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms to determine the change of molecular formulas for dom based on these results the capability of the photocatalytic membrane for molecular degradation of dom and nitrate in the long term operation was evaluated and the mechanisms in simultaneous removal of dom and nitrate was discussed 2 materials

following a routine phase inversion method gohari et al 2013 park et al 1999 with pvp as a pore forming agent polyethersulfone pes and pvp were fully dissolved in nmp at a pes pvp nmp ratio of 18 4 78 the solution was then poured onto a glazed glass plate to form a 150 μm film using an automatic flat membrane casting machine the plate was then immersed quickly in deionized water for 15 min and the pes support formed when the film coagulated to stably coat the membrane surface with photocatalytic materials linbo3 preparation is detailed in si the pes support should be modified with polyelectrolytes first we sprayed the pes support with a fresh 200 mg dopamine solution with 100 ml of 10 mm tris hcl with a ph of 8 5 to facilitate self polymerization the dopamine on the pes support was then exposed to air after leaving the support for 8 h we filtered the resulting solution 100 ml of 100 mg l 1 linbo3 in 2 g l 1 pei under a vacuum at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min 1 onto the polydopamine pda coated pes the pei linbo3 coated pes that had been washed with di water was then soaked in a 2 g l 1 paa solution for 1 h the photocatalytic membrane was dried overnight at 25 c after being washed three times with ethyl alcohol 2 3 sampling and sample analysis effluent samples were obtained at different times of the day 6 am 2 pm and 10 pm from two different stps jiang xin zhou jx and cheng dong cd located in nanjing south east china these stps use two different biological treatment processes which were anaerobic oxic and anaerobic anoxic oxic membrane bioreactor respectively the jx stp has a treatment capacity of 640 000 m3 d 1 and serves 94 km2 of residential and commercial areas in and around the yuhuatai district the treatment capacity of the cd stp is 200 000 m3 d 1 and it serves 174 km2 in and around the qinhuai district fig 1 the samples of jx and cd stp were collected from the effluent of the secondary clarifier and membrane bioreactor respectively then the samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane to remove suspended solids and colloids before they were stored in brown glass bottles at 4 c and transported to the lab for treatment or analyses a toc analyser toc v cpn shimadzu was used to measure the dissolved organic carbon doc concentration of the effluents a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2401pc shimadzu was used to determine the optical properties of the dom such as the suva254 and e2 e3 values suva254 is the ratio of the absorbance of a sampling solution at 254 nm to its doc while e2 e3 is the specific value for absorbance at 250 and 365 nm weishaar et al 2003 ft icr ms solarix xr 7 0t bruker was used to determine the structure of dom the ms was operated for negative ion formation and the dom mass spectrum was collected in the mass range from m z 150 to 700 ion chromatography lc 10a shimadzu was applied to quantify the concentrations of no3 no2 and nh4 in the effluents total nitrogen was measured by alkaline potassium persulfate digestion uv spectrophotometric method the dissolved organic nitrogen is calculated by subtracting no3 n no2 n nh4 n from total nitrogen total dissolved solids were conducted by the evaporation weight of solution a zeta potentiometer zetasizer nano zs malvern was used to detect the zeta ξ potentials of the effluents each trial was conducted in triplicate and the average values of these were presented as the results 2 4 concurrent filtration and photocatalysis operations the effect of fa addition on the simultaneous removal of dom and nitrate was performed by concurrent filtration and photocatalysis abbreviated as cfp operations prior to the cfp operations the performance of adsorption and rejection on the photocatalytic membrane was evaluated besides the parameters of photocatalytic membrane was displayed in table 1 the membranes were placed on an ultrafiltration cup millipore 8400 emd millipore usa with a continuous flow of 20 l m 2 h 1 to filter the effluent samples in the absence of uv irradiation after 6 h of filtration the permeate solution was collected for analysing the nitrates and dom the cfp operation was implemented by a customised device fig 2 that was equipped with two uv lamps 40 w 365 nm philips usa a photocatalytic module a permeate tank and a pump the operation consists of several internal re circulations and the time for completing each re circulation is about 106min formic acid fa was added to the feed solution 500 ml at dosages of 0 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 mmol l 1 respectively air is piped into the photocatalytic module to create the trans membrane pressure and maintain the flux at 100 l m 2 h 1 as long as the feed solution and formic acid are added with the irradiation of uv light 0 92 mw cm 2 after the solution was completely filtered into the permeate tank 10 ml of the permeate solution was collected for analysis the solution was then recirculated back to the membrane module for the next cycle 2 5 long term operation for removing dom and nitrate to verify the long term performance of the photocatalytic membrane for dom and nitrate removal the system was operated for 28 days with moderate fa addition and fewer operation cycles which were based on the removal efficiency of cfp fresh feed solution 500 ml was injected into the membrane module by a pump after internal cfp recirculation ceased the permeate flux of the membrane module was maintained at 100 l m 2 h 1 and the initial trans membrane pressure tmp was 20 kpa membrane backwash was performed for 20 min using a naocl solution approximately 200 ppm available chlorine at 1 bar when the trans membrane pressure tmp exceeded 60 kpa 3 results and discussion 3 1 basic water quality parameters the water quality parameters of the samples collected from the cd and jx stps in july 2017 are presented in table 2 the tn and doc concentrations decreased throughout the treatment processes which were anaerobic oxic and anaerobic anoxic oxic membrane bioreactor for the jx and cd stp effluents respectively no3 n was the main nitrogenous pollutant in the effluent and constituted most of the tn the doc concentration in the sample from the cd stp was 13 97 mg l 1 which was lower than that in the sample from jx stp 19 21 mg l 1 the zeta potential of all the samples indicated a negative charge and the total dissolved solids tds in the samples from the cd and jx stps were 378 and 565 mg l 1 respectively 3 2 changes in nitrate during cfp operation at the absence of uv irradiation and formic acid the nitrate could not be adsorbed or rejected by the membrane while approximately 5 6 and 4 5 of the dissolved organic nitrogen don could be removed from the jx and cd stp samples respectively table s1 fig 3 a and b suggest that the fa could enhance the reduction of nitrate during the photocatalytic process there was a gradual decline in the tn of the sample solutions after cfp operation which was more apparent with a higher fa dosage when the fa dosage was increased to 2 mmol l 1 the no3 concentrations in the effluent from the jx and cd stps decreased to 1 11 and 1 24 mg l 1 respectively after the second cfp cycle furthermore the concentration of no2 decreased after an initial increase the change observed in the water samples from jx was particularly evident when the fa dosage increased after the first cfp cycle the reduction in don and the increase in nh4 were mild while no changes in their concentrations were observed during the subsequent cycles 3 3 changes in dom during cfp 3 3 1 changes in doc and residual fa fig 3c shows that the removal of doc from the sampling solution of the jx stp was significant at the higher fa dosage exceeding 1 5 mmol l 1 similar results were obtained for the cd stp sampling solution which was even more sensitive to fa dose fig 3d the doc increased slightly when a low dosage of fa was added to the feed after the fifth cfp the doc concentration in the jx stp sampling solution 2 0 mmol l 1 decreased from 19 21 to 4 1 mg l 1 while that in the cd stp samples decreased from 13 97 to 4 46 mg l 1 besides the dissolved oxygen concentration of sampling solution is maintained at the range of 6 1 6 6 mgl 1 23 c during the photocatalytic process detailed in table s4 the residual fa was reduced to 0 31 and 0 47 mg l 1 hcooh c in the filtered jx and cd solutions respectively while the filtration ph exceeded 6 4 table s2 when the fa dosage was 1 5 mmol l 1 as there is no specific discharge standard for fa from stps in china or other countries we assessed the environmental risks of fa according to the occupational exposure standard of 5 ppm set by the american occupational safety and health administration osha the residual fa levels in the filtered jx and cd solutions 1 19 and 1 8 ppm respectively were not expected to result in environmental risks towards humans furthermore fa naturally occurs in fruits and honey and it is easily oxidized into co2 and h2o in the natural environment thus the low residual fa level in the filtered solution should not negatively impact the aquatic environment 3 3 2 changes in optical properties during cfp the suva254 and e2 e3 values are pivotal optical properties of dom as they can reflect its aromaticity and composition massalha et al 2018 boyle et al 2009 the suva254 value is positively correlated with the aromaticity of dom while the e2 e3 value is negatively correlated with the molecular weight maizel and remucal 2017 fig 4 a and b displayed that the addition of fa during cfp operation could enhance the decrease of the aromaticity and molecular weight of dom and it could remove dom from the secondary jx stp effluent more efficiently throughout the internal cfp cycles the suva254 value of the two sampling filtrates decreased meanwhile after the fifth cfp with a fa dosage of 2 mmol l 1 the e2 e3 value gradually increased from 4 91 to 5 22 and 5 35 to 5 83 in the cd and jx stp effluents the suva254 value was higher in the secondary effluent of the cd stp than that of the jx stp while the e2 e3 value followed the opposite trend this could be due to differences between the treatment processes of the two stps the a2 o mbr process is used in the cd stp which may produce more microbially derived dom than the a o process used in the jx stp the higher aromaticity and molecular weight of the dom in the secondary effluent of the cd stp may indirectly determine its photodegradability this is consistent with the results presented in fig 4b the increase of the e2 e3 value was more apparent in the jx stp sampling solution than that in the cd stp furthermore during the initial cfp operation the addition of fa could contribute to the increase in suva254 the suva254 value of the jx stp filtrate was 1 48 l mg c 1 m 1 after the first cfp at a fa dosage of 0 5 mmol l 1 this was higher than that of the sampling solution without fa 1 36 l mg c 1 m 1 the results could be attributed to the fact that the non aromatic organics are preferentially degraded during photocatalysis in the low fa concentration 3 3 3 changes in the molecular composition of dom during cfp according to the results presented in figs 3 and 4 the removal of nitrate and doc was synergetic at a high fa dose to further elucidate the changes in the molecular composition of dom after the cfp operations with high strength fa esi ft icr ms measurements were taken to analyse the transformation of the molecules in dom we used the van krevelen diagrams of the water samples treated by five cfp cycles at a fa dosage of 1 5 mmol l 1 to explain the transformation of individual dom molecules according to previous reports mesfioui et al 2012 smith et al 2013 van krevelen diagrams can be composed of seven regions that correspond to different dom compositions to visualize the formulae of each water sample the boundaries of each region were established from the stoichiometric ranges such as the h c and o c values and were described in si the formulae that only contained cho chon and chos in dom are the most abundant occupying 40 7 46 3 17 5 21 2 and 23 7 26 4 of all the formulas assigned in the negative mode respectively table s3 as shown in fig 5 a and d the points representing the cho formulas in the raw jx and cd stp effluent were semblable and located in the protein carbohydrate lignin carboxylic rich alicyclic molecule cram like structure and tannin regions after cfp operation with the photocatalytic membrane the apparent transformations in the molecular compositions of the jx and cd stp effluent were captured the formulas removed from the two effluent samples were concentrated in the lignin cram like structure regions in which the o c value ranged from 0 1 to 0 5 however the formulas produced in the cd stp effluent were mainly scattered in the carbohydrate region with high o c and h c values of 0 7 1 0 and 1 5 2 0 respectively the points corresponding to the chon compounds were more dense in the jx stp sample than those in the cd stp sample fig 5b and e which is consistent with the data in table s3 the compounds removed from the two water samples were scattered in the low o c region 0 5 while the resistant compounds were distributed in the high o c region 0 6 furthermore the chon molecules produced contained more formulas in the lipid region o c 0 3 than the cho and chos molecules the changes in the molecular compositions of the chos formulae were similar to those of the cho formulas and more significantly the removed compounds exhibited an intense dispersal in regions with o c and h c values ranging from 0 3 to 0 6 and 1 0 to 1 6 respectively the van krevelen diagrams further indicate that during the cfp process the o c and h c values of dom in the stp effluent could be affected by the addition of fa which consumes oxygen deficient substances and produces oxygen rich substances some molecules with high h c 1 5 and low o c values 0 3 were produced in the chon formulas following cfp the functional group of these molecules is more likely to contain an amino group and a few aromatic structures to explain the variations in the dom molecules after the addition of fa we tested two parameters average carbon oxidation state osca and double bond equivalent dbe to evaluate the change in the degree of unsaturation in the composition of dom after five cfp operations at different fa dosages osca is the average carbon oxidation state which is defined as the charge a carbon atom would take if it were to lose all their electrons contained bonds with more electronegative atoms but gain all the electrons contained in bonds with less electronegative atoms kroll et al 2011 as the diversity in the atomic electronegativity follows the order o c h the presence of different bonds in molecules will contribute to diverse osc values the c o double bond such as that in carboxyl groups contributes 2 osc and the c o bond such as that in alcohol groups contributes 1 osc while c h bonds contribute 1 osc lv et al 2017a dbe is the double bond equivalent calculated as dbe c 1 2h 1 2n 1 stenson et al 2003 fig 6 shows the changes in the molecular weight m z osca value and dbe in the cho chon and chos compounds before and after cfp operation the proportion of 500 700 m z values in the cd stp secondary effluent was higher than that in the jx stp secondary effluent which is consistent with the e2 e3 values measured in the optical dom properties analysis the molecular weights of the two stp effluent samples decreased as the fa concentration increased and the m z values were mainly distributed within a range of 200 400 after the cfp after the addition of fa the osca values of all compounds were more positive and the average dbe value decreased besides compared to cho composition there were notable changes in the osca and dbe values of the chon and chos compositions based on the results of esi ft icr ms measurements it seems to be confirmed that fa exerts the photo induced effect on the oxidation of dom and the effect could be more easily to be achieved in the chon and chos composition of dom 3 4 removal efficiency of dom and nitrate during long term operation according to the cfp operation results the photocatalytic membrane could retain its effectiveness under the following conditions recirculating the solution to the membrane four times with 1 5 mmol l 1 of fa under such conditions only 1 34 and 2 1 mg l 1 of fa remained in the filtered solutions from the jx and cd stps respectively the system was operated for 28 days with a constant flux of 100 l m 2 h 1 resulting in a total of 92 operation cycles once an operation cycle end the fresh feed solution 500 ml will be injected into the membrane module for the next operation cycle each operation cycle will be experienced by 4 identical internal recirculation and its hydraulic retention time hrt was 7 h figs 7a and 6 b show the tmp profiles of the jx and cd stp effluents respectively during cfp for the secondary effluent from jx stp the membrane was backwashed five times the cleaning cycle of the first backwash was 162 5 h approximately 6 75 days while the final cycle was 115 h approximately 4 75 days the increase in tmp for the cd stp sample was more notable than that for the jx stp sample as six backwashes were required after each cleaning step the tmp could not return to its initial value of 20 kpa and was slightly higher than its previous value fig 7c and d illustrate the operational performances residual fa and the nitrate and dom removal efficiencies of cfp for the jx and cd stp effluents respectively the residual fa concentrations in the filtered solutions from the jx and cd stps were maintained at 1 5 and 2 2 mg l 1 respectively though there was a slight fluctuation in addition after the final backwashing the removal efficiencies of nitrate and dom from the jx stp sampling solution were maintained at 68 and 70 respectively whereas those of cd stp were approximately 85 and 60 3 5 the mechanisms in simultaneous removal of dom and nitrate based on aforementioned results we proposed the positive role of co2 in the photodecomposition of dom the mechanisms can be summarized in scheme 1 first the photocatalytic membrane is irradiated by uv light and then it will produce a mass of holes h on the membrane surface then hcoo can capture holes to produce the carboxyl anion radicals co2 and h in a low dosage of formic acid the carboxyl anion radicals is likely to be directly oxidized to co2 by nitrate while in a high one some carboxyl anion radicals may attack dom and result in a transition state meanwhile the transition state of dom can be oxidized to co2 or small molecules by nitrate in order to further verify the possibility of this pathway we changed some photocatalytic conditions for the simultaneous removal of dom and nitrate detailed in table 3 for example instead of air n2 was applied to provide a trans membrane pressure to drive the solution through the membrane during the photocatalytic process the solution was collected for electron spin resonance spectroscopy esr analysis with 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo besides after the process the remove efficiency of nitrate and dom for each trial were calculated as shown in table 3 the radical signal of co2 could be observed in the experimental groups of 1 and 2 while oh radicals were appeared in 6 that the solution was filtered by pes membrane with the addition of fa and under the irradiation of uv light the difference of radical signal verify the role of the photocatalytic membrane that provide h for fa to produce the co2 radicals besides as compared to other experimental groups 3 to 8 the 1 and 2 possess a significant removal efficiency for dom and nitrate these results suggest that formic acid generates co2 radicals via the photocatalytic membrane can be considered as a key stage in the photochemical process in addition the dom removal efficiency in the 3 was slight higher than the 4 which were 13 4 and 11 8 in the jx stp samples 18 1 and 17 9 in cd stp samples respectively the subtle differences of dom removal efficiency between the 3 and 4 indicate that h had negligible effects on nitrate to oxidize dom meanwhile the change of the gas that provide a trans membrane pressure causes an unconspicuous variation for removing dom which was conducted by the comparation of some experimental groups such 1 and 2 4 and 5 6 and 7 it means that the dissolved oxygen is difficult to oxidize dom during the photochemical process which is consistent with the slight change of dissolved oxygen in cfp operation detailed in table s4 according to the results in table 3 the proposed pathways could be used for interpreting the mechanisms in simultaneous removal of dom and nitrate in the previous reports on the photoreduction behavior of the carboxyl anion radicals wang and zhang 2011 tachikawa et al 2004 the co2 radicals can attack some organic matters such methyl viologen perchloroalkanes and perfluorooctanoic acid to produce the transition state of organic matters due to the complexity of the transition state for dom the esr spectra is failed to detect the radical signal from it besides the results of esi ft icr ms measurements suggested that chon and chos compositions of dom may be more easily to be removed by nitrate than that of cho compositions after they are attacked by co2 these however warrant a further investigation in the further 3 6 environmental implications fa enhanced photocatalytic membranes for the simultaneous removal of dom and nitrate provides a feasible approach to treating the secondary effluent of stps with the addition of moderate quantities of fa the redox between low strength nitrate and dom could be implemented meanwhile the residual fa should not negatively impact the aquatic environment 4 conclusions in this study we developed a photocatalytic membrane for simultaneous removal of dom and nitrate from the secondary effluents of sewage treatment plants the optical properties such suva254 and e2 e3 and results of ft icr ms analysis were compared molecular transformation in the secondary effluents from the jx and cd stps was related to the addition of fa for example oxygen deficient substances such as lignins and aromatic molecules were more likely to be consumed while lower molecular weight substances with lower dbe and more positive osc values were more likely to be produced long term cfp operation demonstrated that the membrane is durable and reusable in practical applications with the addition of moderate quantities of fa and lower hydraulic retention time the nitrate and dom removal efficiencies for the jx stp sample were maintained at 85 and 70 respectively while those of the cd stp sample were approximately 70 and 60 respectively the residual fa did not pose a significant environmental risk further efforts to enhance the performance of simultaneous dom and nitrate removal processes for sewage treatment plant effluents may be based on the application of photocatalytic materials such as linbo3 to membrane surfaces acknowledgements we gratefully

education college of environment hohai university nanjing 210098 china the residual dissolved organic matter dom and nitrate in sewage treatment plant stp effluent have potential negative impacts on the aqueous environment to that end we used formic acid fa to enhance the photochemical behavior of the photocatalytic membrane for the simultaneous removal of dom and nitrate from secondary stp effluent effluent samples were collected from two different biological treatment processes anaerobic oxic and anaerobic anoxic oxic membrane bioreactor respectively through fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms analysis we found that the addition of fa resulted in a similar molecular transformation in different stp effluent samples besides the radical signal of the carboxyl anion could be observed during the photocatalytic process based on the results we proposed the mechanism of the process that carboxyl anion radicals generated by fa could attack dom and result in further oxidation of the dom transition state to co2 or small molecule by nitrate meanwhile chon and chos compounds in dom were attacked by the carboxyl anion radicals more easily than cho compounds moreover long term use of the membrane confirmed its durability and reusability in practical applications at a moderate fa concentration and lower hydraulic retention time the nitrate and dom removal efficiencies for the sample from jx stp were 68 and 70 respectively whereas those of the cd stp sample were 85 and 60 the removal of dom and nitrate from different stp effluents using photocatalytic membranes is an advanced approach for the treatment of secondary effluent and may be applicable to other membranes or systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords secondary effluent photocatalytic dissolved organic matter nitrate ft icr ms 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom and nitrogen removal the objective of urban sewage treatment plants stps have been optimized through numerous biological treatment methods such as activated sludge processes canals et al 2013 oxidation ditch li and jin 2014 zuo et al 2013 sequencing batch reactor gabarró et al 2013 kulkarni 2012 biological membranes maza márquez et al 2016 mitra et al 2016 and anaerobic bacteria dessì et al 2016 yayabeas et al 2015 however the residual dom and nitrogen in the effluent may cause eutrophication dodds et al 2009 jules et al 2003 meanwhile dom may be a precursor for toxic disinfection by products dbps before it undergoes processes such as chlorination or ozonation carvajal et al 2017 lv et al 2017b mao et al 2018 these may be attributed by some facts that the residual concentrations of dom and nitrate in the effluent are too low to be simultaneously removed via biodegradation reverse osmosis ro membrane possesses the high rejection for removing dom and nitrate dražević et al 2017 which has been applied to clean the secondary effluent in stps tay et al 2018 luo et al 2017 however the popularization of ro technology in the stps could be hindered by two major challenges one challenge is that the water output of ro membrane is low with high operating and maintenance costs pal and kumar 2014 cui et al 2016 the other is the disposal of ro concentrate wang et al 2016 pérez gonzález et al 2012 recently a large amount of research efforts to exploit some alternative membrane technologies like microfiltration and ultrafiltration to ro membrane via incorporating photocatalytic materials into the membrane filtration systems goei and lim 2014 liu et al 2013 for example jiang et al 2015 designed the coating layer of the crumpled graphene oxide nanocomposite on the surface of the poly ether sulfone pes membrane the membrane has a higher flux than ro membrane and it could achieve an effective photodegradation to remove small molecule organics methyl orange during the filtration process due to the fact that the redox between dom and nitrate is hard to be implemented in the low concentration by the photocatalytic process heretofore few research was reported to use the photocatalytic membrane to simultaneously remove dom and nitrate from the stp secondary effluent building upon a novel approach that enhance the redox between dom and nitrate via the addition of some substances may be a key to achieve the application of photocatalytic membrane in the stp secondary effluent formic acid abbreviated as fa is a simple organic which has a photochemical behavior in the removal of nitrate and dom in the previous reports ren et al 2015 wehbe et al 2009 doudrick et al 2013 it was found that fa could produce the carboxyl anion radicals co2 to reduce the nitrate during the photocatalytic process for the removal of dom fa has the photoinduced properties similar to acetylacetone zhang et al 2014 wu et al 2016 that can enhance the degradation of methyl orange dye via generating oh radicals wang et al wang and bai 2016 added fa to the methyl orange dye solution under the uv vis light irradiation and achieved as high as 81 8 of the mineralization rate in 1 5 h in this study we fabricated a uniform linbo3 coating layer on a polyethersulfone pes membrane via layer by layer self assembly and fa was applied to enhancing the redox between dom and nitrate during the concurrent filtration and photocatalysis to further evaluate the effect of fa on the synergy between dom and nitrate removal we assessed the molecular transformation of dom and nitrate during the concurrent filtration and photocatalysis considering the complexity of dom composition we applied fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms to determine the change of molecular formulas for dom based on these results the capability of the photocatalytic membrane for molecular degradation of dom and nitrate in the long term operation was evaluated and the mechanisms in simultaneous removal of dom and nitrate was discussed 2 materials

following a routine phase inversion method gohari et al 2013 park et al 1999 with pvp as a pore forming agent polyethersulfone pes and pvp were fully dissolved in nmp at a pes pvp nmp ratio of 18 4 78 the solution was then poured onto a glazed glass plate to form a 150 μm film using an automatic flat membrane casting machine the plate was then immersed quickly in deionized water for 15 min and the pes support formed when the film coagulated to stably coat the membrane surface with photocatalytic materials linbo3 preparation is detailed in si the pes support should be modified with polyelectrolytes first we sprayed the pes support with a fresh 200 mg dopamine solution with 100 ml of 10 mm tris hcl with a ph of 8 5 to facilitate self polymerization the dopamine on the pes support was then exposed to air after leaving the support for 8 h we filtered the resulting solution 100 ml of 100 mg l 1 linbo3 in 2 g l 1 pei under a vacuum at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min 1 onto the polydopamine pda coated pes the pei linbo3 coated pes that had been washed with di water was then soaked in a 2 g l 1 paa solution for 1 h the photocatalytic membrane was dried overnight at 25 c after being washed three times with ethyl alcohol 2 3 sampling and sample analysis effluent samples were obtained at different times of the day 6 am 2 pm and 10 pm from two different stps jiang xin zhou jx and cheng dong cd located in nanjing south east china these stps use two different biological treatment processes which were anaerobic oxic and anaerobic anoxic oxic membrane bioreactor respectively the jx stp has a treatment capacity of 640 000 m3 d 1 and serves 94 km2 of residential and commercial areas in and around the yuhuatai district the treatment capacity of the cd stp is 200 000 m3 d 1 and it serves 174 km2 in and around the qinhuai district fig 1 the samples of jx and cd stp were collected from the effluent of the secondary clarifier and membrane bioreactor respectively then the samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane to remove suspended solids and colloids before they were stored in brown glass bottles at 4 c and transported to the lab for treatment or analyses a toc analyser toc v cpn shimadzu was used to measure the dissolved organic carbon doc concentration of the effluents a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2401pc shimadzu was used to determine the optical properties of the dom such as the suva254 and e2 e3 values suva254 is the ratio of the absorbance of a sampling solution at 254 nm to its doc while e2 e3 is the specific value for absorbance at 250 and 365 nm weishaar et al 2003 ft icr ms solarix xr 7 0t bruker was used to determine the structure of dom the ms was operated for negative ion formation and the dom mass spectrum was collected in the mass range from m z 150 to 700 ion chromatography lc 10a shimadzu was applied to quantify the concentrations of no3 no2 and nh4 in the effluents total nitrogen was measured by alkaline potassium persulfate digestion uv spectrophotometric method the dissolved organic nitrogen is calculated by subtracting no3 n no2 n nh4 n from total nitrogen total dissolved solids were conducted by the evaporation weight of solution a zeta potentiometer zetasizer nano zs malvern was used to detect the zeta ξ potentials of the effluents each trial was conducted in triplicate and the average values of these were presented as the results 2 4 concurrent filtration and photocatalysis operations the effect of fa addition on the simultaneous removal of dom and nitrate was performed by concurrent filtration and photocatalysis abbreviated as cfp operations prior to the cfp operations the performance of adsorption and rejection on the photocatalytic membrane was evaluated besides the parameters of photocatalytic membrane was displayed in table 1 the membranes were placed on an ultrafiltration cup millipore 8400 emd millipore usa with a continuous flow of 20 l m 2 h 1 to filter the effluent samples in the absence of uv irradiation after 6 h of filtration the permeate solution was collected for analysing the nitrates and dom the cfp operation was implemented by a customised device fig 2 that was equipped with two uv lamps 40 w 365 nm philips usa a photocatalytic module a permeate tank and a pump the operation consists of several internal re circulations and the time for completing each re circulation is about 106min formic acid fa was added to the feed solution 500 ml at dosages of 0 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 mmol l 1 respectively air is piped into the photocatalytic module to create the trans membrane pressure and maintain the flux at 100 l m 2 h 1 as long as the feed solution and formic acid are added with the irradiation of uv light 0 92 mw cm 2 after the solution was completely filtered into the permeate tank 10 ml of the permeate solution was collected for analysis the solution was then recirculated back to the membrane module for the next cycle 2 5 long term operation for removing dom and nitrate to verify the long term performance of the photocatalytic membrane for dom and nitrate removal the system was operated for 28 days with moderate fa addition and fewer operation cycles which were based on the removal efficiency of cfp fresh feed solution 500 ml was injected into the membrane module by a pump after internal cfp recirculation ceased the permeate flux of the membrane module was maintained at 100 l m 2 h 1 and the initial trans membrane pressure tmp was 20 kpa membrane backwash was performed for 20 min using a naocl solution approximately 200 ppm available chlorine at 1 bar when the trans membrane pressure tmp exceeded 60 kpa 3 results and discussion 3 1 basic water quality parameters the water quality parameters of the samples collected from the cd and jx stps in july 2017 are presented in table 2 the tn and doc concentrations decreased throughout the treatment processes which were anaerobic oxic and anaerobic anoxic oxic membrane bioreactor for the jx and cd stp effluents respectively no3 n was the main nitrogenous pollutant in the effluent and constituted most of the tn the doc concentration in the sample from the cd stp was 13 97 mg l 1 which was lower than that in the sample from jx stp 19 21 mg l 1 the zeta potential of all the samples indicated a negative charge and the total dissolved solids tds in the samples from the cd and jx stps were 378 and 565 mg l 1 respectively 3 2 changes in nitrate during cfp operation at the absence of uv irradiation and formic acid the nitrate could not be adsorbed or rejected by the membrane while approximately 5 6 and 4 5 of the dissolved organic nitrogen don could be removed from the jx and cd stp samples respectively table s1 fig 3 a and b suggest that the fa could enhance the reduction of nitrate during the photocatalytic process there was a gradual decline in the tn of the sample solutions after cfp operation which was more apparent with a higher fa dosage when the fa dosage was increased to 2 mmol l 1 the no3 concentrations in the effluent from the jx and cd stps decreased to 1 11 and 1 24 mg l 1 respectively after the second cfp cycle furthermore the concentration of no2 decreased after an initial increase the change observed in the water samples from jx was particularly evident when the fa dosage increased after the first cfp cycle the reduction in don and the increase in nh4 were mild while no changes in their concentrations were observed during the subsequent cycles 3 3 changes in dom during cfp 3 3 1 changes in doc and residual fa fig 3c shows that the removal of doc from the sampling solution of the jx stp was significant at the higher fa dosage exceeding 1 5 mmol l 1 similar results were obtained for the cd stp sampling solution which was even more sensitive to fa dose fig 3d the doc increased slightly when a low dosage of fa was added to the feed after the fifth cfp the doc concentration in the jx stp sampling solution 2 0 mmol l 1 decreased from 19 21 to 4 1 mg l 1 while that in the cd stp samples decreased from 13 97 to 4 46 mg l 1 besides the dissolved oxygen concentration of sampling solution is maintained at the range of 6 1 6 6 mgl 1 23 c during the photocatalytic process detailed in table s4 the residual fa was reduced to 0 31 and 0 47 mg l 1 hcooh c in the filtered jx and cd solutions respectively while the filtration ph exceeded 6 4 table s2 when the fa dosage was 1 5 mmol l 1 as there is no specific discharge standard for fa from stps in china or other countries we assessed the environmental risks of fa according to the occupational exposure standard of 5 ppm set by the american occupational safety and health administration osha the residual fa levels in the filtered jx and cd solutions 1 19 and 1 8 ppm respectively were not expected to result in environmental risks towards humans furthermore fa naturally occurs in fruits and honey and it is easily oxidized into co2 and h2o in the natural environment thus the low residual fa level in the filtered solution should not negatively impact the aquatic environment 3 3 2 changes in optical properties during cfp the suva254 and e2 e3 values are pivotal optical properties of dom as they can reflect its aromaticity and composition massalha et al 2018 boyle et al 2009 the suva254 value is positively correlated with the aromaticity of dom while the e2 e3 value is negatively correlated with the molecular weight maizel and remucal 2017 fig 4 a and b displayed that the addition of fa during cfp operation could enhance the decrease of the aromaticity and molecular weight of dom and it could remove dom from the secondary jx stp effluent more efficiently throughout the internal cfp cycles the suva254 value of the two sampling filtrates decreased meanwhile after the fifth cfp with a fa dosage of 2 mmol l 1 the e2 e3 value gradually increased from 4 91 to 5 22 and 5 35 to 5 83 in the cd and jx stp effluents the suva254 value was higher in the secondary effluent of the cd stp than that of the jx stp while the e2 e3 value followed the opposite trend this could be due to differences between the treatment processes of the two stps the a2 o mbr process is used in the cd stp which may produce more microbially derived dom than the a o process used in the jx stp the higher aromaticity and molecular weight of the dom in the secondary effluent of the cd stp may indirectly determine its photodegradability this is consistent with the results presented in fig 4b the increase of the e2 e3 value was more apparent in the jx stp sampling solution than that in the cd stp furthermore during the initial cfp operation the addition of fa could contribute to the increase in suva254 the suva254 value of the jx stp filtrate was 1 48 l mg c 1 m 1 after the first cfp at a fa dosage of 0 5 mmol l 1 this was higher than that of the sampling solution without fa 1 36 l mg c 1 m 1 the results could be attributed to the fact that the non aromatic organics are preferentially degraded during photocatalysis in the low fa concentration 3 3 3 changes in the molecular composition of dom during cfp according to the results presented in figs 3 and 4 the removal of nitrate and doc was synergetic at a high fa dose to further elucidate the changes in the molecular composition of dom after the cfp operations with high strength fa esi ft icr ms measurements were taken to analyse the transformation of the molecules in dom we used the van krevelen diagrams of the water samples treated by five cfp cycles at a fa dosage of 1 5 mmol l 1 to explain the transformation of individual dom molecules according to previous reports mesfioui et al 2012 smith et al 2013 van krevelen diagrams can be composed of seven regions that correspond to different dom compositions to visualize the formulae of each water sample the boundaries of each region were established from the stoichiometric ranges such as the h c and o c values and were described in si the formulae that only contained cho chon and chos in dom are the most abundant occupying 40 7 46 3 17 5 21 2 and 23 7 26 4 of all the formulas assigned in the negative mode respectively table s3 as shown in fig 5 a and d the points representing the cho formulas in the raw jx and cd stp effluent were semblable and located in the protein carbohydrate lignin carboxylic rich alicyclic molecule cram like structure and tannin regions after cfp operation with the photocatalytic membrane the apparent transformations in the molecular compositions of the jx and cd stp effluent were captured the formulas removed from the two effluent samples were concentrated in the lignin cram like structure regions in which the o c value ranged from 0 1 to 0 5 however the formulas produced in the cd stp effluent were mainly scattered in the carbohydrate region with high o c and h c values of 0 7 1 0 and 1 5 2 0 respectively the points corresponding to the chon compounds were more dense in the jx stp sample than those in the cd stp sample fig 5b and e which is consistent with the data in table s3 the compounds removed from the two water samples were scattered in the low o c region 0 5 while the resistant compounds were distributed in the high o c region 0 6 furthermore the chon molecules produced contained more formulas in the lipid region o c 0 3 than the cho and chos molecules the changes in the molecular compositions of the chos formulae were similar to those of the cho formulas and more significantly the removed compounds exhibited an intense dispersal in regions with o c and h c values ranging from 0 3 to 0 6 and 1 0 to 1 6 respectively the van krevelen diagrams further indicate that during the cfp process the o c and h c values of dom in the stp effluent could be affected by the addition of fa which consumes oxygen deficient substances and produces oxygen rich substances some molecules with high h c 1 5 and low o c values 0 3 were produced in the chon formulas following cfp the functional group of these molecules is more likely to contain an amino group and a few aromatic structures to explain the variations in the dom molecules after the addition of fa we tested two parameters average carbon oxidation state osca and double bond equivalent dbe to evaluate the change in the degree of unsaturation in the composition of dom after five cfp operations at different fa dosages osca is the average carbon oxidation state which is defined as the charge a carbon atom would take if it were to lose all their electrons contained bonds with more electronegative atoms but gain all the electrons contained in bonds with less electronegative atoms kroll et al 2011 as the diversity in the atomic electronegativity follows the order o c h the presence of different bonds in molecules will contribute to diverse osc values the c o double bond such as that in carboxyl groups contributes 2 osc and the c o bond such as that in alcohol groups contributes 1 osc while c h bonds contribute 1 osc lv et al 2017a dbe is the double bond equivalent calculated as dbe c 1 2h 1 2n 1 stenson et al 2003 fig 6 shows the changes in the molecular weight m z osca value and dbe in the cho chon and chos compounds before and after cfp operation the proportion of 500 700 m z values in the cd stp secondary effluent was higher than that in the jx stp secondary effluent which is consistent with the e2 e3 values measured in the optical dom properties analysis the molecular weights of the two stp effluent samples decreased as the fa concentration increased and the m z values were mainly distributed within a range of 200 400 after the cfp after the addition of fa the osca values of all compounds were more positive and the average dbe value decreased besides compared to cho composition there were notable changes in the osca and dbe values of the chon and chos compositions based on the results of esi ft icr ms measurements it seems to be confirmed that fa exerts the photo induced effect on the oxidation of dom and the effect could be more easily to be achieved in the chon and chos composition of dom 3 4 removal efficiency of dom and nitrate during long term operation according to the cfp operation results the photocatalytic membrane could retain its effectiveness under the following conditions recirculating the solution to the membrane four times with 1 5 mmol l 1 of fa under such conditions only 1 34 and 2 1 mg l 1 of fa remained in the filtered solutions from the jx and cd stps respectively the system was operated for 28 days with a constant flux of 100 l m 2 h 1 resulting in a total of 92 operation cycles once an operation cycle end the fresh feed solution 500 ml will be injected into the membrane module for the next operation cycle each operation cycle will be experienced by 4 identical internal recirculation and its hydraulic retention time hrt was 7 h figs 7a and 6 b show the tmp profiles of the jx and cd stp effluents respectively during cfp for the secondary effluent from jx stp the membrane was backwashed five times the cleaning cycle of the first backwash was 162 5 h approximately 6 75 days while the final cycle was 115 h approximately 4 75 days the increase in tmp for the cd stp sample was more notable than that for the jx stp sample as six backwashes were required after each cleaning step the tmp could not return to its initial value of 20 kpa and was slightly higher than its previous value fig 7c and d illustrate the operational performances residual fa and the nitrate and dom removal efficiencies of cfp for the jx and cd stp effluents respectively the residual fa concentrations in the filtered solutions from the jx and cd stps were maintained at 1 5 and 2 2 mg l 1 respectively though there was a slight fluctuation in addition after the final backwashing the removal efficiencies of nitrate and dom from the jx stp sampling solution were maintained at 68 and 70 respectively whereas those of cd stp were approximately 85 and 60 3 5 the mechanisms in simultaneous removal of dom and nitrate based on aforementioned results we proposed the positive role of co2 in the photodecomposition of dom the mechanisms can be summarized in scheme 1 first the photocatalytic membrane is irradiated by uv light and then it will produce a mass of holes h on the membrane surface then hcoo can capture holes to produce the carboxyl anion radicals co2 and h in a low dosage of formic acid the carboxyl anion radicals is likely to be directly oxidized to co2 by nitrate while in a high one some carboxyl anion radicals may attack dom and result in a transition state meanwhile the transition state of dom can be oxidized to co2 or small molecules by nitrate in order to further verify the possibility of this pathway we changed some photocatalytic conditions for the simultaneous removal of dom and nitrate detailed in table 3 for example instead of air n2 was applied to provide a trans membrane pressure to drive the solution through the membrane during the photocatalytic process the solution was collected for electron spin resonance spectroscopy esr analysis with 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo besides after the process the remove efficiency of nitrate and dom for each trial were calculated as shown in table 3 the radical signal of co2 could be observed in the experimental groups of 1 and 2 while oh radicals were appeared in 6 that the solution was filtered by pes membrane with the addition of fa and under the irradiation of uv light the difference of radical signal verify the role of the photocatalytic membrane that provide h for fa to produce the co2 radicals besides as compared to other experimental groups 3 to 8 the 1 and 2 possess a significant removal efficiency for dom and nitrate these results suggest that formic acid generates co2 radicals via the photocatalytic membrane can be considered as a key stage in the photochemical process in addition the dom removal efficiency in the 3 was slight higher than the 4 which were 13 4 and 11 8 in the jx stp samples 18 1 and 17 9 in cd stp samples respectively the subtle differences of dom removal efficiency between the 3 and 4 indicate that h had negligible effects on nitrate to oxidize dom meanwhile the change of the gas that provide a trans membrane pressure causes an unconspicuous variation for removing dom which was conducted by the comparation of some experimental groups such 1 and 2 4 and 5 6 and 7 it means that the dissolved oxygen is difficult to oxidize dom during the photochemical process which is consistent with the slight change of dissolved oxygen in cfp operation detailed in table s4 according to the results in table 3 the proposed pathways could be used for interpreting the mechanisms in simultaneous removal of dom and nitrate in the previous reports on the photoreduction behavior of the carboxyl anion radicals wang and zhang 2011 tachikawa et al 2004 the co2 radicals can attack some organic matters such methyl viologen perchloroalkanes and perfluorooctanoic acid to produce the transition state of organic matters due to the complexity of the transition state for dom the esr spectra is failed to detect the radical signal from it besides the results of esi ft icr ms measurements suggested that chon and chos compositions of dom may be more easily to be removed by nitrate than that of cho compositions after they are attacked by co2 these however warrant a further investigation in the further 3 6 environmental implications fa enhanced photocatalytic membranes for the simultaneous removal of dom and nitrate provides a feasible approach to treating the secondary effluent of stps with the addition of moderate quantities of fa the redox between low strength nitrate and dom could be implemented meanwhile the residual fa should not negatively impact the aquatic environment 4 conclusions in this study we developed a photocatalytic membrane for simultaneous removal of dom and nitrate from the secondary effluents of sewage treatment plants the optical properties such suva254 and e2 e3 and results of ft icr ms analysis were compared molecular transformation in the secondary effluents from the jx and cd stps was related to the addition of fa for example oxygen deficient substances such as lignins and aromatic molecules were more likely to be consumed while lower molecular weight substances with lower dbe and more positive osc values were more likely to be produced long term cfp operation demonstrated that the membrane is durable and reusable in practical applications with the addition of moderate quantities of fa and lower hydraulic retention time the nitrate and dom removal efficiencies for the jx stp sample were maintained at 85 and 70 respectively while those of the cd stp sample were approximately 70 and 60 respectively the residual fa did not pose a significant environmental risk further efforts to enhance the performance of simultaneous dom and nitrate removal processes for sewage treatment plant effluents may be based on the application of photocatalytic materials such as linbo3 to membrane surfaces acknowledgements we gratefully

19428,graphene oxide go is a new type of nanomaterial with unique physicochemical properties and diverse applications whereas it poses potential risk to human and environment by screening from natural soil exposed to go in the laboratory we successfully obtained a novel bacterium labrys sp wjw which was able to use go as the sole carbon source for growth within 8 days cell numbers increased 16 76 3 21 folds using 100 mg l go as the carbon source by qpcr analysis the bacterial biodegradation which resulted in formation of holes and functional group changes of go was proved by raman spectroscopy atomic force microscopy transmission electron microscopy and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses aromatic intermediates with structures of benzoic acid and phenol were identified using gas chromatograph mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography time of flight mass spectrometry combination of genomic and proteomic analyses were performed to explore the proteins associated with go degradation a total of 644 proteins were significantly shifted bioinformatics analysis indicated that part of the up regulated proteins were related to oxidation ring cleavage and intermediates transmembrane processes and go was supposed to be degraded to benzoate and further degraded for downstream processes this study enriches our understanding and provides new insights into the environmental fate of go graphical abstract image 1 keywords graphene oxide biodegradation carbon source bacterium labrys sp proteomic 1 introduction graphene a single atomic plane of graphite geim and novoselov 2007 geim 2009 is considered as a revolutionary material within scientific community due to its unique physicochemical properties geim and novoselov 2007 lee et al 2008 zhu et al 2010a 2010b the chemical reduction of graphene oxide go is a promising route towards the commercial mass production of graphene in terms of high yield and low cost zhu et al 2010a 2010b chua and pumera 2014 as a graphene based material go has also captured great attention for sensors biomedical and environmental applications zhu et al 2010a 2010b chua and pumera 2014 perreault et al 2015 wan et al 2015 furthermore polymer nanocomposites with go showed significant increase in tensile strength liang et al 2009 and covalent functionalization of go were used to compatibilize the filler with polymer hosts stankovich et al 2006 with the extensive use of go more and more go byproducts will be released into environment in recent years the potential risks of go to human health and the environment have attracted great attention although the effects were controversial many evidences indicated that go was harmful to human health bianco 2013 apoptosis morphology change and oxidative stress of go were observed in vitro assessments vallabani et al 2011 liao et al 2011 lv et al 2012 sasidharan et al 2011 in vivo experiments showed that go had pulmonary toxicity oxidative stress and thrombotoxicity duch et al 2011 yang et al 2010 singh et al 2011 as for microbes it has been reported that different forms of go such as nanowalls nanosheets and go dispersions all showed antimicrobial activities against pathogens including escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus akhavan and ghaderi 2010 hu et al 2010 liu et al 2012 the key factors associated with the microbial toxicity of go were generation of oxygen reactive species adsorption of important biomolecules and physical toxicity in addition go showed toxic effects on microbial communities when released into waste water treatment plants and interactions between go and microbe significant affected the effectiveness of the depuration process ahmed and rodrigues 2013 though most of the graphene family nanomaterials would be end in the primary secondary sludge graphene oxide could even pass to the tertiary treatment process suárez iglesias et al 2013 given the potential risk of go it is important to develop remediation methods to alleviate its environmental impact biodegradation of carbon based nanomaterials is a feasible and effective approach four types of enzymes i e horseradish peroxidase hrp kotchey et al 2011 flores cervantes et al 2014 allen et al 2008 2009 russier et al 2011 zhao et al 2011 manganese peroxidase zhang et al 2014 neutrophil myeloperoxidase kagan et al 2010 and tartrate resistant acid phosphatase ramanathan et al 2016 have been reported to degrade pristine or functionalized carbon nanotubes as for go there are only two studies concerning the enzymatic degradation process kotchey et al 2011 reported the biodegradation of go by hrp in the presence of hydrogen peroxide electronic properties of go were altered after enzymatic treatment and the reduced form of holey go exhibited p type semiconducting property kurapati et al 2015 proved that human myeloperoxidase hmpo could metabolize highly dispersed go and the degree of oxidation was influenced by hydrophilicity negative surface charge and colloidal stability of go however when go enters environment it can be speculated that not enzymes but microorganisms in the various environmental matrices play a more critical role in transformation of go to the best of our knowledge there is only one study reporting graphite materials oxidation by a pseudomonas strain in the presence of naphthalene as the carbon source liu et al 2015 though go had a larger two dimensional size it shares similar structural characteristics with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs the degradation of pahs have been extensively studied and various strains can use pahs as the sole carbon source for growth kanaly and harayama 2000 das and mukherjee 2007 rafin et al 2000 genus of labrys was reported capable of degrading aromatic compounds such as ofloxacin norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin amorim et al 2014 therefore it can be inferred that some microorganisms can also degrade go and use it as the sole carbon source for growth but no such report is available as far as we know with the increasing usage and discharge of go products characterization and exploration of go degradation processes and mechanisms by bacterial strains are imperative to reveal its ecological effects in the present study a novel bacterial strain identified as labrys sp wjw was isolated from soil samples which could use commercial go as the sole carbon source for growth the biodegradation of go by strain wjw was demonstrated by raman spectroscopy atomic force microscopy transmission electron microscopy x ray photoelectron spectroscopy gas chromatograph mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography time of flight mass spectrometry combination of genomic and proteomic analyses were performed to explore and identify key enzymes for go degradation the regulated proteins were further analyzed by bioinformatics approaches to reveal possible biodegradation mechanism these findings should provide new insights and refine our understanding of go s environmental fate which could promote design and safe manner use of go products 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials graphene oxide go were purchased from nanjing xfnano

109 cfu ml the strain was enriched and collected from the mid exponential phase lb broth which was centrifuged and washed with phosphate buffer saline for three times before use 2 4 growth curve

characterization of graphene oxide prior to analyses go in samples were collected by centrifugation and heated to 60 c in the lauryl sodium sulphate solution to remove bacterial cells then the products were washed three times with ethanol and hydrochloric acid to remove salts zhang et al 2014 liu et al 2015 to analyze the biodegradation extent of go various analyses were performed raman spectra of the go were obtained by a dxr raman spectrometer thermo fisher scientific usa with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm for each sample 10 areas 1 μm2 were analyzed xps analysis thermo scientific k alpha was performed to analyze the change of chemical states using al kα hv 1486 6 ev as the excitation source the morphology changes of go were observed using tem tecnai t12 fei netherlands tecnai g220 s twin fei usa for each sample at least 10 areas were observed for quantification of the weights of residual go go of the whole flask was collected and bacterial cells were removed then the suspensions were washed three times using ddh2o and dried under 50 c the weight was measured using a xse105du balance with accuracy of 20 μg mettler toledo switzerland the raman spectra was used to insure few go in discarded supernatant no go signals 2 6 identification of intermediates the details of identification of intermediates are provided in supporting information text

http www omicsbean com 88 the multi omics data analysis tool was used to analyze the obtained proteomics data in which distributions in biological function cell component and molecular function were assigned to each protein based on gene ontology categories kegg pathway analysis was performed in order to identify enriched pathways which were induced by go exposure 2 12 accession number labrys sp wjw is deposited in china general microbiological culture collection center accession number cgmcc no 10702 the accession numbers of the 16s rrna gene sequence and whole genome shotgun project in genbank are kr778886 and lyxz00000000 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 isolation and identification of a go degrading strain wjw a bacterial strain designated as wjw was obtained from natural soil exposed to go in the laboratory which could use go as the sole carbon source for growth the strain was short rod with length of 1 0 μm in lb broth fig s1 colonies of strain wjw on solid plate of msm containing go were white circular and convex the 16s rrna gene sequence of strain wjw displayed high similarity with several labrys strains such as f11 99 and pcnb 21 99 amorim et al 2014 li et al 2011 carvalho et al 2008 moreira et al 2012 wong and huyop 2011 thus it could be identified as labrys sp wjw fig 1 a in addition strain wjw could also use various aromatic hydrocarbon compounds such as naphthalene phenanthrene pyrene and benzene a pyrene as the sole carbon source to grow table s1 see fig 2 3 2 growth curve of strain wjw to determine the growth curve of strain wjw using go as the sole carbon source qpcr total bacterial protein concentration and od660 were analyzed as shown in fig 1b cell numbers of strain wjw increased within the first 8 days which were 16 76 3 21 folds higher than the original inoculum then the cell numbers showed a slow decrease from day 8 to day 20 which could be attributed to accumulated metabolic wastes as for control group without go cell numbers continuously decreased during incubation day 8 0 45 0 06 folds day 20 0 21 0 04 folds the total bacterial protein concentrations were also determined to confirm the growth of strain wjw fig 1c showed total bacterial protein concentrations increased from 8 2 0 17 mg l to 12 34 0 65 mg l in 10 days and then decreased to 9 82 0 53 mg l at day 20 these results indicated that strain wjw could grow using go as the sole carbon source and reached the stationary phase at around 8 10 days after inoculation it was reported that go exhibited antibacterial activity against microbes at such dose akhavan and ghaderi 2010 hu et al 2010 liu et al 2012 thus the cell viability of strain wjw was analyzed by fluorescence based assay fig s2 aggregates of go were formed during incubation and strain cells grown with go exhibited a loss of viability the dead cells were mostly on the surfaces of go aggregates suggesting the direct contact with go was toxic to strain cells therefore the toxicity of go against strain wjw could be one of the reason that the cell numbers showed a decrease from day 8 to day 20 3 3 characterization of go biodegradation by strain wjw as evidenced from the growth curve data labrys sp wjw could use go as the sole carbon source for growth implying the biodegradation of go however many tertiary alcohols and epoxy functional groups were attached on the basal plane of go and the edge was decorated by keto carboxylic acid and 5 and 6 membered lactol groups lerf et al 1998 cai et al 2008 bai et al 2014 these attached carbon functional groups might provide carbon source for bacterial growth therefore transmission electron microscopy tem and atomic force microscopy afm were implemented to analyze the morphological changes of go samples of day 0 4 8 12 20 were collected and analyzed by tem at day 0 sheets of go were observed in a good dispersion with dimensions ranging from 0 4 to 6 3 μm since the ex situ method used in tem analysis the observation was based on randomly selected horizons of the samples after 4 days go sheets were attached by bacterial cells and began to collapse around the attachment sites visible holes were formed in the graphitic lattice of basal plane after 8 days incubation and hole size was continually expanded on day 12 and day 20 the multiple layer sheets of go were also observed during incubation e g tem image of day 12 it was attributed to the salts in medium which would promote aggregation of go sheets hong et al 2011 interestingly the formed holes on go were inhomogeneous some holes formed by strain wjw were large in size 1 μm and shaped as bacterial cell fig s3 while other holes were small in size similar with those obtained by enzymatic oxidation kotchey et al 2011 in addition the bacterial cells were observed forming biofilm instead of remaining free cells fig s4 in contrast go without bacterium was only wrinkle and basal plane structure was maintained after 20 days fig s5 go at day 0 and 20 were further examined by afm afm section analysis indicated that original go had a height of 1 0 1 2 nm fig s6 after 20 days incubation inhomogeneous holes were formed on go fig 4a and multi layer holes were observed with a height difference of 2 2 17 8 nm in particular the distance between holes d and the hole diameter d on day 20 were analyzed fig 4b the average diameter of holes 49 8 36 6 nm n 106 and average distance between holes 19 2 15 6 nm n 106 formed by strain wjw were much larger than those produced by hrp oxidation process 26 7 12 8 nm and 8 9 6 9 nm kotchey et al 2011 the large size of holes could be formed by the combination of small holes nearby during degradation lucchese et al 2010 zhong et al 2014 it was noticeable that large distance between holes d 57 5 nm 7 1 and big holes d 57 5 nm 28 3 were detected which was not found in hrp oxidation kotchey et al 2011 these results indicated an inhomogeneous degradation by strain wjw interestingly it was showed that large holes were formed around the edge of bacterial cells fig s7 in contrast go sheets maintained their integrity in abiotic control fig s8 therefore both afm and tem provided strong evidences that strain wjw produced holes on the basal plane of go during incubation raman spectroscopy was used to analyze go after incubation to define the morphological changes experimentally the peak at 1580 cm 1 which evaluates stretching of c c bonds in graphitic materials is so called g band and the presence of disorder in sp2 hybridized carbon systems give rise to the so called d band raman feature at 1350 cm 1 kotchey et al 2011 liu et al 2015 the ratio of the disorder induced d band to tangential g band an index of structural disorder of go were analyzed fig 3 c for go between day 0 and 8 the id ig ratio increased from 0 919 0 009 n 10 to 1 026 0 020 n 10 then the ratio continuously increased to 1 066 0 017 n 10 at day 20 significantly higher than the original go p 0 0001 student s t test meanwhile go sheets in abiotic control were in little variation 0 925 0 012 n 10 the increase of id ig ratio indicated an increase of defects on the surfaces of the go kotchey et al 2011 lucchese et al 2010 zhong et al 2014 while the increase of id ig ratio in this work was lower than hrp oxidation about 16 versus 45 and there were two plausible reasons for the variance except different characteristics of the two nanomaterials first the id ig ratio was related to average distance between defects the id ig ratio has a non monotonic dependence on d increasing with increasing d up to 4 nm and then decreasing for d 4 nm lucchese et al 2010 zhong et al 2014 cançado et al 2011 thus the inhomogeneous degradation as indicated from afm 19 2 15 6 nm versus 8 9 6 9 nm could be the main reason for the low change of id ig ratio second the id ig ratio was also influenced by the number of layers in reason of the large number of layers to be amorphized and or sputtered lucchese et al 2010 multi layer go after incubation as observed by tem and afm would result in no further increase of id ig ratio x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis was utilized to study the effects of strain wjw on the surface chemistry of go sheets the c 1s peaks of the go films before day 0 and after incubation day 20 with bacterium were shown in fig 3d four different peaks centered at 284 6 285 7 286 8 and 288 6 ev were observed corresponding to c c c c in aromatic rings c oh c in epoxy and alkoxy and c o groups respectively zhu et al 2010a 2010b the intensities of the carbon binding to oxygen peaks showed a significant change after incubation table s2 to compare the change of functional groups the peak area ratios of the c oh c in epoxy and alkoxy and c o groups to c c c c in aromatic rings were calculated the relative concentrations of functional groups at day 0 and day 20 were 2 16 and 0 96 indicating that go might be partially reduced during incubation akhavan and ghaderi 2012 however it was noted that the peak area of c epoxy and alkoxy was almost disappeared while the other three peak signals were increased at day 20 illustrating that strain wjw affected functional groups differently on go to test and quantify degradation extent the weights of residual go at day 0 and 20 were measured the degradation fraction was estimated as 30 89 6 43 after 20 days incubation as control go in abiotic group maintained as 94 76 4 22 currently quantitative studies of microbial degradation extent were limited liu et al 2015 reported a naphthalene degrading bacterium could form holes on go sheets through co metabolism with additional carbon source while there was no degradation extent data available for enzymatic oxidation it was reported the majority of go was completely oxidized in 20 days by tem observation but lack of quantitative data kotchey et al 2011 in the present study low density of bacterium caused by no extra carbon source addition and poor nutritional medium should be the main reason for the lower degradation extent compared with enzyme degradation but these harsh conditions were closer to the actual environment as for other carbon nanomaterials microbe was also reported to have ability in degradation you et al 2017 reported less than 1 of c and p mwcnt were mineralized by mycobacterium vanbaalenii pyr 1 within 25 days zhang et al 2013 reported mwcnt could be mineralize as much as 6 8 by a microbial community within 7 days through co metabolism 3 4 identification of the intermediates in go degradation to in depth investigate the metabolic mechanism of go biodegradation gas chromatograph mass spectrometer gc ms and liquid chromatography time of flight mass spectrometry lc tof ms were used to identify the intermediates the original go was analyzed before incubation fig s9 control group without go addition was also analyzed to ensure the intermediates fig s10 gc ms results demonstrated that intermediate products were formed by comparing chromatograms of day 0 and 18 fig s11 and the aromatic intermediates identified by gc ms were listed in table 1 mass spectra were shown in fig s12 several intermediates were aromatic compounds with structure of benzoic and phenol these aromatic intermediates were similar to those found during carboxylated swcnts degradation via hrp h2o2 allen et al 2009 and pahs biodegradation bamforth and singleton 2005 haritash and kaushik 2009 salicylic acid m z 137 0251 c7h6o3 h benzoic acid m z 121 0314 c7h6o2 h and phthalic acid m z 165 0199 c8h6o4 h which were common downstream intermediates of pahs bacterial biodegradation mrozik et al 2003 meulenberg et al 1997 were detected by lc tof ms fig s13 these intermediates were also identified when pahs phenanthrene pyrene and benzene a pyrene were incubated with strain wjw data not shown it has been reported that genus of labrys could degrade various aromatic compounds such as pentachloronitrobenzene li et al 2011 fluorobenzene carvalho et al 2008 difluorobenzenes moreira et al 2012 and fluoroquinolone antibiotics amorim et al 2014 amorim et al 2014 reported that labrys portucalensis f11 degraded substrates ofloxacin norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin through ring cleavage and displacement of substituent to form intermediates with less antibacterial potency in addition many other intermediates were also formed for instance two peaks which had m z 141 0168 and 389 2934 were observed after incubation in negative mode the presence of visible holes on basal plane of go and the intermediates in solution indicated that fragments and molecules were first flaked off from go and then further degraded the multiple intermediates detected by gc ms and lc tof ms illustrated the complexity of the bacterial degradation process 3 5 participation of bioactive substance in go degradation since the huge size of go comparing with bacterial cell prevented intracellular degradation extracellular processes such as catalysis by oxidative enzymes should play a key role in bacterial degradation of go therefore eps of strain wjw incubated with go were further analyzed fig s14 it was shown that free eps was significantly increased after strain inoculation the amount of free eps on day 1 reached the peak at 1100 mg l and then kept stable from day 3 to day 18 at 700 mg l the increased free eps could be caused by the contact of go and might have thereby protected strain wjw from go induced toxicity however the amount of bound eps was in a little variation from day 0 to day 18 in contrast the bound and free eps were continuously decreased in control group without go addition it could be noted that the ratio of protein in both free and bound eps increased during the incubation time which indicated the importance of protein during biodegradation to further illustrate biodegradation ability of strain wjw 50 mg l go was incubated with several systems as shown in fig s15 the morphological changes of go were different among group 2 6 by tem observation fig s16 visible holes on go were observed in group 2 4 and the holes formed by active cell extracts group 3 and group 4 were more homogeneous than that formed by bacterial cells group 2 in contrast go sheets in group 5 heat inactivated cell extracts and go and group 6 go only maintained basal plane integrity after 18 days the morphological changes were further analyzed by raman spectra experimentally after 18 days incubation the id ig ratios of group 2 6 changed from 0 919 0 009 to 1 088 0 011 1 042 0 003 1 054 0 013 0 936 0 010 0 922 0 011 n 10 respectively which illustrated group 2 4 had different degradation effects on go fig s17 consistently the degradation extents for group 2 4 by measuring the weights of residual go at day 0 and 20 were estimated as 50 89 10 43 20 89 7 17 26 52 9 78 respectively meanwhile go in group 5 and 6 were maintained as 93 88 3 33 and 95 26 4 96 these results illustrated that bacterial cells had better biodegradation capacity than active cell extracts it was also noted that degradation extent of group 2 was higher than the growth system as mentioned above suggesting the amount of bacteria and the concentration of go were the key factors for degradation in addition it can be inferred that the bioactive substances such as enzymes should participate the degradation process because of the degradation capability of active cell extracts 3 6 genomic sequencing of strain wjw the genomic dna of strain wjw was extracted and sequenced on illumina hiseq 2000 platform there were 7 6 mbp in total after treatment of the raw genome sequencing data a total of 7140 candidate protein coding sequences cdss and 499 subsystems were predicted by using the rapid annotations using subsystems technology rast annotation server accounting for 85 50 of the total sequences this is the first report of genome sequencing of genus labrys labrys was a novel genus and found to be different from other well known gram negative aromatic hydrocarbon degrader such as sphingomonas burkholderia comamonas and pseudomonas besides 127 genes were annotated for the metabolism of aromatic compounds in the genome and there were 227 cdss annotated for membrane transport which would partly explain its degradation ability towards go fig 4a further analysis indicated that there were several putative peroxidases such as dye decolorizing peroxidase non heme chloroperoxidase alkyl hydro peroxidase and cytochrome c peroxidase existing in the strain wjw 3 7 proteomic profiling of labrys sp wjw a proteomic analysis by comparing the treatment group go and glycerol as carbon source with the control group glycerol as carbon source was performed for identifying go induced functional genes a total of 3350 proteins were identified accounting for 49 71 of the genomic cdss in strain wjw indicating go posed significant effects on strain wjw after global normalization analysis 644 proteins were significantly shifted 2 fold changes of which 124 were up regulated and 520 were down regulated all the up regulated proteins were summarized in table s3 which were further analyzed using bioinformatics approaches to extract information relevant to involved pathways fig 4b showed an overview of up regulated proteins in biological process bp cell component cc and molecular function mf categories by gene ontology analysis in the bp analysis major up regulated proteins were classified into metabolic process gene ontology 0008152 and nucleobase containing compound biosynthetic process gene ontology 0034654 cc classification showed that most of these proteins were involved in intracellular gene ontology 0005622 macromolecular complex gene ontology 0032991 and protein complex gene ontology 0043234 processes 115 up regulated proteins were related with mf process and most of these proteins belonged to heterocyclic compound binding gene ontology 1901363 organic cyclic compound binding gene ontology 0097159 and ion binding gene ontology 0043167 heterocyclic compound binding and organic cyclic compound binding which demonstrated protein binding interacting selectively and non covalently with heterocyclic and organic cyclic compound were likely related to enzymatic attachment to go or intermediates it was noticed that oxidoreductase and hydrolase activities gene ontology 0016614 0016817 0016289 0016820 were also matched in mf classification these activities included oxidoreductase activity acting on ch oh ch ch ch ch2 aldehyde oxo group of donors gene ontology 0016614 0016635 0016627 0016726 0016620 hydrolase activity acting on acid anhydrides glycosyl and catalyzing transmembrane movement of substances gene ontology 0016817 0016820 0016798 as well as many transmembrane activities suggesting some of the up regulated proteins were related to oxidation ring cleavage and intermediates transmembrane processes biodegradation of go via hrp require enzymatic oxidation and carbon carbon bond cleavage of graphitic backbone kotchey et al 2011 2012 and similar enzymatic reactions were likely to occur in bacterial degradation process however some of the enriched activities such as metabolic and transmembrane process were also connected to the adaptions of go according to its toxicity the down regulated proteins were also analyzed fig s18 which illustrated that they were mainly classified into cc classification such as macromolecular complex gene ontology 0032991 and cytoplasm gene ontology 0005737 to further verify the metabolic roles of the 644 significantly shifted proteins the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg analysis were performed to reveal the active pathways fig s19 103 pathways were enriched which involved 499 proteins the pathways for benzoate degradation eco00362 naphthalene degradation eco00626 caprolactam degradation eco00930 and xylene degradation eco00622 were enriched naphthalene degradation xylene degradation and caprolactam degradation were all linked to benzoate degradation pathway the metabolites from benzoate degradation process could be used in a variety of other enriched pathways such as fatty acid metabolism and amino acid metabolism wang et al 2011 consistently pathways for fatty acid metabolism and biosynthesis eco01212 eco00061 eco01040 citrate cycle eco00020 pyruvate metabolism eco00620 butanoate metabolism eco00650 tyrosine phenylalanine metabolism eco00350 eco00360 and alanine aspartate glutamate metabolism eco00250 were more abundant in go treatment groups according to the kegg analysis benzoate degradation was the most connected pathway consistently aromatic intermediates with structure of benzoic acid were identified therefore go was supposed to be degraded to benzoate and then further degraded for downstream processes of the glycolysis citrate cycle pyruvate and butanoate metabolism we also found active pathways related to antibiotics and chemotaxis such as biosynthesis of antibiotics eco01130 and bacterial chemotaxis eco02030 which might be related to the bacterial adaption of go and biodegradation intermediates currently there were limited studies exploring interactions between carbon nanomaterials and microbe by omics techniques hu et al 2016 reported that go had toxic effects on single cell chlorella vulgaris and metabolomics showed that fatty acid biosynthesis could connect chlorophyll a and reactive oxygen species alterations induced by go another molecular level study of dna microarrays showed cnts could cause membrane damage and oxidative stress of e coli kang et al 2008 according to these reports enriched pathways for fatty acid biosynthesis and glycolysis in the present study might also be connected to the bacterial adaption of go induced toxicity considering the importance of oxidation in biodegradation of carbon nanomaterials we summarized the oxidoreductases lyases and hydrolases of up regulated proteins table 2 which might directly and indirectly contribute to the biodegradation of go oxidoreductases such as hrp kotchey et al 2011 flores cervantes et al 2014 allen et al 2008 2009 russier et al 2011 zhao et al 2011 manganese peroxidase zhang et al 2014 neutrophil myeloperoxidase kagan et al 2010 have been reported to play key roles in carbon nanomaterial degradation twelve annotated oxidoreductases including dioxygenase encoded by wjw3526 monooxygenase encoded by wjw1977 wjw6061 and dehydrogenase reductase encoded by wjw1487 wjw1867 wjw2351 wjw2579 wjw4875 wjw5808 wjw6878 were significantly up regulated in go treatment group dioxygenase and monooxygenase were the key enzymes to incorporate oxygen into the ring structure of unsubstituted saturated aromatic ring structure of pahs wilson and jones 1993 which might be responsible for go oxidation for instance α ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenase afk62887 71 similarity with wjw3526 were reported to initiate the degradation of each enantiomer of mecoprop nickel et al 1997 and phenoxyalkanoic acid herbicide 2 4 d fukumori and hausingerl 1993a 1993b wjw6061 was annotated as a component of methane monooxygenase which could oxidize a wide range of aromatic compounds such as benzene ethylbenzene toluene and styrene keener and arp 1994 hydrolases and lyases were also the key enzymes in organic substance degradation and they might catalyze the breaking of various chemical bonds on functional groups of go or degradation intermediates the broad substrate spectrum and abundant expression of these enzymes ensured their significance in go degradation and further study on gene cloning and expression were required to prove their functions 4 conclusions in this work a bacterial strain was screened from soil sample and could grow with go as the sole carbon source biodegradation of go by strain wjw resulted in defects on the basal plane and functional group changes intermediates were identified and some of them were aromatic compounds with structure of benzoic acid and phenol subsequently the combination of genomic and proteomic assays were conducted and a total of 644 proteins were significantly shifted 124 up regulated and 520 down regulated during go biodegradation further bioinformatics analyses illustrated that part of the up regulated proteins were related to oxidation ring cleavage and intermediates transmembrane some oxidoreductases lyases and hydrolases in up regulated proteins were supposed to play key roles in biodegradation while their detailed functions required further investigation with the increasing applications of go and their release into the environment bacterial biodegradation should be more attractive for go remediation due to its low cost and good environmental compatibility the mechanism of go biodegradation will provide guidance for material production and modification to maintain their structural stability for safer use acknowledgements this work was supported by the

19428,graphene oxide go is a new type of nanomaterial with unique physicochemical properties and diverse applications whereas it poses potential risk to human and environment by screening from natural soil exposed to go in the laboratory we successfully obtained a novel bacterium labrys sp wjw which was able to use go as the sole carbon source for growth within 8 days cell numbers increased 16 76 3 21 folds using 100 mg l go as the carbon source by qpcr analysis the bacterial biodegradation which resulted in formation of holes and functional group changes of go was proved by raman spectroscopy atomic force microscopy transmission electron microscopy and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses aromatic intermediates with structures of benzoic acid and phenol were identified using gas chromatograph mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography time of flight mass spectrometry combination of genomic and proteomic analyses were performed to explore the proteins associated with go degradation a total of 644 proteins were significantly shifted bioinformatics analysis indicated that part of the up regulated proteins were related to oxidation ring cleavage and intermediates transmembrane processes and go was supposed to be degraded to benzoate and further degraded for downstream processes this study enriches our understanding and provides new insights into the environmental fate of go graphical abstract image 1 keywords graphene oxide biodegradation carbon source bacterium labrys sp proteomic 1 introduction graphene a single atomic plane of graphite geim and novoselov 2007 geim 2009 is considered as a revolutionary material within scientific community due to its unique physicochemical properties geim and novoselov 2007 lee et al 2008 zhu et al 2010a 2010b the chemical reduction of graphene oxide go is a promising route towards the commercial mass production of graphene in terms of high yield and low cost zhu et al 2010a 2010b chua and pumera 2014 as a graphene based material go has also captured great attention for sensors biomedical and environmental applications zhu et al 2010a 2010b chua and pumera 2014 perreault et al 2015 wan et al 2015 furthermore polymer nanocomposites with go showed significant increase in tensile strength liang et al 2009 and covalent functionalization of go were used to compatibilize the filler with polymer hosts stankovich et al 2006 with the extensive use of go more and more go byproducts will be released into environment in recent years the potential risks of go to human health and the environment have attracted great attention although the effects were controversial many evidences indicated that go was harmful to human health bianco 2013 apoptosis morphology change and oxidative stress of go were observed in vitro assessments vallabani et al 2011 liao et al 2011 lv et al 2012 sasidharan et al 2011 in vivo experiments showed that go had pulmonary toxicity oxidative stress and thrombotoxicity duch et al 2011 yang et al 2010 singh et al 2011 as for microbes it has been reported that different forms of go such as nanowalls nanosheets and go dispersions all showed antimicrobial activities against pathogens including escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus akhavan and ghaderi 2010 hu et al 2010 liu et al 2012 the key factors associated with the microbial toxicity of go were generation of oxygen reactive species adsorption of important biomolecules and physical toxicity in addition go showed toxic effects on microbial communities when released into waste water treatment plants and interactions between go and microbe significant affected the effectiveness of the depuration process ahmed and rodrigues 2013 though most of the graphene family nanomaterials would be end in the primary secondary sludge graphene oxide could even pass to the tertiary treatment process suárez iglesias et al 2013 given the potential risk of go it is important to develop remediation methods to alleviate its environmental impact biodegradation of carbon based nanomaterials is a feasible and effective approach four types of enzymes i e horseradish peroxidase hrp kotchey et al 2011 flores cervantes et al 2014 allen et al 2008 2009 russier et al 2011 zhao et al 2011 manganese peroxidase zhang et al 2014 neutrophil myeloperoxidase kagan et al 2010 and tartrate resistant acid phosphatase ramanathan et al 2016 have been reported to degrade pristine or functionalized carbon nanotubes as for go there are only two studies concerning the enzymatic degradation process kotchey et al 2011 reported the biodegradation of go by hrp in the presence of hydrogen peroxide electronic properties of go were altered after enzymatic treatment and the reduced form of holey go exhibited p type semiconducting property kurapati et al 2015 proved that human myeloperoxidase hmpo could metabolize highly dispersed go and the degree of oxidation was influenced by hydrophilicity negative surface charge and colloidal stability of go however when go enters environment it can be speculated that not enzymes but microorganisms in the various environmental matrices play a more critical role in transformation of go to the best of our knowledge there is only one study reporting graphite materials oxidation by a pseudomonas strain in the presence of naphthalene as the carbon source liu et al 2015 though go had a larger two dimensional size it shares similar structural characteristics with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs the degradation of pahs have been extensively studied and various strains can use pahs as the sole carbon source for growth kanaly and harayama 2000 das and mukherjee 2007 rafin et al 2000 genus of labrys was reported capable of degrading aromatic compounds such as ofloxacin norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin amorim et al 2014 therefore it can be inferred that some microorganisms can also degrade go and use it as the sole carbon source for growth but no such report is available as far as we know with the increasing usage and discharge of go products characterization and exploration of go degradation processes and mechanisms by bacterial strains are imperative to reveal its ecological effects in the present study a novel bacterial strain identified as labrys sp wjw was isolated from soil samples which could use commercial go as the sole carbon source for growth the biodegradation of go by strain wjw was demonstrated by raman spectroscopy atomic force microscopy transmission electron microscopy x ray photoelectron spectroscopy gas chromatograph mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography time of flight mass spectrometry combination of genomic and proteomic analyses were performed to explore and identify key enzymes for go degradation the regulated proteins were further analyzed by bioinformatics approaches to reveal possible biodegradation mechanism these findings should provide new insights and refine our understanding of go s environmental fate which could promote design and safe manner use of go products 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials graphene oxide go were purchased from nanjing xfnano

109 cfu ml the strain was enriched and collected from the mid exponential phase lb broth which was centrifuged and washed with phosphate buffer saline for three times before use 2 4 growth curve

characterization of graphene oxide prior to analyses go in samples were collected by centrifugation and heated to 60 c in the lauryl sodium sulphate solution to remove bacterial cells then the products were washed three times with ethanol and hydrochloric acid to remove salts zhang et al 2014 liu et al 2015 to analyze the biodegradation extent of go various analyses were performed raman spectra of the go were obtained by a dxr raman spectrometer thermo fisher scientific usa with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm for each sample 10 areas 1 μm2 were analyzed xps analysis thermo scientific k alpha was performed to analyze the change of chemical states using al kα hv 1486 6 ev as the excitation source the morphology changes of go were observed using tem tecnai t12 fei netherlands tecnai g220 s twin fei usa for each sample at least 10 areas were observed for quantification of the weights of residual go go of the whole flask was collected and bacterial cells were removed then the suspensions were washed three times using ddh2o and dried under 50 c the weight was measured using a xse105du balance with accuracy of 20 μg mettler toledo switzerland the raman spectra was used to insure few go in discarded supernatant no go signals 2 6 identification of intermediates the details of identification of intermediates are provided in supporting information text

http www omicsbean com 88 the multi omics data analysis tool was used to analyze the obtained proteomics data in which distributions in biological function cell component and molecular function were assigned to each protein based on gene ontology categories kegg pathway analysis was performed in order to identify enriched pathways which were induced by go exposure 2 12 accession number labrys sp wjw is deposited in china general microbiological culture collection center accession number cgmcc no 10702 the accession numbers of the 16s rrna gene sequence and whole genome shotgun project in genbank are kr778886 and lyxz00000000 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 isolation and identification of a go degrading strain wjw a bacterial strain designated as wjw was obtained from natural soil exposed to go in the laboratory which could use go as the sole carbon source for growth the strain was short rod with length of 1 0 μm in lb broth fig s1 colonies of strain wjw on solid plate of msm containing go were white circular and convex the 16s rrna gene sequence of strain wjw displayed high similarity with several labrys strains such as f11 99 and pcnb 21 99 amorim et al 2014 li et al 2011 carvalho et al 2008 moreira et al 2012 wong and huyop 2011 thus it could be identified as labrys sp wjw fig 1 a in addition strain wjw could also use various aromatic hydrocarbon compounds such as naphthalene phenanthrene pyrene and benzene a pyrene as the sole carbon source to grow table s1 see fig 2 3 2 growth curve of strain wjw to determine the growth curve of strain wjw using go as the sole carbon source qpcr total bacterial protein concentration and od660 were analyzed as shown in fig 1b cell numbers of strain wjw increased within the first 8 days which were 16 76 3 21 folds higher than the original inoculum then the cell numbers showed a slow decrease from day 8 to day 20 which could be attributed to accumulated metabolic wastes as for control group without go cell numbers continuously decreased during incubation day 8 0 45 0 06 folds day 20 0 21 0 04 folds the total bacterial protein concentrations were also determined to confirm the growth of strain wjw fig 1c showed total bacterial protein concentrations increased from 8 2 0 17 mg l to 12 34 0 65 mg l in 10 days and then decreased to 9 82 0 53 mg l at day 20 these results indicated that strain wjw could grow using go as the sole carbon source and reached the stationary phase at around 8 10 days after inoculation it was reported that go exhibited antibacterial activity against microbes at such dose akhavan and ghaderi 2010 hu et al 2010 liu et al 2012 thus the cell viability of strain wjw was analyzed by fluorescence based assay fig s2 aggregates of go were formed during incubation and strain cells grown with go exhibited a loss of viability the dead cells were mostly on the surfaces of go aggregates suggesting the direct contact with go was toxic to strain cells therefore the toxicity of go against strain wjw could be one of the reason that the cell numbers showed a decrease from day 8 to day 20 3 3 characterization of go biodegradation by strain wjw as evidenced from the growth curve data labrys sp wjw could use go as the sole carbon source for growth implying the biodegradation of go however many tertiary alcohols and epoxy functional groups were attached on the basal plane of go and the edge was decorated by keto carboxylic acid and 5 and 6 membered lactol groups lerf et al 1998 cai et al 2008 bai et al 2014 these attached carbon functional groups might provide carbon source for bacterial growth therefore transmission electron microscopy tem and atomic force microscopy afm were implemented to analyze the morphological changes of go samples of day 0 4 8 12 20 were collected and analyzed by tem at day 0 sheets of go were observed in a good dispersion with dimensions ranging from 0 4 to 6 3 μm since the ex situ method used in tem analysis the observation was based on randomly selected horizons of the samples after 4 days go sheets were attached by bacterial cells and began to collapse around the attachment sites visible holes were formed in the graphitic lattice of basal plane after 8 days incubation and hole size was continually expanded on day 12 and day 20 the multiple layer sheets of go were also observed during incubation e g tem image of day 12 it was attributed to the salts in medium which would promote aggregation of go sheets hong et al 2011 interestingly the formed holes on go were inhomogeneous some holes formed by strain wjw were large in size 1 μm and shaped as bacterial cell fig s3 while other holes were small in size similar with those obtained by enzymatic oxidation kotchey et al 2011 in addition the bacterial cells were observed forming biofilm instead of remaining free cells fig s4 in contrast go without bacterium was only wrinkle and basal plane structure was maintained after 20 days fig s5 go at day 0 and 20 were further examined by afm afm section analysis indicated that original go had a height of 1 0 1 2 nm fig s6 after 20 days incubation inhomogeneous holes were formed on go fig 4a and multi layer holes were observed with a height difference of 2 2 17 8 nm in particular the distance between holes d and the hole diameter d on day 20 were analyzed fig 4b the average diameter of holes 49 8 36 6 nm n 106 and average distance between holes 19 2 15 6 nm n 106 formed by strain wjw were much larger than those produced by hrp oxidation process 26 7 12 8 nm and 8 9 6 9 nm kotchey et al 2011 the large size of holes could be formed by the combination of small holes nearby during degradation lucchese et al 2010 zhong et al 2014 it was noticeable that large distance between holes d 57 5 nm 7 1 and big holes d 57 5 nm 28 3 were detected which was not found in hrp oxidation kotchey et al 2011 these results indicated an inhomogeneous degradation by strain wjw interestingly it was showed that large holes were formed around the edge of bacterial cells fig s7 in contrast go sheets maintained their integrity in abiotic control fig s8 therefore both afm and tem provided strong evidences that strain wjw produced holes on the basal plane of go during incubation raman spectroscopy was used to analyze go after incubation to define the morphological changes experimentally the peak at 1580 cm 1 which evaluates stretching of c c bonds in graphitic materials is so called g band and the presence of disorder in sp2 hybridized carbon systems give rise to the so called d band raman feature at 1350 cm 1 kotchey et al 2011 liu et al 2015 the ratio of the disorder induced d band to tangential g band an index of structural disorder of go were analyzed fig 3 c for go between day 0 and 8 the id ig ratio increased from 0 919 0 009 n 10 to 1 026 0 020 n 10 then the ratio continuously increased to 1 066 0 017 n 10 at day 20 significantly higher than the original go p 0 0001 student s t test meanwhile go sheets in abiotic control were in little variation 0 925 0 012 n 10 the increase of id ig ratio indicated an increase of defects on the surfaces of the go kotchey et al 2011 lucchese et al 2010 zhong et al 2014 while the increase of id ig ratio in this work was lower than hrp oxidation about 16 versus 45 and there were two plausible reasons for the variance except different characteristics of the two nanomaterials first the id ig ratio was related to average distance between defects the id ig ratio has a non monotonic dependence on d increasing with increasing d up to 4 nm and then decreasing for d 4 nm lucchese et al 2010 zhong et al 2014 cançado et al 2011 thus the inhomogeneous degradation as indicated from afm 19 2 15 6 nm versus 8 9 6 9 nm could be the main reason for the low change of id ig ratio second the id ig ratio was also influenced by the number of layers in reason of the large number of layers to be amorphized and or sputtered lucchese et al 2010 multi layer go after incubation as observed by tem and afm would result in no further increase of id ig ratio x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis was utilized to study the effects of strain wjw on the surface chemistry of go sheets the c 1s peaks of the go films before day 0 and after incubation day 20 with bacterium were shown in fig 3d four different peaks centered at 284 6 285 7 286 8 and 288 6 ev were observed corresponding to c c c c in aromatic rings c oh c in epoxy and alkoxy and c o groups respectively zhu et al 2010a 2010b the intensities of the carbon binding to oxygen peaks showed a significant change after incubation table s2 to compare the change of functional groups the peak area ratios of the c oh c in epoxy and alkoxy and c o groups to c c c c in aromatic rings were calculated the relative concentrations of functional groups at day 0 and day 20 were 2 16 and 0 96 indicating that go might be partially reduced during incubation akhavan and ghaderi 2012 however it was noted that the peak area of c epoxy and alkoxy was almost disappeared while the other three peak signals were increased at day 20 illustrating that strain wjw affected functional groups differently on go to test and quantify degradation extent the weights of residual go at day 0 and 20 were measured the degradation fraction was estimated as 30 89 6 43 after 20 days incubation as control go in abiotic group maintained as 94 76 4 22 currently quantitative studies of microbial degradation extent were limited liu et al 2015 reported a naphthalene degrading bacterium could form holes on go sheets through co metabolism with additional carbon source while there was no degradation extent data available for enzymatic oxidation it was reported the majority of go was completely oxidized in 20 days by tem observation but lack of quantitative data kotchey et al 2011 in the present study low density of bacterium caused by no extra carbon source addition and poor nutritional medium should be the main reason for the lower degradation extent compared with enzyme degradation but these harsh conditions were closer to the actual environment as for other carbon nanomaterials microbe was also reported to have ability in degradation you et al 2017 reported less than 1 of c and p mwcnt were mineralized by mycobacterium vanbaalenii pyr 1 within 25 days zhang et al 2013 reported mwcnt could be mineralize as much as 6 8 by a microbial community within 7 days through co metabolism 3 4 identification of the intermediates in go degradation to in depth investigate the metabolic mechanism of go biodegradation gas chromatograph mass spectrometer gc ms and liquid chromatography time of flight mass spectrometry lc tof ms were used to identify the intermediates the original go was analyzed before incubation fig s9 control group without go addition was also analyzed to ensure the intermediates fig s10 gc ms results demonstrated that intermediate products were formed by comparing chromatograms of day 0 and 18 fig s11 and the aromatic intermediates identified by gc ms were listed in table 1 mass spectra were shown in fig s12 several intermediates were aromatic compounds with structure of benzoic and phenol these aromatic intermediates were similar to those found during carboxylated swcnts degradation via hrp h2o2 allen et al 2009 and pahs biodegradation bamforth and singleton 2005 haritash and kaushik 2009 salicylic acid m z 137 0251 c7h6o3 h benzoic acid m z 121 0314 c7h6o2 h and phthalic acid m z 165 0199 c8h6o4 h which were common downstream intermediates of pahs bacterial biodegradation mrozik et al 2003 meulenberg et al 1997 were detected by lc tof ms fig s13 these intermediates were also identified when pahs phenanthrene pyrene and benzene a pyrene were incubated with strain wjw data not shown it has been reported that genus of labrys could degrade various aromatic compounds such as pentachloronitrobenzene li et al 2011 fluorobenzene carvalho et al 2008 difluorobenzenes moreira et al 2012 and fluoroquinolone antibiotics amorim et al 2014 amorim et al 2014 reported that labrys portucalensis f11 degraded substrates ofloxacin norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin through ring cleavage and displacement of substituent to form intermediates with less antibacterial potency in addition many other intermediates were also formed for instance two peaks which had m z 141 0168 and 389 2934 were observed after incubation in negative mode the presence of visible holes on basal plane of go and the intermediates in solution indicated that fragments and molecules were first flaked off from go and then further degraded the multiple intermediates detected by gc ms and lc tof ms illustrated the complexity of the bacterial degradation process 3 5 participation of bioactive substance in go degradation since the huge size of go comparing with bacterial cell prevented intracellular degradation extracellular processes such as catalysis by oxidative enzymes should play a key role in bacterial degradation of go therefore eps of strain wjw incubated with go were further analyzed fig s14 it was shown that free eps was significantly increased after strain inoculation the amount of free eps on day 1 reached the peak at 1100 mg l and then kept stable from day 3 to day 18 at 700 mg l the increased free eps could be caused by the contact of go and might have thereby protected strain wjw from go induced toxicity however the amount of bound eps was in a little variation from day 0 to day 18 in contrast the bound and free eps were continuously decreased in control group without go addition it could be noted that the ratio of protein in both free and bound eps increased during the incubation time which indicated the importance of protein during biodegradation to further illustrate biodegradation ability of strain wjw 50 mg l go was incubated with several systems as shown in fig s15 the morphological changes of go were different among group 2 6 by tem observation fig s16 visible holes on go were observed in group 2 4 and the holes formed by active cell extracts group 3 and group 4 were more homogeneous than that formed by bacterial cells group 2 in contrast go sheets in group 5 heat inactivated cell extracts and go and group 6 go only maintained basal plane integrity after 18 days the morphological changes were further analyzed by raman spectra experimentally after 18 days incubation the id ig ratios of group 2 6 changed from 0 919 0 009 to 1 088 0 011 1 042 0 003 1 054 0 013 0 936 0 010 0 922 0 011 n 10 respectively which illustrated group 2 4 had different degradation effects on go fig s17 consistently the degradation extents for group 2 4 by measuring the weights of residual go at day 0 and 20 were estimated as 50 89 10 43 20 89 7 17 26 52 9 78 respectively meanwhile go in group 5 and 6 were maintained as 93 88 3 33 and 95 26 4 96 these results illustrated that bacterial cells had better biodegradation capacity than active cell extracts it was also noted that degradation extent of group 2 was higher than the growth system as mentioned above suggesting the amount of bacteria and the concentration of go were the key factors for degradation in addition it can be inferred that the bioactive substances such as enzymes should participate the degradation process because of the degradation capability of active cell extracts 3 6 genomic sequencing of strain wjw the genomic dna of strain wjw was extracted and sequenced on illumina hiseq 2000 platform there were 7 6 mbp in total after treatment of the raw genome sequencing data a total of 7140 candidate protein coding sequences cdss and 499 subsystems were predicted by using the rapid annotations using subsystems technology rast annotation server accounting for 85 50 of the total sequences this is the first report of genome sequencing of genus labrys labrys was a novel genus and found to be different from other well known gram negative aromatic hydrocarbon degrader such as sphingomonas burkholderia comamonas and pseudomonas besides 127 genes were annotated for the metabolism of aromatic compounds in the genome and there were 227 cdss annotated for membrane transport which would partly explain its degradation ability towards go fig 4a further analysis indicated that there were several putative peroxidases such as dye decolorizing peroxidase non heme chloroperoxidase alkyl hydro peroxidase and cytochrome c peroxidase existing in the strain wjw 3 7 proteomic profiling of labrys sp wjw a proteomic analysis by comparing the treatment group go and glycerol as carbon source with the control group glycerol as carbon source was performed for identifying go induced functional genes a total of 3350 proteins were identified accounting for 49 71 of the genomic cdss in strain wjw indicating go posed significant effects on strain wjw after global normalization analysis 644 proteins were significantly shifted 2 fold changes of which 124 were up regulated and 520 were down regulated all the up regulated proteins were summarized in table s3 which were further analyzed using bioinformatics approaches to extract information relevant to involved pathways fig 4b showed an overview of up regulated proteins in biological process bp cell component cc and molecular function mf categories by gene ontology analysis in the bp analysis major up regulated proteins were classified into metabolic process gene ontology 0008152 and nucleobase containing compound biosynthetic process gene ontology 0034654 cc classification showed that most of these proteins were involved in intracellular gene ontology 0005622 macromolecular complex gene ontology 0032991 and protein complex gene ontology 0043234 processes 115 up regulated proteins were related with mf process and most of these proteins belonged to heterocyclic compound binding gene ontology 1901363 organic cyclic compound binding gene ontology 0097159 and ion binding gene ontology 0043167 heterocyclic compound binding and organic cyclic compound binding which demonstrated protein binding interacting selectively and non covalently with heterocyclic and organic cyclic compound were likely related to enzymatic attachment to go or intermediates it was noticed that oxidoreductase and hydrolase activities gene ontology 0016614 0016817 0016289 0016820 were also matched in mf classification these activities included oxidoreductase activity acting on ch oh ch ch ch ch2 aldehyde oxo group of donors gene ontology 0016614 0016635 0016627 0016726 0016620 hydrolase activity acting on acid anhydrides glycosyl and catalyzing transmembrane movement of substances gene ontology 0016817 0016820 0016798 as well as many transmembrane activities suggesting some of the up regulated proteins were related to oxidation ring cleavage and intermediates transmembrane processes biodegradation of go via hrp require enzymatic oxidation and carbon carbon bond cleavage of graphitic backbone kotchey et al 2011 2012 and similar enzymatic reactions were likely to occur in bacterial degradation process however some of the enriched activities such as metabolic and transmembrane process were also connected to the adaptions of go according to its toxicity the down regulated proteins were also analyzed fig s18 which illustrated that they were mainly classified into cc classification such as macromolecular complex gene ontology 0032991 and cytoplasm gene ontology 0005737 to further verify the metabolic roles of the 644 significantly shifted proteins the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg analysis were performed to reveal the active pathways fig s19 103 pathways were enriched which involved 499 proteins the pathways for benzoate degradation eco00362 naphthalene degradation eco00626 caprolactam degradation eco00930 and xylene degradation eco00622 were enriched naphthalene degradation xylene degradation and caprolactam degradation were all linked to benzoate degradation pathway the metabolites from benzoate degradation process could be used in a variety of other enriched pathways such as fatty acid metabolism and amino acid metabolism wang et al 2011 consistently pathways for fatty acid metabolism and biosynthesis eco01212 eco00061 eco01040 citrate cycle eco00020 pyruvate metabolism eco00620 butanoate metabolism eco00650 tyrosine phenylalanine metabolism eco00350 eco00360 and alanine aspartate glutamate metabolism eco00250 were more abundant in go treatment groups according to the kegg analysis benzoate degradation was the most connected pathway consistently aromatic intermediates with structure of benzoic acid were identified therefore go was supposed to be degraded to benzoate and then further degraded for downstream processes of the glycolysis citrate cycle pyruvate and butanoate metabolism we also found active pathways related to antibiotics and chemotaxis such as biosynthesis of antibiotics eco01130 and bacterial chemotaxis eco02030 which might be related to the bacterial adaption of go and biodegradation intermediates currently there were limited studies exploring interactions between carbon nanomaterials and microbe by omics techniques hu et al 2016 reported that go had toxic effects on single cell chlorella vulgaris and metabolomics showed that fatty acid biosynthesis could connect chlorophyll a and reactive oxygen species alterations induced by go another molecular level study of dna microarrays showed cnts could cause membrane damage and oxidative stress of e coli kang et al 2008 according to these reports enriched pathways for fatty acid biosynthesis and glycolysis in the present study might also be connected to the bacterial adaption of go induced toxicity considering the importance of oxidation in biodegradation of carbon nanomaterials we summarized the oxidoreductases lyases and hydrolases of up regulated proteins table 2 which might directly and indirectly contribute to the biodegradation of go oxidoreductases such as hrp kotchey et al 2011 flores cervantes et al 2014 allen et al 2008 2009 russier et al 2011 zhao et al 2011 manganese peroxidase zhang et al 2014 neutrophil myeloperoxidase kagan et al 2010 have been reported to play key roles in carbon nanomaterial degradation twelve annotated oxidoreductases including dioxygenase encoded by wjw3526 monooxygenase encoded by wjw1977 wjw6061 and dehydrogenase reductase encoded by wjw1487 wjw1867 wjw2351 wjw2579 wjw4875 wjw5808 wjw6878 were significantly up regulated in go treatment group dioxygenase and monooxygenase were the key enzymes to incorporate oxygen into the ring structure of unsubstituted saturated aromatic ring structure of pahs wilson and jones 1993 which might be responsible for go oxidation for instance α ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenase afk62887 71 similarity with wjw3526 were reported to initiate the degradation of each enantiomer of mecoprop nickel et al 1997 and phenoxyalkanoic acid herbicide 2 4 d fukumori and hausingerl 1993a 1993b wjw6061 was annotated as a component of methane monooxygenase which could oxidize a wide range of aromatic compounds such as benzene ethylbenzene toluene and styrene keener and arp 1994 hydrolases and lyases were also the key enzymes in organic substance degradation and they might catalyze the breaking of various chemical bonds on functional groups of go or degradation intermediates the broad substrate spectrum and abundant expression of these enzymes ensured their significance in go degradation and further study on gene cloning and expression were required to prove their functions 4 conclusions in this work a bacterial strain was screened from soil sample and could grow with go as the sole carbon source biodegradation of go by strain wjw resulted in defects on the basal plane and functional group changes intermediates were identified and some of them were aromatic compounds with structure of benzoic acid and phenol subsequently the combination of genomic and proteomic assays were conducted and a total of 644 proteins were significantly shifted 124 up regulated and 520 down regulated during go biodegradation further bioinformatics analyses illustrated that part of the up regulated proteins were related to oxidation ring cleavage and intermediates transmembrane some oxidoreductases lyases and hydrolases in up regulated proteins were supposed to play key roles in biodegradation while their detailed functions required further investigation with the increasing applications of go and their release into the environment bacterial biodegradation should be more attractive for go remediation due to its low cost and good environmental compatibility the mechanism of go biodegradation will provide guidance for material production and modification to maintain their structural stability for safer use acknowledgements this work was supported by the

19429,treatment of sewage sludge with a thermal hydrolysis process thp followed by anaerobic digestion ad enables to boost biogas production and minimize residual sludge volumes however the reject water can cause inhibition to aerobic and anoxic ammonium oxidizing bacteria aeraob anaob the two key microbial groups involved in the deammonification process firstly a detailed investigation elucidated the impact of different organic fractions present in thp ad return liquor on aeraob and anaob activity for anaob soluble compounds linked to thp conditions and ad performance caused the main inhibition direct inhibition by dissolved organics was also observed for aeraob but could be overcome by treating the filtrate with extended aerobic or anaerobic incubation or with activated carbon aeraob additionally suffered from particulate and colloidal organics limiting the diffusion of substrates this was resolved by improving the dewatering process through an optimized flocculant polymer dose and or addition of coagulant polymer to better capture the large colloidal fraction especially in case of unstable ad performance secondly a new inhibition model for aeraob included diffusion limiting compounds based on the porter equation and achieved the best fit with the experimental data highlighting that aeraob were highly sensitive to large colloids overall this paper for the first time provides separate identification of organic fractions within thp ad filtrate causing differential types of inhibition moreover it highlights the combined effect of the performance of thp ad and dewatering on the downstream autotrophic nitrogen removal kinetics graphical abstract image 1 keywords biological nutrient removal partial nitrification anammox water resources recovery facility 1 introduction thermal hydrolysis processes thp are well established as reliable and energy efficient ways to intensify solids handling in sewage treatment by creating a change in the rheology of the waste sludge which allows for increased loading rates resulting in smaller digester volumes barber 2016 in addition this technology lowers the bound water fraction in sludge thus resulting in an increased cake solids concentration after dewatering irrespective of dewatering equipment bader 1978 jolis 2008 pickworth et al 2006 the combination of thp and anaerobic digestion ad has been applied worldwide e g at hias wastewater treatment plant wwtp hamar norway hengelo wwtp hengelo the netherlands oxley creek water reclamation plant australia and blue plains advanced wwtp dc water washington dc usa dwyer et al 2008 pickworth et al 2006 the rapid decompression due to releasing steam reduces the sludge particle size by 40 50 while higher levels of colloidal and particulate organics were observed in the returned liquor compared to the returned liquor from conventional ad barber 2016 bougrier et al 2008 feng et al 2014 haug 1978 zhang et al 2016 this can potentially be resolved by adding coagulants which enhance the capture of fine solids or by allowing for enhanced flocculation under optimized combinations of shear and exposure time niu et al 2013 poon and chu 1999 deammonification or partial nitritation anammox is well established as resource efficient nitrogen removal process with 100 full scale applications and is particularly suitable to treat dewatering liquor from sludge ad lackner et al 2014 most observed limitations in performance have been associated with aerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria aeraob due to sensitivity towards organics substances micronutrient limitation or free ammonia inhibition gujer 2010 sinha and annachhatre 2006 limitations on anoxic ammonium oxidizing or anammox bacteria anaob because of similar factors are mostly compensated by efficient and enhanced retention of anaob creating a larger buffer in anaob biomass han et al 2016 in recent years the application of deammonification has stepwise been expanded to treat livestock wastewater diluted landfill leachate and thp digestate all these types of wastewater contain a wider range of inorganic and organic compounds compared to conventional sewage sludge ad effluent with reported challenges for efficient and stable deammonifaction treatment dapena mora et al 2006 ganigué et al 2008 kindaichi et al 2016 lotti et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 for thp cell lysis under the high temperatures yields ad filtrate higher in organic compounds concentration barber 2016 which has shown to be partially inhibitory towards aeraob and anaob figdore et al 2011 challenging efficient n removal chan 2015 zhang et al 2016 when comparing deammonification treatment of conventional ad filtrate with treatment of thp ad filtrate in two long term reactors decreased aeraob rates were observed when treating thp ad filtrate potentially caused by increased level of organics present in thp ad filtrate zhang et al 2016 optimization of key control parameters enabled efficient treatment including increased dissolved oxygen do set point 1 mg o2 l longer aeration times and selective anaob retention through screens zhang et al 2016 when ad instability yielded increased digestate concentrations of volatile fatty acids and other organics these soluble and colloidal compounds decreased the deammonification performance considerably zhang et al 2016 the link between thp and creation of inhibitory compounds was also observed at full scale with the performance of sidestream deammonification decreasing after upstream implementation of thp chan 2015 however to the best of our knowledge no specific inhibitory factors have yet been identified within thp ad filtrate nor have the inhibition mechanisms for aeraob and anaob been unraveled monod microbial growth kinetics are the simplest and most popular rate expression assuming that every single essential substrate is a growth limiting factor beg and hassan 1987 han and levenspiel 1988 to include inhibition related limitations in growth rate monod type models were further developed based on three ways of inhibition han and levenspiel 1988 i competitive inhibition yielding an increased substrate affinity constant ks but not affecting the maximum specific growth rate μmax ii non competitive inhibition lowering μmax but not impacting ks and iii uncompetitive inhibition combining aspects of non competitive and competitive inhibition i e affecting both ks and μmax interestingly recent work of shaw et al 2015 has shown that ks is not a constant but the maximum rate and diffusion influence this parameter with a relationship established based on a linear data fit and the porter diffusion model this concept was shown to be widely applicable as shown by fits for denitrification biofilm and floc nitrification and anaerobic digestion shaw et al 2015 summarizing inhibitors can be described as i direct causing decreased microbial growth rates hereby assuming inhibitors do not influence the diffusion to the cells i e non competitive inhibition by using an inverted monod factor of the so called direct inhibitor and ii diffusional indirect limiting diffusion represented by an increased ks value i e competitive inhibition through including the porter equation on the affinities for substrate and direct inhibitors in the case of thp ad filtrate diffusion limitation on aeraob containing flocs caused by the increased particulate and colloidal fractions was suggested to be responsible for decreased ammonium conversion rates zhang et al 2016 inclusion of this mechanism in a model is hypothesized to improve the predictability of deammonification performance the first objective of this study was to identify the short term inhibition effects and mechanisms exerted by the soluble colloidal and particulate organics in thp ad filtrate on aeraob and anaob activities hereto batch experiments were performed using non acclimated deammonification sludge tests related to examining whether inhibition was linked to 1 quality of the thp ad filtrate 2 additional pretreatment options 3 performance of the dewatering stage flocculant coagulant polymer dose the second objective was to develop and evaluate a microbial kinetic model identifying specific contributions of organic fractions to either direct or diffusional limitations in conversion activities both for aeraob and anaob 2 materials and methods 2 1 thp ad reactors anaerobic sludge for dewatering was obtained from two types of ad systems firstly a semi technical scale 60 l reactor was used fed with thermally hydrolyzed sludge at 165 c 30 min dc water washington dc usa this digester was stably operated at 15 days solids retention time srt with a feed total solids ts concentration of about 10 5 yielding 50 volatile solids vs reduction at 38 5 1 c secondly one of the four full scale anaerobic digesters was sampled which was started up in october 2014 with an increasing feed loading from the same thp process the digesters were operated around 20 days srt at 38 c fed with 9 5 ts with 70 vs reduction 2 2 sludge dewatering filtrate production the ad sludge was dewatered including rapid mixing flocculation and belt press shear followed by gravity drainage through a belt filter cloth the remaining solids were mechanically dewatered using a centrifuge at 3000 g for 10 min higgins et al 2014 flopam 4440 snf ga usa a polyelectrolyte with a very high molecular weight and median cationic charge 35 was used as flocculation polymer the optimal polymer dose opd was determined based on filtrate quality by establishing a polymer dosing response curve which varies depending on the digester operation conditions 2 3 description of filtrate applied in the tests 2 3 1 filtrate quality at digester stability and unstability the lab scale digester was stably operated for two years to compare to the full scale digesters zhang et al 2016 for the full scale digesters representative samples were obtained for unstable and stable behavior the unstable full scale ad refers to inconsistent loading and inadequate mixing in the digester one month after reaching its full loading rate during this event the digesters experienced foaming increased volatile fatty acids vfa concentrations and decreased ph alkalinity specific gravity and biogas methane content four months after the digesters recovered from the unstable period mentioned above another sludge sample was taken and underwent the same inhibition activity tests referred to in this study as stable full scale ad 2 3 2 filtrate pretreatment procedures five procedures were tested to remove specific classes of inhibiting components prior to the activity tests first micronutrient addition in the filtrate was tested to check the growth limitation secondly the effect of biodegradable compounds was examined a one day aerobic treatment was executed aerating the full scale filtrate for one day in the presence of nitrifying activated sludge 3 4 g tss l aiming to remove vfa and some other readily biodegradable organics then long term aerobic and anaerobic treatment were performed to remove biodegradable cod bcod in the aerobic pretreatment the full scale filtrate was aerated at a dissolved oxygen do level above 4 0 mg o2 l for seven days after addition of nitrifying activated sludge 3 4 g tss l until no decrease in soluble cod was observed for the last four days in the anaerobic pretreatment sludge was derived from biochemical methane potential tests until only refractory cod remained in the sludge after twelve days inoculation stuckey and mccarty 1984 thirdly precipitation with fe3 and zn2 was tested iron iii sulfate 1 g fe l or zinc sulfate 1 g zn l was added under ph control after which precipitates were removed by centrifugation 10 000 g 10 min fourthly filtrate was added to hexane as extraction solvent on 1 2 vol basis followed by shaking and re separation in a separatory funnel finally adsorption to activated carbon was investigated by adding biochar pa usa and granular activated carbon donau chemie austria to the filtrate stirring the mixture for 30 min and removing with centrifugation 10 000 g 10 min 2 3 3 addition of fecl3 and polydadmac as coagulants two conditioning processes were used to alter the cod fractions in the filtrate composition i e flocculation and coagulation flocculation as coagulants fecl3 and polydadmac were injected before the addition of flocculant polymer at the rapid mixing stage polydadmac snf floquat 4520 a very highly charged cationic polymer with a high molecular weight in a liquid form was added as additional coagulant polymer snf ga usa 2 4 microbial inhibition assays the sludge used in activity test originated from a semi technical sidestream deammonification sequencing batch reactor sbr located in blue plains zhang et al 2016 batch experiments were performed to determine the inhibition factors of thp ad filtrate on the anaob and aeraob activities to avoid any impact of high ammonium or free ammonia levels 2 3 of the ammonium in the reject water was stripped out at an increased ph of 10 naoh addition after which the ph was corrected to 7 5 h2so4 addition chemical oxygen demand cod fractionations were measured showing that the difference before and after stripping was less than 10 i e in the range of measurement error all experiments started with 280 mg nh4 n l 2500 mg caco3 l as alkalinity and 20 mg no2 n l in anoxic tests an extra inhibition test was done to see the combined impact of ammonium and cod thus without ammonia stripping a synthetic medium of the same osmotic strength and ammonium content 1500 mg nh4 n l as the thp ad filtrate was prepared replacing a certain percentage of thp ad filtrate on a volume basis the aeraob and anaob inhibition were derived from comparing conversion rates in the treatments with filtrate to the control sets no filtrate 2 5 cod fractionation other chemical analyses and calculation methods four fractions were considered within total cod codtot based on four cod measurements per sample codtot and dissolved cod coddiss were directly measured and particulate cod codpart large colloidal cod codcoll l and small colloidal cod codcoll s were indirectly derived based on two additional measurements codpart 1 0 μm was obtained by subtracting the concentration after direct 1 0 μm filtration whatman ge healthcare uk of the raw sample coddiss was considered as the fraction that was not retained after flocculation znso4 and filtration of colloids over 0 45 μm so called flocculated filtered cod codcoll s flocculated filtered 0 45 μm was obtained by subtracting coddiss from the value obtained after direct 0 45 μm filtration of the raw sample codcoll l 0 45 1 0 μm was derived using filtration over 1 0 μm and subsequent subtraction of coddiss codcoll s sludge ts cake solids ts total suspended solids tss and volatile suspended solids vss were measured according to standard methods american public health association 1999 nh4 no2 no3 and cod were measured spectrophotometrically using hach vial kits dr 2000 hach co usa volatile fatty acids vfa were measured using gas chromatographic gc methods lu et al 2015 2 6 model description and comparison two classes of models were used using the results from 97 batch experiments to estimate inhibitor affinities on aeraob and anaob model class 1 was based on direct biological inhibition altering the values of the maximum growth rate μmax and inhibitor affinity k i to quantify the effects of direct inhibitors i assuming that diffusion limitations are constant i e independent of the inhibitor s han and levenspiel 1988 model 1a used the conventional approach 1 μ μ max s s k s k i i k i in which μ max maximum specific

particulates and large colloids all other parameters such as r0 sh and were considered constant as activity tests were performed in a short term and were cancelled out in the model fitting see supplementary material s1 the values for s i and ks not impacted by diffusion were set using values in the batch tests while μmax and ki were fitted for aeraob the oxygen affinity coefficient ko2 was set at 0 25 mg o2 l al omari et al 2015 and so2 3 5 mg o2 l during the test for anaob the nitrite affinity coefficient kno2 was set at 0 5 mg no2 n l al omari et al 2015 and sno2 20 mg no2 n l during the test all other non limiting substrates e g nahco3 and nh4 were not taken into account in the tests as all cod fractions were interlinked principal component analysis pca was firstly used for statistical analysis to describe and summarize the dataset by reducing the dimensionality and providing deeper understanding the correlation between variables using factominer package in r software francois husson et al 2018 secondly minpack lm and nlstools packages in r software were used to find the best fit and standard error of values of each model florent baty et al 2015 timur et al 2016 lastly the goodness of the model fitting was quantified in three ways by comparing the total squared error tse the mean squared error mse and a statistical f test the last indicates whether the fit of different models was significantly different shown by a probability number p value smaller than or equal to 0 05 3 results the fractionation of organics in thp ad filtrate was as follows belt filter press operation from january to june 2015 12 8 particulate 620 402 mg codpart l 15 5 colloidal of which 5 3 large colloids and 12 6 small colloids 211 155 mg codcolloidal l l and 458 198 mg codcolloidal s l and 73 8 soluble organics 3575 930 mg coddiss l to elucidate the inhibitory impacts of different cod fractions within the thp ad filtrate samples were taken from different ad systems lab full scale operational periods stable unstable with different pretreatment methods and different dewatering conditions 3 1 impact of anaerobic digester performance vfa and other biodegradable organics three different types of filtrate from the lab scale stable and full scale stable and unstable ads were used in the tests to evaluate the impact of digester performance the filtrate composition of the samples is shown in table 1 although coddiss was similar between the lab and full scale system during stable operation the full scale ad had slightly higher particulate and colloidal cod concentrations the comparison showed no significant difference in aeraob inhibition under stable anaerobic digestion fig 1 a an additional test was performed at the original ammonium concentration from the stable full scale ad filtrate 1500 mg n l instead of constant 280 mg n l allowing higher volume exposures to be tested this showed a similar inhibition degree as the one with lower ammonium levels fig 1a overall aeraob lost 50 of its activity when exposed to 40 of lab scale ad filtrate 46 of full scale ad filtrate lower ammonium free ammonia concentration and 30 of full scale ad filtrate higher ammonium free ammonia concentration respectively fig 1a in contrast for anaob significantly higher inhibition was observed when exposed to filtrate from full scale ad resulting in no measurable anaob activity at 25 volume exposure of filtrate while in case of the lab scale digester still 54 5 anaob activity remained fig 1b when the digester showed instability as characterized by vfa accumulation and decreased biogas production all cod concentrations increased table 1 i the largest increase was in coddiss of which 25 was due to the increase of acetate as the main vfa present from 100 mg cod l to 1383 mg cod l the increase of cod due to the digester instability resulted in statistically higher inhibition on aeraob and anaob fig 1a b residual anaob activity was less than 10 when exposed to 10 of the unstable filtrate fig 1b indicating that anaob were highly sensitive to the digester performance aeraob activity decreased initially only slightly by 11 5 at 10 of filtrate volume exposure however activity loss was more substantial at higher exposure 30 4 of residue activity at 46 volume exposure fig 1c since a considerable acetate level was observed in the unstable ad filtrate an extra test was performed spiking acetate to stable ad filtrate 10 reaching a similar final concentration of 1250 mg acetate cod l this yielded statistically the same result fig 1c d indicating the acetate did not contribute to the additional inhibition observed in unstable ad filtrate 3 2 impact of pretreatment the first pretreatment tests examined the biodegradability of the inhibitory organics the filtrate was treated aerobically for 1 day to verify the impact of short term aeration removing mainly vfa and some readily biodegradable organics coddiss decreased from 3574 to 1948 mg cod l the results showed that inhibitions on aeraob and anaob were not significantly reduced compared to non treated full scale ad filtrate stable fig 1c d to investigate the impact of all biodegradable organics filtrate underwent a more extended biological treatment both aerobic and anaerobic this aimed at evaluating if the observed inhibitory impacts shown in fig 1 a d were related to the recalcitrant or biodegradable fractions comparing organics to full scale unstable filtrate all cod fractions decreased after 4 day aerobic pretreatment and 12 day anaerobic treatment compositions shown in table 1 i and ii for aeraob no significant inhibition was observed with the pretreated filtrate indicating the original loss of aeraob activity was most likely related to slowly biodegradable cod fig 1a e for anaob however there was no clear relation between biodegradable cod and activity loss as anaob were still totally inhibited when exposed to more than 30 filtrate fig 1b f to further identify the potential inhibitors on aeraob and possible remedies to avoid such compounds additional pretreatments were performed based on the biological 1 2 or chemical nature 3 4 5 of the activity limiting compounds 1 micronutrient addition 2 six month filtrate storage 4 c 3 coagulation precipitation through iron or zinc addition 4 extraction using hexane 5 sorption of specific organics on biochar and activated carbon adding extra micronutrients in the filtrate did not mitigate the activity loss table 2 indicating that the filtrate composition did not cause growth limitation for the aeraob after six month storage the filtrate showed an inhibition of 39 0 0 5 similar to the fresh filtrate indicating that biodegradable organic fraction underwent few changes during storage as for the pretreatments chemically removing the particular organic fraction no significant impact was observed for the precipitation with iron or zinc extraction with solvent or sorption on biochar table 2 interestingly sorption on activated carbon showed a clear potential of removing the inhibitory compounds for aeraob furthermore the impact of activated carbon on alleviating anaob inhibition was also demonstrated decreasing the inhibition significantly from 42 6 to 2 6 at 20 of volume exposure 3 3 impact of dewatering efficiency to understand the impact of colloidal and particulate cod fractions and to examine the optimal dewatering conditions changes in flocculant polymer flopam dose were tested table 1 iii along with dosage variations in polydadmac or fecl3 as coagulants table 1 iv and v opd of the flocculant polymer was around 10 g flopam kg sludge ts and no improvement in dewatering was observed with a further increase in polymer dose fig 2 a a coagulant polydadmac or fecl3 was added to differentially capture particulate and colloidal fractions dosing polydadmac and fecl3 in addition to 10 g flopam kg sludge ts significantly improved the filtrate quality by capturing more particulate and colloidal cod fig 2 b c polydadmac captured the large colloids efficiently reducing codcoll l from around 500 to 155 mg cod l but could not efficiently capture the small colloids fig 2b table 1 iv fecl3 captured both large and small colloids resulting around 200 mg cod l of small colloids from a dose of 2 g polydadmac kg sludge ts and 70 g fecl3 kg sludge ts onwards no additional improvement was observed fig 2 b c the biological impact of the presence absence of these coagulant dosages was therefore tested in the subsequent microbial activity tests for aeraob dewatering without coagulants i e using only flopam during dewatering yielded a filtrate composition with around 1200 mg codpart l 500 mg codcoll l l and 400 mg codcoll s l fig 2a the lowest aeraob inhibition 13 8 was obtained at an optimal flopam dose of 10 g flopam kg sludge ts fig 3 a underdosing of polymer 7 g flopam kg sludge ts led to an increase in particulate and colloidal cod content in the filtrate and an aeraob inhibition of 36 7 8 9 however overdosing 14 g flopam kg sludge ts also lowered aeraob rates by 31 4 7 9 which might have been caused by the presence of residual polymer potentially creating oxygen uptake limitation due to diffusion resistance fig 3a adding coagulant only improved the aeraob activity in the case of polydadmac the addition of polydadmac efficiently captured the large colloidal fraction as indicated above lowering the aeraob inhibition to a minimum for filtrate from unstable full scale thp ad operation fig 3c table 1 iv v a similar experiment was performed under stable ad performance as shown in fig 3c as a lower large colloidal fraction was automatically obtained under stable ad table 1 iv v aeraob rates were not improved significantly fig 3c though fecl3 captured both large and small colloids no clear improvement in the aeraob activity was observed fig 3c which might relate to the potential impact of excess fecl3 in the filtrate therefore assuming 10 of the dosed fecl3 would remain in the filtrate an additional batch test was performed by adding 333 mg fecl3 l to filtrate only dewatered by flocculant polymer dose higher aeraob activity loss at fecl3 dosing was observed 34 10 compared to 21 4 activity loss when exposed to filtrate only dosed by flopam confirming the hypothesis of harmful residual fecl3 as the previous experiments optimized flopam dose before coagulant dose polydadmac this was reverted in an additional experiment results in fig 2b pointed at 2 g polydadmac kg sludge ts as a minimum to improve the capture efficiency of large colloidal cod additional dewatering tests showed that the presence of this coagulant level increased the capture efficiency for particulate and colloidal matter increased enabling to lower the flocculant dose fig 4 a b indeed the capture efficiency of large colloids increased to 70 80 at total polymer dose of 6 2 g polymer kg sludge ts i e containing 4 2 g flopam g sludge ts fig 4b however in the absence of polydadmac about 9 g flopam kg sludge ts was needed to achieve a similar effect fig 4a for anaob in all dewatering tests no substantial improvements on anaob rates were achieved fig 3b d indicating that particulate and colloidal cod potentially did not play a major role in anaob inhibition 3 4 model based mechanisms of lowered activities in order to identify the mechanisms lowering aeraob and anaob activities different model types were fitted to the data obtained from the batch experiments as only short term testing was performed in this study the focus was on identification of direct inhibition impacts k i impacts and diffusion impacts k s impacts model class 1 was based on direct inhibitors i assuming diffusion limitations were independent of the inhibitor cod fractionating was not considered i codtot the conventional monod approach was used in model 1a s eq 1 while model 1b incorporated a minimum function yielding full impact of the rate limiting step s eq 2 supplementary material s2 and s3 model 1a estimated k i values of 1519 155 and 269 32 mg codtot l for aeraob and anaob respectively table 3 fig 5 with model 1b slightly lower k i values were obtained of 1282 122 and 258 30 mg codtot l for aeraob and anaob respectively comparing the goodness of fit of both models the conventional approach model 1a was found superior to the minimum model model 1b as the latter yielded higher tse mse and rse table 3 in model class 2 next to direct inhibitors i also diffusional inhibitors id were taken into account as compounds influencing the diffusion of substrates and direct inhibitors to perform a preliminary screening as to which cod fraction corresponds to which inhibitor type pca was performed using all batch test data this revealed that the four cod fractions could be categorized in two or three classes with a differential impact on aeraob and anaob activities either coddiss codcoll s vs codcoll l codpart or coddiss codcoll s vs codcoll l vs codpart fig s 1 soluble and small colloidal cod were grouped as one fraction and considered to only cause direct inhibition i coddiss codcoll s for large colloidal and particulate cod an impact of the diffusion resistance was anticipated either lumped into one inhibitor in model 2a id codpart codcoll l s eq 3 or treated as separate inhibitors in model 2b id 1 codpart id 2 codcoll l s eq 4 supplementary material s4 and s5 when implementing model 2a s eq 3 for aeraob the estimated parameters indicated a major sensitivity to compounds causing diffusional resistance as the k i value was considerably lower compared to model 1 and as k i d was considerably lower than k i table 3 however despite a slightly lower tse model 2a did not render a better fit than model 1 as mse increased and the f test showed no significant improvement p 0 05 for model 2b discriminating between the individual contributions by particulate and large colloidal organics a relatively high k i d value was obtained for codpart and a low value for codcoll l indicating that the latter was mainly causing the diffusion resistance model 2b provided the best fit for aeraob inhibition as obtained tse and mse were the lowest and the f test showed significant improvement compared to models 1 and 2a p 0 05 another model fitting was performed by considering small colloidal cod as a diffusional impactor data not shown the results predicted a k i for codcoll s of 2744 405 mg cod l a value considerably above the maximum observed concentration of small colloidal cod in thp ad filtrate it can therefore be concluded that codcoll s did not limit substrate diffusion for anaob the direct only inhibition models did not show improvement of including a minimum function model 1b as tse and mse did not lower compared to model 1a table 3 furthermore the inclusion of diffusional limitation in model 2 yielded no significant improvement in fit as shown by the f tests p 0 05 table 3 models 2a and 2b estimated relatively low and high values for kid and kind respectively indicating indeed that diffusion resistance was limited table 3 4 discussion 4 1 organics inhibiting aeraob thp ad filtrate caused direct aeraob inhibition linked to biodegradable dissolved organic compounds excluding acetate the model however indicated aeraob were less sensitive to soluble compounds than anaob with an estimated k i for coddiss coll s about 4 times above the one for aeraob the aeraob inhibition could be mitigated by extended biological treatment aerobic or anaerobic or activated carbon adsorption the latter process is widely used to adsorb polar compounds for instance in soil remediation removing hydrophobic organic contaminants and polychlorinated biphenyls hale et al 2013 marchal et al 2013 vasilyeva et al 2006 it is unclear why biochar could not overcome aeraob inhibition though it has similar properties in theory each of the three options could be implemented to lower the biodegradable cod content in thp ad filtrate i by treating the filtrate aerobically e g in a trickling filter ii by extending the srt in ad e g with a post digester or iii by installing an activated carbon process however such pretreament approaches require an additional unit process and are not practically feasible or cost effective preferentially the inhibition can be prevented or cured by altering the operation of the existing processes e g by increasing the aerobic srt or the dilution of the filtrate additional clues are expected from a deeper analytical characterization of differences in dissolved organics in thp ad vs conventional ad filtrate besides the direct effect the filtrate s organics also indirectly lowered the aeraob activity with particulates and large colloids putatively limiting the diffusion of substrates a clear relationship between the dewatering performance and aeraob activities was shown similar to earlier studies showing the important influence of diffusion on nitrification kinetics in practice for instance in case of an increased solids load to the system during storm events armstrong 2008 shaw et al 2015 stenstrom and poduska 1980 optimizing flocculant polymer dose to reduce residue solids or polymer in thp ad filtrate diminished the aeraob inhibition fig 3a this is in line with observations in full scale operation of sidestream deammonification where a high tss inflow led to decreased turnover rates of aeraob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and restoring of the aeraob activity was achieved after doubling the aeration time and increasing the do concentration of up to 1 mg o2 l joss et al 2011 in contrast to the under dosed filtrate the polymer residue in the over dosed filtrate can cause foaming issues and potentially diffusion limitations as observed in 30 of the plants lackner et al 2014 in contrast to the under dosed filtrate the polymer residue in the over dosed filtrate can cause foaming issues and potentially diffusion limitations as observed in 30 of the plants lackner et al 2014 the impact of foaming on reactor performance created substrate intake limitation and the recovery usually takes about1 5 days confirming that the system is not inhibited the aeraob inhibition from large colloids could be significantly prevented although not completely removed by optimizing the dewatering stage i e adding coagulant to better capture this fraction especially during unstable digestion fig 3c model 2b showed that separating the particle sizes 0 45 1 μm vs 1μm led to a relatively low k i value for large colloidal cod 7 6 1 3 mg codcoll l l pinpointing this fraction as a key inhibitor class to aeraob compared to the typical content of large colloids in thp ad filtrate 211 151 mg codcoll l l the low k i indicated that the large colloidal fraction was the rate limiting factor under high levels of colloidal matter oxygen transfer efficiency decreased resulting in limited do availability and consequently a poor nitrification performance germain et al 2007 wu et al 2013 li et al 2018 observed the decrease of oxygen availability lowered substrate conversion in biofilms due to the high loadings of particulate organics in wastewater which resulted in 20 70 of dissolved oxygen flux reduction from the biofilm surface into biofilm matrix coagulants neutralize the negative electric charge on particles and destabilize the forces keeping colloids apart poon and chu 1999 the large colloidal fractions in the case of thp ad filtrate had more impact on aeraob flocs possible due to the relative small aeraob floc size compared to the anaob granules han et al 2016 vlaeminck et al 2010 the diffusion impact on the aeraob containing flocs was relatively dominant creating diffusion limitation of substrates e g oxygen or ammonium rather than directly impacting the cell s metabolism or growth rate negatively the curative strategy of increasing the do level helps to overcome diffusion limitation and improve ammonium removal rates as confirmed by zhang et al 2016 additionally unlike the inhibition related to the soluble factions the lowered aeraob rates caused by diffusion limitation are usually transient reversible and easy to notice adequate trace nutrient concentrations including metal ions and vitamins are necessary to have a diverse microbial community thrive in an activated sludge plant especially when treating certain types of industrial wastewater burgess et al 1999 jefferson et al 2001 klein et al 2013 and nifong et al 2013 observed a full scale sidestream deammonification system instability due to the micronutrient limitations the activity test in this study showed that the biomass inhibition was not related to acute micronutrient deficiency table 2 long term operation is however necessary to validate if adding extra bioavailable micronutrients might be helpful to compensate for the decreased growth rates and or increased decay rates 4 2 organics inhibiting anaob for anaob the kinetic tests indicated that soluble organics in thp ad filtrate were the primary source of inhibition potentially related to the nonbiodegradable fraction concentrations of dissolved organics were tightly related to thp and ad operation stability however due to the multitude and complexity of the organics it is an analytical challenge to identify the specific inhibitors dwyer et al 2008 reported an increased presence of recalcitrant organic compounds in thp ad filtrate was related to the pretreatment at an excessively high temperature higher than 170 190 c which led to significant changes in a generation of recalcitrant n and cod meanwhile these soluble inhibitory organics were not easily removed via aerobic and anaerobic treatment as the remaining anaob activity was lower than 80 fig 1f gupta et al 2015 showed that organic matter in the thp ad filtrate could not be efficiently removed by aerobic biological treatment the biodegradable organics related to the digester instability increased inhibition and can be caused by variable e g shock loading resulting in partial sludge degradation and associated accumulation of surface active substances and subsequent foaming issues ganidi et al 2009 the total nitrogen removal rate in a lab scale sidestream deammonification system decreased with 90 resulting in substantial nitrite accumulation 20 mg no2 n l when fed with filtrate containing increased soluble organics 5934 680 mg cod l caused by digester overloading zhang et al 2016 an increase in vfa concentration usually occurs as an indicator and consequence of unstable ad chen et al 2008 iv 2003 as also seen in this study with an increase of soluble cod from 2762 mg cod l to 6600 mg cod l in the filtrate with around 35 of the increase due to acetate however actual vfa concentrations in unstable filtrate were a lot lower than the inhibitory levels for anaob observed in previous studies dapena mora et al 2004 molinuevo et al 2009 in comparison to our acetate value of 1 3 g cod l in unstable thp ad filtrate kindaichi et al 2016 observed that concentrations up to 3 2 g cod l of acetate had no effects on anaob the acetate spike test at 1 3 g cod l also confirmed no impact on the anaob activity fig 1d model runs confirmed the sensitivity of anaob towards soluble cod the estimated k i of 250 mg cod l is 4 times lower than the toxicity level at 800 mg cod l observed in the long term sbr operation zhang et al 2016 this higher level can relate to an underloaded anaob inventory resulting from efficient anaob retention in the sbr however once inhibition has been observed in sidestream deammonification it usually takes the biomass a month to recover therefore longer srt and good anaob retention are necessary to compensate for the decreased growth rates furthermore even with actions taken in thp and ad improvements in filtrate composition lag because of the long srt in ad thus monitoring the digesters performance is important and upon instability manifested by less methane foaming more vfa and ammonia etc it is necessary to dilute the filtrate more the full scale deammonification system at dc water is designed to treat thp ad at a 1 1 dilution ratio with water zhang et al 2016 the potential drawback of a higher dilution is the temperature loss especially in winter time 5 conclusion this paper investigated four organic fractions in the filtrate from anaerobic digestion preceded by thermal hydrolysis to identify specific inhibition compounds and mechanisms for aeraob and anaob furthermore the findings were confronted with a global mechanistic inhibition model aeraob were inhibited directly from dissolved organics and indirectly with particulate and colloidal fractions causing diffusion limitation the latter can be resolved through optimization of the dewatering process in terms of flocculant and coagulant polymer dosing to obtain a better capture of the colloidal fraction to the sludge cake an inhibition model including diffusion resistance based on the porter equation showed the best fit with the experimental data and highlighted that aeraob were highly sensitive to large colloids for anaob it was found activity was mainly impacted by dissolved organics in the filtrate tightly linked to the thp and digester performance not by changes in the

19429,treatment of sewage sludge with a thermal hydrolysis process thp followed by anaerobic digestion ad enables to boost biogas production and minimize residual sludge volumes however the reject water can cause inhibition to aerobic and anoxic ammonium oxidizing bacteria aeraob anaob the two key microbial groups involved in the deammonification process firstly a detailed investigation elucidated the impact of different organic fractions present in thp ad return liquor on aeraob and anaob activity for anaob soluble compounds linked to thp conditions and ad performance caused the main inhibition direct inhibition by dissolved organics was also observed for aeraob but could be overcome by treating the filtrate with extended aerobic or anaerobic incubation or with activated carbon aeraob additionally suffered from particulate and colloidal organics limiting the diffusion of substrates this was resolved by improving the dewatering process through an optimized flocculant polymer dose and or addition of coagulant polymer to better capture the large colloidal fraction especially in case of unstable ad performance secondly a new inhibition model for aeraob included diffusion limiting compounds based on the porter equation and achieved the best fit with the experimental data highlighting that aeraob were highly sensitive to large colloids overall this paper for the first time provides separate identification of organic fractions within thp ad filtrate causing differential types of inhibition moreover it highlights the combined effect of the performance of thp ad and dewatering on the downstream autotrophic nitrogen removal kinetics graphical abstract image 1 keywords biological nutrient removal partial nitrification anammox water resources recovery facility 1 introduction thermal hydrolysis processes thp are well established as reliable and energy efficient ways to intensify solids handling in sewage treatment by creating a change in the rheology of the waste sludge which allows for increased loading rates resulting in smaller digester volumes barber 2016 in addition this technology lowers the bound water fraction in sludge thus resulting in an increased cake solids concentration after dewatering irrespective of dewatering equipment bader 1978 jolis 2008 pickworth et al 2006 the combination of thp and anaerobic digestion ad has been applied worldwide e g at hias wastewater treatment plant wwtp hamar norway hengelo wwtp hengelo the netherlands oxley creek water reclamation plant australia and blue plains advanced wwtp dc water washington dc usa dwyer et al 2008 pickworth et al 2006 the rapid decompression due to releasing steam reduces the sludge particle size by 40 50 while higher levels of colloidal and particulate organics were observed in the returned liquor compared to the returned liquor from conventional ad barber 2016 bougrier et al 2008 feng et al 2014 haug 1978 zhang et al 2016 this can potentially be resolved by adding coagulants which enhance the capture of fine solids or by allowing for enhanced flocculation under optimized combinations of shear and exposure time niu et al 2013 poon and chu 1999 deammonification or partial nitritation anammox is well established as resource efficient nitrogen removal process with 100 full scale applications and is particularly suitable to treat dewatering liquor from sludge ad lackner et al 2014 most observed limitations in performance have been associated with aerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria aeraob due to sensitivity towards organics substances micronutrient limitation or free ammonia inhibition gujer 2010 sinha and annachhatre 2006 limitations on anoxic ammonium oxidizing or anammox bacteria anaob because of similar factors are mostly compensated by efficient and enhanced retention of anaob creating a larger buffer in anaob biomass han et al 2016 in recent years the application of deammonification has stepwise been expanded to treat livestock wastewater diluted landfill leachate and thp digestate all these types of wastewater contain a wider range of inorganic and organic compounds compared to conventional sewage sludge ad effluent with reported challenges for efficient and stable deammonifaction treatment dapena mora et al 2006 ganigué et al 2008 kindaichi et al 2016 lotti et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 for thp cell lysis under the high temperatures yields ad filtrate higher in organic compounds concentration barber 2016 which has shown to be partially inhibitory towards aeraob and anaob figdore et al 2011 challenging efficient n removal chan 2015 zhang et al 2016 when comparing deammonification treatment of conventional ad filtrate with treatment of thp ad filtrate in two long term reactors decreased aeraob rates were observed when treating thp ad filtrate potentially caused by increased level of organics present in thp ad filtrate zhang et al 2016 optimization of key control parameters enabled efficient treatment including increased dissolved oxygen do set point 1 mg o2 l longer aeration times and selective anaob retention through screens zhang et al 2016 when ad instability yielded increased digestate concentrations of volatile fatty acids and other organics these soluble and colloidal compounds decreased the deammonification performance considerably zhang et al 2016 the link between thp and creation of inhibitory compounds was also observed at full scale with the performance of sidestream deammonification decreasing after upstream implementation of thp chan 2015 however to the best of our knowledge no specific inhibitory factors have yet been identified within thp ad filtrate nor have the inhibition mechanisms for aeraob and anaob been unraveled monod microbial growth kinetics are the simplest and most popular rate expression assuming that every single essential substrate is a growth limiting factor beg and hassan 1987 han and levenspiel 1988 to include inhibition related limitations in growth rate monod type models were further developed based on three ways of inhibition han and levenspiel 1988 i competitive inhibition yielding an increased substrate affinity constant ks but not affecting the maximum specific growth rate μmax ii non competitive inhibition lowering μmax but not impacting ks and iii uncompetitive inhibition combining aspects of non competitive and competitive inhibition i e affecting both ks and μmax interestingly recent work of shaw et al 2015 has shown that ks is not a constant but the maximum rate and diffusion influence this parameter with a relationship established based on a linear data fit and the porter diffusion model this concept was shown to be widely applicable as shown by fits for denitrification biofilm and floc nitrification and anaerobic digestion shaw et al 2015 summarizing inhibitors can be described as i direct causing decreased microbial growth rates hereby assuming inhibitors do not influence the diffusion to the cells i e non competitive inhibition by using an inverted monod factor of the so called direct inhibitor and ii diffusional indirect limiting diffusion represented by an increased ks value i e competitive inhibition through including the porter equation on the affinities for substrate and direct inhibitors in the case of thp ad filtrate diffusion limitation on aeraob containing flocs caused by the increased particulate and colloidal fractions was suggested to be responsible for decreased ammonium conversion rates zhang et al 2016 inclusion of this mechanism in a model is hypothesized to improve the predictability of deammonification performance the first objective of this study was to identify the short term inhibition effects and mechanisms exerted by the soluble colloidal and particulate organics in thp ad filtrate on aeraob and anaob activities hereto batch experiments were performed using non acclimated deammonification sludge tests related to examining whether inhibition was linked to 1 quality of the thp ad filtrate 2 additional pretreatment options 3 performance of the dewatering stage flocculant coagulant polymer dose the second objective was to develop and evaluate a microbial kinetic model identifying specific contributions of organic fractions to either direct or diffusional limitations in conversion activities both for aeraob and anaob 2 materials and methods 2 1 thp ad reactors anaerobic sludge for dewatering was obtained from two types of ad systems firstly a semi technical scale 60 l reactor was used fed with thermally hydrolyzed sludge at 165 c 30 min dc water washington dc usa this digester was stably operated at 15 days solids retention time srt with a feed total solids ts concentration of about 10 5 yielding 50 volatile solids vs reduction at 38 5 1 c secondly one of the four full scale anaerobic digesters was sampled which was started up in october 2014 with an increasing feed loading from the same thp process the digesters were operated around 20 days srt at 38 c fed with 9 5 ts with 70 vs reduction 2 2 sludge dewatering filtrate production the ad sludge was dewatered including rapid mixing flocculation and belt press shear followed by gravity drainage through a belt filter cloth the remaining solids were mechanically dewatered using a centrifuge at 3000 g for 10 min higgins et al 2014 flopam 4440 snf ga usa a polyelectrolyte with a very high molecular weight and median cationic charge 35 was used as flocculation polymer the optimal polymer dose opd was determined based on filtrate quality by establishing a polymer dosing response curve which varies depending on the digester operation conditions 2 3 description of filtrate applied in the tests 2 3 1 filtrate quality at digester stability and unstability the lab scale digester was stably operated for two years to compare to the full scale digesters zhang et al 2016 for the full scale digesters representative samples were obtained for unstable and stable behavior the unstable full scale ad refers to inconsistent loading and inadequate mixing in the digester one month after reaching its full loading rate during this event the digesters experienced foaming increased volatile fatty acids vfa concentrations and decreased ph alkalinity specific gravity and biogas methane content four months after the digesters recovered from the unstable period mentioned above another sludge sample was taken and underwent the same inhibition activity tests referred to in this study as stable full scale ad 2 3 2 filtrate pretreatment procedures five procedures were tested to remove specific classes of inhibiting components prior to the activity tests first micronutrient addition in the filtrate was tested to check the growth limitation secondly the effect of biodegradable compounds was examined a one day aerobic treatment was executed aerating the full scale filtrate for one day in the presence of nitrifying activated sludge 3 4 g tss l aiming to remove vfa and some other readily biodegradable organics then long term aerobic and anaerobic treatment were performed to remove biodegradable cod bcod in the aerobic pretreatment the full scale filtrate was aerated at a dissolved oxygen do level above 4 0 mg o2 l for seven days after addition of nitrifying activated sludge 3 4 g tss l until no decrease in soluble cod was observed for the last four days in the anaerobic pretreatment sludge was derived from biochemical methane potential tests until only refractory cod remained in the sludge after twelve days inoculation stuckey and mccarty 1984 thirdly precipitation with fe3 and zn2 was tested iron iii sulfate 1 g fe l or zinc sulfate 1 g zn l was added under ph control after which precipitates were removed by centrifugation 10 000 g 10 min fourthly filtrate was added to hexane as extraction solvent on 1 2 vol basis followed by shaking and re separation in a separatory funnel finally adsorption to activated carbon was investigated by adding biochar pa usa and granular activated carbon donau chemie austria to the filtrate stirring the mixture for 30 min and removing with centrifugation 10 000 g 10 min 2 3 3 addition of fecl3 and polydadmac as coagulants two conditioning processes were used to alter the cod fractions in the filtrate composition i e flocculation and coagulation flocculation as coagulants fecl3 and polydadmac were injected before the addition of flocculant polymer at the rapid mixing stage polydadmac snf floquat 4520 a very highly charged cationic polymer with a high molecular weight in a liquid form was added as additional coagulant polymer snf ga usa 2 4 microbial inhibition assays the sludge used in activity test originated from a semi technical sidestream deammonification sequencing batch reactor sbr located in blue plains zhang et al 2016 batch experiments were performed to determine the inhibition factors of thp ad filtrate on the anaob and aeraob activities to avoid any impact of high ammonium or free ammonia levels 2 3 of the ammonium in the reject water was stripped out at an increased ph of 10 naoh addition after which the ph was corrected to 7 5 h2so4 addition chemical oxygen demand cod fractionations were measured showing that the difference before and after stripping was less than 10 i e in the range of measurement error all experiments started with 280 mg nh4 n l 2500 mg caco3 l as alkalinity and 20 mg no2 n l in anoxic tests an extra inhibition test was done to see the combined impact of ammonium and cod thus without ammonia stripping a synthetic medium of the same osmotic strength and ammonium content 1500 mg nh4 n l as the thp ad filtrate was prepared replacing a certain percentage of thp ad filtrate on a volume basis the aeraob and anaob inhibition were derived from comparing conversion rates in the treatments with filtrate to the control sets no filtrate 2 5 cod fractionation other chemical analyses and calculation methods four fractions were considered within total cod codtot based on four cod measurements per sample codtot and dissolved cod coddiss were directly measured and particulate cod codpart large colloidal cod codcoll l and small colloidal cod codcoll s were indirectly derived based on two additional measurements codpart 1 0 μm was obtained by subtracting the concentration after direct 1

flocculated filtered cod codcoll s flocculated filtered 0 45 μm was obtained by subtracting coddiss from the value obtained after direct 0 45 μm filtration of the raw sample codcoll l 0 45 1 0 μm was derived using filtration over 1 0 μm and subsequent subtraction of coddiss codcoll s sludge ts cake solids ts total suspended solids tss and volatile suspended solids vss were measured according to standard methods american public health association 1999 nh4 no2 no3 and cod were measured spectrophotometrically using hach vial kits dr 2000 hach co usa volatile fatty acids vfa were measured using gas chromatographic gc methods lu et al 2015 2 6 model description and comparison two classes of models were used using the results from 97 batch experiments to estimate inhibitor affinities on aeraob and anaob model class 1 was based on direct biological inhibition altering the values of the maximum growth rate μmax and inhibitor affinity k i to quantify the effects of direct inhibitors i assuming

particulates and large colloids all other parameters such as r0 sh and were considered constant as activity tests were performed in a short term and were cancelled out in the model fitting see supplementary material s1 the values for s i and ks not impacted by diffusion were set using values in the batch tests while μmax and ki were fitted for aeraob the oxygen affinity coefficient ko2 was set at 0 25 mg o2 l al omari et al 2015 and so2 3 5 mg o2 l during the test for anaob the nitrite affinity coefficient kno2 was set at 0 5 mg no2 n l al omari et al 2015 and sno2 20 mg no2 n l during the test all other non limiting substrates e g nahco3 and nh4 were not taken into account in the tests as all cod fractions were interlinked principal component analysis pca was firstly used for statistical analysis to describe and summarize the dataset by reducing the dimensionality and providing deeper understanding the correlation between variables using factominer package in r software francois husson et al 2018 secondly minpack lm and nlstools packages in r software were used to find the best fit and standard error of values of each model florent baty et al 2015 timur et al 2016 lastly the goodness of the model fitting was quantified in three ways by comparing the total squared error tse the mean squared error mse and a statistical f test the last indicates whether the fit of different models was significantly different shown by a probability number p value smaller than or equal to 0 05 3 results the fractionation of organics in thp ad filtrate was as follows belt filter press operation from january to june 2015 12 8 particulate 620 402 mg codpart l 15 5 colloidal of which 5 3 large colloids and 12 6 small colloids 211 155 mg codcolloidal l l and 458 198 mg codcolloidal s l and 73 8 soluble organics 3575 930 mg coddiss l to elucidate the inhibitory impacts of different cod fractions within the thp ad filtrate samples were taken from different ad systems lab full scale operational periods stable unstable with different pretreatment methods and different dewatering conditions 3 1 impact of anaerobic digester performance vfa and other biodegradable organics three different types of filtrate from the lab scale stable and full scale stable and unstable ads were used in the tests to evaluate the impact of digester performance the filtrate composition of the samples is shown in table 1 although coddiss was similar between the lab and full scale system during stable operation the full scale ad had slightly higher particulate and colloidal cod concentrations the comparison showed no significant difference in aeraob inhibition under stable anaerobic digestion fig 1 a an additional test was performed at the original ammonium concentration from the stable full scale ad filtrate 1500 mg n l instead of constant 280 mg n l allowing higher volume exposures to be tested this showed a similar inhibition degree as the one with lower ammonium levels fig 1a overall aeraob lost 50 of its activity when exposed to 40 of lab scale ad filtrate 46 of full scale ad filtrate lower ammonium free ammonia concentration and 30 of full scale ad filtrate higher ammonium free ammonia concentration respectively fig 1a in contrast for anaob significantly higher inhibition was observed when exposed to filtrate from full scale ad resulting in no measurable anaob activity at 25 volume exposure of filtrate while in case of the lab scale digester still 54 5 anaob activity remained fig 1b when the digester showed instability as characterized by vfa accumulation and decreased biogas production all cod concentrations increased table 1 i the largest increase was in coddiss of which 25 was due to the increase of acetate as the main vfa present from 100 mg cod l to 1383 mg cod l the increase of cod due to the digester instability resulted in statistically higher inhibition on aeraob and anaob fig 1a b residual anaob activity was less than 10 when exposed to 10 of the unstable filtrate fig 1b indicating that anaob were highly sensitive to the digester performance aeraob activity decreased initially only slightly by 11 5 at 10 of filtrate volume exposure however activity loss was more substantial at higher exposure 30 4 of residue activity at 46 volume exposure fig 1c since a considerable acetate level was observed in the unstable ad filtrate an extra test was performed spiking acetate to stable ad filtrate 10 reaching a similar final concentration of 1250 mg acetate cod l this yielded statistically the same result fig 1c d indicating the acetate did not contribute to the additional inhibition observed in unstable ad filtrate 3 2 impact of pretreatment the first pretreatment tests examined the biodegradability of the inhibitory organics the filtrate was treated aerobically for 1 day to verify the impact of short term aeration removing mainly vfa and some readily biodegradable organics coddiss decreased from 3574 to 1948 mg cod l the results showed that inhibitions on aeraob and anaob were not significantly reduced compared to non treated full scale ad filtrate stable fig 1c d to investigate the impact of all biodegradable organics filtrate underwent a more extended biological treatment both aerobic and anaerobic this aimed at evaluating if the observed inhibitory impacts shown in fig 1 a d were related to the recalcitrant or biodegradable fractions comparing organics to full scale unstable filtrate all cod fractions decreased after 4 day aerobic pretreatment and 12 day anaerobic treatment compositions shown in table 1 i and ii for aeraob no significant inhibition was observed with the pretreated filtrate indicating the original loss of aeraob activity was most likely related to slowly biodegradable cod fig 1a e for anaob however there was no clear relation between biodegradable cod and activity loss as anaob were still totally inhibited when exposed to more than 30 filtrate fig 1b f to further identify the potential inhibitors on aeraob and possible remedies to avoid such compounds additional pretreatments were performed based on the biological 1 2 or chemical nature 3 4 5 of the activity limiting compounds 1 micronutrient addition 2 six month filtrate storage 4 c 3 coagulation precipitation through iron or zinc addition 4 extraction using hexane 5 sorption of specific organics on biochar and activated carbon adding extra micronutrients in the filtrate did not mitigate the activity loss table 2 indicating that the filtrate composition did not cause growth limitation for the aeraob after six month storage the filtrate showed an inhibition of 39 0 0 5 similar to the fresh filtrate indicating that biodegradable organic fraction underwent few changes during storage as for the pretreatments chemically removing the particular organic fraction no significant impact was observed for the precipitation with iron or zinc extraction with solvent or sorption on biochar table 2 interestingly sorption on activated carbon showed a clear potential of removing the inhibitory compounds for aeraob furthermore the impact of activated carbon on alleviating anaob inhibition was also demonstrated decreasing the inhibition significantly from 42 6 to 2 6 at 20 of volume exposure 3 3 impact of dewatering efficiency to understand the impact of colloidal and particulate cod fractions and to examine the optimal dewatering conditions changes in flocculant polymer flopam dose were tested table 1 iii along with dosage variations in polydadmac or fecl3 as coagulants table 1 iv and v opd of the flocculant polymer was around 10 g flopam kg sludge ts and no improvement in dewatering was observed with a further increase in polymer dose fig 2 a a coagulant polydadmac or fecl3 was added to differentially capture particulate and colloidal fractions dosing polydadmac and fecl3 in addition to 10 g flopam kg sludge ts significantly improved the filtrate quality by capturing more particulate and colloidal cod fig 2 b c polydadmac captured the large colloids efficiently reducing codcoll l from around 500 to 155 mg cod l but could not efficiently capture the small colloids fig 2b table 1 iv fecl3 captured both large and small colloids resulting around 200 mg cod l of small colloids from a dose of 2 g polydadmac kg sludge ts and 70 g fecl3 kg sludge ts onwards no additional improvement was observed fig 2 b c the biological impact of the presence absence of these coagulant dosages was therefore tested in the subsequent microbial activity tests for aeraob dewatering without coagulants i e using only flopam during dewatering yielded a filtrate composition with around 1200 mg codpart l 500 mg codcoll l l and 400 mg codcoll s l fig 2a the lowest aeraob inhibition 13 8 was obtained at an optimal flopam dose of 10 g flopam kg sludge ts fig 3 a underdosing of polymer 7 g flopam kg sludge ts led to an increase in particulate and colloidal cod content in the filtrate and an aeraob inhibition of 36 7 8 9 however overdosing 14 g flopam kg sludge ts also lowered aeraob rates by 31 4 7 9 which might have been caused by the presence of residual polymer potentially creating oxygen uptake limitation due to diffusion resistance fig 3a adding coagulant only improved the aeraob activity in the case of polydadmac the addition of polydadmac efficiently captured the large colloidal fraction as indicated above lowering the aeraob inhibition to a minimum for filtrate from unstable full scale thp ad operation fig 3c table 1 iv v a similar experiment was performed under stable ad performance as shown in fig 3c as a lower large colloidal fraction was automatically obtained under stable ad table 1 iv v aeraob rates were not improved significantly fig 3c though fecl3 captured both large and small colloids no clear improvement in the aeraob activity was observed fig 3c which might relate to the potential impact of excess fecl3 in the filtrate therefore assuming 10 of the dosed fecl3 would remain in the filtrate an additional batch test was performed by adding 333 mg fecl3 l to filtrate only dewatered by flocculant polymer dose higher aeraob activity loss at fecl3 dosing was observed 34 10 compared to 21 4 activity loss when exposed to filtrate only dosed by flopam confirming the hypothesis of harmful residual fecl3 as the previous experiments optimized flopam dose before coagulant dose polydadmac this was reverted in an additional experiment results in fig 2b pointed at 2 g polydadmac kg sludge ts as a minimum to improve the capture efficiency of large colloidal cod additional dewatering tests showed that the presence of this coagulant level increased the capture efficiency for particulate and colloidal matter increased enabling to lower the flocculant dose fig 4 a b indeed the capture efficiency of large colloids increased to 70 80 at total polymer dose of 6 2 g polymer kg sludge ts i e containing 4 2 g flopam g sludge ts fig 4b however in the absence of polydadmac about 9 g flopam kg sludge ts was needed to achieve a similar effect fig 4a for anaob in all dewatering tests no substantial improvements on anaob rates were achieved fig 3b d indicating that particulate and colloidal cod potentially did not play a major role in anaob inhibition 3 4 model based mechanisms of lowered activities in order to identify the mechanisms lowering aeraob and anaob activities different model types were fitted to the data obtained from the batch experiments as only short term testing was performed in this study the focus was on identification of direct inhibition impacts k i impacts and diffusion impacts k s impacts model class 1 was based on direct inhibitors i assuming diffusion limitations were independent of the inhibitor cod fractionating was not considered i codtot the conventional monod approach was used in model 1a s eq 1 while model 1b incorporated a minimum function yielding full impact of the rate limiting step s eq 2 supplementary material s2 and s3 model 1a estimated k i values of 1519 155 and 269 32 mg codtot l for aeraob and anaob respectively table 3 fig 5 with model 1b slightly lower k i values were obtained of 1282 122 and 258 30 mg codtot l for aeraob and anaob respectively comparing the goodness of fit of both models the conventional approach model 1a was found superior to the minimum model model 1b as the latter yielded higher tse mse and rse table 3 in model class 2 next to direct inhibitors i also diffusional inhibitors id were taken into account as compounds influencing the diffusion of substrates and direct inhibitors to perform a preliminary screening as to which cod fraction corresponds to which inhibitor type pca was performed using all batch test data this revealed that the four cod fractions could be categorized in two or three classes with a differential impact on aeraob and anaob activities either coddiss codcoll s vs codcoll l codpart or coddiss codcoll s vs codcoll l vs codpart fig s 1 soluble and small colloidal cod were grouped as one fraction and considered to only cause direct inhibition i coddiss codcoll s for large colloidal and particulate cod an impact of the diffusion resistance was anticipated either lumped into one inhibitor in model 2a id codpart codcoll l s eq 3 or treated as separate inhibitors in model 2b id 1 codpart id 2 codcoll l s eq 4 supplementary material s4 and s5 when implementing model 2a s eq 3 for aeraob the estimated parameters indicated a major sensitivity to compounds causing diffusional resistance as the k i value was considerably lower compared to model 1 and as k i d was considerably lower than k i table 3 however despite a slightly lower tse model 2a did not render a better fit than model 1 as mse increased and the f test showed no significant improvement p 0 05 for model 2b discriminating between the individual contributions by particulate and large colloidal organics a relatively high k i d value was obtained for codpart and a low value for codcoll l indicating that the latter was mainly causing the diffusion resistance model 2b provided the best fit for aeraob inhibition as obtained tse and mse were the lowest and the f test showed significant improvement compared to models 1 and 2a p 0 05 another model fitting was performed by considering small colloidal cod as a diffusional impactor data not shown the results predicted a k i for codcoll s of 2744 405 mg cod l a value considerably above the maximum observed concentration of small colloidal cod in thp ad filtrate it can therefore be concluded that codcoll s did not limit substrate diffusion for anaob the direct only inhibition models did not show improvement of including a minimum function model 1b as tse and mse did not lower compared to model 1a table 3 furthermore the inclusion of diffusional limitation in model 2 yielded no significant improvement in fit as shown by the f tests p 0 05 table 3 models 2a and 2b estimated relatively low and high values for kid and kind respectively indicating indeed that diffusion resistance was limited table 3 4 discussion 4 1 organics inhibiting aeraob thp ad filtrate caused direct aeraob inhibition linked to biodegradable dissolved organic compounds excluding acetate the model however indicated aeraob were less sensitive to soluble compounds than anaob with an estimated k i for coddiss coll s about 4 times above the one for aeraob the aeraob inhibition could be mitigated by extended biological treatment aerobic or anaerobic or activated carbon adsorption the latter process is widely used to adsorb polar compounds for instance in soil remediation removing hydrophobic organic contaminants and polychlorinated biphenyls hale et al 2013 marchal et al 2013 vasilyeva et al 2006 it is unclear why biochar could not overcome aeraob inhibition though it has similar properties in theory each of the three options could be implemented to lower the biodegradable cod content in thp ad filtrate i by treating the filtrate aerobically e g in a trickling filter ii by extending the srt in ad e g with a post digester or iii by installing an activated carbon process however such pretreament approaches require an additional unit process and are not practically feasible or cost effective preferentially the inhibition can be prevented or cured by altering the operation of the existing processes e g by increasing the aerobic srt or the dilution of the filtrate additional clues are expected from a deeper analytical characterization of differences in dissolved organics in thp ad vs conventional ad filtrate besides the direct effect the filtrate s organics also indirectly lowered the aeraob activity with particulates and large colloids putatively limiting the diffusion of substrates a clear relationship between the dewatering performance and aeraob activities was shown similar to earlier studies showing the important influence of diffusion on nitrification kinetics in practice for instance in case of an increased solids load to the system during storm events armstrong 2008 shaw et al 2015 stenstrom and poduska 1980 optimizing flocculant polymer dose to reduce residue solids or polymer in thp ad filtrate diminished the aeraob inhibition fig 3a this is in line with observations in full scale operation of sidestream deammonification where a high tss inflow led to decreased turnover rates of aeraob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and restoring of the aeraob activity was achieved after doubling the aeration time and increasing the do concentration of up to 1 mg o2 l joss et al 2011 in contrast to the under dosed filtrate the polymer residue in the over dosed filtrate can cause foaming issues and potentially diffusion limitations as observed in 30 of the plants lackner et al 2014 in contrast to the under dosed filtrate the polymer residue in the over dosed filtrate can cause foaming issues and potentially diffusion limitations as observed in 30 of the plants lackner et al 2014 the impact of foaming on reactor performance created substrate intake limitation and the recovery usually takes about1 5 days confirming that the system is not inhibited the aeraob inhibition from large colloids could be significantly prevented although not completely removed by optimizing the dewatering stage i e adding coagulant to better capture this fraction especially during unstable digestion fig 3c model 2b showed that separating the particle sizes 0 45 1 μm vs 1μm led to a relatively low k i value for large colloidal cod 7 6 1 3 mg codcoll l l pinpointing this fraction as a key inhibitor class to aeraob compared to the typical content of large colloids in thp ad filtrate 211 151 mg codcoll l l the low k i indicated that the large colloidal fraction was the rate limiting factor under high levels of colloidal matter oxygen transfer efficiency decreased resulting in limited do availability and consequently a poor nitrification performance germain et al 2007 wu et al 2013 li et al 2018 observed the decrease of oxygen availability lowered substrate conversion in biofilms due to the high loadings of particulate organics in wastewater which resulted in 20 70 of dissolved oxygen flux reduction from the biofilm surface into biofilm matrix coagulants neutralize the negative electric charge on particles and destabilize the forces keeping colloids apart poon and chu 1999 the large colloidal fractions in the case of thp ad filtrate had more impact on aeraob flocs possible due to the relative small aeraob floc size compared to the anaob granules han et al 2016 vlaeminck et al 2010 the diffusion impact on the aeraob containing flocs was relatively dominant creating diffusion limitation of substrates e g oxygen or ammonium rather than directly impacting the cell s metabolism or growth rate negatively the curative strategy of increasing the do level helps to overcome diffusion limitation and improve ammonium removal rates as confirmed by zhang et al 2016 additionally unlike the inhibition related to the soluble factions the lowered aeraob rates caused by diffusion limitation are usually transient reversible and easy to notice adequate trace nutrient concentrations including metal ions and vitamins are necessary to have a diverse microbial community thrive in an activated sludge plant especially when treating certain types of industrial wastewater burgess et al 1999 jefferson et al 2001 klein et al 2013 and nifong et al 2013 observed a full scale sidestream deammonification system instability due to the micronutrient limitations the activity test in this study showed that the biomass inhibition was not related to acute micronutrient deficiency table 2 long term operation is however necessary to validate if adding extra bioavailable micronutrients might be helpful to compensate for the decreased growth rates and or increased decay rates 4 2 organics inhibiting anaob for anaob the kinetic tests indicated that soluble organics in thp ad filtrate were the primary source of inhibition potentially related to the nonbiodegradable fraction concentrations of dissolved organics were tightly related to thp and ad operation stability however due to the multitude and complexity of the organics it is an analytical challenge to identify the specific inhibitors dwyer et al 2008 reported an increased presence of recalcitrant organic compounds in thp ad filtrate was related to the pretreatment at an excessively high temperature higher than 170 190 c which led to significant changes in a generation of recalcitrant n and cod meanwhile these soluble inhibitory organics were not easily removed via aerobic and anaerobic treatment as the remaining anaob activity was lower than 80 fig 1f gupta et al 2015 showed that organic matter in the thp ad filtrate could not be efficiently removed by aerobic biological treatment the biodegradable organics related to the digester instability increased inhibition and can be caused by variable e g shock loading resulting in partial sludge degradation and associated accumulation of surface active substances and subsequent foaming issues ganidi et al 2009 the total nitrogen removal rate in a lab scale sidestream deammonification system decreased with 90 resulting in substantial nitrite accumulation 20 mg no2 n l when fed with filtrate containing increased soluble organics 5934 680 mg cod l caused by digester overloading zhang et al 2016 an increase in vfa concentration usually occurs as an indicator and consequence of unstable ad chen et al 2008 iv 2003 as also seen in this study with an increase of soluble cod from 2762 mg cod l to 6600 mg cod l in the filtrate with around 35 of the increase due to acetate however actual vfa concentrations in unstable filtrate were a lot lower than the inhibitory levels for anaob observed in previous studies dapena mora et al 2004 molinuevo et al 2009 in comparison to our acetate value of 1 3 g cod l in unstable thp ad filtrate kindaichi et al 2016 observed that concentrations up to 3 2 g cod l of acetate had no effects on anaob the acetate spike test at 1 3 g cod l also confirmed no impact on the anaob activity fig 1d model runs confirmed the sensitivity of anaob towards soluble cod the estimated k i of 250 mg cod l is 4 times lower than the toxicity level at 800 mg cod l observed in the long term sbr operation zhang et al 2016 this higher level can relate to an underloaded anaob inventory resulting from efficient anaob retention in the sbr however once inhibition has been observed in sidestream deammonification it usually takes the biomass a month to recover therefore longer srt and good anaob retention are necessary to compensate for the decreased growth rates furthermore even with actions taken in thp and ad improvements in filtrate composition lag because of the long srt in ad thus monitoring the digesters performance is important and upon instability manifested by less methane foaming more vfa and ammonia etc it is necessary to dilute the filtrate more the full scale deammonification system at dc water is designed to treat thp ad at a 1 1 dilution ratio with water zhang et al 2016 the potential drawback of a higher dilution is the temperature loss especially in winter time 5 conclusion this paper investigated four organic fractions in the filtrate from anaerobic digestion preceded by thermal hydrolysis to identify specific inhibition compounds and mechanisms for aeraob and anaob furthermore the findings were confronted with a global mechanistic inhibition model aeraob were inhibited directly from dissolved organics and indirectly with particulate and colloidal fractions causing diffusion limitation the latter can be resolved through optimization of the dewatering process in terms of flocculant and coagulant polymer dosing to obtain a better capture of the colloidal fraction to the sludge cake an inhibition model including diffusion resistance based on the porter equation showed the best fit with the experimental data and highlighted that aeraob were highly sensitive to large colloids for anaob it was found activity was mainly impacted by dissolved organics in the filtrate tightly linked to the thp and digester performance not by changes in the
