18485,hydroxyl radicals oh initiated degradation is an important process governing fate of aquatic organic micropollutants omps however rate constants for aqueous reaction of omps with oh k oh are available only for a limited number of omps which complicates fate assessment of omps furthermore molecular structures of many omps contain ionizable groups and the omps may dissociate into different anionic cationic species with different reactivity towards oh therefore it is of importance to determine k oh of ionizable omps and to develop quantitative structure activity relationship qsar models for predicting k oh of omps at different ionization forms herein k oh values of 9 fluoroquinolones fqs and 11 sulfonamides sas at 3 dissociation forms fq fq fq sa0 sa sa were determined by competition kinetics experiments a qsar model using theoretical molecular structural descriptors was subsequently developed the qsar model successfully corroborated previous experimental results exhibited good statistical performance and is capable to predict k oh for fqs and sas with different dissociation forms at environmentally relevant ph conditions as organic ions have rarely been included in previous qsar studies the newly developed model that covers both neutral molecules and ions is of significance for future qsar development as well as fate assessment of ionizable omps graphical abstract image

products ppcps have gained increasing concern as aquatic organic micropollutants omps in recent years oberoi et al 2019 schwarzenbach et al 2006 among ppcps antibiotics that are widely used in medicine aquaculture and livestock husbandry have been detected in various aqueous systems e g surface water liu et al 2018 groundwater boy roura et al 2018 wastewater treatment plants ruan et al 2019 since antibiotics can induce bacterial resistance at environmental concentrations gullberg et al 2011 and even result in the emergence of superbugs woodward 2010 thus posing a threat to ecosystems as well as humans environmental fate of antibiotics is becoming an issue of increasing concern previous studies indicated that reaction with reactive species such as hydroxyl radical oh singlet oxygen and triplet excited states of chromophoric dissolved organic matter in aqueous systems is an important pathway governing fate of omps vione et al 2014 in aquatic environments reactive species are commonly generated as a consequence of photochemical reactions electron transfer or energy transfer reactions burns et al 2012 among various reactive species oh is the most powerful reactant rosario ortiz et al 2010 in natural waters oh is mainly produced by photochemical reactions of dissolved organic matter nitrate nitrite and transition metal complexes burns et al 2012 or by processes occuring in dark e g oxidation by oxygen of reduced dissolved organic matter or oxidative attack of h2o2 on dissolved reduced metals such as fe ii in hypolimnion waters gligorovski et al 2015 soils page et al 2013 and subsurface sediments containing oxic anoxic interfaces tong et al 2016 with its concentrations ranging from 10 17 to 10 15 mol l luo et al 2017 in aritificial treatment e g advanced oxidation processes facilities oh is usually generated at sufficient concentrations by coupled chemical and or physical techniques gligorovski et al 2015 such as h2o2 fe ii or h2o2 fe iii fenton h2o2 catalyst or peroxide catalyst fenton like uv h2o2 ozonation pulse radiolysis and ultrasound with relatively low selectivity oh is capable to oxidize a wide variety of omps gligorovski et al 2015 as to antibiotics oh attack e g addition to double bonds or aromatic rings h abstraction electron transfer h transfer can lead to a proportional loss of the primary antibacterial activity for parent compounds ge et al 2015 keen and linden 2013 via interrupting specific hydrogen bonding charge interactions or oxidizing functional moieties responsible for the antibacterial potency for the reaction with oh the rate constant k oh is a significant parameter in determining environmental persistence and fate of omps therefore it is of importance to acquire k oh values for omps such as antibiotics nevertheless k oh values for most antibiotics are not available moreover molecular structures of many antibiotics contain ionizable functional groups such as cooh oh and nh2 in aquatic environments these antibiotics may exist at different dissociation forms it is known that different ionized species of omps have distinct reactivity with reactive species wei et al 2013 xie et al 2013 therefore it is of great importance to determine k oh values of ionizable antibiotics at different ionization forms generally k oh values of omps can be determined by different experimental methods buxton et al 1988 wols and hofman caris 2012 including direct e g pulse radiolysis flash photolysis and indirect methods competition kinetics as the direct determination is limited by availability of sophisticated equipment the simpler and cheaper competition kinetics method has received a widespread application shemer et al 2006 there are two commonly used systems to generate oh in competition kinetics determinations fenton boreen et al 2004 2005 and uv h2o2 systems ge et al 2019 xie et al 2013 the fenton system is only suitable for acidic conditions whereas the uv h2o2 system is applicable to a wide range of ph conditions to date k oh values have only been determined for dozens of antibiotics at fixed ph and are available only for no more than hundreds of omps boreen et al 2004 2005 buxton et al 1988 guo et al 2018 li et al 2018 santoke et al 2009 wols and hofman caris 2012 wols et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 it seems impossible to experimentally determine k oh for all omps since the experimental determination is costly and laborious instead quantitative structure activity relationship qsar models on which the oecd has issued guidelines oecd 2007 should be developed for k oh prediction currently several qsar models for aqueous k oh prediction borhani et al 2016 huang et al 2012 jin et al 2015 kušić et al 2009 li et al 2018 luo et al 2017 monod and doussin 2008 sudhakaran and amy 2013 wang et al 2009 have been developed however most of the existing models cover a limited number of omps especially antibiotics in the applicability domains and do not consider the dissociation forms thus cannot be employed to predict the aqueous k oh of dissociated antibiotics in this study two groups of commonly used and frequently detected antibiotics fluoroquinolones fqs and sulfonamides sas oberoi et al 2019 were selected as model compounds k oh values for 9 fqs and 11 sas each antibiotic has two available pk a values at zwitterionic neutral cationic and anionic forms fq fq fq sa0 sa sa were determined by the competition kinetics experiments based on the experimental k oh data a qsar model was constructed using theoretical molecular structural descriptors and was verified with experimental data 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and materials sources of the chemicals used in the experiment are described in the supplementary material sm molecular structures for the 9 fqs and 11 sas are shown in fig s1 all the chemicals as received were at least 98 purity and their solutions were prepared using ultrapure water filtered with an okp ultrapure water system shanghai lakecore instrument co china 2 2 competition kinetics experiments for the competition kinetics method oh initiated degradation is assumed to be the only significant loss pathway of target reactant the reactant competes for oh with a reference compound whose k oh value k oh p under identical conditions is known einschlag et al 2003 xie et al 2013 the bimolecular rate constant of the reactant k oh r can be calculated by 1 k oh r k r k p k oh p ln r t r 0 ln p t p 0 k oh p where k r and k p are apparent degradation rate constants for the reactant and reference compound respectively r and p are concentrations of the reactant and reference compound respectively a plot of ln r t r 0 versus ln p t p 0 gives a straight line passing through the origin whose slope gives the ratio k r k p in this study acetophenone k oh p 5 9 109 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 was adopted as the reference compound and initial concentrations of the antibiotics and acetophenone were 20 μm kinetics experiments were performed with an xpa 1 merry go round photochemical reactor nanjing xujiang technology co china using an uv h2o2 system to generate oh a 500 w hg lamp surrounded by 340 nm cut off filters was used as the light source fig s2 under which oh was sufficiently generated and direct photolysis of acetophenone was negligible xie et al 2013 inside the reactor quartz tubes rotate around the light source ensuring homogeneous irradiation of the solution 50 ml in each tube fig s3 to determine k oh for different dissociation species three ph conditions table s1 were set under which the antibiotics mainly present at a certain dissociation form the ph adjustment methods and h2o2 concentrations are detained in the sm direct photolysis rate constants k d for the antibiotics were determined to correct for direct photolysis for each antibiotic under a certain ph condition a control experiment with the same irradiation condition but without h2o2 was performed fig s3 to determine k d values moreover light screening effects of h2o2 and the antibiotics were corrected using a factor f detailed in the sm since the light screening can decrease irradiance absorbance of the antibiotics and reduce their direct photolysis rates shemer et al 2006 finally the apparent k oh r for a target antibiotic at a specific ph condition k oh a was obtained by 2 k oh a k r f k d k p k oh p dark controls with the presence of h2o2 but without the irradiation were also performed to evaluate oxidation of the antibiotics by h2o2 all the experiments were repeated six times at room temperature 22 1 c and k oh a values were reported from average of the six replicates with their experimental errors evaluated by the t test detailed in the sm 2 3 calculation of k oh for different dissociation forms an sa molecule contains one amine group and one amide group thus exhibiting two pk a values and three dissociation forms cationic form sa neutral form sa0 and anionic form sa an fq molecule contains one carboxylic group and three nitrogen sites possibly exhibiting four pk a values at maximum many previous studies provided only two pk a values and three dissociation forms cationic form fq zwitterionic form fq and anionic form fq due to difficulty in determination of the pk a values babic et al 2007 therefore in this study each antibiotic has two pk a values table s1 and three dissociation forms fig s4 distributions of the different dissociation species detailed in the sm as a function of ph are shown in fig s5 three ph values table s1 for each antibiotic were selected based on the distribution for the antibiotics at the lower medium and higher experimental ph conditions table s1 the species that present the highest proportions are their cationic zwitterionic neutral and anionic forms respectively at a given ph the k oh a value can be assumed to be sum of the k oh for the different co existing species k oh s wei et al 2013 xie et al 2013 i e 3 k oh a δ 1 k oh s 1 δ 2 k oh s 2 δ 3 k oh s 3 where δ 1 δ 2 δ 3 are proportions of the three dissociation species fig s5 and k oh s 1 k oh s 2 k oh s 3 are their corresponding k oh s values by solving three combined equations of eq 3 at different ph values the k oh s values were obtained which were also reported from average of the six replicates with their experimental errors evaluated by the t test 2 4 analytical methods at appropriate time intervals a sample 1 0 ml was withdrawn and totally 8 samples were withdrawn from each tube during the irradiation according to previous studies shemer et al 2006 xie et al 2013 the small volume decrease caused by the sampling has little impacts on degradation kinetics of the reactants after addition of 0 5 ml methanol as a oh quencher the sample was analyzed using an agilent 1260 hplc the analysis was performed on a sb c18 column 2 1 mm 150 mm 3 5 μm particle size with a fluorescence detector fld for the fqs and an xdb c18 column 3 0 mm 150 mm 3 5 μm particle size with a diode array detector dad for the sas acetophenone was analyzed on the same column with the corresponding antibiotics and detected by the dad the hplc analytical conditions are detailed in table s2 2 5 qsar modeling of k oh s a qsar model was developed on the basis of the 60 experimental k oh s values for the 20 antibiotics at cationic zwitterionic fq neutral sa and anionic forms the data points were randomly split into a training set and a validation set with a ratio of 3 1 the molecular structures of the cationic zwitterionic neutral and anionic forms of the antibiotics were optimized at the m06 2x zhao and truhlar 2008 level in conjunction with the 6 31 g d p basis set using the gaussian 09 program suite frisch et al 2009 and 14 quantum chemical descriptors table s3 were calculated accordingly based on the optimized structures dragon dragon ver 6 0 2014 molecular structural descriptors were calculated and employed after excluding the descriptors with missing values or with high pair wise correlations i e one of any two descriptors having a correlation coefficient greater than 0 99 following the oecd guidelines oecd 2007 the qsar model was developed by stepwise multiple linear regression using spss version 16 0 and the applicability domain was assessed by a williams plot netzeva et al 2005 as detailed in the sm 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation kinetics at different ph conditions fig s6 shows apparent degradation kinetics of the 20 antibiotics it can be observed that loss of the antibiotics is not significant in the dark control 3 implying that direct oxidation of the antibiotics by h2o2 is negligible however the controls with irradiation and absence of h2o2 show that direct photolysis of some antibiotics is significant fig s6 indicating necessity to correct for direct photolysis the determined ƒ values table s4 are 0 84 indicating necessity for correcting for the light screening effects of h2o2 and the antibiotics the determined k oh a values under the different ph conditions are listed in table s5 all the k oh a values for the fqs except for lomefloxacin and difloxacin k oh a 1010 m 1s 1 are higher than those for the sas 1010 m 1s 1 k oh a 109 m 1s 1 as can be seen from fig 1 for the fqs k oh a is the highest at neutral ph ph 7 or 7 5 and the lowest at acidic ph ph 3 for the sas k oh a at ph 3 5 6 ph2 in table s1 is the lowest the k oh a values of the sas except for sulfadimethoxine at ph 9 11 ph3 in table s1 are higher than those at the other two ph conditions while k oh a of sulfadimethoxine at ph 2 is the highest it deserves mentioning that most previous studies determined k oh a values of fqs and sas at a single ph boreen et al 2004 2005 santoke et al 2009 zhang et al 2016 for most of the antibiotics under study this work is the first to determine their k oh a at different ph values 3 2 k oh s values for the different dissociation forms of the antibiotics the determined k oh s values fig 2 table s6 for most of the sas are similar to those of some pollutants e g k oh a 4 2 109 m 1s 1 for nitrobenzene einschlag et al 2003 and k oh a 2 6 109 m 1s 1 for atrazine buxton et al 1988 while the k oh s values for the cationic form of sulfadimethoxine the anionic form of sulfaguanidine and the fqs except for lomefloxacin and difloxacin are 1 order of magnitude higher k oh s 1010 m 1s 1 than the values mentioned above for the fqs and most of the sas it can be seen that variation of the k oh s values for the three dissociation forms fig 2 corresponds with variation of the k oh a values at the different ph conditions fig 1 as shown in fig 2 the zwitterionic forms of all the fqs degrade the fastest while their cationic forms degrade the slowest for the sas the k oh s values for the neutral species are lower than those for the cationic and anionic forms additionally sulfamerazine sulfamethoxazole sulfameter sulfadiazine sulfamethizole sulfamethazine sulfapyridine and sulfaguanidine show a similar tendency of their anionic forms presenting the highest k oh s values among the three forms while the k oh s values for sa forms of sulfachloropyridazine sulfathiazole and sulfadimethoxine are higher than those for the other two forms for most of the antibiotics under study this study is the first to report the k oh s values for the different protonated states which enriches the k oh database of omps and is of importance for the fate assessment of the antibiotics in previous studies k oh a values of several sas were determined at ph 3 using the fenton system boreen et al 2004 2005 or at ph 7 using the uv h2o2 system zhang et al 2016 in this study the k oh a values for the sas were determined neither at ph 3 or ph 7 to compare the different sets of k oh a values the k oh a values of the sas at ph 3 and ph 7 were calculated by eq 3 with the k oh s values table s6 it is known that measured k oh a values vary in consequence of different experimental conditions shemer et al 2006 as can be seen from fig 3 and table s7 there is a slight difference between the k oh a values of the sas at ph 3 in the current study and the studies of boreen et al 2004 2005 the k oh a values of sulfamethazine and sulfamerazine in the current study are approximately equal to or a bit higher than those determined by boreen et al 2004 2005 respectively while the k oh a values of the other sas are a bit lower than the values determined previously it can also be found from previous studies huber et al 2003 packer et al 2003 pereira et al 2007 that for a same compound e g naproxen clofibric acid ibuprofen k oh a determined by the uv h2o2 system differs either higher or lower from that determined by the fenton system thus the difference between the k oh a values determined in the current and the previous studies may mainly attribute to the different experimental systems the fenton system in the studies of boreen et al 2004 2005 versus the uv h2o2 system in the current study to evaluate potential errors of the determined k oh a ratio factors rf between the k oh a values in the current study and in the previous studies were calculated as can be seen from table s7 all the rf values at ph 3 are 2 which is within the most acceptable range of rf values 3 for measured k oh a values by competition kinetics from different laboratories von sonntag and von gunten 2012 compared with the k oh a values at ph 7 determined by zhang et al 2016 using the uv h2o2 system the k oh a values in the current study are generally lower fig 3 and table s7 according to shemer et al 2006 and huber et al 2003 the selection of reference compounds is also an important factor that induces errors of the competition kinetics results in the studies of zhang et al 2016 nitrobenzene was employed as a reference compound it can be found from previous studies armbrust 2000 baeza and knappe 2011 shemer et al 2006 zhang et al 2016 that k oh a values of many omps e g sulfadiazine molinate diuron determined using nitrobenzene as the reference compound with the uv h2o2 system are generally higher than those employing other reference compounds e g acetophenone molinate atrazine para chlorobenzoic acid as can be concluded from table s8 thus the use of acetophenone as the reference compound in the current study may lead to comparatively lower determined k oh a values than the corresponding values at ph 7 determined by zhang et al 2016 nevertheless all the rf values at ph 7 are 2 table s7 and within the range of rf values for measured k oh a von sonntag and von gunten 2012 moreover the logk oh a values at ph 3 and ph 7 in the current study table s7 fall within the range of the previously determined logk oh a values 0 3 log units fig s7 therefore it can be concluded that the k oh a values of the sas at ph 3 and ph 7 agree with those reported previously boreen et al 2004 2005 zhang et al 2016 3 3 qsar model for k oh s based on the determined k oh s values table s6 a qsar model was developed for logk oh s of the antibiotic species 4 logk oh s 9 724 0 2180 c 006 0 6650 q c 0 01300 μ n tr 45 r 2 adj 0 805 rmse tr 0 228 q 2 loo 0 778 q 2 boot 0 770 n ext 15 r 2 ext 0 820 q 2 ext 0 816 rmse ext 0 197 where n tr and n ext are the number of the data points in the training set and validation set respectively r 2 adj and r 2 ext are adjusted and external determination coefficients respectively q 2 ext is external validation coefficient rmse tr and rmse ext are root mean square errors for the training set and validation set respectively q 2 loo and q 2 boot are the leave one out cross validated and bootstrap method repeated 5000 times at each step 20 of objects are left out from the training set coefficients respectively some of the parameters are detailed in the sm the model has three molecular structural descriptors the dragon descriptor c 006 the number of ch2rx fragments the most positive net atomic charge on c atoms q c and the molecular dipole moment μ values of the descriptors are listed in table s9 variance inflation factors norusis 1997 for these descriptors are all 10 table s10 indicating that these descriptors are free of multicollinearities this model possesses high values of r 2 adj q 2 loo q 2 boot r 2 ext and q 2 ext and low values of rmse tr as well as rmse ext indicating the qsar model has high goodness of fit robustness and predictive performance plot of predicted versus experimental logk oh s values fig s8 shows that the absolute values of the residuals were 0 6 log units indicating that the predicted logk oh s values agree well with the experimental values the applicability domain of the model is characterized in fig s9 for all the species in the training and validation sets the absolute values of standardized residual defined in the sm are smaller than 3 suggesting there are no outliers in addition the leverage values of all the species in the training and validation sets are lower than the warning leverage value h 0 27 indicating none of the compounds is particularly influential in the model space and thus the training set has good representativeness therefore the developed qsar model meets all the criteria set by the oecd for qsar models to be applied for regulatory purposes oecd 2007 and it can be employed to predict aqueous k oh s for other fq and sa species within the applicability domain the t values of the t test for the three descriptors are listed in table s10 among the descriptors c 006 is the most statistically significant t 6 526 with a positive coefficient defined as the number of specific atom types in a molecule and calculated on the basis of molecular composition as well as atom connectivities ghose et al 1998 viswanadhan et al 1989 c 006 encodes the number of ch2rx r group linked through c atom x electronegative atoms such as o n s p se halogens fragments since oh reactions can occur on functional groups with reactive h atoms via h abstraction minakata et al 2009 chemicals with ch2rx groups may be more easily attacked by oh leading to their higher oh reactivity the quantum chemical descriptor q c is the second most statistically significant t 4 153 correlating negatively with logk oh s with a more positive formal charge the c atom tends to possess poorer ability to donate electrons since oh is an electrophile chemicals with these c atoms can be hardly attacked by oh thus leading to low oh reactivity μ encodes displacement with respect to centers of positive and negative charges and carries information about charge distribution in a molecule luo et al 2017 the positive coefficient of μ indicates that a chemical with a higher μ value is more inclined to react with oh the developed qsar model is capable to predict the aqueous k oh s of fqs and sas within the applicability domain and thus k oh a under realistic environmental ph conditions to further verify predictability of the model sulfisoxazole was selected as a case since the k oh a values of this compound have been measured at ph 3 boreen et al 2004 and ph 7 zhang et al 2016 the k oh a values that were calculated based on eq 3 from k oh s for the 3 dissociation forms table s11 predicted by the qsar model are 1 44 109 m 1s 1 at ph 3 and 2 68 109 m 1s 1 at ph 7 table s12 prediction accuracy of qsars relies on data used for training the models since most of the k oh a values determined in the current study are generally lower than the corresponding values determined in the previous studies table s7 it is not surprising that the k oh a values for sulfisoxazole predicted by the qsar model are lower than those reported previously table s12 nevertheless it can be seen that the predicted k oh a values for sulfisoxazole and those reported previously are within a same order of magnitude 109 m 1s 1 and the predicted k oh a values show a trend of increase from ph 3 to ph 7 which is similar to that for the experimental values lee and von gunten 2012 reported that rate constants predicted by qsars for advanced oxidation processes have a potential error of a factor of up to 9 ratio factors between the k oh a in previous studies and the k oh a predicted by the current qsar at ph 3 and ph 7 are 4 57 and 2 74 respectively table s12 and the differences between the previously reported and the qsar predicted logk oh a values are 0 7 log units therefore the current qsar model has a satisfactory performance for k oh prediction it deserves mentioning that to date most qsar models on environmental chemicals have been constructed for non ionized organic molecules the qsar model in this study encompasses both organic non ionized molecules and anions cations which indicates that it is possible to construct qsars for organic anions cations the development of qsars that cover organic anions cations in the training validation sets is of great importance since the molecular structures of many emerging omps carry various ionizable functional groups and these pollutants can ionize in the aquatic environment or in engineered facilities like waste water treatment plants from this point of view this study exemplifies how to develop qsars that can predict environmental behavior of organic ions nevertheless it needs to be pointed out that the current study investigated only two categories of antibiotics with three protonated states more efforts are needed to develop similar qsars that cover more organic ionizable molecules and protonated states 4 conclusions the 20 antibiotics investigated can react rapidly with oh k oh a or k oh s 109 m 1s 1 and their reactivity towards oh varies among the different dissociation forms for the fluoroquinolones the zwitterionic forms and the cationic forms possess the highest and lowest k oh s values respectively while for the sulfonamides the neutral forms possess the lowest k oh s values the established qsar model exhibits satisfactory statistical performance and may pave a new way for predicting the aqueous k oh values of antibiotics with different protonated states according to the model the number of ch2rx fragments the most positive net atomic charge on c atoms and the molecular dipole moment are the main factors governing oh reactivity of the investigated antibiotics increases in the number of ch2rx fragments and the values of molecular dipole moment lead to an increase of the logk oh s values while increases in the values of the most positive net atomic charge on c atoms lead to a decrease of the logk oh s values declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

prediction currently several qsar models for aqueous k oh prediction borhani et al 2016 huang et al 2012 jin et al 2015 kušić et al 2009 li et al 2018 luo et al 2017 monod and doussin 2008 sudhakaran and amy 2013 wang et al 2009 have been developed however most of the existing models cover a limited number of omps especially antibiotics in the applicability domains and do not consider the dissociation forms thus cannot be employed to predict the aqueous k oh of dissociated antibiotics in this study two groups of commonly used and frequently detected antibiotics fluoroquinolones fqs and sulfonamides sas oberoi et al 2019 were selected as model compounds k oh values for 9 fqs and 11 sas each antibiotic has two available pk a values at zwitterionic neutral cationic and anionic forms fq fq fq sa0 sa sa were determined by the competition kinetics experiments based on the experimental k oh data a qsar model was constructed using theoretical molecular structural descriptors and was verified with experimental data 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and materials sources of the chemicals used in the experiment are described in the supplementary material sm molecular structures for the 9 fqs and 11 sas are shown in fig s1 all the chemicals as received were at least 98 purity and their solutions were prepared using ultrapure water filtered with an okp ultrapure water system shanghai lakecore instrument co china 2 2 competition kinetics experiments for the competition kinetics method oh initiated degradation is assumed to be the only significant loss pathway of target reactant the reactant competes for oh with a reference compound whose k oh value k oh p under identical conditions is known einschlag et al 2003 xie et al 2013 the bimolecular rate constant of the reactant k oh r can be calculated by 1 k oh r k r k p k oh p ln r t r 0 ln p t p 0 k oh p where k r and k p are apparent degradation rate constants for the reactant and reference compound respectively r and p are concentrations of the reactant and reference compound respectively a plot of ln r t r 0 versus ln p t p 0 gives a straight line passing through the origin whose slope gives the ratio k r k p in this study acetophenone k oh p 5 9 109 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 was adopted as the reference compound and initial concentrations of the antibiotics and acetophenone were 20 μm kinetics experiments were performed with an xpa 1 merry go round photochemical reactor nanjing xujiang technology co china using an uv h2o2 system to generate oh a 500 w hg lamp surrounded by 340 nm cut off filters was used as the light source fig s2 under which oh was sufficiently generated and direct photolysis of acetophenone was negligible xie et al 2013 inside the reactor quartz tubes rotate around the light source ensuring homogeneous irradiation of the solution 50 ml in each tube fig s3 to determine k oh for different dissociation species three ph conditions table s1 were set under which the antibiotics mainly present at a certain dissociation form the ph adjustment methods and h2o2 concentrations are detained in the sm direct photolysis rate constants k d for the antibiotics were determined to correct for direct photolysis for each antibiotic under a certain ph condition a control experiment with the same irradiation condition but without h2o2 was performed fig s3 to determine k d values moreover light screening effects of h2o2 and the antibiotics were corrected using a factor f detailed in the sm since the light screening can decrease irradiance absorbance of the antibiotics and reduce their direct photolysis rates shemer et al 2006 finally the apparent k oh r for a target antibiotic at a specific ph condition k oh a was obtained by 2 k oh a k r f k d k p k oh p dark controls with the presence of h2o2 but without the irradiation were also performed to evaluate oxidation of the antibiotics by h2o2 all the experiments were repeated six times at room temperature 22 1 c and k oh a values were reported from average of the six replicates with their experimental errors evaluated by the t test detailed in the sm 2 3 calculation of k oh for different dissociation forms an sa molecule contains one amine group and one amide group thus exhibiting two pk a values and three dissociation forms cationic form sa neutral form sa0 and anionic form sa an fq molecule contains one carboxylic group and three nitrogen sites possibly exhibiting four pk a values at maximum many previous studies provided only two pk a values and three dissociation forms cationic form fq zwitterionic form fq and anionic form fq due to difficulty in determination of the pk a values babic et al 2007 therefore in this study each antibiotic has two pk a values table s1 and three dissociation forms fig s4 distributions of the different dissociation species detailed in the sm as a function of ph are shown in fig s5 three ph values table s1 for each antibiotic were selected based on the distribution for the antibiotics at the lower medium and higher experimental ph conditions table s1 the species that present the highest proportions are their cationic zwitterionic neutral and anionic forms respectively at a given ph the k oh a value can be assumed to be sum of the k oh for the different co existing species k oh s wei et al 2013 xie et al 2013 i e 3 k oh a δ 1 k oh s 1 δ 2 k oh s 2 δ 3 k oh s 3 where δ 1 δ 2 δ 3 are proportions of the three dissociation species fig s5 and k oh s 1 k oh s 2 k oh s 3 are their corresponding k oh s values by solving three combined equations of eq 3 at different ph values the k oh s values were obtained which were also reported from average of the six replicates with their experimental errors evaluated by the t test 2 4 analytical methods at appropriate time intervals a sample 1 0 ml was withdrawn and totally 8 samples were withdrawn from each tube during the irradiation according to previous studies shemer et al 2006 xie et al 2013 the small volume decrease caused by the sampling has little impacts on degradation kinetics of the reactants after addition of 0 5 ml methanol as a oh quencher the sample was analyzed using an agilent 1260 hplc the analysis was performed on a sb c18 column 2 1 mm 150 mm 3 5 μm particle size with a fluorescence detector fld for the fqs and an xdb c18 column 3 0 mm 150 mm 3 5 μm particle size with a diode array detector dad for the sas acetophenone was analyzed on the same column with the corresponding antibiotics and detected by the dad the hplc analytical conditions are detailed in table s2 2 5 qsar modeling of k oh s a qsar model was developed on the basis of the 60 experimental k oh s values for the 20 antibiotics at cationic zwitterionic fq neutral sa and anionic forms the data points were randomly split into a training set and a validation set with a ratio of 3 1 the molecular structures of the cationic zwitterionic neutral and anionic forms of the antibiotics were optimized at the m06 2x zhao and truhlar 2008 level in conjunction with the 6 31 g d p basis set using the gaussian 09 program suite frisch et al 2009 and 14 quantum chemical descriptors table s3 were calculated accordingly based on the optimized structures dragon dragon ver 6 0 2014 molecular structural descriptors were calculated and employed after excluding the descriptors with missing values or with high pair wise correlations i e one of any two descriptors having a correlation coefficient greater than 0 99 following the oecd guidelines oecd 2007 the qsar model was developed by stepwise multiple linear regression using spss version 16 0 and the applicability domain was assessed by a williams plot netzeva et al 2005 as detailed in the sm 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation kinetics at different ph conditions fig s6 shows apparent degradation kinetics of the 20 antibiotics it can be observed that loss of the antibiotics is not significant in the dark control 3 implying that direct oxidation of the antibiotics by h2o2 is negligible however the controls with irradiation and absence of h2o2 show that direct photolysis of some antibiotics is significant fig s6 indicating necessity to correct for direct photolysis the determined ƒ values table s4 are 0 84 indicating necessity for correcting for the light screening effects of h2o2 and the antibiotics the determined k oh a values under the different ph conditions are listed in table s5 all the k oh a values for the fqs except for lomefloxacin and difloxacin k oh a 1010 m 1s 1 are higher than those for the sas 1010 m 1s 1 k oh a 109 m 1s 1 as can be seen from fig 1 for the fqs k oh a is the highest at neutral ph ph 7 or 7 5 and the lowest at acidic ph ph 3 for the sas k oh a at ph 3 5 6 ph2 in table s1 is the lowest the k oh a values of the sas except for sulfadimethoxine at ph 9 11 ph3 in table s1 are higher than those at the other two ph conditions while k oh a of sulfadimethoxine at ph 2 is the highest it deserves mentioning that most previous studies determined k oh a values of fqs and sas at a single ph boreen et al 2004 2005 santoke et al 2009 zhang et al 2016 for most of the antibiotics under study this work is the first to determine their k oh a at different ph values 3 2 k oh s values for the different dissociation forms of the antibiotics the determined k oh s values fig 2 table s6 for most of the sas are similar to those of some pollutants e g k oh a 4 2 109 m 1s 1 for nitrobenzene einschlag et al 2003 and k oh a 2 6 109 m 1s 1 for atrazine buxton et al 1988 while the k oh s values for the cationic form of sulfadimethoxine the anionic form of sulfaguanidine and the fqs except for lomefloxacin and difloxacin are 1 order of magnitude higher k oh s 1010 m 1s 1 than the values mentioned above for the fqs and most of the sas it can be seen that variation of the k oh s values for the three dissociation forms fig 2 corresponds with variation of the k oh a values at the different ph conditions fig 1 as shown in fig 2 the zwitterionic forms of all the fqs degrade the fastest while their cationic forms degrade the slowest for the sas the k oh s values for the neutral species are lower than those for the cationic and anionic forms additionally sulfamerazine sulfamethoxazole sulfameter sulfadiazine sulfamethizole sulfamethazine sulfapyridine and sulfaguanidine show a similar tendency of their anionic forms presenting the highest k oh s values among the three forms while the k oh s values for sa forms of sulfachloropyridazine sulfathiazole and sulfadimethoxine are higher than those for the other two forms for most of the antibiotics under study this study is the first to report the k oh s values for the different protonated states which enriches the k oh database of omps and is of importance for the fate assessment of the antibiotics in previous studies k oh a values of several sas were determined at ph 3 using the fenton system boreen et al 2004 2005 or at ph 7 using the uv h2o2 system zhang et al 2016 in this study the k oh a values for the sas were determined neither at ph 3 or ph 7 to compare the different sets of k oh a values the k oh a values of the sas at ph 3 and ph 7 were calculated by eq 3 with the k oh s values table s6 it is known that measured k oh a values vary in consequence of different experimental conditions shemer et al 2006 as can be seen from fig 3 and table s7 there is a slight difference between the k oh a values of the sas at ph 3 in the current study and the studies of boreen et al 2004 2005 the k oh a values of sulfamethazine and sulfamerazine in the current study are approximately equal to or a bit higher than those determined by boreen et al 2004 2005 respectively while the k oh a values of the other sas are a bit lower than the values determined previously it can also be found from previous studies huber et al 2003 packer et al 2003 pereira et al 2007 that for a same compound e g naproxen clofibric acid ibuprofen k oh a determined by the uv h2o2 system differs either higher or lower from that determined by the fenton system thus the difference between the k oh a values determined in the current and the previous studies may mainly attribute to the different experimental systems the fenton system in the studies of boreen et al 2004 2005 versus the uv h2o2 system in the current study to evaluate potential errors of the determined k oh a ratio factors rf between the k oh a values in the current study and in the previous studies were calculated as can be seen from table s7 all the rf values at ph 3 are 2 which is within the most acceptable range of rf values 3 for measured k oh a values by competition kinetics from different laboratories von sonntag and von gunten 2012 compared with the k oh a values at ph 7 determined by zhang et al 2016 using the uv h2o2 system the k oh a values in the current study are generally lower fig 3 and table s7 according to shemer et al 2006 and huber et al 2003 the selection of reference compounds is also an important factor that induces errors of the competition kinetics results in the studies of zhang et al 2016 nitrobenzene was employed as a reference compound it can be found from previous studies armbrust 2000 baeza and knappe 2011 shemer et al 2006 zhang et al 2016 that k oh a values of many omps e g sulfadiazine molinate diuron determined using nitrobenzene as the reference compound with the uv h2o2 system are generally higher than those employing other reference compounds e g acetophenone molinate atrazine para chlorobenzoic acid as can be concluded from table s8 thus the use of acetophenone as the reference compound in the current study may lead to comparatively lower determined k oh a values than the corresponding values at ph 7 determined by zhang et al 2016 nevertheless all the rf values at ph 7 are 2 table s7 and within the range of rf values for measured k oh a von sonntag and von gunten 2012 moreover the logk oh a values at ph 3 and ph 7 in the current study table s7 fall within the range of the previously determined logk oh a values 0 3 log units fig s7 therefore it can be concluded that the k oh a values of the sas at ph 3 and ph 7 agree with those reported previously boreen et al 2004 2005 zhang et al 2016 3 3 qsar model for k oh s based on the determined k oh s values table s6 a qsar model was developed for logk oh s of the antibiotic species 4 logk oh s 9 724 0 2180 c 006 0 6650 q c 0 01300 μ n tr 45 r 2 adj 0 805 rmse tr 0 228 q 2 loo 0 778 q 2 boot 0 770 n ext 15 r 2 ext 0 820 q 2 ext 0 816 rmse ext 0 197 where n tr and n ext are the number of the data points in the training set and validation set respectively r 2 adj and r 2 ext are adjusted and external determination coefficients respectively q 2 ext is external validation coefficient rmse tr and rmse ext are root mean square errors for the training set and validation set respectively q 2 loo and q 2 boot are the leave one out cross validated and bootstrap method repeated 5000 times at each step 20 of objects are left out from the training set coefficients respectively some of the parameters are detailed in the sm the model has three molecular structural descriptors the dragon descriptor c 006 the number of ch2rx fragments the most positive net atomic charge on c atoms q c and the molecular dipole moment μ values of the descriptors are listed in table s9 variance inflation factors norusis 1997 for these descriptors are all 10 table s10 indicating that these descriptors are free of multicollinearities this model possesses high values of r 2 adj q 2 loo q 2 boot r 2 ext and q 2 ext and low values of rmse tr as well as rmse ext indicating the qsar model has high goodness of fit robustness and predictive performance plot of predicted versus experimental logk oh s values fig s8 shows that the absolute values of the residuals were 0 6 log units indicating that the predicted logk oh s values agree well with the experimental values the applicability domain of the model is characterized in fig s9 for all the species in the training and validation sets the absolute values of standardized residual defined in the sm are smaller than 3 suggesting there are no outliers in addition the leverage values of all the species in the training and validation sets are lower than the warning leverage value h 0 27 indicating none of the compounds is particularly influential in the model space and thus the training set has good representativeness therefore the developed qsar model meets all the criteria set by the oecd for qsar models to be applied for regulatory purposes oecd 2007 and it can be employed to predict aqueous k oh s for other fq and sa species within the applicability domain the t values of the t test for the three descriptors are listed in table s10 among the descriptors c 006 is the most statistically significant t 6 526 with a positive coefficient defined as the number of specific atom types in a molecule and calculated on the basis of molecular composition as well as atom connectivities ghose et al 1998 viswanadhan et al 1989 c 006 encodes the number of ch2rx r group linked through c atom x electronegative atoms such as o n s p se halogens fragments since oh reactions can occur on functional groups with reactive h atoms via h abstraction minakata et al 2009 chemicals with ch2rx groups may be more easily attacked by oh leading to their higher oh reactivity the quantum chemical descriptor q c is the second most statistically significant t 4 153 correlating negatively with logk oh s with a more positive formal charge the c atom tends to possess poorer ability to donate electrons since oh is an electrophile chemicals with these c atoms can be hardly attacked by oh thus leading to low oh reactivity μ encodes displacement with respect to centers of positive and negative charges and carries information about charge distribution in a molecule luo et al 2017 the positive coefficient of μ indicates that a chemical with a higher μ value is more inclined to react with oh the developed qsar model is capable to predict the aqueous k oh s of fqs and sas within the applicability domain and thus k oh a under realistic environmental ph conditions to further verify predictability of the model sulfisoxazole was selected as a case since the k oh a values of this compound have been measured at ph 3 boreen et al 2004 and ph 7 zhang et al 2016 the k oh a values that were calculated based on eq 3 from k oh s for the 3 dissociation forms table s11 predicted by the qsar model are 1 44 109 m 1s 1 at ph 3 and 2 68 109 m 1s 1 at ph 7 table s12 prediction accuracy of qsars relies on data used for training the models since most of the k oh a values determined in the current study are generally lower than the corresponding values determined in the previous studies table s7 it is not surprising that the k oh a values for sulfisoxazole predicted by the qsar model are lower than those reported previously table s12 nevertheless it can be seen that the predicted k oh a values for sulfisoxazole and those reported previously are within a same order of magnitude 109 m 1s 1 and the predicted k oh a values show a trend of increase from ph 3 to ph 7 which is similar to that for the experimental values lee and von gunten 2012 reported that rate constants predicted by qsars for advanced oxidation processes have a potential error of a factor of up to 9 ratio factors between the k oh a in previous studies and the k oh a predicted by the current qsar at ph 3 and ph 7 are 4 57 and 2 74 respectively table s12 and the differences between the previously reported and the qsar predicted logk oh a values are 0 7 log units therefore the current qsar model has a satisfactory performance for k oh prediction it deserves mentioning that to date most qsar models on environmental chemicals have been constructed for non ionized organic molecules the qsar model in this study encompasses both organic non ionized molecules and anions cations which indicates that it is possible to construct qsars for organic anions cations the development of qsars that cover organic anions cations in the training validation sets is of great importance since the molecular structures of many emerging omps carry various ionizable functional groups and these pollutants can ionize in the aquatic environment or in engineered facilities like waste water treatment plants from this point of view this study exemplifies how to develop qsars that can predict environmental behavior of organic ions nevertheless it needs to be pointed out that the current study investigated only two categories of antibiotics with three protonated states more efforts are needed to develop similar qsars that cover more organic ionizable molecules and protonated states 4 conclusions the 20 antibiotics investigated can react rapidly with oh k oh a or k oh s 109 m 1s 1 and their reactivity towards oh varies among the different dissociation forms for the fluoroquinolones the zwitterionic forms and the cationic forms possess the highest and lowest k oh s values respectively while for the sulfonamides the neutral forms possess the lowest k oh s values the established qsar model exhibits satisfactory statistical performance and may pave a new way for predicting the aqueous k oh values of antibiotics with different protonated states according to the model the number of ch2rx fragments the most positive net atomic charge on c atoms and the molecular dipole moment are the main factors governing oh reactivity of the investigated antibiotics increases in the number of ch2rx fragments and the values of molecular dipole moment lead to an increase of the logk oh s values while increases in the values of the most positive net atomic charge on c atoms lead to a decrease of the logk oh s values declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

18486,the present study investigated the effect of oxoanions on catalytic behaviour of copper corrosion products ccps during chlorination of bromide containing waters three types of oxoanions carbonate sulphate and phosphate and four types of ccps cu2 cu oh 2 cu2o and cuo were involved in investigation and the effect of oxoanions concentration was also examined the result indicated that carbonate and sulphate slightly inhibited oxidant decay in the presence of ccps but the formation of brominated disinfection by products br dbps remained largely unchanged in contrast the presence of phosphate 0 2 1 mm almost eliminated the catalytic effect of cu2 for ccp solids i e cu oh 2 cu2o and cuo phosphate preferentially inhibited the formation of bromate rather than br dbps despite the catalysis by ccp solids was reduced to some extent the oxidant decay rate and bromate and br dbp formation were still significantly higher than blank groups even at high phosphate concentration by testing different addition scheme simultaneous sequential addition it was proposed that phosphate was a strong competitor for hypohalites rapidly destroying ccps hypohalites complexes on some adsorption sites however there were some specific sites that can only be adsorbed by hypohalites leading to the incomplete inhibition of phosphate finally the inhibition effect of phosphate on ccps catalysis was tested in real water matrix for cu2 higher reduction of bromate and br dbps was found in raw water rather than filtered water while converse pattern was true for cu oh 2 and cu2o and this discrepancy can be ascribed to the difference in catalytic mechanism between cu2 and ccp solids graphical abstract image 1 keywords oxidant decay br dbps bromate copper corrosion products complexation oxoanions 1 introduction because of the effectiveness in killing bacteria copper is widely used in household water distribution system feng et al 1996 according to a survey copper pipes account for 56 3 of the total customer service lines in the u s usepa 2007 however corrosion can occur on copper surface in the presence of oxygen and disinfectant residue producing a series of copper corrosion products ccps habib 1998 sharma et al 2017 copper ion cu2 cupric hydroxide cu oh 2 cuprous oxide cu2o and cupric oxide cuo are main ccp species formed in drinking water distribution system li et al 2007 the catalytic behaviour of those ccps has been studied extensively it has been reported that the presence of ccp solids cu oh 2 cu2o and cuo can remarkably enhance the decomposition of chlorine producing oxygen and chloride as major products lister 1956 li et al 2007 nguyen et al 2011 zhang and andrews 2012 the accelerated chlorine decay is mainly ascribed to the formation of ccps hypochlorite complex when copper oxides or hydroxides are present in the water their surfaces are usually covered with hydroxyl groups stumm et al 1992 chlorine would be absorbed on the surface of copper oxides as lewis base replacing hydroxyl groups to form surface complexes and facilitating the decomposition of chlorine hocl lewis 1927 this process is recognised as ligand exchange that can be described by eq 1 according to those studies the products of ccps catalysed decomposition of chlorine are oxygen and chloride it is also well established that the disproportionation of hypohalites eq 2 is a very slow process and the formation of halates is generally negligible during water treatment and distribution however liu et al 2012 reported that a significant amount of chlorate was formed in hocl cuo system and a cuo catalysed disproportionation pathway eq 3 of chlorine was suggested for the first time during the chlorination of bromide containing water bromide is oxidised to hypobromous acid and hypobromite khocl br 1 5 103 m 1s 1 kocl br 9 0 10 4 m 1s 1 deborde and von gunten 2008 similarly it is also found that cuo can catalyse the decay of bromine liu et al 2012 in hocl cuo br system bromide produced from decomposition and disproportionation is re oxidised by chlorine to bromine which further undergoes disproportionation and decomposition until chlorine depletes completely converting most bromide to bromate liu et al 2012 note that in bromide containing waters the formation of chlorate is expected to be negligible and bromate should be the main formed halate liu et al 2012 recently hu et al 2016 reported that under the catalysis of cu2 and cu2o bromate is also formed during chlorination of bromide containing waters the mechanism of the catalysis by cu2 is different from those of ccp solids and will be discussed later 1 c u o h h o x c u o x h 2 o x c l b r 2 2 h o x c c p s 2 x o 2 2 h x c l b r 3 3 h o x c c p s 2 x x o 3 x c l b r in the presence of

pipes or in solutions with ccps blatchley et al 2003 li et al 2007 2008 hu et al 2016 liu and croué 2016 moreover ccps also tend to affect dbp speciation liu and croué 2016 propose that in the presence of cuo the formation of brominated dbps br dbps is preferentially enhanced during chlorination generally br dbps exhibit higher cytotoxicity and genotoxicity than chlorinated dbps therefore are of greater concern during chlorination of bromide containing waters yang and shang 2004 richardson et al 2007 yang et al 2014 zhai et al 2014 plewa and wagner 2015 zhu et al 2015 pan et al 2017 xiang et al 2019 as described above the presence of ccps plays an important role in hypohalites decay and the formation and speciation of dbps in real waters there are many co existing oxoanions e g sulphate carbonate and phosphate that can also adsorb on the surface of ccp solids acting as potential competitors for hypohalites to affect the catalytic behaviours stumm et al 1992 take phosphate for example in some eutrophic surface water phosphate concentration reaches up to several mg l smith et al 1999 moreover those oxoanions can also be introduced during water treatment processes phosphate is commonly applied as corrosion inhibitor in distribution pipes according to a survey more than half of us utilities use phosphate inhibitor 0 2 1 0 mg l as p for copper corrosion control mcneill and edwards 2002 the competitive adsorption between oxoanions and arsenate on goethite has been studied widely hingston et al 1971 manning and goldberg 1996 hongshao and stanforth 2001 researchers also found that the catalysis of cu2 in oxidation was strongly inhibited by phosphate yuan et al 2013 however little information is available regarding how oxoanions could affect the complexation behaviour of ccps during chlorination and its catalysis in oxidant decay and dbp formation the purpose of this study was to elucidate the effect of oxoanions on ccp catalysis in oxidant decay and dbp formation with a focus on br dbps due to their elevated toxicity the factors including oxoanion type carbonate sulphate and phosphate ccp type cu2 cu oh 2 cu2o and cuo and oxoanion concentration were investigated to explore the mechanism of adsorptive competition between oxoanions and hypohalites on ccp solids different addition schemes of phosphate were also examined finally to mimic realistic conditions experiments were conducted with water samples collected from a drinking water treatment plant 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the chlorine dosing solution was prepared by diluting a concentrated solution of sodium hypochlorite 4 5 active chlorine sigma aldrich st louis usa in ultrapure water and calibrated daily with a portable spectrophotometer hach pocket

prepared with sodium sulphate the surface area of cu oh 2 cu2o and cuo was determined to be 5 3 9 7 and 8 6 m2 g respectively dbp standards including thms haloacetaldehydes hals haloacetonitriles hans

dissolution according to a survey in canada cu2 occurs in the range of 0 03 0 9 mg l for municipal central water supply plants while the maximum can reach to 1 8 mg l for private wells healthcanada 2019 moreover copper sulphate has been used to control algae in water supply reservoir and lakes for decades and the maximum recommended dose of copper sulphate is 2 mg l as cu tsai et al 2019 in this study cu2 was dosed at a concentration of 2 mg l in the form of copper chloride cu oh 2 cu2o and cuo were applied at 1 g l which were similar to those adopted in previous literatures as shown in table s3 blatchley et al 2003 li et al 2007 liu et al 2012 2013 zhang and andrews 2012 hu et al 2016 han et al 2018 huang et al 2019 in this study three oxoanions i e phosphate carbonate and sulphate were spiked at concentrations of 0 2 0 5 and 1 mm unless otherwise noted oxoanions were added simultaneously with chlorine control experiments were conducted under same condition but without the addition of tested oxoanions while oxoanions and ccps were both excluded in blank experiments for the chlorination of ha solution a chlorine does of 15 mg cl2 l was used to achieve a detectable chlorine residue and an initial bromide concentration of 10 μm was selected in us and canada bromide concentrations range from 24 to 1120 μg l with a median of 109 μg l in source water richardson et al 2008 the initial bromide concentration of 10 μm was selected to amplify the formation of bromate and br dbps in ha solutions in order to investigate the competition mechanism between hypohalites and phosphate chlorine and phosphate were dosed sequentially and simultaneously when chlorine was added first phosphate was added after 1 5 h when phosphate was added first two equilibration time 0 5 and 1 0 h were tested to better simulate realistic condition the experiments with real water samples were conducted at ambient concentration of bromide and chlorine was dosed at predetermined concentrations to achieve a residual oxidant of 1 0 0 5 mg cl2 l after 24 h after certain reaction time three aliquots of tested solution were collected and filtered with 0 22 μm glass fibre filters to remove ccp solids in aqueous phase one aliquot was used for the measurement oxidant residue while other two were quenched with excess ammonia chloride and l ascorbic acid and then subjected to dbp and bromate analysis respectively this is because the formed hans and hams can rapidly decompose to corresponding n chloro hams which can be reduced to hams by several quenching agents l ascorbic acid sodium sulphate and sodium thiosulphate except ammonia chloride resulting in an erroneous detection yu and reckhow 2017 ding et al 2018 with ammonia chlorine hypohalites were quenched as chloramine bromamine or bromochloramine which can still react with dom heeb et al 2014 to minimize further dbp formation liquid liquid extraction was performed immediately after quenching 2 3 analytical methods

relative standard deviation of two replicates 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of oxoanions on oxidant decay in the presence of ccps as compared with blank groups the presence of four types of ccps in control groups with ccps but without oxoanions all resulted in a faster oxidant decay fig 1 when phosphate was dosed to the solution a distinct inhibition effect on oxidant decay was observed compared with control group the decay rate of oxidant decreased by 40 from 0 05 to 0 03 h 1 85 from 0 54 to 0 08 h 1 52 from 0 23 to 0 11 h 1 and 29 from 0 07 to 0 05 h 1 for solution with cu2 cu oh 2 cu2o and cuo respectively differing from ccp solids cu2 has little effect on hypohalites decay in the absence of dom zhang and andrews 2012 instead the accelerated oxidant decay is mainly due to the interaction between cu2 and functional groups e g carbonyl and hydroxyl groups of dom moieties forming cu nom complexes and enhancing the reactivity of dom towards hypohalites blatchley et al 2003 fu et al 2009 however the presence of phosphate almost eliminated the acceleration of oxidant decay by cu2 as the profile of solution with phosphate followed the same trajectory with blank group fig 1a this can be ascribed to the formation of cupric phosphate edwards et al 2002 xu et al 2013 which is insoluble and has no catalytic effect in distribution system where phosphate is used as corrosion inhibitor cupric phosphate usually acts as a protective layer on the pipe surface to prevent the dissolution and release of cu2 edwards et al 2002 no inhibition effect was found in experiments with carbonate and sulphate on the contrary the addition of carbonate enhanced oxidant decay oxidant decay rate increased by 12 from 0 05 to 0 06 h 1 zhang and andrews 2013 reported that copper speciation was affected by carbonate alkalinity and the presence of carbonate can significantly increase the proportion of aqueous copper therefore it is likely that more cu2 could bond with dom leading to a higher reactivity of dom and thus faster oxidant decay as mentioned early in this article the accelerated decay of hypohalites in the presence of ccp solids is due to formation of ccps hypohalites complexes via ligand exchange stumm et al 1992 however the formation of surface complex is competitive and other co occurring oxoanions i e ligands compete with hypohalites for sorption sites stumm et al 1992 thus fewer is available for hypohalites to form hypohalites ccps complexes the considerable decrease in oxidant decay rate indicates that phosphate is a good competitor for hypohalites it probably because phosphate is a strong bidentate ligand that can bridge two metal centers in the surface lattice to form binuclear inner sphere surface complexes stumm 1997 the strong adsorption of phosphate to metal oxides has also been reported by other researchers for example in the presence of phosphate at 1 mm the adsorption of arsenic to cuo decrease by 55 martinson and reddy 2009 in contrast the addition of carbonate or sulphate induced less inhibition for all investigated ccps than phosphate did for solution with cu oh 2 the presence of sulphate and carbonate decreased oxidant decay rate by 19 from 0 54 to 0 44 h 1 and by 30 from 0 54 to 0 38 h 1 respectively the inhibition by carbonate on oxidant decay in solution with cu2o was even less with a decrease by 9 from 0 23 to 0 21 h 1 rahnemaie et al 2007 concluded that the binding of carbonate on goethite was much weaker than that of phosphate so carbonate was unlikely to be as competitive as phosphate if they present in a similar concentration level geelhoed et al 1997 claimed that sulphate ion can be a potent competitor for phosphate on goethite but the condition ph 5 was rare during drinking water treatment 3 2 br dbp formation in the presence of oxoanions for solution with ccps br dbp and bromate formation in the presence of ccps and tested oxoanions is shown in fig 2 without the addition of carbonate sulphate phosphate i e control groups four types of ccps all induced a significant enhancement in the formation of br dbps as compared with blank groups dashed line the presence of carbonate promoted br dbp formation by 7 for solution with cu2 but had little effect for solutions with cu oh 2 cu2o and cuo the concentration of br dbps did not been largely affected by addition of sulphate but was reduced to different extent in the presence of phosphate for solution with ccps especially for solution with cu2 the sum of br dbp concentration was reduced by phosphate to a similar level with that of blank group dashed line in fig 2a i e the presence of phosphate nearly completely eradicated the catalytic effect of cu2 when phosphate was present in solutions cu2 was transformed to insoluble copper phosphate preventing dom from bonding with cu2 and the formation of br dbps was inhibited consequently investigations with model compounds illustrate that cu2 also facilitates decarboxylation and enolization and those reactions are known as important steps in the formation pathway of thms blatchley et al 2003 fu et al 2009 moreover phosphate prevented cu2 from acting as oxidant to convert dom into more potent dbp precursors pham et al 2012 hu et al 2016 those catalytic behaviour of cu2 on dbp formation were all interfered in the presence of phosphate the specific formation of dbps is presented in fig s1 it was found that at tested bromide level 10 μm thms hals hans and hams were dominated by brominated species brominated hals were mainly tribrominated whereas the formation of tribrominated species was minor for brominated hans and hams moreover the change in concentration followed a similar pattern for each dbp species probably due to the low concentration ham formation remained unchanged in the presence of cu2 or oxoanions as shown in fig 2 the presence of phosphate decreased br dbp concentration from 2155 9 to 1720 4 nm and from 2654 2 to 2320 6 nm for solution with cu oh 2 and cu2o respectively and the reduction was mainly associated with br thms ccps hypohalites complexes exhibited higher reactivity towards slow reacting moieties of dom liu and croué 2016 which was expected to promote dbp formation however under competition with phosphate fewer reaction sites were available for hypohalites to form corresponding complexes resulting in lower br dbp formation for solution with cu2o phosphate was ineffective in supressing the formation of hans fig s3 which was the primary contributor to dbp associated cytotoxicity of chlorinated waters cuthbertson et al 2019 in contrast the effect of phosphate on br dbp formation was insignificant for solution with cuo fig 2d despite total hal concentration decreased from 322 3 to 238 4 nm fig s4 this is likely due to the abundance of adsorption site when the concentration of adsorbates e g hypohalites and phosphate is less than that of available adsorption sites the amount of formed complexes would be highly related to that of adsorbates dixit and hering 2003 in another word if there were plenty of adsorption sites on the surface of ccp solids hypohalites and phosphate could take their own share therefore less competition between them would take place in result the ccps can still significantly enhance oxidant decay and br dbp formation in the presence of phosphate which was the case for cuo it is not surprising that no bromate was found in the blank groups because the disproportionation of bromine is very slow in the absence of ccps liu et al 2012 as compared with corresponding control group phosphate reduced bromate formation by 100 from 810 1 to 0 nm 62 from 330 4 to 124 0 nm 41 from 729 8 to 430 1 nm and 22 from 1541 3 to 1199 7 nm for solutions with cu2 cu oh 2 cu2o and cuo respectively while the effect of carbonate and sulphate was still insignificant it should be noted that the formation of br dbps only decreased by 15 20 13 and 0 correspondingly i e the formation bromate was more susceptible to phosphate than that of br dbps the difficulty to inhibit dbp formation is likely due to the complexity of its pathways for instance despite halogenation and oxidation by hypohalites play important roles during the formation of hans there are some steps e g decarboxylation and hydrochloric acid elimination that are not strongly dependent on hypohalites shah and mitch 2012 however the formation of bromate was mainly associated with disproportionation of bromine liu et al 2012 therefore the reduction in ccps hypohalites complexes induced by phosphate was less effective to inhibit dbp formation moreover bromine incorporated in br dbps was significant higher than bromate fig s5 indicating ccps catalysed disproportionation was the minor pathway for the fate of bromine in dom containing system in the presence of phosphate the disproportionation of bromine gained even less significance as the decrease of bromine in br dbps was less than bromate this further emphasised the important role of phosphate for the fate of bromine 3 3 the effect of phosphate concentration regarding the strong inhibition effect of phosphate oxidant decay bromate and br dbp formation were investigated at different phosphate concentrations as described in fig 3 in tested phosphate concentration range no significant change in oxidant decay and br dbp formation was found for solution with cu2 and bromate was undetectable even at low phosphate concentration 0 2 mm in contrast for solution with cu oh 2 oxidant decay rate br dbp and bromate formation decreased monotonically with increasing phosphate concentration with minimum decay rate of 0 06 h 1 br dbps of 1582 71 nm and bromate of 90 2 nm at a phosphate dose of 1 mm for solutions with cu2o oxidant decayed more slowly and lower concentration of br dbps formed as phosphate concentration increased from 0 to 0 5 mm but further increase in phosphate dose exhibited negligible effect in comparison a decrease in br dbp formation was only achieved at high phosphate concentration 1 mm for solution with cuo although low concentration 0 2 and 0 5 mm of phosphate slightly inhibited oxidant decay as phosphate concentration increased the diverse trends for different types of ccp solids were associated with the abundance of adsorption site it should be noted that the catalytic behaviour of ccp solids was much insensitive to phosphate than that of cu2 even for the most susceptible ccp solids i e cu oh 2 the oxidant decay rate bromate and br dbp formation was still substantially higher than blank group at high phosphate concentration 1 mm there are two possibilities proposed for this observation i the affinity of phosphate to ccps is comparable to that of hypohalites and formed ccps hypohalites complexes would not be transformed to ccps phosphate complexes therefore the catalytic effect of ccp solids cannot be inhibited completely ii phosphate has higher affinity towards ccps and phosphate ion can replace adsorbed hypohalites on the surface of ccps i e desorption destroying the formed ccps hypohalites via ligand exchange as described in eq 4 however there were some specific sites that could only be adsorbed by hypohalites resulting in the incomplete inhibition by phosphate to better understand the competition between phosphate and hypohalites phosphate and chlorine were added both simultaneously and sequentially in latter section 4 c u o x l c u l o x 3 4 mechanism of the competition between hypohalites and phosphate as shown in fig 4 when chlorine was added first oxidant was consumed rapidly with a high decay rate of 0 65 h 1 but after the addition of phosphate at 1 5 h a distinct inhibition was observed and oxidant decay rate was decreased drastically to 0 12 h 1 this implies phosphate is a stronger ligand than hypohalites replacing hypohalites on some sites nonselective sites and leading to an attenuate oxidant decay the incomplete replacement was associated with a nonexchangeable fraction it is proposed that there were some sites that were specific for each ligand and ccps hypohalites complexes formed on those sites would not be influenced by phosphate the possibility of selective sites has also been suggested previously by researchers who investigated the competitive complexation mechanism of oxoanions adsorption on goethite hingston et al 1971 manning and goldberg 1996 when phosphate was added first phosphate was allowed to equilibrate for 0 5 and 1 0 h before the addition of chlorine after desired equilibration time the oxidant decay was still accelerated to some extent phosphate did not completely block adsorption sites which further verified the presence of selective sites for hypohalites according to hongshao and stanforth 2001 who investigated the competitive adsorption of phosphate and arsenate on goethite the extent of exchange depends on the equilibrium time of first introduced ion in this study no difference in oxidant decay was found for different equilibrium time the results were even as same as simultaneous addition this observation indicates that the adsorption of phosphate on ccp solids was a rapid process when phosphate and chlorine were added simultaneously it was likely that hypohalites could be adsorbed on some nonselective sites but those hypohalites would desorb immediately by phosphate 3 5 real water samples the influence of phosphate on the formation of br dbps and bromate in the presence of ccps was studied in real waters as shown in fig 5 the addition of phosphate resulted in lower formation of br dbps and bromate for all types of ccps during chlorination of both raw and filtered waters note the catalysis effect of cuo was not affected by phosphate in ha solutions but inhibited effectively in real waters the presence of other ions can engage in the complexation between phosphate and cuo forming ternary surface complexes which might enhance the competitiveness of phosphate and thus stronger inhibition for experiment with cu2 br dbp formation decreased by 27 for raw water under the inhibition effect of phosphate while the percentage was 12 for filtered water combined with findings in previous sections it is assumed that the catalysis by cu2 can be inhibited almost completely by phosphate this is also supported by the disappearance of bromate in the presence of phosphate for both raw and filtered water samples in contrast to filtered water raw water had higher suva table s2 i e more content of reactive sites that were ready for the complexation with cu2 to promote br dbp formation therefore the stronger inhibition by phosphate in raw water was due the higher complexation between cu2 and dom a reverse pattern was observed for ccp solids with the exception of cuo to be specific br dbp concentration deceased by 24 from 673 0 to 512 1 nm and 10 from 380 3 to 341 1 nm in raw water for cu oh 2 and cu2o while the percentages were 34 from 748 5 to 485 7 nm and 12 from 370 9 to 326 2 nm in filtered water ccps hypohalites complexes have higher enhancement on dbp formation from low suva waters liu and croué 2016 therefore the enhancement in br dbp formation by ccp solids was more remarkable in filtered water low suva the inhibition by phosphate also tended to be stronger nevertheless for experiments with cuo a stronger inhibition was obtained in raw water this is mainly associated with a poor inhibition on br han formation according to table s2 the don doc ratio of filtered water was twice of that of raw water which was favourable for the formation of nitrogenous dbps e g hans krasner et al 2016 cuthbertson et al 2019 additionally because bromide was recalcitrant during the treatment process filtered water also had higher bromide doc table s2 facilitating the incorporation of bromine into dbps singer 1993 symons et al 1993 under the catalysis of cuo br han formation was enhanced further as a result br han formation from filter water was less susceptible to phosphate than that from raw water despite the formation of other br dbps was reduced effectively 4 conclusions although carbonate or sulphate slightly affected oxidant decay for solution with ccps during chlorination the formation of br dbps remain largely unchanged the enhancement of oxidant decay and bromate and br dbp formation by cu2 was eliminated by phosphate and distinct inhibition effect was observed for solution with cu oh 2 and cu2o as well generally oxidant decay rate bromate and br dbp formation decreased with increasing phosphate concentration for solution with ccp solids but even at high phosphate concentration the catalysis of ccp solids did not disappear by testing different addition schemes it is proposed that hypohalites complexes could be destroyed rapidly by phosphate on some sites via ligand exchange but there were some specific sites a nonexchangeable fraction that could only be adsorbed by hypohalites resulting in the incomplete inhibition due to the difference in catalytic mechanism between cu2 and ccp solids different patterns were found in raw water and filtered water these findings demonstrated that additional attention should be paid to the presence of oxoanions especially phosphate and other components in the water for a comprehensive understanding of the catalysis behaviour of ccps during chlorination considering the concentrations physical forms and possible transformations of ccps as well as hydraulic conditions further study involving copper pipes should be conducted declaration of

18486,the present study investigated the effect of oxoanions on catalytic behaviour of copper corrosion products ccps during chlorination of bromide containing waters three types of oxoanions carbonate sulphate and phosphate and four types of ccps cu2 cu oh 2 cu2o and cuo were involved in investigation and the effect of oxoanions concentration was also examined the result indicated that carbonate and sulphate slightly inhibited oxidant decay in the presence of ccps but the formation of brominated disinfection by products br dbps remained largely unchanged in contrast the presence of phosphate 0 2 1 mm almost eliminated the catalytic effect of cu2 for ccp solids i e cu oh 2 cu2o and cuo phosphate preferentially inhibited the formation of bromate rather than br dbps despite the catalysis by ccp solids was reduced to some extent the oxidant decay rate and bromate and br dbp formation were still significantly higher than blank groups even at high phosphate concentration by testing different addition scheme simultaneous sequential addition it was proposed that phosphate was a strong competitor for hypohalites rapidly destroying ccps hypohalites complexes on some adsorption sites however there were some specific sites that can only be adsorbed by hypohalites leading to the incomplete inhibition of phosphate finally the inhibition effect of phosphate on ccps catalysis was tested in real water matrix for cu2 higher reduction of bromate and br dbps was found in raw water rather than filtered water while converse pattern was true for cu oh 2 and cu2o and this discrepancy can be ascribed to the difference in catalytic mechanism between cu2 and ccp solids graphical abstract image 1 keywords oxidant decay br dbps bromate copper corrosion products complexation oxoanions 1 introduction because of the effectiveness in killing bacteria copper is widely used in household water distribution system feng et al 1996 according to a survey copper pipes account for 56 3 of the total customer service lines in the u s usepa 2007 however corrosion can occur on copper surface in the presence of oxygen and disinfectant residue producing a series of copper corrosion products ccps habib 1998 sharma et al 2017 copper ion cu2 cupric hydroxide cu oh 2 cuprous oxide cu2o and cupric oxide cuo are main ccp species formed in drinking water distribution system li et al 2007 the catalytic behaviour of those ccps has been studied extensively it has been reported that the presence of ccp solids cu oh 2 cu2o and cuo can remarkably enhance the decomposition of chlorine producing oxygen and chloride as major products lister 1956 li et al 2007 nguyen et al 2011 zhang and andrews 2012 the accelerated chlorine decay is mainly ascribed to the formation of ccps hypochlorite complex when copper oxides or hydroxides are present in the water their surfaces are usually covered with hydroxyl groups stumm et al 1992 chlorine would be absorbed on the surface of copper oxides as lewis base replacing hydroxyl groups to form surface complexes and facilitating the decomposition of chlorine hocl lewis 1927 this process is recognised as ligand exchange that can be described by eq 1 according to those studies the products of ccps catalysed decomposition of chlorine are oxygen and chloride it is also well established that the disproportionation of hypohalites eq 2 is a very slow process and the formation of halates is generally negligible during water treatment and distribution however liu et al 2012 reported that a significant amount of chlorate was formed in hocl cuo system and a cuo catalysed disproportionation pathway eq 3 of chlorine was suggested for the first time during the chlorination of bromide containing water bromide is oxidised to hypobromous acid and hypobromite khocl br 1 5 103 m 1s 1 kocl br 9 0 10 4 m 1s 1 deborde and von gunten 2008 similarly it is also found that cuo can catalyse the decay of bromine liu et al 2012 in hocl cuo br system bromide produced from decomposition and disproportionation is re oxidised by chlorine to bromine which further undergoes disproportionation and decomposition until chlorine depletes completely converting most bromide to bromate liu et al 2012 note that in bromide containing waters the formation of chlorate is expected to be negligible and bromate should be the main formed halate liu et al 2012 recently hu et al 2016 reported that under the catalysis of cu2 and cu2o bromate is also formed during chlorination of bromide containing waters the mechanism of the catalysis by cu2 is different from those of ccp solids and will be discussed later 1 c u o h h o x c u o x h 2 o x c l b r 2 2 h o x c c p s 2 x o 2 2 h x c l b r 3 3 h o x c c p s 2 x x o 3 x c l b r in the presence of

pipes or in solutions with ccps blatchley et al 2003 li et al 2007 2008 hu et al 2016 liu and croué 2016 moreover ccps also tend to affect dbp speciation liu and croué 2016 propose that in the presence of cuo the formation of brominated dbps br dbps is preferentially enhanced during chlorination generally br dbps exhibit higher cytotoxicity and genotoxicity than chlorinated dbps therefore are of greater concern during chlorination of bromide containing waters yang and shang 2004 richardson et al 2007 yang et al 2014 zhai et al 2014 plewa and wagner 2015 zhu et al 2015 pan et al 2017 xiang et al 2019 as described above the presence of ccps plays an important role in hypohalites decay and the formation and speciation of dbps in real waters there are many co existing oxoanions e g sulphate carbonate and phosphate that can also adsorb on the surface of ccp solids acting as potential competitors for hypohalites to affect the catalytic behaviours stumm et al 1992 take phosphate for example in some eutrophic surface water phosphate concentration reaches up to several mg l smith et al 1999 moreover those oxoanions can also be introduced during water treatment processes phosphate is commonly applied as corrosion inhibitor in distribution pipes according to a survey more than half of us utilities use phosphate inhibitor 0 2 1 0 mg l as p for copper corrosion control mcneill and edwards 2002 the competitive adsorption between oxoanions and arsenate on goethite has been studied widely hingston et al 1971 manning and goldberg 1996 hongshao and stanforth 2001 researchers also found that the catalysis of cu2 in oxidation was strongly inhibited by phosphate yuan et al 2013 however little information is available regarding how oxoanions could affect the complexation behaviour of ccps during chlorination and its catalysis in oxidant decay and dbp formation the purpose of this study was to elucidate the effect of oxoanions on ccp catalysis in oxidant decay and dbp formation with a focus on br dbps due to their elevated toxicity the factors including oxoanion type carbonate sulphate and phosphate ccp type cu2 cu oh 2 cu2o and cuo and oxoanion concentration were investigated to explore the mechanism of adsorptive competition between oxoanions and hypohalites on ccp solids different addition schemes of phosphate were also examined finally to mimic realistic conditions experiments were conducted with water samples collected from a drinking water treatment plant 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the chlorine dosing solution was prepared by diluting a concentrated solution of sodium hypochlorite 4 5 active chlorine sigma aldrich st louis usa in ultrapure water and calibrated daily with a portable spectrophotometer hach pocket

prepared with sodium sulphate the surface area of cu oh 2 cu2o and cuo was determined to be 5 3 9 7 and 8 6 m2 g respectively dbp standards including thms haloacetaldehydes hals haloacetonitriles hans

procedures all experiments were performed in 500 ml headspace free amber bottles under continuous agitation with magnetic stirrers at a room temperature of 25 1 c the ph of ha solution was buffered at

dissolution according to a survey in canada cu2 occurs in the range of 0 03 0 9 mg l for municipal central water supply plants while the maximum can reach to 1 8 mg l for private wells healthcanada 2019 moreover copper sulphate has been used to control algae in water supply reservoir and lakes for decades and the maximum recommended dose of copper sulphate is 2 mg l as cu tsai et al 2019 in this study cu2 was dosed at a concentration of 2 mg l in the form of copper chloride cu oh 2 cu2o and cuo were applied at 1 g l which were similar to those adopted in previous literatures as shown in table s3 blatchley et al 2003 li et al 2007 liu et al 2012 2013 zhang and andrews 2012 hu et al 2016 han et al 2018 huang et al 2019 in this study three oxoanions i e phosphate carbonate and sulphate were spiked at concentrations of 0 2 0 5 and 1 mm unless otherwise noted oxoanions were added simultaneously with chlorine control experiments were conducted under same condition but without the addition of tested oxoanions while oxoanions and ccps were both excluded in blank experiments for the chlorination of ha solution a chlorine does of 15 mg cl2 l was used to achieve a detectable chlorine residue and an initial bromide concentration of 10 μm was selected in us and canada bromide concentrations range from 24 to 1120 μg l with a median of 109 μg l in source water richardson et al 2008 the initial bromide concentration of 10 μm was selected to amplify the formation of bromate and br dbps in ha solutions in order to investigate the competition mechanism between hypohalites and phosphate chlorine and phosphate were dosed sequentially and simultaneously when chlorine was added first phosphate was added after 1 5 h when phosphate was added first two equilibration time 0 5 and 1 0 h were tested to better simulate realistic condition the experiments with real water samples were conducted at ambient concentration of bromide and chlorine was dosed at predetermined concentrations to achieve a residual oxidant of 1 0 0 5 mg cl2 l after 24 h after certain reaction time three aliquots of tested solution were collected and filtered with 0 22 μm glass fibre filters to remove ccp solids in aqueous phase one aliquot was used for the measurement oxidant residue while other two were quenched with excess ammonia chloride and l ascorbic acid and then subjected to dbp and bromate analysis respectively this is because the formed hans and hams can rapidly decompose to corresponding n chloro hams which can be reduced to hams by several quenching agents l ascorbic acid sodium sulphate and sodium thiosulphate except ammonia chloride resulting in an erroneous detection yu and reckhow 2017 ding et al 2018 with ammonia chlorine hypohalites were quenched as chloramine bromamine or bromochloramine which can still react with dom heeb et al 2014 to minimize further dbp formation liquid liquid extraction was performed immediately after quenching 2 3 analytical methods

relative standard deviation of two replicates 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of oxoanions on oxidant decay in the presence of ccps as compared with blank groups the presence of four types of ccps in control groups with ccps but without oxoanions all resulted in a faster oxidant decay fig 1 when phosphate was dosed to the solution a distinct inhibition effect on oxidant decay was observed compared with control group the decay rate of oxidant decreased by 40 from 0 05 to 0 03 h 1 85 from 0 54 to 0 08 h 1 52 from 0 23 to 0 11 h 1 and 29 from 0 07 to 0 05 h 1 for solution with cu2 cu oh 2 cu2o and cuo respectively differing from ccp solids cu2 has little effect on hypohalites decay in the absence of dom zhang and andrews 2012 instead the accelerated oxidant decay is mainly due to the interaction between cu2 and functional groups e g carbonyl and hydroxyl groups of dom moieties forming cu nom complexes and enhancing the reactivity of dom towards hypohalites blatchley et al 2003 fu et al 2009 however the presence of phosphate almost eliminated the acceleration of oxidant decay by cu2 as the profile of solution with phosphate followed the same trajectory with blank group fig 1a this can be ascribed to the formation of cupric phosphate edwards et al 2002 xu et al 2013 which is insoluble and has no catalytic effect in distribution system where phosphate is used as corrosion inhibitor cupric phosphate usually acts as a protective layer on the pipe surface to prevent the dissolution and release of cu2 edwards et al 2002 no inhibition effect was found in experiments with carbonate and sulphate on the contrary the addition of carbonate enhanced oxidant decay oxidant decay rate increased by 12 from 0 05 to 0 06 h 1 zhang and andrews 2013 reported that copper speciation was affected by carbonate alkalinity and the presence of carbonate can significantly increase the proportion of aqueous copper therefore it is likely that more cu2 could bond with dom leading to a higher reactivity of dom and thus faster oxidant decay as mentioned early in this article the accelerated decay of hypohalites in the presence of ccp solids is due to formation of ccps hypohalites complexes via ligand exchange stumm et al 1992 however the formation of surface complex is competitive and other co occurring oxoanions i e ligands compete with hypohalites for sorption sites stumm et al 1992 thus fewer is available for hypohalites to form hypohalites ccps complexes the considerable decrease in oxidant decay rate indicates that phosphate is a good competitor for hypohalites it probably because phosphate is a strong bidentate ligand that can bridge two metal centers in the surface lattice to form binuclear inner sphere surface complexes stumm 1997 the strong adsorption of phosphate to metal oxides has also been reported by other researchers for example in the presence of phosphate at 1 mm the adsorption of arsenic to cuo decrease by 55 martinson and reddy 2009 in contrast the addition of carbonate or sulphate induced less inhibition for all investigated ccps than phosphate did for solution with cu oh 2 the presence of sulphate and carbonate decreased oxidant decay rate by 19 from 0 54 to 0 44 h 1 and by 30 from 0 54 to 0 38 h 1 respectively the inhibition by carbonate on oxidant decay in solution with cu2o was even less with a decrease by 9 from 0 23 to 0 21 h 1 rahnemaie et al 2007 concluded that the binding of carbonate on goethite was much weaker than that of phosphate so carbonate was unlikely to be as competitive as phosphate if they present in a similar concentration level geelhoed et al 1997 claimed that sulphate ion can be a potent competitor for phosphate on goethite but the condition ph 5 was rare during drinking water treatment 3 2 br dbp formation in the presence of oxoanions for solution with ccps br dbp and bromate formation in the presence of ccps and tested oxoanions is shown in fig 2 without the addition of carbonate sulphate phosphate i e control groups four types of ccps all induced a significant enhancement in the formation of br dbps as compared with blank groups dashed line the presence of carbonate promoted br dbp formation by 7 for solution with cu2 but had little effect for solutions with cu oh 2 cu2o and cuo the concentration of br dbps did not been largely affected by addition of sulphate but was reduced to different extent in the presence of phosphate for solution with ccps especially for solution with cu2 the sum of br dbp concentration was reduced by phosphate to a similar level with that of blank group dashed line in fig 2a i e the presence of phosphate nearly completely eradicated the catalytic effect of cu2 when phosphate was present in solutions cu2 was transformed to insoluble copper phosphate preventing dom from bonding with cu2 and the formation of br dbps was inhibited consequently investigations with model compounds illustrate that cu2 also facilitates decarboxylation and enolization and those reactions are known as important steps in the formation pathway of thms blatchley et al 2003 fu et al 2009 moreover phosphate prevented cu2 from acting as oxidant to convert dom into more potent dbp precursors pham et al 2012 hu et al 2016 those catalytic behaviour of cu2 on dbp formation were all interfered in the presence of phosphate the specific formation of dbps is presented in fig s1 it was found that at tested bromide level 10 μm thms hals hans and hams were dominated by brominated species brominated hals were mainly tribrominated whereas the formation of tribrominated species was minor for brominated hans and hams moreover the change in concentration followed a similar pattern for each dbp species probably due to the low concentration ham formation remained unchanged in the presence of cu2 or oxoanions as shown in fig 2 the presence of phosphate decreased br dbp concentration from 2155 9 to 1720 4 nm and from 2654 2 to 2320 6 nm for solution with cu oh 2 and cu2o respectively and the reduction was mainly associated with br thms ccps hypohalites complexes exhibited higher reactivity towards slow reacting moieties of dom liu and croué 2016 which was expected to promote dbp formation however under competition with phosphate fewer reaction sites were available for hypohalites to form corresponding complexes resulting in lower br dbp formation for solution with cu2o phosphate was ineffective in supressing the formation of hans fig s3 which was the primary contributor to dbp associated cytotoxicity of chlorinated waters cuthbertson et al 2019 in contrast the effect of phosphate on br dbp formation was insignificant for solution with cuo fig 2d despite total hal concentration decreased from 322 3 to 238 4 nm fig s4 this is likely due to the abundance of adsorption site when the concentration of adsorbates e g hypohalites and phosphate is less than that of available adsorption sites the amount of formed complexes would be highly related to that of adsorbates dixit and hering 2003 in another word if there were plenty of adsorption sites on the surface of ccp solids hypohalites and phosphate could take their own share therefore less competition between them would take place in result the ccps can still significantly enhance oxidant decay and br dbp formation in the presence of phosphate which was the case for cuo it is not surprising that no bromate was found in the blank groups because the disproportionation of bromine is very slow in the absence of ccps liu et al 2012 as compared with corresponding control group phosphate reduced bromate formation by 100 from 810 1 to 0 nm 62 from 330 4 to 124 0 nm 41 from 729 8 to 430 1 nm and 22 from 1541 3 to 1199 7 nm for solutions with cu2 cu oh 2 cu2o and cuo respectively while the effect of carbonate and sulphate was still insignificant it should be noted that the formation of br dbps only decreased by 15 20 13 and 0 correspondingly i e the formation bromate was more susceptible to phosphate than that of br dbps the difficulty to inhibit dbp formation is likely due to the complexity of its pathways for instance despite halogenation and oxidation by hypohalites play important roles during the formation of hans there are some steps e g decarboxylation and hydrochloric acid elimination that are not strongly dependent on hypohalites shah and mitch 2012 however the formation of bromate was mainly associated with disproportionation of bromine liu et al 2012 therefore the reduction in ccps hypohalites complexes induced by phosphate was less effective to inhibit dbp formation moreover bromine incorporated in br dbps was significant higher than bromate fig s5 indicating ccps catalysed disproportionation was the minor pathway for the fate of bromine in dom containing system in the presence of phosphate the disproportionation of bromine gained even less significance as the decrease of bromine in br dbps was less than bromate this further emphasised the important role of phosphate for the fate of bromine 3 3 the effect of phosphate concentration regarding the strong inhibition effect of phosphate oxidant decay bromate and br dbp formation were investigated at different phosphate concentrations as described in fig 3 in tested phosphate concentration range no significant change in oxidant decay and br dbp formation was found for solution with cu2 and bromate was undetectable even at low phosphate concentration 0 2 mm in contrast for solution with cu oh 2 oxidant decay rate br dbp and bromate formation decreased monotonically with increasing phosphate concentration with minimum decay rate of 0 06 h 1 br dbps of 1582 71 nm and bromate of 90 2 nm at a phosphate dose of 1 mm for solutions with cu2o oxidant decayed more slowly and lower concentration of br dbps formed as phosphate concentration increased from 0 to 0 5 mm but further increase in phosphate dose exhibited negligible effect in comparison a decrease in br dbp formation was only achieved at high phosphate concentration 1 mm for solution with cuo although low concentration 0 2 and 0 5 mm of phosphate slightly inhibited oxidant decay as phosphate concentration increased the diverse trends for different types of ccp solids were associated with the abundance of adsorption site it should be noted that the catalytic behaviour of ccp solids was much insensitive to phosphate than that of cu2 even for the most susceptible ccp solids i e cu oh 2 the oxidant decay rate bromate and br dbp formation was still substantially higher than blank group at high phosphate concentration 1 mm there are two possibilities proposed for this observation i the affinity of phosphate to ccps is comparable to that of hypohalites and formed ccps hypohalites complexes would not be transformed to ccps phosphate complexes therefore the catalytic effect of ccp solids cannot be inhibited completely ii phosphate has higher affinity towards ccps and phosphate ion can replace adsorbed hypohalites on the surface of ccps i e desorption destroying the formed ccps hypohalites via ligand exchange as described in eq 4 however there were some specific sites that could only be adsorbed by hypohalites resulting in the incomplete inhibition by phosphate to better understand the competition between phosphate and hypohalites phosphate and chlorine were added both simultaneously and sequentially in latter section 4 c u o x l c u l o x 3 4 mechanism of the competition between hypohalites and phosphate as shown in fig 4 when chlorine was added first oxidant was consumed rapidly with a high decay rate of 0 65 h 1 but after the addition of phosphate at 1 5 h a distinct inhibition was observed and oxidant decay rate was decreased drastically to 0 12 h 1 this implies phosphate is a stronger ligand than hypohalites replacing hypohalites on some sites nonselective sites and leading to an attenuate oxidant decay the incomplete replacement was associated with a nonexchangeable fraction it is proposed that there were some sites that were specific for each ligand and ccps hypohalites complexes formed on those sites would not be influenced by phosphate the possibility of selective sites has also been suggested previously by researchers who investigated the competitive complexation mechanism of oxoanions adsorption on goethite hingston et al 1971 manning and goldberg 1996 when phosphate was added first phosphate was allowed to equilibrate for 0 5 and 1 0 h before the addition of chlorine after desired equilibration time the oxidant decay was still accelerated to some extent phosphate did not completely block adsorption sites which further verified the presence of selective sites for hypohalites according to hongshao and stanforth 2001 who investigated the competitive adsorption of phosphate and arsenate on goethite the extent of exchange depends on the equilibrium time of first introduced ion in this study no difference in oxidant decay was found for different equilibrium time the results were even as same as simultaneous addition this observation indicates that the adsorption of phosphate on ccp solids was a rapid process when phosphate and chlorine were added simultaneously it was likely that hypohalites could be adsorbed on some nonselective sites but those hypohalites would desorb immediately by phosphate 3 5 real water samples the influence of phosphate on the formation of br dbps and bromate in the presence of ccps was studied in real waters as shown in fig 5 the addition of phosphate resulted in lower formation of br dbps and bromate for all types of ccps during chlorination of both raw and filtered waters note the catalysis effect of cuo was not affected by phosphate in ha solutions but inhibited effectively in real waters the presence of other ions can engage in the complexation between phosphate and cuo forming ternary surface complexes which might enhance the competitiveness of phosphate and thus stronger inhibition for experiment with cu2 br dbp formation decreased by 27 for raw water under the inhibition effect of phosphate while the percentage was 12 for filtered water combined with findings in previous sections it is assumed that the catalysis by cu2 can be inhibited almost completely by phosphate this is also supported by the disappearance of bromate in the presence of phosphate for both raw and filtered water samples in contrast to filtered water raw water had higher suva table s2 i e more content of reactive sites that were ready for the complexation with cu2 to promote br dbp formation therefore the stronger inhibition by phosphate in raw water was due the higher complexation between cu2 and dom a reverse pattern was observed for ccp solids with the exception of cuo to be specific br dbp concentration deceased by 24 from 673 0 to 512 1 nm and 10 from 380 3 to 341 1 nm in raw water for cu oh 2 and cu2o while the percentages were 34 from 748 5 to 485 7 nm and 12 from 370 9 to 326 2 nm in filtered water ccps hypohalites complexes have higher enhancement on dbp formation from low suva waters liu and croué 2016 therefore the enhancement in br dbp formation by ccp solids was more remarkable in filtered water low suva the inhibition by phosphate also tended to be stronger nevertheless for experiments with cuo a stronger inhibition was obtained in raw water this is mainly associated with a poor inhibition on br han formation according to table s2 the don doc ratio of filtered water was twice of that of raw water which was favourable for the formation of nitrogenous dbps e g hans krasner et al 2016 cuthbertson et al 2019 additionally because bromide was recalcitrant during the treatment process filtered water also had higher bromide doc table s2 facilitating the incorporation of bromine into dbps singer 1993 symons et al 1993 under the catalysis of cuo br han formation was enhanced further as a result br han formation from filter water was less susceptible to phosphate than that from raw water despite the formation of other br dbps was reduced effectively 4 conclusions although carbonate or sulphate slightly affected oxidant decay for solution with ccps during chlorination the formation of br dbps remain largely unchanged the enhancement of oxidant decay and bromate and br dbp formation by cu2 was eliminated by phosphate and distinct inhibition effect was observed for solution with cu oh 2 and cu2o as well generally oxidant decay rate bromate and br dbp formation decreased with increasing phosphate concentration for solution with ccp solids but even at high phosphate concentration the catalysis of ccp solids did not disappear by testing different addition schemes it is proposed that hypohalites complexes could be destroyed rapidly by phosphate on some sites via ligand exchange but there were some specific sites a nonexchangeable fraction that could only be adsorbed by hypohalites resulting in the incomplete inhibition due to the difference in catalytic mechanism between cu2 and ccp solids different patterns were found in raw water and filtered water these findings demonstrated that additional attention should be paid to the presence of oxoanions especially phosphate and other components in the water for a comprehensive understanding of the catalysis behaviour of ccps during chlorination considering the concentrations physical forms and possible transformations of ccps as well as hydraulic conditions further study involving copper pipes should be conducted declaration of

municipal wastewater is effectively a large pooled urine sample of all the people in a given wastewater catchment wastewater contains a wealth of information about the people it originates from such as markers of chemical consumption chemical exposure and disease choi et al 2018b the information obtained from the chemical analysis of specific human excretion products biomarkers in urban wastewater can therefore be used to estimate the per capita exposure or consumption of a substance for the population under investigation and is commonly termed as wastewater based epidemiology wbe gracia lor et al 2016 wbe has been widely applied for both spatial and temporal trends in illicit drug consumption in many jurisdictions boogaerts et al 2016 gonzález mariño et al 2016 lai et al 2016a

one promising application toward this direction is the identification of increased levels of the oxidative stress biomarker 8 iso prostaglandin f2α pgf2α in wastewater associated with tobacco consumption ryu et al 2016b oxidative stress is generally defined as the disruption in redox signalling and control often in response to an imbalance in the level of pro oxidants relative to antioxidants jones 2006 isoprostanes are accepted as reliable biomarkers of oxidative stress and their use in clinical research is well established montuschi et al 2004 they are produced in the lipid membranes of every tissue in the human body and thus their levels provide a systematic and integrated measure of oxidative stress of the three major classes of isoprostanes f d and e series f2 isoprostanes are considered the most suitable as they are the most stable among their class roberts and morrow 2000 and have been measured in a wide range of biological samples including urine milne et al 2015 multiple studies looking at f2 isoprostanes in urine have found associations between levels of oxidative stress with specific diseases e g cancer barocas et al 2011 cardiovascular disease zhang 2013 diabetes murai et al 2000 as well as lifestyle factors e g smoking keaney et al 2003 smoking and alcohol consumption in particular have strong correlation with isoprostanes levels and several fold increases in f2 isoprostane levels have been observed daughton 2012 additionally isoprostanes have also been proposed as potential emerging contaminants of concern as they are biologically active present in a wide range of species including bivalves chickens elephant seals fish and rodents and are known to be present in wastewater gaw and glover 2016 from the wbe health biomarker perspective suitable biomarkers must be 1 excreted mainly via urine in consistent amounts with sufficient concentration to allow for accurate measurement once diluted in wastewater 2 unique to human metabolism and 3 sufficiently stable in wastewater gracia lor et al 2016 it is already well established that pgf2α meets most of these criteria based on its use in the clinical setting montuschi et al 2004 and measurement within wastewater ryu et al 2015 2016b however as recommended by an expert panel its in sewer stability should be evaluated mccall et al 2015 but has yet to be assessed choi et al 2018b sewers networks are typically complex with a combination of gravity sewers gs pump stations rising mains rm and other structures with the end goal of transporting wastewater from the point of origin to the wastewater treatment plant wwtp wastewater itself comprises mostly of water but also of suspended particulate matter sediment ammonia and volatile fatty acids some of these such as ammonia and volatile fatty acids act as primary substrates supporting microbial growth on the walls of the sewer pipes termed biofilms gutierrez et al 2016 wastewater parameters including dissolved oxygen ph nutrient levels both macro and micro and temperature as well as hydraulic parameters such as pipe diameter slope and flow rates not only influence the transformation of chemicals within the sewer but also the microbial composition of the biofilms schilperoort et al 2012 sharma et al 2013 rising main sewers are generally completely filled with wastewater hence anaerobic microbes dominate them whereas gs are only partially filled with wastewater and hence their biofilms may comprise of both aerobic and anaerobic microbes hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 biofilms may substantially contribute to the transformation process as they are highly reactive ecosystems comprised mostly of heterotrophic organisms with high atp content mccall et al 2016 as such the in sewer stability of chemicals is not just a result of wastewater composition but also the microbial activity of the sewer and hence an important consideration for wbe studies to assess in sewer stability of wbe biomarkers lab scale bioreactors that simulate real sewer conditions have previously been employed as their conditions can be controlled allowing for direct comparison between sewer types to be made e g rm versus gs to account for biofilm microbial activity versus processes in bulk wastewater a reactor without biofilm control can also be used banks et al 2018 o brien et al 2017a

except paracetamol were stable indicating that paracetamol can still be used as a positive gs condition control for biomarker degradation studies o brien et al 2017a under rm conditions acesulfame was stable whereas pgf2α dnpgf2α pge2 and paracetamol showed t10 of 4 4 4 2 3 4 and 0 19 h respectively the results for acesulfame and paracetamol which are used as benchmarking or normalising chemicals are consistent with previous findings t10 of 24 h and 0 12 h for acesulfame and paracetamol respectively o brien et al 2017a demonstrating the similarity of sewer reactors performance among studies 3 4 impact on wastewater based epidemiology as indicated by the higher degradation rates in the rm reactors versus the gs and cr the microbial activity within actual sewers can influence the stability of chemical biomarkers in the present study it was observed that the rm conditions lead to degradation of all the investigated biomarkers pgf2α dnpgf2α and pge2 with a t 10 of 4 4 4 2 and 3 4 h respectively under gs conditions no degradation was observed interestingly under cr conditions where no biofilm is present and microbial activity is expected to be low thai et al 2014a pgf2α and pge2 degradation occurred with a higher t 10 of 7 8 and 5 6 h respectively but dnpgf2α remained stable both the cr and gs have an air phase but oxygen demand is higher in the gs additionally the cr has an open top whereas the gs has a lid and a tube id 8 mm connecting the inner reactor to the atmosphere hence the cr may have enhanced gas liquid transfer causing the higher do level in cr the increased oxygen levels in the cr may be responsible for the observed pgf2α and pge2 degradation it is also possible that dnpgf2α degradation was occurring but that under cr conditions pgf2α transformed to dnpgf2α hence explaining why dnpgf2α degradation was not observed typical wastewater catchments comprise mostly of gs and thus from the above observations we could expect that overall degradation would be low the hrt of the sewer systems however is typically dependent on the hrt of the rms hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 thus for catchments with high hrt degradation rates observed in the rm reactors should be considered when interpreting results from the survey conducted as part of the largest wbe study to date which involved 47 wwtps in europe the mean hydraulic residence time of these catchments was 4 h with a 95th percentile of 10 h ort et al 2014 considering this with our findings the impact of in sewer degradation on the investigated biomarkers would be negligible 10 for average sewer residence times of 4 h ort et al 2014 for a mainly gm sewer system thus satisfying the stability criteria of a good wbe biomarker gracia lor et al 2016 for sewer systems which expect longer hrt

dnpgf2α 0 100 rm by way of example a catchment with 30 rm and 12 h hrt would have possible degradation values of 9 7 9 0 and 7 3 for pge2 pgf2α and dnpgf2α respectively this illustrates the importance of the proportion of rm in a sewer network and hrt when considering an application of stability back calculation factors in wbe studies 3 5 limitations f2 isoprostanes in human urine are excreted as both free form and glucuronide conjugates with estimates suggesting the glucuronide conjugate constitutes approximately 40 yan et al 2010 in this study we only measured the free non conjugated forms of pgf2α dnpgf2α and pge2 a previous study where wastewater was deconjugated with β glucuronidase suggested that the free pgf2α acid contributes to only 2 5 of total pgf2α in wastewater ryu et al 2015 it has been suggested that the explanation for the high pgf2α glucuronide free pgf2α ratio found in wastewater could be from conversion of free pgf2α to its glucuronide by bacterial uridine 5 diphosphate glucuronic acid transferase which is expressed by many bacteria including escherichia coli tsikas 2015 our results indicated that pgf2α remained stable in wastewater when considering typical sewer systems and hydraulic retention times and even if this conjugation is occurring it is roughly equivalent to the rate of deconjugation previous studies on glucuronide conjugates have indicated that they are quickly transformed in the sewer banks et al 2018 gao et al 2017 but this could not be investigated for these biomarkers as 1 conjugated standards were not available for the investigated biomarkers and 2 measuring the naturally occurring conjugated forms of these biomarkers present within wastewater was not possible as they occur at ng l concentrations thus requiring large volumes of sample to be extracted this is not possible as the sewer reactors are only 750 ml each and sewer degradation transformation studies require samples to be taken at multiple time points 4 conclusion this study evaluated the stability of three isoprostane oxidative stress biomarkers which have been proposed for use in wbe studies to monitor population health conditions the main conclusions are 1 pgf2α dnpgf2α and pge2 are sufficiently stable under typical sewer conditions 2 kinetic models of the degradation transformation were selected for each biomarker to allow the level of in sewer degradation or formation to be estimated when the residence time and the type of sewer system is known 3 further in sewer degradation transformation studies using conjugated forms of the

18487,wastewater contains a wealth of information about the population who contribute to it including biological and chemical markers of human activity and exposures f2 isoprostanes have been proposed as oxidative stress biomarkers that can be measured in wastewater to provide a measure of oxidative stress at the population level while an association between tobacco use and their level in wastewater has been demonstrated an in sewer stability assessment has not been conducted to support their use as oxidative stress biomarkers for wastewater based epidemiology studies in this study we

municipal wastewater is effectively a large pooled urine sample of all the people in a given wastewater catchment wastewater contains a wealth of information about the people it originates from such as markers of chemical consumption chemical exposure and disease choi et al 2018b the information obtained from the chemical analysis of specific human excretion products biomarkers in urban wastewater can therefore be used to estimate the per capita exposure or consumption of a substance for the population under investigation and is commonly termed as wastewater based epidemiology wbe gracia lor et al 2016 wbe has been widely applied for both spatial and temporal trends in illicit drug consumption in many jurisdictions boogaerts et al 2016 gonzález mariño et al 2016 lai et al 2016a 2016b 2018 ort et al 2014 it has even been embraced by the european monitoring centre for drug and drug addiction ort et al 2014 thomas et al 2012 and the australian criminal intelligence commission o brien et al 2017b recently there has been some developments to extend wbe for assessing health and disease at the population level choi et al 2018a ferrando climent et al 2016 ryu et al 2016a 2016b one promising application toward this direction is the identification of increased levels of the oxidative stress biomarker 8 iso prostaglandin f2α pgf2α in wastewater associated with tobacco consumption ryu et al 2016b oxidative stress is generally defined as the disruption in redox signalling and control often in response to an imbalance in the level of pro oxidants relative to antioxidants jones 2006 isoprostanes are accepted as reliable biomarkers of oxidative stress and their use in clinical research is well established montuschi et al 2004 they are produced in the lipid membranes of every tissue in the human body and thus their levels provide a systematic and integrated measure of oxidative stress of the three major classes of isoprostanes f d and e series f2 isoprostanes are considered the most suitable as they are the most stable among their class roberts and morrow 2000 and have been measured in a wide range of biological samples including urine milne et al 2015 multiple studies looking at f2 isoprostanes in urine have found associations between levels of oxidative stress with specific diseases e g cancer barocas et al 2011 cardiovascular disease zhang 2013 diabetes murai et al 2000 as well as lifestyle factors e g smoking keaney et al 2003 smoking and alcohol consumption in particular have strong correlation with isoprostanes levels and several fold increases in f2 isoprostane levels have been observed daughton 2012 additionally isoprostanes have also been proposed as potential emerging contaminants of concern as they are biologically active present in a wide range of species including bivalves chickens elephant seals fish and rodents and are known to be present in wastewater gaw and glover 2016 from the wbe health biomarker perspective suitable biomarkers must be 1 excreted mainly via urine in consistent amounts with sufficient concentration to allow for accurate measurement once diluted in wastewater 2 unique to human metabolism and 3 sufficiently stable in wastewater gracia lor et al 2016 it is already well established that pgf2α meets most of these criteria based on its use in the clinical setting montuschi et al 2004 and measurement within wastewater ryu et al 2015 2016b however as recommended by an expert panel its in sewer stability should be evaluated mccall et al 2015 but has yet to be assessed choi et al 2018b sewers networks are typically complex with a combination of gravity sewers gs pump stations rising mains rm and other structures with the end goal of transporting wastewater from the point of origin to the wastewater treatment plant wwtp wastewater itself comprises mostly of water but also of suspended particulate matter sediment ammonia and volatile fatty acids some of these such as ammonia and volatile fatty acids act as primary substrates supporting microbial growth on the walls of the sewer pipes termed biofilms gutierrez et al 2016 wastewater parameters including dissolved oxygen ph nutrient levels both macro and micro and temperature as well as hydraulic parameters such as pipe diameter slope and flow rates not only influence the transformation of chemicals within the sewer but also the microbial composition of the biofilms schilperoort et al 2012 sharma et al 2013 rising main sewers are generally completely filled with wastewater hence anaerobic microbes dominate them whereas gs are only partially filled with wastewater and hence their biofilms may comprise of both aerobic and anaerobic microbes hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 biofilms may substantially contribute to the transformation process as they are highly reactive ecosystems comprised mostly of heterotrophic organisms with high atp content mccall et al 2016 as such the in sewer stability of chemicals is not just a result of wastewater composition but also the microbial activity of the sewer and hence an important consideration for wbe studies to assess in sewer stability of wbe biomarkers lab scale bioreactors that simulate real sewer conditions have previously been employed as their conditions can be controlled allowing for direct comparison between sewer types to be made e g rm versus gs to account for biofilm microbial activity versus processes in bulk wastewater a reactor without biofilm control can also be used banks et al 2018 o brien et al 2017a thai et al 2014a thai et al 2014c thai et al 2019 previous studies using such sewer reactors have indicated that while some compounds remain stable regardless of conditions e g acesulfame and methamphetamine o brien et al 2017a thai et al 2014a some are only stable in wastewater but not under sewer conditions e g ethyl sulfate and paracetamol banks et al 2018 o brien et al 2017a and others are unstable regardless of the conditions e g salicylic acid o brien et al 2017a it has also been shown that the degradation transformation of some biomarkers may lead to generation of others e g

biofilm systems respectively biofilm area to wastewater volume a v ratio was 72 5 m 1 in rm and 50 m 1 in gs the a v ratios of these laboratory scale reactors are relatively high which represent real

18488,in this study soluble extracellular polymeric substances s eps secreted by bacillus cereus b cereus were studied as a novel dual bio functional corrosion and scale inhibiting material in artificial seawater static tests showed that the scale inhibition efficiency si was close to 87 60 for caco3 at the concentration of 80 mg l s eps electrochemical technique results showed that s eps inhibition efficiencies in relation to 316l stainless steel ss and at the concentration of 40 mg l reached 91 05 at 10 d and 91 16 at 30 d respectively the high anti scale and anti corrosion performance of s eps was related to their chelating adsorption and biomineralization abilities s eps integrated with metal ions on the ss surface resulting in formation of a thin but dense biomineralized film which exhibited lasting corrosion resistance meanwhile s eps controlled the kinetic pathway of caco3 biomineralized nucleation and crystal growth which inhibited caco3 crystal precipitation this finding suggests that b cereus s eps may offer a green sustainable and economic strategy for anti corrosion and anti scale application in industry graphical abstract image 1 keywords soluble eps scale inhibitor corrosion inhibitor biomineralization bacillus cereus 1 introduction water shortages are becoming a global issue and use of seawater resource is one of the effective mitigation responses tang et al 2019 unfortunately equipment corrosion and scale have been an unavoidable aspect of desalination processes and also of seawater cooling systems which limit seawater utilization hoseinieh et al 2017 deyab et al 2019 corrosion and scale not only reduce heat exchange efficiency and service life but also increase water contamination kıcır et al 2016 thus a combined measure that can simultaneously protect desalination units from corrosion and scale deposition is required inhibitors are usually thought to be an efficient way to control both scale deposition and material corrosion multiple corrosion and scale inhibitor types such as organic phosphine organic phosphonate and polycarboxylic acid have been widely used ituen et al 2017 corrosion and scale inhibitors can be classified as either phosphorus containing or phosphorus free inhibitors with the former being the most popular worldwide due to their cost effective performance yu et al 2018 chaussemier et al 2015 most are non biodegradable however leading to heavy eutrophication and increased biofouling of membrane systems with the high cost of synthesis chaussemier et al 2015 hence it is necessary to develop new eco friendly corrosion and scale inhibitors with high inhibition efficiencies carboxylic hydroxylic and acylamido polymer groups have exhibited high scale and corrosion inhibition performance due to their strong ion chelation zhang et al 2016a yu et al 2018 gao et al 2015 organic matters secreted by bacteria may be potential corrosion and scale inhibitors azizi et al 2017 as they contain large amounts of these functional groups in particular extracellular polymeric substances eps a mixture of polymers with high molecular weight mainly composed of polysaccharides proteins humic like substances nucleic acid lipids and glycoproteins wang et al 2018 are easy to attach firmly to solid surfaces and form thin films belando et al 2017 thus an eps film may work as transport barrier to prevent the penetration by corrosive agents e g oxygen and chloride and decrease corrosive ions contact with metal surfaces meanwhile the acid function group substances in eps such as humic like substance and proteins have strong complexing ability with calcium ions sheng et al 2013 which may inhibit scale formation eps are classified into two types soluble eps s eps and bound eps according to the eps physical adhesion to cells and extraction difficulty comte et al 2006 their chemical compositions are similar but s eps have superior characteristics including biodegradability strong biosorption affinity great ability to exchange protonic ions and multiple fixation sites comte et al 2006 significantly s eps are a cheap easily extracted and abundant bio renewable resource yu et al 2009 suggesting that s eps have great potential for anti corrosion and scale inhibition bacillus cereus b cereus is widespread and grows easily in nature huang et al 2016 b cereus and its eps are able to adsorb onto various surfaces such as stainless steel floors conveyer belts and carbon steel and form biofilms huang et al 2016 and recently b cereus biofilm was found to inhibit stainless steel corrosion in seawater li et al 2019 eps account for 90 of the biofilm liu et al 2007 thus the role of eps should not be ignored in this context overall b cereus s eps have the potential to form complexes with inorganic ions to simultaneously inhibit metal corrosion and to control calcium carbonate formation literature available to date about s eps as corrosion and scale inhibitors is scarce so in the study described here a novel green approach to stainless steel protection and caco3 formation prevention based on s eps induced biomineralization has been proposed for the first time the intention of this study was to provide a new idea for the development of sustainable and environmentally friendly anti corrosion and scale inhibition materials s eps were extracted from b cereus supernatant using physical methods and its corrosion and scale inhibiting properties were evaluated on 316l stainless steel ss in artificial seawater electrochemical tests surface analysis and static tests showed that s eps could be used as dual bio functional corrosion and scale inhibitors in seawater environments and suggested that s eps have potential prospect for

et al 2013 the supernatant solution was collected as s eps the s eps solution was then freeze dried approximately 100 200 mg s eps could be extracted from each litre of bacterial solution in this experiment different concentrations of s eps solution were prepared using sterile distilled water 2 2 preparation of the ss electrodes and specimens ss plates were purchased from taigang stainless steel science and technology co ltd shanxi china the chemical compositions are shown in table 1 the working electrodes of ss area of 1 0 1 0 cm2 were made using the method of qu et al 2017 the

the morphologies of ss specimens after immersion in artificial seawater for 10 d with and without s eps were observed with a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem nova nanosem 450 fei before measurement samples were dehydrated successively in different proportions of ethanol solutions 20 50 75 99 and 100 for 10 min the samples s eps and absorption of s eps on the surface of ss were dried at 28 c and then pressed into a kbr pellet and analyzed with fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectral analysis ftir thermo fisher scientific nicolet is10 usa using the 400 4000 cm 1 frequency range 2 6 scale inspection test the s eps scale inhibition efficiency si as caco3 scale inhibitor was tested using the methodology previously reported in yu et al 2018 the si was calculated via equation 3 al sabagh et al 2018 in this equation ca2 is calcium ion concentration for the mixed brine treated with the inhibitor after the precipitation test ca1 is calcium ion concentration in the blank mixed brine solution after the precipitation test and ca3 is the calcium ion concentration in the blank mixed brine solution before the precipitation test 3 s i ca 2 ca 1 ca 3 ca 1 100 all experiments were conducted in triplicate on different samples to ensure reproducibility 2 7 fesem xps and fluorescent spectrophotometer analysis molar equivalent solutions from cacl2 2h2o 0 125 m and nahco3 0 125 m with and without s eps were magnetically stirred up to precipitation subsequently caco3 crystals were collected using a 0 22 μm membrane and examined the caco3 crystal shapes with and without s eps were observed with fesem nova nanosem 450 fei while x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps kα thermo was performed to evaluate caco3 crystal valence variation in the presence of s eps the electron binding energy scales of the acquired spectra were calibrated for a maximum of c 1s core excitation at 284 6 ev to reveal eps ca interaction thermodynamic parameters s eps and mixed solutions of s eps cacl2 2h2o 0 125 m and nahco3 0 125 m were determined using 3 d excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy combined with microtitrimetry hitachi the fluorescence spectra were recorded over an excitation wavelength ex of 200 450 nm 5 nm bandwidth and an emission wavelength em of 240 560 nm 5 nm bandwidth at a scanning speed of 1200 nm min all experiments were conducted in triplicate to ensure reproducibility 2 8 computational chemistry computation was used to elucidate the complex bonding sites and bonding energies to demonstrate shared electrons and to deduce eps ca coordination mechanisms oligopeptide glytrp including a tryptophan residue and glycine was built based on the fluorescence and ftir spectral data shou et al 2018 herein glycine was chosen based on its high abundance in s eps and simple structure glytrp has a completely functional protein structure containing a carboxyl residue an amino residue and a peptide shou et al 2018 molecular models were built using the gaussian 09 software and the molecular structure of glytrp was optimized at the b3lyp def2tzvp level 34 using the gaussian 09 package shou et al 2018 ca2 ions can freely move around the carboxyl residue amino residue and peptide 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of s eps and s eps film formation adsorbed on ss surfaces the ftir spectra of s eps are presented in fig 1 a and five main peaks identified the main functional groups in the s eps samples were deduced to be these at 2960 3300 1620 1400 and 1120 cm 1 wang et al 2014 of these a broad stretching vibration band in the 2960 3300 cm 1 was assigned to an n h amino group of proteins and an o h groups of carbohydrates wei et al 2016 the peak at 1400 cm 1 was the symmetric stretching peak of the carboxylic acid with ionic groups wang et al 2014 the absorption band at 1620 cm 1 corresponded to the c o stretching vibration of the amide i of the polypeptides wang et al 2014 the band near 1120 cm 1 was attributed to c o c stretching vibrations from the carbohydrates and aromatics kavita et al 2011 the adsorption peak at 660 cm 1 was related to stretching of alkyl halides kavita et al 2011 these results implied that s eps were a complex high molecular weight mixture of polymers that is humic substances and uronic and nucleic acids s eps have potential anti corrosive properties since they contain oxygen atoms in functional groups o h c o c and amide i and therefore satisfied with the general criteria for typical corrosion inhibitors gualdrón et al 2013 considering s eps adsorption onto ss surfaces fig 1b compared to fig 1a many differences could be seen the 3300 1620 and 1400 cm 1 peaks have been the red shifted to 3400 1420 and 1640 cm 1 respectively while the peak at 1120 cm 1 had split into 1150 and 1010 cm 1 fig 1b and the 660 and 551 cm 1 peaks had disappeared these changes associated with carboxyl amino and oxhydryl groups showed that the carboxyl amino and oxhydryl groups in s eps were involved in the formation of metal eps coordination 3 2 s eps corrosion inhibition performance 3 2 1 evaluation of s eps anti corrosion effect the anti corrosion performance of s eps was evaluated using electrochemical techniques and surface analysis fig 2 a e shows ss eis in artificial seawater with and without s eps cs eps 40 mg l at different times in the presence of s eps the diameters of the semicircles were significantly larger than they were in s eps absence fig 2a e the result suggested that b cereus s eps significantly inhibited ss corrosion in artificial seawater which could be attributed to the adsorption of s eps onto the ss surface the nyquist fig 2a e showed no shape distinction between with or without s eps which was attributed to the capacitive arc of the s eps film covering the capacitive arc of the passivating film but also reflected the electrochemical processes at different interfaces in general impedance spectra were analyzed using an equivalent circuit considering the contribution of each phenomenon e g the electrical double layer i e edl and film formation li et al 2019 corresponding eis data were fitted using the equivalent circuits as shown in fig 2f without s eps and fig 2g with s eps in the presence of s eps a one time constant fig 2f represented the oxidation film protective layer on the ss surface which was determined by the electrode process on the ss substrate the two time constant equivalent circuit was used to represent duplex surface film formation on the ss surface in the presence of s eps an outer layer of inhibitor film and an inner oxidation film fig 2g electrochemical parameters the solution resistance r s the charge transfer resistance r ct the film resistance r f the constant phase element of double layer capacitance q 1 and the constant phase element of s eps film q 2 were listed in table 2 fitting analysis results also indicated that the ss corrosion resistance in artificial seawater with s eps r corr r ct r f was 11 times higher than that of ss without s eps from 10 to 30 d table 2 these electrochemical results suggested that s eps adsorbed onto the ss surface and then formed a thin film and that the adsorption film was equivalent to adding an interfacial resistance onto the ss surface the inhibitor film the adsorption film offered capacitive impedance and a physical barrier to block the aggression of the corrosive ions such as so4 2 cl and br in seawater from contacting the ss surface table 2 the c c value of inhibitor film decreased over time table 2 indicating that s eps had lasting corrosion resistance the n1 value table 2 was also higher in the presence of s eps and taken together these results indicated that s eps reduced the ss surface roughness and minimized pathways through which ions could be transferred to the underlying ss surface variations over time in the inhibition efficiency η of the inhibitor film on ss corrosion are shown in fig 2h and the inhibition effect of b cereus s eps on ss corrosion seems clear fig 2h the inhibition efficiency of s eps was 65 58 at 1 d fig 2h as time progressed r ct with and without s eps first increased from 1 to 5 d and then decreased from 5 to 30 d table 2 a slight decrease of r ct with s eps appeared after 5 d while r ct without s eps decreased more clearly so that the corrosion inhibition efficiency still increased by means of equation 1 after 10 and 30 d the inhibition efficiencies respectively reached 91 05 and 91 16 fig 2h indicating that the s eps inhibition films were relatively stable and that the corrosion inhibition effect was durable surface morphology analysis further showed that s eps inhibitor films displayed good barrier performance fig 2i and j in artificial seawater without s eps many pits on the ss surface could be seen after 10 d due to the attack of corrosive ions fig 2i while in comparison the ss surface in the presence of s eps was smooth fig 2j under fesem the morphology also indicated that s eps worked as a corrosion barrier for the ss fig 2i and j particularly s eps inhibited ss pitting 3 2 2 effect of different s eps concentrations on ss corrosion inhibition the eis of ss in artificial seawater with different concentrations of s eps secreted by b cereus after 10 d at 28 c are presented in fig 3 the diameter of the semicircle increased initially and then decreased with increased of s eps content fig 3a in the presence of s eps the maximum phase angle was between 71 and 73 in a broad frequency range while this closed to 70 in artificial seawater without s eps fig 3b indicating that s eps inhibited ss corrosion in the bode diagram the stability of the constant phase element q was related to the double layer capacitance in the high frequency which was associated with surface roughness and an oxide passive layer in the medium and low frequency fig 3b shows that the constant phase element q 2 remained stable from medium to low frequency an overlapping characteristic at the different s eps concentrations owing to surface roughness reduction in different s eps concentrations the q 2 remained stable in the medium and low frequency ranges which was a typical corrosion resistant behavior the q 2 was converted to cc using the parallel resistance method shown in equation 2 the cc decreased in the presence of 40 70 mg l s eps which showed that the s eps inhibition film corrosion resistance increased although the cc with 80 mg l s eps was slightly lower than that with 70 mg l s eps the corrosion inhibition efficiency was still high 94 55 and it was close to the corrosion inhibition efficiency of 60 94 61 and 70 mg l 94 90 s eps table 3 furthermore as the s eps concentration increased the r ct increased first from 40 to 70 mg l s eps and then slightly decreased from 70 to 80 mg l s eps the r ct decrease at 80 mg l s eps may have been due to the rearrangement of corrosion inhibitor molecules in high concentration s eps on the ss surface leading to the decreased activation energy barrier yang et al 2008 in summary these results indicated that s eps formed a homogeneous protective film which impeded the corrosion reaction on the ss surface 3 3 performance of s eps for scale inhibition 3 3 1 evaluation of s eps anti scale effect the s eps scale inhibition performance was investigated at doses ranging from 10 to 80 mg l at 70 c for 24 h using a static scale inhibition test the inhibition efficiency of the prepared s eps solutions vs caco3 scale growth in various scale inhibitor concentrations is shown in fig 4 as the s eps dose increased the scale inhibition efficiency increased up to 87 60 at 80 mg l s eps the caco3 scale formation was possibly inhibited by the carboxyl amino and hydroxyl s eps groups binding with the multivalent cations ca2 that is s eps have excellent chelating abilities and so ca2 ions may tend to bind with s eps which breaks the dissolution equilibrium of caco3 caco3 ca2 co3 2 kawaguchi and decho 2002 reported that eps of schizothrix sp inhibited caco3 precipitation in marine stromatolites possibly owing to acidic functional groups in the eps inhibiting calcification by binding ca2 ions 3 3 2 scale crystal morphology analysis scale crystal morphology was observed using fesem fig 5 the sample without s eps showed irregular morphology fig 5a as seen in the rhomb shaped crystals in the red box and disorderly granular crystal in the blue box which seemed to be growing towards the rhomb shape crystal however the crystals morphologies changed after adding 80 mg l b cereus s eps fig 5b the caco3 crystallization calcium scale structures crystal size distribution and crystal morphology have all changed in the solution containing the b cereus s eps owing to changed crystal formation and nucleus generation processes and to changed amounts of crystal nucleus growth these changes were most likely brought about by the powerful affinities of the rich s eps carboxylic acid and amino groups binding multivalent cations ca2 due to their excellent chelating abilities as s eps chelates free ca2 ions in solution furthermore b cereus s eps can be tightly adsorbed onto the active caco3 crystal surface growth sites by van der waals forces and or electrostatic interaction yu et al 2018 this leads to calcium carbonate based biomineralization and in this way b cereus s eps inhibit caco3 scale crystals growth 3 3 3 synergistic effect of calcium and s eps the surface elementary composition of the crystals in the presence of s eps was determined with xps fig 6 shows that the three elements comprising caco3 crystal that is c o and ca as well as n coming from s eps were observed the xps ca2p core level spectrum had two peaks identified as ca2p 3 2 346 47 ev and ca2p 1 2 349 98 ev the c 1s peak fig 6a was resolved into five component peaks with the peak at 284 8 ev corresponding to the c h c o c from lipids or amino acid side chains the peak at 286 28 ev to c oh the peak at 288 08 to o c n from amines or amides and o c o from carboxylic acid carboxylate or ester showing peaks at 292 28 and 292 88 respectively szcześ et al 2016 the n 1s peak was observed on the main peaks at 399 46 ev and 401 28 ev which were assigned to n c o and nh3 szcześ et al 2016 the o 1s peak at 531 06 ev was attributed to either caco3 or c o and o c o from carboxylic acid carboxylate carbonyl or amide szcześ et al 2016 and the peak at 335 ev was attributed to c oh c o c essentially reflecting polysaccharides these findings implied that the growth morphology and size of calcium carbonate crystals in solution with s eps were related to proteoglycans to understanding the interaction mechanism between s eps and ca2 ions more closely an approach combining fluorescence titrimetric and computational chemistry was used to analyze s eps coupled with ca2 ions coordination referring to the excitation emission wavelength boundaries the eem was divided into five regions chen et al 2003 fig 7 a and b shows the eem spectra of s eps and of s eps combined with ca2 ions to form complexes eps ca respectively s eps were identified as excitation emission 280 290 300 380 nm peak a and 320 325 400 410 nm peak b peaks fig 7a peak a belongs to tryptophan and protein like substances in s eps regions iv and was caused by the tryptophan residues in the proteins sheng et al 2013 chen et al 2003 peak b was ascribed to the humic acids in s eps regions v peak b content was peak a sheng et al 2013 chen et al 2003 suggesting that the tryptophan in b cereus s eps played a key role as a natural fluorescence probe fig 7b presents the eem fluorescence spectrum after adding s eps in the scale experiment the absorption wavelength has been red shifted and fluorescence intensity increased in the presence ca2 ions in solution indicating that the formation of complexes the fluorescence wavelength red shift was mainly attributed to intramolecular charge transfer and energy transfer effects lee et al 2015 while ca2 ions were able to simultaneously enhance the fluorescence effect the fluorescence area of each eem spectrum region was calculated using the comprehensive index of regional fluorescence intensity fri normal sized excitation emission area volumes φi n φt n a multiplication factor for each region mfi and percent fluorescence response pi n were calculated using equations 4 6 chen et al 2003 4 φ i n mf i φ i 5 φ t n i 1 5 φ i n 6 p i n φ i n φ t n 100 regions i ii and iv had no fluorescence peaks in either case while the volumetric fluorescence distribution among regions iv and v i e pi n is presented in fig 7e where in the presence of ca2 ions the pi n has increased in region iv while decreasing in region v compared with the s eps this suggested that tryptophan and protein like substances played a leading role in s eps based scale inhibition with the addition of ca2 the eps ca complex inhibited intramolecular charge transfer and or energy transfer so that the nitrogen atoms in the solution could not transfer charge and energy effectively lee et al 2015 ghosh et al 2018 fig 7c displays that fluorescence intensity at the 280 365 nm peak increased with the increased presence of ca2 ions while at peak 320 400 nm fluorescence intensity increased initially and then decreased with increased s eps however the fluorescence intensity of the tryptophan and protein like substance decreased fig 7d indicating that on balance s eps have strong complexation ability with ca2 ions and that tryptophan and protein like substances play a major role in s eps the fact that fluorescence intensity was higher in the presence of ca2 ions than for s eps solution alone may be related to a coordination effect in which ca2 ions coordinated with the tryptophan and protein like substances in s eps to destroy intramolecular hydrogen bonds and increase molecular rigidity thus non radiative transitions were reduced which increased the fluorescence quantum yields charges arrangements have been explored to examine both the binding sites between metal and s eps and the electron shared mechanism associated with metal eps coordination based on the fluorescence and ftir spectral data the glytrp cluster in s eps and ca2 taken as the two fragments were computed fig 8 shows that all the o and n atoms of glytrp in s eps had higher negative charges which suggested that s eps provided many ca2 ions binding sites as n electronegativity was higher than that of o ca2 ions would preferentially bind with n so that eps ca coordination was linked to n from deprotonated glytrp residues in s eps overall these results confirmed that the interactions of ca2 ions and glytrp were responsible for eps ca coordination 3 4 general discussion on s eps corrosion and scale inhibition mechanisms ca scale formation usually occurs on metal surface in seawater accompanied by the corrosion reaction ss corrosion has been ascribed to the destruction of a passive film by corrosive anions and this mechanism has been described as having three steps passive film penetration film breaking and adsorption wang et al 2012 the corrosion reactions are as follows wang et al 2012 fe fe2 2e anodic reaction o2 h2o 4e 4oh cathodic reaction ca scale was formed due to the presence of ca2 and co3 2 in seawater al sabagh et al 2018 and occurs through a series of steps which include the formation of ca2 and co3 2 ion pairs micro aggregate formation micro crystal macro crystal and finally scale deposit formation gao et al 2015 ca scale also has a role in promoting metal corrosion in this study we have provided evidence that s eps played key roles in inhibiting calcium carbonate formation and in anti corrosion and have shown that s eps interfered with the scale formation process and corrosive anion aggression in seawater the main functional groups in s eps samples have been identified as o h and n h groups amide i carboxylic groups and c o c fig 1a which can chelate multivalent cation and form films on the ss surface wang et al 2014 the hetero atoms n o and π electrons e g phenyl and unsaturated aliphatic groups have excess negative charge and this improves the opportunity for the adsorption process to form a protective layer over the ss surface al sabagh et al 2018 thus improving inhibition corrosion efficiency with the specific mechanism is shown in fig 9 in this process negatively charged functional groups in s eps such as nh2 cooh c o c and oh initially adsorb metal ions capable of positive charge and form complexes shou et al 2018 sheng et al 2013 the metal polymer interaction mechanism is similar in this sense as when acting in ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid or pectin subsequently s eps interacts with metal ions by oxidation and precipitation to form a biomineralized film covering the ss surface which inhibits ss corrosion fig 9a this biomineralization film can hinder electron transfer and reject corrosive ion attack s eps inhibiting corrosion is a complex process that relies on both the s eps concentration and the environmental physiochemical conditions evaluation of s eps anticorrosion properties in seawater over varying times has shown that this biomineralized film provides lasting the barrier protection and pitting inhibition properties fig 2 furthermore caco3 scale growth inhibition by b cereus s eps has been shown to be related to their ability to chelate multivalent cations since carboxylic acid and amino groups have strong affinities with ca2 ions gao et al 2015 unlike in the corrosion inhibition mechanism s eps may alter the kinetic pathways of mineral nucleation and crystal growth by interaction with ca2 ions to inhibit the caco3 scale formation in geology field studies have shown that total eps facilitate caco3 mineral precipitation in biogenic mineral precipitation processes and different crystal morphologies have been observed braissant et al 2009 in contrast to these observations other studies have shown that aqueous s eps could adsorb tightly onto crystal surface active growth sites in soft marine stromatolites which inhibited crystal growth kawaguchi and decho 2002 zippel and neu 2010 decho 2010 furthermore kawaguchi and decho 2002 speculated that s eps inhibition of caco3 crystal precipitation was related to uronic acids and protein fractions overall then promotion or inhibition of calcium carbonate formation in biomineralization by eps may be related to many factors including the eps concentration the specific eps functional groups present the types of eps and ph knowing this we believe that caco3 crystal precipitation or dissolution can be achieved by controlling these conditions here we have put forward a new idea to inhibit the formation of calcium scale in water using s eps secreted by bacteria we found that the inhibition efficiency of s eps on caco3 formation was low in low s eps concentrations while s eps showed good inhibitory effect on the formation of calcium carbonate at higher s eps concentrations this suggested and this is the first time such a suggestion has been put forward that s eps could be used as a calcium carbonate scale inhibitor in this study different morphologies were observed in the presence and absence of s eps fig 5 suggesting that s eps inhibited caco3 crystal precipitation by controlling and or altering mineral nucleation and crystal growth moreover eem and computation results showed that s eps and ca2 ions had strong complexation ability ca2 ions can complex with the tryptophan protein like substances and humic acids in s eps among which tryptophan and protein like substances play a significant role therefore we propose that tryptophan and protein like substances in s eps inhibit caco3 crystal precipitation by controlling caco3 morphology and biomineralization processes compared with some other reported inhibitors for fe alloys in seawater and cooling water such as sodium lignosulfonate and hexa anionic surfactant table 4 the corrosion inhibition effect of s eps was more satisfactory furthermore from table 5 it can see that s eps were more effective in inhibiting caco3 scale formation than other scale inhibitors e g sodium lignosulfonate starch grafy poly arylic acid thus s eps can be seen as good bio functional scale and corrosion inhibitors with potential to replace some chemical synthesis inhibitors 4 conclusion in summary this study has shown that b cereus s eps are dual bio functional materials for corrosion and scale inhibition with increased s eps concentration the r ct and η values initially increased and then slightly decreased the corrosion inhibition efficiency in relation to ss calculated by charge transfer resistance were calulated to be 91 05 with 40 mg l s eps at 10 d and 91 16 at 30 d the s eps ss corrosion inhibiting effect was due to the adsorption of the oxygen atoms by functional groups e g o h c o c and amide i as was shown by ft ir spectra s eps were seen to interact with metal ions to form a biomineralized film covering the ss surface which inhibited ss corrosion furthermore these negatively charged functional groups stopped caco3 growth and inhibited calcium scale crystal formation and growth by adsorbing onto the caco3 active growth centers or and combining with ca2 ions we have shown that tryptophan and protein like substances in soluble s eps play a leading role in inhibiting caco3 crystal precipitate indicating that s eps are a potential alternative to conventional chemical scale and corrosion inhibitors in industry due to their ease of biodegradability high efficiency non toxicity and non secondary pollution in the future s eps are expected to be loaded onto new materials to form nanocomposites for bionic anti corrosion coatings and or anti scale materials to improve the anti corrosion and anti scale performance

18488,in this study soluble extracellular polymeric substances s eps secreted by bacillus cereus b cereus were studied as a novel dual bio functional corrosion and scale inhibiting material in artificial seawater static tests showed that the scale inhibition efficiency si was close to 87 60 for caco3 at the concentration of 80 mg l s eps electrochemical technique results showed that s eps inhibition efficiencies in relation to 316l stainless steel ss and at the concentration of 40 mg l reached 91 05 at 10 d and 91 16 at 30 d respectively the high anti scale and anti corrosion performance of s eps was related to their chelating adsorption and biomineralization abilities s eps integrated with metal ions on the ss surface resulting in formation of a thin but dense biomineralized film which exhibited lasting corrosion resistance meanwhile s eps controlled the kinetic pathway of caco3 biomineralized nucleation and crystal growth which inhibited caco3 crystal precipitation this finding suggests that b cereus s eps may offer a green sustainable and economic strategy for anti corrosion and anti scale application in industry graphical abstract image 1 keywords soluble eps scale inhibitor corrosion inhibitor biomineralization bacillus cereus 1 introduction water shortages are becoming a global issue and use of seawater resource is one of the effective mitigation responses tang et al 2019 unfortunately equipment corrosion and scale have been an unavoidable aspect of desalination processes and also of seawater cooling systems which limit seawater utilization hoseinieh et al 2017 deyab et al 2019 corrosion and scale not only reduce heat exchange efficiency and service life but also increase water contamination kıcır et al 2016 thus a combined measure that can simultaneously protect desalination units from corrosion and scale deposition is required inhibitors are usually thought to be an efficient way to control both scale deposition and material corrosion multiple corrosion and scale inhibitor types such as organic phosphine organic phosphonate and polycarboxylic acid have been widely used ituen et al 2017 corrosion and scale inhibitors can be classified as either phosphorus containing or phosphorus free inhibitors with the former being the most popular worldwide due to their cost effective performance yu et al 2018 chaussemier et al 2015 most are non biodegradable however leading to heavy eutrophication and increased biofouling of membrane systems with the high cost of synthesis chaussemier et al 2015 hence it is necessary to develop new eco friendly corrosion and scale inhibitors with high inhibition efficiencies carboxylic hydroxylic and acylamido polymer groups have exhibited high scale and corrosion inhibition performance due to their strong ion chelation zhang et al 2016a yu et al 2018 gao et al 2015 organic matters secreted by bacteria may be potential corrosion and scale inhibitors azizi et al 2017 as they contain large amounts of these functional groups in particular extracellular polymeric substances eps a mixture of polymers with high molecular weight mainly composed of polysaccharides proteins humic like substances nucleic acid lipids and glycoproteins wang et al 2018 are easy to attach firmly to solid surfaces and form thin films belando et al 2017 thus an eps film may work as transport barrier to prevent the penetration by corrosive agents e g oxygen and chloride and decrease corrosive ions contact with metal surfaces meanwhile the acid function group substances in eps such as humic like substance and proteins have strong complexing ability with calcium ions sheng et al 2013 which may inhibit scale formation eps are classified into two types soluble eps s eps and bound eps according to the eps physical adhesion to cells and extraction difficulty comte et al 2006 their chemical compositions are similar but s eps have superior characteristics including biodegradability strong biosorption affinity great ability to exchange protonic ions and multiple fixation sites comte et al 2006 significantly s eps are a cheap easily extracted and abundant bio renewable resource yu et al 2009 suggesting that s eps have great potential for anti corrosion and scale inhibition bacillus cereus b cereus is widespread and grows easily in nature huang et al 2016 b cereus and its eps are able to adsorb onto various surfaces such as stainless steel floors conveyer belts and carbon steel and form biofilms huang et al 2016 and recently b cereus biofilm was found to inhibit stainless steel corrosion in seawater li et al 2019 eps account for 90 of the biofilm liu et al 2007 thus the role of eps should not be ignored in this context overall b cereus s eps have the potential to form complexes with inorganic ions to simultaneously inhibit metal corrosion and to control calcium carbonate formation literature available to date about s eps as corrosion and scale inhibitors is scarce so in the study described here a novel green approach to stainless steel protection and caco3 formation prevention based on s eps induced biomineralization has been proposed for the first time the intention of this study was to provide a new idea for the development of sustainable and environmentally friendly anti corrosion and scale inhibition materials s eps were extracted from b cereus supernatant using physical methods and its corrosion and scale inhibiting properties were evaluated on 316l stainless steel ss in artificial seawater electrochemical tests surface analysis and static tests showed that s eps could be used as dual bio functional corrosion and scale inhibitors in seawater environments and suggested that s eps have potential prospect for application to industrial scale prevention and corrosion inhibition 2 materials and methods 2 1 media and growth conditions of b cereus and s eps extraction aerobic b cereus strain was provided by the

the morphologies of ss specimens after immersion in artificial seawater for 10 d with and without s eps were observed with a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem nova nanosem 450 fei before measurement samples were dehydrated successively in different proportions of ethanol solutions 20 50 75 99 and 100 for 10 min the samples s eps and absorption of s eps on the surface of ss were

experiments were conducted in triplicate on different samples to ensure reproducibility 2 7 fesem xps and fluorescent spectrophotometer analysis molar equivalent solutions from cacl2 2h2o 0 125 m and nahco3 0 125 m with and without s eps were magnetically stirred up to precipitation subsequently caco3 crystals were collected using a 0 22 μm membrane and examined the caco3 crystal shapes with and without s eps were observed with fesem nova nanosem 450 fei while x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps kα thermo was performed to evaluate caco3 crystal valence variation in the presence of s eps the electron binding energy scales of the acquired spectra were calibrated for a maximum of c 1s core excitation at 284 6 ev to reveal eps ca interaction thermodynamic parameters s eps and mixed solutions

triplicate to ensure reproducibility 2 8 computational chemistry computation was used to elucidate the complex bonding sites and bonding energies to demonstrate shared electrons and to deduce eps ca coordination mechanisms oligopeptide glytrp including a tryptophan residue and glycine was built based on the fluorescence and ftir spectral data shou et al 2018 herein glycine was chosen based on its high abundance in s eps and simple structure glytrp has a completely functional protein structure containing a carboxyl residue an amino residue and a peptide shou et al 2018 molecular models were built using the gaussian 09 software and the molecular structure of glytrp was optimized at the b3lyp def2tzvp level 34 using the gaussian 09 package shou et al 2018 ca2 ions can freely move around the carboxyl residue amino residue and peptide 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of s eps and s eps film formation adsorbed on ss surfaces the ftir spectra of s eps are presented in fig 1 a and five main peaks identified the main functional groups in the s eps samples were deduced to be these at 2960 3300 1620 1400 and 1120 cm 1 wang et al 2014 of these a broad stretching vibration band in the 2960 3300 cm 1 was assigned to an n h amino group of proteins and an o h groups of carbohydrates wei et al 2016 the peak at 1400 cm 1 was the symmetric stretching peak of the carboxylic acid with ionic groups wang et al 2014 the absorption band at 1620 cm 1 corresponded to the c o stretching vibration of the amide i of the polypeptides wang et al 2014 the band near 1120 cm 1 was attributed to c o c stretching vibrations from the carbohydrates and aromatics kavita et al 2011 the adsorption peak at 660 cm 1 was related to stretching of alkyl halides kavita et al 2011 these results implied that s eps were a complex high molecular weight mixture of polymers that is humic substances and uronic and nucleic acids s eps have potential anti corrosive properties since they contain oxygen atoms in functional groups o h c o c and amide i and therefore satisfied with the general criteria for typical corrosion inhibitors gualdrón et al 2013 considering s eps adsorption onto ss surfaces fig 1b compared to fig 1a many differences could be seen the 3300 1620 and 1400 cm 1 peaks have been the red shifted to 3400 1420 and 1640 cm 1 respectively while the peak at 1120 cm 1 had split into 1150 and 1010 cm 1 fig 1b and the 660 and 551 cm 1 peaks had disappeared these changes associated with carboxyl amino and oxhydryl groups showed that the carboxyl amino and oxhydryl groups in s eps were involved in the formation of metal eps coordination 3 2 s eps corrosion inhibition performance 3 2 1 evaluation of s eps anti corrosion effect the anti corrosion performance of s eps was evaluated using electrochemical techniques and surface analysis fig 2 a e shows ss eis in artificial seawater with and without s eps cs eps 40 mg l at different times in the presence of s eps the diameters of the semicircles were significantly larger than they were in s eps absence fig 2a e the result suggested that b cereus s eps significantly inhibited ss corrosion in artificial seawater which could be attributed to the adsorption of s eps onto the ss surface the nyquist fig 2a e showed no shape distinction between with or without s eps which was attributed to the capacitive arc of the s eps film covering the capacitive arc of the passivating film but also reflected the electrochemical processes at different interfaces in general impedance spectra were analyzed using an equivalent circuit considering the contribution of each phenomenon e g the electrical double layer i e edl and film formation li et al 2019 corresponding eis data were fitted using the equivalent circuits as shown in fig 2f without s eps and fig 2g with s eps in the presence of s eps a one time constant fig 2f represented the oxidation film protective layer on the ss surface which was determined by the electrode process on the ss substrate the two time constant equivalent circuit was used to represent duplex surface film formation on the ss surface in the presence of s eps an outer layer of inhibitor film and an inner oxidation film fig 2g electrochemical parameters the solution resistance r s the charge transfer resistance r ct the film resistance r f the constant phase element of double layer capacitance q 1 and the constant phase element of s eps film q 2 were listed in table 2 fitting analysis results also indicated that the ss corrosion resistance in artificial seawater with s eps r corr r ct r f was 11 times higher than that of ss without s eps from 10 to 30 d table 2 these electrochemical results suggested that s eps adsorbed onto the ss surface and then formed a thin film and that the adsorption film was equivalent to adding an interfacial resistance onto the ss surface the inhibitor film the adsorption film offered capacitive impedance and a physical barrier to block the aggression of the corrosive ions such as so4 2 cl and br in seawater from contacting the ss surface table 2 the c c value of inhibitor film decreased over time table 2 indicating that s eps had lasting corrosion resistance the n1 value table 2 was also higher in the presence of s eps and taken together these results indicated that s eps reduced the ss surface roughness and minimized pathways through which ions could be transferred to the underlying ss surface variations over time in the inhibition efficiency η of the inhibitor film on ss corrosion are shown in fig 2h and the inhibition effect of b cereus s eps on ss corrosion seems clear fig 2h the inhibition efficiency of s eps was 65 58 at 1 d fig 2h as time progressed r ct with and without s eps first increased from 1 to 5 d and then decreased from 5 to 30 d table 2 a slight decrease of r ct with s eps appeared after 5 d while r ct without s eps decreased more clearly so that the corrosion inhibition efficiency still increased by means of equation 1 after 10 and 30 d the inhibition efficiencies respectively reached 91 05 and 91 16 fig 2h indicating that the s eps inhibition films were relatively stable and that the corrosion inhibition effect was durable surface morphology analysis further showed that s eps inhibitor films displayed good barrier performance fig 2i and j in artificial seawater without s eps many pits on the ss surface could be seen after 10 d due to the attack of corrosive ions fig 2i while in comparison the ss surface in the presence of s eps was smooth fig 2j under fesem the morphology also indicated that s eps worked as a corrosion barrier for the ss fig 2i and j particularly s eps inhibited ss pitting 3 2 2 effect of different s eps concentrations on ss corrosion inhibition the eis of ss in artificial seawater with different concentrations of s eps secreted by b cereus after 10 d at 28 c are presented in fig 3 the diameter of the semicircle increased initially and then decreased with increased of s eps content fig 3a in the presence of s eps the maximum phase angle was between 71 and 73 in a broad frequency range while this closed to 70 in artificial seawater without s eps fig 3b indicating that s eps inhibited ss corrosion in the bode diagram the stability of the constant phase element q was related to the double layer capacitance in the high frequency which was associated with surface roughness and an oxide passive layer in the medium and low frequency fig 3b shows that the constant phase element q 2 remained stable from medium to low frequency an overlapping characteristic at the different s eps concentrations owing to surface roughness reduction in different s eps concentrations the q 2 remained stable in the medium and low frequency ranges which was a typical corrosion resistant behavior the q 2 was converted to cc using the parallel resistance method shown in equation 2 the cc decreased in the presence of 40 70 mg l s eps which showed that the s eps inhibition film corrosion resistance increased although the cc with 80 mg l s eps was slightly lower than that with 70 mg l s eps the corrosion inhibition efficiency was still high 94 55 and it was close to the corrosion inhibition efficiency of 60 94 61 and 70 mg l 94 90 s eps table 3 furthermore as the s eps concentration increased the r ct increased first from 40 to 70 mg l s eps and then slightly decreased from 70 to 80 mg l s eps the r ct decrease at 80 mg l s eps may have been due to the rearrangement of corrosion inhibitor molecules in high concentration s eps on the ss surface leading to the decreased activation energy barrier yang et al 2008 in summary these results indicated that s eps formed a homogeneous protective film which impeded the corrosion reaction on the ss surface 3 3 performance of s eps for scale inhibition 3 3 1 evaluation of s eps anti scale effect the s eps scale inhibition performance was investigated at doses ranging from 10 to 80 mg l at 70 c for 24 h using a static scale inhibition test the inhibition efficiency of the prepared s eps solutions vs caco3 scale growth in various scale inhibitor concentrations is shown in fig 4 as the s eps dose increased the scale inhibition efficiency increased up to 87 60 at 80 mg l s eps the caco3 scale formation was possibly inhibited by the carboxyl amino and hydroxyl s eps groups binding with the multivalent cations ca2 that is s eps have excellent chelating abilities and so ca2 ions may tend to bind with s eps which breaks the dissolution equilibrium of caco3 caco3 ca2 co3 2 kawaguchi and decho 2002 reported that eps of schizothrix sp inhibited caco3 precipitation in marine stromatolites possibly owing to acidic functional groups in the eps inhibiting calcification by binding ca2 ions 3 3 2 scale crystal morphology analysis scale crystal morphology was observed using fesem fig 5 the sample without s eps showed irregular morphology fig 5a as seen in the rhomb shaped crystals in the red box and disorderly granular crystal in the blue box which seemed to be growing towards the rhomb shape crystal however the crystals morphologies changed after adding 80 mg l b cereus s eps fig 5b the caco3 crystallization calcium scale structures crystal size distribution and crystal morphology have all changed in the solution containing the b cereus s eps owing to changed crystal formation and nucleus generation processes and to changed amounts of crystal nucleus growth these changes were most likely brought about by the powerful affinities of the rich s eps carboxylic acid and amino groups binding multivalent cations ca2 due to their excellent chelating abilities as s eps chelates free ca2 ions in solution furthermore b cereus s eps can be tightly adsorbed onto the active caco3 crystal surface growth sites by van der waals forces and or electrostatic interaction yu et al 2018 this leads to calcium carbonate based biomineralization and in this way b cereus s eps inhibit caco3 scale crystals growth 3 3 3 synergistic effect of calcium and s eps the surface elementary composition of the crystals in the presence of s eps was determined with xps fig 6 shows that the three elements comprising caco3 crystal that is c o and ca as well as n coming from s eps were observed the xps ca2p core level spectrum had two peaks identified as ca2p 3 2 346 47 ev and ca2p 1 2 349 98 ev the c 1s peak fig 6a was resolved into five component peaks with the peak at 284 8 ev corresponding to the c h c o c from lipids or amino acid side chains the peak at 286 28 ev to c oh the peak at 288 08 to o c n from amines or amides and o c o from carboxylic acid carboxylate or ester showing peaks at 292 28 and 292 88 respectively szcześ et al 2016 the n 1s peak was observed on the main peaks at 399 46 ev and 401 28 ev which were assigned to n c o and nh3 szcześ et al 2016 the o 1s peak at 531 06 ev was attributed to either caco3 or c o and o c o from carboxylic acid carboxylate carbonyl or amide szcześ et al 2016 and the peak at 335 ev was attributed to c oh c o c essentially reflecting polysaccharides these findings implied that the growth morphology and size of calcium carbonate crystals in solution with s eps were related to proteoglycans to understanding the interaction mechanism between s eps and ca2 ions more closely an approach combining fluorescence titrimetric and computational chemistry was used to analyze s eps coupled with ca2 ions coordination referring to the excitation emission wavelength boundaries the eem was divided into five regions chen et al 2003 fig 7 a and b shows the eem spectra of s eps and of s eps combined with ca2 ions to form complexes eps ca respectively s eps were identified as excitation emission 280 290 300 380 nm peak a and 320 325 400 410 nm peak b peaks fig 7a peak a belongs to tryptophan and protein like substances in s eps regions iv and was caused by the tryptophan residues in the proteins sheng et al 2013 chen et al 2003 peak b was ascribed to the humic acids in s eps regions v peak b content was peak a sheng et al 2013 chen et al 2003 suggesting that the tryptophan in b cereus s eps played a key role as a natural fluorescence probe fig 7b presents the eem fluorescence spectrum after adding s eps in the scale experiment the absorption wavelength has been red shifted and fluorescence intensity increased in the presence ca2 ions in solution indicating that the formation of complexes the fluorescence wavelength red shift was mainly attributed to intramolecular charge transfer and energy transfer effects lee et al 2015 while ca2 ions were able to simultaneously enhance the fluorescence effect the fluorescence area of each eem spectrum region was calculated using the comprehensive index of regional fluorescence intensity fri normal sized excitation emission area volumes φi n φt n a multiplication factor for each region mfi and percent fluorescence response pi n were calculated using equations 4 6 chen et al 2003 4 φ i n mf i φ i 5 φ t n i 1 5 φ i n 6 p i n φ i n φ t n 100 regions i ii and iv had no fluorescence peaks in either case while the volumetric fluorescence distribution among regions iv and v i e pi n is presented in fig 7e where in the presence of ca2 ions the pi n has increased in region iv while decreasing in region v compared with the s eps this suggested that tryptophan and protein like substances played a leading role in s eps based scale inhibition with the addition of ca2 the eps ca complex inhibited intramolecular charge transfer and or energy transfer so that the nitrogen atoms in the solution could not transfer charge and energy effectively lee et al 2015 ghosh et al 2018 fig 7c displays that fluorescence intensity at the 280 365 nm peak increased with the increased presence of ca2 ions while at peak 320 400 nm fluorescence intensity increased initially and then decreased with increased s eps however the fluorescence intensity of the tryptophan and protein like substance decreased fig 7d indicating that on balance s eps have strong complexation ability with ca2 ions and that tryptophan and protein like substances play a major role in s eps the fact that fluorescence intensity was higher in the presence of ca2 ions than for s eps solution alone may be related to a coordination effect in which ca2 ions coordinated with the tryptophan and protein like substances in s eps to destroy intramolecular hydrogen bonds and increase molecular rigidity thus non radiative transitions were reduced which increased the fluorescence quantum yields charges arrangements have been explored to examine both the binding sites between metal and s eps and the electron shared mechanism associated with metal eps coordination based on the fluorescence and ftir spectral data the glytrp cluster in s eps and ca2 taken as the two fragments were computed fig 8 shows that all the o and n atoms of glytrp in s eps had higher negative charges which suggested that s eps provided many ca2 ions binding sites as n electronegativity was higher than that of o ca2 ions would preferentially bind with n so that eps ca coordination was linked to n from deprotonated glytrp residues in s eps overall these results confirmed that the interactions of ca2 ions and glytrp were responsible for eps ca coordination 3 4 general discussion on s eps corrosion and scale inhibition mechanisms ca scale formation usually occurs on metal surface in seawater accompanied by the corrosion reaction ss corrosion has been ascribed to the destruction of a passive film by corrosive anions and this mechanism has been described as having three steps passive film penetration film breaking and adsorption wang et al 2012 the corrosion reactions are as follows wang et al 2012 fe fe2 2e anodic reaction o2 h2o 4e 4oh cathodic reaction ca scale was formed due to the presence of ca2 and co3 2 in seawater al sabagh et al 2018 and occurs through a series of steps which include the formation of ca2 and co3 2 ion pairs micro aggregate formation micro crystal macro crystal and finally scale deposit formation gao et al 2015 ca scale also has a role in promoting metal corrosion in this study we have provided evidence that s eps played key roles in inhibiting calcium carbonate formation and in anti corrosion and have shown that s eps interfered with the scale formation process and corrosive anion aggression in seawater the main functional groups in s eps samples have been identified as o h and n h groups amide i carboxylic groups and c o c fig 1a which can chelate multivalent cation and form films on the ss surface wang et al 2014 the hetero atoms n o and π electrons e g phenyl and unsaturated aliphatic groups have excess negative charge and this improves the opportunity for the adsorption process to form a protective layer over the ss surface al sabagh et al 2018 thus improving inhibition corrosion efficiency with the specific mechanism is shown in fig 9 in this process negatively charged functional groups in s eps such as nh2 cooh c o c and oh initially adsorb metal ions capable of positive charge and form complexes shou et al 2018 sheng et al 2013 the metal polymer interaction mechanism is similar in this sense as when acting in ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid or pectin subsequently s eps interacts with metal ions by oxidation and precipitation to form a biomineralized film covering the ss surface which inhibits ss corrosion fig 9a this biomineralization film can hinder electron transfer and reject corrosive ion attack s eps inhibiting corrosion is a complex process that relies on both the s eps concentration and the environmental physiochemical conditions evaluation of s eps anticorrosion properties in seawater over varying times has shown that this biomineralized film provides lasting the barrier protection and pitting inhibition properties fig 2 furthermore caco3 scale growth inhibition by b cereus s eps has been shown to be related to their ability to chelate multivalent cations since carboxylic acid and amino groups have strong affinities with ca2 ions gao et al 2015 unlike in the corrosion inhibition mechanism s eps may alter the kinetic pathways of mineral nucleation and crystal growth by interaction with ca2 ions to inhibit the caco3 scale formation in geology field studies have shown that total eps facilitate caco3 mineral precipitation in biogenic mineral precipitation processes and different crystal morphologies have been observed braissant et al 2009 in contrast to these observations other studies have shown that aqueous s eps could adsorb tightly onto crystal surface active growth sites in soft marine stromatolites which inhibited crystal growth kawaguchi and decho 2002 zippel and neu 2010 decho 2010 furthermore kawaguchi and decho 2002 speculated that s eps inhibition of caco3 crystal precipitation was related to uronic acids and protein fractions overall then promotion or inhibition of calcium carbonate formation in biomineralization by eps may be related to many factors including the eps concentration the specific eps functional groups present the types of eps and ph knowing this we believe that caco3 crystal precipitation or dissolution can be achieved by controlling these conditions here we have put forward a new idea to inhibit the formation of calcium scale in water using s eps secreted by bacteria we found that the inhibition efficiency of s eps on caco3 formation was low in low s eps concentrations while s eps showed good inhibitory effect on the formation of calcium carbonate at higher s eps concentrations this suggested and this is the first time such a suggestion has been put forward that s eps could be used as a calcium carbonate scale inhibitor in this study different morphologies were observed in the presence and absence of s eps fig 5 suggesting that s eps inhibited caco3 crystal precipitation by controlling and or altering mineral nucleation and crystal growth moreover eem and computation results showed that s eps and ca2 ions had strong complexation ability ca2 ions can complex with the tryptophan protein like substances and humic acids in s eps among which tryptophan and protein like substances play a significant role therefore we propose that tryptophan and protein like substances in s eps inhibit caco3 crystal precipitation by controlling caco3 morphology and biomineralization processes compared with some other reported inhibitors for fe alloys in seawater and cooling water such as sodium lignosulfonate and hexa anionic surfactant table 4 the corrosion inhibition effect of s eps was more satisfactory furthermore from table 5 it can see that s eps were more effective in inhibiting caco3 scale formation than other scale inhibitors e g sodium lignosulfonate starch grafy poly arylic acid thus s eps can be seen as good bio functional scale and corrosion inhibitors with potential to replace some chemical synthesis inhibitors 4 conclusion in summary this study has shown that b cereus s eps are dual bio functional materials for corrosion and scale inhibition with increased s eps concentration the r ct and η values initially increased and then slightly decreased the corrosion inhibition efficiency in relation to ss calculated by charge transfer resistance were calulated to be 91 05 with 40 mg l s eps at 10 d and 91 16 at 30 d the s eps ss corrosion inhibiting effect was due to the adsorption of the oxygen atoms by functional groups e g o h c o c and amide i as was shown by ft ir spectra s eps were seen to interact with metal ions to form a biomineralized film covering the ss surface which inhibited ss corrosion furthermore these negatively charged functional groups stopped caco3 growth and inhibited calcium scale crystal formation and growth by adsorbing onto the caco3 active growth centers or and combining with ca2 ions we have shown that tryptophan and protein like substances in soluble s eps play a leading role in inhibiting caco3 crystal precipitate indicating that s eps are a potential alternative to conventional chemical scale and corrosion inhibitors in industry due to their ease of biodegradability high efficiency non toxicity and non secondary pollution in the future s eps are expected to be loaded onto new materials to form nanocomposites for bionic anti corrosion coatings and or anti scale materials to improve the anti corrosion and anti scale performance

18489,membrane aerated biofilm reactors are becoming more important for nitrogen removal in the wastewater sector one dimensional 1d models are widely used to study the performance of such systems however 1d models are not able to simulate the longitudinal gradients that exist in the reactor although there is experimental evidence that points to the existence of longitudinal gradients simple modeling approaches that consider these gradients are not yet developed this study proposes a novel multi compartment model that simulates the longitudinal substrate and oxygen gradients it assesses the effects of temperature biofilm thickness number of compartments and flow configuration liquid and gas phase on the modeling results additionally it compares the capabilities of a traditional 1d model with those of the novel multi compartment model our results show that a classical 1d model predicts a lower total dissolved nitrogen concentration tdn in the effluent in contrast to the predictions of the multi compartment model in the worst case scenario the tdn predicted by the traditional 1d model was three times lower than the prediction of the multi compartment model the results delivered by the models differ also in the axial gradients the traditional 1d model for example predicted an oxygen concentration at the membrane surface of 0 4 mg o2 l while the multi compartment model predicted a concentration of 2 9 mg o2 l finally the results of this study show that the longitudinal oxygen gradient has an important effect on both biomass distribution and effluent tdn whereas the longitudinal substrate exclusively affected the effluent tdn graphical abstract image 1 keywords membrane aerated biofilm reactor biofilm nitrogen removal oxygen gradient substrate gradient multi compartment model 1 introduction current research is moving towards the implementation of deammonification processes in the mainstream one of the main goals is to develop strategies to overcome frequently encountered operational challenges such as low temperatures around 10 c relatively low nh4 concentrations biomass retention and high c n ratios xu et al 2015 one of the most widespread strategies to deal with those problems is a two stage configuration in the first stage cod is removed until an adequate c n ratio is achieved the effluent produced in this first stage is further treated in a subsequent stage through autotrophic deammonification han et al 2016 xu et al 2015 several processes have been tested for the second stage gilbert et al 2015 hu et al 2013 lotti et al 2015a wang et al 2016 among them also membrane aerated biofilm reactors mabrs and hybrid mabrs seem to be promising technologies peeters et al 2016 therefore mabrs lately regained significance in wastewater treatment in contrast to traditional biofilm reactors which use a co diffusion geometry i e both electron donor and acceptor are supplied via the liquid phase mabrs use a counter diffusion geometry i e the electron acceptor is supplied through the membrane via the gas phase whereas the electron donor is supplied through the liquid phase casey et al 1999 in the case of nitrogen removal from wastewater the diffusion of oxygen and substrates from different sides of the biofilm membrane and bulk liquid respectively creates a uniquely stratified biofilm that is capable of achieving several processes simultaneously e g nitrification and denitrification or partial nitrification and anammox the supply of oxygen from the biofilm base presents several advantages easier oxygen control ni et al 2013 and less n2o emissions kinh et al 2017 being two examples in addition the resistance of the diffusion layer affects the overall mass transfer less in comparison to the co diffusion geometry nerenberg 2016 modeling has proven to be a powerful tool for studying mabrs several research groups have already evaluated the influence of different factors on the performance of mabrs and their microbial communities these studies mainly focused on the axial gradients perpendicular to the membrane surface the optimization of aeration patterns and the behavior of the different geometries co and counter diffusion lackner and smets 2012 liu et al 2016 ni et al 2013 shanahan and semmens 2004 terada et al 2007 conceptual studies on mabrs use multispecies one dimensional models 1d to analyze the reactor performance under the conditions of interest although these models predict the axial characteristics of the biofilm and the axial profiles within it they do not include the ones occurring longitudinally along the length of the reactor resp the membrane there is experimental evidence that oxygen and substrate concentrations change not only in the axial direction but also in the longitudinal direction it has been reported that depending on reactor presence or absence of recirculation and membrane configuration dead end flow through longitudinal substrate and oxygen profiles may appear hibiya et al 2003 martin and nerenberg 2012 pankhania et al 1999 shanahan and semmens 2006 the limitations of the traditional 1d models together with the experimental evidence confirming the occurrence of longitudinal substrate and oxygen gradients disclose an important knowledge gap the impact of longitudinal gradients on the reactor performance remains to our knowledge largely unexplored moreover a simple method to introduce longitudinal gradients into conventional models is still missing this study developed a multi compartment model for completely autotrophic nitrogen removal in aquasim 2 1 reichert 1998 it introduced longitudinal substrate and oxygen gradients allowing the analysis of biofilm characteristics along the length of the reactor as well the model simulated the longitudinal gradients by combining multiple single 1d models with the assumption that mass transfer is perpendicular between membrane and biofilm iwa 2006 in order to compare a 1d model with our multi compartment model different scenarios were proposed temperature airflow gin maximum biofilm thickness lfmax and the number of compartments n took different values in the proposed scenarios additionally several flow configurations counter and co current flow were evaluated to assess the influence of the direction of flow the relative effect of the single inclusion of longitudinal gradients of either oxygen or substrates was also analyzed 2 methodology a mabr for completely autotrophic nitrogen removal was modeled in aquasim 2 1 reichert 1998 a novel multi compartment model was developed to evaluate the effect of longitudinal gradients for substrates and oxygen such gradients were implemented through the division of the biofilm reactor and the membrane lumen in several compartments the total dissolved nitrogen concentration tdn in the effluent and the biomass distribution obtained from the multi compartment model and the traditional 1d models were compared and evaluated 2 1 model set up a multi species model including ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria anaob and heterotroph bacteria hb was considered depending on the electron donor the hb were divided into three groups aerobic nitrite no2 n reducing and nitrate no3 n reducing bacteria monod kinetics were applied for modeling growth and substrate conversion by the respective microorganisms the rates were a function of the specific yield biomass and substrate concentrations biomass decay was simulated using a first order kinetic expression and hydrolysis rates for organic matter and nitrogen were modeled using a simplified rate eqn 1 as previously suggested in lackner et al 2008 1 d x s d t k h x s k x d x n d t k h x n k x where xs and xn are the particulate fractions of organics and nitrogen respectively kh is the hydrolysis rate and kx the half saturation coefficient for the hydrolysis the supplementary material includes a comprehensive summary of all the processes and rates the model used the kinetic parameters according to lackner and smets 2012 both compartments biofilm reactor and membrane lumen were represented as ideally mixed reactors a diffusive link at the biofilm base connected both compartments the oxygen flux jo2 represented by the diffusive link was calculated according to eqn 2 as proposed in casey et al 2000b 2 j o 2 k t o t s o 2 m h s o 2 b f where ktot is the total mass transfer coefficient for oxygen so2m and so2bf are the oxygen concentrations at the membrane and biofilm interface respectively the target tdn in the effluent was set to 20 g n m3 the reactor volume and surface area were selected in order to meet this target at 30 and 20 c the volume was 7 5 m3 and the specific surface area was 200 m 1 for the scenarios at 10 c the volume was 20 m3 and the specific surface area 250 m 1 the inflow was set to 20 m3 d with an ammonium concentration of 100 g n m3 and 0 g m3 for no2 n no3 n and cod respectively the ph was assumed to remain constant in both axial and longitudinal directions the cod required for the heterotrophic growth was exclusively provided by biomass decay the influent composition was selected to represent a two stage reactor configuration that employed carbon removal as first stage providing the effluent for the deammonification system in the second stage similar to xu et al 2015 2 2 scenarios for the conceptual analysis of the multi compartment model different configurations and scenarios were studied the variables and values for these scenarios were as follows lfmax 0 2 0 5 and 1 mm gin varied between 0 and 50 m3 d temperature 10 20 and 30 c 2 3 temperature dependency the temperature dependency of the growth decay and hydrolysis rates was modeled with an arrhenius expression with θ being the temperature coefficient several studies have shown that anaob growth has different θ values within the temperature range of this study lotti et al 2015b therefore at 30 and 20 c θ took the value of 0 096 as reported in hao et al 2002a and for the simulations run at 10 c θ took the value of 0 14 the later θ value was calculated from the activation energy reported in lotti et al 2015b the temperature dependency for the diffusivity coefficients was modeled as suggested in perry 1997 supplementary material contains the values for the mass transfer coefficients used in the model 2 4 model configurations five configurations were investigated and they are shown in fig 1 configuration number 1 corresponded to the traditional modeling approach with one single compartment for biofilm reactor and membrane lumen the multi compartment model was implemented through the division of both biofilm reactor and membrane lumen into n number of compartments in this study n took values of 3 and 5 that were connected by advective links the multi compartment model used a recirculation qr when the simulation of an ideally mixed reactor cstr was required the recirculation was introduced through the artificial diffusion approach reported in baeten et al 2017 in their work the authors suggest that for a better representation of completely mixed systems in aquasim the different reactors should be connected through diffusive links instead of adjective links by doing so numerical problems regarding the mass balance are avoided the multi compartment model allowed the simulation of several configurations by deliberately inducing longitudinal substrate gradients in the biofilm reactor and longitudinal oxygen gradients in the membrane lumen table 1 and fig 1 summarize the configurations that were modeled 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimal airflow the airflow is one of the key operating parameters of mabrs thus finding the optimal airflow for the desired biological processes and effluent quality was the first exercise all the configurations table 1 had their optimal airflow rate at gin 5 m3 d this optimum corresponded to the minimal achievable tdn under the specific conditions for the respective configuration and also to the theoretical optimal ratio of oxygen flux to nh4 n load jo2 lnh4 n of 1 75 g o2 g n reported in terada et al 2007 as can be seen in figure s 1 of the supplementary information the scenario at 30 c with lfmax 0 5 mm was chosen as main example to underline our findings because it clearly illustrates the differences between configurations and the existence of an optimum gin fig 2 illustrates the dependency between tdn and the ratio jo2 lnh4 n for the example scenario fig 2 shows a clear optimum for all the configurations except of configuration 4 in that configuration the axial and longitudinal concentrations of oxygen and substrate in the biofilm did not match the optimal growth requirements of any species of the desired microbial community the locations where oxygen was present nh4 n was not and vice versa this resulted in insufficient biomass activity which led to an inadequate performance of the reactor such disadvantages of using counter current configurations have also been observed in other studies perez calleja et al 2017 this configuration was thus of no further interest due to its restricted nitrogen removal 3 2 optimal biofilm thickness a comprehensive analysis was conducted for all the configurations using the optimal gin described in the previous section fig 3 shows the performance for each configuration at each studied temperature and lf max it has been demonstrated already experimentally that the performance of an mabr system largely depends on the biofilm thickness ahmadi motlagh et al 2006 martin and nerenberg 2012 matsumoto et al 2007 a thicker biofilm promotes the substrate flux from the liquid however due to the counter diffusion of both substrates in case of this study nh4 n and oxygen there is a maximum biofilm thickness above which the nh4 n flux stops increasing because oxygen becomes limiting and inactive layers appear semmens and essila 2001 terada et al 2007 in addition the mass transfer resistances increment with the biofilm thickness so from the transport point of view an optimal biofilm thickness is also expected casey et al 2000a b fig 3 a gives an example on how a further increase in the biofilm thickness does not necessarily improve the performance of the reactor i e a lower tdn can be reached this scenario at 30 c revealed that the optimal biofilm thickness was 0 5 mm for all configurations and both thinner and thicker biofilms exhibited higher tdn concentrations in the effluent however decreasing the temperature from 30 c where the optimum biofilm thickness was 0 5 mm showed that at 20 and 10 c the optimum shifted to 1 0 mm fig 3 the activity of all the microbial species decreases with the temperature hao et al 2002b this decrease in activity also means a slower substrate consumption and that more biomass is required to treat the same substrate load as consequence at lower temperatures an mabr requires a thicker biofilm to reach the performance of a reactor operating at higher temperatures as reflected by the results of this study at temperatures of 10 and 20 c the configurations that had a biofilm thickness of 0 2 mm showed a poor performance the studied systems required a minimal biofilm thickness which then comprised the required autotrophic microbial community in the case of autotrophic nitrogen removal it is of vital importance that the microbial community includes anaob figure s 2 revealed how at 30 c the autotrophic microbial community was present whereas at 20 and 10 c the biofilm consisted mainly of aob and therefore almost no overall nitrogen removal was observed at 10 c even the thickest biofilm 0 5 mm had a poor performance it reached tdn effluent concentrations of 60 mg l experimental results from lotti et al 2015b showed that temperatures lower than 15 c have a stronger effect on anaob than on the other members of the microbial community thus when the temperature drops below 15 c significantly thicker biofilms are required to sustain a microbial community capable of performing complete autotrophic nitrogen removal that is biofilm that contains sufficient anaob the majority of the anaob was located in the outer layer of the biofilm where the oxygen concentration is nearly zero thinner biofilms reduce in consequence the amount of anaob within the biofilm and lead to less efficient nitrogen removal figure s 3 shows the axial distribution of the biomass where anaob were located in the more external part of the biofilm for configuration 5 table 1 the number of the compartments n did not greatly influence the tdn predictions independently of the biofilm thickness on the other hand in configurations 2 and 3 the number of compartments n did have a significant effect on the performance of the mabr more compartments resulted in a higher oxygen flux in the first part of the reactor see section 3 3 and thus depending on the specific configuration conditions a different tdn concentration was obtained for the same temperature all the model configurations predicted the same optimal biofilm thickness as the traditional model configuration 1 yet configuration 1 predicted a lower tdn concentration than the configurations with a longitudinal oxygen gradient configurations 2 and 3 it however predicted nearly the same tdn concentration than configuration 5 the results discussed in this section are a first indication that neglecting longitudinal gradients may lead to underestimation of effluent tdn levels additionally similar predictions between the traditional 1d model and the configuration 5 only substrate gradient in combination with the negligible influence of the number of compartments n for this configuration suggest that the longitudinal oxygen gradient affects the tdn more than the longitudinal substrate gradient 3 3 substrate and oxygen gradients for highlighting the differences between the multi compartment model and the traditional modeling approach the scenario at 30 c with lfmax 0 5 mm was also selected in this section fig 4 presents the longitudinal gradients for jo2 and the concentrations of all nitrogen species nh4 n no2 n no3 n for the selected example scenario with the optimal airflow gin 5 m3 d fig 4 a shows the longitudinal oxygen gradients for all the configurations and both values of n despite the evident differences in the substrate gradients fig 4 c to 4 h configurations 2 and 3 did have nearly identical longitudinal oxygen gradients fig 4 a shows the similarities for n 3 and fig 4 b for n 5 respectively in contrast the use of more compartments resulted in steeper longitudinal oxygen gradients the differences between the number of compartments can be seen in fig 4 a and 4 b jo2 was higher in the first compartment and lower in the last compartments for n 5 fig 4 b than in the case with n 3 fig 4 a the steepness of the longitudinal oxygen gradient is important for a better representation of potential reactor configurations as demonstrated by the experiments conducted by shanahan and semmens 2006 the authors showed that steeper or flatter jo2 gradients could occur experimentally depending on the flow velocity of the bulk phase and the development stage of the biofilm other experiments have also shown that longitudinal profiles of jo2 take place when dead end configurations are used on the membrane side pankhania et al 1999 fig 4 b fig 4 c and fig 4 d go into detail and illustrate the longitudinal nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentration gradients and the influence of the number of compartments n for configuration 2 only longitudinal oxygen gradient n had no significant influence on the nh4 n concentration it remained the same for both values of n however a steeper oxygen gradient resulted in lower no2 n concentrations and conversely higher no3 n concentrations the higher jo2 in the first compartment for the scenarios with n 5 led to the emergence of nob as confirmed afterwards in fig 6 hence more no2 n was converted into no3 n than into dinitrogen gas configuration 3 including both substrate and oxygen gradients exhibited a continuous decline of nh4 n and no2 n along the length for the simulations with n 5 the values of those species in the effluent were lower than in simulations with n 3 the steeper oxygen gradient combined with the right availability of substrates were responsible for the improved performance almost fully anoxic zones appeared at the end of the reactor fostering the growth of anaob as shown in fig 6 in configuration 3 no3 n increased accordingly with the length and was slightly higher for n 5 than for n 3 due to its production by anaob in configuration 5 only substrate gradient n did not have an important influence on the nitrogen species for both values of n nh4 n oxidized continuously along the length no significant no2 n accumulation was observed and no3 n increased along the reactor as a result of the anammox reaction this confirms once again the weak effect of the substrate gradient on the tdn the number of compartments n was expected to be an indicator of the steepness of the gradients in the case of the oxygen gradient more compartments resulted in a steeper gradient on the contrary the use of more compartments did not clearly change the steepness for the substrate gradients configurations with a substrate gradient 3 and 5 presented differences in the magnitude of the concentrations of nitrogen species for n 3 and n 5 however these differences were rather a consequence of the difference in jo2 than an effect of the number of compartments the results of the present study indicate that the oxygen gradient may subordinate the substrate gradient similarly other models have predicted a strong dependence of the nitrogen species fluxes with the oxygen concentration flux downing and nerenberg 2008 other studies focusing on cod removal showed how the presence of longitudinal oxygen gradients dead end mabr negatively affect the cod flux the biofilm formation and thus the reactor performance perez calleja et al 2017 although our findings cannot be directly compared with those results a tendency is recognized oxygen concentration flux give shape to the microbial community and therefore the substrate tends to follow the oxygen concentrations depending on the specific conditions of the systems 3 4 biomass stratification fig 5 revealed that when considering the reactor as one unit the overall biomass distribution was comparable for all the configurations the multi compartment model predicted larger amounts of anaob biomass and less inert matter in comparison to the traditional model the number of compartments n did not show a relevant influence on the overall biomass composition the majority of related work has focused on the stratification of biomass over the biofilm depth liu et al 2016 ma et al 2017 terada et al 2007 longitudinal stratification has only been identified and observed in rather few studies gilmore et al 2013 pankhania et al 1999 röske et al 1998 shanahan and semmens 2006 the traditional modeling approach neglects such stratifications whereas the proposed multi compartment model allows its prediction fig 6 shows the predicted biomass stratification along the length of the reactor for the example scenario configurations with longitudinal oxygen gradients 2 and 3 had a similar longitudinal distribution of biomass despite the differences in the substrate gradient as shown in fig 6 a to 6 d for configuration 5 fig 6 e and 6 f the biofilm composition was nearly the same in all the compartments additionally its composition was similar to the one of configuration 1 fig 5 this suggests that the longitudinal oxygen gradient is the main driving force for biofilm composition in configurations 2 and 3 fig 6 a to 6 d the longitudinal oxygen gradients created a clear longitudinal stratification of the biomass aob appeared only in the first compartment whereas anaob appeared almost exclusively in the last compartments the first compartment had a high jo2 in turn the jo2 in the last compartments was close to zero and therefore such stratifications occurred despite the fact that configurations 2 and 3 presented the same jo2 in the first compartment fig 4 a and 4 b the biomass composition of the first compartment was different for both configurations as shown in fig 6 particularly for n 3 configuration 2 fig 6 a did not hold anaob while they did appear in configuration 3 fig 6 c likewise for n 5 configuration 2 had nob fig 6 b whereas in configuration 3 nob did not appear fig 6 d fig 7 provides a closer examination of the oxygen gradients of the first compartment in the axial direction which exhibited significant differences the oxygen penetration depth varied depending on the configuration fig 7 in configuration 2 oxygen penetrated the biofilm deeper than in configuration 3 as a result the oxygen concentration in configuration 2 never reached a value lower than 0 01 mg o2 l but for configuration 3 it tended to zero from 0 06 mm onwards the model included an oxygen inhibition term for anaob according to the experimental evidence reported in strous et al 1997 the model used an inhibition constant of 0 01 mg l therefore no anaob occurred in the first compartment of configuration 2 in contrast to configuration 3 where anaob already appeared in the first compartment the axial oxygen gradient also explains the observed differences regarding nob oxygen concentrations at the biofilm base were higher in configuration 2 than in configuration 3 2 8 vs 1 7 mg o2 l this study used an oxygen affinity constant for nob equal to 2 2 mg o2 l which caused the appearance of nob in configuration 2 but not in configuration 3 neither configuration 1 nor configuration 5 exhibited nob within the biofilm and had similarly low values of oxygen at the biofilm base 0 44 and 0 35 mg o2 l respectively these results agree with experimental studies that demonstrated the dependency of nob abundance on oxygen concentration at the biofilm base values larger than 2 mg o2 l proved to benefit nob downing and nerenberg 2008 pellicer nàcher et al 2014 according to the results of this study the longitudinal oxygen gradient is the main driving force for both the longitudinal and axial distribution of the biomass nevertheless the substrate gradients slightly affected the axial gradients of oxygen and thus had an indirect influence on the biomass distribution the inclusion of longitudinal gradients in the model may thus be a better representation of the system and can help finding better strategies for targeted suppression or fostering of bacterial groups within the microbial community 4 conclusion the results delivered by the traditional mabr model for complete autotrophic nitrogen removal differ greatly from the results obtained with the multi compartment model the traditional model predicted lower effluent tdn concentrations than the new model the simulations indicated that longitudinal gradients of both oxygen and substrate significantly affected the global modeling results both gradients simultaneously influenced nitrogen removal whereas the oxygen gradient considerably affected the composition and distribution of the microbial community our multi compartment model predicted oxygen gradients along the biofilm depth that differed greatly from the ones obtained when using the traditional modeling approach in this work we showed that the biomass stratification also differed between these two modeling approaches the implementation of more compartments in a multi compartment model resulted in a steeper oxygen gradient both tdn concentrations and the microbial community distribution changed depending on the selected number of compartments declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix a supplementary data the

18489,membrane aerated biofilm reactors are becoming more important for nitrogen removal in the wastewater sector one dimensional 1d models are widely used to study the performance of such systems however 1d models are not able to simulate the longitudinal gradients that exist in the reactor although there is experimental evidence that points to the existence of longitudinal gradients simple modeling approaches that consider these gradients are not yet developed this study proposes a novel multi compartment model that simulates the longitudinal substrate and oxygen gradients it assesses the effects of temperature biofilm thickness number of compartments and flow configuration liquid and gas phase on the modeling results additionally it compares the capabilities of a traditional 1d model with those of the novel multi compartment model our results show that a classical 1d model predicts a lower total dissolved nitrogen concentration tdn in the effluent in contrast to the predictions of the multi compartment model in the worst case scenario the tdn predicted by the traditional 1d model was three times lower than the prediction of the multi compartment model the results delivered by the models differ also in the axial gradients the traditional 1d model for example predicted an oxygen concentration at the membrane surface of 0 4 mg o2 l while the multi compartment model predicted a concentration of 2 9 mg o2 l finally the results of this study show that the longitudinal oxygen gradient has an important effect on both biomass distribution and effluent tdn whereas the longitudinal substrate exclusively affected the effluent tdn graphical abstract image 1 keywords membrane aerated biofilm reactor biofilm nitrogen removal oxygen gradient substrate gradient multi compartment model 1 introduction current research is moving towards the implementation of deammonification processes in the mainstream one of the main goals is to develop strategies to overcome frequently encountered operational challenges such as low temperatures around 10 c relatively low nh4 concentrations biomass retention and high c n ratios xu et al 2015 one of the most widespread strategies to deal with those problems is a two stage configuration in the first stage cod is removed until an adequate c n ratio is achieved the effluent produced in this first stage is further treated in a subsequent stage through autotrophic deammonification han et al 2016 xu et al 2015 several processes have been tested for the second stage gilbert et al 2015 hu et al 2013 lotti et al 2015a wang et al 2016 among them also membrane aerated biofilm reactors mabrs and hybrid mabrs seem to be promising technologies peeters et al 2016 therefore mabrs lately regained significance in wastewater treatment in contrast to traditional biofilm reactors which use a co diffusion geometry i e both electron donor and acceptor are supplied via the liquid phase mabrs use a counter diffusion geometry i e the electron acceptor is supplied through the membrane via the gas phase whereas the electron donor is supplied through the liquid phase casey et al 1999 in the case of nitrogen removal from wastewater the diffusion of oxygen and substrates from different sides of the biofilm membrane and bulk liquid respectively creates a uniquely stratified biofilm that is capable of achieving several processes simultaneously e g nitrification and denitrification or partial nitrification and anammox the supply of oxygen from the biofilm base presents several advantages easier oxygen control ni et al 2013 and less n2o emissions kinh et al 2017 being two examples in addition the resistance of the diffusion layer affects the overall mass transfer less in comparison to the co diffusion geometry nerenberg 2016 modeling has proven to be a powerful tool for studying mabrs several research groups have already evaluated the influence of different factors on the performance of mabrs and their microbial communities these studies mainly focused on the axial gradients perpendicular to the membrane surface the optimization of aeration patterns and the behavior of the different geometries co and counter diffusion lackner and smets 2012 liu et al 2016 ni et al 2013 shanahan and semmens 2004 terada et al 2007 conceptual studies on mabrs use multispecies one dimensional models 1d to analyze the reactor performance under the conditions of interest although these models predict the axial characteristics of the biofilm and the axial profiles within it they do not include the ones occurring longitudinally along the length of the reactor resp the membrane there is experimental evidence that oxygen and substrate concentrations change not only in the axial direction but also in the longitudinal direction it has been reported that depending on reactor presence or absence of recirculation and membrane configuration dead end flow through longitudinal substrate and oxygen profiles may appear hibiya et al 2003 martin and nerenberg 2012 pankhania et al 1999 shanahan and semmens 2006 the limitations of the traditional 1d models together with the experimental evidence confirming the occurrence of longitudinal substrate and oxygen gradients disclose an important knowledge gap the impact of longitudinal gradients on the reactor performance remains to our knowledge largely unexplored moreover a simple method to introduce longitudinal gradients into conventional models is still missing this study developed a multi compartment model for completely autotrophic nitrogen removal in aquasim 2 1 reichert 1998 it introduced longitudinal substrate and oxygen gradients allowing the analysis of biofilm characteristics along the length of the reactor as well the model simulated the longitudinal gradients by combining multiple single 1d models with the assumption that mass transfer is perpendicular between membrane and biofilm iwa 2006 in order to compare a 1d model with our multi compartment model different scenarios were proposed temperature airflow gin maximum biofilm thickness lfmax and the number of compartments n took different values in the proposed scenarios additionally several flow configurations counter and co current flow were evaluated to assess the influence of the direction of flow the relative effect of the single inclusion of longitudinal gradients of either oxygen or substrates was also analyzed 2 methodology a mabr for completely autotrophic nitrogen removal was modeled in aquasim 2 1 reichert 1998 a novel multi compartment model was developed to evaluate the effect of longitudinal gradients for substrates and oxygen such gradients were implemented through the division of the biofilm reactor and the membrane lumen in several compartments the total dissolved nitrogen concentration tdn in the effluent and the biomass distribution obtained from the multi compartment model and the traditional 1d models were compared and evaluated 2 1 model set up a multi species model including ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria anaob and heterotroph

were represented as ideally mixed reactors a diffusive link at the biofilm base connected both compartments the oxygen flux jo2 represented by the diffusive link was calculated according to eqn 2 as proposed in casey et al 2000b 2 j o 2 k t o t s o 2 m h s o 2 b f where ktot is the total mass transfer coefficient for oxygen so2m and so2bf are the oxygen concentrations at the membrane and biofilm interface respectively the target tdn in the effluent was set to 20 g n m3 the reactor volume and surface area were selected in order to meet this target at 30 and 20 c the volume was 7 5 m3 and the specific surface area was 200 m 1 for the scenarios at 10 c the volume was 20 m3 and the specific surface area 250 m 1 the inflow was set to 20 m3 d with an ammonium concentration of 100 g n m3 and 0

biomass decay the influent composition was selected to represent a two stage reactor configuration that employed carbon removal as first stage providing the effluent for the deammonification system in the second stage similar to xu et al 2015 2 2 scenarios for the conceptual analysis of the multi compartment model different configurations and scenarios were studied the variables and values for

hydrolysis rates was modeled with an arrhenius expression with θ being the temperature coefficient several studies have shown that anaob growth has different θ values within the temperature range of

of mabrs thus finding the optimal airflow for the desired biological processes and effluent quality was the first exercise all the configurations table 1 had their optimal airflow rate at gin 5 m3 d this optimum corresponded to the minimal achievable tdn under the specific conditions for the respective configuration and also to the theoretical optimal ratio of oxygen flux to nh4 n load jo2 lnh4 n of 1 75 g o2 g n reported in terada et al 2007 as can be seen in figure s 1 of the supplementary information the scenario at 30 c with lfmax 0 5 mm was chosen as main example to underline our findings because it clearly illustrates the differences between configurations and the existence of an optimum gin fig 2 illustrates the dependency between tdn and the ratio jo2 lnh4 n for the example scenario fig 2 shows a clear optimum for all the configurations except of configuration 4 in that configuration the axial and longitudinal concentrations of oxygen and substrate in the biofilm did not match the optimal growth requirements of any species of the desired microbial community the locations where oxygen was present nh4 n was not and vice versa this resulted in insufficient biomass activity which led to an inadequate performance of the reactor such disadvantages of using counter current configurations have also been observed in other studies perez calleja et al 2017 this configuration was thus of no further interest due to its restricted nitrogen removal 3 2 optimal biofilm thickness a comprehensive analysis was conducted for all the configurations using the optimal gin described in the previous section fig 3 shows the performance for each configuration at each studied temperature and lf max it has been demonstrated already experimentally that the performance of an mabr system largely depends on the biofilm thickness ahmadi motlagh et al 2006 martin and nerenberg 2012 matsumoto et al 2007 a thicker biofilm promotes the substrate flux from the liquid however due to the counter diffusion of both substrates in case of this study nh4 n and oxygen there is a maximum biofilm thickness above which the nh4 n flux stops increasing because oxygen becomes limiting and inactive layers appear semmens and essila 2001 terada et al 2007 in addition the mass transfer resistances increment with the biofilm thickness so from the transport point of view an optimal biofilm thickness is also expected casey et al 2000a b fig 3 a gives an example on how a further increase in the biofilm thickness does not necessarily improve the performance of the reactor i e a lower tdn can be reached this scenario at 30 c revealed that the optimal biofilm thickness was 0 5 mm for all configurations and both thinner and thicker biofilms exhibited higher tdn concentrations in the effluent however decreasing the temperature from 30 c where the optimum biofilm thickness was 0 5 mm showed that at 20 and 10 c the optimum shifted to 1 0 mm fig 3 the activity of all the microbial species decreases with the temperature hao et al 2002b this decrease in activity also means a slower substrate consumption and that more biomass is required to treat the same substrate load as consequence at lower temperatures an mabr requires a thicker biofilm to reach the performance of a reactor operating at higher temperatures as reflected by the results of this study at temperatures of 10 and 20 c the configurations that had a biofilm thickness of 0 2 mm showed a poor performance the studied systems required a minimal biofilm thickness which then comprised the required autotrophic microbial community in the case of autotrophic nitrogen removal it is of vital importance that the microbial community includes anaob figure s 2 revealed how at 30 c the autotrophic microbial community was present whereas at 20 and 10 c the biofilm consisted mainly of aob and therefore almost no overall nitrogen removal was observed at 10 c even the thickest biofilm 0 5 mm had a poor performance it reached tdn effluent concentrations of 60 mg l experimental results from lotti et al 2015b showed that temperatures lower than 15 c have a stronger effect on anaob than on the other members of the microbial community thus when the temperature drops below 15 c significantly thicker biofilms are required to sustain a microbial community capable of performing complete autotrophic nitrogen removal that is biofilm that contains sufficient anaob the majority of the anaob was located in the outer layer of the biofilm where the oxygen concentration is nearly zero thinner biofilms reduce in consequence the amount of anaob within the biofilm and lead to less efficient nitrogen removal figure s 3 shows the axial distribution of the biomass where anaob were located in the more external part of the biofilm for configuration 5 table 1 the number of the compartments n did not greatly influence the tdn predictions independently of the biofilm thickness on the other hand in configurations 2 and 3 the number of compartments n did have a significant effect on the performance of the mabr more compartments resulted in a higher oxygen flux in the first part of the reactor see section 3 3 and thus depending on the specific configuration conditions a different tdn concentration was obtained for the same temperature all the model configurations predicted the same optimal biofilm thickness as the traditional model configuration 1 yet configuration 1 predicted a lower tdn concentration than the configurations with a longitudinal oxygen gradient configurations 2 and 3 it however predicted nearly the same tdn concentration than configuration 5 the results discussed in this section are a first indication that neglecting longitudinal gradients may lead to underestimation of effluent tdn levels additionally similar predictions between the traditional 1d model and the configuration 5 only substrate gradient in combination with the negligible influence of the number of compartments n for this configuration suggest that the longitudinal oxygen gradient affects the tdn more than the longitudinal substrate gradient 3 3 substrate and oxygen gradients for highlighting

for all the configurations and both values of n despite the evident differences in the substrate gradients fig 4 c to 4 h configurations 2 and 3 did have nearly identical longitudinal oxygen gradients fig 4 a shows the similarities for n 3 and fig 4 b for n 5 respectively in contrast the use of more compartments resulted in steeper longitudinal oxygen gradients the differences between the number of compartments can be seen in fig 4 a and 4 b jo2 was higher in the first compartment and lower in the last compartments for n 5 fig 4 b than in the case with n 3 fig 4 a the steepness of the longitudinal oxygen gradient is important for a better representation of potential reactor configurations as demonstrated by the experiments conducted by shanahan and semmens 2006 the authors showed that steeper or flatter jo2 gradients could occur experimentally depending on the flow velocity of the bulk phase and the development stage of the biofilm other experiments have also shown that longitudinal profiles of jo2 take place when dead end configurations are used on the membrane side pankhania et al 1999 fig 4 b fig 4 c and fig 4 d go into detail and illustrate the longitudinal nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentration gradients and the influence of the number of compartments n for configuration 2 only longitudinal oxygen gradient n had no significant influence on the nh4 n concentration it remained the same for both values of n however a steeper oxygen gradient resulted in lower no2 n concentrations and conversely higher no3 n concentrations the higher jo2 in the first compartment for the scenarios with n 5 led to the emergence of nob as confirmed afterwards in fig 6 hence more no2 n was converted into no3 n than into dinitrogen gas configuration 3 including both substrate and oxygen gradients exhibited a continuous decline of nh4 n and no2 n along the length for the simulations with n 5 the values of those species in the effluent were lower than in simulations with n 3 the steeper oxygen gradient combined with the right availability of substrates were responsible for the improved performance almost fully anoxic zones appeared at the end of the reactor fostering the growth of anaob as shown in fig 6 in configuration 3 no3 n increased accordingly with the length and was slightly higher for n 5 than for n 3 due to its production by anaob in configuration 5 only substrate gradient n did not have an important influence on the nitrogen species for both values of n nh4 n oxidized continuously along the length no significant no2 n accumulation was observed and no3 n increased along the reactor as a result of the anammox reaction this confirms once again the weak effect of the substrate gradient on the tdn the number of compartments n was expected to be an indicator of the steepness of the gradients in the case of the oxygen gradient more compartments resulted in a steeper gradient on the contrary the use of more compartments did not clearly change the steepness for the substrate gradients configurations with a substrate gradient 3 and 5 presented differences in the magnitude of the concentrations of nitrogen species for n 3 and n 5 however these differences were rather a consequence of the difference in jo2 than an effect of the number of compartments the results of the present study indicate that the oxygen gradient may subordinate the substrate gradient similarly other models have predicted a strong dependence of the nitrogen species fluxes with the oxygen concentration flux downing and nerenberg 2008 other studies focusing on cod removal showed how the presence of longitudinal oxygen gradients dead end mabr negatively affect the cod flux the biofilm formation and thus the reactor performance perez calleja et al 2017 although our findings cannot be directly compared with those results a tendency is recognized oxygen concentration flux give shape to the microbial community and therefore the substrate tends to follow the oxygen concentrations depending on the specific conditions of the systems 3 4 biomass stratification fig 5 revealed that when considering the reactor as one unit the overall biomass distribution was comparable for all the configurations the multi compartment model predicted larger amounts of anaob biomass and less inert matter in comparison to the traditional model the number of compartments n did not show a relevant influence on the overall biomass composition the majority of related work has focused on the stratification of biomass over the biofilm depth liu et al 2016 ma et al 2017 terada et al 2007 longitudinal stratification has only been identified and observed in rather few studies gilmore et al 2013 pankhania et al 1999 röske et al 1998 shanahan and semmens 2006 the traditional modeling approach neglects such stratifications whereas the proposed multi compartment model allows its prediction fig 6 shows the predicted biomass stratification along the length of the reactor for the example scenario configurations with longitudinal oxygen gradients 2 and 3 had a similar longitudinal distribution of biomass despite the differences in the substrate gradient as shown in fig 6 a to 6 d for configuration 5 fig 6 e and 6 f the biofilm composition was nearly the same in all the compartments additionally its composition was similar to the one of configuration 1 fig 5 this suggests that the longitudinal oxygen gradient is the main driving force for biofilm composition in configurations 2 and 3 fig 6 a to 6 d the longitudinal oxygen gradients created a clear longitudinal stratification of the biomass aob appeared only in the first compartment whereas anaob appeared almost exclusively in the last compartments the first compartment had a high jo2 in turn the jo2 in the last compartments was close to zero and therefore such stratifications occurred despite the fact that configurations 2 and 3 presented the same jo2 in the first compartment fig 4 a and 4 b the biomass composition of the first compartment was different for both configurations as shown in fig 6 particularly for n 3 configuration 2 fig 6 a did not hold anaob while they did appear in configuration 3 fig 6 c likewise for n 5 configuration 2 had nob fig 6 b whereas in configuration 3 nob did not appear fig 6 d fig 7 provides a closer examination of the oxygen gradients of the first compartment in the axial direction which exhibited significant differences the oxygen penetration depth varied depending on the configuration fig 7 in configuration 2 oxygen penetrated the biofilm deeper than in configuration 3 as a result the oxygen concentration in configuration 2 never reached a value lower than 0 01 mg o2 l but for configuration 3 it tended to zero from 0 06 mm onwards the model included an oxygen inhibition term for anaob according to the experimental evidence reported in strous et al 1997 the model used an inhibition constant of 0 01 mg l therefore no anaob occurred in the first compartment of configuration 2 in contrast to configuration 3 where anaob already appeared in the first compartment the axial oxygen gradient also explains the observed differences regarding nob oxygen concentrations at the biofilm base were higher in configuration 2 than in configuration 3 2 8 vs 1 7 mg o2 l this study used an oxygen affinity constant for nob equal to 2 2 mg o2 l which caused the appearance of nob in configuration 2 but not in configuration 3 neither configuration 1 nor configuration 5 exhibited nob within the biofilm and had similarly low values of oxygen at the biofilm base 0 44 and 0 35 mg o2 l respectively these results agree with experimental studies that demonstrated the dependency of nob abundance on oxygen concentration at the biofilm base values larger than 2 mg o2 l proved to benefit nob downing and nerenberg 2008 pellicer nàcher et al 2014 according to the results of this study the longitudinal oxygen gradient is the main driving force for both the longitudinal and axial distribution of the biomass nevertheless the substrate gradients slightly affected the axial gradients of oxygen and thus had an indirect influence on the biomass distribution the inclusion of longitudinal gradients in the model may thus be a better representation of the system and can help finding better strategies for targeted suppression or fostering of bacterial groups within the microbial community 4 conclusion the results delivered by the traditional mabr model for complete autotrophic nitrogen removal differ greatly from the results obtained with the multi compartment model the traditional model predicted lower effluent tdn concentrations than the new model the simulations indicated that longitudinal gradients of both oxygen and substrate significantly affected the global modeling results both gradients simultaneously influenced nitrogen removal whereas the oxygen gradient considerably affected the composition and distribution of the microbial community our multi compartment model predicted oxygen gradients along the biofilm depth that differed greatly from the ones obtained when using the traditional modeling approach in this work we showed that the biomass stratification also differed between these two modeling approaches the implementation of more compartments in a multi compartment model resulted in a steeper oxygen gradient both tdn concentrations and the microbial community distribution changed depending on the selected number of compartments declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix a supplementary data the
