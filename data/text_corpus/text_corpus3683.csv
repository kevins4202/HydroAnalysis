18415,within all aquatic environments aside from the physical dispersal of dissolved and or particulate phase contaminants alteration from both biological and chemical processes are shown to change the chemistry of the parent compounds often these alterations can lead to secondary influences because of cooperative microbial processes i e coupled respiratory pathways and or energy and biodegradation cycles complicating our understanding of the biological impact that these mobile compounds impose on ecosystem health the mcmurray formation mf the formation constituting the minable bituminous oil sands is a natural ongoing source of hydrocarbon bound sediments to river ecosystems in the region via terrestrial and aquatic erosion providing a natural mesocosm to track and characterize the effects of these compounds on regional aquatic primary productivity here we characterize the natural in situ microbial response to increasing hydrocarbon exposure along a river continuum in the downstream direction using the steepbank river stb suspended and bed sediment samples were collected at 3 sites from upstream to downstream as the water flows into and through the mf samples were then analyzed for the active in situ gene expression of the microbial communities results from both suspended and bed sediments show clear and significant shifts in the microbial metabolic processes within each respective compartment in response to the elevated polycyclic aromatic compound pac concentrations specific genes likely responsible for hydrocarbon breakdown alkane monooxygenase benzoyl coa reductase etc experience elevated expression levels while certain energy metabolism genes nitrogen sulfur methane reveal fundamental shifts in their pathway specificity indicating an adaptation response in their basic energy metabolism expression from suspended sediments reveal subtle yet delayed metabolic response further downstream compared to bed sediments indicative of the erosion and transport dynamics within a lotic system these results provide insight into the use of novel clusters of gene biomarkers to track the active in situ microbial response of both emerging and legacy contaminants such information will be important in determining the best management strategies for the monitoring and assessment of aquatic health in both natural and contaminated ecosystems graphical abstract image 1 keywords metatranscriptomics biomarkers hydrocarbons sediments suspended oil sands 1 introduction while water quality and ecological changes within the lower athabasca river lar are often perceived to be resultant from industrial oil sand deposit exploitation the differentiation of industrial versus natural contributions of pacs is a complex and yet unresolved issue additionally there has yet to be definitive studies identifying fundamental biogeochemical shifts attributed to this natural pac signature no proven fingerprinting method to achieve the above has been proven or accredited to date culp et al 2018 further culp et al 2018 have suggested that while there is significant data on particulate atmospheric deposition there is limited information birks et al 2017 or model that can project the proportion of surface wash off that enters a river course as such droppo et al 2018 suggests that most of the pacs that are transported within the rivers of the lar are derived from hillslope and channel erosion of the mcmurray formation mf the geologic formation that defines the minable oil sands deposit and not from direct or atmospheric anthropogenic inputs regardless of pac source a substantive knowledge gap in relation to how the microbial consortium 1 is influenced by the high hydrocarbon content of the sediments suspended and bed and 2 on how the microbes influence the contaminant speciation of the pacs both of these synonymous biochemical processes will inevitably alter the biogeochemical footprints with concomitant impacts on the natural ecology while most studies of contaminants and microbial impacts in rivers have been studied only on the bed sediment community structure e g biofilms yergeau et al 2012 few studies have characterized the dynamics of bitumen containing suspended sediment ss within rivers of the lar droppo et al 2018 did observe temporal and spatial trends in ss loads and pac signatures with distance downstream for the ells and steepbank stb rivers using passive ss samplers they however did not investigate any microbial influence relative to these spatial and temporal trends recent studies have begun to unravel the natural microbial structure within bed sediments in the region reid et al 2018 2019 yergeau et al 2012 though there remains a lack of understanding with respect to the true microbial function within the entire region including for both ss and bed sediments further there are to our knowledge no studies that provide potential gene biomarkers which reveal statistically differing expression patterns as a direct result to increasing hydrocarbon exposure of the mf tracking contaminants is clearly not a new area of research for years scientists have studied contaminant sites such as those of the exxon valdez oil spill and the deep water horizon disaster in most studies tracking contaminant distribution conventional geochemical testing in association with taxonomic surveys only provides researchers a glimpse into the effects these contaminants have on the natural ecology what has been missing is how the primary producers such as the diverse microbial communities found in all lakes rivers and streams deal with the stressors resulting from the exposure to various compounds shifts in the functional attributes of microbial communities are direct and primary biological responses that can induce ecosystem wide alteration what is too often the case is that contaminant sites are only studied after contamination has occurred leaving a knowledge gap as to the true baseline character of the ecosystem prior to xenobiotic exposure this study uses metatranscriptomics analyses to determine the efficiency of shotgun gene expression surveys for tracking the microbial response to increasing hydrocarbon exposure in ss and bed sediments through the river continuum of the steepbank river stb of the lar alberta canada a control location upstream of the natural hydrocarbon deposit mf provide our reference site within the same river continuum clearwater formation cf this research aims to provide 1 insight into the natural genetic response of microbes to increasing hydrocarbon exposure and 2 provide potential gene biomarkers that reveal statistically differing expression patterns as a direct result to increasing hydrocarbon exposure this has strong implications worldwide where gene expression surveys of aquatic microbial communities could be ideal tools in tracking contaminant exposure as an alternative or augmentation to conventional geochemical fingerprinting practices 2 methods 2 1 sampling site descriptions samples were collected on the steepbank river stb at three sites representing a gradient of pac concentrations from upstream to downstream fig 1 in october 2017 the middle to lower reaches of stb cuts through the mf the ore deposit constituting the athabasca oil sands the upstream site was located within the cf and as such contained marginal to no bitumen sample sites from upstream to downstream are therefore designated cf low mf med and mf high all samples are presumed to represent the natural pac characteristics of the stb given there are legislated no direct discharges from industrial properties if there were an input it can only be from atmospheric deposition which will be highly diluted by the volume of water in the rivers and the primary source of particle load being from the channel itself droppo et al 2018 the stb flows from the east with an elevation change from 625 to 320 m at the confluence with the athabasca river fig 1 mf is composed of minable bitumen rich deposits combined with fine to coarse grained sand interbedded with lesser amounts of silt and clay musial et al 2012 stb has a mean annual flow of 4 8 m3 s 1 and is considered a groundwater dominated river with an average of 50 of flow derived from groundwater gibson et al 2016 2 2 sediment collection sediments were collected from both the river beds and suspended particulates bed sediments consisting of the interface down to approximately 1 cm depth were collected in triplicate into sterile 5 ml cryotubes and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen in the field for nucleic acid extractions bulk sediments were collected into 500 ml hdpe nalgene bottles with no headspace and kept frozen until analysis suspended sediments were collected by a portable continuous flow centrifugation alfa laval model wsb 103b water was pumped 4 l min 1 to the centrifuge by a 5c md march submersible pump located in the middle of the river at mid depth recovery of ss was greater than 90 recovery outflow tss inflow tss sediment collected in the centrifuge bowl was immediately removed and placed in 5 ml cryotubes and flash frozen as above total pac data from each sampling location was obtained from the regional aquatics monitoring program ramp database ramp 2015 2 3 sem analysis bulk bed sediments were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy sem to understand particle distribution and evidence for hydrocarbon signatures specifically the environmental scanning electron microscope fei quanta200f eindhoven netherlands was used at the great lakes institute for environmental research glier university of windsor windsor on canada here analyses were performed at high vacuum 20 kv with a theoretical spot size of 2 6 nm grain inspections and size distributions were performed using both secondary electron se and backscattered electron bse detectors elemental composition analysis was performed with the edax sili detector edax mahwah new jersey usa 2 4 dna rna extractions library preparation total environmental dna extractions were performed according to manufacturer protocols in duplicate using the mobio powersoil total dna isolation kits now qiagen dneasy powersoil kit dna was amplified and purified according to reid et al 2016 to specifically explore the v5 v6 region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene briefly the v5 v6 region was amplified using dual polymerase chain reactions pcr followed by a second barcoding pcr to uniquely identify samples for pooling and sequencing on the ion torrent pgm platform life technologies carlsbad california at the great lakes institute for environmental research at the university of windsor windsor ontario canada pooled dna libraries were checked for quality assurances and concentration on the agilent 2100 bioanalyzer prior to sequencing total environmental rna extractions were performed using the mobio powersoil total rna isolation kits mobio laboratories carlsbad california per slightly modified protocols initial sediment quantity for extraction was bumped to 5 g to increase overall rna yield all reagents and samples were kept on ice throughout extraction to maintain rna integrity and minimize degradation throughout the extraction quality and concentrations were analyzed on the agilent 2100 bioanalyzer where concentrations exceeded 100 ng μl and quality scores exceeded rin of 7 5 samples of sufficient quality and concentration were sent in duplicate to genome quebec innovation center at mcgill university in montreal quebec canada there samples were again checked to ensure they met quality control standards and rrna depletion illumina ribo zero rrna removal kit bacterial and yeast was performed to enhance the mrna concentration samples were then sequenced on the illumina hiseq 4000 nextgen sequencer 2 5 16s rrna community structure analysis microbial taxonomy was analyzed to augment the metatranscriptomics functional dataset providing information as to which microbes were likely associated with observed gene expression raw sequence files were processed through the macqiime v 1 9 1 pipeline www qiime org an open source bioinformatics pipeline for 16s rrna amplicon sequences caporaso et al 2010 sequence files were filtered and sequences with a phred score below 20 were omitted sequences were then clustered into operational taxonomic units otus omitting singletons and doubletons at a similarity threshold of 97 using the uclust algorithm chimeras were removed using the usearch61 algorithm with macqiime taxonomy was assigned to representative otu sequences for each cluster using the default greengenes database at a 90 confidence threshold desantis et al 2006 relative abundances of reads per sample were calculated to gain an understanding of the dominant taxa between sample sites 2 6 metatranscriptomics data processing and differential expression analysis all raw metatranscriptomics sequence data was processed through the mg rast metagenomics rapid annotation using subsystem technology pipeline meyer et al 2008 this automated pipeline was designed for the analysis of high throughput sequencing datasets proving both functional and phylogenetic summaries raw paired end sequence files were submitted where pairing quality filtering and the annotation of functional genes was performed a phred quality score of 30 was applied to submitted raw sequence files transcripts were annotated to the ko kegg orthology database visualizations for gene expression correlations was then performed using the start app a web based rnaseq analysis and visualization resource nelson et al 2017 raw expression values were normalized to counts per million cpm using the limma package linear models for microarray and rna seq data of r bioconductor within the start application gene expression boxplots are expressed as logcpm values and p values are provided where statistical significance is noted mean variance modelling at the observation level voom was utilized for the logcpm determination expression heatmaps were created through heatmapper a free online server for the creation of heatmaps and other visualization tools babicki et al 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characteristics of suspended and bed sediments spatial trends of pac concentrations in the suspended and bed sediments of the stb were measured at the 3 sample sites supplementary table s1 pac concentrations indicate a generally increasing load of pac moving downstream from cl low upstream to mf high downstream overall there is a significant increase in total pac as exposure increases through the mf fig 2 with concentrations totaling 34 8 118 3 and 425 5 ng l at cf low mf med and mf high respectively these findings correlate with those of droppo et al 2018 who also observed increases in pac loadings in the ss moving through the formation in the stb the highest concentration pacs were alkylated compounds specifically c2 c3 c4 dibenzothiphenes c2 c3 c4 phenanthrenes anthracenes c2 fluoranthenes pyrenes and c4 napthalenes these alkyl homologs are indicative of the mf and have been used as indicators of the bitumen deposit in various other studies as they can reveal minute variations within the deposit droppo et al 2018 scanning electron microscopy also revealed similar trends of increasing hydrocarbon concentrations within the bed sediment fig 3 shows the interstitial hydrocarbon content of the bed sediments where increasing carbon content correlates to the observed bituminous compounds within the interstitial sediment grains raman spectroscopy specifically confirmed the bitumen content within mf high revealing peaks suggestive of raw bitumen results not presented the presence of bitumen in the interstitial pore spaces of several prepared sem slides portrays the truly ubiquitous presence of the pacs in the sediments of the mf additionally visual analysis on the sem appeared to show a decreasing trend in particle size distribution from cf low to mf high sediment particles appeared to be well sorted upstream of the mf though became more varied as exposure to the mf increased it is interesting to note that cf low does in fact contain some measurable pacs despite being outside of the mcmurray formation though no bitumen was observable under the sem however this could be attributed to natural pacs resulting from combustion of organics such as wood or grasses or perhaps some other anthropogenic influence e g atmospheric deposition this is especially relevant in this region where a large forest fire swept through a year earlier and would have inevitably introduced a pac signature to the natural landscape however this type of pac is indicative of pyrogenic origin and thus is chemically different than the pac signature of the mf droppo et al 2018 indicated that there was a correlation between wood grass coal burning and low flow events which may be what we are observing here nonetheless there was no visible evidence of bitumen derived from the mf within the sediments observed under the sem these chemical characterizations of increasing pac load within the ss and the associated microscopy results reveal considerable hydrocarbon content that is not only highly concentrated in the bed sediments but is readily eroded and transported through the water column and downstream these hydrocarbon signatures in both the water and sediment compartment provides an ideal opportunity to characterize how the microbial community is dealing with such a unique hydrodynamic sediment regime under varying pac exposures 3 2 microbial community structure functional dynamics 3 2 1 sequencing summaries and statistics the metataxonomic analysis consisted of a total of 12 single end sequence files averaging 88 995 raw sequences per sample clustering resulted in a total of 19 925 unique otus at a 97 similarity threshold the metatranscriptomics dataset also consisted of 12 paired end sequence files with over 39 million reads per sample averaging 46 549 109 sequences each with phred quality scores all 30 read annotation resulted in reads mapped to basic cellular processes genetic information processing and environmental information processing alongside extensive coverage of metabolic pathways indicative of energy metabolism of interest herein i e nitrogen sulfur methane cycling sequence files for both 16s rrna and metatranscriptomics are submitted to the ncbi sequence read archive sra under the project number prjna564313 3 2 2 microbial community structure 16s rrna gene amplicon metataxonomic analyses were performed to understand how the exposure of mf hydrocarbons may have altered the taxonomic distribution at each site figs 4 and 5 clearly illustrate a shift in the microbial structure between the ss and bed sediments most prominent is the dominance of proteobacteria in both the ss and bed sediments constituting approximately 61 59 and 66 of the community within the ss and only about 41 43 and 47 in the bed sediments of cf low mf med and mf high respectively in general ss is more abundant in actinobacteria cyanobacteria and proteobacteria compared to the bed at each respective site bed sediments showed similar trends in community structure as previous studies with more abundant acidobacteria bacteroidetes chlorobi chloroflexi firmicutes plantomycetes spirochaetes and verrumicrobia representing a diverse microbial assemblage capable of thriving in this unique environment yergeau et al 2012 acidobacteria though remaining poorly understood are a diverse range of organisms ubiquitous in soils and sediments naether et al 2012 of note is the family holophagaceae containing genera capable of aromatic compound degradation and geothrix and anaerobic chemoorganotroph generally utilizing fe iii as its electron acceptor bacteroidetes also comprise a diverse range of organisms and was second in abundance overall behind the proteobacteria one of the most dominant families of bacteroidetes was cytophagaceae within this family a novel genus dyadobacter is known to degrade xenobiotic compounds in aromatic hydrocarbon contaminated soils willumsen et al 2005 dyadobacter was most observed here to be most abundant in the ss at mf med though these were at relatively low abundances overall still the overall high abundance of cytophagaceae suggests that there may be other genera of similar metabolic capabilities responsible for degradation of similarly complex carbon compounds chlorobi contains organisms that are both anaerobic photoautotrophs alongside obligate heterotrophs and was also found in man made reservoirs in the region reid et al 2019 it s presence in the bed sediments indicates a response to sulfide production deeper within the sediments perhaps also acting as a detoxifier in its oxidation of sulfides chloroflexi are also anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria though some are also able to utilize halogenated compounds as electron acceptors in their respiratory process notable taxonomic families observed include anaerolinaceae and dehalococcoidaceae anaerolinaceae has been found to closely affiliate with methanogenic activity with the ability to activate the breakdown of long chain n alkanes liang et al 2016 dehalococcoidaceae is an organohalide respiring organism known to utilize h2 as its electron donor this is significant as it may suggest a means by which to reduce the build up of h2 because of methanogenic biodegradation processes allowing for these processes to proceed clostridium spp within the firmicutes phylum has been shown to also closely associate with methanogens and has been shown to be highly abundant in oil cultures and toluene degrading methanogenic cultures fowler et al 2016 however it was also noted that they may only be involved in the subsequent breakdown of hydrocarbons after initial activation has taken place fowler et al 2016 the remaining phyla observed plantomycetes spirochaetes and verrumicrobia all represent diverse groups of organisms many of which are commonly found in both soils and marine and freshwater environments worldwide it is interesting to note that there was an increased abundance of the proteobacteria and cyanobacteria within the ss within the cyanobacteria phylum particularly dominant was the family of nostocaceae known for its nitrogen fixation abilities reid et al 2019 also observed the presence of these organisms in deeper freshwater reservoirs suggesting that there is a significant phototrophic influence on the biogeochemistry of this region the presence of nostocaceae could be suggestive of a syntrophic cooperation with aquatic plants who would benefit from the production of ammonia additionally the production of ammonia could be utilized by other chemoheterotrophs in the breakdown of organics such as the pacs of the mf the increased abundance of cyanobacteria is expected in the ss where ample sunlight is present alongside ample nutrients derived from some of the breakdown processes within the water column or bed sediments the increased abundance of proteobacteria however was somewhat unexpected where betaproteobacteria were largely responsible for this increase betaproteobacteria was the most dominant class overall second only to the alphaproteobacteria fig 5 the prominence of these classes of organisms could be linked to their highly diverse metabolic abilities making them particularly efficient in adapting to the hydrocarbon gradient of the mf dworkin et al 2006 the betaproteobacteria family of comamonadaceae was most dominant in all the ss samples comamonadaceae is an extremely diverse family of organisms harboring genera capable of wide ranging phenotypic abilities noted abilities of comamonadaceae and other families of betaproteobacteria to degrade a variety of petroleum contaminants makes the presence of this organism extremely relevant in the context of this unique hydrocarbon gradient present within the stb mukherjee et al 2017 zedelius et al 2011 additionally betaproteobacteria contain organisms with the ability to oxidize ammonia stein and klotz 2016 part of the nitrification pathway potentially resulting from pac breakdown within the stb perhaps the greatest noted increase from cf low to mf med was in the abundance of spirobacillales an order of deltaproteobacteria spirobacillales is a known degrader of toxins produced by certain cyanobacteria lezcano et al 2017 providing a potentially interesting correlation to the depletion of cyanobacteria noted here also this may be evidence towards the notion of pac inhibition of photosynthetic activity as noted in other studies marwood et al 1999 however this heightened abundance could just be attributed to the increased abundance of complex organics which could also be utilized by spirobacillales lezcano et al 2017 moving downstream from the cf to mf there are clearly changes in the microbial community structure though subtle from upper taxonomic classifications aside from the betaproteobacteria principal coordinate analyses pcoa of all operational taxonomic units otus was implemented to better understand community structure variation between sample sites initially evident is a clear separation of ss from the bed sediments fig 6 coordinate 1 represents over 50 of the variation while coordinate 2 represents approximately 21 cf low ss and bed sediments appear to be the most unique of all the other sites and is the only site showing relatively similar ss and bed sediment communities this is likely attributed to its upstream situation above the mf where it has not yet been influenced by the significant hydrocarbon signature of mf the divergent nature of both the ss and bed sediments from the cf low control site indicates increasing differences in the community structure not only between sites but also within site ss and bed samples mf med ss and bed sediments are most divergent from the cf low sites perhaps representative of its sudden hydrocarbon signature moving into the mf it is interesting that mf high is taxonomically more closely related to cf low especially given its geographically the most distant sampling site and exhibits the highest pac signature overall however what this may be suggesting is that by mf high given enough exposure time within the mf the microbial community has adapted or equilibrated to the altered environmental stimuli of the mf the microbial community at mf med may be under a drastic state of flux or adaptation which is perhaps inducing rapid alteration to the dna signature resulting in the heightened variation at the otu level nonetheless this data suggests that the use of pcoa and similarity indices bray curtis in this case do reveal shifts in the community composition because of hydrocarbon exposure though not necessarily indicative of the stepwise increase of pacs observed down the river continuum 3 2 3 suspended sediment microbial function the microbial gene expression associated with the suspended sediment ss observed through the stb river continuum reveals significant shifts in the metabolic pathways in response to the incremental increases in pac content moving downstream from cf low through to mf high fig 7 these metabolic shifts were observed despite extremely low turbidity levels 5 ntu and cold water temperatures 10 c at the time of sampling in higher turbidity instances and warmer summer temperatures one could reasonably expect an even greater biotic signature to be ascertained through these metatranscriptomics approaches in the ss samples there is a significant suppression of several energy metabolism genes including nitrogen fixation nitrite reductase and assimilatory sulfate reductase additionally there is significant suppression of photosynthetic genes responsible for both the coloring of cyanobacteria cpcef genes for phycocyanobilin lyase logfc 2 06 p 0 05 and the photosystem i and ii systems psa and psb found in phototrophic organisms logfc 1 p 0 05 this suggests a fundamental shift in natural metabolic character of the microbes including the phototrophic communities residing within the water column this suppression of genes specific to cyanobacteria and their photosynthetic functions correlate to the decrease in cyanobacterial abundance noted within the 16s rrna amplicon data alongside other studies which revealed photosynthetic inhibition due to pac presence marwood et al 1999 however there is a significant increase in the expression of bchqr genes responsible for the photosynthetic function of green sulfur bacteria anoxygenic phototrophs relying on sulfides as an electron source this may indicate a shift towards a more sulfide rich system moving towards mf high dissimilatory sulfate reductase genes dsrab aprab and methanogenesis genes mcr and mtr showed relatively consistent expression within the ss through to mf high however methane oxidation transcripts mxaf methanol dehydrogenase show signficantly increasing expression logfc 0 774 p 0 05 moving downstream with some of the overall highest expression noted in the ss further the expression of amoab ammonia monooxygenase showed a gradual increase in expression moving downstream as well previously shown to be correlated to hydrocarbon exposure and metabolism dolan et al 2010 urakawa et al 2019 this too may correlate to the highly abundant betaproteobacteria some of which harbor these same genes for ammonia oxidation these iterative expression changes correlating to the stepwise increase in hydrocarbon content indicates that even the microbial community within the ss in the water column which likely has lower cellular density than in the bed is experiencing significant alteration to their upstream metabolic signature which is in fact measureable utilizing these shotgun rnaseq protocols the increased expression of methanotrophic genes i e methane oxidation indicate that perhaps the microbial population is adapting to the changes in hydrocarbon content whereby enhanced methanogenic activity from below see 3 2 4 is being at least partially offset by the methanotrophs in the overlying water further the fact that many of the significantly differentially expressed genes belong to the broader categories of environmental information processing and cellular processes indicates that the microbial communities travelling on or with the ss are experiencing dramatic changes in their core cellular functionality not just their energy metabolism alone aside from energy metabolism pathways dominant trends where also observed in the expression of known biodegradation genes within the ss there were significantly increasing trends from cf low through mf med to mf high of several known hydrocarbon degradation genes including but not imited to alkane monooxygenase alkb benzoyl coa reductase baddefg nitronate monooxygenase nmo and hydroxybenzoate monooxygenase poba logfc 0 15 p 0 05 there was also a spike in the expression of benzylsuccinate coa bbsb at both mf med and mf high compared to cf low logfc 2 though this was not significantly different p 0 268 the expression of alkb may correlate to the highly abundant alpha beta and gammaproteobacteria classes alongside actinobacteria who all contain closely related homolog genes for alkane degradation the magnitude of these fold changes are low though this is somewhat expected given that what we are observing are small communities of microbes in transit within the water column there is likely little in the way of redundancy in their functional abilities beyond necessary cell survival so even small changes observed here may be relatively drastic in terms of their overall functional characteristic the signficant increase in gene expressions noted here indicate that the microbial community suspended in the water column are directly responding to the hydrocarbon influence of the mf altering their natural energy metabolisms to adjust towards a seemingly increased biodegradation capacity within the mf this abundance and specificity of the significantly different transcripts within ss are potential targets from which to evaluate genes for the purpose of hydrocarbon compound tracking in other freshwater environments 3 2 4 bed sediment microbial function similar to the ss analyses bed sediment community functions shifted significantly in response to the mfs hydrocarbon influence the absolute magnitude of expressions from within the bed sediments was generally significantly higher than that of the ss aside from methanotrophy likely related to the increased cell density within the sediments the above is also evidenced in the magnitude of change exhibited by the genes mentioned previously here similar trends in the expression of specific energy metabolism pathways were observed though almost all indicate suppression dissimilatory and assimilatory nitrate reductase and assimilatory sulfate reductase both showed signs of suppression in both mf med and mf high within mf high however dissimilatory nitrate reductase expression was considerably higher than cf low this would suggest a shift in the general nitrogen metabolism moving into the mf noted by the increased dissimilatory nitrate reduction genes ammonium monooxygenase amoabc dissimilatory sulfate reductase dsrab and aprab and methanogenesis mcr and mtr genes saw sharp increases in expression at mf med followed by a slight decrease in the mf high location these coinsiding increases in dissimilatory processes may be evidence of energy conservation strategies in response to an overall shift towards biodegradation or perhaps a response to the increased nutrient availability associated with the pacs present the differential expression analyses between mf med and cf low shows several mtr and mcr subunits as the most highly overexpressed in mf med logfc 2 p 0 05 clearly a response to the increase pac exposure also observed in previous studies within the mf reid et al 2019 2018 known and identified biodegradation genes within bed sediments also exhibit a clear response to mf exposure here showing a generally increasing expression moving from clear water formation upstream to mcmurray formation downstream alkane monooxygenase alkb benzoyl coa reductase baddefg nitronate monooxygenase nmo and benzoylsuccinyl coa dehydrogenase bbsbd all show increasing expression moving downstream towards mf high specifically significant overexpression of alkb baddefg and bbsbd was observed between mf high and cf low logfc 1 p 0 05 these elevated expression levels further support a specific genetic response to increasing exposure to elevated hydrocarbon levels indicating their potential as pac biomarkers further downstream it is interesting to note that some of these biodegradation expression signatures appeared to be expressed earlier in the bed sediments than in the ss again possibly due to of the lag time needed for sediments to become suspended in the water column from surface washoff or channel erosion 3 2 5 identifying contaminant gradients and their impacts on microbial metabolic expression the breadth of data obtained through shotgun metatranscriptomics surveys is immense making it difficult to effectively efficiently and accurately correlate trends in gene expression patterns however by making observations of clusters of closely co expressing genes one can overcome variation potentially attributed to the expression of single genes in situ and make more robust inferences based on redundant genetic response by observing these metabolic signatures via expression heatmap fig 7 and computing average linkage clustering between certain genes it becomes evident that there are contrasting functional characteristics between ss and bed sediments alongside those between the cf and mf cf low bed sediments more closely associate with the ss of all other sites compared to the other bed sites this is likely attributed to the fact that this site acts as a control and is the only to be outside of the mf influence this also suggests that the presence of the mf hydrocarbons alone causes a dramatic increase in expressional diversity the dramatic shifts in the metabolic signatures of both the ss and bed sediments are observed in the differential expression scatterplots from the differential expression analysis supplementary fig s1 here shifts in specific gene expression depending on sample location are evident in the amount of deviation from the overall expressional mean bed sediments in general as mentioned previously generally indicate higher expression magnitudes compared to the ss although there are clearly specific genes and clusters of genes that reveal increased expression at cf low and in the ss the suppression of the sir gene for assimilatory sulfate reduction alongside an increase in the genes for dissimilatory sulfate reduction dsrab aprab indicates a shift from energy consuming to energy producing activity similar to the noted shift in nitrogen metabolism this shift of assimilating these sulfur compounds towards the production of sulfides could be the energy source for the anoxygenic phototrophs mentioned earlier this noted abundance of phototrophic sulfur bacteria and sulfur cycling genes here alongside adjacent freshwater reservoirs in the region provides insight into their apparent significance in the region reid et al 2019 it has been observed that anoxygenic phototrophs will dominate in oligotrophic systems and exceeds primary production rates of oxygenic phototrophs by a large margin the dense microbial mats that likely inhabit these sediments containing micro redox zones of both sulfate and sulfide has been suggested to act as an almost closed system limiting the reduction of oxygen in some systems the oxidation of sulfides within these bed sediments has been up to 100 resulting from the dense communities residing within layered biofilms dworkin et al 2006 this therefore explains the relatively little sulfur metabolism observed within the water column compared to the bed sediments the increased expression of both methanogenic and methane oxidizing transcripts suggests a shift towards a biodegradation dominated metabolic signature of these sites what is interesting is the closely co expressed nature of several of the methanogenic transcripts mcr and mtr with biodegradation genes benb bbsbd in fact the most significantly over expressed genes at mf med was the mcrcd and mtrc genes both responsible for different segments of the larger methanogenic pathway the mcr gene and its various subunits are well known methanogenic markers and are known indicators of biodegradation activity mckay et al 2017 reid et al 2018 2019 vigneron et al 2017 the mtr gene a membrane bound methyltransferase is also responsible for methane production though is perhaps the less studied of the two responsible for the extrusion of a sodium ion from the cell mtr subunits provide the necessary cellular chemiosmotic gradients for final steps of the methanogenic pathway this is also an energy conservation mechanism perhaps allowing for the continuation of these processes under potentially limited thermodynamic constraints the dependence on this cellular sodium pump could also suggest a broader salinity impact on the expression of the methanogenic pathways observed here other studies have indicated the impacts of nacl on methanogenesis though in different environmental contexts waldron et al 2007 if valid a genetic response related to salinity gradients in the environment could be an ideal marker for industrial oil sands inputs given their highly saline nature volik et al 2017 warren et al 2016 though all methanogenic pathways lead to ch4 the mechanism and phylogenetic diversity of the organisms that lead to this point are quite diverse this provides an interesting future direction from which to move towards an increased specificity of methanogenic biomarkers depending on the compound of interest this too could be extended to other gene groups and subunits where specific environmental stimuli could induce slightly altered expressional patterns potentially useful for source tracking research tracking other nutrient gradients i e carbon nitrates and phosphorus would likely induce a similar alteration to the characteristics of the in situ microbial metabolism as observed here shifts in basic physico chemical parameters such as do salinity and conductivity can and will induce a genetic response that could be elucidated through these same shotgun gene expression surveys the induced response from any environmental stimuli causes what is in essence a cooperative response by groups or communities of microbes and never isolated to single microbial taxa in situ integrating genomics techniques such as these where clusters of co expressed genes can be traced alongside conventional chemical tracer approaches is the next step in characterizing the biological impact of compounds as they move through our surrounding environments the ability to genetically determine how target substances effect the natural microbiology of a system provides researchers with a more holistic understanding of the bio transformations and or biodegradation trends associated with the given compound of interest 4 conclusions a major challenge facing mining companies and environmental scientists globally is trying to evaluate the extent to which anthropogenic practices are affecting the surrounding natural environment this paper provides insights for intriguing avenues from which to begin unravelling these complex problems this is the first study to explicitly characterize the natural microbial community function in reference to a true baseline reference site upstream of the mcmurray formation and its ubiquitous hydrocarbon rich composition additionally these are the first results to identify microbial gene expression trends in a compound tracking context whereby functional trends are directly correlated to the environmental hydrocarbon gradient measured in both the ss and bed sediments these results along with the pac characteristics provides powerful insight into not only the mcmurray formation s impact on both the ss and bed sediment biogeochemistry but also on the prospect of microbial functional biomarkers for tracking hydrocarbon exposures in other dynamic aquatic ecosystems results clearly show that the complexities of specific gene subunits can and do provide significant insight into the fundamental metabolic preferences within a given ecosystem there are fundamental differences in expression pathways between ss and bed sediments and as such future studies characterizing river continuums should be aware of these differences in designing their research approach alterations are clearly observed for not only genes responsible for metabolizing these

18415,within all aquatic environments aside from the physical dispersal of dissolved and or particulate phase contaminants alteration from both biological and chemical processes are shown to change the chemistry of the parent compounds often these alterations can lead to secondary influences because of cooperative microbial processes i e coupled respiratory pathways and or energy and biodegradation cycles complicating our understanding of the biological impact that these mobile compounds impose on ecosystem health the mcmurray formation mf the formation constituting the minable bituminous oil sands is a natural ongoing source of hydrocarbon bound sediments to river ecosystems in the region via terrestrial and aquatic erosion providing a natural mesocosm to track and characterize the effects of these compounds on regional aquatic primary productivity here we characterize the natural in situ microbial response to increasing hydrocarbon exposure along a river continuum in the downstream direction using the steepbank river stb suspended and bed sediment samples were collected at 3 sites from upstream to downstream as the water flows into and through the mf samples were then analyzed for the active in situ gene expression of the microbial communities results from both suspended and bed sediments show clear and significant shifts in the microbial metabolic processes within each respective compartment in response to the elevated polycyclic aromatic compound pac concentrations specific genes likely responsible for hydrocarbon breakdown alkane monooxygenase benzoyl coa reductase etc experience elevated expression levels while certain energy metabolism genes nitrogen sulfur methane reveal fundamental shifts in their pathway specificity indicating an adaptation response in their basic energy metabolism expression from suspended sediments reveal subtle yet delayed metabolic response further downstream compared to bed sediments indicative of the erosion and transport dynamics within a lotic system these results provide insight into the use of novel clusters of gene biomarkers to track the active in situ microbial response of both emerging and legacy contaminants such information will be important in determining the best management strategies for the monitoring and assessment of aquatic health in both natural and contaminated ecosystems graphical abstract image 1 keywords metatranscriptomics biomarkers hydrocarbons sediments suspended oil sands 1 introduction while water quality and ecological changes within the lower athabasca river lar are often perceived to be resultant from industrial oil sand deposit exploitation the differentiation of industrial versus natural contributions of pacs is a complex and yet unresolved issue additionally there has yet to be definitive studies identifying fundamental biogeochemical shifts attributed to this natural pac signature no proven fingerprinting method to achieve the above has been proven or accredited to date culp et al 2018 further culp et al 2018 have suggested that while there is significant data on particulate atmospheric deposition there is limited information birks et al 2017 or model that can project the proportion of surface wash off that enters a river course as such droppo et al 2018 suggests that most of the pacs that are transported within the rivers of the lar are derived from hillslope and channel erosion of the mcmurray formation mf the geologic formation that defines the minable oil sands deposit and not from direct or atmospheric anthropogenic inputs regardless of pac source a substantive knowledge gap in relation to how the microbial consortium 1 is influenced by the high hydrocarbon content of the sediments suspended and bed and 2 on how the microbes influence the contaminant speciation of the pacs both of these synonymous biochemical processes will inevitably alter the biogeochemical footprints with concomitant impacts on the natural ecology while most studies of contaminants and microbial impacts in rivers have been studied only on the bed sediment community structure e g biofilms yergeau et al 2012 few studies have characterized the dynamics of bitumen containing suspended sediment ss within rivers of the lar droppo et al 2018 did observe temporal and spatial trends in ss loads and pac signatures with distance downstream for the ells and steepbank stb rivers using passive ss samplers they however did not investigate any microbial influence relative to these spatial and temporal trends recent studies have begun to unravel the natural microbial structure within bed sediments in the region reid et al 2018 2019 yergeau et al 2012 though there remains a lack of understanding with respect to the true microbial function within the entire region including for both ss and bed sediments further there are to our knowledge no studies that provide potential gene biomarkers which reveal statistically differing expression patterns as a direct result to increasing hydrocarbon exposure of the mf tracking contaminants is clearly not a new area of research for years scientists have studied contaminant sites such as those of the exxon valdez oil spill and the deep water horizon disaster in most studies tracking contaminant distribution conventional geochemical testing in association with taxonomic surveys only provides researchers a glimpse into the effects these contaminants have on the natural ecology what has been missing is how the primary producers such as the diverse microbial communities found in all lakes rivers and streams deal with the stressors resulting from the exposure to various compounds shifts in the functional attributes of microbial communities are direct and primary biological responses that can induce ecosystem wide alteration what is too often the case is that contaminant sites are only studied after contamination has occurred leaving a knowledge gap as to the true baseline character of the ecosystem prior to xenobiotic exposure this study uses metatranscriptomics analyses to determine the efficiency of shotgun gene expression surveys for tracking the microbial response to increasing hydrocarbon exposure in ss and bed sediments through the river continuum of the steepbank river stb of the lar alberta canada a control location upstream of the natural hydrocarbon deposit mf provide our reference site within the same river continuum clearwater formation cf this research aims to provide 1 insight into the natural genetic response of microbes to increasing hydrocarbon exposure and 2 provide potential gene biomarkers that reveal statistically differing expression patterns as a direct result to increasing hydrocarbon exposure this has strong implications worldwide where gene expression surveys of aquatic microbial communities could be ideal tools in tracking contaminant exposure as an alternative or augmentation to conventional geochemical fingerprinting practices 2 methods 2 1 sampling site descriptions samples were collected on the steepbank river stb at three sites representing a gradient of pac concentrations from upstream to downstream fig 1 in october 2017 the middle to lower reaches of stb cuts through the mf the ore deposit constituting the athabasca oil sands the upstream site was located within the cf and as such contained marginal to no bitumen sample sites from upstream to downstream are therefore designated cf low mf med and mf high all samples are presumed to represent the natural pac characteristics of the stb given there are legislated no direct discharges from industrial properties if there were an input it can only be from atmospheric deposition which will be highly diluted by the volume of water in the rivers and the primary source of particle load being from the channel itself droppo et al 2018 the stb flows from the east with an elevation change from 625 to 320 m at the confluence with the athabasca river fig 1 mf is composed of minable bitumen rich deposits combined with fine to coarse grained sand interbedded with lesser amounts of silt and clay musial et al 2012 stb has a mean annual flow of 4 8 m3 s 1 and is considered a groundwater dominated river with an average of 50 of flow derived from groundwater gibson et al 2016 2 2 sediment collection sediments were collected from both the river beds and suspended particulates bed sediments consisting of the interface down to approximately 1 cm depth were collected in triplicate into sterile 5 ml cryotubes and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen in the field for nucleic acid extractions bulk sediments were collected into 500 ml hdpe nalgene bottles with no headspace and kept frozen until analysis suspended sediments were collected by a portable continuous flow centrifugation alfa laval model wsb 103b water was pumped 4 l min 1 to the centrifuge by a 5c md march submersible pump located in the middle of the river at mid depth recovery of ss was greater than 90 recovery outflow tss inflow tss sediment collected in the centrifuge bowl was immediately removed and placed in 5 ml cryotubes and flash frozen as above total pac data from each sampling location was obtained from the regional aquatics monitoring program ramp database ramp 2015 2 3 sem analysis bulk bed sediments were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy sem to understand particle distribution and evidence for hydrocarbon signatures specifically the environmental scanning electron microscope fei quanta200f eindhoven netherlands was used at the great lakes institute for environmental research glier university of windsor windsor on canada here analyses were performed at high vacuum 20 kv with a theoretical spot size of 2 6 nm grain inspections and size distributions were performed using both secondary electron se and backscattered electron bse detectors elemental composition analysis was performed with the edax sili detector edax mahwah new jersey usa 2 4 dna rna extractions library preparation total environmental dna extractions were performed according to manufacturer protocols in duplicate using the mobio powersoil total dna isolation kits now qiagen dneasy powersoil kit dna was amplified and purified according to reid et al 2016 to specifically explore the v5 v6 region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene briefly the v5 v6 region was amplified using dual polymerase chain reactions pcr followed by a second barcoding pcr to uniquely identify samples for pooling and sequencing on the ion torrent pgm platform life technologies carlsbad california at the great lakes institute for environmental research at the university of windsor windsor ontario canada pooled dna libraries were checked for quality assurances and concentration on the agilent 2100 bioanalyzer prior to sequencing total environmental rna extractions were performed using the mobio powersoil total rna isolation kits mobio laboratories carlsbad california per slightly modified protocols initial sediment quantity for extraction was bumped to 5 g to increase overall rna yield all reagents and samples were kept on ice throughout extraction to maintain rna integrity and minimize degradation throughout the extraction quality and concentrations were analyzed on the agilent 2100 bioanalyzer where concentrations exceeded 100 ng μl and quality scores exceeded rin of 7 5 samples of sufficient quality and concentration were sent in duplicate to genome quebec innovation center at mcgill university in montreal quebec canada there samples were again checked to ensure they met quality control standards and rrna depletion illumina ribo zero rrna removal kit bacterial and yeast was performed to enhance the mrna concentration samples were then sequenced on the illumina hiseq 4000 nextgen sequencer 2 5 16s rrna community structure analysis microbial taxonomy was analyzed to augment the metatranscriptomics functional dataset providing information as to which microbes were likely associated with observed gene expression raw sequence files were processed through the macqiime v 1 9 1 pipeline www qiime org an open source bioinformatics pipeline for 16s rrna amplicon sequences caporaso et al 2010 sequence files were filtered and sequences with a phred score below 20 were omitted sequences were then clustered into operational taxonomic units otus omitting singletons and doubletons at a similarity threshold of 97 using the uclust algorithm chimeras were removed using the usearch61 algorithm with macqiime taxonomy was assigned to representative otu sequences for each cluster using the default greengenes database at a 90 confidence threshold desantis et al 2006 relative abundances of reads per sample were calculated to gain an understanding of the dominant taxa between sample sites 2 6 metatranscriptomics data processing and differential expression analysis all raw metatranscriptomics sequence data was processed through the mg rast metagenomics rapid annotation using subsystem technology pipeline meyer et al 2008 this automated pipeline was designed for the analysis of high throughput sequencing datasets proving both functional and phylogenetic summaries raw paired end sequence files were submitted where pairing quality filtering and the annotation of functional genes was performed a phred quality score of 30 was applied to submitted raw sequence files transcripts were annotated to the ko kegg orthology database visualizations for gene expression correlations was then performed using the start app a web based rnaseq analysis and visualization resource nelson et al 2017 raw expression values were normalized to counts per million cpm using the limma package linear models for microarray and rna seq data of r bioconductor within the start application gene expression boxplots are expressed as logcpm values and p values are provided where statistical significance is noted mean variance modelling at the observation level voom was utilized for the logcpm determination expression heatmaps were created through heatmapper a free online server for the creation of heatmaps and other visualization tools babicki et al 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characteristics of suspended and bed sediments spatial trends of pac concentrations in the suspended and bed sediments of the stb were measured at the 3 sample sites supplementary table s1 pac concentrations indicate a generally increasing load of pac moving downstream from cl low upstream to mf high downstream overall there is a significant increase in total pac as exposure increases through the mf fig 2 with concentrations totaling 34 8 118 3 and 425 5 ng l at cf low mf med and mf high respectively these findings correlate with those of droppo et al 2018 who also observed increases in pac loadings in the ss moving through the formation in the stb the highest concentration pacs were alkylated compounds specifically c2 c3 c4 dibenzothiphenes c2 c3 c4 phenanthrenes anthracenes c2 fluoranthenes pyrenes and c4 napthalenes these alkyl homologs are indicative of the mf and have been used as indicators of the bitumen deposit in various other studies as they can reveal minute variations within the deposit droppo et al 2018 scanning electron microscopy also revealed similar trends of increasing hydrocarbon concentrations within the bed sediment fig 3 shows the interstitial hydrocarbon content of the bed sediments where increasing carbon content correlates to the observed bituminous compounds within the interstitial sediment grains raman spectroscopy specifically confirmed the bitumen content within mf high revealing peaks suggestive of raw bitumen results not presented the presence of bitumen in the interstitial pore spaces of several prepared sem slides portrays the truly ubiquitous presence of the pacs in the sediments of the mf additionally visual analysis on the sem appeared to show a decreasing trend in particle size distribution from cf low to mf high sediment particles appeared to be well sorted upstream of the mf though became more varied as exposure to the mf increased it is interesting to note that cf low does in fact contain some measurable pacs despite being outside of the mcmurray formation though no bitumen was observable under the sem however this could be attributed to natural pacs resulting from combustion of organics such as wood or grasses or perhaps some other anthropogenic influence e g atmospheric deposition this is especially relevant in this region where a large forest fire swept through a year earlier and would have inevitably introduced a pac signature to the natural landscape however this type of pac is indicative of pyrogenic origin and thus is chemically different than the pac signature of the mf droppo et al 2018 indicated that there was a correlation between wood grass coal burning and low flow events which may be what we are observing here nonetheless there was no visible evidence of bitumen derived from the mf within the sediments observed under the sem these chemical characterizations of increasing pac load within the ss and the associated microscopy results reveal considerable hydrocarbon content that is not only highly concentrated in the bed sediments but is readily eroded and transported through the water column and downstream these hydrocarbon signatures in both the water and sediment compartment provides an ideal opportunity to characterize how the microbial community is dealing with such a unique hydrodynamic sediment regime under varying pac exposures 3 2 microbial community structure functional dynamics 3 2 1 sequencing summaries and statistics the metataxonomic analysis consisted of a total of 12 single end sequence files averaging 88 995 raw sequences per sample clustering resulted in a total of 19 925 unique otus at a 97 similarity threshold the metatranscriptomics dataset also consisted of 12 paired end sequence files with over 39 million reads per sample averaging 46 549 109 sequences each with phred quality scores all 30 read annotation resulted in reads mapped to basic cellular processes genetic information processing and environmental information processing alongside extensive coverage of metabolic pathways indicative of energy metabolism of interest herein i e nitrogen sulfur methane cycling sequence files for both 16s rrna and metatranscriptomics are submitted to the ncbi sequence read archive sra under the project number prjna564313 3 2 2 microbial community structure 16s rrna gene amplicon metataxonomic analyses were performed to understand how the exposure of mf hydrocarbons may have altered the taxonomic distribution at each site figs 4 and 5 clearly illustrate a shift in the microbial structure between the ss and bed sediments most prominent is the dominance of proteobacteria in both the ss and bed sediments constituting approximately 61 59 and 66 of the community within the ss and only about 41 43 and 47 in the bed sediments of cf low mf med and mf high respectively in general ss is more abundant in actinobacteria cyanobacteria and proteobacteria compared to the bed at each respective site bed sediments showed similar trends in community structure as previous studies with more abundant acidobacteria bacteroidetes chlorobi chloroflexi firmicutes plantomycetes spirochaetes and verrumicrobia representing a diverse microbial assemblage capable of thriving in this unique environment yergeau et al 2012 acidobacteria though remaining poorly understood are a diverse range of organisms ubiquitous in soils and sediments naether et al 2012 of note is the family holophagaceae containing genera capable of aromatic compound degradation and geothrix and anaerobic chemoorganotroph generally utilizing fe iii as its electron acceptor bacteroidetes also comprise a diverse range of organisms and was second in abundance overall behind the proteobacteria one of the most dominant families of bacteroidetes was cytophagaceae within this family a novel genus dyadobacter is known to degrade xenobiotic compounds in aromatic hydrocarbon contaminated soils willumsen et al 2005 dyadobacter was most observed here to be most abundant in the ss at mf med though these were at relatively low abundances overall still the overall high abundance of cytophagaceae suggests that there may be other genera of similar metabolic capabilities responsible for degradation of similarly complex carbon compounds chlorobi contains organisms that are both anaerobic photoautotrophs alongside obligate heterotrophs and was also found in man made reservoirs in the region reid et al 2019 it s presence in the bed sediments indicates a response to sulfide production deeper within the sediments perhaps also acting as a detoxifier in its oxidation of sulfides chloroflexi are also anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria though some are also able to utilize halogenated compounds as electron acceptors in their respiratory process notable taxonomic families observed include anaerolinaceae and dehalococcoidaceae anaerolinaceae has been found to closely affiliate with methanogenic activity with the ability to activate the breakdown of long chain n alkanes liang et al 2016 dehalococcoidaceae is an organohalide respiring organism known to utilize h2 as its electron donor this is significant as it may suggest a means by which to reduce the build up of h2 because of methanogenic biodegradation processes allowing for these processes to proceed clostridium spp within the firmicutes phylum has been shown to also closely associate with methanogens and has been shown to be highly abundant in oil cultures and toluene degrading methanogenic cultures fowler et al 2016 however it was also noted that they may only be involved in the subsequent breakdown of hydrocarbons after initial activation has taken place fowler et al 2016 the remaining phyla observed plantomycetes spirochaetes and verrumicrobia all represent diverse groups of organisms many of which are commonly found in both soils and marine and freshwater environments worldwide it is interesting to note that there was an increased abundance of the proteobacteria and cyanobacteria within the ss within the cyanobacteria phylum particularly dominant was the family of nostocaceae known for its nitrogen fixation abilities reid et al 2019 also observed the presence of these organisms in deeper freshwater reservoirs suggesting that there is a significant phototrophic influence on the biogeochemistry of this region the presence of nostocaceae could be suggestive of a syntrophic cooperation with aquatic plants who would benefit from the production of ammonia additionally the production of ammonia could be utilized by other chemoheterotrophs in the breakdown of organics such as the pacs of the mf the increased abundance of cyanobacteria is expected in the ss where ample sunlight is present alongside ample nutrients derived from some of the breakdown processes within the water column or bed sediments the increased abundance of proteobacteria however was somewhat unexpected where betaproteobacteria were largely responsible for this increase betaproteobacteria was the most dominant class overall second only to the alphaproteobacteria fig 5 the prominence of these classes of organisms could be linked to their highly diverse metabolic abilities making them particularly efficient in adapting to the hydrocarbon gradient of the mf dworkin et al 2006 the betaproteobacteria family of comamonadaceae was most dominant in all the ss samples comamonadaceae is an extremely diverse family of organisms harboring genera capable of wide ranging phenotypic abilities noted abilities of comamonadaceae and other families of betaproteobacteria to degrade a variety of petroleum contaminants makes the presence of this organism extremely relevant in the context of this unique hydrocarbon gradient present within the stb mukherjee et al 2017 zedelius et al 2011 additionally betaproteobacteria contain organisms with the ability to oxidize ammonia stein and klotz 2016 part of the nitrification pathway potentially resulting from pac breakdown within the stb perhaps the greatest noted increase from cf low to mf med was in the abundance of spirobacillales an order of deltaproteobacteria spirobacillales is a known degrader of toxins produced by certain cyanobacteria lezcano et al 2017 providing a potentially interesting correlation to the depletion of cyanobacteria noted here also this may be evidence towards the notion of pac inhibition of photosynthetic activity as noted in other studies marwood et al 1999 however this heightened abundance could just be attributed to the increased abundance of complex organics which could also be utilized by spirobacillales lezcano et al 2017 moving downstream from the cf to mf there are clearly changes in the microbial community structure though subtle from upper taxonomic classifications aside from the betaproteobacteria principal coordinate analyses pcoa of all operational taxonomic units otus was implemented to better understand community structure variation between sample sites initially evident is a clear separation of ss from the bed sediments fig 6 coordinate 1 represents over 50 of the variation while coordinate 2 represents approximately 21 cf low ss and bed sediments appear to be the most unique of all the other sites and is the only site showing relatively similar ss and bed sediment communities this is likely attributed to its upstream situation above the mf where it has not yet been influenced by the significant hydrocarbon signature of mf the divergent nature of both the ss and bed sediments from the cf low control site indicates increasing differences in the community structure not only between sites but also within site ss and bed samples mf med ss and bed sediments are most divergent from the cf low sites perhaps representative of its sudden hydrocarbon signature moving into the mf it is interesting that mf high is taxonomically more closely related to cf low especially given its geographically the most distant sampling site and exhibits the highest pac signature overall however what this may be suggesting is that by mf high given enough exposure time within the mf the microbial community has adapted or equilibrated to the altered environmental stimuli of the mf the microbial community at mf med may be under a drastic state of flux or adaptation which is perhaps inducing rapid alteration to the dna signature resulting in the heightened variation at the otu level nonetheless this data suggests that the use of pcoa and similarity indices bray curtis in this case do reveal shifts in the community composition because of hydrocarbon exposure though not necessarily indicative of the stepwise increase of pacs observed down the river continuum 3 2 3 suspended sediment microbial function the microbial gene expression associated with the suspended sediment ss observed through the stb river continuum reveals significant shifts in the metabolic pathways in response to the incremental increases in pac content moving downstream from cf low through to mf high fig 7 these metabolic shifts were observed despite extremely low turbidity levels 5 ntu and cold water temperatures 10 c at the time of sampling in higher turbidity instances and warmer summer temperatures one could reasonably expect an even greater biotic signature to be ascertained through these metatranscriptomics approaches in the ss samples there is a significant suppression of several energy metabolism genes including nitrogen fixation nitrite reductase and assimilatory sulfate reductase additionally there is significant suppression of photosynthetic genes responsible for both the coloring of cyanobacteria cpcef genes for phycocyanobilin lyase logfc 2 06 p 0 05 and the photosystem i and ii systems psa and psb found in phototrophic organisms logfc 1 p 0 05 this suggests a fundamental shift in natural metabolic character of the microbes including the phototrophic communities residing within the water column this suppression of genes specific to cyanobacteria and their photosynthetic functions correlate to the decrease in cyanobacterial abundance noted within the 16s rrna amplicon data alongside other studies which revealed photosynthetic inhibition due to pac presence marwood et al 1999 however there is a significant increase in the expression of bchqr genes responsible for the photosynthetic function of green sulfur bacteria anoxygenic phototrophs relying on sulfides as an electron source this may indicate a shift towards a more sulfide rich system moving towards mf high dissimilatory sulfate reductase genes dsrab aprab and methanogenesis genes mcr and mtr showed relatively consistent expression within the ss through to mf high however methane oxidation transcripts mxaf methanol dehydrogenase show signficantly increasing expression logfc 0 774 p 0 05 moving downstream with some of the overall highest expression noted in the ss further the expression of amoab ammonia monooxygenase showed a gradual increase in expression moving downstream as well previously shown to be correlated to hydrocarbon exposure and metabolism dolan et al 2010 urakawa et al 2019 this too may correlate to the highly abundant betaproteobacteria some of which harbor these same genes for ammonia oxidation these iterative expression changes correlating to the stepwise increase in hydrocarbon content indicates that even the microbial community within the ss in the water column which likely has lower cellular density than in the bed is experiencing significant alteration to their upstream metabolic signature which is in fact measureable utilizing these shotgun rnaseq protocols the increased expression of methanotrophic genes i e methane oxidation indicate that perhaps the microbial population is adapting to the changes in hydrocarbon content whereby enhanced methanogenic activity from below see 3 2 4 is being at least partially offset by the methanotrophs in the overlying water further the fact that many of the significantly differentially expressed genes belong to the broader categories of environmental information processing and cellular processes indicates that the microbial communities travelling on or with the ss are experiencing dramatic changes in their core cellular functionality not just their energy metabolism alone aside from energy metabolism pathways dominant trends where also observed in the expression of known biodegradation genes within the ss there were significantly increasing trends from cf low through mf med to mf high of several known hydrocarbon degradation genes including but not imited to alkane monooxygenase alkb benzoyl coa reductase baddefg nitronate monooxygenase nmo and hydroxybenzoate monooxygenase poba logfc 0 15 p 0 05 there was also a spike in the expression of benzylsuccinate coa bbsb at both mf med and mf high compared to cf low logfc 2 though this was not significantly different p 0 268 the expression of alkb may correlate to the highly abundant alpha beta and gammaproteobacteria classes alongside actinobacteria who all contain closely related homolog genes for alkane degradation the magnitude of these fold changes are low though this is somewhat expected given that what we are observing are small communities of microbes in transit within the water column there is likely little in the way of redundancy in their functional abilities beyond necessary cell survival so even small changes observed here may be relatively drastic in terms of their overall functional characteristic the signficant increase in gene expressions noted here indicate that the microbial community suspended in the water column are directly responding to the hydrocarbon influence of the mf altering their natural energy metabolisms to adjust towards a seemingly increased biodegradation capacity within the mf this abundance and specificity of the significantly different transcripts within ss are potential targets from which to evaluate genes for the purpose of hydrocarbon compound tracking in other freshwater environments 3 2 4 bed sediment microbial function similar to the ss analyses bed sediment community functions shifted significantly in response to the mfs hydrocarbon influence the absolute magnitude of expressions from within the bed sediments was generally significantly higher than that of the ss aside from methanotrophy likely related to the increased cell density within the sediments the above is also evidenced in the magnitude of change exhibited by the genes mentioned previously here similar trends in the expression of specific energy metabolism pathways were observed though almost all indicate suppression dissimilatory and assimilatory nitrate reductase and assimilatory sulfate reductase both showed signs of suppression in both mf med and mf high within mf high however dissimilatory nitrate reductase expression was considerably higher than cf low this would suggest a shift in the general nitrogen metabolism moving into the mf noted by the increased dissimilatory nitrate reduction genes ammonium monooxygenase amoabc dissimilatory sulfate reductase dsrab and aprab and methanogenesis mcr and mtr genes saw sharp increases in expression at mf med followed by a slight decrease in the mf high location these coinsiding increases in dissimilatory processes may be evidence of energy conservation strategies in response to an overall shift towards biodegradation or perhaps a response to the increased nutrient availability associated with the pacs present the differential expression analyses between mf med and cf low shows several mtr and mcr subunits as the most highly overexpressed in mf med logfc 2 p 0 05 clearly a response to the increase pac exposure also observed in previous studies within the mf reid et al 2019 2018 known and identified biodegradation genes within bed sediments also exhibit a clear response to mf exposure here showing a generally increasing expression moving from clear water formation upstream to mcmurray formation downstream alkane monooxygenase alkb benzoyl coa reductase baddefg nitronate monooxygenase nmo and benzoylsuccinyl coa dehydrogenase bbsbd all show increasing expression moving downstream towards mf high specifically significant overexpression of alkb baddefg and bbsbd was observed between mf high and cf low logfc 1 p 0 05 these elevated expression levels further support a specific genetic response to increasing exposure to elevated hydrocarbon levels indicating their potential as pac biomarkers further downstream it is interesting to note that some of these biodegradation expression signatures appeared to be expressed earlier in the bed sediments than in the ss again possibly due to of the lag time needed for sediments to become suspended in the water column from surface washoff or channel erosion 3 2 5 identifying contaminant gradients and their impacts on microbial metabolic expression the breadth of data obtained through shotgun metatranscriptomics surveys is immense making it difficult to effectively efficiently and accurately correlate trends in gene expression patterns however by making observations of clusters of closely co expressing genes one can overcome variation potentially attributed to the expression of single genes in situ and make more robust inferences based on redundant genetic response by observing these metabolic signatures via expression heatmap fig 7 and computing average linkage clustering between certain genes it becomes evident that there are contrasting functional characteristics between ss and bed sediments alongside those between the cf and mf cf low bed sediments more closely associate with the ss of all other sites compared to the other bed sites this is likely attributed to the fact that this site acts as a control and is the only to be outside of the mf influence this also suggests that the presence of the mf hydrocarbons alone causes a dramatic increase in expressional diversity the dramatic shifts in the metabolic signatures of both the ss and bed sediments are observed in the differential expression scatterplots from the differential expression analysis supplementary fig s1 here shifts in specific gene expression depending on sample location are evident in the amount of deviation from the overall expressional mean bed sediments in general as mentioned previously generally indicate higher expression magnitudes compared to the ss although there are clearly specific genes and clusters of genes that reveal increased expression at cf low and in the ss the suppression of the sir gene for assimilatory sulfate reduction alongside an increase in the genes for dissimilatory sulfate reduction dsrab aprab indicates a shift from energy consuming to energy producing activity similar to the noted shift in nitrogen metabolism this shift of assimilating these sulfur compounds towards the production of sulfides could be the energy source for the anoxygenic phototrophs mentioned earlier this noted abundance of phototrophic sulfur bacteria and sulfur cycling genes here alongside adjacent freshwater reservoirs in the region provides insight into their apparent significance in the region reid et al 2019 it has been observed that anoxygenic phototrophs will dominate in oligotrophic systems and exceeds primary production rates of oxygenic phototrophs by a large margin the dense microbial mats that likely inhabit these sediments containing micro redox zones of both sulfate and sulfide has been suggested to act as an almost closed system limiting the reduction of oxygen in some systems the oxidation of sulfides within these bed sediments has been up to 100 resulting from the dense communities residing within layered biofilms dworkin et al 2006 this therefore explains the relatively little sulfur metabolism observed within the water column compared to the bed sediments the increased expression of both methanogenic and methane oxidizing transcripts suggests a shift towards a biodegradation dominated metabolic signature of these sites what is interesting is the closely co expressed nature of several of the methanogenic transcripts mcr and mtr with biodegradation genes benb bbsbd in fact the most significantly over expressed genes at mf med was the mcrcd and mtrc genes both responsible for different segments of the larger methanogenic pathway the mcr gene and its various subunits are well known methanogenic markers and are known indicators of biodegradation activity mckay et al 2017 reid et al 2018 2019 vigneron et al 2017 the mtr gene a membrane bound methyltransferase is also responsible for methane production though is perhaps the less studied of the two responsible for the extrusion of a sodium ion from the cell mtr subunits provide the necessary cellular chemiosmotic gradients for final steps of the methanogenic pathway this is also an energy conservation mechanism perhaps allowing for the continuation of these processes under potentially limited thermodynamic constraints the dependence on this cellular sodium pump could also suggest a broader salinity impact on the expression of the methanogenic pathways observed here other studies have indicated the impacts of nacl on methanogenesis though in different environmental contexts waldron et al 2007 if valid a genetic response related to salinity gradients in the environment could be an ideal marker for industrial oil sands inputs given their highly saline nature volik et al 2017 warren et al 2016 though all methanogenic pathways lead to ch4 the mechanism and phylogenetic diversity of the organisms that lead to this point are quite diverse this provides an interesting future direction from which to move towards an increased specificity of methanogenic biomarkers depending on the compound of interest this too could be extended to other gene groups and subunits where specific environmental stimuli could induce slightly altered expressional patterns potentially useful for source tracking research tracking other nutrient gradients i e carbon nitrates and phosphorus would likely induce a similar alteration to the characteristics of the in situ microbial metabolism as observed here shifts in basic physico chemical parameters such as do salinity and conductivity can and will induce a genetic response that could be elucidated through these same shotgun gene expression surveys the induced response from any environmental stimuli causes what is in essence a cooperative response by groups or communities of microbes and never isolated to single microbial taxa in situ integrating genomics techniques such as these where clusters of co expressed genes can be traced alongside conventional chemical tracer approaches is the next step in characterizing the biological impact of compounds as they move through our surrounding environments the ability to genetically determine how target substances effect the natural microbiology of a system provides researchers with a more holistic understanding of the bio transformations and or biodegradation trends associated with the given compound of interest 4 conclusions a major challenge facing mining companies and environmental scientists globally is trying to evaluate the extent to which anthropogenic practices are affecting the surrounding natural environment this paper provides insights for intriguing avenues from which to begin unravelling these complex problems this is the first study to explicitly characterize the natural microbial community function in reference to a true baseline reference site upstream of the mcmurray formation and its ubiquitous hydrocarbon rich composition additionally these are the first results to identify microbial gene expression trends in a compound tracking context whereby functional trends are directly correlated to the environmental hydrocarbon gradient measured in both the ss and bed sediments these results along with the pac characteristics provides powerful insight into not only the mcmurray formation s impact on both the ss and bed sediment biogeochemistry but also on the prospect of microbial functional biomarkers for tracking hydrocarbon exposures in other dynamic aquatic ecosystems results clearly show that the complexities of specific gene subunits can and do provide significant insight into the fundamental metabolic preferences within a given ecosystem there are fundamental differences in expression pathways between ss and bed sediments and as such future studies characterizing river continuums should be aware of these differences in designing their research approach alterations are clearly observed for not only genes responsible for metabolizing these hydrocarbons alkb badb bbsbd etc but also the fundamental energy metabolism processes governing this ecosystem s microbial communities shifts from assimilatory to dissimilatory reduction processes give interesting insight into fundamental shifts in the flow of energy through these systems and reveal how widely ecosystems can be impacted biologically these advancements in contaminant biogeochemical studies exemplified here provide avenues from which to explore bioassay surveys isolating specific gene clusters for targeting and tracking specific compound exposures there is a need to further our understanding of how entire microbial communities behave in the presence of contaminants moving beyond single microbe studies to understand entire community dynamics the very nature of microbial plasticity allows them to be extremely effective and efficient in their metabolic capabilities when in the presence of other microbes and any given environmental stimuli by harnessing and unravelling their complex genetic response the novel tools exemplified here have great potential moving forward for unravelling the movement of compounds through hydrodynamic environments worldwide

18416,the use of molecular probe technology is demonstrated for routine identification and tracking of cultured and uncultured microorganisms in an activated sludge bioreactor treating domestic wastewater a key advantage of molecular probe technology is that it can interrogate hundreds of microbial species of interest in a single measurement in environmental niches where a single genus such as competibacteraceae dominates it can be difficult and expensive to identify microorganisms that are present at low relative abundance with molecular probe technology it is straightforward members of the competibacteraceae family none of which have been grown in pure culture are abundant in an activated sludge system in the san francisco bay area california usa molecular probe ensembles with and without competibacteraceae probes were constructed whereas the probe ensemble with competibacteraceae probes identified a total of ten bacteria the molecular probe ensemble without competibacteraceae probes identified 29 bacteria including many at low relative abundance and including some species of public health significance graphical abstract image 1 keywords activated sludge bacteria molecular probes 1 introduction biological water resource recovery relies upon complex self assembled microbial communities to purify wastewater these systems must be reliable and robust in order to protect the environment and public health rittmann et al 2006 effective monitoring is needed because process upsets at water resource recovery facilities wrrfs can often be attributed to a change in the relative abundance of a subpopulation of microorganisms graham and smith 2004 appropriate corrective actions for these upsets often rely on proper identification of functionally important species seviour and nielsen 2010 tandoi et al 2015 therefore robust monitoring methods are required to diagnose process upsets of the several monitoring methods in common use each has advantages and disadvantages microscopic identification is often used to monitor filamentous microorganisms jenkins et al 2004 seviour and nielsen 2010 although this procedure is inexpensive unrelated organisms often look very similar and cannot be distinguished adequately cultivation of microorganisms is employed for identification based on metabolism but this method only identifies microorganisms that can be grown in culture the majority of species in activated sludge have not been grown in culture solden et al 2016 zhang et al 2012 fluorescence in situ hybridization fish daims et al 2006 he et al 2007 can be used to probe the identity of specific microorganisms or genes of interest but is a low throughput technology microarray analyses phylochip and geochip zhou et al 2015 enable higher throughput but many probe sequences fail to resolve species level taxonomy using 16s ribosomal rna or dna quantitative pcr qpcr is sensitive and quantitative but only one microorganism or at most a few may be evaluated at a time the reason is that there are a limited number of fluorescent dyes that may be combined and measured simultaneously interrogating hundreds of microorganisms in one tube is not feasible amplification and sequencing of 16s rrna genes has been used extensively but all amplification primers have been shown to harbor biases albertsen et al 2015 metagenomic shotgun sequencing guo et al 2016 can identify and assemble the sequence reads corresponding to the 16s ribosomal dnas or portions thereof this procedure appears to have little bias but its efficacy is highly dependent on the depth of sequencing because fewer than 5 of the sequence reads are actually employed in complex systems that require the identification and monitoring of dozens to hundreds of microorganisms molecular probe technology is especially useful molecular probe technology is a robust culture independent and multiplexed means of identifying bacteria present at even low abundances xu et al 2014 a diagram of a molecular probe is shown in fig s1 supplementary material to enable multiplexed detection a probe ensemble can be easily created by mixing probes targeting those bacteria in this study molecular probe technology was applied to study samples of activated sludge taken monthly over a period of 22 months from the secondary treatment system at a wrrf in the san francisco bay area california usa within this plant s secondary system bacteria of the competibacteraceae family are dominant members of the microbial community likely because of the operation of a first stage anaerobic selector followed by pure oxygen aeration brand et al 2019 an ensemble of molecular probes was employed to interrogate two competibacteraceae clades and hundreds of other bacteria monthly over a course of 22 months 2 materials and methods 2 1 raw wastewater to mixed liquor suspended solids mlss weekly grab composite samples of mlss were collected from the secondary treatment system at the wrrf in the san francisco bay area in northern california usa the wrrf treats an average of 63 million gallons of wastewater per day from domestic and industrial sources raw sewage passes through grit removal and primary sedimentation before passing into secondary treatment for organic removal prior to effluent discharge into san francisco bay this process consists of a four stage pure oxygen aeration system where the first stage is operated as an anaerobic selector in addition the wrrf operates an anaerobic digester for biosolids and high strength trucked waste centrate from this digester is combined with the raw influent upstream of primary sedimentation 2 0 ml samples were centrifuged on site the supernatant decanted and the pelleted mlss stored at 20 c until use 2 2 mlss to total dna one hundred μl of 0 01 m tris 0 001 m edta ph8 5 te were added to a freshly thawed sample of mlss the mixture was vortexed to resuspend the mlss the solution was transferred to a 2 ml microtube containing 0 5 mm rnase dnase free glass beads beadruptor omni international 935 c cobb place blvd kennesaw ga 30144 sixty μl of reagent c1 from a powersoil dna isolation kit mobio laboratories inc 12888 100 2746 loker avenue west carlsbad ca 92010 were added the microtube was placed into the beadruptor the mixture was pulsed for 60 s on high ten times the microtube was centrifuged at 10 000 g for 30 s the liquid and the sds foam 400 500 μl total were transferred to a collection tube thereafter the mobio directions were followed to generate sufficient starting material for the molecular probe reactions the mlss dnas were taken through whole genome amplification wga sigma aldrich corp 3050 spruce st st louis mo 63103 2 3 the molecular probe ensemble oligonucleotide probes were designed as described previously xu et al 2014 in brief the aim was to design and synthesize 20 probes for each bacterial genome or gene sequence the molecular probes were 96 mers composed of two domains a 60 base homology sequence known as a homer identical in sequence to the target genome and divided into two 30 base end sections and a common 36 base interior pcr amplification primer domain fig s1 supplemental material the homers were derived from the genome sequences available on the national center for biotechnology information public website refseq https www ncbi nlm nih gov genome browse overview by applying the custom script blaster rb which is freely available at http med stanford edu sgtc research blaster html whenever possible refseq genome sequences were employed because they are well curated the individual probe designs are shown in table s1 supplemental material for this first group of molecular probes 6872 probes targeting 353 bacteria were designed in addition there were three special cases the bacterium nocardia was one special case two nocardia genome sequences were available nc 006361 a refseq genome of nocardia farcinica and bagg01000000 a whole genome shotgun sequencing assembly of nocardia takedensis twenty probes were designed from each nocardia genome sequence the competibacteraceae bacteria were the second special case because these bacteria have not been grown in culture it is not possible to purify competibacteraceae dna starting with a pure culture although two competibacteraceae genomes from metagenomes were available in the database mcilroy et al 2013 the wide genome sequence diversity of this lineage mcilroy et al 2015a warranted probe design based upon the phylotypes present at this wrrf thus bacterial cells were collected from the mlss samples total dna was prepared from the bacterial cells and shotgun sequenced the resulting sequence reads were assembled into groups of contigs brand et al 2019 the sequences from the most secure contigs in the gcf 001051235 assembly were employed to design 53 probes these were synthesized in house jensen et al 2013 of these molecular probes 42 were later shown to match the dominant competibacteraceae cpb p15 genome none matched the competibacteraceae cpb m38 genome seven matched the competibacteraceae cpb c95 genome one probe matched more than one genome sequence and three probes matched unknown targets in total 6954 molecular probes targeting 356 bacterial genomes were designed for the third special case 179 probes targeting 10 e coli toxin genes aggr bfpa eaea east1 ipah lt sth stp stx1 and stx2 were designed with the exception of the competibacteraceae and nocardia probes all other oligonucleotides were purchased from agilent technologies 5301 stevens creek blvd santa clara ca 95051 in total 7133 oligonucleotides potential molecular probes were synthesized with the exception of the competibacteraceae and nocardia probes all oligonucleotides were subjected to recombinase directed indexing redi to isolate sequence verified molecular probe dna which was then converted to 5 phosphorylated single stranded dna as previously described smith et al 2017 because of the limitations of money and time the redi procedure was discontinued after successfully processing 3356 molecular probes thus the final probe ensemble contained 3398 molecular probes representing 355 bacteria plus 10 toxin genes the individual molecular probe designs are given in table s1 supplemental material within the working ensemble each probe was present at a concentration of 25 zmol μl 2 4 the molecular probe reactions the molecular probe reactions have been described in detail hyman et al 2010 2012 xu et al 2014 each wga mlss dna was taken through this procedure for each of the two probe ensembles with and without competibacteraceae probes 2 5 illumina sequencing for each sample successfully hybridized homer sequences were pcr amplified from exonuclease resistant circular dna with primers recognizing the common priming region of the molecular probes fig s1 supplemental material plus adapter sequences for illumina sequencing 2 6 sequence analysis after de multiplexing paired reads were first matched to build consensus reads this step helped to minimize sequencing error next consensus reads were aligned to the 60 base homer sequences using bowtie2 version 2 2 8 employing the very sensitive setting langmead and salzberg 2012 since the 60 base amplicon is formed by a ligation of the two 30 base ends of the molecular probe the requirement of a proper alignment to the 60 base amplicon assured that a successful ligation had taken place thus the amplicon represented a high confidence sampling of the target genome 2 7 presence call of probes and targets for the illumina sequencing data the p values of presence were computed using a negative binomial model robinson and smyth 2007 each probe was assigned a p value of presence measuring whether the number of observed reads was significantly larger than a random assignment of reads to all probes in the probe ensemble the p value was computed by the following formula p x k r 0 n k k r 1 r 1 p r p k where p is the probability that a random probe received a sequence read 1 3398 k is the number of reads observed and n is the total number of reads mapped a probe with a p value of less than 0 05 was considered positive a bacterium or a target sequence was considered to be present if it had more than a total of five designated probes and at least three of them were positive or if it had fewer than five probes and at least two of them were positive xu et al 2014 as a caution the call of present or absent might be confounded by the unknown affinity of the probe for its target a high affinity probe that attracts more than the average number of sequencing reads would be called positive a low affinity probe that attracts fewer than the average number of sequencing reads would be called negative 2 8 statistical analysis statistical analyses for probe detection were carried out in r2 15 2 plots were generated either in r2 15 2 or microsoft excel 2016 specifically the pheatmap package was applied to draw heatmaps for bacteria detected more than once over the time course using normalized and log2 transformed probe level signal counts per million 2 9 correlation to qpcr a qpcr assay for the competibacteraceae clades present at the wrrf has been described brand et al 2019 the trend for the cpb p15 clade found using the qpcr assay brand et al 2019 was compared to that found with molecular probes for the seventeen sampling dates from may 2014 to october 2015 the data for the qpcr assays in fig 1 were abstracted from brand et al 2019 the analyses used samples that were biological replicates although processed starting with different disruption instruments 3 identification of 16s rrna from shotgun metagenomic sequences dna was sequenced by genewiz south plainfield nj using the illumina hiseq x ten platform to produce 2 x 150 base paired end reads all reads were quality trimmed using the clc genomics workbench v8 0 3 clcbio qiagen with default conditions and removing adapters reads were also merged using this same program all quality trimmed reads were exported in fasta format and processed employing the ssusearch pipeline guo et al 2016 through the alignment and identification of 16s rdna reads mapping to the v4 region individual sample files were then concatenated and imported into qiime caporaso et al 2010 for open reference otu picking rideout et al 2014 against the midas database v 2 1 3 mcilroy et al 2017 2015b reads were clustered at 97 similarity using the sumaclust kopylova et al 2016 and sortmerna kopylova et al 2012 option for pick open reference otu py 3 1 microbial community visualization otu tables were imported into the r environment v 3 4 4 in the r studio ide http www rstudio com using the ampvis2 package andersen et al 2018 to produce heatmap visualizations of the microbial community to construct table 1 from the total table s3 supplementary material bacteria such as propioniciclava and fodinibacter for which there are no genome sequences in refseq and therefore for which no molecular probes could be designed were excluded entities such as novel otu1 and gks98 freshwater group which also have no corresponding genome sequences in refseq were also excluded lastly bacteria such as tetrasphaera and mycobacterium that have refseq genome sequences but were not represented by probes in our ensemble were also excluded probes for these bacteria can be added to the ensemble at any time 4 results 4 1 validation of molecular probes as a monitoring tool for bacteria in activated sludge employing molecular probe technology the relative concentration of competibacteraceae clade cpb p15 was interrogated as a function of time these results were compared to the results obtained with qpcr brand et al 2019 twenty two monthly samples of mixed liquor suspended solids from the secondary system were investigated seventeen of these samples were biological replicates taken on the sampling dates for qpcr brand et al 2019 the competibacteraceae positive ensemble detected the cpb p15 genome at all 22 time points consistent with the qpcr results fig 1 both sets of results show that the signal for cpb p15 was reasonably constant over the first 10 months of 2014 in the last quarter of 2014 the signal began to drop and reached its lowest value in january 2015 before increasing again comparing the trends observed in the molecular probes analysis to those obtained by qpcr across the 17 samples yielded a pearson correlation coefficient of 0 826 p 0 001 and a spearman rank correlation coefficient of 0 914 p 0 001 indicating a high consistency between the two methods 4 2 overview of shifts in activated sludge community structure over time the molecular probe ensembles contained probes for 352 microorganisms in addition to probes for the two competibacteraceae clades plus probes for ten common e coli toxin genes these probes targeted bacterial and archaeal species previously associated with wastewater treatment and for which genome sequences were available in refseq https www ncbi nlm nih gov genome browse overview a full list of microorganisms and probes is given in table s1 supplementary material principal component analysis pca was performed to achieve an overview of the time course profile of the microbiome and to identify samples that deviate from the rest venables and ripley 2002 for the competibacteraceae positive ensemble seven samples from january 2015 to july 2015 were significantly different from the other samples by the first two principal components fig 2 a a molecular probe ensemble that did not contain competibacteraceae probes the competibacteraceae negative ensemble was also employed importantly this customization enabled detection of additional groups with signals masked by the dominant group xu et al 2014 in contrast to the results with the competibacteraceae positive ensemble only two samples december 2013 and august 2015 were detected to be different from the rest by the first two principal components fig 2b these results suggest that the presence of competibacteraceae could mask the detection of less abundant outlier samples 4 3 comparison of microorganisms detected in the activated sludge to identify entities in the activated sludge a statistical method that determines whether a given probe attracts more than the average number of sequencing reads by random sampling was employed materials and methods employing this statistical method microbial and toxin genes were identified in the wastewater microbiome for all samples for comparison purposes across multiple samples it is important to note that the total number of sequencing reads was reasonably constant across all time points fig s2 supplementary material combining the data from all 22 time points the competibacteraceae positive ensemble detected the two competibacteraceae clades at every time point plus eight additional microbial species scattered over several time points no toxin genes were detected fig 3 a for the competibacteraceae negative ensemble a total of 29 microorganisms and three toxin genes were detected but not competibacteraceae fig 3b seven microbial species were detected in both probe ensembles akkermansia muciniphila bifidobacterium adolescentis b longum lactobacillus delbrueckii methanobrevibacter smithii streptococcus salivarius and sebaldella termitidis in all cases the competibacteraceae negative ensemble detected these species at more time points 4 4 pathogen associated probe detection pathogenic organisms were detected with the competibacteraceae negative probe ensemble enterococcus faecium and klebsiella pneumoniae were found in nine and two samples respectively three e coli toxin genes for different types of e coli infection ipah stp and sth were found in six three and two samples respectively the relative concentrations of these toxin genes changed over time interestingly the peak signals of the three toxin genes occurred on the same date december 10 2013 the date with the second most probes detected for these target genes occurred in august 2015 these two dates co occur with the outlier samples in the pca analysis fig 2b when the probes for the three e coli toxin genes are not included in the pca analysis there are no outliers this observation suggests that the toxin genes are the major difference between those outlier samples and the rest 4 5 abundance of species detected it was possible that molecular probe technology detected microorganisms that were present at very low abundance therefore an independent method was employed to detect these microorganisms shotgun metagenomic sequence data had been obtained for three sampling dates brand et al 2019 these data were employed previously for competibacter genome assembly brand et al 2019 herein the data were employed for a community analysis of the 16s rrna genes the data are publicly available under bioproject prjna509633 combining the data from the three time points 757 999 396 100 shotgun sequence reads were collected sequence reads corresponding to 16s rrna genes were extracted using the ssusearch pipeline guo et al 2016 527 410 reads 0 07 were identified as belonging to the 16s rna gene selecting sequence reads representing the v4 region yielded 26 771 sequence reads 5 1 of the 16s rna gene sequence reads or 0 0035 of the total starting sequence reads rarefaction curves for these samples suggested that the full diversity of 16s rrna genes present in the activated sludge was not achieved by this method fig 4 for microbial community analysis the samples were grouped into operational taxonomic units otus based on an open reference approach and clustered at 97 identity rideout et al 2014 all otus were then classified using two taxonomy reference sets greengenes 2012 desantis et al 2006 mcdonald et al 2012 table s2 supplementary material and midas v 2 1 3 table s3 supplementary material the 32 total microbial species detected using molecular probes spanned 24 genera of these 19 genera were identified in the three metagenomic samples based on classification with the midas database and 16 based on classification with the greengenes database an edited version materials and methods of the bacteria identified through the midas database are presented in table 1 of the 21 bacteria listed in table 1 21 were identified by the molecular probe ensemble fig 3 five genera of bacteria were identified by the probe ensemble fig 3 that were not detected within the v4 sequences of 16s rrna table s3 supplementary material alistipes eggerthella klebsiella ochrobactrum and parabacteroides relevant to those bacteria not found by metagenomic sequencing the rarefaction curves fig 4 predict the presence of additional otus these five bacterial genera may be assumed to be present at a concentration too low to be found by the number of metagenomic shotgun sequence reads in addition it should be noted that whereas the sequences of the v4 region of 16s rdnas identified the genus streptococcus the molecular probe ensemble identified streptococcus salivarius and was able to distinguish eight species within the genus of streptococcus table s1 supplementary material 5 discussion 5 1 bacteria in activated sludge of the seven microorganisms detected by both molecular probe ensembles six are commensal organisms that have been found on or within the human body collado et al 2007 eckburg et al 2005 elli et al 2006 hugon et al 2015 kaci et al 2014 turroni et al 2009 and may reflect

fermentation e g b adolescentis b longum l delbrueckii the seventh microorganism s termitidis an inhabitant of insect guts may also persist within an anaerobic digester harmon smith et al 2010 bacteria detected by the competibacteraceae negative probe ensemble included microorganisms that have previously been detected in activated sludge dechloromonas aromatica mcilroy et al 2016 terashima et al 2016 runella slithyformis copeland et al 2012 and alicycliphus denitrificans mechichi et al 2003 combining the data from the two molecular probe ensembles 32 bacterial species were identified since the molecular probe ensemble contained probes for 354 microorganisms that means that 322 microorganisms were not found during an investigation of microorganisms in a given environment it is sometimes as important to determine what is not there as to determine what is there 5 2 minimum detection limit to estimate the minimum detection limit the relative abundance of the genera that the v4 sequences identified at three time points were examined the majority of the microorganisms were present at 0 1 sequence read abundance table s3 supplementary material bacterial genera down to 0 02 e g aquimonas on 7 21 15 and 0 01 e g unassigned novel otu on 7 21 15 were identified adjusting 16s rrna relative abundance for copy number using copyrighter angly et al 2014 did not substantially change these abundances table 1 akkermansia was identified by both v4 sequence and molecular probes at the three time points the relative abundances of akkermansia determined by v4 sequence were 0 00 0 01 and 0 03 analogously sebaldella was identified by both v4 sequence and molecular probes at the three time points the relative abundances of sebaldella determined by v4 sequence were 0 00 0 01 and 0 03 since molecular probe technology identified bacteria that the v4 sequence data did not it may be assumed that the minimum detection limit of the molecular probes in these experiments was less than 0 01 5 3 database considerations there are several public databases that connect genome sequence to bacterial genus thus there is an issue of which database to use in this work the midas database mcilroy et al 2017 2015b was employed to identify 16s rrna sequences because midas has been curated to include genera previously detected in activated sludge and anaerobic digester samples a comparison of the microorganisms identified by the popular greengenes 2012 database desantis et al 2006 mcdonald et al 2012 and the midas database mcilroy et al 2017 2015b yielded more genera detected using the midas database genera that were not detected in the greengenes database may be classified in other genera as one example until 2014 competibacteraceae were considered unclassified gammaproteobacteria in the greengenes 2012 taxonomy competibacteraceae were classified in the sinobacteraceae family the greengenes 2012 database was employed to adjust 16s rrna sequence abundance for copy number variation however a recent study suggests that such adjustment should be reconsidered louca et al 2018 even with midas while the short reads of the v4 region of the 16s rrna gene can be used to identify otus at the genus level species level identification is not possible with any certainty since multiple molecular probes are used per genome species identification can often be achieved reliably 5 4 advantages and disadvantages of molecular probe technology as employed in this work molecular probe technology started with microbial genome sequences therefore truly novel microorganisms could not be detected additionally some genome sequence was required to design the probes however as shown with the competibacter probes a complete and finished genome sequence is not required in recent years the cost of dna sequencing has plummeted the algorithms for assembling individual sequence reads into contigs are robust especially for bacterial dnas where there is only a little repeated sequence new dna sequence can be straightforwardly achieved when needed when sufficient genome sequence becomes available molecular probes can be designed synthesized and added to an existing probe ensemble the principal advantages of molecular probe technology are that hundreds of microorganisms and genes can be interrogated in one tube growth of microorganisms is not required molecular probe ensembles can be customized for example in environments where one or a few bacteria dominate and where it is time consuming and expensive to identify other bacteria present at lower concentrations molecular probe technology works well as seen in the comparison of the results achieved with the two probe ensembles fig 3 omission of probes for any dominant microbial species enables increased detection of microorganisms present at lower concentrations from a starting point of 192 molecular probes interrogating 40 bacteria hyman et al 2010 to 1204 probes interrogating 61 bacteria xu et al 2014 this current work expands the technology to 3356 probes interrogating 355 bacteria 6 conclusions thirty two microorganisms and three toxin genes were identified in activated sludge by employing molecular probe technology the relative concentrations of these entities which were followed for two years changed over time in particular the cpb p15 competibacteraceae clade which appeared to be the major bacterium in the activated sludge fell in concentration for several months before recovering each time point required only one reaction to interrogate hundreds of species of bacteria

depth of sequencing because fewer than 5 of the sequence reads are actually employed in complex systems that require the identification and monitoring of dozens to hundreds of microorganisms molecular probe technology is especially useful molecular probe technology is a robust culture independent and multiplexed means of identifying bacteria present at even low abundances xu et al 2014 a diagram of a molecular probe is shown in fig s1 supplementary material to enable multiplexed detection a probe ensemble can be easily created by mixing probes targeting those bacteria in this study molecular probe technology was applied to study samples of activated sludge taken monthly over a period of 22 months from the secondary treatment system at a wrrf in the san francisco bay area california usa within this plant s secondary system bacteria of the competibacteraceae family are dominant members of the microbial community likely because of the operation of a first stage anaerobic selector followed by pure oxygen aeration brand et al 2019 an ensemble of molecular probes was employed to interrogate two competibacteraceae clades and hundreds of other bacteria monthly over a course of 22 months 2 materials and methods 2 1 raw wastewater to mixed liquor suspended solids mlss weekly grab composite samples of mlss were collected from the secondary treatment system at the wrrf in the san francisco bay area in northern california usa the wrrf treats an average of 63 million gallons of wastewater per day from domestic and industrial sources raw sewage passes through grit removal and primary sedimentation before passing into secondary treatment for organic removal prior to effluent discharge into san francisco bay this process consists of a four stage pure oxygen aeration system where the first stage is operated as an anaerobic selector in addition the wrrf operates an anaerobic digester for biosolids and high strength trucked waste centrate from this digester is combined with the raw influent upstream of primary sedimentation 2 0 ml samples were centrifuged on site the supernatant decanted and the pelleted mlss stored at 20 c until use 2 2 mlss to total dna one hundred μl of 0 01 m tris 0 001 m edta ph8 5 te were added to a freshly thawed sample of mlss the mixture was vortexed to resuspend the mlss the solution was transferred to a 2 ml microtube containing 0 5 mm rnase dnase free glass beads beadruptor omni international 935 c cobb place blvd kennesaw ga 30144 sixty μl of reagent c1 from a powersoil dna isolation kit mobio laboratories inc 12888 100 2746 loker avenue west carlsbad ca 92010 were added the microtube was placed into the beadruptor the mixture was pulsed for 60 s on high ten times the microtube was centrifuged at 10 000 g for 30 s the liquid and the sds foam 400 500 μl total were transferred to a collection tube thereafter the mobio directions were followed to generate sufficient starting material for the molecular probe reactions the mlss dnas were taken through whole genome amplification wga sigma aldrich corp 3050 spruce st st louis mo 63103 2 3 the molecular probe ensemble oligonucleotide probes were designed as described previously xu et al 2014 in brief the aim was to design and synthesize 20 probes for each bacterial genome or gene sequence the molecular probes were 96 mers composed of two domains a 60 base homology sequence known as a homer identical in sequence to the target genome and divided into two 30 base end sections and a common 36 base interior pcr amplification primer domain fig s1 supplemental material the homers were derived from the genome sequences available on the national center for biotechnology information public website refseq https www ncbi nlm nih gov genome browse overview by applying the custom script blaster rb which is freely available at http med stanford edu sgtc research blaster html whenever possible refseq genome sequences were employed because they are well curated the individual probe designs are shown in table s1 supplemental material for this first group of molecular probes 6872 probes targeting 353 bacteria were designed in addition there were three special cases the bacterium nocardia was one special case two nocardia genome sequences were available nc 006361 a refseq genome of nocardia farcinica and bagg01000000 a whole genome shotgun sequencing assembly of nocardia takedensis twenty probes were designed from each nocardia genome sequence the competibacteraceae bacteria were the second special case because these bacteria have not been grown in culture it is not possible to purify competibacteraceae dna starting with a pure culture although two competibacteraceae genomes from metagenomes were available in the database mcilroy et al 2013 the wide genome sequence diversity of this lineage mcilroy et al 2015a warranted probe design based upon the phylotypes present at this wrrf thus bacterial cells were collected from the mlss samples total dna was prepared from the bacterial cells and shotgun sequenced the resulting sequence reads were assembled into groups of contigs brand et al 2019 the sequences from the most secure contigs in the gcf 001051235 assembly were employed to design 53 probes these were synthesized in house jensen et al 2013 of these molecular probes 42 were later shown to match the dominant competibacteraceae cpb p15 genome none matched the competibacteraceae cpb m38 genome seven matched the competibacteraceae cpb c95 genome one probe matched more than one genome sequence and three probes matched unknown targets in total 6954 molecular probes targeting 356 bacterial genomes were designed for the third special case 179 probes targeting 10 e coli toxin genes aggr bfpa eaea east1 ipah lt sth stp stx1 and stx2 were designed with the exception of the competibacteraceae and nocardia probes all other oligonucleotides were purchased from agilent technologies 5301 stevens creek blvd santa clara ca 95051 in total 7133 oligonucleotides potential molecular probes were synthesized with the exception of the competibacteraceae and nocardia probes all oligonucleotides were subjected to recombinase directed indexing redi to isolate sequence verified molecular probe dna which was then converted to 5 phosphorylated single stranded dna as previously described smith et al 2017 because of the limitations of money and time the redi procedure was discontinued after successfully processing 3356 molecular probes thus the final probe ensemble contained 3398 molecular probes representing 355 bacteria plus 10 toxin genes the individual molecular probe designs are given in table s1 supplemental material within the working ensemble each probe was present at a concentration of 25 zmol μl 2 4 the molecular probe reactions the molecular probe reactions have been described in detail hyman et al 2010 2012 xu et al 2014 each wga mlss dna was taken through this procedure for each of the two probe ensembles with and without competibacteraceae probes 2 5 illumina sequencing for each sample successfully hybridized homer sequences were pcr amplified from exonuclease resistant circular dna with primers recognizing the common priming region of the molecular probes fig s1 supplemental material plus adapter sequences for illumina sequencing 2 6 sequence analysis after de multiplexing paired reads were first matched to build consensus reads this step helped to minimize sequencing error next consensus reads were aligned to the 60 base homer sequences using bowtie2 version 2 2 8 employing the very sensitive setting langmead and salzberg 2012 since the 60 base amplicon is formed by a ligation of the two 30 base ends of the molecular probe the requirement of a proper alignment to the 60 base amplicon assured that a successful ligation had taken place thus the amplicon represented a high confidence sampling of the target genome 2 7 presence call of probes and targets for the illumina sequencing data the p values of presence were computed using a negative binomial model robinson and smyth 2007 each probe was assigned a p value of presence measuring whether the number of observed reads was significantly larger than a random assignment of reads to all probes in the probe ensemble the p value was computed by the following formula p x k r 0 n k k r 1 r 1 p r p k where p is the probability that a random probe received a sequence read 1 3398 k is the number of reads observed and n is the total number of reads mapped a probe with a p value of less than 0 05 was considered positive a bacterium or a target sequence was considered to be present if it had more than a total of five designated probes and at least three of them were positive or if it had fewer than five probes and at least two of them were positive xu et al 2014 as a caution the call of present or absent might be confounded by the unknown affinity of the probe for its target a high affinity probe that attracts more than the average number of sequencing reads would be called positive a low affinity probe that attracts fewer than the average number of sequencing reads would be called negative 2 8 statistical analysis statistical analyses for probe detection were carried out in r2 15 2 plots were generated either in r2 15 2 or microsoft excel 2016 specifically the pheatmap package was applied to draw heatmaps for bacteria detected more than once over the time course using normalized and log2 transformed probe level signal counts per million 2 9 correlation to qpcr a qpcr assay for the competibacteraceae clades present at the wrrf has been described brand et al 2019 the trend for the cpb p15 clade found using the qpcr assay brand et al 2019 was compared to that found with molecular probes for the seventeen sampling dates from may 2014 to october 2015 the data for the qpcr assays in fig 1 were abstracted from brand et al 2019 the analyses used samples that were biological replicates although processed starting with different disruption instruments 3 identification of 16s rrna from shotgun metagenomic sequences dna was sequenced by genewiz south plainfield nj using the illumina hiseq x ten platform to produce 2 x 150 base paired end reads all reads were quality trimmed using the clc genomics workbench v8 0 3 clcbio qiagen with default conditions and removing adapters reads were also merged using this same program all quality trimmed reads were exported in fasta format and processed employing the ssusearch pipeline guo et al 2016 through the alignment and identification of 16s rdna reads mapping to the v4 region individual sample files were then concatenated and imported into qiime caporaso et al 2010 for open reference otu picking rideout et al 2014 against the midas database v 2 1 3 mcilroy et al 2017 2015b reads were clustered at 97 similarity using the sumaclust kopylova et al 2016 and sortmerna kopylova et al 2012 option for pick open reference otu py 3 1 microbial community visualization otu tables were imported into the r environment v 3 4 4 in the r studio ide http www rstudio com using the ampvis2 package andersen et al 2018 to produce heatmap visualizations of the microbial community to construct table 1 from the total table s3 supplementary material bacteria such as propioniciclava and fodinibacter for which there are no genome sequences in refseq and therefore for which no molecular probes could be designed were excluded entities such as novel otu1 and gks98 freshwater group which also have no corresponding genome sequences in refseq were also excluded lastly bacteria such as tetrasphaera and mycobacterium that have refseq genome sequences but were not represented by probes in our ensemble were also excluded probes for these bacteria can be added to the ensemble at any time 4 results 4 1 validation of molecular probes as a monitoring tool for bacteria in activated sludge employing molecular probe technology the relative concentration of competibacteraceae clade cpb p15 was interrogated as a function of time these results were compared to the results obtained with qpcr brand et al 2019 twenty two monthly samples of mixed liquor suspended solids from the secondary system were investigated seventeen of these samples were biological replicates taken on the sampling dates for qpcr brand et al 2019 the competibacteraceae positive ensemble detected the cpb p15 genome at all 22 time points consistent with the qpcr results fig 1 both sets of results show that the signal for cpb p15 was reasonably constant over the first 10 months of 2014 in the last quarter of 2014 the signal began to drop and reached its lowest value in january 2015 before increasing again comparing the trends observed in the molecular probes analysis to those obtained by qpcr across the 17 samples yielded a pearson correlation coefficient of 0 826 p 0 001 and a spearman rank correlation coefficient of 0 914 p 0 001 indicating a high consistency between the two methods 4 2 overview of shifts in activated sludge community structure over time the molecular probe ensembles contained probes for 352 microorganisms in addition to probes for the two competibacteraceae clades plus probes for ten common e coli toxin genes these probes targeted bacterial and archaeal species previously associated with wastewater treatment and for which genome sequences were available in refseq https www ncbi nlm nih gov genome browse overview a full list of microorganisms and probes is given in table s1 supplementary material principal component analysis pca was performed to achieve an overview of the time course profile of the microbiome and to identify samples that deviate from the rest venables and ripley 2002 for the competibacteraceae positive ensemble seven samples from january 2015 to july 2015 were significantly different from the other samples by the first two principal components fig 2 a a molecular probe ensemble that did not contain competibacteraceae probes the competibacteraceae negative ensemble was also employed importantly this customization enabled detection of additional groups with signals masked by the dominant group xu et al 2014 in contrast to the results with the competibacteraceae positive ensemble only two samples december 2013 and august 2015 were detected to be different from the rest by the first two principal components fig 2b these results suggest that the presence of competibacteraceae could mask the detection of less abundant outlier samples 4 3 comparison of microorganisms detected in the activated sludge to identify entities in the activated sludge a statistical method that determines whether a given probe attracts more than the average number of sequencing reads by random sampling was employed materials and methods employing this statistical method microbial and toxin genes were identified in the wastewater microbiome for all samples for comparison purposes across multiple samples it is important to note that the total number of sequencing reads was reasonably constant across all time points fig s2 supplementary material combining the data from all 22 time points the competibacteraceae positive ensemble detected the two competibacteraceae clades at every time point plus eight additional microbial species scattered over several time points no toxin genes were detected fig 3 a for the competibacteraceae negative ensemble a total of 29 microorganisms and three toxin genes were detected but not competibacteraceae fig 3b seven microbial species were detected in both probe ensembles akkermansia muciniphila bifidobacterium adolescentis b longum lactobacillus delbrueckii methanobrevibacter smithii streptococcus salivarius and sebaldella termitidis in all cases the competibacteraceae negative ensemble detected these species at more time points 4 4 pathogen associated probe detection pathogenic organisms were detected with the competibacteraceae negative probe ensemble enterococcus faecium and klebsiella pneumoniae were found in nine and two samples respectively three e coli toxin genes for different types of e coli infection ipah stp and sth were found in six three and two samples respectively the relative concentrations of these toxin genes changed over time interestingly the peak signals of the three toxin genes occurred on the same date december 10 2013 the date with the second most probes detected for these target genes occurred in august 2015 these two dates co occur with the outlier samples in the pca analysis fig 2b when the probes for the three e coli toxin genes are not included in the pca analysis there are no outliers this observation suggests that the toxin genes are the major difference between those outlier samples and the rest 4 5 abundance of species detected it was possible that molecular probe technology detected microorganisms that were present at very low abundance therefore an independent method was employed to detect these microorganisms shotgun metagenomic sequence data had been obtained for three sampling dates brand et al 2019 these data were employed previously for competibacter genome assembly brand et al 2019 herein the data were employed for a community analysis of the 16s rrna genes the data are publicly available under bioproject prjna509633 combining the data from the three time points 757 999 396 100 shotgun sequence reads were collected sequence reads corresponding to 16s rrna genes were extracted using the ssusearch pipeline guo et al 2016 527 410 reads 0 07 were identified as belonging to the 16s rna gene selecting sequence reads representing the v4 region yielded 26 771 sequence reads 5 1 of the 16s rna gene sequence reads or 0 0035 of the total starting sequence reads rarefaction curves for these samples suggested that the full diversity of 16s rrna genes present in the activated sludge was not achieved by this method fig 4 for microbial community analysis the samples were grouped into operational taxonomic units otus based on an open reference approach and clustered at 97 identity rideout et al 2014 all otus were then classified using two taxonomy reference sets greengenes 2012 desantis et al 2006 mcdonald et al 2012 table s2 supplementary material and midas v 2 1 3 table s3 supplementary material the 32 total microbial species detected using molecular probes spanned 24 genera of these 19 genera were identified in the three metagenomic samples based on classification with the midas database and 16 based on classification with the greengenes database an edited version materials and methods of the bacteria identified through the midas database are presented in table 1 of the 21 bacteria listed in table 1 21 were identified by the molecular probe ensemble fig 3 five genera of bacteria were identified by the probe ensemble fig 3 that were not detected within the v4 sequences of 16s rrna table s3 supplementary material alistipes eggerthella klebsiella ochrobactrum and parabacteroides relevant to those bacteria not found by metagenomic sequencing the rarefaction curves fig 4 predict the presence of additional otus these five bacterial genera may be assumed to be present at a concentration too low to be found by the number of metagenomic shotgun sequence reads in addition it should be noted that whereas the sequences of the v4 region of 16s rdnas identified the genus streptococcus the molecular probe ensemble identified streptococcus salivarius and was able to distinguish eight species within the genus of streptococcus table s1 supplementary material 5 discussion 5 1 bacteria in activated sludge of the seven microorganisms detected by both molecular probe ensembles six are commensal organisms that have been found on or within the human body collado et al 2007 eckburg et al 2005 elli et al 2006 hugon et al 2015 kaci et al 2014 turroni et al 2009 and may reflect

fermentation e g b adolescentis b longum l delbrueckii the seventh microorganism s termitidis an inhabitant of insect guts may also persist within an anaerobic digester harmon smith et al 2010 bacteria detected by the competibacteraceae negative probe ensemble included microorganisms that have previously been detected in activated sludge dechloromonas aromatica mcilroy et al 2016 terashima et al 2016 runella slithyformis copeland et al 2012 and alicycliphus denitrificans mechichi et al 2003 combining the data from the two molecular probe ensembles 32 bacterial species were identified since the molecular probe ensemble contained probes for 354 microorganisms that means that 322 microorganisms were not found during an investigation of microorganisms in a given environment it is sometimes as important to determine what is not there as to determine what is there 5 2 minimum detection limit to estimate the minimum detection limit the relative abundance of the genera that the v4 sequences identified at three time points were examined the majority of the microorganisms were present at 0 1 sequence read abundance table s3 supplementary material bacterial genera down to 0 02 e g aquimonas on 7 21 15 and 0 01 e g unassigned novel otu on 7 21 15 were identified adjusting 16s rrna relative abundance for copy number using copyrighter angly et al 2014 did not substantially change these abundances table 1 akkermansia was identified by both v4 sequence and molecular probes at the three time points the relative abundances of akkermansia determined by v4 sequence were 0 00 0 01 and 0 03 analogously sebaldella was identified by both v4 sequence and molecular probes at the three time points the relative abundances of sebaldella determined by v4 sequence were 0 00 0 01 and 0 03 since molecular probe technology identified bacteria that the v4 sequence data did not it may be assumed that the minimum detection limit of the molecular probes in these experiments was less than 0 01 5 3 database considerations there are several public databases that connect genome sequence to bacterial genus thus there is an issue of which database to use in this work the midas database mcilroy et al 2017 2015b was employed to identify 16s rrna sequences because midas has been curated to include genera previously detected in activated sludge and anaerobic digester samples a comparison of the microorganisms identified by the popular greengenes 2012 database desantis et al 2006 mcdonald et al 2012 and the midas database mcilroy et al 2017 2015b yielded more genera detected using the midas database genera that were not detected in the greengenes database may be classified in other genera as one example until 2014 competibacteraceae were considered unclassified gammaproteobacteria in the greengenes 2012 taxonomy competibacteraceae were classified in the sinobacteraceae family the greengenes 2012 database was employed to adjust 16s rrna sequence abundance for copy number variation however a recent study suggests that such adjustment should be reconsidered louca et al 2018 even with midas while the short reads of the v4 region of the 16s rrna gene can be used to identify otus at the genus level species level identification is not possible with any certainty since multiple molecular probes are used per genome species identification can often be achieved reliably 5 4 advantages and disadvantages of molecular probe technology as employed in this work molecular probe technology started with microbial genome sequences therefore truly novel microorganisms could not be detected additionally some genome sequence was required to design the probes however as shown with the competibacter probes a complete and finished genome sequence is not required in recent years the cost of dna sequencing has plummeted the algorithms for assembling individual sequence reads into contigs are robust especially for bacterial dnas where there is only a little repeated sequence new dna sequence can be straightforwardly achieved when needed when sufficient genome sequence becomes available molecular probes can be designed synthesized and added to an existing probe ensemble the principal advantages of molecular probe technology are that hundreds of microorganisms and genes can be interrogated in one tube growth of microorganisms is not required molecular probe ensembles can be customized for example in environments where one or a few bacteria dominate and where it is time consuming and expensive to identify other bacteria present at lower concentrations molecular probe technology works well as seen in the comparison of the results achieved with the two probe ensembles fig 3 omission of probes for any dominant microbial species enables increased detection of microorganisms present at lower concentrations from a starting point of 192 molecular probes interrogating 40 bacteria hyman et al 2010 to 1204 probes interrogating 61 bacteria xu et al 2014 this current work expands the technology to 3356 probes interrogating 355 bacteria 6 conclusions thirty two microorganisms and three toxin genes were identified in activated sludge by employing molecular probe technology the relative concentrations of these entities which were followed for two years changed over time in particular the cpb p15 competibacteraceae clade which appeared to be the major bacterium in the activated sludge fell in concentration for several months before recovering each time point required only one reaction to interrogate hundreds of species of bacteria

18417,the san joaquin river sjr in california is purported to receive high nitrate loadings from surrounding agricultural lands through both surface and groundwater inputs to investigate the potential removal of nitrate no3 from surface and ground water sources the spatial variations in dinitrogen n2 gas concentrations and direct measurements of sediment denitrification potential dnp with amended no3 and carbon c treatments were investigated in the summer along a 95 km reach of the san joaquin river excess n2 in hyporheic porewaters ranged from 0 1 to 8 65 mg l 1 and was significantly higher in porewaters from the 1 3 m ground water source versus 0 3 m mixed surface and ground water depths in deep groundwater wells 3 7 m median excess n2 concentration was 5 39 mg l 1 range 0 1 14 6 mg l 1 excess n2 concentrations were inversely correlated with dissolved oxygen and no3 concentrations suggesting denitrification as an important process in the dominantly anaerobic sediments hyporheic porewater no3 concentrations exceeded the detection limit of 0 01 mg l 1 in only 20 of the hyporheic porewaters in spite of high no3 concentrations measured in both surface waters mean 2 25 mg n l 1 and surrounding groundwaters sediment dnp rates averaged 253 and 297 μg n kg 1 hr 1 for no3 amended and no3 c amended sediments respectively supporting the prevalence of denitrification in hyporheic sediments our results indicate that the hyporheic riparian zones act as an anoxic barrier to nitrate transport from regional groundwater and as a location to remove no3 from surface waters exchanging with the hyporheic zone graphical abstract image 1 keywords nitrate membrane inlet mass spectrometer groundwater hyporheic zone 1 introduction anthropogenic acceleration of global nitrogen n fixation has led to elevated nitrate no3 concentrations in surface and ground waters worldwide leading to severe aquatic ecosystem degradation and drinking water impairment townsend et al 2003 galloway et al 2004 kulkarni et al 2008 schullehner et al 2018 riparian buffer zones and the hyporheic zone where surface and ground waters interact with stream sediments are recognized as important zones regulating water quality especially the fate and transport of inorganic n forms muholland et al 2008 nutrients oxygen and microbially labile carbon sources interact within riparian and hyporheic zone sediments creating intermixed oxic and anoxic groundwater and porewaters respectively that fuel a wide range of coupled biogeochemical transformations such as denitrification nitrification and anaerobic mineralization the hyporheic and riparian zones predominantly act as a sink for no3 by denitrification when no3 rich surface water mixes with oxygen depleted and carbon rich sediments and groundwater hill et al 2000 seitzinger et al 2006 denitrification reduces no3 to dinitrogen n2 with nitrite no2 nitric oxide no and nitrous oxide n2o as intermediate products knowles 1982 denitrification from large rivers and lakes is an important process in the global n budget as it is estimated to account for up to 20 of total global denitrification seitzinger et al 2006 many studies have demonstrated the importance of hyporheic zone denitrification as an important sink for reactive n attenuating n pollution s negative impacts seitzinger 1988 kulkarni et al 2008 merill and tonjes 2014 alternative n removal pathways exist in anaerobic environments such as chemolithotrophic denitrification anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox and dissimilatory reduction of no3 to ammonium nh4 dnra kartal et al 2007 marchant et al 2016 roland et al 2018 dnra does not remove n from the system but rather transforms no3 to nh4 whereas anammox reduces nh4 and no2 to n2 resulting in the loss of n from the system strous et al 1999 burgin and hamilton 2007 smith et al 2015 found that anammox contributed 39 90 of n2 production in groundwater and effectively removed n for hyporheic and riparian zone nitrate removal via denitrification the controlling environmental factors are microbial populations river discharge rates residence time organic carbon and no3 supply sediment permeability dissolved oxygen do temperature ph streambed sediments and nutrient and oxygen exchange rates o connor and hondzo 2008 allen et al 2007 ishida et al 2008 james et al 2008 in agricultural landscapes numerous studies show that removal of n from groundwater and surface water at the terrestrial aquatic interface and the sediment water interface is enhanced by the presence of abundant electron donors namely organic carbon and sufficient residence times to allow for microbial processing puckett et al 2008 zarnetske et al 2011 harvey et al 2013 the san joaquin river valley in california is one of the most intensively utilized regions in the world for irrigated agriculture receiving high n inputs from fertilizers agricultural drainage livestock operations atmospheric deposition urban wastewater and stormwater discharge resulting in a history of surface and groundwater contamination burow et al 1998 kratzer et al 2004 tomich et al 2016 surface water no3 concentrations in the lower portion of the sjr generally range between 1 and 4 mg n l 1 and contribute to eutrophication and seasonally hypoxic conditions in portions of the lower river kratzer et al 2004 groundwater no3 concentrations are elevated throughout much of the sjr valley often exceeding the drinking water standard of 10 mg n l 1 harter et al 2017 given the high no3 concentrations found in the surrounding groundwaters of the lower srj valley it was inferred that no3 loads from groundwater sources could contribute appreciably to surface water no3 thus distinguishing groundwater n contributions to surface waters and understanding the relative importance of groundwater surface water interactions in controlling no3 transport are important for developing basin wide agricultural water quality management plans to reduce nutrient loads in the lower sjr nitrogen dynamics in streams and rivers are not well understood in part because it is difficult to measure dynamic n removal processes across time and space groffman et al 2006 the intent of this study is not to distinguish between n removal pathways but rather to use excess n2 an end product of several major n removal pathways as an indicator of reactive n removal at the landscape scale we use a combination of membrane inlet mass spectrometer mims derived n2 supersaturation estimates and potential denitrification assays acetylene inhibition technique from hyporheic sediments to assess removal of nitrate as well as the factors limiting this removal measurements of n2 using mims technology allow for quantification of net n2 accumulation independent of the metabolic pathway and represent an integration of all n biogeochemical processes taking place along the groundwater flowpath kana et al 1994 blicher mathiesen et al 1998 weymann et al 2008 the use of the acetylene inhibition technique allows for measurements of potential rates and manipulations of sediments to assess controlling factors in this study we i investigated spatial variability in excess n2 within hyporheic zone porewaters and groundwater wells along a 95 km reach of the lower sjr ii assessed the relationship between nitrate concentrations and other physio chemical characteristics on excess n2 concentrations and iii examined the denitrification potential of hyporheic sediments via acetylene inhibition along the lower sjr in so doing we provide some of the first estimates of the importance of n removal in surface and groundwaters of the sjr and provide an example of how such an approach can be used to understand landscape scale n removal distribution and dynamics 2 material and methods 2 1 overview in order to enhance understanding of the spatial distribution of n removal in the sjr we measured n2 ar ratios in 168 hyporheic zone porewater samples 0 31 1 82 m depth from 28 sites over a 95 km reach during summer low flow conditions sampling in other seasons was not possible due to high flow these samples were augmented with groundwater samples from three locations with nested wells ranging in depth from 3 to 7 m results from the n2 ar experiment warranted further investigation into sources of n2 therefore an acetylene inhibition experiment was conducted the following year to establish what factors were likely limiting denitrification and to estimate potential denitrification rates using hyporheic sediments from six sites table s1 provides a summary of sampling and analytical approaches 2 2 study sites this study was conducted along a 95 km section of the lower san joaquin river california between the confluence of salt slough river km

of sjr over a distance of 95 km the use of dissolved n2 ar ratios allowed us to assess the cumulative amount of excess n2 occurring within porewater and adjacent groundwater wells excess n2 concentrations in the sjr were greater than those reported from other agriculturally impacted rivers range 0 01 0 47 mg n l 1 yan et al 2012 changjiang river range 0 04 0 48 mg n l 1 chen et al 2014 jiulong river and agricultural groundwater mean range 0 00 3 22 mg n l 1 fenton et al 2011 dairy farm ireland mean range 0 00 3 30 mg n l 1 mcaleer et al 2017 agricultural catchments ireland based on excess n2 concentrations the mean loss of no3 to n2 was 68 along the 95 km section of the lower sjr assuming the common respiratory denitrification pathway dominated n2 production the fraction of n2 loss from din no3 nh4 no2 was somewhat lower at 46 however this is higher than several previous studies from rivers surrounded by agricultural land such as smith et al 2006 range 2 17 and chen et al 2014 mean range 8 66 have reported excess n2 within hyporheic porewaters showed a general pattern of increasing concentrations at downstream sites lower excess n2 concentrations upstream of the merced river confluence 118 5 km possibly reflect differences in land use land cover above the confluence the predominant river adjacent land uses are wetlands and grasslands below the confluence agricultural activity increases on both the east and west sides of the river thus we ascribe the general trend for increasing excess n2 concentrations at downstream locations to a generally increasing pattern of nitrate leaching from agricultural intensification kratzer et al 2011 while mean excess n2 showed a tendency to increase from the east to west side of the channel the high variability within the stream cross section rendered these differences weakly significant p 0 048 finer particle size of sediments along the west side likely hinders the diffusion of oxygen creating greater oxygen depletion and increased residence time both of which can enhance denitrification harvey et al 2013 this premise was supported by the percent loss of no3 to excess n2 as this percentage significantly p 0 001 increased from east to west mean 48 1 68 1 and 84 1 for east middle and west bank positions respectively a previous study of no3 rich seepage waters in west side soils sediments adjacent to the sjr showed rapid development of anoxic conditions and high rates of no3 removal by denitrification in constructed wetlands brauer et al 2015 complicating the east versus west side comparison is the historical meandering of the river channel has resulted in a complex mixing of aquifer materials in the vicinity of the current river channel excess n2 was greater at the 1 82 m depth compared to 0 31 m at most sites potentially indicating a vertical gradient where n2 was diluted by hyporheic zone mixing of surface and ground waters jones and mulholland 2000 the negative relationship between o2 and excess n2 in addition to significantly lower o2 concentrations at the deeper depth supports the findings of several previous studies indicating denitrification in anaerobic conditions hill et al 2000 fenton et al 2011 chen et al 2014 the negative relationship between temperature and n2 is reflective of the deeper depth being up to 4 c cooler than the shallow depth which also suggests that the deeper waters were sourced from deeper regional groundwater zamora et al 2012 this pattern further suggests that the shallow porewater is a combination of warmer surface waters mixing with cooler groundwater in the hyporheic zone thus the vertical spatial differences in excess n2 likely reflect water source e g deep groundwater vs mixing of surface and ground waters in hyporheic zone rather than inherent differences in in situ denitrification rates between the two depths models of surface water groundwater interactions in the study area estimated that only about 10 of the surface waters during the summer low flow season originates from groundwater inputs making groundwater a minor hydrologic source of surface waters overall zamora et al 2012 hence these findings support the suggestion above that the two depths represent different water sources mixing of surface and ground waters at the 0 31 m depth is further supported by the higher sc values ms cm 1 at 1 82 m mean 2 96 0 25 versus 0 31 m mean 2 43 0 18 which suggest dilution of sc in the 0 31 m samples by surface waters that had a median sc of 0 98 ms cm 1 table s2 this would also suggest potential dilution and or degassing of dissolved n2 at the 0 31 m depth additionally the negative correlation between excess n2 in shallow but not deeper porewaters and no3 in surface waters r 0 41 p 0 001 supports the mixing of surface water shallow porewater while deeper hyporheic porewaters most likely originate from groundwater high spatial and temporal variability hot spots hot moments commonly associated with denitrification processes was reflected at all spatial scales in this study bernard jannin et al 2017 rivers often switch between a nitrate sink and source due to upwelling of groundwater or downwelling of surface water within the hyporheic zone li et al 2017 in this study variability in excess n2 was primarily associated with variations in no3 and dissolved oxygen as depicted by the negative relationship between no3 and excess n2 when no3 concentrations were 0 1 mg n l 1 fig 4 this negative relationship was also found in the permanent groundwater wells screened between 3 7 m and in a previous study hinshaw and dahlgren 2016 this negative relationship is consistent with a dominant role for denitrification in consuming no3 and producing excess n2 gas site 154 5 km was of particular interest given its high no3 concentrations 10 2 1 1 mg n l 1 and low excess n2 1 mg n l this site is located just downstream of a wastewater treatment plant tertiary treatment located on the east bank during the growing season march june the majority of its treated effluent is disposed of as irrigation water for pastures that occur within 1 km of the river thus large volumes of no3 rich waters are added to the land surface which presumably introduces localized no3 rich groundwater having a relatively short residence time before emerging as surface waters in the sjr deep monitoring wells 13 2 16 8 m within and surrounding the irrigated pasture were measured in the same manner as the riparian groundwater wells the mean no3 concentration was 6 1 mg n l 1 range 0 01 23 8 and mean excess n2 concentrations was 4 6 mg n l 1 range 1 35 8 92 mg n l 1 table s4 therefore these deeper groundwaters do not appear to be the primary source of the hyporheic porewaters given their higher levels of excess n2 and generally lower no3 concentrations rather we posit that a shallow groundwater flow path having insufficient residence time to allow for appreciable denitrification is the primary source of the hyporheic porewaters at site 154 5 km estimated groundwater flow rates of 0 03 0 12 m3 s 1 for the lower sjr could support a wide range of groundwater residence times zamora et al 2012 therefore for this specific section of the sjr higher flow rate lower residence time flowpaths may prevent the onset of anoxic conditions hindering denitrification and no3 consumption assuming sufficiently anaerobic conditions to support denitrification or other mechanisms of n removal occurring under anaerobic conditions such as anammox or dnra groundwater sources will accumulate excess n2 concentrations along the groundwater flowpath until either no3 or doc is depleted which was supported by the mean concentration of excess n2 in groundwater wells 7 18 0 48 being nearly five times greater compared to the overall mean of excess n2 concentrations within hyporheic porewaters 1 48 0 14 trauth et al 2014 found that groundwater flow had a greater influence over denitrification rates than stream discharge and emphasized the importance of accounting for groundwater inputs into the hyporheic zone 4 2 denitrification potential rates denitrification potential rates were measured in the year following the longitudinal study to verify if denitrification was a prevalent process within hyporheic porewaters out of the 144 dnp incubations 86 demonstrated denitrifying activity despite oxygenated mixing of surface water within the hyporheic zone nitrification was considered negligible due to low or undetectable nh4 within sjr surface waters hinshaw and dahlgren 2013 dnp rates displayed high spatial variability within sites among sites and between seasons april vs september as is often found in such studies dnp rates were greater than those compared to a study in agriculturally impacted lakes liu et al 2015 and those found in natural and forested wetlands gardner and white 2010 harrison et al 2011 genthner et al 2013 the similarity between dnp rates in the no3 c amendments and no3 originally suggests no appreciable carbon limitation for denitrifiers in spite of the rather low total carbon concentrations 0 08 0 63 this is consistent with several similar studies that found that no3 and not organic carbon limited sediment denitrification esteves et al 2001 wall et al 2005 however in this study stepwise regression suggested a positive contribution from oxc owing to this fraction being most available for bacterial metabolism the role of oxc is also supported by the data from site 173 5 km which had the highest oxc concentrations west and the corresponding highest dnp rates when no3 concentrations are high concentrations of oxc become more crucial for attenuating no3 by stimulating denitrification activity and driving complete nitrate reduction to n2 firestone et al 1980 similar results have been found in low carbon and elevated no3 stream and river sediments bernhardt and likens 2002 inwood et al 2007 findlay et al 2011 further xu et al 2015 concluded that high organic matter is necessary to sustain low no3 concentrations via denitrification in agricultural groundwater the relationship of higher dnp rates with lower psd has been found in several previous studies pinay et al 2000 opdyke and david 2007 welsh et al 2017 similar to this study d haene et al 2003 found denitrification rates were highest in clay soil and lowest in sandy soils fine textured sediments such as clay and silt often harbor higher concentrations of carbon lower oxygen concentrations and more suitable attachment sites for bacteria attenuating their downstream advection iribar et al 2008 identified denitrifying bacteria communities attached to aquifer sediment that exhibited higher denitrification enzyme activity the significantly higher dnp rates in no3 and no3 c treatments from the east to west bank is consistent with the finer textured sediments resulting from the contrasting sediment sources table 2 5 conclusions the predominantly elevated excess n2 concentrations and overall low no3 concentrations mean 0 91 mg n l 1 in deeper porewaters suggest that the sjr riparian and hyporheic zones act as an effective anoxic barrier to no3 transport from regional groundwaters to surface water sites with low or negligible n2 tended to have high concentrations of no3 and do along with low doc indicating inhibition of denitrification dnp rates confirmed the prevalence of high denitrification capacity within hyporheic sediments of the sjr oxidizable c fraction was the key factor limiting dnp rates highlighting the importance of microbially labile c in fueling denitrification this study suggests that riparian and hyporheic zone management and restoration activities that focus on increasing inputs of carbon and water transport residence times provide an opportunity for enhancing denitrification in hydrologic systems subject to high no3 loading declaration of competing interest the

18417,the san joaquin river sjr in california is purported to receive high nitrate loadings from surrounding agricultural lands through both surface and groundwater inputs to investigate the potential removal of nitrate no3 from surface and ground water sources the spatial variations in dinitrogen n2 gas concentrations and direct measurements of sediment denitrification potential dnp with amended no3 and carbon c treatments were investigated in the summer along a 95 km reach of the san joaquin river excess n2 in hyporheic porewaters ranged from 0 1 to 8 65 mg l 1 and was significantly higher

strous et al 1999 burgin and hamilton 2007 smith et al 2015 found that anammox contributed 39 90 of n2 production in groundwater and effectively removed n for hyporheic and riparian zone nitrate removal via denitrification the controlling environmental factors are microbial populations river discharge rates residence time organic carbon and no3 supply sediment permeability dissolved oxygen do temperature ph streambed sediments and nutrient and oxygen exchange rates o connor and hondzo 2008 allen et al 2007 ishida et al 2008 james et al 2008 in agricultural landscapes numerous studies show that removal of n from groundwater and surface water at the terrestrial aquatic interface and the sediment water interface is enhanced by the presence of abundant electron donors namely organic carbon and sufficient residence times to allow for microbial processing puckett et al 2008 zarnetske et al 2011 harvey et al 2013 the san joaquin river valley in california is one of the most intensively utilized regions in the world for irrigated agriculture receiving high n inputs from fertilizers agricultural drainage livestock operations atmospheric deposition urban wastewater and stormwater discharge resulting in a history of surface and groundwater contamination burow et al 1998 kratzer et al 2004 tomich et al 2016 surface water no3 concentrations in the lower portion of the sjr generally range between 1 and 4 mg n l 1 and contribute to eutrophication and seasonally hypoxic conditions in portions of the lower river kratzer et al 2004 groundwater no3 concentrations are elevated throughout much of the sjr valley often exceeding the drinking water standard of 10 mg n l 1 harter et al 2017 given the high no3 concentrations found in the surrounding groundwaters of the lower srj valley it was inferred that no3 loads from groundwater sources could contribute appreciably to surface water no3 thus distinguishing groundwater n contributions to surface waters and understanding the relative importance of groundwater surface water interactions in controlling no3 transport are important for developing basin wide agricultural water quality management plans to reduce nutrient loads in the lower sjr nitrogen dynamics in streams and rivers are not well understood in part because it is difficult to measure dynamic n removal processes across time and space groffman et al 2006 the intent of this study is not to distinguish between n removal pathways but rather to use excess n2 an end product of several major n removal pathways as an indicator of reactive n removal at the landscape scale we use a combination of membrane inlet mass spectrometer mims derived n2 supersaturation estimates and potential denitrification assays acetylene inhibition technique from hyporheic sediments to assess removal of nitrate as well as the factors limiting this removal measurements of n2 using mims technology allow for quantification of net n2 accumulation independent of the metabolic pathway and represent an integration of all n biogeochemical processes taking place along the groundwater flowpath kana et al 1994 blicher mathiesen et al 1998 weymann et al 2008 the use of the acetylene inhibition technique allows for measurements of potential rates and manipulations of sediments to assess controlling factors in this study we i investigated spatial variability in excess n2 within hyporheic zone porewaters and groundwater wells along a 95 km reach of the lower sjr ii assessed the relationship between nitrate concentrations and other physio chemical characteristics on excess n2 concentrations and iii examined the denitrification potential of hyporheic sediments via acetylene inhibition along the lower sjr in so doing we provide some of the first estimates of the importance of n removal in surface and groundwaters of the sjr and provide an example of how such an approach can be used to understand landscape scale n removal distribution and dynamics 2 material and methods 2 1 overview in order to enhance understanding of the spatial distribution of n removal in the sjr we measured n2 ar ratios in 168 hyporheic zone porewater samples 0 31 1 82 m depth from 28 sites over a 95 km reach during summer low flow conditions sampling in other seasons was not possible due to high flow these samples were augmented with groundwater samples from three locations with nested wells ranging in depth from 3 to 7 m results from the n2 ar experiment warranted further investigation into sources of n2 therefore an acetylene inhibition experiment was conducted the following year to establish what factors were likely limiting denitrification and to estimate potential denitrification rates using hyporheic sediments from six sites table s1 provides a summary of sampling and analytical approaches 2 2 study sites this study was conducted along a 95 km section of the lower san joaquin river california between the confluence of salt slough river km

groundwater samples for dissolved n2 ar and general water chemistry were collected in the same manner as described above for porewaters 2 4 dissolved n2 ar gas analysis dissolved gas samples collected from hyporheic porewaters and groundwater were analyzed with a membrane inlet mass spectrometer mims kana et al 1994 and analyzed using solubility constants of weiss and price 1980 prior to analysis porewater samples were brought to room temperature in a water bath to equilibrate the dissolved gases and eliminate any air bubbles formed during refrigeration and storage five pseudo replicated

of sjr over a distance of 95 km the use of dissolved n2 ar ratios allowed us to assess the cumulative amount of excess n2 occurring within porewater and adjacent groundwater wells excess n2 concentrations in the sjr were greater than those reported from other agriculturally impacted rivers range 0 01 0 47 mg n l 1 yan et al 2012 changjiang river range 0 04 0 48 mg n l 1 chen et al 2014 jiulong river and agricultural groundwater mean range 0 00 3 22 mg n l 1 fenton et al 2011 dairy farm ireland mean range 0 00 3 30 mg n l 1 mcaleer et al 2017 agricultural catchments ireland based on excess n2 concentrations the mean loss of no3 to n2 was 68 along the 95 km section of the lower sjr assuming the common respiratory denitrification pathway dominated n2 production the fraction of n2 loss from din no3 nh4 no2 was somewhat lower at 46 however this is higher than several previous studies from rivers surrounded by agricultural land such as smith et al 2006 range 2 17 and chen et al 2014 mean range 8 66 have reported excess n2 within hyporheic porewaters showed a general pattern of increasing concentrations at downstream sites lower excess n2 concentrations upstream of the merced river confluence 118 5 km possibly reflect differences in land use land cover above the confluence the predominant river adjacent land uses are wetlands and grasslands below the confluence agricultural activity increases on both the east and west sides of the river thus we ascribe the general trend for increasing excess n2 concentrations at downstream locations to a generally increasing pattern of nitrate leaching from agricultural intensification kratzer et al 2011 while mean excess n2 showed a tendency to increase from the east to west side of the channel the high variability within the stream cross section rendered these differences weakly significant p 0 048 finer particle size of sediments along the west side likely hinders the diffusion of oxygen creating greater oxygen depletion and increased residence time both of which can enhance denitrification harvey et al 2013 this premise was supported by the percent loss of no3 to excess n2 as this percentage significantly p 0 001 increased from east to west mean 48 1 68 1 and 84 1 for east middle and west bank positions respectively a previous study of no3 rich seepage waters in west side soils sediments adjacent to the sjr showed rapid development of anoxic conditions and high rates of no3 removal by denitrification in constructed wetlands brauer et al 2015 complicating the east versus west side comparison is the historical meandering of the river channel has resulted in a complex mixing of aquifer materials in the vicinity of the current river channel excess n2 was greater at the 1 82 m depth compared to 0 31 m at most sites potentially indicating a vertical gradient where n2 was diluted by hyporheic zone mixing of surface and ground waters jones and mulholland 2000 the negative relationship between o2 and excess n2 in addition to significantly lower o2 concentrations at the deeper depth supports the findings of several previous studies indicating denitrification in anaerobic conditions hill et al 2000 fenton et al 2011 chen et al 2014 the negative relationship between temperature and n2 is reflective of the deeper depth being up to 4 c cooler than the shallow depth which also suggests that the deeper waters were sourced from deeper regional groundwater zamora et al 2012 this pattern further suggests that the shallow porewater is a combination of warmer surface waters mixing with cooler groundwater in the hyporheic zone thus the vertical spatial differences in excess n2 likely reflect water source e g deep groundwater vs mixing of surface and ground waters in hyporheic zone rather than inherent differences in in situ denitrification rates between the two depths models of surface water groundwater interactions in the study area estimated that only about 10 of the surface waters during the summer low flow season originates from groundwater inputs making groundwater a minor hydrologic source of surface waters overall zamora et al 2012 hence these findings support the suggestion above that the two depths represent different water sources mixing of surface and ground waters at the 0 31 m depth is further supported by the higher sc values ms cm 1 at 1 82 m mean 2 96 0 25 versus 0 31 m mean 2 43 0 18 which suggest dilution of sc in the 0 31 m samples by surface waters that had a median sc of 0 98 ms cm 1 table s2 this would also suggest potential dilution and or degassing of dissolved n2 at the 0 31 m depth additionally the negative correlation between excess n2 in shallow but not deeper porewaters and no3 in surface waters r 0 41 p 0 001 supports the mixing of surface water shallow porewater while deeper hyporheic porewaters most likely originate from groundwater high spatial and temporal variability hot spots hot moments commonly associated with denitrification processes was reflected at all spatial scales in this study bernard jannin et al 2017 rivers often switch between a nitrate sink and source due to upwelling of groundwater or downwelling of surface water within the hyporheic zone li et al 2017 in this study variability in excess n2 was primarily associated with variations in no3 and dissolved oxygen as depicted by the negative relationship between no3 and excess n2 when no3 concentrations were 0 1 mg n l 1 fig 4 this negative relationship was also found in the permanent groundwater wells screened between 3 7 m and in a previous study hinshaw and dahlgren 2016 this negative relationship is consistent with a dominant role for denitrification in consuming no3 and producing excess n2 gas site 154 5 km was of particular interest given its high no3 concentrations 10 2 1 1 mg n l 1 and low excess n2 1 mg n l this site is located just downstream of a wastewater treatment plant tertiary treatment located on the east bank during the growing season march june the majority of its treated effluent is disposed of as irrigation water for pastures that occur within 1 km of the river thus large volumes of no3 rich waters are added to the land surface which presumably introduces localized no3 rich groundwater having a relatively short residence time before emerging as surface waters in the sjr deep monitoring wells 13 2 16 8 m within and surrounding the irrigated pasture were measured in the same manner as the riparian groundwater wells the mean no3 concentration was 6 1 mg n l 1 range 0 01 23 8 and mean excess n2 concentrations was 4 6 mg n l 1 range 1 35 8 92 mg n l 1 table s4 therefore these deeper groundwaters do not appear to be the primary source of the hyporheic porewaters given their higher levels of excess n2 and generally lower no3 concentrations rather we posit that a shallow groundwater flow path having insufficient residence time to allow for appreciable denitrification is the primary source of the hyporheic porewaters at site 154 5 km estimated groundwater flow rates of 0 03 0 12 m3 s 1 for the lower sjr could support a wide range of groundwater residence times zamora et al 2012 therefore for this specific section of the sjr higher flow rate lower residence time flowpaths may prevent the onset of anoxic conditions hindering denitrification and no3 consumption assuming sufficiently anaerobic conditions to support denitrification or other mechanisms of n removal occurring under anaerobic conditions such as anammox or dnra groundwater sources will accumulate excess n2 concentrations along the groundwater flowpath until either no3 or doc is depleted which was supported by the mean concentration of excess n2 in groundwater wells 7 18 0 48 being nearly five times greater compared to the overall mean of excess n2 concentrations within hyporheic porewaters 1 48 0 14 trauth et al 2014 found that groundwater flow had a greater influence over denitrification rates than stream discharge and emphasized the importance of accounting for groundwater inputs into the hyporheic zone 4 2 denitrification potential rates denitrification potential rates were measured in the year following the longitudinal study to verify if denitrification was a prevalent process within hyporheic porewaters out of the 144 dnp incubations 86 demonstrated denitrifying activity despite oxygenated mixing of surface water within the hyporheic zone nitrification was considered negligible due to low or undetectable nh4 within sjr surface waters hinshaw and dahlgren 2013 dnp rates displayed high spatial variability within sites among sites and between seasons april vs september as is often found in such studies dnp rates were greater than those compared to a study in agriculturally impacted lakes liu et al 2015 and those found in natural and forested wetlands gardner and white 2010 harrison et al 2011 genthner et al 2013 the similarity between dnp rates in the no3 c amendments and no3 originally suggests no appreciable carbon limitation for denitrifiers in spite of the rather low total carbon concentrations 0 08 0 63 this is consistent with several similar studies that found that no3 and not organic carbon limited sediment denitrification esteves et al 2001 wall et al 2005 however in this study stepwise regression suggested a positive contribution from oxc owing to this fraction being most available for bacterial metabolism the role of oxc is also supported by the data from site 173 5 km which had the highest oxc concentrations west and the corresponding highest dnp rates when no3 concentrations are high concentrations of oxc become more crucial for attenuating no3 by stimulating denitrification activity and driving complete nitrate reduction to n2 firestone et al 1980 similar results have been found in low carbon and elevated no3 stream and river sediments bernhardt and likens 2002 inwood et al 2007 findlay et al 2011 further xu et al 2015 concluded that high organic matter is necessary to sustain low no3 concentrations via denitrification in agricultural groundwater the relationship of higher dnp rates with lower psd has been found in several previous studies pinay et al 2000 opdyke and david 2007 welsh et al 2017 similar to this study d haene et al 2003 found denitrification rates were highest in clay soil and lowest in sandy soils fine textured sediments such as clay and silt often harbor higher concentrations of carbon lower oxygen concentrations and more suitable attachment sites for bacteria attenuating their downstream advection iribar et al 2008 identified denitrifying bacteria communities attached to aquifer sediment that exhibited higher denitrification enzyme activity the significantly higher dnp rates in no3 and no3 c treatments from the east to west bank is consistent with the finer textured sediments resulting from the contrasting sediment sources table 2 5 conclusions the predominantly elevated excess n2 concentrations and overall low no3 concentrations mean 0 91 mg n l 1 in deeper porewaters suggest that the sjr riparian and hyporheic zones act as an effective anoxic barrier to no3 transport from regional groundwaters to surface water sites with low or negligible n2 tended to have high concentrations of no3 and do along with low doc indicating inhibition of denitrification dnp rates confirmed the prevalence of high denitrification capacity within hyporheic sediments of the sjr oxidizable c fraction was the key factor limiting dnp rates highlighting the importance of microbially labile c in fueling denitrification this study suggests that riparian and hyporheic zone management and restoration activities that focus on increasing inputs of carbon and water transport residence times provide an opportunity for enhancing denitrification in hydrologic systems subject to high no3 loading declaration of competing interest the

18418,a suite of biomarkers including amino acids pigments and lignin phenols coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry were used to evaluate differences in the sources and fate of organic matter om in everglades treatment wetlands as a model for om cycling in shallow water wetlands five components of the system water column particulate matter vertical traps flocculent material periphyton and surface soil were assessed for om transformations down profile i e water column to soil and between treatment cells dominated by emergent aquatic vegetation eav and submerged aquatic vegetation sav with comparisons to reference sites within the remnant everglades we found that om cycling is fundamentally different between eav and sav wetlands and that sav wetlands have some shared characteristics with similar habitats in the remnant everglades other than locations densely populated by typha spp water column particulate organic c was predominantly derived from microbial cryptomonad sources rather than macroscopic sources vascular plants and algal mats bacterial amino acid biomarkers were positively correlated with amino acid degradation indices and organic p po respectively suggesting that microbial abundance is associated with less degraded om and that further investigation into relationships between microbial biomass and po is warranted overall this multi biomarker approach can elucidate the relative degradation of om pools identify sources of om and highlight the importance of water column processes in shallow water wetlands graphical abstract image 1 keywords treatment wetlands everglades amino acids pigments lignin biomarkers 1 introduction the everglades is a naturally oligotrophic phosphorus p limited system that contains a diversity of ecosystems fig 1 regional agricultural and urban development resulted in the loss of half its spatial extent and its separation into hydrological subregions the water conservation areas wca and everglades national park enp light and dineen 1994 due to these changes in land use many areas of the everglades are affected by excess p which has altered vegetation communities habitat and landscape structure biogeochemical cycles and microbial activities richardson et al 2007 to minimize effects to downstream systems the p criterion of 10 μg l 1 tp 13 μg l 1 flow weighted mean was established sfwmd 2000 sfwmd 2006 us epa 2000 and numerous management strategies have been implemented including the construction of 23 000 ha of stormwater treatment areas stas chimney 2019 these stas are model shallow water wetlands that can be used to evaluate relationships between vegetation communities organic matter om and p loading the stas significantly reduce external loads of total phosphorus tp by reducing water column tp concentrations but sources of internally produced om and mechanisms driving om turnover in these systems are not thoroughly known dierberg and debusk 2008 and may contribute to dissolved and or particulate organic phosphorus pools dop and pop respectively biomarkers or compounds that retain characteristics of their biological sources bianchi and canuel 2011 are commonly used to evaluate om sources turnover and preservation in numerous systems biomarkers have previously been used within the everglades but few studies have used biomarkers to link om and p dynamics particularly in the context of treatment wetland performance pisani et al 2013 saunders et al 2015 previously biomarkers such as an n alkane aquatic proxy paq c20 highly branched isoprenoids and botryococcenes were used to identify om sources within ridge and slough landscapes saunders et al 2015 and to trace the origin and fate of flocculent floc material in the florida coastal everglades pisani et al 2013 other biomarkers that can trace om sources and turnover include amino acids pigments and lignin degradation indices di of each have been used as indicators of om decay in marine lacustrine terrestrial and wetland systems bianchi and findlay 1991 chen et al 2003 dauwe et al 1999 philben et al 2016 pisani et al 2013 the amino acid di is driven by the loss of labile amino acids like leu ile and arg and an enrichment in the more recalcitrant amino acid gly during diagenesis dauwe et al 1999 duan and bianchi 2007 philben et al 2016 shields et al 2019 pigment decay products such as pheophorbide and pheophytin are produced by heterotrophic activity and accumulate in soils bianchi and findlay 1991 chen et al 2003 and as such a pigment di can be calculated as the ratio of chl a degradation products to chl a pisani et al 2013 for lignin phenols the oxidative degradation of aldehydes increases the proportion of acid phenols allowing the acid aldehyde ratios of syringyl and vanillyl phenols ad als and ad alv respectively to act as indicators of lignin degradation bianchi and canuel 2011 hedges et al 1988 although it can be biased if there is extensive leaching of acid phenols barry et al 2018 hernes et al 2007 jex et al 2014 additionally high resolution mass spectrometry techniques such as electrospray ionization fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry esi ft icr ms are untargeted approaches that can provide information regarding an environmental sample s molecular composition and can be particularly insightful for investigating dop within impacted waterbodies brooker et al 2018 here we use amino acids pigments and lignin phenols coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry methods to evaluate the utility of biomarkers as indicators of decay and tracers of om sources assess relationships between om quality and microbial biomarkers and examine how vegetation photosynthetic communities and p loading impact om cycling in shallow water wetlands although sta research is relevant for the health of the everglades ecosystem the concepts and approaches addressed here are also informative for treatment wetlands throughout the world including those in developing nations kivaisi 2001 as the linkages between in situ om production decay can have implications for the sustainability of treatment wetland performance wu et al 2015 2 methods 2 1 site description sampling was conducted in may 2018 at four treatment wetland sites in sta 3 4 and two reference sites located in water conservation area wca 2a fig 1 the treatment wetland sites sta sites were in either an emergent aquatic vegetation eav dominated cell or a submerged aquatic vegetation sav dominated cell an inflow and outflow site were selected for each cell and sites are referred to by their dominant vegetation type eav or sav and position along the treatment flow path inflow or outflow the two reference sites were located along a well studied p gradient within water conservation area 2a and represent an intermediate p mixed vegetation community and a relatively unimpacted ridge and slough landscape samples were collected within the slough the two reference sites are hereafter referred to as the intermediate and unimpacted reference site respectively official site codes are listed in table s1 due to the number of analytical techniques used in this study only a limited number of samples could be analyzed as such we were not able to capture seasonal variability within this study while seasonal dynamics as well as variability in flow regimes play an important role in p and om cycling in this system pisani et al 2013 this work establishes novel links between chemical biomarkers ft icr ms and im qtof ms signatures that will provide a foundation for such studies in the future 2 1 1 sample collection and processing triplicate samples were collected from the water column vertical traps described below flocculent material floc surface 0 5 cm soil and vegetation algal end members triplicate periphyton samples were also collected from the unimpacted reference site water column grab samples were collected using a 20 l carboy kept at ambient temperature until brought to the laboratory 4 h where they were kept at 4 c in the dark prior to filtration water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm glass fiber filters gf fs and separated for pom and dom fractions within 48 h of collection aliquots of filtered and unfiltered water were taken for subsequent analyses at the university of florida uf s organic geochemistry laboratory ogl and wetland biogeochemistry laboratory wbl the remaining filtered water was preserved at 20 c for dom extraction section 1 2 7 soil samples were collected using a 10 cm inner diameter polycarbonate core with a beveled head soil cores were maintained intact until brought to the laboratory 4 h where they were extruded and sectioned into floc and 0 5 cm soil samples unconsolidated floc was visually identified according to droppo 2001 and hagerthey et al 2008 vertical traps were constructed out of four open polyvinyl chloride tubes according to leonard et al 2006 and were deployed at treatment wetland sites three months prior to sampling vertical traps were not deployed in the reference sites due to low water levels at time of deployment after floc soil and vertical trap samples were collected they were stored at 20 c prior to freeze drying and homogenized via roller mill prior to analysis 2 2 bulk parameters all samples pom filters floc soil vertical trap periphyton and

chromatography system coupled to a thermo scientific tsq endura h esi triple quadrupole mass spectrometer thermofisher scientific waltham ma usa a degradation index di value was generated for each sample with equation 1 according to philben et al 2016 1 d i v a r i a v g i s d i p c 1 i where var i avg i and sd i are the relative molar abundance mean and standard deviation of each amino acid respectively and pc1 i is the loading score of the amino acid on the first principal component a lower di value indicates greater degradation 2 2 2 pigments pigments were extracted from samples using acetone and sonication following the csiro method published in hooker et al 2010 pigments and carotenoids were analyzed by ultra high performance liquid chromatography uplc coupled to a diode array detector dad with a dionex ultimate 3000 lc and a dionex dad 3000 thermofisher scientific waltham ma usa with the solvent system of van heukelem and thomas 2001 the dad data was collected at a rate of

chlorophyll a chlorophyll e epimer chlorophyll a allomer chlorophyllide a and pyrochlorophyllide a a higher di denotes greater degradation 2 2 3 lignin the equivalent of 5 mg 1 mg of oc for each sample or whole freeze dried gf f pom were analyzed for lignin phenols using a cupric oxide oxidation method according to hutchings et al 2019 after hedges and ertel 1982 as modified by goñi and hedges 1995 lignin oxidation products were separated using an agilent db 5ms column 30 m length 0 25 mm internal diameter agilent technologies santa clara ca usa within a thermo scientific trace 1310

high resolution mass spectrometry filtered water samples were frozen at 20 c section 1 2 2 and one field replicate per site was processed n 6 via solid phase extraction spe to extract dom according to the method of dittmar et al 2008 after spe samples were eluted with methanol divided into two aliquots and dried down to a few microliters one aliquot was analyzed via ion mobility quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry im qtof ms at texas a m university and the other aliquot was analyzed via a 12 t fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms at the pacific northwest national laboratory pnnl with a mass range of 105 2000 da the ultrahigh resolution of ft icr ms permits assignment of elemental formulas based on observed accurate mass while im qtof ms permits identification of possible isomers of organic compounds 2 3 results 2 3 1 bulk geochemical parameters the eav inflow site had significantly greater tss 57 mg l 1 and poc 23 7 mg l 1 concentrations

2011 hedges et al 1988 hedges and mann 1979 were also consistently greater than zero for all samples the ratio of acid aldehydes for syringyl ad als and vanillyl phenols ad alv is commonly used as an indicator of the degradation state of lignin bianchi and canuel 2011 hedges et al 1988 the pom of the sav outflow site had the lowest ad als value 0 05 while the live above ground tissue of eleocharis

mass spectrometry high resolution mass spectrometry can be used to evaluate the aromaticity mass elemental composition and isomer abundance of dom the aromaticity index ai can be used to provide a structural characterization of dom koch and dittmar 2006 and the number of features corresponding to each ai category koch and dittmar 2006 was determined for each site table s5 for all sites the majority of features had an ai less than 0 5 approx 70 of features table s5 the number of features with an ai greater than 0 5 aromatic ranged from 101 in the intermediate reference site to 205 in the eav inflow site with a greater proportion of aromatic and condensed aromatic features in the eav sites table s5 across sites the most abundant elemental formulae were cho 58 65 of assigned formulae while chop formulae were the least abundant 0 28 0 52 of assigned formulae features containing p were identified and are hereafter referred to as dissolved organic p dop the most abundant masses of dop were between 300 and 400 da which was also the most abundant mass range of the total dom pool however the total dom pool had a broader distribution of masses when compared to dop fig s2 the elemental ratios of features identified via ft icr ms were also used to identify general compound classes d andrilli et al 2015 and averaged elemental ratios were calculated to understand overall chemical differences between these sites fig s3 im qtof ms data revealed that less than 1 of the features unique masses observed in esi were isomers while 4 7 of the features observed in esi had isomers table s5 2 5 discussion 2 5 1 biomarkers as indicators of decay degradation indices for amino acids pigments and lignin phenols highlighted differences in om processing in each wetland type vertical gradients in redox potential are a dominant control of om decomposition in the everglades larsen and harvey 2010 we found that the mean di values for both amino acids fig 2a and pigments fig 2b indicated progressive degradation of om along the depth profile i e from pom to soils likely due to the vertical gradient in redox potential or possibly due to vertical gradients in nutrients debusk and reddy 2005 highlighting the extensive re working of these fresh om pools and the utility of these indices as tracers of decay however the pigment di of the eav sites and intermediate reference site showed little change down profile i e from pom to soils fig 2b supporting previous studies that have shown altered photosynthetic communities namely a reduction in periphyton and primary production due to light limitation associated with dense typha stands grimshaw and wetzel 1997 noe et al 2001 the lignin degradation indices ad als and ad alv were not as sensitive as those of amino acids and pigments fig 2c and d with relatively less degraded 0 3 ad alv ratios for most samples and highly degraded 0 16 ad als values for many samples likely due to more rapid degradation of syringyl phenols relative to vanillyls hedges et al 1988 jex et al 2014 additionally no sample exceeded an ad al of 0 6 suggesting that there was minimal leaching of acid lignin phenols in this system hernes et al 2007 based on the amino acid di the reference sites pom had more degraded amino acids when compared to those of the treatment wetland sites both eav and sav suggesting that there may either be less production of pom or greater rates of amino acid turnover in the reference sites water column in contrast the reference and sav sites had the least degraded pigment di while the eav sites had the most degraded pigment signatures likely due to more abundant periphyton and photosynthetic communities within low p areas of the everglades gaiser et al 2006 hagerthey et al 2008 pisani et al 2013 waters et al 2013 the differences in patterns between amino acid and pigment dis highlight the source specific nature of pigments while amino acids are a better characterization of bulk om lignin degradation indices showed that the ad alv of pom and floc of the sav sites was higher than other sites while ad als was greater in the unimpacted reference site suggesting that there is less autochthonous production of fresh lignin within non eav sites which agrees with the findings of penton and newman 2008 who found that decomposition in everglades slough habitats was less influenced by lignin when compared to sawgrass ridges overall the differences seen between wetland types indicate that om turnover and sources are fundamentally different between wetland types i e eav sav and reference sites with more degraded amino acids and lignin signatures and less degraded pigments in non eav sites although all three biomarkers provided information about the degradation of their respective om pools for applications that may only be able to support one biomarker of study amino acids appear to be the most informative of the biomarkers investigated here 2 5 2 biomarkers as indicators of om sources hydroxyproline hyp is a structural amino acid within cell walls of vascular plants philben and benner 2013 and green algae johnson et al 2017 and was found in greatest concentrations in the pom of the treatment sites but was not detected within the pom of the reference sites table s2 the algal end members of the sav outflow site had high hyp concentrations relative to vascular plant endmembers table s2 suggesting that hyp was predominantly derived from green algae and highlighting the importance of algal derived om inputs within sav sites additionally nine of the ten highest concentrations of gamma aminobutyric acid gaba were found in plant end members suggesting the compound actually measured is beta aminobutyric acid an isomer that cannot be distinguished from gaba in our analytical method and is known to be produced as a stress response in plants thevenet et al 2017 taxon specific pigments are commonly used to identify members of photosynthetic communities and their response to water quality louda et al 2015 paerl et al 2003 in other areas of the everglades experimental p enrichment studies and historic reconstructions have documented a shift from cyanobacteria and diatom dominated communities to green algae as p enrichment proceeds gaiser et al 2006 mccormick et al 2001 2002 waters et al 2013 pre impoundment c 1900s photosynthetic communities were likely diverse and included both periphytic cyanobacteria green algae and planktonic cryptophytes taxa waters et al 2013 we found that higher concentrations of alloxanthin cryptophytes and fucoxanthan diatoms drove sav and reference site pom to cluster away from plant and algal end members fig 3 indicating that cryptophytes and diatoms are abundant members of photosynthetic communities in this system louda et al 2015 pisani et al 2013 waters et al 2013 diatoms have been found in a diversity of everglades habitats ranging from the coastal everglades pisani et al 2013 to historic pre marl oligotrophic sloughs waters et al 2013 and we found that the concentration of fucoxanthan diatoms was greatest in the pom of all sites except the eav inflow site we also found that echinenone echi and myxoxanthan myxo which are associated with filamentous cyanobacteria in marl periphyton mccormick and o dell 1996 pisani et al 2013 waters et al 2013 were high in the floc of both reference sites and the periphyton of the unimpacted reference site interestingly there were also high concentrations of mxyo and echi in the vertical traps of the eav outflow and sav inflow sites suggesting that cyanobacteria may also be present in vertical traps although likely different community types as a function of degree of p enrichment gaiser et al 2006 mccormick et al 2001 chlorophyll b chl b and lutein have been used as indicators of chlorophytes in the everglades pisani et al 2013 although it is also present in macrophytes waters et al 2013 we found that both were high in chara and algal endmembers and the greatest levels of chl b were in the sav treatment sites indicating high om contributions of chara and algae and possibly chlorophytes at these sites chlorophytes have been associated with moderate p enrichment gaiser et al 2015 mccormick et al 2001 but we cannot conclusively determine if high chl b and lutein were from chlorophytes chara or algae in this system this work indicates that photosynthetic community composition shifts with altered water quality and vegetation communities hagerthey et al 2008 slate and jan stevenson 2006 waters et al 2013 and that pigment profiles for the reference and sav sites were consistently less degraded than the eav sites indicating greater autochthonous production of pigments within their water columns the ratio of cinnamyl to vanillyl phenols c v and the ratio of syringyl to vanillyl phenols s v indicated that all sites had lignin derived from non woody angiosperm vegetation hedges and mann 1979 which is consistent with the vegetation of this area inglett and reddy 2006 both measures of total lignin concentrations λ8 and σ8 were greatest in the floc and soil of eav sites table s4 indicating greater vascular plant inputs at this site goñi and hedges 1995 and further highlighting differences in om sources between wetland types this finding was also supported by the high resolution mass spectrometry data as a greater proportion of aromatic and condensed aromatic features were seen in the eav sites table s5 likely associated with vascular plant inputs this suite of biomarkers and high resolution mass spectrometry data indicated that dense typha stands at the eav inflow are associated with greater vascular plant inputs greater aromaticity reduced pigment inputs and higher pigment degradation however for treatment wetlands that do not have mixed vegetation communities comprised of woody and non woody species or angiosperm and gymnosperm species amino acids and pigments are more sensitive tracers of om sources relative to lignin c v and s v ratios 2 5 3 biomarkers related to water column processes in addition to acting as an indicators of decay and tracers of om sources amino acids also revealed relationships between om pools and microbial indicators we found that the amino acid di was positively correlated with two bacterial biomarkers mura and dapa fig 4 a mura and dapa are both exclusively found in bacteria carroll and hobden 2016 west et al 1987 and have been used as bacterial biomarkers in a diversity of systems appuhn and joergensen 2006 hutchings et al 2018 philben et al 2014 the positive relationship between bacterial markers and the amino acid di suggests that there is greater microbial biomass and likely associated microbial activity within the less degraded pom of the water column studies of substrate induced respiration within p enriched and oligotrophic areas of the everglades have shown that a variety of substrates including amino acids can enhance microbial heterotrophic activity within everglades soil and detritus wright and reddy 2007 additionally mura and dapa were positively correlated fig 4b as has been seen in a variety of other sediment types hutchings et al 2018 the positive relationship between these two markers suggests that there may be conserved mechanisms relating to the preservation and or turnover of bacterial biomass in wetland soils which may possibly be linked to the composition of microbial communities it has been suggested that mura and dapa are specific biomarkers for gram positive and gram negative bacteria respectively as mura is present in peptidoglycan which is abundant in the cell walls of gram positive bacteria however mura can also be found in gram negative bacterial biomass albeit in lower concentrations appuhn and joergensen 2006 most gram negative bacteria have dapa in the tetrapeptide side chain of their peptidoglycan while gram positive bacteria often have l lysine although there are some gram positive bacteria that can have dapa in their peptidoglycan as well carroll and hobden 2016 since neither mura and dapa are entirely exclusive to either bacterial group further study is needed to quantify the relative distribution of these biomarkers within gram positive and gram negative bacteria and their relationship between microbial community composition particularly within wetland soils interestingly we also found that dapa and mura concentrations were positively correlated with tpo concentrations in the treatment wetland sites but not in the reference sites likely because p loading can be associated with greater microbial biomass and heterotrophic activity white and reddy 2000 fig 5 and suggesting that relationships between microorganisms and p may differ between treatment and reference sites however tp and tpi could not be analyzed for the floc samples of the intermediate reference site see supplementary methods which may limit our ability to detect relationships within the reference sites additionally previous studies have found that 65 of pp was microbially derived noe and childers 2007 supporting this positive relationship between tpo and bacterial biomarkers which further indicates that microbial p cycling should be investigated further within treatment wetlands a principal component analysis of the amino acid pigment and lignin biomarkers fig 3 allowed us to further investigate unique characteristics of water column processes between sites from top right to bottom left om shows progressive decay along soil profiles from the plant endmember to soils described further in section 1 4 1 however pom samples clustered away from all other om pools including endmembers which was largely driven by greater concentrations of alloxanthin fucoxanthin p hydroxy phenols pad and pon and tyrosine the only site whose pom did not show this relationship was the eav inflow site likely due to the influence of dense eav which suppresses water column gross primary production grimshaw and wetzel 1997 noe et al 2001 and subsequently limits o2 availability and decreases c turnover hagerthey et al 2010 the eav inflow was also particle dominated with greater tss and poc relative to other sites due to litter contributions from dense stands of typha spp while the rest of the sites had low tss and poc which has been documented for much of the freshwater everglades childers 2006 to investigate dom composition with a less targeted but higher resolution approach we used high resolution mass spectrometry to evaluate differences in water column dom between wetland types dom characterization using ft icr ms enabled molecular level understanding of thousands of observed features with both known and unknown compounds however ft icr ms is not capable of separating structural isomers sleighter and hatcher 2008 as such compounds with the same exact mass but different structures and thus potentially different lability may be falsely classified into the same compound group zark and dittmar 2018 proposed that isomer diversity is related to the degradation state of dom and some compounds may have up to 100 different isomers based on a central limit theorem using im qtof ms lu et al 2018 observed about 10 of detected compounds have 1 to 4 isomers our esi data from im qtof ms showed similar isomer proportions 3 9 7 4 with some of the unique masses accounting for up to 5 isomers interestingly the greatest percentage of masses with isomers in esi was seen in the intermediate and unimpacted reference sites 6 4 and 7 4 respectively which warrants further investigation into microbial turnover of dom in this system and its relationship to isomer abundance however the esi data suggested less than 1 of the observed unique masses have isomers table s5 esi preferentially ionizes basic functional groups while esi preferentially ionize dom moiety containing acidic functional groups such as the carboxylic groups kujawinski 2002 the different proportion of detected features with isomers under the two ionization methods may provide clues to compound lability and transformations for instance observations in esi ft icr ms suggested preferential oxidation of phenolics compounds which may explain the lack of isomers observed in esi during microbial oxidation of aromatic compounds the isomers are likely phenolic compounds with different substitution positions ortho meta and para which isomeric difference is not detectable in the current ion mobility resolution the combination of ft icr ms and im qtof ms combine an unprecedented mass resolution and ability to examine isomeric diversity of dom lastly the averaged elemental ratios of the sav outflow had higher o c and lower h c than the rest of the sites fig s3 suggesting higher oxidation of predominately phenolic compounds e g lignins or tannins possibly due to high biological turnover at these sites when comparing dop characteristics across all sites we observed that most of the lipids and protein like dop were unique to sav sites fig 6 supporting other biomarkers in this study that indicate that the sav sites are characterized by fresh recent om production within their water columns although the most abundant mass range was the same 300 400 da between dop and the total dom pool fig s2 the dop pool had a more limited range of masses suggesting that smaller molecules possibly biologically derived may be contributing to dop within the system additionally im qtof ms information suggested that much of the higher molecular weight dop 500 da such as phospho proteins have at least two isomers which warrants further investigation into the isomeric diversity and bioavailability of dop in this system 3 conclusions the biomarkers studied here tracked the degradation and sources of om within shallow water wetlands and highlighted linkages between bacterial indicators and less degraded i e fresh om within water columns amino acid biomarkers were particularly informative as indicators of degradation while pigments were most useful for evaluating the structure of photosynthetic taxa additionally the unique signatures of pom relative to other sample types suggests that water column processes differ for each wetland type as has been seen in other regions of the everglades hagerthey et al 2010 we found that dense typha stands fundamentally alter om inputs and photosynthetic communities resulting in altered taxa more degraded pigment profiles and a greater number of aromatic features detected by high resolution mass spectrometry sites dominated by sav had less degraded amino acid inputs largely dominated by algal and microbial sources with dom distinguished by lipids and proteins suggesting high biological activity within sav water columns reference sites had the least degraded pigment profiles driven by mixed communities of cyanobacteria diatoms and cryptomonads the strong relationship between the amino acid di and bacterial biomarkers highlights the importance of microbial om turnover in shallow water wetlands hagerthey et al 2010 and the importance of bacterial p cycling white and reddy 2000 wright and reddy 2001 overall these findings indicate that this suite of biomarkers are a refined tool to investigate om dynamics within shallow water wetlands to provide a comprehensive perspective on the source quality and diversity of om and the role that photosynthetic and microbial communities play in the cycling of om in shallow water wetlands declaration of competing interest the authors

18418,a suite of biomarkers including amino acids pigments and lignin phenols coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry were used to evaluate differences in the sources and fate of organic matter om in everglades treatment wetlands as a model for om cycling in shallow water wetlands five components of the system water column particulate matter vertical traps flocculent material periphyton and surface soil were assessed for om transformations down profile i e water column to soil and between treatment cells dominated by emergent aquatic vegetation eav and submerged aquatic vegetation sav with comparisons to reference sites within the remnant everglades we found that om cycling is fundamentally different between eav and sav wetlands and that sav wetlands have some shared characteristics with similar habitats in the remnant everglades other than locations densely populated by typha spp water column particulate organic c was predominantly derived from microbial cryptomonad sources rather than macroscopic sources vascular plants and algal mats bacterial amino acid biomarkers were positively correlated with amino acid degradation indices and organic p po respectively suggesting that microbial abundance is associated with less degraded om and that further investigation into relationships between microbial biomass and po is warranted overall this multi biomarker approach can elucidate the relative degradation of om pools identify sources of om and highlight the importance of water column processes in shallow water wetlands graphical abstract image 1 keywords treatment wetlands everglades amino acids pigments lignin biomarkers 1 introduction the everglades is a naturally oligotrophic phosphorus p limited system that contains a diversity of ecosystems fig 1 regional agricultural and urban development resulted in the loss of half its spatial extent and its separation into hydrological subregions the water conservation areas wca and everglades national park enp light and dineen 1994 due to these changes in land use many areas of the everglades are affected by excess p which has altered vegetation communities habitat and landscape structure biogeochemical cycles and microbial activities richardson et al 2007 to minimize effects to downstream systems the p criterion of 10 μg l 1 tp 13 μg l 1 flow weighted mean was established sfwmd 2000 sfwmd 2006 us epa 2000 and numerous management strategies have been implemented including the construction of 23 000 ha of stormwater treatment areas stas chimney 2019 these stas are model shallow water wetlands that can be used to evaluate relationships between vegetation communities organic matter om and p loading the stas significantly reduce external loads of total phosphorus tp by reducing water column tp concentrations but sources of internally produced om and mechanisms driving om turnover in these systems are not thoroughly known dierberg and debusk 2008 and may contribute to dissolved and or particulate organic phosphorus pools dop and pop respectively biomarkers or compounds that retain characteristics of their biological sources bianchi and canuel 2011 are commonly used to evaluate om sources turnover and preservation in numerous systems biomarkers have previously been used within the everglades but few studies have used biomarkers to link om and p dynamics particularly in the context of treatment wetland performance pisani et al 2013 saunders et al 2015 previously biomarkers such as an n alkane aquatic proxy paq c20 highly branched isoprenoids and botryococcenes were used to identify om sources within ridge and slough landscapes saunders et al 2015 and to trace the origin and fate of flocculent floc material in the florida coastal everglades pisani et al 2013 other biomarkers that can trace om sources and turnover include amino acids pigments and lignin degradation indices di of each have been used as indicators of om decay in marine lacustrine terrestrial and wetland systems bianchi and findlay 1991 chen et al 2003 dauwe et al 1999 philben et al 2016 pisani et al 2013 the amino acid di is driven by the loss of labile amino acids like leu ile and arg and an enrichment in the more recalcitrant amino acid gly during diagenesis dauwe et al 1999 duan and bianchi 2007 philben et al 2016 shields et al 2019 pigment decay products such as pheophorbide and pheophytin are produced by heterotrophic activity and accumulate in soils bianchi and findlay 1991 chen et al 2003 and as such a pigment di can be calculated as the ratio of chl a degradation products to chl a pisani et al 2013 for lignin phenols the oxidative degradation of aldehydes increases the proportion of acid phenols allowing the acid aldehyde ratios of syringyl and vanillyl phenols ad als and ad alv respectively to act as indicators of lignin degradation bianchi and canuel 2011 hedges et al 1988 although it can be biased if there is extensive leaching of acid phenols barry et al 2018 hernes et al 2007 jex et al 2014 additionally high resolution mass spectrometry techniques such as electrospray ionization fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry esi ft icr ms are untargeted approaches that can provide information regarding an environmental sample s molecular composition and can be particularly insightful for investigating dop within impacted waterbodies brooker et al 2018 here we use amino acids pigments and lignin phenols coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry methods to evaluate the utility of biomarkers as indicators of decay and tracers of om sources assess relationships between om quality and microbial biomarkers and examine how vegetation photosynthetic communities and p loading impact om cycling in shallow water wetlands although sta research is relevant for the health of the everglades ecosystem the concepts and approaches addressed here are also informative for treatment wetlands throughout the world including those in developing nations kivaisi 2001 as the linkages between in situ om production decay can have implications for the sustainability of treatment wetland performance wu et al 2015 2 methods 2 1 site description sampling was conducted in may 2018 at four treatment wetland sites in sta 3 4 and two reference sites located in water conservation area wca 2a fig 1 the treatment wetland sites sta sites were in either an emergent aquatic vegetation eav dominated cell or a submerged aquatic vegetation sav dominated cell an inflow and outflow site were selected for each cell and sites are referred to by their dominant vegetation type eav or sav and position along the treatment flow path inflow or outflow the two reference sites were located along a well studied p gradient within water conservation area 2a and represent an intermediate p mixed vegetation community and a relatively unimpacted ridge and slough landscape samples were collected within the slough the two reference sites are hereafter referred to as the intermediate and unimpacted reference site respectively official site codes are listed in table s1 due to the number of analytical techniques used in this study only a limited number of samples could be analyzed as such we were not able to capture seasonal variability within this study while seasonal dynamics as well as variability in flow regimes play an important role in p and om cycling in this system pisani et al 2013 this work establishes novel links between chemical biomarkers ft icr ms and im qtof ms signatures that will provide a foundation for such studies in the future 2 1 1 sample collection and processing triplicate samples were collected from the water column vertical traps described below flocculent material floc surface

core with a beveled head soil cores were maintained intact until brought to the laboratory 4 h where they were extruded and sectioned into floc and 0 5 cm soil samples unconsolidated floc was visually identified according to droppo 2001 and hagerthey et al 2008 vertical traps were constructed out of four open polyvinyl chloride tubes according to leonard et al 2006 and were deployed at treatment wetland sites three months prior to sampling vertical traps were not deployed in the reference sites due to low water levels at time of deployment after floc soil and vertical trap samples were collected they were stored at 20 c prior to freeze drying and homogenized via roller mill prior to analysis 2 2 bulk parameters all samples pom filters floc soil vertical trap periphyton and

respectively and pc1 i is the loading score of the amino acid on the first principal component a lower di value indicates greater degradation 2 2 2 pigments pigments were extracted from samples using

national laboratory pnnl with a mass range of 105 2000 da the ultrahigh resolution of ft icr ms permits assignment of elemental formulas based on observed accurate mass while im qtof ms permits

mass spectrometry high resolution mass spectrometry can be used to evaluate the aromaticity mass elemental composition and isomer abundance of dom the aromaticity index ai can be used to provide a structural characterization of dom koch and dittmar 2006 and the number of features corresponding to each ai category koch and dittmar 2006 was determined for each site table s5 for all sites the majority of features had an ai less than 0 5 approx 70 of features table s5 the number of features with an ai greater than 0 5 aromatic ranged from 101 in the intermediate reference site to 205 in the

elemental ratios of features identified via ft icr ms were also used to identify general compound classes d andrilli et al 2015 and averaged elemental ratios were calculated to understand overall chemical differences between these sites fig s3 im qtof ms data revealed that less than 1 of the features unique masses observed in esi were isomers while 4 7 of the features observed in esi had isomers table s5 2 5 discussion 2 5 1 biomarkers as indicators of decay degradation indices for amino acids pigments and lignin phenols highlighted differences in om processing in each wetland type vertical gradients in redox potential are a dominant control of om decomposition in the everglades larsen and harvey 2010 we found that the mean di values for both amino acids fig 2a and pigments fig 2b indicated progressive degradation of om along the depth profile i e from pom to soils likely due to the vertical gradient in redox potential or possibly due to vertical gradients in nutrients debusk and reddy 2005 highlighting the extensive re working of these fresh om pools and the utility of these indices as tracers of decay however the pigment di of the eav sites and intermediate reference site showed little change down profile i e from pom to soils fig 2b supporting previous studies that have shown altered photosynthetic communities namely a reduction in periphyton and primary production due to light limitation associated with dense typha stands grimshaw and wetzel 1997 noe et al 2001 the lignin degradation indices ad als and ad alv were not as sensitive as those of amino acids and pigments fig 2c and d with relatively less degraded 0 3 ad alv ratios for most samples and highly degraded 0 16 ad als values for many samples likely due to more rapid degradation of syringyl phenols relative to vanillyls hedges et al 1988 jex et al 2014 additionally no sample exceeded an ad al of 0 6 suggesting that there was minimal leaching of acid lignin phenols in this system hernes et al 2007 based on the amino acid di the reference sites pom had more degraded amino acids when compared to those of the treatment wetland sites both eav and sav suggesting that there may either be less production of pom or greater rates of amino acid turnover in the reference sites water column in contrast the reference and sav sites had the least degraded pigment di while the eav sites had the most degraded pigment signatures likely due to more abundant periphyton and photosynthetic communities within low p areas of the everglades gaiser et al 2006 hagerthey et al 2008 pisani et al 2013 waters et al 2013 the differences in patterns between amino acid and pigment dis highlight the source specific nature of pigments while amino acids are a better characterization of bulk om lignin degradation indices showed that the ad alv of pom and floc of the sav sites was higher than other sites while ad als was greater in the unimpacted reference site suggesting that there is less autochthonous production of fresh lignin within non eav sites which agrees with the findings of penton and newman 2008 who found that decomposition in everglades slough habitats was less influenced by lignin when compared to sawgrass ridges overall the differences seen between wetland types indicate that om turnover and sources are fundamentally different between wetland types i e eav sav and reference sites with more degraded amino acids and lignin signatures and less degraded pigments in non eav sites although all three biomarkers provided information about the degradation of their respective om pools for applications that may only be able to support one biomarker of study amino acids appear to be the most informative of the biomarkers investigated here 2 5 2 biomarkers as indicators of om sources hydroxyproline hyp is a structural amino acid within cell walls of vascular plants philben and benner 2013 and green algae johnson et al 2017 and was found in greatest concentrations in the pom of the treatment sites but was not detected within the pom of the reference sites table s2 the algal end members of the sav outflow site had high hyp concentrations relative to vascular plant endmembers table s2 suggesting that hyp was predominantly derived from green algae and highlighting the importance of algal derived om inputs within sav sites additionally nine of the ten highest concentrations of gamma aminobutyric acid gaba were found in plant end members suggesting the compound actually measured is beta aminobutyric acid an isomer that cannot be distinguished from gaba in our analytical method and is known to be produced as a stress response in plants thevenet et al 2017 taxon specific pigments are commonly used to identify members of photosynthetic communities and their response to water quality louda et al 2015 paerl et al 2003 in other areas of the everglades experimental p enrichment studies and historic reconstructions have documented a shift from cyanobacteria and diatom dominated communities to green algae as p enrichment proceeds gaiser et al 2006 mccormick et al 2001 2002 waters et al 2013 pre impoundment c 1900s photosynthetic communities were likely diverse and included both periphytic cyanobacteria green algae and planktonic cryptophytes taxa waters et al 2013 we found that higher concentrations of alloxanthin cryptophytes and fucoxanthan diatoms drove sav and reference site pom to cluster away from plant and algal end members fig 3 indicating that cryptophytes and diatoms are abundant members of photosynthetic communities in this system louda et al 2015 pisani et al 2013 waters et al 2013 diatoms have been found in a diversity of everglades habitats ranging from the coastal everglades pisani et al 2013 to historic pre marl oligotrophic sloughs waters et al 2013 and we found that the concentration of fucoxanthan diatoms was greatest in the pom of all sites except the eav inflow site we also found that echinenone echi and myxoxanthan myxo which are associated with filamentous cyanobacteria in marl periphyton mccormick and o dell 1996 pisani et al 2013 waters et al 2013 were high in the floc of both reference sites and the periphyton of the unimpacted reference site interestingly there were also high concentrations of mxyo and echi in the vertical traps of the eav outflow and sav inflow sites suggesting that cyanobacteria may also be present in vertical traps although likely different community types as a function of degree of p enrichment gaiser et al 2006 mccormick et al 2001 chlorophyll b chl b and lutein have been used as indicators of chlorophytes in the everglades pisani et al 2013 although it is also present in macrophytes waters et al 2013 we found that both were high in chara and algal endmembers and the greatest levels of chl b were in the sav treatment sites indicating high om contributions of chara and algae and possibly chlorophytes at these sites chlorophytes have been associated with moderate p enrichment gaiser et al 2015 mccormick et al 2001 but we cannot conclusively determine if high chl b and lutein were from chlorophytes chara or algae in this system this work indicates that photosynthetic community composition shifts with altered water quality and vegetation communities hagerthey et al 2008 slate and jan stevenson 2006 waters et al 2013 and that pigment profiles for the reference and sav sites were consistently less degraded than the eav sites indicating greater autochthonous production of pigments within their water columns the ratio of cinnamyl to vanillyl phenols c v and the ratio of syringyl to vanillyl phenols s v indicated that all sites had lignin derived from non woody angiosperm vegetation hedges and mann 1979 which is consistent with the vegetation of this area inglett and reddy 2006 both measures of total lignin concentrations λ8 and σ8 were greatest in the floc and soil of eav sites table s4 indicating greater vascular plant inputs at this site goñi and hedges 1995 and further highlighting differences in om sources between wetland types this finding was also supported by the high resolution mass spectrometry data as a greater proportion of aromatic and condensed aromatic features were seen in the eav sites table s5 likely associated with vascular plant inputs this suite of biomarkers and high resolution mass spectrometry data indicated that dense typha stands at the eav inflow are associated with greater vascular plant inputs greater aromaticity reduced pigment inputs and higher pigment degradation however for treatment wetlands that do not have mixed vegetation communities comprised of woody and non woody species or angiosperm and gymnosperm species amino acids and pigments are more sensitive tracers of om sources relative to lignin c v and s v ratios 2 5 3 biomarkers related to water column processes in addition to acting as an indicators of decay and tracers of om sources amino acids also revealed relationships between om pools and microbial indicators we found that the amino acid di was positively correlated with two bacterial biomarkers mura and dapa fig 4 a mura and dapa are both exclusively found in bacteria carroll and hobden 2016 west et al 1987 and have been used as bacterial biomarkers in a diversity of systems appuhn and joergensen 2006 hutchings et al 2018 philben et al 2014 the positive relationship between bacterial markers and the amino acid di suggests that there is greater microbial biomass and likely associated microbial activity within the less degraded pom of the water column studies of substrate induced respiration within p enriched and oligotrophic areas of the everglades have shown that a variety of substrates including amino acids can enhance microbial heterotrophic activity within everglades soil and detritus wright and reddy 2007 additionally mura and dapa were positively correlated fig 4b as has been seen in a variety of other sediment types hutchings et al 2018 the positive relationship between these two markers suggests that there may be conserved mechanisms relating to the preservation and or turnover of bacterial biomass in wetland soils which may possibly be linked to the composition of microbial communities it has been suggested that mura and dapa are specific biomarkers for gram positive and gram negative bacteria respectively as mura is present in peptidoglycan which is abundant in the cell walls of gram positive bacteria however mura can also be found in gram negative bacterial biomass albeit in lower concentrations appuhn and joergensen 2006 most gram negative bacteria have dapa in the tetrapeptide side chain of their peptidoglycan while gram positive bacteria often have l lysine although there are some gram positive bacteria that can have dapa in their peptidoglycan as well carroll and hobden 2016 since neither mura and dapa are entirely exclusive to either bacterial group further study is needed to quantify the relative distribution of these biomarkers within gram positive and gram negative bacteria and their relationship between microbial community composition particularly within wetland soils interestingly we also found that dapa and mura concentrations were positively correlated with tpo concentrations in the treatment wetland sites but not in the reference sites likely because p loading can be associated with greater microbial biomass and heterotrophic activity white and reddy 2000 fig 5 and suggesting that relationships between microorganisms and p may differ between treatment and reference sites however tp and tpi could not be analyzed for the floc samples of the intermediate reference site see supplementary methods which may limit our ability to detect relationships within the reference sites additionally previous studies have found that 65 of pp was microbially derived noe and childers 2007 supporting this positive relationship between tpo and bacterial biomarkers which further indicates that microbial p cycling should be investigated further within treatment wetlands a principal component analysis of the amino acid pigment and lignin biomarkers fig 3 allowed us to further investigate unique characteristics of water column processes between sites from top right to bottom left om shows progressive decay along soil profiles from the plant endmember to soils described further in section 1 4 1 however pom samples clustered away from all other om pools including endmembers which was largely driven by greater concentrations of alloxanthin fucoxanthin p hydroxy phenols pad and pon and tyrosine the only site whose pom did not show this relationship was the eav inflow site likely due to the influence of dense eav which suppresses water column gross primary production grimshaw and wetzel 1997 noe et al 2001 and subsequently limits o2 availability and decreases c turnover hagerthey et al 2010 the eav inflow was also particle dominated with greater tss and poc relative to other sites due to litter contributions from dense stands of typha spp while the rest of the sites had low tss and poc which has been documented for much of the freshwater everglades childers 2006 to investigate dom composition with a less targeted but higher resolution approach we used high resolution mass spectrometry to evaluate differences in water column dom between wetland types dom characterization using ft icr ms enabled molecular level understanding of thousands of observed features with both known and unknown compounds however ft icr ms is not capable of separating structural isomers sleighter and hatcher 2008 as such compounds with the same exact mass but different structures and thus potentially different lability may be falsely classified into the same compound group zark and dittmar 2018 proposed that isomer diversity is related to the degradation state of dom and some compounds may have up to 100 different isomers based on a central limit theorem using im qtof ms lu et al 2018 observed about 10 of detected compounds have 1 to 4 isomers our esi data from im qtof ms showed similar isomer proportions 3 9 7 4 with some of the unique masses accounting for up to 5 isomers interestingly the greatest percentage of masses with isomers in esi was seen in the intermediate and unimpacted reference sites 6 4 and 7 4 respectively which warrants further investigation into microbial turnover of dom in this system and its relationship to isomer abundance however the esi data suggested less than 1 of the observed unique masses have isomers table s5 esi preferentially ionizes basic functional groups while esi preferentially ionize dom moiety containing acidic functional groups such as the carboxylic groups kujawinski 2002 the different proportion of detected features with isomers under the two ionization methods may provide clues to compound lability and transformations for instance observations in esi ft icr ms suggested preferential oxidation of phenolics compounds which may explain the lack of isomers observed in esi during microbial oxidation of aromatic compounds the isomers are likely phenolic compounds with different substitution positions ortho meta and para which isomeric difference is not detectable in the current ion mobility resolution the combination of ft icr ms and im qtof ms combine an unprecedented mass resolution and ability to examine isomeric diversity of dom lastly the averaged elemental ratios of the sav outflow had higher o c and lower h c than the rest of the sites fig s3 suggesting higher oxidation of predominately phenolic compounds e g lignins or tannins possibly due to high biological turnover at these sites when comparing dop characteristics across all sites we observed that most of the lipids and protein like dop were unique to sav sites fig 6 supporting other biomarkers in this study that indicate that the sav sites are characterized by fresh recent om production within their water columns although the most abundant mass range was the same 300 400 da between dop and the total dom pool fig s2 the dop pool had a more limited range of masses suggesting that smaller molecules possibly biologically derived may be contributing to dop within the system additionally im qtof ms information suggested that much of the higher molecular weight dop 500 da such as phospho proteins have at least two isomers which warrants further investigation into the isomeric diversity and bioavailability of dop in this system 3 conclusions the biomarkers studied here tracked the degradation and sources of om within shallow water wetlands and highlighted linkages between bacterial indicators and less degraded i e fresh om within water columns amino acid biomarkers were particularly informative as indicators of degradation while pigments were most useful for evaluating the structure of photosynthetic taxa additionally the unique signatures of pom relative to other sample types suggests that water column processes differ for each wetland type as has been seen in other regions of the everglades hagerthey et al 2010 we found that dense typha stands fundamentally alter om inputs and photosynthetic communities resulting in altered taxa more degraded pigment profiles and a greater number of aromatic features detected by high resolution mass spectrometry sites dominated by sav had less degraded amino acid inputs largely dominated by algal and microbial sources with dom distinguished by lipids and proteins suggesting high biological activity within sav water columns reference sites had the least degraded pigment profiles driven by mixed communities of cyanobacteria diatoms and cryptomonads the strong relationship between the amino acid di and bacterial biomarkers highlights the importance of microbial om turnover in shallow water wetlands hagerthey et al 2010 and the importance of bacterial p cycling white and reddy 2000 wright and reddy 2001 overall these findings indicate that this suite of biomarkers are a refined tool to investigate om dynamics within shallow water wetlands to provide a comprehensive perspective on the source quality and diversity of om and the role that photosynthetic and microbial communities play in the cycling of om in shallow water wetlands declaration of competing interest the authors

18419,membrane fouling or flux limitation is the major bottleneck that hinders anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr application an anmbr with a working volume of 15 l was operated for 180 days to investigate the maximum sustainable flux at different high solid concentrations during the anaerobic treatment of food waste a total of eight filtration to relaxation f r ratios were incorporated with a fixed filtration time of 3 min and varied relaxation times decreased from 12 to 1 min besides a total of five instantaneous fluxes were applied 12 14 16 18 and 20 l m2 h lmh results showed that sustainable flux was greatly enhanced by filtration mode optimization the optimal f r ratios were 3 1 3 1 3 1 and 3 6 at mixed liquor total solid mlts concentrations of 10 15 20 and 25 g l respectively the corresponding sustainable flux values were 13 2 0 3 10 1 0 4 9 3 0 2 and 4 0 0 3 lmh respectively these values were 29 35 52 and 21 higher than the critical flux determined by the flux stepping technique the results of this study were used to perform a mathematical simulation the obtained regression equation between the maximum sustainable flux and mlts concentration can be used to predict the sustainable flux at other mlts concentrations this work provides valuable insight into the design and operation of high solid anmbrs and is expected to contribute to further advances in the application of anmbrs in industry graphical abstract image 1 keywords anmbr food waste high solid anaerobic digestion filtration mode sustainable flux filtration to relaxation ratio 1 introduction over the last decade the anaerobic membrane bioreactor has been the focus of increasingly more research in the treatment of a variety of wastewaters this particular bioreactor has distinct advantages over the conventional high rate anaerobic reactor and aerobic membrane bioreactor including efficient organic carbon capture in the form of methane li et al 2015 complete sludge retention excellent effluent quality dereli et al 2018 and low energy consumption aslam et al 2017 before 2015 70 of all of the anmbrs reported in the literature were being used for the treatment of low strength synthetic wastewater at the lab scale while a definite scale up from lab to pilot plant has occurred for the treatment of real wastewater in the wake of the success of lab studies most of these anmbrs are being used to treat low strength wastewater chen et al 2018 shin and bae 2017 in theory the anmbr is more suitable to treat high strength wastewater due to the prolonged sludge retention time srt therefore more and more researchers are attempting to use anmbrs for the treatment of organic solid wastes chen et al 2019 cheng et al 2018 wandera et al 2018 as the influent concentration increased the total solid concentration in the anmbr increased accordingly although some anmbrs were successfully operated at high solid concentrations the average flux was found to be particularly low methods for enhancing flux at high solid concentrations which is necessary to maintain a safe and sustainable anmbr operation are therefore urgently required flux decline especially over long term operation is the most critical constraint for the applicability and feasibility of the anmbr in wastewater treatment because of the dominant role it plays in determining the membrane area required flux decline mainly results from the continuous accumulation adhesion or deposition of sludge flocs bacterial clusters and or biopolymers on the membrane surface flux decline can also be caused by such organic macro molecules as soluble microbial products smp extracellular polymeric substances eps and possibly other substances either released during cell lysis or excreted wang et al 2008 these macro molecules accumulate and or adhere to the membrane surface or internal pore walls through van der waals and electrostatic double layer force she et al 2016 to mitigate membrane fouling and maintain a sustainable operation membrane processes typically operate below the critical flux fox and stuckey 2015 the critical flux was defined by field et al as the flux below which a decline of flux with time does not occur and above it fouling is observed field et al 1995 however increases in tmp transmembrane pressure over time have been reported even at a very low flux wang et al 2008 this has led to the concept of sustainable flux a flux value below which operation of the membrane system will generate much slower fouling rates that are sustainable in real practice and provide a compromise between captical expenditure and operation cost field and pearce 2011 to increase sustainable flux and control membrane fouling different investigations have been carried out including optimizing biogas sparging strategy zhang et al 2017 b adding adsorbents flocculants or bio carriers liu et al 2019 liu et al 2018 chen et al 2017a zhang et al 2017 a combining coagulation and ultrafiltration or electrocoagulation and filtration as pretreatment li et al 2016 han et al 2015 and employing rotation and vibration bagheri and mirbagheri 2018 relaxation defined as the temporary cessation or pausing of the membrane filtration allows the back transport of foulants away from the membrane surface and permits some flux recovery to maintain a certain average flux or permeate production a higher instantaneous flux is usually applied to compensate for the loss of permeate caused by relaxation maqbool et al investigated the effects of filtration mode on membrane fouling behavior in aerobic membrane bioreactor maqbool et al 2014 their results demonstrated that a lower filtration to relaxation ratio and a higher relaxation frequency slowed the fouling rate however as the relaxation phase is associated with a stop in permeate production an unnecessarily long relaxation time or a high relaxation frequency results in lower permeate production wu et al found that the instantaneous flux applied to compensate for the loss of permeate production during relaxation periods was the major factor affecting the fouling rate wu et al 2008 therefore the optimization of the membrane filtration mode including both the f r ratio and instantaneous flux is required to achieve a high sustainable flux the mlts concentration which determines the viscosity of the sludge affects membrane fouling directly by impacting the formation of the cake layer in a study by meng et al it was found that the membrane fouling resistance increased exponentially with increasing mixed liquor suspended solid mlss concentration meng et al 2007 similarly damayanti et al 2011 found that at the mlss concentration of 20 g l the critical flux was about four times lower than that for an mlss concentration of 5 g l however mahmoud and liao 2017 observed that the critical flux decreased with increasing mixed liquor total suspended solids mlts concentration in the range 5 7 10 6 g l after which it remained almost flat until the mlts concentration reached 15 0 g l mixed liquor solid concentration and flux are two of the most critical parameters influencing membrane fouling and a sustainable operation of the anmbr to our knowledge there is no reported research on optimizing the f r ratio and instantaneous flux at different mlts concentrations to enhance sustainable flux by long term continuous experiment moreover the relationship between sustainable flux and the mlts concentration in anmbr systems has not been investigated with an estimated 27 of the total food production becoming food waste fw it can only be considered a serious global problem this food waste however has strong potential to be utilized for bioenergy conversion the main challenge in bioenergy conversion by conventional anaerobic digestion is the low conversion efficiency ma et al 2018 ye et al 2018 in our study an anmbr was used in the treatment of fw to improve bioenergy conversion while the high total solid content in fw suggests it is sensible to opt for a high solid anmbr further investigation is required to determine how to achieve a high sustainable flux and to limit membrane fouling at such a high mlts concentration given these challenges and demands the objectives of this study are as follows 1 investigate anmbr performance in fw treatment at different mlts concentrations 2 enhance sustainable flux by optimizing filtration mode and compare the results with those for critical flux 3 determine the optimal f r ratio and instantaneous flux at different mlts concentrations and 4 determine the relationship between the optimal sustainable flux and mlts concentration the outcomes of this study are expected to make it possible to predict the required conditions the f r ratio and instantaneous flux for a sustainable operation at all mlts concentrations and to provide valuable insight into the design and operation of anmbrs 2 material and methods 2 1 anmbr system design and operation a hollow fiber type anmbr was used in this study the schematic diagram is shown in fig 1 the anmbr is a vacuum driven submerged membrane bioreactor which consists of a completely stirred tank reactor cstr and a separated membrane chamber the membrane is made of polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe with a mean pore size of 0 1 μm and an effective filtration area of 0 1 m2 sumitomo electric japan a diaphragm pump was used to recirculate biogas from the headspace of the cstr to the bottom of the membrane chamber in order to limit membrane fouling a sparging rate of 4 l per minute cross flow gas velocity 84 9 m3 m2 h was applied three peristaltic pumps were used to feed substrate from the substrate tank to the cstr to recycle the mixed liquor from the cstr to the membrane chamber and to extract permeate from the membrane chamber an altitude difference was applied between the membrane chamber and the cstr so that mixed liquor in the membrane chamber can automatically return to the cstr a gas meter was used to record biogas production cooling and heating devices were applied to control the temperature a pressure sensor and an online tmp analyzer were installed nr 5000 keyence co japan to help track membrane fouling 2 2 feedstock and inoculum the substrate used in this study was fw which contained staple waste meat waste fruit waste and vegetable waste the detailed composition of fw is shown in table s1 the fw was first ground and homogenized to a size less than 5 mm and then was diluted with tap water at fw water mass ratio of 1 3 to make fw slurry the detailed information can be found in our earlier publication cheng et al 2018 the characteristics of the fw slurry are shown in table 1 the seed sludge was taken from a mesophilic sewage sludge digester in a municipal sewage treatment plant in sendai japan the seed sludge was acclimated with fw slurry in a cstr for three months before used 2 3 how to divide the four stages the adjustment of mlts concentrations the experiment was divided into four stages based on mlts concentrations namely mlts concentration at 25 20 15 and 10 g l stage ⅰ ⅱ ⅲ and ⅳ the first stage was the original concentration of 25 g l the second stage was from 25 to 20 g l the third stage was from 20 to 15 g l and the fourth stage was from 15 to 10 g l different amounts of sludge were discharged during the mlts adjustment periods and the same amounts of tap water were added to maintain the same mixed liquor volume in the anmbr the volume of the discharged sludge was calculated by the formula 1 1 c i 1 v r e a c t o r c i v r e a c t o r v d i s c h a r g e d where c i is the mlts concentration in stage i c i 1 is the mlts concentration in stage i 1 v r e a c t o r is the volume of the reactor 15 l v d i s c h a r g e d is the volume of the discharged sludge for example from stage ⅰ to ⅱ c i is 25 g l c i 1 is 20 g l v d i s c h a r g e d is equal to 15 20 15 25 l that is 3 l the purpose of immediately discharging sludge not by changing the srt to decrease mlts concentration to the desired values was to minimize changes in the sludge properties because it has been reported that adjustment of mlts concentration by controlling srt resulted in the changes of other sludge properties such as extracellular polymeric substances particle size distributions and surface charge zamorano lópez et al 2019 also because the long term continuous experiment was used to minimize changes in other properties approximately two weeks were required to adjust the mlts concentration between each stage to ensure that the biomass in the anmbr was in the stable state 2 4 determination of critical fluxes the critical flux of each mlts concentration 10 15 20 and 25 g l was estimated via a flux stepping technique at a constant biogas sparging rate of 4 l per minute the threshold flux a flux beyond which membrane fouling rate is rapid was measured at the same time the permeate flux was increased stepwise every 15 min with a flux step size of 1 3 lmh without relaxation the tmp at each flux step was monitored by the online analyzer every second the average tmp tmp avg of each step was analyzed to estimate the critical and threshold fluxes at different mlts concentrations 2 5 filtration mode optimization the filtration mode optimization experiment was carried out according to table 4 firstly at a fixed instantaneous flux of 12 0 8 lmh eight f r ratios 3 12 3 9 3 6 3 5 3 4 3 3 3 2 and 3 1 were applied by decreasing the relaxation time from 12 to 1 min the tmp and flux were monitored and the resistance was calculated at all f r ratios to determine the optimal f r ratio when the f r ratio increased to 3 1 a filtration mode optimization experiment was carried out by increasing instantaneous flux from 12 0 8 to 20 1 3 lmh stepwise at a 2 lmh interval with the aim of increasing the average flux the resistance r t was calculated by the formula 2 2 r t tmp μ j where tmp is the transmembrane pressure kpa μ is the permeate viscosity pa s j is the flux lmh the instantaneous flux j inst was calculated by the formula 3 3 j inst 1 a dv d t where a is the area of membrane 0 1 m2 v is the filtrate volume l t is the filtration time h the average flux j avg was calculated by the formula 4 4 j avg j inst f i l t r a t i o n t i m e f i l t r a t i o n t i m e r e l a x a t i o n t i m e where j avg is the average flux of a whole cycle including filtration phase and relaxation phase j inst is the instantaneous flux applied during filtration phase for example when the instantaneous flux is 12 lmh the f r ratio is 3 1 the average flux is equal to 12 3 3 1 lmh that is 9 lmh the maximum sustainable flux is defined as the maximum average flux under sustainable operation 2 6 particle size distribution analysis particle size was analyzed using the laser diffraction particle size analyzer mastersizer 3000 malvern instruments ltd uk with a detection range of 0 01 4000 μm five measurements of each sample were taken and the average result was reported 2 7 other analysis methods the compositions of biogas were measured daily by a gas chromatography shimadzu gc 8a measurement of cod mlts mlss mixed liquor volatile solid mlvs and mixed liquor volatile suspended solid mlvss followed the standard methods apha 1985 samples were taken from the sampling points of the anmbr and analyzed twice every week the ph was measured by a ph meter hm 30 r dkk toa co carbohydrate and protein were analyzed using the phenol sulfate examination method and folin phenol method respectively both smp and eps were extracted from mixed liquor according to an earlier study chen et al 2017b and then they were measured as carbohydrate and protein the removal efficiency ra for organic matters were defined by eq 5 5 ra c a i n f c a e f f c a i n f 100 where c a inf is the concentration of organic matter a in the influent and c a eff is the concentration of organic matter a in the effluent 3 results and discussion 3 1 anmbr performance high solid anaerobic digestion refers to an mlts concentration of more than 10 w w or 10 g l however critical flux is very low when mlts concentration exceeds 25 g l zhao et al 2019 giménez et al 2011 therefore we aimed to optimize the membrane filtration mode within an mlts range of 10 25 g l a high strength fw slurry with a total solid concentration of 45 13 1 02 g l and an cod concentration of 73 67 3 10 g l was used in this study the organic loading rate olr was 2 43 0 49 g cod l d and the corresponding hrt was 30 days the whole experiment was divided into four stages with mlts concentration averaged at 25 20 15 and 10 g l stage ⅰ ⅱ ⅲ and ⅳ the corresponding mlvs mlss and mlvss are shown in table 2 as mentioned in section 2 3 to adjust the mlts from 25 to 20 g l 20 to 15 g l and 15 to 10 g l different amounts of sludge were discharged during the mlts adjustment period light red rectangular area in fig 2 in addition to the mlts adjustment between each mlts stage membrane cleaning was carried out to ensure that the membrane was clean before being used in the next stage biogas production system stability and effluent quality were all evaluated by measuring the biogas production rate biogas composition h2s concentration ph ammonia concentration alkalinity organic matter removal efficiency and organic matter concentration in the effluent in this study the smp eps and the particle size distribution of the mixed liquor were also analyzed it can be seen clearly from fig 2 and table 3 that the biogas production rate was steady at 1 27 0 14 l l reactor d with a stable composition methane at 60 83 1 29 and carbon dioxide at 37 96 1 27 throughout the long term continuous experiment the methane yield maintained a value of more than 0 312 0 010 l ch4 g cod re and reached 0 322 0 010 l ch4 g cod re which approached the theoretical value of 0 350 l ch4 g cod the specific production of smp and eps expressed by carbohydrate and protein per gram mlvss is shown in fig s1 as shown both the smp and eps concentration decreased with the decrease in the mlts concentration this was attributed to the reduced concentration of biomass less eps and smp were produced as the mlts concentration decreased it should be noted that the concentration of eps was much higher than that of smp at each mlts concentration the higher eps concentration was due to its colloidal state which make it easily to be intercepted by membrane while smp in its soluble state is membrane permeable particle size distributions of the mixed liquor at different stages were also analyzed and shown in fig s2 the particle size of the mixed liquor was in the range of 1 1000 μm with a predominant peak in the range of 10 100 μm there was almost no change in particle size distribution with the decrease of mlts concentration this result indicates that the decrease of mlts concentration by discharging the sludge rather than changing the srt indeed limited changes in other properties the ph alkalinity vfa and ammonia concentration in the digester are the four most important factors affecting methanogens activity and system stability in anaerobic digestion the ammonia concentration decreased from 1256 30 1127 49 980 37 mg l to 840 39 mg l with the decrease of mlts from 24 64 1 61 20 61 1 17 15 45 1 94 g l to 10 81 0 90 g l ph in the reactor maintained at 7 4 0 2 which was within the favorable ph range 6 6 7 6 for methane production the alkalinity was sufficient and was maintained in the range of 2987 4860 mg caco3 l no vfa accumulation was observed with the total vfa concentration at less than 175 mg ch3cooh l throughout the experiment these parameters indicated that high system stability was achieved in the anaerobic treatment of fw by using the anmbr moreover super effluent quality was harvest in this study with a low cod concentration at 430 40 mg l the cod removal efficiency was as high as 99 45 0 16 the biogas production rate and cod removal efficiency were much higher in this study than that reported in other studies alghoul et al 2019 kobayashi and li 2011 the higher performance of the high solid anmbr can be attributed to a series of factors since the membrane prevented the washout of slow growing methanogens and completely retained organic solids a higher methane production efficiency and high effluent quality were achieved besides a suitable ph environment and sufficient buffering capacity promoted the metabolism of methanogens thereby increasing biogas production rate in summary a high solid anaerobic digestion of fw was achieved by the anmbr and good system stability and reactor performance were obtained indicating that anaerobic digestion by using a high solid anmbr is an efficient method for fw treatment 3 2 critical fluxes determination critical fluxes at mlts concentrations of 25 20 15 and 10 g l were evaluated using the flux stepping protocol and the results are shown in fig 3 1 the tmp shown in fig 3 2 is the arithmetic mean of all the tmp values recorded over each constant flux interval tmp as a function of flux was used to determine the critical and threshold values as shown in fig 3 2 three linear regressions were drawn through the tmp values green line yellow line and red line consider 15 g mlts l as an example as shown in fig 3 2 c when the flux was in range of 2 7 lmh line i green line represents the tmp flux relationship corresponding to a slow fouling rate where long term sustainable operation is possible when the flux was in the range of 7 11 lmh tmp values deviated from the green line the slope of the tmp vs flux curve became steeper where the tmp values are on regression line ii yellow line when the flux was higher than 11 lmh the slope of the tmp vs flux curve was the steepest indicating the rapid fouling rate where line iii red line was drawn the intersections of such linear regressions where the slopes of regressions change correspond to the critical and threshold fluxes miller et al 2014 here the intersection of the green line and yellow line was identified as the critical flux and the intersection of the yellow line and red line was the threshold flux the intersections of the three linear regressions were at 7 5 0 4 and 10 9 0 5 lmh corresponding to the critical and threshold flux respectively the same method was used to measure the critical and threshold fluxes at mlts concentrations of 25 20 and 10 g l as shown in fig 3 2 a and b and d the critical fluxes were 3 3 0 5 6 1 0 2 and 10 2 0 5 lmh respectively the threshold fluxes were 6 1 0 5 9 4 0 5 and 16 8 0 5 lmh respectively the results clearly show that in the range of 10 25 g mlts l the critical flux decreased with increasing mlts concentration however this is not consistent with the observation reported by mahmoud et al who reported that the critical flux decreased with an increase in the mlts concentration in the range 5 7 10 6 g l and then remained flat until 15 0 g l mahmoud and liao 2017 the difference in the results of these two studies is likely due to a combination of the following different feedings fw slurry and synthetic wastewater different mixed liquor characteristics such as particle size distribution and different operation conditions such as the biogas sparging rate 3 3 filtration mode optimization to improve sustainable flux the filtration mode was optimized during the long term continuous experiment a total of eight f r ratios and five instantaneous fluxes were trialed each filtration mode lasted at least 4 h the sustainable filtration modes usually lasted for more than 48 h after each filtration mode membrane was rest and subjected to biogas sparging for 24 h to make sure it is as clean as possible before the next trial the resistance and average flux were calculated at each filtration mode according to formula 2 and 4 respectively the filtration mode optimization experiment was carried out according to table 4 a total of four nine ten and twelve filtration modes were performed at mlts concentrations of 25 20 15 and 10 g l respectively however because there was such a large number of trials and similar flattening trends were found under stable filtration modes rather than present all the data three representative curves are given in fig 4 for each mlts concentration the three representative curves were obtained under a low sustainable flux operation under the maximum sustainable flux operation and under the unsustainable flux operation respectively as shown in the top middle and bottom of each subfigure filtration mode optimization was started from an mlts concentration of 25 g l when the membrane was operated at the f r ratios of 3 12 3 9 and 3 6 the tmp remained stable at 23 71 0 02 kpa as shown in fig 4 a top at an f r ratio of 3 9 f r ratio of 3 12 not shown the average flux kept stable at 3 1 0 03 lmh the resistance was at 9 82 0 08 1012 m the real time tmp curve at this filtration mode is also presented as shown in fig 5 a from the figure it can be seen clearly that 1 both tmpt and tmp0 returned to their starting values after filtration and 2 tmp remained at 2 15 kpa for a long period of time this curve indicates that 1 long term sustainable operation is achievable under this operation because there is no tmp increase and 2 the relaxation time exceeded what was necessary and could be reduced therefore we reduced the relaxation time to 6 min at the same instantaneous flux the average flux accordingly increased to 4 0 0 3 lmh as shown in fig 4 a middle the resistance remained stable at 1 02 0 01 1013 m the steady tmp average flux and the resistance demonstrated that the process was sustainable at this filtration mode it should be noted that this average flux value 4 0 0 3 lmh was higher than the critical flux value 3 3 0 5 lmh the membrane was operated at this filtration mode for two weeks and no obvious flux decline and tmp increase were observed in an earlier study xiao et al 2015 applied a higher flux at the same mixed liquor suspended solid concentration in a pilot scale anaerobic membrane bioreactor however they found that the average flux decline rate was as high as 0 63 lmh d and a high clean frequency once every 10 days was required to guarantee the operation this demonstrates the importance of optimizing the filtration mode to achieve the sustainable operation of the anmbr when we further decreased relaxation time to 5 min at the same instantaneous flux though the average flux increased to 4 5 lmh the tmp increased significantly from 22 80 to 34 34 kpa as shown in fig 4 1 a bottom the resistance also increased from 1 02 1013 to 2 47 1013 m as shown in fig 4 2 a bottom these are indications of unsustainable operation based on the tmp average flux and resistance fluctuations the shortest relaxation time should be controlled at 6 min under an instantaneous flux of 12 lmh that is the optimal f r ratio should be 3 6 and the corresponding maximum sustainable flux will be 4 0 0 3 lmh at an mlts concentration of 25 g l mlts concentrations above 25 g l are not recommended because the sustainable flux of 4 0 0 3 lmh is very low making the filtration process unnecessarily expensive the rapid tmp buildup at f r ratio of 3 5 was undoubtedly due to the short relaxation time as shown in the real time tmp curve in fig 5 b neither tmpt nor tmp0 could return to their initial values after several filtration relaxation cycles the increase in tmp0 suggested five minutes was not enough to release all the suction pressure caused by the filtration phase the increase in tmpt was caused by a rise in tmp0 as the same tmp value was required to maintain the instantaneous flux the mechanism of fouling is as follows due to the reduction in the relaxation time the loosely deposited foulants on the membrane surface could not totally detach to the mixed liquor as they do with a more extended relaxation time the immovable foulants result in a reduction in porosity and a compacted cake layer which contribute to a tmp increase and a flux decrease in addition more dissolved organic matter such as smp and free eps become absorbed in the interstices of the immovable foulants during their free paths to the membrane at an increased f r ratio the immovable foulants act as the main building blocks of the cake layer and the dissolved organic matter fills the interstices of the building blocks resulting in a denser cake layer in stage ii the mlts concentration decreased to 20 g l the process was sustainable as the f r ratio increased from 3 12 to 3 1 at an instantaneous flux of 12 0 8 lmh as shown in fig 4 b top when the f r ratio was 3 3 the tmp could maintain at 7 53 0 28 kpa and the resistance remained stable at 3 18 0 08 1012 m the average flux was 6 12 0 13 lmh approaching the critical flux value when the f r ratio further increased to 3 1 as shown in fig 4 b middle the average flux increased to 9 3 0 2 lmh which reached the threshold flux the tmp and the resistance remained stable at 10 49 0 25 kpa and 4 38 0 10 1012 m respectively indicating that the operation was sustainable in order to further increase average flux the instantaneous flux was increased to 14 lmh at an f r ratio of 3 1 it is clear from fig 4 b bottom that the tmp increased sharply from 22 11 to 25 20 kpa accompanied by a decrease in instantaneous flux from 14 0 to 12 4 lmh within 240 min indicating that the operation was unstable these filtration mode optimization results demonstrated that the optimal filtration mode was at an f r ratio of 3 1 and instantaneous flux of 12 0 8 lmh at an mlts concentration of 20 g l the corresponding maximum sustainable flux was 9 3 0 2 lmh although gimenez et al 2011 obtained a little higher flux of 10 lmh at an mlts concentration of 22 g l their membrane operation mode was rather complex including filtration relaxation back flushing degasification and ventilation this operation mode is not commonly used due to the higher energy consumption and operation cost the results of the filtration mode optimization at mlts concentrations of 15 and 10 g l are shown in fig 4 c and d as shown in fig 4 c middle and d middle the optimal f r ratio was found to be 3 1 for both mlts concentrations and the maximum instantaneous fluxes were 14 1 1 and 18 1 3 lmh respectively the corresponding maximum average fluxes or sustainable fluxes were 10 1 0 4 and 13 2 0 3 lmh respectively which were much higher than their critical fluxes one study applied a much lower permeate flux 3 44 lmh at the same mlts concentration in a spiral symmetry stream anmbr to maintain a sustainable operation chen et al 2017c a higher flux could be applied to their anmbr based on our filtration mode optimization results this would have the benefits of greatly reducing the required membrane area and further decreasing the operation cost it should be noted that at an mlts concentration of 10 g l the unsustainable operation under f r ratio of 3 1 and instantaneous flux of 20 lmh fig 4 d bottom was due to the higher instantaneous flux rather than the insufficient relaxation time which can be explained by the real time tmp curve as shown in fig 5 c despite the gradual increase in the tmpt the tmp0 was able to recover the recovered tmp0 indicated that 1 min was enough to release the suction pressure the increased tmpt was attributed to extortionate instantaneous flux due to the higher tmp required to sustain the extortionate flux when membrane fouling formed three typical membrane filtration processes were revealed in this study 1 a sustainable process 2 an unsustainable process caused by insufficient relaxation time and 3 an unsustainable process caused by extortionate instantaneous flux these were vividly illustrated by the real time tmp curves the sustainable process was characterized by the stable value in both tmpt and tmp0 with filtration time as shown in fig 5 a the unsustainable process caused by insufficient relaxation time shows an increased tendency in both tmpt and tmp0 as a function of time shown fig 5 b while the other unsustainable process caused by extortionate instantaneous flux is illustrated by the gradually increased tmpt but recoverable tmp0 as shown in fig 5 c in summary by optimizing the filtration mode the maximum sustainable fluxes reached 13 2 0 3 10 1 0 4 9 3 0 2 and 4 0 0 3 lmh at mlts concentrations of 10 15 20 and 25 g l respectively a mathematical simulation of the relationship between flux and the mlts concentration revealed a regression equation between maximum sustainable flux and the mlts concentration and a regression equation between critical flux and the mlts concentration these are shown in fig 6 the regression equation y 2 84 x 16 25 y is maximum sustainable flux x is the mlts concentration was established with a high determination coefficient r2 0 9197 the high determination coefficient indicates that the regression model developed to explain the experimental data is highly reliable the linear regression equation was tested to predict the sustainable flux at other solid concentrations in our study and the results were consistent with the real measured values it has been shown in an earlier study that the lab scale reactor can be used independently to check sludge filterability and membrane condition in full scale mbr systems and the optimal relaxation time for large scale mbr can be determined by lab scale systems christensen et al 2016 by combining the results of this study and those of this earlier research it is expected that the regression equation will be fully capable of determining the maximum sustainable flux for full scale anmbrs and serve as a reference for anmbrs design and operation by optimizing the filtration mode the sustainable fluxes increased 21 52 35 and 29 at mlts concentrations of 25 20 15 and 10 g l compared with the critical fluxes the enhanced sustainable fluxes can be explained by the following mechanism firstly the back transport of foulants from membrane surface to mixed liquor is enhanced with intermittent relaxation due to the transmembrane suction pressure release the motion of sludge flocs towards membrane surface or mixed liquor is mainly controlled by two opposite forces permeation drag force and back transport force shen et al 2015 as shown in fig 7 a when a membrane is working under the continuous filtration mode the permeation drag force is much stronger than the back transport force microbial flocs biopolymer compounds and dissolved organic matter move toward the membrane and deposit on the membrane surface from the beginning of filtration blocking the membrane pores or forming cake layer as a result the tmp gradually increases or even become more significant over time as portrayed in fig 8 a compared with the continuous filtration mode the temporary pausing of the filtration under the intermittent filtration mode allows the back transport of sludge flocs away from the membrane surface to the mixed liquor due to transmembrane suction pressure release and concentration gradient zhang et al 2015 maqbool et al 2014 as shown in fig 7 b secondly the effectiveness of the shear force is greatly enhanced in the absence of transmembrane suction pressure the shear force generated by biogas scouring was found to enhance the detachment and the re dispersion of foulants cui et al 2003 the increased effectiveness can improve shear introduced diffusion inertial lift and brownian diffusion lin et al 2014 meng et al 2007 resulting in a high removal of foulants from membrane and mitigating membrane fouling as a result of these favorable factors the tmp value was much lower with intermittent relaxation as shown in fig 8 b the fouling rate was reduced and the sustainable flux was improved with the decrease of mlts concentration from 25 20 15 to 10 g l the optimal sustainable flux increased from 4 0 0 3 9 3 0 2 10 1 0 4 to 13 2 0 3 lmh this observation demonstrated that to maintain a high sustainable flux controlling the maximal mlts concentration at around 20 g l in the anaerobic digestion of fw is desirable the enhanced sustainable flux is evidence of significant fouling control by membrane filtration mode optimization this helps to reduce membrane area decrease cleaning frequency and extend the lifespan of the membrane 4 conclusion membrane fouling or flux limitation is the impediment restricting the application and population of the anmbr to enhance the sustainable flux the filtration mode was optimized at different mlts concentrations this work is the first of its kind to explore the optimal filtration mode at high mlts concentrations by long term continuous experiment and link the maximum sustainable flux with mlts concentration the following conclusions can be derived from this study 1 by optimizing the filtration mode sustainable flux values were found to improved by 29 35 52 and 21 compared to the critical flux value at mlts concentrations of 10 15 20 and 25 g l respectively 2 the optimal f r ratios were 3 1 3 1 3 1 and 3 6 and the corresponding maximum sustainable flux increased to 13 2 0 3 10 1 0 4 9 3 0 2 and 4 0 0 3 lmh at mlts concentrations of 10 15 20 and 25 g l respectively 3 the maximal mlts concentration was suggested to be at around 20 g l to maintain a high sustainable flux during anaerobic digestion of fw 4 the obtained regression equation between the maximum sustainable flux and mlts concentration can be used to predict the sustainable flux at other mlts concentrations which can serve as a reference for full scale anmbr design

18419,membrane fouling or flux limitation is the major bottleneck that hinders anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr application an anmbr with a working volume of 15 l was operated for 180 days to investigate the maximum sustainable flux at different high solid concentrations during the anaerobic treatment of food waste a total of eight filtration to relaxation f r ratios were incorporated with a fixed filtration time of 3 min and varied relaxation times decreased from 12 to 1 min besides a total of five instantaneous fluxes were applied 12 14 16 18 and 20 l m2 h lmh results showed that sustainable flux was greatly enhanced by filtration mode optimization the optimal f r ratios were 3 1 3 1 3 1 and 3 6 at mixed liquor total solid mlts concentrations of 10 15 20 and 25 g l respectively the corresponding sustainable flux values were 13 2 0 3 10 1 0 4 9 3 0 2 and 4 0 0 3 lmh respectively these values were 29 35 52 and 21 higher than the critical flux determined by the flux stepping technique the results of this study were used to perform a mathematical simulation the obtained regression equation between the maximum sustainable flux and mlts concentration can be used to predict the sustainable flux at other mlts concentrations this work provides valuable insight into the design and operation of high solid anmbrs and is expected to contribute to further advances in the application of anmbrs in industry graphical abstract image 1 keywords anmbr food waste high solid anaerobic digestion filtration mode sustainable flux filtration to relaxation ratio 1 introduction over the last decade the anaerobic membrane bioreactor has been the focus of increasingly more research in the treatment of a variety of wastewaters this particular bioreactor has distinct advantages over the conventional high rate anaerobic reactor and aerobic membrane bioreactor including efficient organic carbon capture in the form of methane li et al 2015 complete sludge retention excellent effluent quality dereli et al 2018 and low energy consumption aslam et al 2017 before 2015 70 of all of the anmbrs reported in the literature were being used for the treatment of low strength synthetic wastewater at the lab scale while a definite scale up from lab to pilot plant has occurred for the treatment of real wastewater in the wake of the success of lab studies most of these anmbrs are being used to treat low strength wastewater chen et al 2018 shin and bae 2017 in theory the anmbr is more suitable to treat high strength wastewater due to the prolonged sludge retention time srt therefore more and more researchers are attempting to use anmbrs for the treatment of organic solid wastes chen et al 2019 cheng et al 2018 wandera et al 2018 as the influent concentration increased the total solid concentration in the anmbr increased accordingly although some anmbrs were successfully operated at high solid concentrations the average flux was found to be particularly low methods for enhancing flux at high solid concentrations which is necessary to maintain a safe and sustainable anmbr operation are therefore urgently required flux decline especially over long term operation is the most critical constraint for the applicability and feasibility of the anmbr in wastewater treatment because of the dominant role it plays in determining the membrane area required flux decline mainly results from the continuous accumulation adhesion or deposition of sludge flocs bacterial clusters and or biopolymers on the membrane surface flux decline can also be caused by such organic macro molecules as soluble microbial products smp extracellular polymeric substances eps and possibly other substances either released during cell lysis or excreted wang et al 2008 these macro molecules accumulate and or adhere to the membrane surface or internal pore walls through van der waals and electrostatic double layer force she et al 2016 to mitigate membrane fouling and maintain a sustainable operation membrane processes typically operate below the critical flux fox and stuckey 2015 the critical flux was defined by field et al as the flux below which a decline of flux with time does not occur and above it fouling is observed field et al 1995 however increases in tmp transmembrane pressure over time have been reported even at a very low flux wang et al 2008 this has led to the concept of sustainable flux a flux value below which operation of the membrane system will generate much slower fouling rates that are sustainable in real practice and provide a compromise between captical expenditure and operation cost field and pearce 2011 to increase sustainable flux and control membrane fouling different investigations have been carried out including optimizing biogas sparging strategy zhang et al 2017 b adding adsorbents flocculants or bio carriers liu et al 2019 liu et al 2018 chen et al 2017a zhang et al 2017 a combining coagulation and ultrafiltration or electrocoagulation and filtration as pretreatment li et al 2016 han et al 2015 and employing rotation and vibration bagheri and mirbagheri 2018 relaxation defined as the temporary cessation or pausing of the membrane filtration allows the back transport of foulants away from the membrane surface and permits some flux recovery to maintain a certain average flux or permeate production a higher instantaneous flux is usually applied to compensate for the loss of permeate caused by relaxation maqbool et al investigated the effects of filtration mode on membrane fouling behavior in aerobic membrane bioreactor maqbool et al 2014 their results demonstrated that a lower filtration to relaxation ratio and a higher relaxation frequency slowed the fouling rate however as the relaxation phase is associated with a stop in permeate production an unnecessarily long relaxation time or a high relaxation frequency results in lower permeate production wu et al found that the instantaneous flux applied to compensate for the loss of permeate production during relaxation periods was the major factor affecting the fouling rate wu et al 2008 therefore the optimization of the membrane filtration mode including both the f r ratio and instantaneous flux is required to achieve a high sustainable flux the mlts concentration which determines the viscosity of the sludge affects membrane fouling directly by impacting the formation of the cake layer in a study by meng et al it was found that the membrane fouling resistance increased exponentially with increasing mixed liquor suspended solid mlss concentration meng et al 2007 similarly damayanti et al 2011 found that at the mlss concentration of 20 g l the critical flux was about four times lower than that for an mlss concentration of 5 g l however mahmoud and liao 2017 observed that the critical flux decreased with increasing mixed liquor total suspended solids mlts concentration in the range 5 7 10 6 g l after which it remained almost flat until the mlts concentration reached 15 0 g l mixed liquor solid concentration and flux are two of the most critical parameters influencing membrane fouling and a sustainable operation of the anmbr to our knowledge there is no reported research on optimizing the f r ratio and instantaneous flux at different mlts concentrations to enhance sustainable flux by long term continuous experiment moreover the relationship between sustainable flux and the mlts concentration in anmbr systems has not been investigated with an estimated 27 of the total food production becoming food waste fw it can only be considered a serious global problem this food waste however has strong potential to be utilized for bioenergy conversion the main challenge in bioenergy conversion by conventional anaerobic digestion is the low conversion efficiency ma et al 2018 ye et al 2018 in our study an anmbr was used in the treatment of fw to improve bioenergy conversion while the high total solid content in fw suggests it is sensible to opt for a high solid anmbr further investigation is required to determine how to achieve a high sustainable flux and to limit membrane fouling at such a high mlts concentration given these challenges and demands the objectives of this study are as follows 1 investigate anmbr performance in fw treatment at different mlts concentrations 2 enhance sustainable flux by optimizing filtration mode and compare the results with those for critical flux 3 determine the optimal f r ratio and instantaneous flux at different mlts concentrations and 4 determine the relationship between the optimal sustainable flux and mlts concentration the outcomes of this study are expected to make it possible to predict the required conditions the f r ratio and instantaneous flux for a sustainable operation at all mlts concentrations and to provide valuable insight into the design and operation of anmbrs 2 material and methods 2 1 anmbr system design and operation a hollow fiber type anmbr was used in this study the schematic diagram is shown in fig 1 the anmbr is a vacuum driven submerged membrane bioreactor which consists of a completely stirred tank reactor cstr and a separated membrane chamber the membrane is made of polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe with a mean pore size of 0 1 μm and an effective filtration area of 0 1 m2 sumitomo electric japan a diaphragm pump was used to recirculate biogas from the headspace of the cstr to the bottom of the membrane chamber in order to limit membrane fouling a sparging rate of 4 l per minute cross flow gas velocity 84 9 m3 m2 h was applied three peristaltic pumps were used to feed substrate from the substrate tank to the cstr to recycle the mixed liquor from the cstr to the membrane chamber and to extract permeate from the membrane chamber an altitude difference was applied between the membrane chamber and the cstr so that mixed liquor in the membrane chamber can automatically return to the cstr a gas meter was used to record biogas production cooling and heating devices were applied to control the temperature a pressure sensor and an online tmp analyzer were installed nr 5000 keyence co japan to help track membrane fouling 2 2 feedstock and inoculum the substrate used in this study was fw which contained staple waste meat waste fruit waste and vegetable waste the detailed composition of fw is shown in table s1 the fw was first ground and homogenized to a size less than 5 mm and then was diluted with tap water at fw water mass ratio of 1 3 to make fw slurry the detailed information can be found in our earlier publication cheng et al 2018 the characteristics of the fw slurry are shown in table 1 the seed sludge was taken from a mesophilic sewage sludge digester in a municipal sewage treatment plant in sendai japan the seed sludge was acclimated with fw slurry in a cstr for three months before used 2 3 how to divide the four stages the adjustment of mlts concentrations the experiment was divided into four stages based on mlts concentrations namely mlts concentration at 25 20 15 and 10 g l stage ⅰ ⅱ ⅲ and ⅳ the first stage was the original concentration of 25 g l the second stage was from 25 to 20 g l the third stage was from 20 to 15 g l and the fourth stage was from 15 to 10 g l different amounts of sludge were discharged during the mlts adjustment periods and the same amounts of tap water were added to maintain the same mixed liquor volume in the anmbr the volume of the discharged sludge was calculated by the formula 1 1 c i 1 v r e a c t o r c i v r e a c t o r v d i s c h a r g e d where c i is the mlts concentration in stage i c i 1 is the mlts concentration in stage i 1 v r e a c t o r is the volume of the reactor 15 l v d i s c h a r g e d is the volume of the discharged sludge for example from stage ⅰ to ⅱ c i is 25 g l c i 1 is 20 g l v d i s c h a r g e d is equal to 15 20 15 25 l that is 3 l the purpose of immediately discharging sludge not by changing the srt to decrease mlts concentration to the desired values was to minimize changes in the sludge properties because it has been reported that adjustment of mlts concentration by controlling srt resulted in the changes of other sludge properties such as extracellular polymeric substances particle size distributions and surface charge zamorano lópez et al 2019 also because the long term continuous experiment was used to minimize changes in other properties approximately two weeks were required to adjust the mlts concentration between each stage to ensure that the biomass in the anmbr was in the stable state 2 4 determination of critical fluxes the critical flux of each mlts concentration 10 15 20 and 25 g l was estimated via a flux stepping technique at a constant biogas sparging rate of 4 l per minute the threshold flux a flux beyond which membrane fouling rate is rapid was measured at the same time the permeate flux was increased stepwise every 15 min with a flux step size of 1 3 lmh without relaxation the tmp at each flux step was monitored by the online analyzer every second the average tmp tmp avg of each step was analyzed to estimate the critical and threshold fluxes at different mlts concentrations 2 5 filtration mode optimization the filtration mode optimization experiment was carried out according to table 4 firstly at a fixed instantaneous flux of 12 0 8 lmh eight f r ratios 3 12 3 9 3 6 3 5 3 4 3 3 3 2 and 3 1 were applied by decreasing the relaxation time from 12 to 1 min the tmp and flux were monitored and the resistance was calculated at all f r ratios to determine the optimal f r ratio when the f r ratio increased to 3 1 a filtration mode optimization experiment was carried out by increasing instantaneous flux from 12 0 8 to 20 1 3 lmh stepwise at a 2 lmh interval with the aim of increasing the average flux the resistance r t was calculated by the formula 2 2 r t tmp μ j where tmp is the transmembrane pressure kpa μ is the permeate viscosity pa s j is the flux lmh the instantaneous flux j inst was calculated by the formula 3 3 j inst 1 a dv d t where a is the area of membrane 0 1 m2 v is the filtrate volume l t is the filtration time h the average flux j avg was calculated by the formula 4 4 j avg j inst f i l t r a t i o n t i m e f i l t r a t i o n t i m e r e l a x a t i o n t i m e where j avg is the average flux of a whole cycle including filtration phase and relaxation phase j inst is the instantaneous flux applied during filtration phase for example when the instantaneous flux is 12 lmh the f r ratio is 3 1 the average flux is equal to 12 3 3 1 lmh that is 9 lmh the maximum sustainable flux is defined as the maximum average flux under sustainable operation 2 6 particle size distribution analysis particle size was analyzed using the laser diffraction particle size analyzer mastersizer 3000 malvern instruments ltd uk with a detection range of 0 01 4000 μm five measurements of each sample were taken and the average result was reported 2 7 other analysis methods the compositions of biogas were measured daily by a gas chromatography shimadzu gc 8a measurement of cod mlts mlss mixed liquor volatile solid mlvs and mixed liquor volatile suspended solid mlvss followed the standard methods apha 1985 samples were taken from the sampling points of the anmbr and analyzed twice every week the ph was measured by a ph meter hm 30 r dkk toa co carbohydrate and protein were analyzed using the phenol sulfate examination method and folin phenol method respectively both smp and eps were extracted from mixed liquor according to an earlier study chen et al 2017b and then they were measured as carbohydrate and protein the removal efficiency ra for organic matters were defined by eq 5 5 ra c a i n f c a e f f c a i n f 100 where c a inf is the concentration of organic matter a in the influent and c a eff is the concentration of organic matter a in the effluent 3 results and discussion 3 1 anmbr performance high solid anaerobic digestion refers to an mlts concentration of more than 10 w w or 10 g l however critical flux is very low when mlts concentration exceeds 25 g l zhao et al 2019 giménez et al 2011 therefore we aimed to optimize the membrane filtration mode within an mlts range of 10 25 g l a high strength fw slurry with a total solid concentration of 45 13 1 02 g l and an cod concentration of 73 67 3 10 g l was used in this study the organic loading rate olr was 2 43 0 49 g cod l d and the corresponding hrt was 30 days the whole experiment was divided into four stages with mlts concentration averaged at 25 20 15 and 10 g l stage ⅰ ⅱ ⅲ and ⅳ the corresponding mlvs mlss and mlvss are shown in table 2 as mentioned in section 2 3 to adjust the mlts from 25 to 20 g l 20 to 15 g l and 15 to 10 g l different amounts of sludge were discharged during the mlts adjustment period light red rectangular area in fig 2 in addition to the mlts adjustment between each mlts stage membrane cleaning was carried out to ensure that the membrane was clean before being used in the next stage biogas production system stability and effluent quality were all evaluated by measuring the biogas production rate biogas composition h2s concentration ph ammonia concentration alkalinity organic matter removal efficiency and organic matter concentration in the effluent in this study the smp eps and the particle size distribution of the mixed liquor were also analyzed it can be seen clearly from fig 2 and table 3 that the biogas production rate was steady at 1 27 0 14 l l reactor d with a stable composition methane at 60 83 1 29 and carbon dioxide at 37 96 1 27 throughout the long term continuous experiment the methane yield maintained a value of more than 0 312 0 010 l ch4 g cod re and reached 0 322 0 010 l ch4 g cod re which approached the theoretical value of 0 350 l ch4 g cod the specific production of smp and eps expressed by carbohydrate and protein per gram mlvss is shown in fig s1 as shown both the smp and eps concentration decreased with the decrease in the mlts concentration this was attributed to the reduced concentration of biomass less eps and smp were produced as the mlts concentration decreased it should be noted that the concentration of eps was much higher than that of smp at each mlts concentration the higher eps concentration was due to its colloidal state which make it easily to be intercepted by membrane while smp in its soluble state is membrane permeable particle size distributions of the mixed liquor at different stages were also analyzed and shown in fig s2 the particle size of the mixed liquor was in the range of 1 1000 μm with a predominant peak in the range of 10 100 μm there was almost no change in particle size distribution with the decrease of mlts concentration this result indicates that the decrease of mlts concentration by discharging the sludge rather than changing the srt indeed limited changes in other properties the ph alkalinity vfa and ammonia concentration in the digester are the four most important factors affecting methanogens activity and system stability in anaerobic digestion the ammonia concentration decreased from 1256 30 1127 49 980 37 mg l to 840 39 mg l with the decrease of mlts from 24 64 1 61 20 61 1 17 15 45 1 94 g l to 10 81 0 90 g l ph in the reactor maintained at 7 4 0 2 which was within the favorable ph range 6 6 7 6 for methane production the alkalinity was sufficient and was maintained in the range of 2987 4860 mg caco3 l no vfa accumulation was observed with the total vfa concentration at less than 175 mg ch3cooh l throughout the experiment these parameters indicated that high system stability was achieved in the anaerobic treatment of fw by using the anmbr moreover super effluent quality was harvest in this study with a low cod concentration at 430 40 mg l the cod removal efficiency was as high as 99 45 0 16 the biogas production rate and cod removal efficiency were much higher in this study than that reported in other studies alghoul et al 2019 kobayashi and li 2011 the higher performance of the high solid anmbr can be attributed to a series of factors since the membrane prevented the washout of slow growing methanogens and completely retained organic solids a higher methane production efficiency and high effluent quality were achieved besides a suitable ph environment and sufficient buffering capacity promoted the metabolism of methanogens thereby increasing biogas production rate in summary a high solid anaerobic digestion of fw was achieved by the anmbr and good system stability and reactor performance were obtained indicating that anaerobic digestion by using a high solid anmbr is an efficient method for fw treatment 3 2 critical fluxes determination critical fluxes at mlts concentrations of 25 20 15 and 10 g l were evaluated using the flux stepping protocol and the results are shown in fig 3 1 the tmp shown in fig 3 2 is the arithmetic mean of all the tmp values recorded over each constant flux interval tmp as a function of flux was used to determine the critical and threshold values as shown in fig 3 2 three linear regressions were drawn through the tmp values green line yellow line and red line consider 15 g mlts l as an example as shown in fig 3 2 c when the flux was in range of 2 7 lmh line i green line represents the tmp flux relationship corresponding to a slow fouling rate where long term sustainable operation is possible when the flux was in the range of 7 11 lmh tmp values deviated from the green line the slope of the tmp vs flux curve became steeper where the tmp values are on regression line ii yellow line when the flux was higher than 11 lmh the slope of the tmp vs flux curve was the steepest indicating the rapid fouling rate where line iii red line was drawn the intersections of such linear regressions where the slopes of regressions change correspond to the critical and threshold fluxes miller et al 2014 here the intersection of the green line and yellow line was identified as the critical flux and the intersection of the yellow line and red line was the threshold flux the intersections of the three linear regressions were at 7 5 0 4 and 10 9 0 5 lmh corresponding to the critical and threshold flux respectively the same method was used to measure the critical and threshold fluxes at mlts concentrations of 25 20 and 10 g l as shown in fig 3 2 a and b and d the critical fluxes were 3 3 0 5 6 1 0 2 and 10 2 0 5 lmh respectively the threshold fluxes were 6 1 0 5 9 4 0 5 and 16 8 0 5 lmh respectively the results clearly show that in the range of 10 25 g mlts l the critical flux decreased with increasing mlts concentration however this is not consistent with the observation reported by mahmoud et al who reported that the critical flux decreased with an increase in the mlts concentration in the range 5 7 10 6 g l and then remained flat until 15 0 g l mahmoud and liao 2017 the difference in the results of these two studies is likely due to a combination of the following different feedings fw slurry and synthetic wastewater different mixed liquor characteristics such as particle size distribution and different operation conditions such as the biogas sparging rate 3 3 filtration mode optimization to improve sustainable flux the filtration mode was optimized during the long term continuous experiment a total of eight f r ratios and five instantaneous fluxes were trialed each filtration mode lasted at least 4 h the sustainable filtration modes usually lasted for more than 48 h after each filtration mode membrane was rest and subjected to biogas sparging for 24 h to make sure it is as clean as possible before the next trial the resistance and average flux were calculated at each filtration mode according to formula 2 and 4 respectively the filtration mode optimization experiment was carried out according to table 4 a total of four nine ten and twelve filtration modes were performed at mlts concentrations of 25 20 15 and 10 g l respectively however because there was such a large number of trials and similar flattening trends were found under stable filtration modes rather than present all the data three representative curves are given in fig 4 for each mlts concentration the three representative curves were obtained under a low sustainable flux operation under the maximum sustainable flux operation and under the unsustainable flux operation respectively as shown in the top middle and bottom of each subfigure filtration mode optimization was started from an mlts concentration of 25 g l when the membrane was operated at the f r ratios of 3 12 3 9 and 3 6 the tmp remained stable at 23 71 0 02 kpa as shown in fig 4 a top at an f r ratio of 3 9 f r ratio of 3 12 not shown the average flux kept stable at 3 1 0 03 lmh the resistance was at 9 82 0 08 1012 m the real time tmp curve at this filtration mode is also presented as shown in fig 5 a from the figure it can be seen clearly that 1 both tmpt and tmp0 returned to their starting values after filtration and 2 tmp remained at 2 15 kpa for a long period of time this curve indicates that 1 long term sustainable operation is achievable under this operation because there is no tmp increase and 2 the relaxation time exceeded what was necessary and could be reduced therefore we reduced the relaxation time to 6 min at the same instantaneous flux the average flux accordingly increased to 4 0 0 3 lmh as shown in fig 4 a middle the resistance remained stable at 1 02 0 01 1013 m the steady tmp average flux and the resistance demonstrated that the process was sustainable at this filtration mode it should be noted that this average flux value 4 0 0 3 lmh was higher than the critical flux value 3 3 0 5 lmh the membrane was operated at this filtration mode for two weeks and no obvious flux decline and tmp increase were observed in an earlier study xiao et al 2015 applied a higher flux at the same mixed liquor suspended solid concentration in a pilot scale anaerobic membrane bioreactor however they found that the average flux decline rate was as high as 0 63 lmh d and a high clean frequency once every 10 days was required to guarantee the operation this demonstrates the importance of optimizing the filtration mode to achieve the sustainable operation of the anmbr when we further decreased relaxation time to 5 min at the same instantaneous flux though the average flux increased to 4 5 lmh the tmp increased significantly from 22 80 to 34 34 kpa as shown in fig 4 1 a bottom the resistance also increased from 1 02 1013 to 2 47 1013 m as shown in fig 4 2 a bottom these are indications of unsustainable operation based on the tmp average flux and resistance fluctuations the shortest relaxation time should be controlled at 6 min under an instantaneous flux of 12 lmh that is the optimal f r ratio should be 3 6 and the corresponding maximum sustainable flux will be 4 0 0 3 lmh at an mlts concentration of 25 g l mlts concentrations above 25 g l are not recommended because the sustainable flux of 4 0 0 3 lmh is very low making the filtration process unnecessarily expensive the rapid tmp buildup at f r ratio of 3 5 was undoubtedly due to the short relaxation time as shown in the real time tmp curve in fig 5 b neither tmpt nor tmp0 could return to their initial values after several filtration relaxation cycles the increase in tmp0 suggested five minutes was not enough to release all the suction pressure caused by the filtration phase the increase in tmpt was caused by a rise in tmp0 as the same tmp value was required to maintain the instantaneous flux the mechanism of fouling is as follows due to the reduction in the relaxation time the loosely deposited foulants on the membrane surface could not totally detach to the mixed liquor as they do with a more extended relaxation time the immovable foulants result in a reduction in porosity and a compacted cake layer which contribute to a tmp increase and a flux decrease in addition more dissolved organic matter such as smp and free eps become absorbed in the interstices of the immovable foulants during their free paths to the membrane at an increased f r ratio the immovable foulants act as the main building blocks of the cake layer and the dissolved organic matter fills the interstices of the building blocks resulting in a denser cake layer in stage ii the mlts concentration decreased to 20 g l the process was sustainable as the f r ratio increased from 3 12 to 3 1 at an instantaneous flux of 12 0 8 lmh as shown in fig 4 b top when the f r ratio was 3 3 the tmp could maintain at 7 53 0 28 kpa and the resistance remained stable at 3 18 0 08 1012 m the average flux was 6 12 0 13 lmh approaching the critical flux value when the f r ratio further increased to 3 1 as shown in fig 4 b middle the average flux increased to 9 3 0 2 lmh which reached the threshold flux the tmp and the resistance remained stable at 10 49 0 25 kpa and 4 38 0 10 1012 m respectively indicating that the operation was sustainable in order to further increase average flux the instantaneous flux was increased to 14 lmh at an f r ratio of 3 1 it is clear from fig 4 b bottom that the tmp increased sharply from 22 11 to 25 20 kpa accompanied by a decrease in instantaneous flux from 14 0 to 12 4 lmh within 240 min indicating that the operation was unstable these filtration mode optimization results demonstrated that the optimal filtration mode was at an f r ratio of 3 1 and instantaneous flux of 12 0 8 lmh at an mlts concentration of 20 g l the corresponding maximum sustainable flux was 9 3 0 2 lmh although gimenez et al 2011 obtained a little higher flux of 10 lmh at an mlts concentration of 22 g l their membrane operation mode was rather complex including filtration relaxation back flushing degasification and ventilation this operation mode is not commonly used due to the higher energy consumption and operation cost the results of the filtration mode optimization at mlts concentrations of 15 and 10 g l are shown in fig 4 c and d as shown in fig 4 c middle and d middle the optimal f r ratio was found to be 3 1 for both mlts concentrations and the maximum instantaneous fluxes were 14 1 1 and 18 1 3 lmh respectively the corresponding maximum average fluxes or sustainable fluxes were 10 1 0 4 and 13 2 0 3 lmh respectively which were much higher than their critical fluxes one study applied a much lower permeate flux 3 44 lmh at the same mlts concentration in a spiral symmetry stream anmbr to maintain a sustainable operation chen et al 2017c a higher flux could be applied to their anmbr based on our filtration mode optimization results this would have the benefits of greatly reducing the required membrane area and further decreasing the operation cost it should be noted that at an mlts concentration of 10 g l the unsustainable operation under f r ratio of 3 1 and instantaneous flux of 20 lmh fig 4 d bottom was due to the higher instantaneous flux rather than the insufficient relaxation time which can be explained by the real time tmp curve as shown in fig 5 c despite the gradual increase in the tmpt the tmp0 was able to recover the recovered tmp0 indicated that 1 min was enough to release the suction pressure the increased tmpt was attributed to extortionate instantaneous flux due to the higher tmp required to sustain the extortionate flux when membrane fouling formed three typical membrane filtration processes were revealed in this study 1 a sustainable process 2 an unsustainable process caused by insufficient relaxation time and 3 an unsustainable process caused by extortionate instantaneous flux these were vividly illustrated by the real time tmp curves the sustainable process was characterized by the stable value in both tmpt and tmp0 with filtration time as shown in fig 5 a the unsustainable process caused by insufficient relaxation time shows an increased tendency in both tmpt and tmp0 as a function of time shown fig 5 b while the other unsustainable process caused by extortionate instantaneous flux is illustrated by the gradually increased tmpt but recoverable tmp0 as shown in fig 5 c in summary by optimizing the filtration mode the maximum sustainable fluxes reached 13 2 0 3 10 1 0 4 9 3 0 2 and 4 0 0 3 lmh at mlts concentrations of 10 15 20 and 25 g l respectively a mathematical simulation of the relationship between flux and the mlts concentration revealed a regression equation between maximum sustainable flux and the mlts concentration and a regression equation between critical flux and the mlts concentration these are shown in fig 6 the regression equation y 2 84 x 16 25 y is maximum sustainable flux x is the mlts concentration was established with a high determination coefficient r2 0 9197 the high determination coefficient indicates that the regression model developed to explain the experimental data is highly reliable the linear regression equation was tested to predict the sustainable flux at other solid concentrations in our study and the results were consistent with the real measured values it has been shown in an earlier study that the lab scale reactor can be used independently to check sludge filterability and membrane condition in full scale mbr systems and the optimal relaxation time for large scale mbr can be determined by lab scale systems christensen et al 2016 by combining the results of this study and those of this earlier research it is expected that the regression equation will be fully capable of determining the maximum sustainable flux for full scale anmbrs and serve as a reference for anmbrs design and operation by optimizing the filtration mode the sustainable fluxes increased 21 52 35 and 29 at mlts concentrations of 25 20 15 and 10 g l compared with the critical fluxes the enhanced sustainable fluxes can be explained by the following mechanism firstly the back transport of foulants from membrane surface to mixed liquor is enhanced with intermittent relaxation due to the transmembrane suction pressure release the motion of sludge flocs towards membrane surface or mixed liquor is mainly controlled by two opposite forces permeation drag force and back transport force shen et al 2015 as shown in fig 7 a when a membrane is working under the continuous filtration mode the permeation drag force is much stronger than the back transport force microbial flocs biopolymer compounds and dissolved organic matter move toward the membrane and deposit on the membrane surface from the beginning of filtration blocking the membrane pores or forming cake layer as a result the tmp gradually increases or even become more significant over time as portrayed in fig 8 a compared with the continuous filtration mode the temporary pausing of the filtration under the intermittent filtration mode allows the back transport of sludge flocs away from the membrane surface to the mixed liquor due to transmembrane suction pressure release and concentration gradient zhang et al 2015 maqbool et al 2014 as shown in fig 7 b secondly the effectiveness of the shear force is greatly enhanced in the absence of transmembrane suction pressure the shear force generated by biogas scouring was found to enhance the detachment and the re dispersion of foulants cui et al 2003 the increased effectiveness can improve shear introduced diffusion inertial lift and brownian diffusion lin et al 2014 meng et al 2007 resulting in a high removal of foulants from membrane and mitigating membrane fouling as a result of these favorable factors the tmp value was much lower with intermittent relaxation as shown in fig 8 b the fouling rate was reduced and the sustainable flux was improved with the decrease of mlts concentration from 25 20 15 to 10 g l the optimal sustainable flux increased from 4 0 0 3 9 3 0 2 10 1 0 4 to 13 2 0 3 lmh this observation demonstrated that to maintain a high sustainable flux controlling the maximal mlts concentration at around 20 g l in the anaerobic digestion of fw is desirable the enhanced sustainable flux is evidence of significant fouling control by membrane filtration mode optimization this helps to reduce membrane area decrease cleaning frequency and extend the lifespan of the membrane 4 conclusion membrane fouling or flux limitation is the impediment restricting the application and population of the anmbr to enhance the sustainable flux the filtration mode was optimized at different mlts concentrations this work is the first of its kind to explore the optimal filtration mode at high mlts concentrations by long term continuous experiment and link the maximum sustainable flux with mlts concentration the following conclusions can be derived from this study 1 by optimizing the filtration mode sustainable flux values were found to improved by 29 35 52 and 21 compared to the critical flux value at mlts concentrations of 10 15 20 and 25 g l respectively 2 the optimal f r ratios were 3 1 3 1 3 1 and 3 6 and the corresponding maximum sustainable flux increased to 13 2 0 3 10 1 0 4 9 3 0 2 and 4 0 0 3 lmh at mlts concentrations of 10 15 20 and 25 g l respectively 3 the maximal mlts concentration was suggested to be at around 20 g l to maintain a high sustainable flux during anaerobic digestion of fw 4 the obtained regression equation between the maximum sustainable flux and mlts concentration can be used to predict the sustainable flux at other mlts concentrations which can serve as a reference for full scale anmbr design
