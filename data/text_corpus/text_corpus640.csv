3200,assessment of hydrological connectivity is a valuable tool for water management it enables various environmental factors related to water mediated transport of matter and energy within or between elements of a system to be identified and incorporated into hydrological models the index of connectivity ic is widely used to quantify hydrological connectivity however it may be influenced by the spatial resolution of the digital elevation model dem which is one of the common inputs as pixel size modifies some basin parameters several dems available on open access platforms with spatial resolutions from 5 to 30 m lidar alos mec aster srtm were compared to identify differences between ic in two basins with contrasting environments site 1 steep slope terrain with warm humid climate and site 2 gentle hill slopes with semi arid climate differences in perimeters were analyzed using glm repeated measures anova while for differences in ic one way anova was used relationships between ic subtracted maps and basin parameters were explored with classification and regression trees cart basin perimeters and ic varied as a function of dem resolution but environmental factors such as relief and land use cover seemed to influence ic maps distance to sinks was one of the variables explaining spatial differences in ic between dems the selection of dem spatial resolution for hydrological connectivity analysis should be based on the characteristics of the study area economic and technological issues and whether the objectives can be met with the available dem resolution keywords hydrological analysis lidar aster srtm alos 1 introduction connectivity refers to the influence of a system s intrinsic organization on its global behavior and how it allows the exchange of matter and energy within and out of such a system antoine et al 2009 pringle 2001 wohl et al 2017 as a ubiquitous process the study of connectivity has attracted interest in geomorphology hydrology geology ecology biology and neuroscience bourgeois et al 2017 keesstra et al 2018 turnbull et al 2018 through this perspective the development of theoretical methodological frameworks in such a diversity of areas of knowledge has stimulated multi and interdisciplinary studies turnbull et al 2018 in hydrology structural connectivity refers to how a system allows or prevents water and sediments transfer within and out of itself which is related to the spatial organization of the elements of the system lexartza artza and wainwright 2009 in addition functional connectivity analyzes the dynamic processes taking place in a structurally connected network turnbull et al 2018 both help us understand and express the complexity of the system s non linear responses related to the balance between water entry by any precipitation type and the consequent production of runoff and sediments lópez vicente and álvarez 2018 for instance hydrological connectivity reveals the continuity of runoff and the routes by which water and sediment move at any given time fryirs 2013 heckmann et al 2018 offers a synthetic approach to analyzing basin responses to global and local changes cantreul et al 2018 and helps to evaluate the effectiveness of ecosystem management strategies puttock et al 2013 wainwright et al 2011 another strength of hydrological connectivity is the simplicity of its measurement through indices that require input data such as topographic variables and land use cover some studies have primarily used a digital elevation model dem from which the rest of the inputs are derived cavalli et al 2013 while others have included dem data and land use cover derived from remotely sensed data kumar et al 2014 martini et al 2019 in any case the common input is a dem as hydrological connectivity indices are closely related to its resolution brardinoni et al 2015 cantreul et al 2018 since pixel size modifies essential parameters such as basin boundary area and perimeter density and length of the drainage network slope and slope direction among other characteristics borselli et al 2008 although dem resolution has been evaluated in the context of hydrological features and models deng et al 2007 kienzle 2004 li et al 2017 sørensen and seibert 2007 wechesler 2007 analysis of its effects on hydrological connectivity is still under development estrany et al 2019 lópez vicente and álvarez 2018 zanandrea et al 2019 previous studies acknowledge that index of connectivity borselli et al 2008 cavalli et al 2013 values rises as the dem pixel size increases since topographic details could act as disconnection or impedance elements that tend to be smoothed by low dem spatial resolutions habtezion et al 2016 lópez vicente and álvarez 2018 in addition it has been found a strong correlation between dem resolution and index of connectivity providing useful insights on these reasons brardinoni et al 2015 cantreul et al 2018 but high resolutions also tend to introduce noise into the hydrological connectivity model lópez vicente and álvarez 2018 high resolution dems entail other challenges such as the availability of information on open access platforms the technological capacity to generate dems the often cost prohibitive access to high resolution data and computational processing requirements cantreul et al 2016 zanandrea et al 2019 therefore the choice of the spatial resolution of the dem will depend on data availability claessens et al 2005 and the visualization needs of the study akbari et al 2009 habtezion et al 2016 suggest that since calculation capacity is usually one of the main limitations a dem spatial resolution on the cm scale may be used for a meter scale area while a meter scale is applicable for a study of a km scale area when the economic and technological resources are limited to acquiring or generating a high resolution dem data from open access platforms constitute an alternative to obtaining elevation data examples of these data include the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster shuttle radar topography mission srtm advanced land observing satellite alos and locally in mexico the mexican elevation continuum mec administered by the national institute of statistics and geography inegi which also supplies lidar data since connectivity is an emergent property of geomorphic systems and contributes to proactive territory management smetanová et al 2018 it is vital to account for differences when assessing hydrological connectivity related to dem spatial resolution yet most of the efforts have focused on the effect of changing pixel size from the same elevation data source brardinoni et al 2015 cantreul et al 2018 habtezion et al 2016 lópez vicente and álvarez 2018 however research regarding the impact of different sources and spatial resolutions on hydrological connectivity or morphometric parameters affecting it e g perimeter is still scarce therefore is essential to assess these dem features from sources available in free access platforms since these data may be the most affordable option in developing countries zanandrea et al 2019 in this sense this study aimed to compare the index of connectivity outputs borselli et al 2008 and basin perimeters computed from different freely available digital elevation models with spatial resolutions ranging from 5 to 30 m in two basins with contrasting environments in central mexico site 1 is located in a warm humid climate environment with steep convergent slopes and spatially homogeneous vegetation distribution site 2 is in a dry temperate climate with gentle divergent slopes and heterogeneous vegetation distribution the selected dem sources were srtm aster alos mexican elevation continuum and lidar the latter is available at no cost for mexico provided by the national institute of statistics and geography we expect the different dem spatial resolutions from the analized sources influence the morphometric and hydrographic basin characteristics that led to different hydrological connectivity patterns if these patterns differ from each other then the characteristics of the basins e g slope slope direction distances to hydrological network terrain curvatures among others that explain the differences in estimated hydrological connectivity had to be identified thus considerations and guidelines for selecting a spatial resolution are proposed for future studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites two basins in san luis potosí mexico located in contrasting natural environments were selected huichihuayán huehuetlán site 1 and cerro de san pedro site 2 fig 1 2 1 1 site 1 huichihuayán huehuetlán site is located in a warm humid region with a relief of rough narrow and elongated tectonic origin resulting from the deformation of mesozoic marine rocks eguiluz de antuñano et al 2000 the intense deformation of rocks favors a high dissection of relief areas of steep slopes and development of karst type landforms padilla y sánchez 2007 the main climate types are warm and semi warm a c m a f am f a c w2 a c fm a c w1 and am garcía 2004 the average annual temperature is between 18 c and 22 c the average annual rainfall ranges from 1200 to 2500 mm reaching 3000 mm in the highest parts of the topography garcía 1998 the humidity gradient descends from e to w the dominant vegetation types comprise tropical oak pine and cloud forests rzedowski 1961 land use includes livestock grazing and sugar cane and citrus cultivation inegi 2019 the land is always covered with either natural or cultivated vegetation which gives a spatially continuous character however areas of bare soil that are agricultural plots in the fallow period disrupt this continuity in some areas 2 1 2 site 2 cerro de san pedro the site is located in a dry temperate zone with a relief type composed of a combination of strongly deformed mesozoic marine rocks and cenozoic volcanic mountain ranges that interrupt the alluvial plains filled by epiclastic deposits borsdorf et al 2004 the climate types are semi arid and arid temperate bs0kw and bs1kw garcía 2004

in the abandonment phase inegi 2019 2 2 digital elevation models for both study sites dems with varying spatial resolutions freely available from online platforms table 1 were selected for the analysis 2 3 study sites and estimation of general metrics from digital elevation models the study sites were delimited in arcgis 10 3 using a flow accumulation threshold of 9 ha which provided enough detail while enabling a reasonable number of basins from an ecohydrological and ecosystem restoration perspective for each site general metrics were computed perimeter km total area km2 total length of the hydrologic network km drainage density km km2 length of the main stream km stream order strahler s method stream length by order km altitudinal range ar slope direction asp slope in degrees sd distance to sinks m euclidean distance to sinks ed and distance following hillslope flow according to slope direction roughness and tortuosity hd additionally plane curvature plc profile curvature prc tangential curvature tgc and relative stream power rsp were computed in terrain analysis system tas version 2 0 9 2 4 hydrological connectivity assessment the index of connectivity values for all the dems were calculated using the sedinconnect 2 3 program developed by crema and cavalli 2018 sedinconnect 2 3 calculates the index of connectivity ic proposed by borselli et al 2008 with the improvements introduced by cavalli et al 2013 the index of connectivity quantitatively expresses the probability that water and sediments are mobilized from a given point pass through a reference point and reach deposition zones also called sinks borselli et al 2008 the operational formula describing this process is as follows 1 i c log 10 w s a d w s the numerator represents the characteristics upslope from a reference point the elements are w average weighting factor related to land use cover s slope in the area contributing to the reference point m m a contributing area m2 the denominator represents the characteristics downslope from the reference point the elements are d distance to sink m w weighting factor related to land use cover in this study roads towns mining areas water bodies and the stream network were considered sinks for computing ic these sinks were common to ic calculations for all dems except stream networks derived from each dem the mining area i e mine pit and tailings dams disrupted hydrological connectivity in the landscape and were considered sinks since there was no outcoming flow 2 4 1 weighting factor w the ic proposed by borselli et al 2008 has been applied to multiple environments for different purposes by adapting the w factor to the particular objectives of each analysis the w factor is related to allowing or inhibiting water and sediment from transferring within the study site and reaching the outlet point the w factor values range from 0 to 1 values close to 0 correspond to features that inhibit or reduce the connectivity while values closer to 1 relate to elements that favor or increase the connectivity given the different spatial arrangement of land use cover in the two study sites the w factor was determined in two ways as explained in the following sections 2 4 1 1 site 1 w factor the c factor values from the universal soil loss equation usle were used as the w factor for each land use cover within the basin supervised classification of an atmospherically corrected landsat satellite image from february 2014 espa cr usgs gov was undertaken by building a classification tree cart in ibm spss statistics 27 faculty pack license the resulting classification tree was implemented and validated in the envi 5 0 program obtaining a classification accuracy of 86 0 the resulting land use cover classes and corresponding w factor values taken from the rusle s c factor were crops w 0 2 oak forest w 0 001 pine forest w 0 001 pasture w 0 003 and evergreen forest w 0 001 values near zero indicate more soil protection by vegetation and thus less connectivity for instance any forest will have lower connectivity compared to a crop 2 4 1 2 site 2 w factor due to the patterned landscape of this semi arid basin the w factor was assigned based on the average runoff coefficient obtained through 120 rainfall simulations undertaken in vegetated patches and inter patches a cornell sprinkle infiltrometer type rainfall simulator ogden et al 1997 was calibrated to apply an average rainfall of 76 54 mm h 1 for 30 min a rate and duration similar to natural storm events with a return period of 10 years barbosa briones et al 2019 an orthorectified and atmospherically corrected worldview 2 satellite image from february 2015 order number 054873271010 with a spatial resolution of 0 50 m was used to map the vegetated patches and inter patches percent vegetation cover was estimated in the field within sampling plots georeferenced with differential gps the spectral values of the worldview 2 bands were used to estimate land cover within the basin with an estimation error of 14 7 vegetation cover was categorized into three classes based on ecohydrological responses and assigned the corresponding w factor values barbosa briones et al 2019 inter patch areas with vegetation cover 30 w 0 23 medium cover patch with cover between 30 and 60 w 0 17 and densely vegetated patches with cover 60 w 0 0399 2 5 data analysis 2 5 1 differences in perimeters perimeters derived from each dem were overlapped to detect differences in perimeter boundaries and compare them to a reference perimeter perimeter is an essential element as it increases or decreases the basin area impacting other ic aspects such as distance to sinks slopes and the w factor all basins delimited with each dem were intersected to obtain a unique polygon reference basin where all basin boundaries converged and this was used as a reference basin all perimeters including the reference perimeter from the reference basin were intersected with a 100 100 m orthogonal grid to divide them into target segments the boundaries from each dem which were assigned an id and a geographical orientation n ne e se s sw w nw from the basin centroid then the middle point of the reference perimeter within each grid was identified to create a reference point database the total number of reference points was 1767 for site 1 and 293 points for site 2 euclidean distances from each reference point to each target segment were computed using the near tool in arcgis 10 3 to obtain the differential distance between each target segment and between target segments and the reference perimeter these data were further analyzed as described in section 2 5 3 2 5 2 subtraction of index of connectivity maps all ic rasters were clipped with the reference basin to obtain the same comparison areas and the ic was normalized from 0 to 1 to eliminate negative values and prevent misleading results from arithmetic operations that not show the real dynamics of ic changes for instance if we have a value of ic 1 in a given pixel from a dem and then a value of ic 2 from another dem in the same pixel when substracting the first ic value from the second the result will be 3 which would mean a decrease in the ic when in fact connectivity increases index of connectivity rasters for each study area were resampled by nearest neighbor algorithm at the same spatial resolution site 1 15 m site 2 5 m and were subtracted to identify differences in spatial distribution of the ic the ic rasters were reclassified into maj and min depending on whether the difference values were positive maj or negative min to analyze the dimension of the areas with differences 2 5 3 statistical analyses the differences between the boundaries plotted from each dem and the reference perimeter for each study site were analyzed to obtain the root mean square error rmse and identify deviations from the reference perimeter similar to the approach of yang et al 2014 differences were also analyzed with a repeated measures anova to detect significant differences between the plotted perimeter borders p 0 05 this model enables the variances of subjects or cases that have different measures of the same attribute to be examined recognizing the interactions between intra and inter subject factors and the individual effects of each one the repeated measures analysis considered intra subject factors repeated measures the distances from each reference point to the target segment and an inter subject factor a characteristic that groups the elements into discrete sets the geographic orientation of each reference point the ic for each dem were analyzed with a one way anova through randomly distributed sampling points site 1n 243 and site 2n 244 points for which ic was extracted using zonal statistics pairwise comparisons were made to identify differences in the ic between dems p 0 05 regression trees were constructed using the same sampling points to explore the influence of general metrics section 2 3 in the ic differences of subtracted maj min maps regression trees are a non parametric technique that segments stratifies predicts and identifies the interaction between response and explanatory variables berlanga et al 2013 the cart classification and regression trees method which divides the data into segments that are as homogeneous as possible with respect to the response variable i e the differences in ic between dems was used in this study the coefficient of determination r2 was determined for all regression trees by subtracting one from the ratio of the standard error of the risk and the variance all statistical analyses were undertaken with the ibm spss statistics 27 software faculty pack license 3 results 3 1 general characteristics of delimited basins in site 1 the reference basin had an area and perimeter of 534 km2 and 177 km respectively the largest basin areas and perimeters were obtained with alos and srtm dems and the smallest area and perimeter were obtained with the mec dem table 2 in site 2 the area and perimeter of the reference basin were 23 km2 and 31 km respectively the largest area and perimeter were obtained with the aster dem while the smallest area and perimeter were from the lidar dem 3 2 deviations from reference perimeters in site 1 the lowest deviation from the reference perimeter fig 2 was found with the mec dem rmse 59 6 m followed in increasing order by the aster dem rmse 415 m alos dem rmse 427 2 m and srtm dem rmse 428 5 m in general the largest deviations were toward the nw where rmse values were 1 200 m in the alos aster and srtm dems perimeters while the mec dem had the lowest rms 10 m in this geographic direction in site 2 the lowest deviation from the reference perimeter fig 3 was found with the lidar dem rmse 43 7 m followed in increasing order by srtm dem rmse 71 9 m alos dem rmse 74 2 m and aster dem rmse 216 6 m the largest deviations occurred toward the w with aster dem rms 530 m while the rmse values were lower by 56 m in this geographic direction than with the other dems 3 3 differences between dem perimeters in site 1 perimeters of alos and aster dems were similar p 0 05 mec and srtm dems were different from each other and from alos and aster dems p 0 05 in site 2 the perimeters of alos mec and srtm dems were similar p 0 05 in contrast the perimeter boundaries of lidar and aster dems were different from each other and from alos mec and srtm dems p 0 05 3 4 index of connectivity the ic obtained with the four dems for site 1 ranged between 0 6 and 14 table 3 the maximum ic was found in icalos and icmec and the minimum with icaster the widest range was presented in icalos while icsrtm had the narrowest at site 2 the ic ranged from 0 01 to 9 5 table 3 the maximum values and the widest range were obtained with iclidar icaster had the minimum values while the narrowest range was found in icsrtm in site 1 the lowest hydrological connectivity values were distributed from sw to nw where most forests are located the highest ic were found in lower and flatter sections with a n to s direction fig 4 in site 2 the highest ic were found in the n and ne direction mainly in the proximity of the hydrological network the lowest values were concentrated in the se and sw portions of the basin fig 5 3 4 1 differences in ic from different dem sources in site 1 excepting icaster the highest ic was found with the lowest spatial resolution therefore icsrtm had the highest values compared to the remaining dems p 0 05 table 3 icaster had the lowest ic and was similar to icmec p 0 05 which in turn were similar to icalos p 0 05 in contrast in site 2 as spatial resolution decreased the ic decreased too thus iclidar had the highest values compared to the remaining dems p 0 05 also as in site 1 dems with similar resolution alos and mec or aster and srtm dems had similar connectivity values the lower the spatial resolution the lower the hydrological connectivity values p 0 05 3 4 2 spatial structure of subtracted ic maps in site 1 the highest differences when ics were compared with each other were obtained with the icsrtm fig 6 areas with differences 0 maj comprised on average 76 of the basin area when other ic maps were subtracted from icsrtm and the areas with differences 0 min had a fragmented distribution in the vicinity of the sinks the largest maj areas were obtained with icsrtm icaster 80 of the study area in site 2 the highest differences when comparing ics with each other were obtained with the iclidar fig 6 areas with differences 0 maj comprised on average 70 of the basin area when other ic maps were subtracted from iclidar and the areas with differences 0 min had a fragmented distribution in the vicinity of the sinks and at the north of the basin the largest maj areas were obtained with iclidar icalos 72 of the study area 3 4 3 general metrics related to the spatial structure of the index of connectivity the regression trees implemented at site 1 ranged between two and five levels with r2 between 0 12 and 0 24 the explanatory variables considering all subtractions from icsrtm were hydrological and euclidean distance to the sink hd and ed slope direction asp and altitudinal range ar the highest r2 in this analysis was from icsrtm icalos r2 0 23 followed by icsrtm icmec r2 0 22 and icsrtm icaster r2 0 20 table 4 comparing icaster with the other ics the general metrics explaining ic differences were hydrological distance hd slope direction asp and euclidean distance ed of all subtractions icalos icmec had the highest r2 0 24 and included as explanatory variables slope direction asp hydrological distance hd and altitudinal range ar the lowest r2 was obtained from icalos icaster r2 0 11 where altitudinal range ar and hydrologic distance to the sink hd were identified as general metrics explaining ic differences the regression trees implemented in site 2 had between one and five levels with an r2 between 0 18 and 0 37 the most important explanatory variables were hydrological and euclidean distance to the sink hd and ed these metrics were important in iclidar icsrtm r2 0 21 icalos icsrtm r2 0 18 icmec icsrtm r2 0 19 and icaster icsrtm r2 0 32 the highest r2 among all the subtractions was obtained from iclidar icmec r2 0 37 4 discussion terrain data is one of the common inputs in hydrological models and connectivity indices obtained from digital elevation models dems of different spatial resolutions borselli et al 2008 brardinoni et al 2015 heckmann and vericat 2018 yang et al 2014 since the selection of the optimal spatial resolution depends on the availability and or technological capacity and the objectives of the analysis cantreul et al 2018 estrany et al 2019 it is essential to acknowledge the effect of dem spatial resolution and source on the outputs from hydrological analyses and basin parameters as we found significant differences between the studied dems in detailed analyses such as those conducted by lópez vicente and álvarez 2018 and cantreul et al 2018 who studied the sensitivity of the ic to dem resolution suggested an optimal resolution of 1 m although study objectives must also be considered when choosing dem resolution cantreul et al 2018 these studies use high resolution models 0 04 1 m obtained through the scanner photogrammetry or lidar from various airborne platforms in experimental plots or basins no 130 ha however these approaches may be expensive although new technologies are increasingly affordable cavalli et al 2020 high resolution dems are not always available have partial coverage or are cost prohibitive in developing countries to cope with these issues and based on recommendations by habtezion et al 2016 who recommend meter scale spatial resolution for basins at the kilometer scale in our study dems with a spatial resolution that matches this condition were freely available 4 1 general metrics our study s perimeter and area delineation did not present a consistent change in increase or decrease attributable to dem spatial resolution as found by lópez vicente and álvarez 2018 for instance in our study the highest dem resolutions can produce larger or smaller areas and perimeters and vice versa this inconsistent change relationship between these basin characteristics has also been reported by li and wong 2010 with dem spatial resolutions 30 m in site 1 the largest perimeter and area were obtained with alos the highest resolution dem in this basin in contrast in site 2 the largest perimeter and area dimensions were obtained with aster one of the lowest spatial resolution dems these differences can also be related to the topographic characteristics e g mountainous or flat this condition is evident in site 1 with a larger basin area than site 2 but in mountainous terrain with a sinuous basin border in contrast site 2 with a smaller basin area than site 1 is located in a gently sloping terrain with a less curved basin border thus topographic characteristics are an essential element that influences the relationship between perimeter and area dimensions and spatial resolutions as recognized by buakhao and kangrang 2016 in this analysis we used a reference area and perimeter delimited by overlapping the boundaries produced by all dems which minimized the problems derived from potential differences in area and perimeter obtained with each dem surface obstructions or lack of independent elevation data that prevented a reliable and accurate basin boundary from being generated this approach also allowed delimitation of common area for all ic maps for comparison and identified relationships between ic subtracted maps with the general metrics another feature closely related to the spatial resolution of dem is the length and density of the drainage network yang et al 2014 which also may affect hydrological connectivity hydrological connectivity characteristics depend on the spatial location of the targets and ic will change depending on whether the target is the hydrologic network as in our study or the basin outlet or both cavalli et al 2013 studies involving spatial resolutions ranging from 1 to 100 m have identified that the length and density of the stream network decrease as spatial resolution decreases claessens et al 2005 thieken et al 1999 however in our study the length and density of the drainage network were greater as spatial resolution decreased an important aspect is that in addition to dem spatial resolution the drainage network may also be affected by terrain configurations which influence the ability to identify a more detailed stream delineation in site 1 the well defined convergent slopes favor delineating a well defined hydrological network even at low resolutions 30 m in site 2 the gentle and divergent slopes make it more difficult to delineate streams with more precision the effect of understanding stream network detail on ic can also be seen in the cart analysis as ed and hd were two general metrics that can explain the spatial distribution of ic differences in the subtraction maps 4 2 differences in index of connectivity our results did not consistently follow the pattern reported in other studies with respect to the relationship between spatial resolution and index of connectivity values site 1 srtm has the highest ic but two groups based on ic in decreasing order were formed alos mec and mec aster in site 2 lidar has the highest ic and the two groups formed by similar resolutions and ic in decreasing order were alos mec and aster srtm only in site 1 do our results agree with those reported in other studies where the ics increase as dem resolution decreases cantreul et al 2018 habtezion et al 2016 lópez vicente and álvarez 2018 zanandrea et al 2019 this pattern of ic as a function of dem spatial resolution was not observed in site 2 where ic increased at higher resolution the different patterns in our results may be related to the ability of the dem to represent relief details accurately in site 1 low resolutions efficiently represent mountainous topography convergent slopes because of the detail in the hydrological network distance to sinks is the most important response variable for explaining the ic subtracted maps in contrast in an environment such as site 2 a high resolution is required to represent gentle divergent slopes that may have multiple flow directions the lidar dem captured these characteristics that modify the index of connectivity moreover at lower dem resolutions all relief details are generalized by the higher pixel area resulting in a less reliable ic computation the differences in ic between the dems with the same spatial resolution as aster and srtm 30 m are noteworthy in 80 of the basin area in site 1 and 45 of the basin area in site 2 srtm shows higher ic than that obtained with aster the explanatory variables related to these differences in the subtracted maps were slope direction distance to the sinks and altitudinal range r2 0 20 in site 1 and r2 0 32 in site 2 huggel et al 2008 also identified slope direction as an element related to the differences between srtm and aster this shows that although spatial resolution has an important impact on the results of hydrological models yang et al 2014 including connectivity simulations cantreul et al 2018 habtezion et al 2016 dem generation methods could also generate differences since the post processing methods are usually sources of errors claessens et al 2005 a parameter that is often affected by dem generation methods is vertical accuracy which is essential for basin delimitation in gentle terrain a study conducted by carrera hernández 2021 who analyzed the vertical accuracy of several freely available dems for mexico found that lidar and mec have the highest vertical accuracy followed in decreasing order by alos srtm and aster 4 3 terrain land use cover interface to select an optimal analysis resolution it is also necessary to consider the physical characteristics of the environment of interest cantreul et al 2018 claessens et al 2005 land cover characteristics e g density spatio temporal distribution may be highly variable therefore they must be accounted for conducting the study in two contrasting environments enabled the ic dynamics to be analyzed in two sites where land use cover distribution and relief are different these different configurations emphasize that despite the topographic dependence of ic simulations habtezion et al 2016 lópez vicente and álvarez 2018 thomas et al 2017 vegetation distribution and its hydrological response should be measured in the field and be given equal importance to dem spatial resolution for instance where vegetation cover is very low metrics such as the roughness index have been successfully included cavalli et al 2013 ortíz rodríguez et al 2017 in areas where vegetation distribution is heterogeneous a higher spatial resolution is required for the land use cover configuration and its ecohydrological function to be represented in the spatial resolution our study made an effort to incorporate the measured ecohydrological functionality of vegetated patches and inter patches into the ic calculations at site 2 by means of the w factor in contrast when vegetation distribution patterns are homogeneous as in the case of site 1 the effect of vegetation cover can be represented by lower spatial resolutions however studies of the land cover factor spatial resolution applied to hydrological connectivity simulations are still few adequate spatial resolution is necessary to describe feedback between vegetation and connectivity and constitutes an area of opportunity for future analysis given the strong influence of vegetation on the ecohydrological function and restoration which is affected by connectivity and vice versa liu et al 2020 puttock et al 2013 saco et al 2020 finding what economic activities are conducted in the study areas and how they modify relief and vegetation distribution patterns is also essential in site 2 open pit mining was carried out until recently this has changed the surface but these modifications were not registered in all the analyzed dems because of their capture date the mine pit was only present in lidar dem as it was generated after the mining activities started in 2007 fig 7 the pit mine and tailings dams affect the pattern of the drainage network that functions as a sink in ic computation since the bottom of the mine area is flat flow direction and accumulation are affected resulting in a shorter drainage area and network which explains lower lidar ic values than all the other dem derived ics see fig 6 hydrological connectivity is a complex process involving several environmental factors which can be simplified through the index of connectivity for a better understanding of its dynamics and trends topography is an essential input within this framework and care must be taken when selecting dem spatial resolution and source our approach strikes a balance between topographic accuracy data processing storage capacity and obtaining interpretable data which are essential in modeling hydrological processes thomas et al 2017 5 conclusions by analyzing two basins in contrasting environments the importance of considering the physical and environmental features for selecting an optimal spatial resolution such as topographic configuration the spatial distribution of the w factor e g land use cover and location of sinks and targets were highlighted the spatial resolution of dems determines the relief detail influencing the outputs of the index of connectivity and ecohydrological models thus an optimal resolution must be selected to represent topographic features and basin morphometry without compromising their interpretation and data processing capabilities although it is recommended in many cases to use dems with high spatial resolutions 1 m access to these data is still limited in developing countries due to technological and economic issues given these limitations we used freely available dems to compute the index of connectivity and outline the main criteria to support the selection of dem spatial resolution according to relief and land use cover even though these dems reduce costs and have global coverage a pitfall is that the available spatial resolutions are 5 m which may not be enough for some applications although the differences between the ic from the different spatial resolutions were in most cases evident the result was not consistent in the studied basins in site 1 the lower the spatial resolution the higher the ic in contrast in site 2 the higher the resolution the higher the ic this discrepancy was related to the topographic configuration and spatial distribution of land use cover in each site and the capabilities of the different spatial resolutions to capture detail for sites with gentle slopes as in site 2 higher resolutions should be used as slopes tend to be divergent and the stream network less defined in addition the generalization of data at lower resolutions prevents identifying features that connect or disconnect areas in contrast for sites with steep slopes as in site 1 lower resolutions 30 m can be used because hillslopes are convergent thus the stream network is more well defined and the generalization of data at these resolutions may not affect the identification of elements related to hydrological connectivity a higher resolution dem will result in a more detailed stream network if this hydrologic network is considered a sink its location modifies the value of the downslope element in the ic formula the importance of a detailed stream network was evident as distance to sinks was one of the variables with the highest relative importance for explaining the differences in ic from the different dem resolutions in both study areas hydrological connectivity is a characteristic that changes with scale therefore further analysis is still needed to identify the effects of medium and low spatial resolutions on hydrological connectivity including the elements that constitute the w factor heterogeneous and dispersed land cover may need a higher resolution to identify the spatial distribution of the w factor in contrast with continuous vegetation cover for which lower resolutions are expected to capture enough detail in summary the selection of dem spatial resolution should rely on the advantages of open access elevation data if technological and economic capabilities are limited one of the main benefits of freely available dems is cost reduction which can make studies affordable for research and management purposes as long as environmental features meet study objectives and support decision making credit

3200,assessment of hydrological connectivity is a valuable tool for water management it enables various environmental factors related to water mediated transport of matter and energy within or between elements of a system to be identified and incorporated into hydrological models the index of connectivity ic is widely used to quantify hydrological connectivity however it may be influenced by the spatial resolution of the digital elevation model dem which is one of the common inputs as pixel size modifies some basin parameters several dems available on open access platforms with spatial resolutions from 5 to 30 m lidar alos mec aster srtm were compared to identify differences between ic in two basins with contrasting environments site 1 steep slope terrain with warm humid climate and site 2 gentle hill slopes with semi arid climate differences in perimeters were analyzed using glm repeated measures anova while for differences in ic one way anova was used relationships between ic subtracted maps and basin parameters were explored with classification and regression trees cart basin perimeters and ic varied as a function of dem resolution but environmental factors such as relief and land use cover seemed to influence ic maps distance to sinks was one of the variables explaining spatial differences in ic between dems the selection of dem spatial resolution for hydrological connectivity analysis should be based on the characteristics of the study area economic and technological issues and whether the objectives can be met with the available dem resolution keywords hydrological analysis lidar aster srtm alos 1 introduction connectivity refers to the influence of a system s intrinsic organization on its global behavior and how it allows the exchange of matter and energy within and out of such a system antoine et al 2009 pringle 2001 wohl et al 2017 as a ubiquitous process the study of connectivity has attracted interest in geomorphology hydrology geology ecology biology and neuroscience bourgeois et al 2017 keesstra et al 2018 turnbull et al 2018 through this perspective the development of theoretical methodological frameworks in such a diversity of areas of knowledge has stimulated multi and interdisciplinary studies turnbull et al 2018 in hydrology structural connectivity refers to how a system allows or prevents water and sediments transfer within and out of itself which is related to the spatial organization of the elements of the system lexartza artza and wainwright 2009 in addition functional connectivity analyzes the dynamic processes taking place in a structurally connected network turnbull et al 2018 both help us understand and express the complexity of the system s non linear responses related to the balance between water entry by any precipitation type and the consequent production of runoff and sediments lópez vicente and álvarez 2018 for instance hydrological connectivity reveals the continuity of runoff and the routes by which water and sediment move at any given time fryirs 2013 heckmann et al 2018 offers a synthetic approach to analyzing basin responses to global and local changes cantreul et al 2018 and helps to evaluate the effectiveness of ecosystem management strategies puttock et al 2013 wainwright et al 2011 another strength of hydrological connectivity is the simplicity of its measurement through indices that require input data such as topographic variables and land use cover some studies have primarily used a digital elevation model dem from which the rest of the inputs are derived cavalli et al 2013 while others have included dem data and land use cover derived from remotely sensed data kumar et al 2014 martini et al 2019 in any case the common input is a dem as hydrological connectivity indices are closely related to its resolution brardinoni et al 2015 cantreul et al 2018 since pixel size modifies essential parameters such as basin boundary area and perimeter density and length of the drainage network slope and slope direction among other characteristics borselli et al 2008 although dem resolution has been evaluated in the context of hydrological features and models deng et al 2007 kienzle 2004 li et al 2017 sørensen and seibert 2007 wechesler 2007 analysis of its effects on hydrological connectivity is still under development estrany et al 2019 lópez vicente and álvarez 2018 zanandrea et al 2019 previous studies acknowledge that index of connectivity borselli et al 2008 cavalli et al 2013 values rises as the dem pixel size increases since topographic details could act as disconnection or impedance elements that tend to be smoothed by low dem spatial resolutions habtezion et al 2016 lópez vicente and álvarez 2018 in addition it has been found a strong correlation between dem resolution and index of connectivity providing useful insights on these reasons brardinoni et al 2015 cantreul et al 2018 but high resolutions also tend to introduce noise into the hydrological connectivity model lópez vicente and álvarez 2018 high resolution dems entail other challenges such as the availability of information on open access platforms the technological capacity to generate dems the often cost prohibitive access to high resolution data and computational processing requirements cantreul et al 2016 zanandrea et al 2019 therefore the choice of the spatial resolution of the dem will depend on data availability claessens et al 2005 and the visualization needs of the study akbari et al 2009 habtezion et al 2016 suggest that since calculation capacity is usually one of the main limitations a dem spatial resolution on the cm scale may be used for a meter scale area while a meter scale is applicable for a study of a km scale area when the economic and technological resources are limited to acquiring or generating a high resolution dem data from open access platforms constitute an alternative to obtaining elevation data examples of these data include the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster shuttle radar topography mission srtm advanced land observing satellite alos and locally in mexico the mexican elevation continuum mec administered by the national institute of statistics and geography inegi which also supplies lidar data since connectivity is an emergent property of geomorphic systems and contributes to proactive territory management smetanová et al 2018 it is vital to account for differences when assessing hydrological connectivity related to dem spatial resolution yet most of the efforts have focused on the effect of changing pixel size from the same elevation data source brardinoni et al 2015 cantreul et al 2018 habtezion et al 2016 lópez vicente and álvarez 2018 however research regarding the impact of different sources and spatial resolutions on hydrological connectivity or morphometric parameters affecting it e g perimeter is still scarce therefore is essential to assess these dem features from sources available in free access platforms since these data may be the most affordable option in developing countries zanandrea et al 2019 in this sense this study aimed to compare the index of connectivity outputs borselli et al 2008 and basin perimeters computed from different freely available digital elevation models with spatial resolutions ranging from 5 to 30 m in two basins with contrasting environments in central mexico site 1 is located in a warm humid climate environment with steep convergent slopes and spatially homogeneous vegetation distribution site 2 is in a dry temperate climate with gentle divergent slopes and heterogeneous vegetation distribution the selected dem sources were srtm aster alos mexican elevation continuum and lidar the latter is available at no cost for mexico provided by the national institute of statistics and geography we expect the different dem spatial resolutions from the analized sources influence the morphometric and hydrographic basin characteristics that led to different hydrological connectivity patterns if these patterns differ from each other then the characteristics of the basins e g slope slope direction distances to hydrological network terrain curvatures among others that explain the differences in estimated hydrological connectivity had to be identified thus considerations and guidelines for selecting a spatial resolution are proposed for future studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites two basins in san luis potosí mexico located in contrasting natural environments were selected huichihuayán huehuetlán site 1 and cerro de san pedro site 2 fig 1 2 1 1 site 1 huichihuayán huehuetlán site is located in a warm humid region with a relief of rough narrow and elongated tectonic origin resulting from the deformation of mesozoic marine rocks eguiluz de antuñano et al 2000 the intense deformation of rocks favors a high dissection of

average annual temperature is between 18 c and 22 c the average annual rainfall ranges from 1200 to 2500 mm reaching 3000 mm in the highest parts of the topography garcía 1998 the humidity gradient descends from e to w the dominant vegetation types comprise tropical oak pine and cloud forests rzedowski 1961 land use includes livestock grazing and sugar cane and citrus cultivation inegi 2019 the land is always covered with either natural or cultivated vegetation which gives a spatially continuous character however areas of bare soil that are agricultural plots in the fallow period disrupt this continuity in some areas 2 1 2 site 2 cerro de san pedro the site is located in a dry temperate zone with a relief type composed of a combination of strongly deformed mesozoic marine rocks and

analysis 2 3 study sites and estimation of general metrics from digital elevation models the study sites were delimited in arcgis 10 3 using a flow accumulation threshold of 9 ha which provided enough detail while enabling a reasonable number of basins from an ecohydrological and ecosystem restoration perspective for each site general metrics were computed perimeter km total area km2 total length

distance to sinks m euclidean distance to sinks ed and distance following hillslope flow according to slope direction roughness and tortuosity hd additionally plane curvature plc profile curvature prc tangential curvature tgc and relative stream power rsp were computed in terrain analysis system tas version 2 0 9 2 4 hydrological connectivity assessment the index of connectivity values for all the dems were calculated using the sedinconnect 2 3 program developed by crema and cavalli 2018 sedinconnect 2 3 calculates the index of connectivity ic proposed by borselli et al 2008 with the improvements introduced by cavalli et al 2013 the index of connectivity quantitatively expresses the probability that water and sediments are mobilized from a given point pass through a reference point and reach deposition zones also called sinks borselli et al 2008 the operational formula describing this process is as follows 1 i c log 10 w s a d w s the numerator represents the characteristics upslope from a reference point the elements are w average weighting factor related to land use cover s slope in the area contributing to the reference point m m a contributing area m2 the denominator represents the characteristics downslope from the reference point the elements are d distance to sink m w weighting factor related to land use cover in this study roads towns mining areas water bodies and the stream network were considered sinks for computing ic these sinks were common to ic calculations for all dems except stream networks derived from each dem the mining area i e mine pit and tailings dams disrupted hydrological connectivity in the landscape and were considered sinks since there was no outcoming flow 2 4 1 weighting factor w the ic proposed by borselli et al 2008 has been applied to multiple environments for different purposes by adapting the w factor to the particular objectives of each analysis the w factor is related to allowing or inhibiting water and sediment from transferring within the study site and reaching the outlet point the w factor values range from 0 to 1 values close to 0 correspond to features that inhibit or reduce the connectivity while values closer to 1 relate to elements that favor or increase the connectivity given the different spatial arrangement of land use cover in the two study sites the w factor was determined in two ways as explained in the following sections 2 4 1 1 site 1 w factor the c factor values from the universal soil loss equation usle were used as the w factor for each land use cover within the basin supervised classification of an atmospherically corrected landsat satellite image from february 2014 espa cr usgs gov was undertaken by building a classification tree cart in ibm spss statistics 27 faculty pack license the resulting classification tree was implemented and validated in the envi 5 0 program obtaining a classification accuracy of 86 0 the resulting land use cover classes and corresponding w factor values taken from the rusle s c factor were crops w 0 2 oak forest w 0 001 pine forest w 0 001 pasture w 0 003 and evergreen forest w 0 001 values near zero indicate more soil protection by vegetation and thus less connectivity for instance any forest will have lower connectivity compared to a crop 2 4 1 2 site 2 w factor due to the patterned landscape of this semi arid basin the w factor was assigned based on the average runoff coefficient obtained through 120 rainfall simulations undertaken in vegetated patches and inter patches a cornell sprinkle infiltrometer type rainfall simulator ogden et al 1997 was calibrated to apply an average rainfall of 76 54 mm h 1 for 30 min a rate and duration similar to natural storm events with a return period of 10 years barbosa briones et al 2019 an orthorectified and atmospherically corrected worldview 2 satellite image from february 2015 order number 054873271010 with a spatial resolution of 0 50 m was used to map the vegetated patches and inter patches percent vegetation cover was estimated in the field within sampling plots georeferenced with differential gps the spectral values of the worldview 2 bands were used to estimate land cover within the basin with an estimation error of 14 7 vegetation cover was categorized into three classes based on ecohydrological responses and assigned the corresponding w factor values barbosa briones et al 2019 inter patch areas with vegetation cover 30 w 0 23 medium cover patch with cover between 30 and 60 w 0 17 and densely vegetated patches with cover 60 w 0 0399 2 5 data analysis 2 5 1 differences in perimeters perimeters derived from each dem were overlapped to detect differences in perimeter boundaries and compare them to a reference perimeter perimeter is an essential element as it increases or decreases the basin area impacting other ic aspects such as distance to sinks slopes and the w factor all basins delimited with each dem were intersected to obtain a unique polygon reference basin where all basin boundaries converged and this was used as a reference basin all perimeters including the reference perimeter from the reference basin were intersected with a 100 100 m orthogonal grid to divide them into target segments the boundaries from each dem which were assigned an id and a geographical orientation n ne e se s sw w nw from the basin centroid then the middle point of the reference perimeter within each grid was identified to create a reference point database the total number of reference points was 1767 for site 1 and 293 points for site 2 euclidean distances from each reference point to each target segment were computed using the near tool in arcgis 10 3 to obtain the differential distance between each target segment and between target segments and the reference perimeter these data were further analyzed as described in section 2 5 3 2 5 2 subtraction of index of connectivity maps all ic rasters were clipped with the reference basin to obtain the same comparison areas and the ic was normalized from 0 to 1 to eliminate negative values and prevent misleading results from arithmetic operations that not show the real dynamics of ic changes for instance if we have a value of ic 1 in a given pixel from a dem and then a value of ic 2 from another dem in the same pixel when substracting the first ic value from the second the result will be 3 which would mean a decrease in the ic when in fact connectivity increases index of connectivity rasters for each study area were resampled by nearest neighbor algorithm at the same spatial resolution site 1 15 m site 2 5 m and were subtracted to identify differences in spatial distribution of the ic the ic rasters were reclassified into maj and min depending on whether the difference values were positive maj or negative min to analyze the dimension of the areas with differences 2 5 3 statistical analyses the differences between the boundaries plotted from each dem and the reference perimeter for each study site were analyzed to obtain the root mean square error rmse and identify deviations from the reference perimeter similar to the approach of yang et al 2014 differences were also analyzed with a repeated measures anova to detect significant differences between the plotted perimeter borders p 0 05 this model enables the variances of subjects or cases that have different measures of the same attribute to be examined recognizing the interactions between intra and inter subject factors and the individual effects of each one the repeated measures analysis considered intra subject factors repeated measures the distances from each reference point to the target segment and an inter subject factor a characteristic that groups the elements into discrete sets the geographic orientation of each reference point the ic for each dem were analyzed with a one way anova through randomly distributed sampling points site 1n 243 and site 2n 244 points for which ic was extracted using zonal statistics pairwise comparisons were made to identify differences in the ic between dems p 0 05 regression trees were constructed using the same sampling points to explore the influence of general metrics section 2 3 in the ic differences of subtracted maj min maps regression trees are a non parametric technique that segments stratifies predicts and identifies the interaction between response and explanatory variables berlanga et al 2013 the cart classification and regression trees method which divides the data into segments that are as homogeneous as possible with respect to the response variable i e the differences in ic between dems was used in this study the coefficient of determination r2 was determined for all regression trees by subtracting one from the ratio of the standard error of the risk and the variance all statistical analyses were undertaken with the ibm spss statistics 27 software faculty pack license 3 results 3 1 general characteristics of delimited basins in site 1 the reference basin had an area and perimeter of 534 km2 and 177 km respectively the largest basin areas and perimeters were obtained with alos and srtm dems and the smallest area and perimeter were obtained with the mec dem table 2 in site 2 the area and perimeter of the reference basin were 23 km2 and 31 km respectively the largest area and perimeter were obtained with the aster dem while the smallest area and perimeter were from the lidar dem 3 2 deviations from reference perimeters in site 1 the lowest deviation from the reference perimeter fig 2 was found with the mec dem rmse 59 6 m followed in increasing order by the aster dem rmse 415 m alos dem rmse 427 2 m and srtm dem rmse 428 5 m in general the largest deviations were toward the nw where rmse values were 1 200 m in the alos aster and srtm dems perimeters while the mec dem had the lowest rms 10 m in this geographic direction in site 2 the lowest deviation from the reference perimeter fig 3 was found with the lidar dem rmse 43 7 m followed in increasing order by srtm dem rmse 71 9 m alos dem rmse 74 2 m and aster dem rmse 216 6 m the largest deviations occurred toward the w with aster dem rms 530 m while the rmse values were lower by 56 m in this geographic direction than with the other dems 3 3 differences between dem perimeters in site 1 perimeters of alos and aster dems were similar p 0 05 mec and srtm dems were different from each other and from alos and aster dems p 0 05 in site 2 the perimeters of alos mec and srtm dems were similar p 0 05 in contrast the perimeter boundaries of lidar and aster dems were different from each other and from alos mec and srtm dems p 0 05 3 4 index of connectivity the ic obtained with the four dems for site 1 ranged between 0 6 and 14 table 3 the maximum ic was found in icalos and icmec and the minimum with icaster the widest range was presented in icalos while icsrtm had the narrowest at site 2 the ic ranged from 0 01 to 9 5 table 3 the maximum values and the widest range were obtained with iclidar icaster had the minimum values while the narrowest range was found in icsrtm in site 1 the lowest hydrological connectivity values were distributed from sw to nw where most forests are located the highest ic were found in lower and flatter sections with a n to s direction fig 4 in site 2 the highest ic were found in the n and ne direction mainly in the proximity of the hydrological network the lowest values were concentrated in the se and sw portions of the basin fig 5 3 4 1 differences in ic from different dem sources in site 1 excepting icaster the highest ic was found with the lowest spatial resolution therefore icsrtm had the highest values compared to the remaining dems p 0 05 table 3 icaster had the lowest ic and was similar to icmec p 0 05 which in turn were similar to icalos p 0 05 in contrast in site 2 as spatial resolution decreased the ic decreased too thus iclidar had the highest values compared to the remaining dems p 0 05 also as in site 1 dems with similar resolution alos and mec or aster and srtm dems had similar connectivity values the lower the spatial resolution the lower the hydrological connectivity values p 0 05 3 4 2 spatial structure of subtracted ic maps in site 1 the highest differences when ics were compared with each other were obtained with the icsrtm fig 6 areas with differences 0 maj comprised on average 76 of the basin area when other ic maps were subtracted from icsrtm and the areas with differences 0 min had a fragmented distribution in the vicinity of the sinks the largest maj areas were obtained with icsrtm icaster 80 of the study area in site 2 the highest differences when comparing ics with each other were obtained with the iclidar fig 6 areas with differences 0 maj comprised on average 70 of the basin area when other ic maps were subtracted from iclidar and the areas with differences 0 min had a fragmented distribution in the vicinity of the sinks and at the north of the basin the largest maj areas were obtained with iclidar icalos 72 of the study area 3 4 3 general metrics related to the spatial structure of the index of connectivity the regression trees implemented at site 1 ranged between two and five levels with r2 between 0 12 and 0 24 the explanatory variables considering all subtractions from icsrtm were hydrological and euclidean distance to the sink hd and ed slope direction asp and altitudinal range ar the highest r2 in this analysis was from icsrtm icalos r2 0 23 followed by icsrtm icmec r2 0 22 and icsrtm icaster r2 0 20 table 4 comparing icaster with the other ics the general metrics explaining ic differences were hydrological distance hd slope direction asp and euclidean distance ed of all subtractions icalos icmec had the highest r2 0 24 and included as explanatory variables slope direction asp hydrological distance hd and altitudinal range ar the lowest r2 was obtained from icalos icaster r2 0 11 where altitudinal range ar and hydrologic distance to the sink hd were identified as general metrics explaining ic differences the regression trees implemented in site 2 had between one and five levels with an r2 between 0 18 and 0 37 the most important explanatory variables were hydrological and euclidean distance to the sink hd and ed these metrics were important in iclidar icsrtm r2 0 21 icalos icsrtm r2 0 18 icmec icsrtm r2 0 19 and icaster icsrtm r2 0 32 the highest r2 among all the subtractions was obtained from iclidar icmec r2 0 37 4 discussion terrain data is one of the common inputs in hydrological models and connectivity indices obtained from digital elevation models dems of different spatial resolutions borselli et al 2008 brardinoni et al 2015 heckmann and vericat 2018 yang et al 2014 since the selection of the optimal spatial resolution depends on the availability and or technological capacity and the objectives of the analysis cantreul et al 2018 estrany et al 2019 it is essential to acknowledge the effect of dem spatial resolution and source on the outputs from hydrological analyses and basin parameters as we found significant differences between the studied dems in detailed analyses such as those conducted by lópez vicente and álvarez 2018 and cantreul et al 2018 who studied the sensitivity of the ic to dem resolution suggested an optimal resolution of 1 m although study objectives must also be considered when choosing dem resolution cantreul et al 2018 these studies use high resolution models 0 04 1 m obtained through the scanner photogrammetry or lidar from various airborne platforms in experimental plots or basins no 130 ha however these approaches may be expensive although new technologies are increasingly affordable cavalli et al 2020 high resolution dems are not always available have partial coverage or are cost prohibitive in developing countries to cope with these issues and based on recommendations by habtezion et al 2016 who recommend meter scale spatial resolution for basins at the kilometer scale in our study dems with a spatial resolution that matches this condition were freely available 4 1 general metrics our study s perimeter and area delineation did not present a consistent change in increase or decrease attributable to dem spatial resolution as found by lópez vicente and álvarez 2018 for instance in our study the highest dem resolutions can produce larger or smaller areas and perimeters and vice versa this inconsistent change relationship between these basin characteristics has also been reported by li and wong 2010 with dem spatial resolutions 30 m in site 1 the largest perimeter and area were obtained with alos the highest resolution dem in this basin in contrast in site 2 the largest perimeter and area dimensions were obtained with aster one of the lowest spatial resolution dems these differences can also be related to the topographic characteristics e g mountainous or flat this condition is evident in site 1 with a larger basin area than site 2 but in mountainous terrain with a sinuous basin border in contrast site 2 with a smaller basin area than site 1 is located in a gently sloping terrain with a less curved basin border thus topographic characteristics are an essential element that influences the relationship between perimeter and area dimensions and spatial resolutions as recognized by buakhao and kangrang 2016 in this analysis we used a reference area and perimeter delimited by overlapping the boundaries produced by all dems which minimized the problems derived from potential differences in area and perimeter obtained with each dem surface obstructions or lack of independent elevation data that prevented a reliable and accurate basin boundary from being generated this approach also allowed delimitation of common area for all ic maps for comparison and identified relationships between ic subtracted maps with the general metrics another feature closely related to the spatial resolution of dem is the length and density of the drainage network yang et al 2014 which also may affect hydrological connectivity hydrological connectivity characteristics depend on the spatial location of the targets and ic will change depending on whether the target is the hydrologic network as in our study or the basin outlet or both cavalli et al 2013 studies involving spatial resolutions ranging from 1 to 100 m have identified that the length and density of the stream network decrease as spatial resolution decreases claessens et al 2005 thieken et al 1999 however in our study the length and density of the drainage network were greater as spatial resolution decreased an important aspect is that in addition to dem spatial resolution the drainage network may also be affected by terrain configurations which influence the ability to identify a more detailed stream delineation in site 1 the well defined convergent slopes favor delineating a well defined hydrological network even at low resolutions 30 m in site 2 the gentle and divergent slopes make it more difficult to delineate streams with more precision the effect of understanding stream network detail on ic can also be seen in the cart analysis as ed and hd were two general metrics that can explain the spatial distribution of ic differences in the subtraction maps 4 2 differences in index of connectivity our results did not consistently follow the pattern reported in other studies with respect to the relationship between spatial resolution and index of connectivity values site 1 srtm has the highest ic but two groups based on ic in decreasing order were formed alos mec and mec aster in site 2 lidar has the highest ic and the two groups formed by similar resolutions and ic in decreasing order were alos mec and aster srtm only in site 1 do our results agree with those reported in other studies where the ics increase as dem resolution decreases cantreul et al 2018 habtezion et al 2016 lópez vicente and álvarez 2018 zanandrea et al 2019 this pattern of ic as a function of dem spatial resolution was not observed in site 2 where ic increased at higher resolution the different patterns in our results may be related to the ability of the dem to represent relief details accurately in site 1 low resolutions efficiently represent mountainous topography convergent slopes because of the detail in the hydrological network distance to sinks is the most important response variable for explaining the ic subtracted maps in contrast in an environment such as site 2 a high resolution is required to represent gentle divergent slopes that may have multiple flow directions the lidar dem captured these characteristics that modify the index of connectivity moreover at lower dem resolutions all relief details are generalized by the higher pixel area resulting in a less reliable ic computation the differences in ic between the dems with the same spatial resolution as aster and srtm 30 m are noteworthy in 80 of the basin area in site 1 and 45 of the basin area in site 2 srtm shows higher ic than that obtained with aster the explanatory variables related to these differences in the subtracted maps were slope direction distance to the sinks and altitudinal range r2 0 20 in site 1 and r2 0 32 in site 2 huggel et al 2008 also identified slope direction as an element related to the differences between srtm and aster this shows that although spatial resolution has an important impact on the results of hydrological models yang et al 2014 including connectivity simulations cantreul et al 2018 habtezion et al 2016 dem generation methods could also generate differences since the post processing methods are usually sources of errors claessens et al 2005 a parameter that is often affected by dem generation methods is vertical accuracy which is essential for basin delimitation in gentle terrain a study conducted by carrera hernández 2021 who analyzed the vertical accuracy of several freely available dems for mexico found that lidar and mec have the highest vertical accuracy followed in decreasing order by alos srtm and aster 4 3 terrain land use cover interface to select an optimal analysis resolution it is also necessary to consider the physical characteristics of the environment of interest cantreul et al 2018 claessens et al 2005 land cover characteristics e g density spatio temporal distribution may be highly variable therefore they must be accounted for conducting the study in two contrasting environments enabled the ic dynamics to be analyzed in two sites where land use cover distribution and relief are different these different configurations emphasize that despite the topographic dependence of ic simulations habtezion et al 2016 lópez vicente and álvarez 2018 thomas et al 2017 vegetation distribution and its hydrological response should be measured in the field and be given equal importance to dem spatial resolution for instance where vegetation cover is very low metrics such as the roughness index have been successfully included cavalli et al 2013 ortíz rodríguez et al 2017 in areas where vegetation distribution is heterogeneous a higher spatial resolution is required for the land use cover configuration and its ecohydrological function to be represented in the spatial resolution our study made an effort to incorporate the measured ecohydrological functionality of vegetated patches and inter patches into the ic calculations at site 2 by means of the w factor in contrast when vegetation distribution patterns are homogeneous as in the case of site 1 the effect of vegetation cover can be represented by lower spatial resolutions however studies of the land cover factor spatial resolution applied to hydrological connectivity simulations are still few adequate spatial resolution is necessary to describe feedback between vegetation and connectivity and constitutes an area of opportunity for future analysis given the strong influence of vegetation on the ecohydrological function and restoration which is affected by connectivity and vice versa liu et al 2020 puttock et al 2013 saco et al 2020 finding what economic activities are conducted in the study areas and how they modify relief and vegetation distribution patterns is also essential in site 2 open pit mining was carried out until recently this has changed the surface but these modifications were not registered in all the analyzed dems because of their capture date the mine pit was only present in lidar dem as it was generated after the mining activities started in 2007 fig 7 the pit mine and tailings dams affect the pattern of the drainage network that functions as a sink in ic computation since the bottom of the mine area is flat flow direction and accumulation are affected resulting in a shorter drainage area and network which explains lower lidar ic values than all the other dem derived ics see fig 6 hydrological connectivity is a complex process involving several environmental factors which can be simplified through the index of connectivity for a better understanding of its dynamics and trends topography is an essential input within this framework and care must be taken when selecting dem spatial resolution and source our approach strikes a balance between topographic accuracy data processing storage capacity and obtaining interpretable data which are essential in modeling hydrological processes thomas et al 2017 5 conclusions by analyzing two basins in contrasting environments the importance of considering the physical and environmental features for selecting an optimal spatial resolution such as topographic configuration the spatial distribution of the w factor e g land use cover and location of sinks and targets were highlighted the spatial resolution of dems determines the relief detail influencing the outputs of the index of connectivity and ecohydrological models thus an optimal resolution must be selected to represent topographic features and basin morphometry without compromising their interpretation and data processing capabilities although it is recommended in many cases to use dems with high spatial resolutions 1 m access to these data is still limited in developing countries due to technological and economic issues given these limitations we used freely available dems to compute the index of connectivity and outline the main criteria to support the selection of dem spatial resolution according to relief and land use cover even though these dems reduce costs and have global coverage a pitfall is that the available spatial resolutions are 5 m which may not be enough for some applications although the differences between the ic from the different spatial resolutions were in most cases evident the result was not consistent in the studied basins in site 1 the lower the spatial resolution the higher the ic in contrast in site 2 the higher the resolution the higher the ic this discrepancy was related to the topographic configuration and spatial distribution of land use cover in each site and the capabilities of the different spatial resolutions to capture detail for sites with gentle slopes as in site 2 higher resolutions should be used as slopes tend to be divergent and the stream network less defined in addition the generalization of data at lower resolutions prevents identifying features that connect or disconnect areas in contrast for sites with steep slopes as in site 1 lower resolutions 30 m can be used because hillslopes are convergent thus the stream network is more well defined and the generalization of data at these resolutions may not affect the identification of elements related to hydrological connectivity a higher resolution dem will result in a more detailed stream network if this hydrologic network is considered a sink its location modifies the value of the downslope element in the ic formula the importance of a detailed stream network was evident as distance to sinks was one of the variables with the highest relative importance for explaining the differences in ic from the different dem resolutions in both study areas hydrological connectivity is a characteristic that changes with scale therefore further analysis is still needed to identify the effects of medium and low spatial resolutions on hydrological connectivity including the elements that constitute the w factor heterogeneous and dispersed land cover may need a higher resolution to identify the spatial distribution of the w factor in contrast with continuous vegetation cover for which lower resolutions are expected to capture enough detail in summary the selection of dem spatial resolution should rely on the advantages of open access elevation data if technological and economic capabilities are limited one of the main benefits of freely available dems is cost reduction which can make studies affordable for research and management purposes as long as environmental features meet study objectives and support decision making credit

3201,sub saharan africa s economy and livelihood are primarily dependent on agriculture which makes it highly vulnerable to the impacts of extreme weather events and climate change modelling and quantifying extreme rainfall and its temporal changes in such environments could thus provide crucial information for design insurance management ecology and climate adaptation rain gauge networks in the area are relatively sparse and often characterized by missing data which hamper the use of extreme value methods for estimating extreme precipitation quantiles in this study we adopted the simplified metastatistical extreme value approach for the estimation of extreme return levels based on ordinary events i e all the independent realizations of the variable of interest which was shown to be more accurate than traditional extreme value methods in the presence of short data records we examined data from 66 rain gauges covering diverse hydro climatic regions across ghana with the aim of i validating the robustness of the statistical approach ii characterising the climatic and altitudinal controls on the occurrence frequency and intensity of rainfall extremes and iii quantifying recent changes in the characteristics of extremes we found that a two parameter weibull distribution well approximates the tail of the daily rainfall distribution throughout the area our statistical approach can quantify extremes with largely reduced uncertainties 7 17 uncertainty in the 100 year return levels computed using 10 years of data versus 11 62 of extreme value based methods extreme precipitation statistics daily intensity distribution number of wet days extreme rainfall quantiles are found to significantly depend on latitude so that the four latitudinally layered hydro climatic regions typically adopted in the area well represent spatial variations elevation significantly affects the tail heaviness of the daily intensity distribution and thus extreme rainfall quantiles temporal changes during the period 1978 2018 are found to be non homogeneous in the area as well as within the four hydro climatic regions but are homogeneous in three altitude based regions we report contrasting trends in extreme return levels in low elevation 200 m a s l and hilly regions related to contrasting changes in the daily intensity distribution statistically significant positive trends in extreme daily rainfall amounts are observed in the inland low elevation region of the volta river basin which call for further investigation of changes in future precipitation extremes in this extremely important hydrological region in sub saharan africa keywords extreme daily rainfall ordinary events simplified mev trend analysis volta river ghana sub saharan africa data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction climate change is modifying the occurrence frequency and intensity of hydroclimatic extremes such as droughts and floods around the globe dadson et al 2019 tegegne and melesse 2020 fowler et al 2021 this has tremendous impact on the lives and properties of populations especially in the most vulnerable regions of the world such as sub saharan africa ssa this region is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change due to the low adaptive capacity and high sensitivity of the socio economic systems ipcc 2014 for example floods in africa have caused up to 27 000 fatalities between 1950 and 2019 tramblay et al 2020 also the 2009 floods in west africa after torrential rains affected 600 000 people in sixteen west african countries with burkina faso senegal niger and ghana as the most affected countries di baldassarre et al 2010 climate change impacts in ssa have also been shown to have serious social repercussions on the population such as rural urban migration since rainfed agricultural systems on which the rural livelihoods predominantly depend are affected by prolonged droughts and uncertain rainfall patterns serdeczny et al 2017 extreme rainfalls are the major causal element of floods in the region paeth et al 2011 in fact floods usually occur during the rainy seasons and develop over relatively short temporal scales 1 3 days there have also been incidences of flash floods developing in less than 24 h with unprecedented socio economic damages especially in major cities such as accra and kumasi ansah et al 2020 investigation of the august and september 2007 widespread floods in ssa demonstrated the difficulty of delineating meteorological extreme events at a regional scale paeth et al 2011 though interannual variability of flood magnitudes in africa has been found to depend more on annual maximum soil moisture than annual maximum precipitation tramblay et al 2021 the frequency and intensity of extreme daily rainfalls as triggers of floods are of great socio economic relevance and need to be investigated information on extreme rainfall characteristics such as frequency and intensity and their temporal changes are therefore very important for guiding the design of relevant water infrastructure e g dams and reservoirs flood insurance studies flood plain management and river ecological studies and eventually directing climate adaptation and hazard mitigation strategies rainfall frequency analysis relates the magnitude of extreme events to their frequency of occurrence through the use of probability distributions these are usually fitted to the observed extremes in order to extrapolate intensities corresponding to very rare and potentially still unobserved quantiles traditionally extreme values are analysed for this purpose either using annual maxima series or the peaks exceeding a high threshold albeit based on robust theory this approach suffers from the stochastic uncertainties that characterize the sampling of extremes so that reliable estimates of rare quantiles can only be obtained when very long records are available katz et al 2002 in particular the estimation of high order statistics from limited records unavoidably leads to large uncertainties so that strong assumptions on the tail behaviour of these extreme value distributions need to be adopted for example using regionalization or scaling approaches e g buishand 1991 burlando and rosso 1996 recent findings however suggest these assumptions could be violated in regions characterized by climatic gradients caused for instance by orography avanzi et al 2015 marra et al 2021a in addition the impacts of climate change on the dynamics of rainfall extremes with significant changes in both occurrence frequency and intensity of storms can make the use of extremes annual maxima series in particular misleading in quantifying and understanding future changes in extreme quantiles e g marra et al 2019 for these reasons there have been attempts to consider a larger amount of data for improving precipitation frequency analyses e g marani and ignaccolo 2015 volpi et al 2019 serinaldi et al 2020 for example the metastatistical extreme value mev approach was shown to combine important advantages over traditional approaches in terms of decreased estimation uncertainties and reduced assumptions zorzetto et al 2016 marra et al 2018 the underlying idea is that extremes are samples from the so called ordinary events that are all the independent realizations of the process of interest in the case of daily precipitation ordinary events are usually assumed to correspond to all the wet day amounts and modelled using a two parameter weibull distribution stretched exponential marani and ignaccolo 2015 zorzetto et al 2016 miniussi et al 2020 theoretical reasoning and observations however suggest that this stretched exponential model represents only the ordinary events tail rather than their entire distribution wilson and toumi 2005 marra et al 2019 wang et al 2020 miniussi and marra 2021 thus if sufficient data are available it is possible to estimate the model parameters by focusing on the right tail of the ordinary events as first proposed in the so called simplified mev smev formulation marra et al 2019 2020 as shown by serinaldi et al 2020 this approach is equivalent to the distribution of maxima in equally sized blocks under independence and identical distribution for the sake of consistency with recent literature we will use here the term smev this approach describes extremes by utilising parameters that directly relate to the properties of the ordinary events tail the parameters of the weibull distribution and to their average yearly number of occurrences the formulation has been applied over diverse climatic settings including continental temperate mediterranean and arid semi arid climates and was validated against historical long term data e g marra et al 2019 2020 miniussi and marra 2021 it has been found to outperform traditional extreme value methods in situations in which relatively short data records are available provided that the assumed tail model is correct but no study so far explored the climatic conditions typical of ssa few studies have investigated the characteristics of extreme rainfalls in ssa panthou et al 2012 for instance modelled and mapped extreme rainfalls using a block maxima formulation in the west african sub region these authors found that extreme rain events can be very localized even for ssa regions characterized by a fairly homogeneous climate harrison et al 2019 have reported significant changes in extreme rainfall characteristics in well gauged areas of ssa between 1950 and 2013 the use of ordinary rainfall events to model return levels could thus represent an important advantage for tropical climates in ssa which are characterised by relatively limited and sparse rain gauge networks as well as the associated numerous missing data e g harrison et al 2019 quagraine et al 2020 and where rainfall is also characterized by a strong local variability especially at the rain event scale we focus here on the relatively well instrumented area of ghana with long term high quality daily in situ rainfall data archive to gather methodological and quantitative insights of general interest for ssa to the best of our knowledge no attempt has been made to ascertain the controls on rainfall extremes and their regional coherency in ssa this study therefore aims at characterising the climatic and altitudinal controls on rainfall extremes in data sparse tropical regions using the smev formulation which is based on ordinary events and are related to all the wet day amounts in the case of daily rainfalls specifically we apply smev to historical daily in situ rainfall data in ghana to i validate the robustness of the underlying assumptions in tropical climates and the relative advantage it might present with respect to traditional extreme value approaches ii qualify and quantify the climatic and altitudinal controls on the extreme rainfall statistics and quantiles and iii evaluate and investigate past temporal trends in the extreme rainfall statistics and quantiles 2 study area and data 2 1 climate of the region ghana is located in west sub saharan africa between latitudes 4 n and 12 n and longitudes 1 5 e and 3 5 w fig 1 with approximately 227 533 km2 of land area and 11 000 km2 water bodies ghana is bounded to the east by togo to the west by ivory coast to the north by burkina faso and the south by the gulf of guinea part of the atlantic ocean the climate is characterised as tropical similar to many parts of the subregion according to the köppen geiger climate classification blue shades in the inset of fig 1 the climate is usually organized into four main zones as we move from north to south savannah transition forest and coastal zones amekudzi et al 2015 these zones can be roughly defined by latitudinal lines although there is a latitudinal overlap between the forest and the coastal zone since the western coast is classified as part of the forest climatic zone fig 1 the rainfall regime is characterized by dry and wet seasons which are modulated by the intertropical boundary and the two main high pressure systems namely the st helena high pressure system located in the southern hemisphere and the azores high pressure system located over the atlantic ocean ansah et al 2020 fig 2 reports the mean monthly rainfall seasonality with standard deviation shown as error bars representing inter station variability within each zone for the unimodal pattern of the savannah zone monthly rainfall values of above 100 mm are observed from may to september with a peak in august fig 2 the bimodal rainfall patterns are similar from january to june when the first rain season peaks the forest zone observes maximum rainfall during this period compared to the transition and coastal zones monthly rainfalls for all the three zones with bimodal patterns decrease from june to august and increase again for september and october the dynamics is however different for the second rainfall peak where the transition zone peaks in september whereas the forest and coastal zones peak in october in fact the transition zone records higher monthly mean rainfall in the second peak in september compared to the first peak in june fig 2 low rainfall values are consistently recorded from november to march for all the climatic zones 2 2 data and quality control historic daily in situ rainfall data for the period 1960 2018 from 73 stations across the four climatic zones of ghana were obtained from the ghana meteorological agency gmet for the purpose of this study gmet controls the quality of the data using the clidata software www clidata cz these include 22 synoptic stations with daily rainfall data and other climatic data temperature relative humidity sunshine hours wind speed and direction and cloud cover and 51 stations with only daily rainfall amounts fig 1 table s1 the stations were screened based on their record length and data quality and stations were retained for the study according to the following criteria i years with less than 10 of missing data were considered as valid ii stations with record length of at least 30 valid years were retained from the criteria 66 out of the 73 stations were considered covering savannah 12 stations transition 10 forest 37 and coastal 7 zones fig 1 table s1 for the purposes of the trend analysis the data was further screened to only consider stations with at least 34 years of data in the common period 1978 2018 this criterion allows to have long records for a robust temporal trend analysis a common coverage period and a widespread spatial coverage this reduced the dataset to 48 out of the 66 stations covering savannah 10 transition 7 forest 24 and coastal 7 zones fig 1 table s1 the data archive was generally characterized by high quality data with less than 2 missing daily rainfall data to the total records for the valid years table s1 3 methodology extreme return levels characterizing the examined period are quantified using the smev approach which assumes stationarity we consider potential non stationarity in extremes by computing trends in model parameters and return levels computed on a yearly basis sec 3 3 potential non stationarity can be thus considered in the model by combining the detected trends with the stationary model 3 1 statistical formulation the smev formulation marra et al 2019 2020 was applied to estimate the parameters of the weibull distribution and the quantiles of extreme rainfalls with 2 5 10 20 50 and 100 year return periods recent studies e g wilson and toumi 2005 papalexiou et al 2018 miniussi and marra 2021 have shown that the tails of ordinary precipitation events across diverse climatic conditions are well modelled using a weibull distribution with the following cumulative distribution function 1 f x λ κ 1 e x λ κ where λ 0 and κ 0 are the scale and shape parameters respectively the scale parameter by definition equally scales the magnitudes of the events at all probabilities while the shape parameter is associated to the tail heaviness larger shape parameters represent a lighter upper tail of the distribution and vice versa this leads to a three parameter description λ κ n of the extreme value distribution with two parameters describing the intensity of the ordinary events λ κ and one representing the average number of yearly occurrences of the ordinary events n 2 g x f x λ κ n marra et al 2019 demonstrated that the year to year variations of n are negligible and therefore not an important factor of variability in the estimation of extreme quantiles in order to focus on the tail of the intensity distribution for our weibull model see wilson and toumi 2005 we left censored the daily rainfall data using a case dependent threshold marra et al 2019 this approach is equivalent to ordinary statistics of finite size block maxima serinaldi et al 2020 and should not be confused with traditional threshold exceedance methods as no asymptotic behaviour is required different definitions of the tail were tested using the monte carlo based hypothesis test method presented in marra et al 2020 and described in the following 1 a portion of the data was defined to be the tail for instance the data between the 50th and the 100th percentiles i e the upper half of the wet days 2 the parameters of the weibull distribution were computed by censoring i e ignoring their quantitative value but retaining their weight in probability see marani and ignaccolo 2015 and marra et al 2020 a all the data points below the nth percentile and b all the annual maxima 3 103 synthetic samples from the estimated weibull distribution were drawn 4 the observed annual maxima were compared to the sampled annual maxima to check whether the assumption of having a weibull tail could be rejected that is whether more than 5 of the annual maxima lie outside of the 95 sampling confidence interval the test was repeated at each station for many thresholds to check the optimal portion of data representing the tail eq 1 this optimal value see fig 3 represents the percentile that defines the upper tail of the distribution that here is represented by the portion of data that can be described using a two parameter weibull distribution it should be noted that by definition see marra et al 2019 a threshold is optimal when the estimated parameters of the distribution have no sensitivity to small changes of its value it is worth pointing out that for the sake of this test the significant temporal changes we find in some of the parameters sec 4 3 2 are negligible this test ensures in a fully independent way that the observed annual maxima are likely samples from our model statistics since thresholds are climatic properties we defined the thresholds once for each region to estimate the model parameters the data were left censored and the annual maxima values were retained for the parameter estimation 3 2 quantification of uncertainties we quantified and compared the uncertainties associated with the use of smev and the traditional extreme value analysis methodology in relation to the use of short records of rainfall 5 year 10 year 20 year to estimate the quantiles of extreme return levels 20 year 50 year 100 year the extreme value analysis is here exemplified using a generalized extreme value gev fit of the observed annual maxima using the method of the l moments hosking 1990 it is worth noting that past studies have shown that under realistic conditions no appreciable advantage over this gev application is obtained using traditional threshold exceedance methods schlögl and laaha 2017 marra et al 2018 hu et al 2020 metzger et al 2020 following overeem et al 2008 the uncertainty related to the frequency analyses was quantified using bootstrap with replacement of the short record years out of the full records 103 repetitions in this case we could quantify the uncertainty taking into consideration the statistical characteristics as well as the length years of the available rainfall data here we focused on the 22 synoptic stations with relatively less than 1 of missing data table s1 these include savannah 5 stations transition 3 forest 9 and coastal 5 3 3 temporal trend analysis past studies showed that the large stochastic uncertainties characterizing extremes may limit the applicability of nonstationary methods serinaldi and kilsby 2015 fatichi et al 2016 tabari 2021 in order to address this issue we evaluate the possible presence of temporal changes in the occurrence and characteristics of the ordinary events by examining changes at the local and regional scales and we express them as relative changes with respect to the long term quantities obtained assuming stationarity following dallan et al 2022 the presence of temporal trends was investigated on a selection of 48 stations with at least 34 years of daily data in the common period 1978 2018 fig 1 by applying the model on a yearly basis for each station we obtained the yearly series of distribution parameters scale λ and shape κ number of rainy days n and the estimated quantiles for different return periods to do so we used the left censoring thresholds already defined based on the full data records the yearly series of annual maxima am were then extracted from the observations monotonic temporal trends in these quantities were analysed at the individual locations stations using the mann kendall test at 0 05 significance level mann 1945 kendall 1975 and quantifying the rate of change through the nonparametric sen s slope estimator sen 1968 since auto correlation within the series was found not negligible for some of them we used a pre whitening procedure before the mk test in order to obtain a correct evaluation of the significance level p value for the trend test the at site trend test allows to evaluate the spatial variability of trends and to analyse if the significant trends are located in specific hot spots we also investigated monotonic temporal trends at the regional scale using a regional mann kendall test helsel and frans 2006 at 0 05 significance level testing if the analysed variable temporally changes in a consistent same direction within a region and providing an overall measure of the trend slope since the presence of serial correlation among the series that is spatial correlation when series are locations could affect the evaluation of the significance of trends the test was performed according to the correlation correction proposed by hirsch and slack 1984 another source of misleading results is the heterogeneity of trends trends with opposite directions at the different locations and we detected heterogeneity of trend patterns by applying the chi squared test proposed by van belle and hughes 1984 only results for homogeneous regions were considered in this study the regional trend analysis was firstly applied to i whole ghana ii the four hydroclimatic zones and iii two zones characterized by a different rainfall pattern unimodal and bimodal the results showed that those regions are not homogeneous fig s1 the visual analysis of the maps of the at site trends revealed some homogeneous patterns in the trends which seem related to altitude and spatial proximity three new regions were then identified herein refer to as altitudinal regions and the homogeneity and regional trend test were then applied to iv the three altitudinal regions fig 1 detailed explanation of the demarcation of iv is given in the results section the regional trend test results for ii and iii are reported in fig s1 it is worth noting that systematic biases in the estimated tail heaviness are expected when parameters are estimated on a yearly basis using relatively high left censoring thresholds as in our case our results will rely on the assumption that this systematic bias depends on the sample size since the number of wet days is not changing significantly see fig 10 we can assume this bias to be stationary and safely quantify trends using relative changes 4 results 4 1 evaluation of the statistical method 4 1 1 definition of the ordinary events tail the spatial pattern of the optimal values for the definition of the left censoring threshold fig 3 generally shows a north to south gradient mean standard deviation optimal values of 0 56 0 11 0 57 0 24 0 60 0 22 and 0 79 0 07 were observed for savannah transition forest and coastal zones respectively to decrease the impact of stochastic uncertainties at each zone we adopted a regional value that best represents the upper tail of the distribution of the ordinary events based on the distribution in fig 3 we chose thresholds of 60 percentile for savannah and transition zones and 85 and 80 percentiles for forest and coastal zones respectively meaning that the remaining 15 40 of the ordinary events well represent the upper tail for the stations in the study region as expected sensitivity analyses based on the datasets showed that left censoring values between at site thresholds and regional thresholds provide indistinguishable results the estimation of the parameters of the distribution of the ordinary events scale and shape fig 5 were therefore based on these regional thresholds results of our test imply that even when annual maxima are not used to estimate the parameters the smev model is able to reproduce their distribution see marra et al 2020 4 1 2 assessment and comparison of uncertainties between the smev and extreme value approaches the performance of the smev and gev formulations to estimate extreme return levels 20 year 50 year 100 year rainfall quantiles from short data records 5 year 10 year and 20 year was evaluated using bootstrap with replacement at the 22 synoptic stations fig 4 the relationship between the coefficients of variations cv represented by the ratios of the standard deviations and the mean of the rainfall quantiles shows that the smev generally outperformed the gev distribution this implies that the estimated rainfall quantiles from the smev distribution are more precise whereas there is greater uncertainty with the use of the gev distribution with 5 years of data fig 4a the smev approach quantified 20 50 and 100 year return levels with largely reduced 10 21 10 23 and 11 24 uncertainties compared to 14 32 17 54 and 23 88 of the gev method respectively similarly with 10 years of data fig 4b the smev quantified the three extreme return levels with 7 15 7 16 and 7 17 uncertainties compared to 8 26 9 43 and 11 62 of the gev respectively and with 20 years of data fig 4c the smev quantified the return levels with 5 10 5 11 and 5 11 uncertainties compared to 5 20 6 33 and 7 46 of the gev respectively 4 2 climatic and altitudinal controls on extreme rainfall statistics 4 2 1 spatial patterns of the model parameters and daily rainfall quantiles the spatial distribution of the scale parameters of the ordinary events distribution fig 5a showed a decreasing gradient moving from north to south this means that the typical magnitude of intense daily precipitation amounts tends to increase with latitude the spatial distribution of the shape parameters fig 5b also shows a similar gradient which implies that the upper tail of the distribution is lighter at higher latitudes mean standard deviation scale parameters of 13 2 mm 2 0 mm 12 2 mm 1 3 mm 11 2 mm 1 5 mm and 9 3 mm 1 4 mm and shape parameters of 0 87 0 04 0 85 0 07 0 81 0 06 and 0 69 0 05 were observed for savannah transition forest and coastal zones respectively the average number of wet days fig 5c on the other hand increased from savannah through the transition to the forest zone and decreased in the coastal zone in fact the number of wet days were similar along the eastern coast coastal and the dry northern savannah zones mean standard deviation yearly occurrences of 79 days 10 days 96 days 9 days 115 days 19 days and 80 days 16 days were observed for savannah transition forest and coastal zones respectively the spatial distribution of the rainfall quantiles generally increased from northern to southern ghana fig 6 mean standard deviation for 2 year rainfall quantiles fig 6a of 78 3 mm 5 3 mm 81 2 mm 9 7 mm 85 5 mm 16 3 mm and 89 4 mm 6 1 mm were observed for savannah transition forest and coastal zones respectively as a measure of the smev tail heaviness we found that the 10 year rainfall quantiles in the four regions fig 6b are 46 7 47 1 48 6 and 63 1 larger than the 2 year rainfall quantiles respectively the 100 year rainfall quantiles fig 6c on the other hand are 41 7 42 6 44 3 and 56 1 larger than the 10 year rainfall quantiles respectively generally higher rainfall quantiles were observed along the coast both coastal zone and along the western coast of the forest zone regions along the volta river in the forest transition and savannah zones also present high rainfall quantiles relative to the respective climatic zones 4 2 2 climatic dependence of model parameters and extreme daily rainfall quantiles we evaluated the climatic dependence of the model parameters and extreme rainfall quantiles based on the latitudinal lines fig 7 the parameters show evident latitudinal gradients with increasing scale and shape parameters fig 7a and b and decreasing number of wet days fig 7c with latitude extreme rainfall quantiles fig 7d e follow a well established latitudinal organization with decreasing quantiles at increasing latitude the scale and shape parameters increased at an average gradient of 0 55 mm and 0 027 per degree of latitude respectively whereas the average number of yearly wet days decreased at an average gradient of 7 days year per degree of latitude the rainfall quantiles on the other hand decreased at average gradients of 4 mm 7 mm and 12 mm per degree of latitude for the 2 10 and 100 year quantiles respectively this is supported by the significance of the regression lines p 0 05 in all cases indicating that the slopes of the regressions are significantly different from zero the explained variances r2 are however relatively low with 30 of the variance in the shape parameter and less than 25 of the variance in the scale parameter and number of yearly wet days explained by latitude alone similarly latitude explains approximately 18 20 and 21 of the variance in the 2 10 and 100 year quantiles respectively 4 2 3 altitudinal dependence of the model parameters and daily rainfall quantiles we also elucidated the dependence of the model parameters and quantiles on altitude fig 8 the elevations of the various climatic regions are not well organised so that the two quantities latitude and elevation are rather independent the stations in the savannah and transition zones lie well within altitudes 158 313 and 115 323 m a s l respectively whereas those within the coastal zone lie within altitudes 4 78 m a s l the stations in the forest zone on the other hand are spread over the elevation range of the other zones from altitude 8 to 600 m a s l fig 8 shows that the only parameter with a statistically significant relation with elevation is the shape parameter of the ordinary events distribution fig 8b 20 of explained variance which drives the distribution tail heaviness and thus the extreme rainfall quantiles fig 8d f the shape parameter increased at an average gradient of 0 0003 per metre of altitude whereas the rainfall quantiles decreased at average gradients of 0 046 0 091 and 0 162 mm per metre of altitude for the 2 10 and 100 year quantiles respectively the corresponding explained variance r2 for the regressions with the rainfall quantiles increased marginally from lower to higher quantiles with approximately 21 25 and 27 for 2 10 and 100 year quantiles respectively the three stations along the western coast and in the forest zone mentioned above are characterised by the lowest latitudes fig 7 and altitudes fig 8 a combination of which produced the largest uncertainties especially in the estimation of the rainfall quantiles fig 8d f 4 3 temporal trends of model parameters and daily rainfall quantiles 4 3 1 at site trend analysis at site mann kendall trend test results for the observed annual maxima am the modelled am the yearly number of wet days and the weibull distribution parameters scale and shape are reported in fig 9 the modelled am series are obtained at each station by using the yearly estimated 2 year return level i e the theoretical median of the annual maxima the observed and modelled am exhibit both increasing and decreasing temporal trends with a quite similar spatial distribution and a fraction of significant trends lower than the 0 05 α level as such these significant trends could just represent stochastic noise comparing fig 9d and e we can state that the model qualitatively well reproduces the observations the number of wet days fig 9c shows a percentage of significant trends higher than 5 18 8 increasing 10 4 decreasing and some spatial patterns more stations with increasing trends are in the southern part of ghana between the coastal and forest zones and in the northern and central eastern part savannah and eastern transition zone while decreasing trends are mostly located in a central area between forest and transition the scale parameter exhibits an 8 3 of stations with a significant decreasing trend and a few stations with a significant increasing trend looking at the spatial distribution fig 9a most of the decreasing trends are located in the southern in the northern and in the central eastern parts of ghana while increasing trends are mainly located in the central western area this zoning is similar to the one observed for the yearly number of wet days the shape parameter fig 9b only shows decreasing significant trends 8 3 of stations the spatial distribution of the trends in the shape parameter is similar to the zoning emerging from what is observed for both the scale and the number of wet days 4 3 2 regional trend analysis based on altitudinal regions the fact that similar spatial patterns are observed for the trends of the different model parameters and that these patterns do not follow the latitudinal hydro climatic regions nor the two rainfall pattern zones fig s1 suggests that changes in the hydrometeorological features leading to extremes might be driven by different factors from the elevation map of ghana fig 1 we note that the southern northern and central eastern parts are characterized by lower altitudes while the central western area is dominated by elevations exceeding 200 m a s l by combining these altitudinal features with the observed patterns in the trends fig 9 we organized the stations in three new regions in order to better examine the possible temporal trends in a regional framework i the coastal basins the low elevation part south of the hills ii the hilly region the central part with elevation higher than 200 m a s l iii the volta basins the region to the north of the hills for the most part below 200 m a s l and corresponding to the catchment area of the volta lake this demarcation is reported in dash black lines in fig 1 altitudinal regions and in fig 9 trend direction patterns the regional trend slopes are estimated on the variables normalized according to their median value and are reported in units of percent per year fig 10 ghana as a whole fig 10 a has non homogeneous trends in the distribution parameters but homogeneous increasing quantiles no significant regional trend emerges for the region as a whole homogeneity is better verified for the three regions where only the number of wet days has no homogeneous trend in two zones this implies that the daily precipitation intensity distribution is changing homogeneously in the regions indicating a possible local impact on the way daily precipitation amounts change conversely the non homogeneity of the change in the number of wet days indicates that changes in this variable is likely dominated by other factors the distribution parameters and the estimated quantiles exhibit homogeneity in the trends for all the regions this allows us to make some careful considerations about the regional trend test results in the coastal basins and the volta basin regions fig 10b and d respectively both the parameters show decreasing temporal trends with increasing trends in the quantiles the trend slopes for the estimated quantiles are in the range 0 15 0 19 and 0 25 0 44 per year for the coastal basins and the volta basin regions respectively also the annual maxima have a trend slope of about 0 14 per year for the coastal basin region the regional trends are significant at the 0 05 α level in the volta basin region for the scale and shape parameters as well as all the rainfall quantiles with weak increasing trend for the annual maxima the hilly region fig 10c has almost opposite trends in comparison to the other two regions both model parameters show increasing significant trends with non significant decreasing trends for the rainfall quantiles we notice here a discordant behaviour between the trends in the quantiles and the annual maxima which is increasing but not significant 5 discussion 5 1 performance of the statistical formulation and implications for deriving rainfall quantiles in other tropical regions the köppen geiger climate classification peel et al 2007 demarcates the entire african continent into three distinctive climates arid 57 2 northern africa parts of east and south africa tropical 31 west central and part of east africa and temperate 11 8 south africa and part of east africa the climate of our study region is predominantly tropical insert of fig 1 similar to the climate stretching from the atlantic ocean in west africa through central africa to east africa long term changes in ssa rainfall have been shown to follow the same spatial patterns as the köppen geiger climate classification especially for the tropical region harrison et al 2019 moreover the tropical west africa sub region is characterised by lack of adequate in situ observations with highly indistinguishable rainfall climatology and interannual variability among observational datasets quagraine et al 2020 generally in our study the uncertainties increased with decreasing record years of data for the bootstrap method as well as increasing return levels of extreme rainfall quantiles these increases in uncertainties were however found to be larger for the extreme value approach compared to our statistical approach fig 4 our approach proved able to quantify extreme rainfall return levels with largely reduced uncertainty with respect to traditional extreme value methods about 7 17 to quantify 100 year rainfall quantile using 10 years of record data in at site application compared to 11 62 of the gev approach fig 4 this comes as a result of the strength of the smev formulation that uses a very large number of data points for estimating the model parameters 15 40 of the yearly wet days which in the region is about 20 times larger than the number of annual maxima similar results have been reported by zorzetto et al 2016 who recorded an average mev error of the order of 50 60 the average gev estimation error when used to obtain estimates for return periods exceeding the length of the sample used to fit the distribution large uncertainties have been reported for the shape parameter of the gev approach in the west africa sub region panthou et al 2012 this parameter is very important because of its high sensitivity and the important role it plays in estimating extreme return levels clearly the quantitative accuracy of our estimates depends on the validity of our assumption concerning the stretched exponential tail of the ordinary events distribution in this study we adopted a specific test to assess whether the assumption was correct and found the stretched exponential tail model to be appropriate throughout the region compared to other regions the left censoring thresholds we found appropriate to identify the tail of the ordinary events distribution 60th 85th percentiles is rather low slightly lower than the ones found for mediterranean and semiarid arid climates in the eastern mediterranean 75th percentiles marra et al 2019 2020 and significantly lower than the ones found for continental climates 90th percentile miniussi and marra 2021 this confirms previous indications that convective like precipitation might be better described by a stretched exponential tail while stratiform like precipitation might be associated with heavier tails e g berg et al 2013 although this hypothesis deserves further research efforts our study demonstrates the implications of our approach to model and quantify extreme rainfall quantiles in data sparse tropical regions with reduced uncertainties in particular this is important when extreme value models are linked to flood generating processes for future projection of flood risk in these regions e g tramblay et al 2014 5 2 dependence of the model parameters and daily rainfall quantiles on latitudes and elevation the analysis revealed that the tail model parameters scale and shape the number of yearly wet days as well as the extreme rainfall quantiles fig 7 follow a well established latitudinal organization and hence significantly depend on latitude coincidentally the four hydro climatic regions adopted in the area savannah transition forest and coastal are well layered latitudinally and thus well represent these spatial variations whereas the parameters of the daily intensity distribution tail scale and shape parameters both increase with latitude the number of wet days and the extreme rainfall quantiles decrease with increasing latitudes in response to the decreased tail heaviness increasing shape parameter empirical observation of the relationship between the scale and shape parameters shows a log linear model fig s2 similar to what was reported by marra et al 2021a for mediterranean and arid climates higher correlations between the parameters were however observed for the savannah and transition zones compared to the forest and coastal zones fig s2a and for the volta basin and the hilly regions compared to the coastal basins fig s2b this phenomenon can be attributed to the latitudinal extents of the regions of interest fig 7 this latitudinally well organized spatial variation was however not observed by panthou et al 2012 especially for the parameters of the daily rainfall distribution these authors reported a pattern for the relationship between daily intensity distribution and latitude for the west africa sub region but were characterized by significant estimation uncertainties this can be ascribed to the spatial extent of their study area ranging between latitudes 10on and 15on and longitude 10ow and 5ow compared to the extent of our study area latitudes 4 5on and 11on and longitude 3ow and 1ow clearly our study region covered a large latitudinal extent compared to that of panthou et al 2012 and vice versa in relation to longitudinal extent in addition to this however the estimation uncertainties characterizing the adopted methods clearly played a significant role this latitudinal gradient supports the latitudinally organized köppen geiger climate classification for the subregion peel et al 2007 spatial patterns of extreme rainfall quantiles fig 6 are similar to that reported by panthou et al 2012 and the modelled summer monsoon monthly rainfall characteristics quagraine et al 2020 which decrease latitudinally from the coast to the sahel region in west africa stations along the coast and the volta river generally recorded high rainfall qualities which can be attributed to the influence of moisture fluxes from the river bodies significant dependence with the elevation emerges only for the shape parameters which drives the dependence for the estimated quantiles fig 8 similar to the spatial pattern with latitudes the shape parameter increases with elevation whereas the extreme rainfall quantiles decrease with increasing elevation fig 8e f this is interesting because intuitively we expect orographic enhancement to increase rainfall as a function of elevation e g avanzi et al 2015 marra et al 2021a however mean daily rainfall amounts do not show any significant relationship with elevation it is also worth noting that low elevation regions 200 m a s l are characterised by relatively high and variable mean daily rainfall amounts 9 9 19 8 mm compared to high elevation regions 10 2 14 1 mm clearly the well organized relationship between the shape parameters and elevation fig 8b has a larger impact on estimating high rainfall return levels e g panthou et al 2012 altitude however has been shown to mostly affect the temporal trends of the parameter rather than their value as discussed in the next section 5 3 temporal trends of the model parameters and rainfall quantiles many recent studies used a regional scale approach to investigate the field significance and the consistency of changes within a region and to detect if the local changes could indicate or not the impact of global phenomena like climate change e g renard et al 2008 yue and wang 2002 blanchet et al 2018 the regional temporal trend analysis revealed regions in which the changes in the distribution parameters and in the estimated quantiles are homogeneous and highlighted their statistical significance we found rather homogeneous increasing trends in the estimated quantiles throughout the study region although not statistically significant fig 10a these results seem to derive from non homogeneous trends in the distribution parameters the unverified homogeneity suggests the rainfall distribution changes differently within ghana and that a regional trend test based on the whole region could be misleading these findings agree with a previous study by manzanas et al 2014 they found that the annual precipitation from the rain gauge dataset exhibits no significant trend during the period 1986 2010 but with the same direction increasing among the regions contrasting results were found for trends in the annual maximum daily precipitation which showed high zonal variability by observing the presence of spatial patterns in the at site trend results and after realizing that altitude represented a good proxy for these patterns fig 9 the regional trend test was applied to the three new regions as described in section 4 3 2 the role of altitude in the rainfall changes emerged in a previous study owusu and waylen 2009 where the kwahu plateau corresponding to the higher part of the hills area demarcated in our study was found to be a divide in the extend of changes in the mean value of annual totals by comparing two periods 1951 1970 and 1981 2000 a greater reduction was found in those stations located south west to the plateau increasing trend of post 1980 annual maximum peak discharge in west africa has been attributed to intense precipitation as a result of increased thunderstorm activity associated with enhanced convective available vertical shear driven by cooling temperature trends over western africa tramblay et al 2020 with the exception of the average number of wet days which is a variable largely dependent on large scale meteorological features and characterized by large spatial correlation for two out of the three regions all the variables show homogeneous trends within each region supporting the chosen area demarcation and giving the chance to make consistent considerations on the trend test results and to explain trends in quantiles by the trends in the parameters in the coastal and volta basins which show similar direction for the trends but they are significant only for the volta basin the trends in the parameters act a synergically on the rainfall intensity distribution decreasing scale lowers the intensities among all the probabilities decreasing shape enhances the distribution tail heaviness but the heavier tail has greater effect than the decreasing scale on the estimated quantiles and this is more evident for the volta basins area the significant increasing trend in the tail heaviness results in significant increasing trends in the quantiles with slopes magnified for the rarer return levels this suggests that in the studied time period the area was characterised by changes in the features of the rainfall distribution at the daily time scale with extreme daily rainfall amounts becoming more severe also in the hilly region the trends in the parameters act a synergically on the rainfall intensity distribution but in the opposite direction with respect to the previous two regions and here the lighter tail of the distribution significant increasing shape results in decreasing quantiles the study of the temporal trend at the regional scale suggests that the direction of the temporal changes in the extreme rainfall intensities differs between regions increasing in the coastal basins region decreasing in the hilly region and significantly increasing in the volta basin region observed am show non significant positive trends for all the regions and the modelled am trends are generally in the same direction it can be noticed that the trend for the modelled am for the volta basin region is significant and higher than the observed one suggesting here a positive trend could exist but could be masked by stochastic uncertainties the regional trend analysis revealed that changes are more relevant when altitudinal regions are considered rather than the classic climatic zones these findings are important for quantification and management of hydro climatic risk in the region 6 conclusions we explored the use of statistical methods based on a large number of ordinary events which are assumed to correspond to all the wet day amounts as opposed to extremes only to improve precipitation frequency analyses in data scarce tropical regions in ssa the statistical method was applied to a relatively vast rain gauge data archive covering diverse hydro climatic regions across ghana the main findings of our study can be summarized as follows the two parameter stretched exponential weibull distribution well approximates the tail of the daily rainfall distribution throughout the area the largest 15 40 of the yearly wet days are found to belong to such tails and used for estimating the model parameters the statistical approach was able to quantify extreme return periods exceeding the length of the sample used to fit the distribution with largely reduced uncertainties compared to the extreme value based methods the tail model parameters scale and shape the number of yearly wet days and the extreme rainfall quantiles follow a well established and statistically significant latitudinal organization and hence are well described by the four latitudinally layered hydro climatic regions typically adopted in the area altitude significantly affects the tail heaviness of the daily intensity distribution and thus extreme rainfall quantiles but has no statistically significant impact on the other model parameters temporal changes during the period 1978 2018 were found to be non homogeneous within the area as well as within the four hydro climatic regions but three homogeneous regions were demarcated based on altitude regional trend tests showed contrasting trends in extreme return levels in low elevation 200 m a s l and hilly regions related to contrasting changes in the daily intensity distribution parameters significantly increasing trends in extreme daily rainfall amounts are observed in the low elevation volta basin this study represents an important step towards the modelling and quantification of the return levels of rainfall extremes in tropical regions typically characterised by lack of adequate long records of in situ observations the adopted statistical approach can be extended to the use of global or regional reanalyses and or climate models which will permit modelling of changing climatic conditions in other regions with less ground observations among the practical results the observed increasing trends in extreme daily rainfall amounts in the volta basin during 1978 2018 call for further investigation and quantification of changes in future

3201,sub saharan africa s economy and livelihood are primarily dependent on agriculture which makes it highly vulnerable to the impacts of extreme weather events and climate change modelling and quantifying extreme rainfall and its temporal changes in such environments could thus provide crucial information for design insurance management ecology and climate adaptation rain gauge networks in the area are relatively sparse and often characterized by missing data which hamper the use of extreme value methods for estimating extreme precipitation quantiles in this study we adopted the simplified metastatistical extreme value approach for the estimation of extreme return levels based on ordinary events i e all the independent realizations of the variable of interest which was shown to be more accurate than traditional extreme value methods in the presence of short data records we examined data from 66 rain gauges covering diverse hydro climatic regions across ghana with the aim of i validating the robustness of the statistical approach ii characterising the climatic and altitudinal controls on the occurrence frequency and intensity of rainfall extremes and iii quantifying recent changes in the characteristics of extremes we found that a two parameter weibull distribution well approximates the tail of the daily rainfall distribution throughout the area our statistical approach can quantify extremes with largely reduced uncertainties 7 17 uncertainty in the 100 year return levels computed using 10 years of data versus 11 62 of extreme value based methods extreme precipitation statistics daily intensity distribution number of wet days extreme rainfall quantiles are found to significantly depend on latitude so that the four latitudinally layered hydro climatic regions typically adopted in the area well represent spatial variations elevation significantly affects the tail heaviness of the daily intensity distribution and thus extreme rainfall quantiles temporal changes during the period 1978 2018 are found to be non homogeneous in the area as well as within the four hydro climatic regions but are homogeneous in three altitude based regions we report contrasting trends in extreme return levels in low elevation 200 m a s l and hilly regions related to contrasting changes in the daily intensity distribution statistically significant positive trends in extreme daily rainfall amounts are observed in the inland low elevation region of the volta river basin which call for further investigation of changes in future precipitation extremes in this extremely important hydrological region in sub saharan africa keywords extreme daily rainfall ordinary events simplified mev trend analysis volta river ghana sub saharan africa data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction climate change is modifying the occurrence frequency and intensity of hydroclimatic extremes such as droughts and floods around the globe dadson et al 2019 tegegne and melesse 2020 fowler et al 2021 this has tremendous impact on the lives and properties of populations especially in the most vulnerable regions of the world such as sub saharan africa ssa this region is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change due to the low adaptive capacity and high sensitivity of the socio economic systems ipcc 2014 for example floods in africa have caused up to 27 000 fatalities between 1950 and 2019 tramblay et al 2020 also the 2009 floods in west africa after torrential rains affected 600 000 people in sixteen west african countries with burkina faso senegal niger and ghana as the most affected countries di baldassarre et al 2010 climate change impacts in ssa have also been shown to have serious social repercussions on the population such as rural urban migration since rainfed agricultural systems on which the rural livelihoods predominantly depend are affected by prolonged droughts and uncertain rainfall patterns serdeczny et al 2017 extreme rainfalls are the major causal element of floods in the region paeth et al 2011 in fact floods usually occur during the rainy seasons and develop over relatively short temporal scales 1 3 days there have also been incidences of flash floods developing in less than 24 h with unprecedented socio economic damages especially in major cities such as accra and kumasi ansah et al 2020 investigation of the august and september 2007 widespread floods in ssa demonstrated the difficulty of delineating meteorological extreme events at a regional scale paeth et al 2011 though interannual variability of flood magnitudes in africa has been found to depend more on annual maximum soil moisture than annual maximum precipitation tramblay et al 2021 the frequency and intensity of extreme daily rainfalls as triggers of floods are of great socio economic relevance and need to be investigated information on extreme rainfall characteristics such as frequency and intensity and their temporal changes are therefore very important for guiding the design of relevant water infrastructure e g dams and reservoirs flood insurance studies flood plain management and river ecological studies and eventually directing climate adaptation and hazard mitigation strategies rainfall frequency analysis relates the magnitude of extreme events to their frequency of occurrence through the use of probability distributions these are usually fitted to the observed extremes in order to extrapolate intensities corresponding to very rare and potentially still unobserved quantiles traditionally extreme values are analysed for this purpose either using annual maxima series or the peaks exceeding a high threshold albeit based on robust theory this approach suffers from the stochastic uncertainties that characterize the sampling of extremes so that reliable estimates of rare quantiles can only be obtained when very long records are available katz et al 2002 in particular the estimation of high order statistics from limited records unavoidably leads to large uncertainties so that strong assumptions on the tail behaviour of these extreme value distributions need to be adopted for example using regionalization or scaling approaches e g buishand 1991 burlando and rosso 1996 recent findings however suggest these assumptions could be violated in regions characterized by climatic gradients caused for instance by orography avanzi et al 2015 marra et al 2021a in addition the impacts of climate change on the dynamics of rainfall extremes with significant changes in both occurrence frequency and intensity of storms can make the use of extremes annual maxima series in particular misleading in quantifying and understanding future changes in extreme quantiles e g marra et al 2019 for these reasons there have been attempts to consider a larger amount of data for improving precipitation frequency analyses e g marani and ignaccolo 2015 volpi et al 2019 serinaldi et al 2020 for example the metastatistical extreme value mev approach was shown to combine important advantages over traditional approaches in terms of decreased estimation uncertainties and reduced assumptions zorzetto et al 2016 marra et al 2018 the underlying idea is that extremes are samples from the so called ordinary events that are all the independent realizations of the process of interest in the case of daily precipitation ordinary events are usually assumed to correspond to all the wet day amounts and modelled using a two parameter weibull distribution stretched exponential marani and ignaccolo 2015 zorzetto et al 2016 miniussi et al 2020 theoretical reasoning and observations however suggest that this stretched exponential model represents only the ordinary events tail rather than their entire distribution wilson and toumi 2005 marra et al 2019 wang et al 2020 miniussi and marra 2021 thus if sufficient data are available it is possible to estimate the model parameters by focusing on the right tail of the ordinary events as first proposed in the so called simplified mev smev formulation marra et al 2019 2020 as shown by serinaldi et al 2020 this approach is equivalent to the distribution of maxima in equally sized blocks under independence and identical distribution for the sake of consistency with recent literature we will use here the term smev this approach describes extremes by utilising parameters that directly relate to the properties of the ordinary events tail the parameters of the weibull distribution and to their average yearly number of occurrences the formulation has been applied over diverse climatic settings including continental temperate mediterranean and arid semi arid climates and was validated against historical long term data e g marra et al 2019 2020 miniussi and marra 2021 it has been found to outperform traditional extreme value methods in situations in which relatively short data records are available provided that the assumed tail model is correct but no study so far explored the climatic conditions typical of ssa few studies have investigated the characteristics of extreme rainfalls in ssa panthou et al 2012 for instance modelled and mapped extreme rainfalls using a block maxima formulation in the west african sub region these authors found that extreme rain events can be very localized even for ssa regions characterized by a fairly homogeneous climate harrison et al 2019 have reported significant changes in extreme rainfall characteristics in well gauged areas of ssa between 1950 and 2013 the use of ordinary rainfall events to model return levels could thus represent an important advantage for tropical climates in ssa which are characterised by relatively limited and sparse rain gauge networks as well as the associated numerous missing data e g harrison et al 2019 quagraine et al 2020 and where rainfall is also characterized by a strong local variability especially at the rain event scale we focus here on the relatively well instrumented area of ghana with long term high quality daily in situ rainfall data archive to gather methodological and quantitative insights of general interest for ssa to the best of our knowledge no attempt has been made to ascertain the controls on rainfall extremes and their regional coherency in ssa this study therefore aims at characterising the climatic and altitudinal controls on rainfall extremes in data sparse tropical regions using the smev formulation which is based on ordinary events and are related to all the wet day amounts in the case of daily rainfalls specifically we apply smev to historical daily in situ rainfall data in ghana to i validate the robustness of the underlying assumptions in tropical climates and the relative advantage it might present with respect to traditional extreme value approaches ii qualify and quantify the climatic and altitudinal controls on the extreme rainfall statistics and quantiles and iii evaluate and investigate past temporal trends in the extreme rainfall statistics and quantiles 2 study area and data 2 1 climate of the region ghana is located in west sub saharan africa between latitudes 4 n and 12 n and longitudes 1 5 e and 3 5 w fig 1 with approximately 227 533 km2 of land area and 11 000 km2 water bodies ghana is bounded to the east by togo to the west by ivory coast to the north by burkina faso and the south by the gulf of guinea part of the atlantic ocean the climate is characterised as tropical similar to many parts of the subregion according to the köppen geiger climate classification blue shades in the inset of fig 1 the climate is usually organized into four main zones as we move from north to south savannah transition forest and coastal zones amekudzi et al 2015 these zones can be roughly defined by latitudinal lines although there is a latitudinal overlap between the forest and the coastal zone since the western coast is classified as part of the forest climatic zone fig 1 the rainfall regime is characterized by dry and wet seasons which are modulated by the intertropical boundary and the two main high pressure systems namely the st helena high pressure system located in the southern hemisphere and the azores high pressure system located over the atlantic ocean ansah et al 2020 fig 2 reports the mean monthly rainfall seasonality with standard deviation shown as error bars representing inter station variability within each zone for the unimodal pattern of the savannah zone monthly rainfall values of above 100 mm are observed from may to september with a peak in august fig 2 the bimodal rainfall patterns are similar from january to june when the first rain season peaks the forest zone observes maximum rainfall during this period compared to the transition and coastal zones monthly rainfalls for all the three zones with bimodal patterns decrease from june to august and increase again for september and october the dynamics is however different for the second rainfall peak where the transition zone peaks in september whereas the forest and coastal zones peak in october in fact the transition zone records higher monthly mean rainfall in the second peak in september compared to the first peak in june fig 2 low rainfall values are consistently recorded from november to march for all the climatic zones 2 2 data and quality control historic daily in situ rainfall data for the period 1960 2018 from 73 stations across the four climatic zones of ghana were obtained from the ghana meteorological agency gmet for the purpose of this study gmet controls the quality of the data using the clidata software www clidata cz these include 22 synoptic stations with daily rainfall data and other climatic data temperature relative humidity sunshine hours wind speed and direction and cloud cover and 51 stations with only daily rainfall amounts fig 1 table s1 the stations were screened based on their record length and data quality and stations were retained for the study according to the following criteria i years with less than 10 of missing data were considered as valid ii stations with record length of at least 30 valid years were retained from the criteria 66 out of the 73 stations were considered covering savannah 12 stations transition 10 forest 37 and coastal 7 zones fig 1 table s1 for the purposes of the trend analysis the data was further screened to only consider stations with at least 34 years of data in the common period 1978 2018 this criterion allows to have long records for a robust temporal trend analysis a common coverage period and a widespread spatial coverage this reduced the dataset to 48 out of the 66 stations covering savannah 10 transition 7 forest 24 and coastal 7 zones fig 1 table s1 the data archive was generally characterized by high quality data with less than 2 missing daily rainfall data to the total records for the valid years table s1 3 methodology extreme return levels characterizing the examined period are quantified using the smev approach which assumes stationarity we consider potential non stationarity in extremes by computing trends in model parameters and return levels computed on a yearly basis sec 3 3 potential non stationarity can be thus considered in the model by combining the detected trends with the stationary model 3 1 statistical formulation the smev formulation marra et al 2019 2020 was applied to estimate the parameters of the weibull distribution and the quantiles of extreme rainfalls with 2 5 10 20 50 and 100 year return periods recent studies e g wilson and toumi 2005 papalexiou et al 2018 miniussi and marra 2021 have shown that the tails of ordinary precipitation events across diverse climatic conditions are well modelled using a weibull distribution with the following cumulative distribution function 1 f x λ κ 1 e x λ κ where λ 0 and κ 0 are the scale and shape parameters respectively the scale parameter by definition equally scales the magnitudes of the events at all probabilities while the shape parameter is associated to the tail heaviness larger shape parameters represent a lighter upper tail of the distribution and vice versa this leads to a three parameter description λ κ n of the extreme value distribution with two parameters describing the intensity of the ordinary events λ κ and one representing the average number of yearly occurrences of the ordinary events n 2 g x f x λ κ n marra et al 2019 demonstrated that the year to year variations of n are negligible and therefore not an important factor of variability in the estimation of extreme quantiles in order to focus on the tail of the intensity distribution for our weibull model see wilson and toumi 2005 we left censored the daily rainfall data using a case dependent threshold marra et al 2019 this approach is equivalent to ordinary statistics of finite size block maxima serinaldi et al 2020 and should not be confused with traditional threshold exceedance methods as no asymptotic behaviour is required different definitions of the tail were tested using the monte carlo based hypothesis test method presented in marra et al 2020 and described in the following 1 a portion of the data was defined to be the tail for instance the data between the 50th and the 100th percentiles i e the upper half of the wet days 2 the parameters of the weibull distribution were computed by censoring i e ignoring their quantitative value but retaining their weight in probability see marani and ignaccolo 2015 and marra et al 2020 a all the data points below the nth percentile and b all the annual maxima 3 103 synthetic samples from the estimated weibull distribution were drawn 4 the observed annual maxima were compared to the sampled annual maxima to check whether the assumption of having a weibull tail could be rejected that is whether more than 5 of the annual maxima lie outside of the 95 sampling confidence interval the test was repeated at each station for many thresholds to check the optimal portion of data representing the tail eq 1 this optimal value see fig 3 represents the percentile that defines the upper tail of the distribution that here is represented by the portion of data that can be described using a two parameter weibull distribution it should be noted that by definition see marra et al 2019 a threshold is optimal when the estimated parameters of the distribution have no sensitivity to small changes of its value it is worth pointing out that for the sake of this test the significant temporal changes we find in some of the parameters sec 4 3 2 are negligible this test ensures in a fully independent way that the observed annual maxima are likely samples from our model statistics since thresholds are climatic properties we defined the thresholds once for each region to estimate the model parameters the data were left censored and the annual maxima values were retained for the parameter estimation 3 2 quantification of uncertainties we quantified and compared the uncertainties associated with the use of smev and the traditional extreme value analysis methodology in relation to the use of short records of rainfall 5 year 10 year 20 year to estimate the quantiles of extreme return levels 20 year 50 year 100 year the extreme value analysis is here exemplified using a generalized extreme value gev fit of the observed annual maxima using the method of the l moments hosking 1990 it is worth noting that past studies have shown that under realistic conditions no appreciable advantage over this gev application is obtained using traditional threshold exceedance methods schlögl and laaha 2017 marra et al 2018 hu et al 2020 metzger et al 2020 following overeem et al 2008 the uncertainty related to the frequency analyses was quantified using bootstrap with replacement of the short record years out of the full records 103 repetitions in this case we could quantify the uncertainty taking into consideration the statistical characteristics as well as the length years of the available rainfall data here we focused on the 22 synoptic stations with relatively less than 1 of missing data table s1 these include savannah 5 stations transition 3 forest 9 and coastal 5 3 3 temporal trend analysis past studies showed that the large stochastic uncertainties characterizing extremes may limit the applicability of nonstationary methods serinaldi and kilsby 2015 fatichi et al 2016 tabari 2021 in order to address this issue we evaluate the possible presence of temporal changes in the occurrence and characteristics of the ordinary events by examining changes at the local and regional scales and we express them as relative changes with respect to the long term quantities obtained assuming stationarity following dallan et al 2022 the presence of temporal trends was investigated on a selection of 48 stations with at least 34 years of daily data in the common period 1978 2018 fig 1 by applying the model on a yearly basis for each station we obtained the yearly series of distribution parameters scale λ and shape κ number of rainy days n and the estimated quantiles for different return periods to do so we used the left censoring thresholds already defined based on the full data records the yearly series of annual maxima am were then extracted from the observations monotonic temporal trends in these quantities were analysed at the individual locations stations using the mann kendall test at 0 05 significance level mann 1945 kendall 1975 and quantifying the rate of change through the nonparametric sen s slope estimator sen 1968 since auto correlation within the series was found not negligible for some of them we used a pre whitening procedure before the mk test in order to obtain a correct evaluation of the significance level p value for the trend test the at site trend test allows to evaluate the spatial variability of trends and to analyse if the significant trends are located in specific hot spots we also investigated monotonic temporal trends at the regional scale using a regional mann kendall test helsel and frans 2006 at 0 05 significance level testing if the analysed variable temporally changes in a consistent same direction within a region and providing an overall measure of the trend slope since the presence of serial correlation among the series that is spatial correlation when series are locations could affect the evaluation of the significance of trends the test was performed according to the correlation correction proposed by hirsch and slack 1984 another source of misleading results is the heterogeneity of trends trends with opposite directions at the different locations and we detected heterogeneity of trend patterns by applying the chi squared test proposed by van belle and hughes 1984 only results for homogeneous regions were considered in this study the regional trend analysis was firstly applied to i whole ghana ii the four hydroclimatic zones and iii two zones characterized by a different rainfall pattern unimodal and bimodal the results showed that those regions are not homogeneous fig s1 the visual analysis of the maps of the at site trends revealed some homogeneous patterns in the trends which seem related to altitude and spatial proximity three new regions were then identified herein refer to as altitudinal regions and the homogeneity and regional trend test were then applied to iv the three altitudinal regions fig 1 detailed explanation of the demarcation of iv is given in the results section the regional trend test results for ii and iii are reported in fig s1 it is worth noting that systematic biases in the estimated tail heaviness are expected when parameters are estimated on a yearly basis using relatively high left censoring thresholds as in our case our results will rely on the assumption that this systematic bias depends on the sample size since the number of wet days is not changing significantly see fig 10 we can assume this bias to be stationary and safely quantify trends using relative changes 4 results 4 1 evaluation of the statistical method 4 1 1 definition of the ordinary events tail the spatial pattern of the optimal values for the definition of the left censoring threshold fig 3 generally shows a north to south gradient mean standard deviation optimal values of 0 56 0 11 0 57 0 24 0 60 0 22 and 0 79 0 07 were observed for savannah transition forest and coastal zones respectively to decrease the impact of stochastic uncertainties at each zone we adopted a regional value that best represents the upper tail of the distribution of the ordinary events based on the distribution in fig 3 we chose thresholds of 60 percentile for savannah and transition zones and 85 and 80 percentiles for forest and coastal zones respectively meaning that the remaining 15 40 of the ordinary events well represent the upper tail for the stations in the study region as expected sensitivity analyses based on the datasets showed that left censoring values between at site thresholds and regional thresholds provide indistinguishable results the estimation of the parameters of the distribution of the ordinary events scale and shape fig 5 were therefore based on these regional thresholds results of our test imply that even when annual maxima are not used to estimate the parameters the smev model is able to reproduce their distribution see marra et al 2020 4 1 2 assessment and comparison of uncertainties between the smev and extreme value approaches the performance of the smev and gev formulations to estimate extreme return levels 20 year 50 year 100 year rainfall quantiles from short data records 5 year 10 year and 20 year was evaluated using bootstrap with replacement at the 22 synoptic stations fig 4 the relationship between the coefficients of variations cv represented by the ratios of the standard deviations and the mean of the rainfall quantiles shows that the smev generally outperformed the gev distribution this implies that the estimated rainfall quantiles from the smev distribution are more precise whereas there is greater uncertainty with the use of the gev distribution with 5 years of data fig 4a the smev approach quantified 20 50 and 100 year return levels with largely reduced 10 21 10 23 and 11 24 uncertainties compared to 14 32 17 54 and 23 88 of the gev method respectively similarly with 10 years of data fig 4b the smev quantified the three extreme return levels with 7 15 7 16 and 7 17 uncertainties compared to 8 26 9 43 and 11 62 of the gev respectively and with 20 years of data fig 4c the smev quantified the return levels with 5 10 5 11 and 5 11 uncertainties compared to 5 20 6 33 and 7 46 of the gev respectively 4 2 climatic and altitudinal controls on extreme rainfall statistics 4 2 1 spatial patterns of the model parameters and daily rainfall quantiles the spatial distribution of the scale parameters of the ordinary events distribution fig 5a showed a decreasing gradient moving from north to south this means that the typical magnitude of intense daily precipitation amounts tends to increase with latitude the spatial distribution of the shape parameters fig 5b also shows a similar gradient which implies that the upper tail of the distribution is lighter at higher latitudes mean standard deviation scale parameters of 13 2 mm 2 0 mm 12 2 mm 1 3 mm 11 2 mm 1 5 mm and 9 3 mm 1 4 mm and shape parameters of 0 87 0 04 0 85 0 07 0 81 0 06 and 0 69 0 05 were observed for savannah transition forest and coastal zones respectively the average number of wet days fig 5c on the other hand increased from savannah through the transition to the forest zone and decreased in the coastal zone in fact the number of wet days were similar along the eastern coast coastal and the dry northern savannah zones mean standard deviation yearly occurrences of 79 days 10 days 96 days 9 days 115 days 19 days and 80 days 16 days were observed for savannah transition forest and coastal zones respectively the spatial distribution of the rainfall quantiles generally increased from northern to southern ghana fig 6 mean standard deviation for 2 year rainfall quantiles fig 6a of 78 3 mm 5 3 mm 81 2 mm 9 7 mm 85 5 mm 16 3 mm and 89 4 mm 6 1 mm were observed for savannah transition forest and coastal zones respectively as a measure of the smev tail heaviness we found that the 10 year rainfall quantiles in the four regions fig 6b are 46 7 47 1 48 6 and 63 1 larger than the 2 year rainfall quantiles respectively the 100 year rainfall quantiles fig 6c on the other hand are 41 7 42 6 44 3 and 56 1 larger than the 10 year rainfall quantiles respectively generally higher rainfall quantiles were observed along the coast both coastal zone and along the western coast of the forest zone regions along the volta river in the forest transition and savannah zones also present high rainfall quantiles relative to the respective climatic zones 4 2 2 climatic dependence of model parameters and extreme daily rainfall quantiles we evaluated the climatic dependence of the model parameters and extreme rainfall quantiles based on the latitudinal lines fig 7 the parameters show evident latitudinal gradients with increasing scale and shape parameters fig 7a and b and decreasing number of wet days fig 7c with latitude extreme rainfall quantiles fig 7d e follow a well established latitudinal organization with decreasing quantiles at increasing latitude the scale and shape parameters increased at an average gradient of 0 55 mm and 0 027 per degree of latitude respectively whereas the average number of yearly wet days decreased at an average gradient of 7 days year per degree of latitude the rainfall quantiles on the other hand decreased at average gradients of 4 mm 7 mm and 12 mm per degree of latitude for the 2 10 and 100 year quantiles respectively this is supported by the significance of the regression lines p 0 05 in all cases indicating that the slopes of the regressions are significantly different from zero the explained variances r2 are however relatively low with 30 of the variance in the shape parameter and less than 25 of the variance in the scale parameter and number of yearly wet days explained by latitude alone similarly latitude explains approximately 18 20 and 21 of the variance in the 2 10 and 100 year quantiles respectively 4 2 3 altitudinal dependence of the model parameters and daily rainfall quantiles we also elucidated the dependence of the model parameters and quantiles on altitude fig 8 the elevations of the various climatic regions are not well organised so that the two quantities latitude and elevation are rather independent the stations in the savannah and transition zones lie well within altitudes 158 313 and 115 323 m a s l respectively whereas those within the coastal zone lie within altitudes 4 78 m a s l the stations in the forest zone on the other hand are spread over the elevation range of the other zones from altitude 8 to 600 m a s l fig 8 shows that the only parameter with a statistically significant relation with elevation is the shape parameter of the ordinary events distribution fig 8b 20 of explained variance which drives the distribution tail heaviness and thus the extreme rainfall quantiles fig 8d f the shape parameter increased at an average gradient of 0 0003 per metre of altitude whereas the rainfall quantiles decreased at average gradients of 0 046 0 091 and 0 162 mm per metre of altitude for the 2 10 and 100 year quantiles respectively the corresponding explained variance r2 for the regressions with the rainfall quantiles increased marginally from lower to higher quantiles with approximately 21 25 and 27 for 2 10 and 100 year quantiles respectively the three stations along the western coast and in the forest zone mentioned above are characterised by the lowest latitudes fig 7 and altitudes fig 8 a combination of which produced the largest uncertainties especially in the estimation of the rainfall quantiles fig 8d f 4 3 temporal trends of model parameters and daily rainfall quantiles 4 3 1 at site trend analysis at site mann kendall trend test results for the observed annual maxima am the modelled am the yearly number of wet days and the weibull distribution parameters scale and shape are reported in fig 9 the modelled am series are obtained at each station by using the yearly estimated 2 year return level i e the theoretical median of the annual maxima the observed and modelled am exhibit both increasing and decreasing temporal trends with a quite similar spatial distribution and a fraction of significant trends lower than the 0 05 α level as such these significant trends could just represent stochastic noise comparing fig 9d and e we can state that the model qualitatively well reproduces the observations the number of wet days fig 9c shows a percentage of significant trends higher than 5 18 8 increasing 10 4 decreasing and some spatial patterns more stations with increasing trends are in the southern part of ghana between the coastal and forest zones and in the northern and central eastern part savannah and eastern transition zone while decreasing trends are mostly located in a central area between forest and transition the scale parameter exhibits an 8 3 of stations with a significant decreasing trend and a few stations with a significant increasing trend looking at the spatial distribution fig 9a most of the decreasing trends are located in the southern in the northern and in the central eastern parts of ghana while increasing trends are mainly located in the central western area this zoning is similar to the one observed for the yearly number of wet days the shape parameter fig 9b only shows decreasing significant trends 8 3 of stations the spatial distribution of the trends in the shape parameter is similar to the zoning emerging from what is observed for both the scale and the number of wet days 4 3 2 regional trend analysis based on altitudinal regions the fact that similar spatial patterns are observed for the trends of the different model parameters and that these patterns do not follow the latitudinal hydro climatic regions nor the two rainfall pattern zones fig s1 suggests that changes in the hydrometeorological features leading to extremes might be driven by different factors from the elevation map of ghana fig 1 we note that the southern northern and central eastern parts are characterized by lower altitudes while the central western area is dominated by elevations exceeding 200 m a s l by combining these altitudinal features with the observed patterns in the trends fig 9 we organized the stations in three new regions in order to better examine the possible temporal trends in a regional framework i the coastal basins the low elevation part south of the hills ii the hilly region the central part with elevation higher than 200 m a s l iii the volta basins the region to the north of the hills for the most part below 200 m a s l and corresponding to the catchment area of the volta lake this demarcation is reported in dash black lines in fig 1 altitudinal regions and in fig 9 trend direction patterns the regional trend slopes are estimated on the variables normalized according to their median value and are reported in units of percent per year fig 10 ghana as a whole fig 10 a has non homogeneous trends in the distribution parameters but homogeneous increasing quantiles no significant regional trend emerges for the region as a whole homogeneity is better verified for the three regions where only the number of wet days has no homogeneous trend in two zones this implies that the daily precipitation intensity distribution is changing homogeneously in the regions indicating a possible local impact on the way daily precipitation amounts change conversely the non homogeneity of the change in the number of wet days indicates that changes in this variable is likely dominated by other factors the distribution parameters and the estimated quantiles exhibit homogeneity in the trends for all the regions this allows us to make some careful considerations about the regional trend test results in the coastal basins and the volta basin regions fig 10b and d respectively both the parameters show decreasing temporal trends with increasing trends in the quantiles the trend slopes for the estimated quantiles are in the range 0 15 0 19 and 0 25 0 44 per year for the coastal basins and the volta basin regions respectively also the annual maxima have a trend slope of about 0 14 per year for the coastal basin region the regional trends are significant at the 0 05 α level in the volta basin region for the scale and shape parameters as well as all the rainfall quantiles with weak increasing trend for the annual maxima the hilly region fig 10c has almost opposite trends in comparison to the other two regions both model parameters show increasing significant trends with non significant decreasing trends for the rainfall quantiles we notice here a discordant behaviour between the trends in the quantiles and the annual maxima which is increasing but not significant 5 discussion 5 1 performance of the statistical formulation and implications for deriving rainfall quantiles in other tropical regions the köppen geiger climate classification peel et al 2007 demarcates the entire african continent into three distinctive climates arid 57 2 northern africa parts of east and south africa tropical 31 west central and part of east africa and temperate 11 8 south africa and part of east africa the climate of our study region is predominantly tropical insert of fig 1 similar to the climate stretching from the atlantic ocean in west africa through central africa to east africa long term changes in ssa rainfall have been shown to follow the same spatial patterns as the köppen geiger climate classification especially for the tropical region harrison et al 2019 moreover the tropical west africa sub region is characterised by lack of adequate in situ observations with highly indistinguishable rainfall climatology and interannual variability among observational datasets quagraine et al 2020 generally in our study the uncertainties increased with decreasing record years of data for the bootstrap method as well as increasing return levels of extreme rainfall quantiles these increases in uncertainties were however found to be larger for the extreme value approach compared to our statistical approach fig 4 our approach proved able to quantify extreme rainfall return levels with largely reduced uncertainty with respect to traditional extreme value methods about 7 17 to quantify 100 year rainfall quantile using 10 years of record data in at site application compared to 11 62 of the gev approach fig 4 this comes as a result of the strength of the smev formulation that uses a very large number of data points for estimating the model parameters 15 40 of the yearly wet days which in the region is about 20 times larger than the number of annual maxima similar results have been reported by zorzetto et al 2016 who recorded an average mev error of the order of 50 60 the average gev estimation error when used to obtain estimates for return periods exceeding the length of the sample used to fit the distribution large uncertainties have been reported for the shape parameter of the gev approach in the west africa sub region panthou et al 2012 this parameter is very important because of its high sensitivity and the important role it plays in estimating extreme return levels clearly the quantitative accuracy of our estimates depends on the validity of our assumption concerning the stretched exponential tail of the ordinary events distribution in this study we adopted a specific test to assess whether the assumption was correct and found the stretched exponential tail model to be appropriate throughout the region compared to other regions the left censoring thresholds we found appropriate to identify the tail of the ordinary events distribution 60th 85th percentiles is rather low slightly lower than the ones found for mediterranean and semiarid arid climates in the eastern mediterranean 75th percentiles marra et al 2019 2020 and significantly lower than the ones found for continental climates 90th percentile miniussi and marra 2021 this confirms previous indications that convective like precipitation might be better described by a stretched exponential tail while stratiform like precipitation might be associated with heavier tails e g berg et al 2013 although this hypothesis deserves further research efforts our study demonstrates the implications of our approach to model and quantify extreme rainfall quantiles in data sparse tropical regions with reduced uncertainties in particular this is important when extreme value models are linked to flood generating processes for future projection of flood risk in these regions e g tramblay et al 2014 5 2 dependence of the model parameters and daily rainfall quantiles on latitudes and elevation the analysis revealed that the tail model parameters scale and shape the number of yearly wet days as well as the extreme rainfall quantiles fig 7 follow a well established latitudinal organization and hence significantly depend on latitude coincidentally the four hydro climatic regions adopted in the area savannah transition forest and coastal are well layered latitudinally and thus well represent these spatial variations whereas the parameters of the daily intensity distribution tail scale and shape parameters both increase with latitude the number of wet days and the extreme rainfall quantiles decrease with increasing latitudes in response to the decreased tail heaviness increasing shape parameter empirical observation of the relationship between the scale and shape parameters shows a log linear model fig s2 similar to what was reported by marra et al 2021a for mediterranean and arid climates higher correlations between the parameters were however observed for the savannah and transition zones compared to the forest and coastal zones fig s2a and for the volta basin and the hilly regions compared to the coastal basins fig s2b this phenomenon can be attributed to the latitudinal extents of the regions of interest fig 7 this latitudinally well organized spatial variation was however not observed by panthou et al 2012 especially for the parameters of the daily rainfall distribution these authors reported a pattern for the relationship between daily intensity distribution and latitude for the west africa sub region but were characterized by significant estimation uncertainties this can be ascribed to the spatial extent of their study area ranging between latitudes 10on and 15on and longitude 10ow and 5ow compared to the extent of our study area latitudes 4 5on and 11on and longitude 3ow and 1ow clearly our study region covered a large latitudinal extent compared to that of panthou et al 2012 and vice versa in relation to longitudinal extent in addition to this however the estimation uncertainties characterizing the adopted methods clearly played a significant role this latitudinal gradient supports the latitudinally organized köppen geiger climate classification for the subregion peel et al 2007 spatial patterns of extreme rainfall quantiles fig 6 are similar to that reported by panthou et al 2012 and the modelled summer monsoon monthly rainfall characteristics quagraine et al 2020 which decrease latitudinally from the coast to the sahel region in west africa stations along the coast and the volta river generally recorded high rainfall qualities which can be attributed to the influence of moisture fluxes from the river bodies significant dependence with the elevation emerges only for the shape parameters which drives the dependence for the estimated quantiles fig 8 similar to the spatial pattern with latitudes the shape parameter increases with elevation whereas the extreme rainfall quantiles decrease with increasing elevation fig 8e f this is interesting because intuitively we expect orographic enhancement to increase rainfall as a function of elevation e g avanzi et al 2015 marra et al 2021a however mean daily rainfall amounts do not show any significant relationship with elevation it is also worth noting that low elevation regions 200 m a s l are characterised by relatively high and variable mean daily rainfall amounts 9 9 19 8 mm compared to high elevation regions 10 2 14 1 mm clearly the well organized relationship between the shape parameters and elevation fig 8b has a larger impact on estimating high rainfall return levels e g panthou et al 2012 altitude however has been shown to mostly affect the temporal trends of the parameter rather than their value as discussed in the next section 5 3 temporal trends of the model parameters and rainfall quantiles many recent studies used a regional scale approach to investigate the field significance and the consistency of changes within a region and to detect if the local changes could indicate or not the impact of global phenomena like climate change e g renard et al 2008 yue and wang 2002 blanchet et al 2018 the regional temporal trend analysis revealed regions in which the changes in the distribution parameters and in the estimated quantiles are homogeneous and highlighted their statistical significance we found rather homogeneous increasing trends in the estimated quantiles throughout the study region although not statistically significant fig 10a these results seem to derive from non homogeneous trends in the distribution parameters the unverified homogeneity suggests the rainfall distribution changes differently within ghana and that a regional trend test based on the whole region could be misleading these findings agree with a previous study by manzanas et al 2014 they found that the annual precipitation from the rain gauge dataset exhibits no significant trend during the period 1986 2010 but with the same direction increasing among the regions contrasting results were found for trends in the annual maximum daily precipitation which showed high zonal variability by observing the presence of spatial patterns in the at site trend results and after realizing that altitude represented a good proxy for these patterns fig 9 the regional trend test was applied to the three new regions as described in section 4 3 2 the role of altitude in the rainfall changes emerged in a previous study owusu and waylen 2009 where the kwahu plateau corresponding to the higher part of the hills area demarcated in our study was found to be a divide in the extend of changes in the mean value of annual totals by comparing two periods 1951 1970 and 1981 2000 a greater reduction was found in those stations located south west to the plateau increasing trend of post 1980 annual maximum peak discharge in west africa has been attributed to intense precipitation as a result of increased thunderstorm activity associated with enhanced convective available vertical shear driven by cooling temperature trends over western africa tramblay et al 2020 with the exception of the average number of wet days which is a variable largely dependent on large scale meteorological features and characterized by large spatial correlation for two out of the three regions all the variables show homogeneous trends within each region supporting the chosen area demarcation and giving the chance to make consistent considerations on the trend test results and to explain trends in quantiles by the trends in the parameters in the coastal and volta basins which show similar direction for the trends but they are significant only for the volta basin the trends in the parameters act a synergically on the rainfall intensity distribution decreasing scale lowers the intensities among all the probabilities decreasing shape enhances the distribution tail heaviness but the heavier tail has greater effect than the decreasing scale on the estimated quantiles and this is more evident for the volta basins area the significant increasing trend in the tail heaviness results in significant increasing trends in the quantiles with slopes magnified for the rarer return levels this suggests that in the studied time period the area was characterised by changes in the features of the rainfall distribution at the daily time scale with extreme daily rainfall amounts becoming more severe also in the hilly region the trends in the parameters act a synergically on the rainfall intensity distribution but in the opposite direction with respect to the previous two regions and here the lighter tail of the distribution significant increasing shape results in decreasing quantiles the study of the temporal trend at the regional scale suggests that the direction of the temporal changes in the extreme rainfall intensities differs between regions increasing in the coastal basins region decreasing in the hilly region and significantly increasing in the volta basin region observed am show non significant positive trends for all the regions and the modelled am trends are generally in the same direction it can be noticed that the trend for the modelled am for the volta basin region is significant and higher than the observed one suggesting here a positive trend could exist but could be masked by stochastic uncertainties the regional trend analysis revealed that changes are more relevant when altitudinal regions are considered rather than the classic climatic zones these findings are important for quantification and management of hydro climatic risk in the region 6 conclusions we explored the use of statistical methods based on a large number of ordinary events which are assumed to correspond to all the wet day amounts as opposed to extremes only to improve precipitation frequency analyses in data scarce tropical regions in ssa the statistical method was applied to a relatively vast rain gauge data archive covering diverse hydro climatic regions across ghana the main findings of our study can be summarized as follows the two parameter stretched exponential weibull distribution well approximates the tail of the daily rainfall distribution throughout the area the largest 15 40 of the yearly wet days are found to belong to such tails and used for estimating the model parameters the statistical approach was able to quantify extreme return periods exceeding the length of the sample used to fit the distribution with largely reduced uncertainties compared to the extreme value based methods the tail model parameters scale and shape the number of yearly wet days and the extreme rainfall quantiles follow a well established and statistically significant latitudinal organization and hence are well described by the four latitudinally layered hydro climatic regions typically adopted in the area altitude significantly affects the tail heaviness of the daily intensity distribution and thus extreme rainfall quantiles but has no statistically significant impact on the other model parameters temporal changes during the period 1978 2018 were found to be non homogeneous within the area as well as within the four hydro climatic regions but three homogeneous regions were demarcated based on altitude regional trend tests showed contrasting trends in extreme return levels in low elevation 200 m a s l and hilly regions related to contrasting changes in the daily intensity distribution parameters significantly increasing trends in extreme daily rainfall amounts are observed in the low elevation volta basin this study represents an important step towards the modelling and quantification of the return levels of rainfall extremes in tropical regions typically characterised by lack of adequate long records of in situ observations the adopted statistical approach can be extended to the use of global or regional reanalyses and or climate models which will permit modelling of changing climatic conditions in other regions with less ground observations among the practical results the observed increasing trends in extreme daily rainfall amounts in the volta basin during 1978 2018 call for further investigation and quantification of changes in future

3202,this work summarizes lessons learnt on using satellite precipitation products spps for flood simulation and prediction and proposes ways forward in this field of research a meta analysis was carried out to review effect of climate zone topographical features selection of hydrological models and calibration procedures on spps forced hydrological model performance spps performance was shown

hydrologic prediction satellite precipitation product 1 introduction flood is one of the most catastrophic natural disasters causing substantial economic and social devastation worldwide bich et al 2011 flood has affected more than 2 billion people between 1998 and 2017 eckstein et al 2018 the recent increase of extreme weather events ewes associated with climate change can aggravate the frequency and magnitude of floods across the globe ipcc 2001 in a recent study carried out in china luo et al 2019 an increasing trend of ewes from 1960 to 2010 across south east and north west china was reported similarly a study in the united states janssen et al 2014 found a rising trend of ewes from 1901 to 2012 similar observations were reported by various studies in many parts of the world hinge et al 2021a kron et al 2019 ray et al 2021 also prediction studies carried out with the help of global circulation models suggested a likely increase in the frequency of ewes particularly under high greenhouse gases emission scenarios myhre et al 2019 singh et al 2019 this highlights the need for a better flood prediction system for risk management and preparedness using flood mitigation measures hydrological modelling is one of the main tools for flood forecasting and early warning qi et al 2019 however hydrologic models often underestimate extreme events when compared to actual observations asadieh and krakauer 2015 precipitation data as a forcing variable has a crucial influence on the performance of the hydrological model ma et al 2021 rain gauge data are considered the best precipitation data source for hydrological modelling amorim et al 2020 however the use of rain gauge data is limited by several factors particularly poor network density and limited spatial and temporal resolution in certain areas kidd et al 2017 this underlines the need for alternative accurate and real time precipitation data to obtain reliable predictions of extreme events one of the plausible ways to tackle this issue was suggested by barrett and martin 1981 that is with the help of satellite precipitation products spps spps provide near global rainfall data at high spatial and temporal resolutions mahmoud et al 2021a b tang et al 2016a spps data have been applied to numerous hydrological models to simulate and predict floods behrangi et al 2011 jiang et al 2012 li et al 2015 yong et al 2010 although these studies revealed the potential of spps for flood prediction they also reported underlying uncertainties in the use of spps zubieta et al 2017 also most of the past studies have limited their evaluation of the performance of spps by forcing single multiple spps into the hydrologic model then comparing and validating them with the observed streamflow flood data yong et al 2010 few articles have reviewed the performance of spp in flood prediction and modelling for instance maggioni and massari 2018 provides a comprehensive review on the performance of spp for river flood modelling on a regional basis also the study by serrat capdevila et al 2014 reviewed the role of spp for various hydrological applications although these review articles indicated the influence of climate types on the performance of spp however the performance of spp under different types of climate zones was not comprehensively analyse also though the performance of various spp types was discussed a comprehensive comparison of the performance of spp with merged algorithm such as imerg product with respect to other popular spp types that work on either infrared or microwave algorithm was not carried out similarly the impact of interaction between hydrological modelling and spp basin characteristics was not explored in view of this a meta data analysis was conducted to seek answers to the following research questions q1 which spp was most commonly used in recent years and what is its relative performance in comparison to other spps in the context of flood simulation and prediction q2 how does the performance of flood simulation and prediction using spps vary when applied under different climatic zones q3 is model re calibration a viable option to improve the performance of spp forced streamflow simulation prediction q4 in addition to individual uncertainties caused by spp and hydrological models does interaction between different spp and hydrological models also contribute to streamflow simulations prediction uncertainties q5 what is the influence of basin characteristics on the performance of spp forced streamflow simulations predictions it is envisioned that the analysis will also help outline lessons learned and the way forward in using spps for flood simulation and predictions 2 satellite precipitation products an overview in the past few years spps have been developed and made available in major parts of the globe and have the potential to be available on a global scale lin and wang 2011 mohammed et al 2020 tapiador et al 2017 methods that are used to derive precipitation from satellites can be broadly classified into three types 1 visible infrared vis ir 2 passive and active microwave pmw and 3 merged pmw and vis ir approach kidd et al 2017 the science behind the vis ir is that the bright and cold clouds in visible and infrared regions are linked to convection adler and negri 1988 based on this concept bright images and the cloud top temperature from the vis ir band are retrieved arkin and meisner 1987 a simple relation between derived data from vis ir and surface precipitation is then developed and the precipitation is estimated adler and negri 1988 however this relationship is more complex than it was initially thought to be arkin and meisner 1987 thus fusing techniques like artificial neural networks ann and others machine learning methods were used to derive multi source information from satellites and improve the relationship between surface precipitation and vis ir observation ashouri et al 2015 one such example is the precipitation estimation from remote sensed information using ann persiann ashouri et al 2015 apart from persiann many others vis ir based spps are available among the other prevalent spps that used vis ir is the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations chirps funk et al 2015 pmw is a more direct way of measuring precipitation from satellite as pmw is sensitive to precipitation particle size elsaesser and kummerow 2015 another advantage of pmw is because it can penetrate even through clouds stephens et al 2002 pmw retrieval methods can be empirical physical based semi empirical probabilistic and neural networks aires et al 2001 prigent et al 2016 some spps combined both ir and pmw algorithms thus allowing them to take advantage of the strength of ir and pmw an example is the climate prediction center morphing technique cmorph joyce et al 2004 which uses ir information to measure the cloud movement and morphs this information to pmw observations between successive satellite overpasses another example is the recently released integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg huffman et al 2015 which merges precipitation estimates from pmw and ir sensors along with surface precipitation measurements to improve the rainfall estimation trmm 3b42 is another merged product that uses the infrequent rain estimates to calibrate ir rain rates which has better temporal sampling in order to generate a daily product a summary of various spps reviewed in the present study is shown in table 1 2 1 bias and uncertainties of spps precipitation estimates from the satellite are associated with bias and uncertainties maggioni and massari 2018 these biases need to be quantified and corrected for appropriate application of spp in flood prediction the error and uncertainties of spps are quantified by comparing the spps against the reference data i e against the rain gauge or radar data or model output the bias and uncertainties associated with spps could be categorized into observation errors sampling errors and errors due to retrieval algorithms maggioni and massari 2018 detection errors include missed rain when the satellite failed to detect rain but there is rain on the ground or false alarm where the satellite record is more than zero but there is no rain on the ground sampling error are associated with lack of continuous precipitation record satellites are not observing the earth continuously in time and space hence depending upon the revisit time and frequency of data acquisition the rainfall estimates may be subjected to sampling errors also each retrieval scheme has its own assumptions leading to biases and noise in the spp data for instance retrieval schemes based on visible information suffer from not being able to retrieve any data during night time the article by maggioni et al 2022 provides a detailed explanation of the error and uncertainties associated with spps 3 hydrological models for flood application an overview a variety of hydrological models have been successfully applied for flood forecasting and simulation belabid et al 2019 dutta et al 2021 they may be classified according to different criteria hydrological models for flood forecasting simulation may be classified as stochastic or deterministic models depending on the catchment process or as distributed and lumped models depending on how the catchment is discretized organization 2011 fig 1 deterministic models solve a set of equations representing the watershed process to produce a single output e g runoff from a set of parameters in contrast stochastic models can take care of the random nature of input data that determines the river flows organization 2011 hydrological models require numerous observations as well as model parameter optimization arnold et al 2012 the scarcity of data will restrict the model s performance error due to inadequate parameter optimization also limits the model performance goyal et al 2018 therefore hydrological models need to be calibrated to reduce the errors due to the inadequate parameter value goyal et al 2018 in model calibration the parameters of a hydrological model are estimated from historical input output records during the calibration process accuracy criteria are used to evaluate to performance of the calibration process arnold et al 2012 the review work of jain et al 2018 provides a detailed explanation of the various hydrological models used for flood forecasting 4 review materials and methods 4 1 methodology for selection and screening of articles in order to find relevant literature on the use of spps for flood simulation and predictions the search followed a structured method for screening and selecting manuscripts fig 2 below is an outline of the process step 1 search expressions relevant search expressions as shown in fig 2 were used for selection of articles step 2 initial screening all peer reviewed journal articles accessible through the web of science wos and scopus database and that include satellite based precipitation products for flood monitoring simulation and prediction and published in english were targeted for this study the year of the publications was limited to 1980 2021 step 3 final screening only articles that used spp for flood simulation and prediction were considered irrelevant articles were excluded fig 2 step 4 final shortlist in the final step essential information like the type of spp use the geography of the location topography climate type basin size the hydrological model used etc was extracted studies conducted on a larger geographical area e g covering different basins and climate types were double counted in each area making the total number of studies surpassing the actual number of articles reviewed for different spps finally a database was created using the extracted data from these selected articles the database included essential basic metrics to allow for an overall initial evaluation of the performance of spps in flood simulation and prediction 4 2 metrics used to evaluate spps for flood simulation and predictions the present study aims to evaluate the influence of spp type hydrological models and spp interaction calibration process and basin characteristics on the performance of the spp forced hydrological model for flood simulation and prediction the pearson correlation coefficient pcc and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse reported by the literature were used as metrics to evaluate the performance of spps these metrics are expressed as follows 1 p c c x i x y i y x i x 2 y i y 2 2 n s e 1 x i y i 2 x i y 2 where x refers to the estimated flood discharge value obtained by forcing spps into the hydrological model x refers to the mean value of x variable y refers to the observed flood discharge values and y refers to the mean value of the y variable respectively the larger the value of pcc and nse indicates the higher estimate reliability as shown in table 2 4 2 1 performance comparison of commonly used spps first the geographic distribution of the published articles across different countries over the search period was extracted then the information on the number of studies that compared different spps was extracted and compiled in an excel spreadsheet these information were used to compare the performance of different spps in flood simulation and prediction 4 2 1 1 performance of spps across various climatic zones the present study used the koppen climate classification rubel and kottek 2010 to evaluate the suitability of various spps in monitoring and predicting floods across the different climatic zones koppen climate classification consists of five major groups and multiple subtypes within each main group this study focuses only on the main five major groups tropical dry temperate continental and polar to evaluate spp s performance the koppen climate type of the study location is directly extracted from the paper if mentioned otherwise the latitude and longitude of the study location are overlayed on the shapefile of the world koppen climate map in arcgis to obtain the climate class type of the study location pcc and nse were used as metrics to evaluate the quality of spp 4 2 1 2 impact of model calibration procedure many articles bitew and gebremichael 2011 stisen and sandholt 2010 wang et al 2020 attempted to calibrate the hydrological model using two calibration scenarios in scenario 1 the hydrological model parameters are initially calibrated with the historical rain gauge data and then the calibrated model is re run with spp estimates in scenario 2 the parameters of the hydrological model were recalibrated with the spp data itself the present study extracted and evaluated the results reported from these studies to evaluate the impact of calibration procedures on the performance of the spp the results collected are presented in the form of a boxplot a paired t test was used to determine if there is a significant difference between the two calibration scenarios of each spp for the t test the significance level α was taken as 0 05 4 2 1 3 interaction between different spp and hydrological models the authors hypothesized that the combination of different spps and hydrological models could affect the spp performance in predicting and simulating flood data thus based on the literature review the present study attempted to evaluate the interaction between types of spp and hydrological models the present study extracted the following information from the literature a what is the best spp representing the ground precipitation data b what are the different types of hydrological models used c discharge simulations prediction results using different hydrological models and precipitation products this information is used to evaluate whether the best spp data always guarantee better discharge simulation and prediction or that the prediction also depends on the applied model and its interaction with spp 4 2 1 4 semi distributed vs fully distributed hydrological model using spps based on the literature review the present study attempted to evaluate the influence of the type of hydrological model on the performance of spp forced streamflow simulation and prediction to do so the data were grouped depending upon the type of hydrological model used irrespective of the type of spp an example of semi distributed model is swat soil water assessment tool and gssha gridded surface subsurface hydrologic analysis is an example of distributed hydrological model lumped and stochastic models were not compared due to a lack of sufficient data the full list of the classification of the type of hydrological models is shown in table a1 4 2 1 5 influence of basin characteristics based on the literature review the present study attempted to evaluate the influence of catchment characteristics particularly catchment area and topography on the performance of spp forced streamflow simulations predictions to do so the pearson correlation coefficient reported from various studies carried out across basins of varying topography and size was plotted and evaluated against basin size and mean elevation 5 results 5 1 selection of articles using the search expressions that were broadly defined to detect all relevant articles a total of 1392 articles were found 791 from web of science wos and 601 from scopus databases further screening by skimming the abstracts of the articles helped remove irrelevant and duplicated articles in total 70 articles were found to meet the required criteria and therefore used for further analysis the list of all the compiled articles and their details including their significant findings is presented in tabular format in appendix a table a1 5 2 performance of spp forced hydrological modelling hydrological modelling using spps as forcing input has been tested globally as shown in table a1 in the appendix it was found that the performance of various hydrological models using spps is not always adequate especially in complex terrain yong et al 2010 another interesting finding was that the locally calibrated spps like cpc fews which was specially produced for the african continent and aphrodite specially created for the asian continent performed better than global spps qi et al 2018 stisen and sandholt 2010 this is due to the use of regional precipitation dataset to train and calibrate the satellite precipitation algorithm also model performance improved when the original uncorrected spps were replaced by bias corrected spps table a1 the subsections below further detail the influence of various factors on the performance of spps to guide future applications of spps in flood simulation and prediction 5 2 1 overall comparison spps performance fig 3 compares the frequency of usage of various spps for flood simulation and prediction across the globe although the trmm stopped functioning in december 2019 it was found that it is one of the most applied and tested spp fig 3 more than 50 articles used trmm in the context of flood studies this was followed by cmorph and persiann which were used by more than 17 articles the application of the imerg products for flood simulation has also gained much attention since its first version was released in 2015 fig 3 also includes the number of studies that compared different spps and the number of articles in which a particular spp was found to perform better than others in the context of flood simulation and prediction the comparison was based on the nse and r2 metrics reported by the articles as seen from fig 3 altogether 47 comparative studies used trmm to compare its performance with others spps out of these 47 trmm performed better than the other spps in 28 studies 59 57 as the spp which was built upon the success of trmm imerg was found to perform better than trmm out of the 11 comparative studies that used imerg products it was found that imerg performed better than other spps in ten studies 90 91 in many studies imerg outperformed the trmm product indicating a promising hydrologic utility of the gpm imerg the imerg product was updated several times from original version 3 to version 6 leading to continuous improvement in its performance the performance of other spps can be seen in fig 3 5 2 2 performance of spps across various climatic zones in general spps are more suitable for estimating tropical and temperate convection rainfall patterns than the isolated convection rainfall in dry arid semi arid regions bouaziz et al 2021 this is also evident in fig 4 which shows that the performance of spps in flood prediction and monitoring is higher in temperate and tropical climates than in dry climate these results agree with the findings of some studies that explore the performance of spps over catchments located in various climatic zones jiang and bauer gottwein 2019 najmaddin et al 2017 however as the performance of spps may be influenced by other factors more studies should be designed to block other factors e g type of spp and hydrological model to be able to elucidate the impact of the climatic zone on the performance of spps 5 2 3 impact of model calibration procedure the present study classified the data to each spp to highlight the effect of the two model calibration scenarios regardless of the used spp this was done only for those studies that attempted to calibrate the hydrological model using two calibration scenarios as mentioned in section 4 2 3 the result of the finding indicates the impact of the calibration procedure on the performance of the hydrological models fig 5 it was found that the hydrological model performance significantly increases p 0 05 when using the spp for model calibration scenario 2 compared to when the model is manually calibrated with historical gauge data and rerunning the model with spp estimates scenario 1 though the result was found to be insignificant in the case of persiann nonetheless scenario 2 was found to be better than scenario 1 for all other spps this difference in model performance between the two scenarios may be attributed to the difference in the value of satellite precipitation data with respect to the precipitation gauge data stisen and sandholt 2010 past studies have shown that even rain gauge data are not free of error and contain uncertainties similar to spp data ali et al 2005 anagnostou et al 2010 hence such a difference may also be due to the poor quality lack of spatial coverage and missing data particularly for regions with sparse rain gauges thus recalibrating the model with a specific input can also overcome the limitation of shortage in gauge data poor coverage model inadequacies and other unknown errors ali et al 2005 5 2 4 impact of interaction between different spps and hydrological models the model structure model parameters and the forcing data are the three essential sources shaping a hydrological model s performance wang et al 2021 as seen in the previous section precipitation data error can cause considerable uncertainties in flood simulation and prediction regarding the hydrological model structure previous studies have also tested various models for flood simulation and prediction refer table a1 these studies provide valuable information about the applicability and suitability of spp forced hydrological modelling however data in table a1 also indicate that the majority of the studies often used a single hydrological model to evaluate the performance of spps so far very few studies have paid attention to the interaction between the use of different spps with different hydrological models from these few studies it is clear that model choice greatly influences the performance of spps table 3 for instance zhang et al 2019 showed that the vic hydrological model outperformed the xaj model when forced with trmm and gpm imerg data an interesting finding by wang et al 2021 indicates that cmorph performed better when combined with the vic model whereas trmm performed better when forced with the swat model similarly qi et al 2015 reported that aphrodite agrees well with topmodel whereas gldas agrees well with web dhm these findings indicate that good discharge simulation depends upon the interaction between the hydrological model and the type of spp these few studies indicate the need to emphasize the interaction between the different types of spps and the used hydrological model to improve the flood prediction and simulation results 5 2 5 semi distributed vs fully distributed hydrological models using spps the present study classified the data into the semi distributed and distributed model to highlight the effect of the applied hydrological model irrespective of the used spp fig 6 shows the nse values indicating the impact of the type of hydrological model on the performance of spp forced streamflow simulation and prediction overall it was found that the fully distributed model outperformed the semi distributed models with nse values of 0 79 for fully distributed and 0 55 for semi distributed models respectively 5 2 6 influence of basin characteristics several authors reported that the improvement of the hydrologic model is a direct function of the catchment area and that the error increases with decreasing basin area camici et al 2018 gao et al 2017 quintero et al 2016 the same was observed in fig 7 where a positive correlation can be seen between the performance of spps and the basin size albeit the r2 value shows little confidence in this finding this indicates that basin size may have an impact on propagating the error from the spp to the model output similarly mean elevation was used as an indicator of the influence of topographic features on the performance of spps fig 8 shows a negative correlation between the mean elevation and performance of spps this indicates that the spps performed better in low elevation areas with low terrain such as deltas and floodplains than high elevation mountainous areas it was important to note that though a positive correlation was found between the performance of spps and the basin size and a negative correlation between the mean elevation and performance of spps the r square value in both cases was very low and there is a lot of noise in the data set figs 7 and 8 as observed in the previous section the performance of spps may be affected by climatic conditions model selection and other factors thus more studies should be designed to block other factors to be able to elucidate the influence of the basin characteristics on the performance of spps 6 discussion a variety of spps have been applied to numerous hydrological models to simulate and predict floods jiang et al 2018 luo et al 2019 it was found that the microwave based spps performed better than infrared based spps primarily as they can penetrate into clouds and better estimate the cloud s water content hinge et al 2021b the results of this meta analysis show that trmm is one of the most applied and tested spp in flood application overall trmm imerg and cmorph have shown to perform better than other spps for flood simulation and forecasting under diverse setting meng et al 2014 zeweldi et al 2011 these spps are the ones that combines passive microwave imagery pmw and ir measurements these indicates the advantages of the algorithms that combined measurements from different sensors while trmm has stopped functioning the imerg which was built upon the success of trmm proved to be better than trmm in most cases indicating a promising hydrologic utility of gpm imerg for flood application yuan et al 2018 however despite the indication that the performance of spps like imerg cmorph trmm is superior to others in most cases the performance of the spp forced hydrological model varies significantly with the variation of factors yuan et al 2018 in some instances spp forced hydrological models performed very poorly compared to models that relied on gauge data for instance tang et al 2016 forced the crest model with imerg and trmm data and found that imerg performed better than trmm in the ganjiang river basin one of the major tributaries of the yangtze river in southern china on the other hand yuan et al 2018 forced imerg and trmm with grid based xinanjiang model and found that the daily discharge simulation with the imerg product is superior and comparable with that of the gauge based precipitation in northeast china various other similar studies reported the differences in performance of various spps in different parts of the world such differences are attributed to the heterogeneous quality of the spp the effect of climatic factors differences in calibration procedures and the differences in basin characteristics gourley et al 2011 jiang et al 2012 knoche et al 2014 the results of the meta analysis also focused on investigating the impact of spp type on its performance in flood simulation and prediction results indicated that it can lead to a significant difference in flood prediction and simulation performance across different climate zones in dry regions spps were found to perform poorly as they face estimation challenges due to the prevalence of hot background surfaces desert aerosols and sub cloud evaporation bouaziz et al 2021 the high evaporation rate of hydrometeors rain drops often leads to false alarm or overestimation of spps when compared to rain gauge data serrat capdevila et al 2014 for instance it was reported that in southern arizona regions individual storms often drift over the desert and little rain reach the ground surface this highlights the importance of spps correction in such cases to avoid overestimation serrat capdevila et al 2014 the meta analysis also focused on the impact of catchment characteristics on the performance of spp forced hydrological modelling results of the review conducted revealed that high altitude regions pose a challenge for spps due to the inability of spps to differentiate between raining and non raining clouds especially for spps with ir algorithms dinku et al 2011 even the spps with the pmw algorithm underestimates the rain in mountainous regions primarily when orographic rain is not resulting from the ice aloft dinku et al 2011 the underperformance of spp forced hydrological modelling in mountainous areas was reported by many studies as a result of complex topography over such regions gao et al 2017 musie et al 2019 the effect of basin size on the performance of spps was also noted however there are contradicting results reported in the literature for instance pan et al 2010 reported that the spps performance does not change with respect to basin size interestingly yilmaz et al 2005 pointed out that the improvement of model performance in large basins depends mainly on the bias present in the original spp data bias correction of spps was proposed as an important step before the applications of spps across various climatic conditions and complex topography behrangi et al 2011 several bias correction methods were attempted to correct the bias on spps ranging from simple scaling methods to complex mapping the appendix table a2 shown an overview of some of the commonly used bias correction schemes to improve the performance of spps the choice of bias correction scheme depends upon the user desired level of accuracy to represents the spatial and temporal characteristics of spps overall the bias corrected spps should improve the flood prediction performance by improved rainfall representation however it is also important to note that given the non stationary nature of spps bias correction may not always improve the flood prediction performance of the hydrological models maggioni and massari 2018 multi source precipitation data fusion is another latest approach proposed to reduce bias and improves the performance of spps several data fusion techniques such as weighted fusion linear regressions geographically weighted regression conditional merging triple collocation based framework probability density function optimal interpolation etc have been tested to merge spps data set in various spatial domain li et al 2022 however the results of these studies indicated regional deficiencies due to inconsistencies level of accuracy li et al 2022 thus research on data fusion of spps should be further investigated and improved by first correcting the bias of individual spp followed by fusing the corrected spps another important finding is the influence of interaction between the hydrological model and spp from this analysis it was found that better spp data alone do not guarantee better discharge simulation for instance in the study carried by wang et al 2021 the best spp was cmorph however the best spp that can represent the observed streamflow was found to vary depending on the type of hydrological models similar findings were reported by the other two studies table 3 these results can be attributed to differences in hydrological models and the interaction between hydrological models and precipitation product data among the type of hydrological models it was found that fully distributed models outperformed the semi distributed models this could be attributed to the explicit spatial and temporal representation of parameters such as land use soil type and rainfall in a fully distributed model compared to a semi distributed model baruah et al 2021 our finding is in agreement with the results of other studies for instance xu et al 2015 showed that distributed gridded model gjax outperformed the semi distributed model swat when using trmm data many other studies have also reported that the distributed models are better than semi distributed models qi et al 2015 sharif et al 2017 interestingly contradicting results were also reported in the literature where semi distributed models are comparable and sometime outperformed the distributed models for instance zhang et al 2019 found that the semi distributed vic model outperformed the fully distributed gssha model using trmm and gpm imerg these contradicting results could be because hydrological models are highly dependent on the shape and parameter characteristics of the basin al areeq et al 2021 model re calibration has proven to be one of the strategies employed by past studies to improve the performance of spp forced hydrological modelling gunathilake et al 2020 this practice is similar to the calibration of hydrological models with gauge data except that the data used for re calibration comes from a spatially explicit spp dataset stisen and sandholt 2010 7 conclusion and way forward this work reviewed the most prevalent spps and evaluated the factors that can potentially affect the performance of hydrological models in flood simulation and prediction results of the review conducted indicated that spps have their uncertainties and discrepancies along with their strengths it was found that improving the performance of hydrological simulations relies both on the type of hydrological model employed as well as on the type of the spp hence only considering and addressing the uncertainties resulting from spps does not guarantees better prediction it is important to consider various sources of uncertainties resulting from both the employed hydrological model and selected spp in future efforts to achieve better prediction performance the past studies also revealed that model re calibration is one of the viable possibilities that can improve the performance of spp spps were found to perform better in low lying lands such as deltas and floodplains than high elevation areas another viable strategy to enhance spps performance is to apply bias estimation however bias in spps can also vary by region and season all these findings indicate the need to develop a novel approach that will employ several evaluation techniques temporal event based assessment spatial assessment topographical and hydrological region based evaluation and climatological assessment of the spps to improve the model performance thus it is envisioned that future studies should focus on the following considerations a exploring the effect of climatic conditions and basin characteristics on the performance of spps in hydrological modeling should precede its use for flood modeling prediction and decision making b although model recalibration partly compensates for the error in spps bias correction such as quantile mapping and novel bias correction approach such as rain vs no rain discriminative model xiao et al 2021 etc should be implemented especially for areas with dense gauge networks c as the performance of spps over mountainous areas is a challenging task a new perspective method by considering meteorological parameters like temperature profile specific humidity profile components wind etc similar to that suggested by thakur et al 2019 should be explored and developed d future studies should focus on correcting the bias resulting from both the selected spp and the employed hydrological model to achieve better prediction performance when using spps for hydrological applications model selection is an important factor the work of godara and bruland n d gives some basic guidelines on selection of model as influenced by catchment size catchment relief and the types of rainfall in a region e research on data fusion of spps should be investigated and improved by employing bias correction to individual spp prior to fusing the spps funding this research was funded by the national water and

3202,this work summarizes lessons learnt on using satellite precipitation products spps for flood simulation and prediction and proposes ways forward in this field of research a meta analysis was carried out to review effect of climate zone topographical features selection of hydrological models and calibration procedures on spps forced hydrological model performance spps performance was shown to be higher in temperate and tropical than in dry climates low lying and moderate elevations areas exhibited high performance accuracy compared to higher latitudes landscapes spps that use microwave algorithms were found to outperform the others the best simulation and prediction results were found after bias correction and model recalibration from a general standpoint spps offer great potential for flood simulation and prediction but the performance of spps needs to be enhanced for operational purposes the present study discusses bias correction techniques model recalibration the importance of interaction between different types of spps and hydrological models and other lessons learned and future directions of using spps for future flood applications keywords flood hydrological model hydrologic prediction satellite precipitation product 1 introduction flood is one of the most catastrophic natural disasters causing substantial economic and social devastation worldwide bich et al 2011 flood has affected more than 2 billion people between 1998 and 2017 eckstein et al 2018 the recent increase of extreme weather events ewes associated with climate change can aggravate the frequency and magnitude of floods across the globe ipcc 2001 in a recent study carried out in china luo et al 2019 an increasing trend of ewes from 1960 to 2010 across south east and north west china was reported similarly a study in the united states janssen et al 2014 found a rising trend of ewes from 1901 to 2012 similar observations were reported by various studies in many parts of the world hinge et al 2021a kron et al 2019 ray et al 2021 also prediction studies carried out with the help of global circulation models suggested a likely increase in the frequency of ewes particularly under high greenhouse gases emission scenarios myhre et al 2019 singh et al 2019 this highlights the need for a better flood prediction system for risk management and preparedness using flood mitigation measures hydrological modelling is one of the main tools for flood forecasting and early warning qi et al 2019 however hydrologic models often underestimate extreme events when compared to actual observations asadieh and krakauer 2015 precipitation data as a forcing variable has a crucial influence on the performance of the hydrological model ma et al 2021 rain gauge data are considered the best precipitation data source for hydrological modelling amorim et al 2020 however the use of rain gauge data is limited by several factors particularly poor network density and limited spatial and temporal resolution in certain areas kidd et al 2017 this underlines the need for alternative accurate and real time precipitation data to obtain reliable predictions of extreme events one of the plausible ways to tackle this issue was suggested by barrett and martin 1981 that is with the help of satellite precipitation products spps spps provide near global rainfall data at high spatial and temporal resolutions mahmoud et al 2021a b tang et al 2016a spps data have been applied to numerous hydrological models to simulate and predict floods behrangi et al 2011 jiang et al 2012 li et al 2015 yong et al 2010 although these studies revealed the potential of spps for flood prediction they also reported underlying uncertainties in the use of spps zubieta et al 2017 also most of the past studies have limited their evaluation of the performance of spps by forcing single multiple spps into the hydrologic model then comparing and validating them with the observed streamflow flood data yong et al 2010 few articles have reviewed the performance of spp in flood prediction and modelling for instance maggioni and massari 2018 provides a comprehensive review on the performance of spp for river flood modelling on a regional basis also the study by serrat capdevila et al 2014 reviewed the role of spp for various hydrological applications although these review articles indicated the influence of climate types on the performance of spp however the performance of spp under different types of climate zones was not comprehensively analyse also though the performance of various spp types was discussed a comprehensive comparison of the performance of spp with merged algorithm such as imerg product with respect to other popular spp types that work on either infrared or microwave algorithm was not carried out similarly the impact of interaction between hydrological modelling and spp basin characteristics was not explored in view of this a meta data analysis was conducted to seek answers to the following research questions q1 which spp was most commonly used in recent years and what is its relative performance in comparison to other spps in the context of flood simulation and prediction q2 how does the performance of flood simulation and prediction using spps vary when applied under different climatic zones q3 is model re calibration a viable option to improve the performance of spp forced streamflow simulation prediction q4 in addition to individual uncertainties caused by spp and hydrological models does interaction between different spp and hydrological models also contribute to streamflow simulations prediction uncertainties q5 what is the influence of basin characteristics on the performance of spp forced streamflow simulations predictions it is envisioned that the analysis will also help outline lessons learned and the way forward in using spps for flood simulation and predictions 2 satellite precipitation products an overview in the past few years spps have been developed and made available in major parts of the globe and have the potential to be available on a global scale lin and wang 2011 mohammed et al 2020 tapiador et al 2017 methods that are used to derive precipitation from satellites can be broadly classified into three types 1 visible infrared vis ir 2 passive and active microwave pmw and 3 merged pmw and vis ir approach kidd et al 2017 the science behind the vis ir is that the bright and cold clouds in visible and infrared regions are linked to convection adler and negri 1988 based on this concept bright images and the cloud top temperature from the vis ir band are retrieved arkin and meisner 1987 a simple relation between derived data from vis ir and surface precipitation is then developed and the precipitation is estimated adler and negri 1988 however this relationship is more complex than it was initially thought to be arkin and meisner 1987 thus fusing techniques like artificial neural networks ann and others machine learning methods were used to derive multi source information from satellites and improve the relationship between surface precipitation and vis ir observation ashouri et al 2015 one such example is the precipitation estimation from remote sensed information using ann persiann ashouri et al 2015 apart from persiann many others vis ir based spps are available among the other prevalent spps that used vis ir is the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations chirps funk et al 2015 pmw is a more direct way of measuring precipitation from satellite as pmw is sensitive to precipitation particle size elsaesser and kummerow 2015 another advantage of pmw is because it can penetrate even through clouds stephens et al 2002 pmw retrieval methods can be empirical physical based semi empirical probabilistic and neural networks aires et al 2001 prigent et al 2016 some spps combined both ir and pmw algorithms thus allowing them to take advantage of the strength of ir and pmw an example is the climate prediction center morphing technique cmorph joyce et al 2004 which uses ir information to measure the cloud movement and morphs this information to pmw observations between successive satellite overpasses another example is the recently released integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg huffman et al 2015 which merges precipitation estimates from pmw and ir sensors along with surface precipitation measurements to improve the rainfall estimation trmm 3b42 is another merged product that uses the infrequent rain estimates to calibrate ir rain rates which has better temporal sampling in order to generate a daily product a summary of various spps reviewed in the present study is shown in table 1 2 1 bias and uncertainties of spps precipitation estimates from the satellite are associated with bias and uncertainties maggioni and massari 2018 these biases need to be quantified and corrected for appropriate application of spp in flood prediction the error and uncertainties of spps are quantified by comparing the spps against the reference data i e against the rain gauge or radar data or model output the bias and uncertainties associated with spps could be categorized into observation errors sampling errors and errors due to retrieval algorithms maggioni and massari 2018 detection errors include missed rain when the satellite failed to detect rain but there is rain on the ground or false alarm where the satellite record is more than zero but there is no rain on the ground sampling error are associated with lack of continuous precipitation record satellites are not observing the earth continuously in time and space hence depending upon the revisit time and frequency of data acquisition the rainfall estimates may be subjected to sampling errors also each retrieval scheme has its own assumptions leading to biases and noise in the spp data for instance retrieval schemes based on visible information suffer from not being able to retrieve any data during night time the article by maggioni et al 2022 provides a detailed explanation of the error and uncertainties associated with spps 3 hydrological models for flood application an overview a variety of hydrological models have been successfully applied for flood forecasting and simulation belabid et al 2019 dutta et al 2021 they may be classified according to different criteria hydrological models for flood forecasting simulation may be classified as stochastic or deterministic models depending on the catchment process or as distributed and lumped models depending on how the catchment is discretized organization 2011 fig 1 deterministic models solve a set of equations representing the watershed process to produce a single output e g runoff from a set of parameters in contrast stochastic models can take care of the random nature of input data that determines the river flows organization 2011 hydrological models require numerous observations as well as model parameter optimization arnold et al 2012 the scarcity of data will restrict the model s performance error due to inadequate parameter optimization also limits the model performance goyal et al 2018 therefore hydrological models need to be calibrated to reduce the errors due to the inadequate parameter value goyal et al 2018 in model calibration the parameters of a hydrological model are estimated from historical input output records during the calibration process accuracy criteria are used to evaluate to performance of the calibration process arnold et al 2012 the review work of jain et al 2018 provides a detailed explanation of the various hydrological models used for flood forecasting 4 review materials and methods 4 1 methodology for selection and screening of articles in order to find relevant literature on the use of spps for flood simulation and predictions the search followed a structured method for screening and selecting manuscripts fig 2 below is an outline of the process step 1 search expressions relevant search expressions as shown in fig 2 were used for selection of articles step 2 initial screening all peer reviewed journal articles accessible through the web of science wos and scopus database and that include satellite based precipitation products for flood monitoring simulation and prediction and published in english were targeted for this study the year of the publications was limited to 1980 2021 step 3 final screening only articles that used spp for flood simulation and prediction were considered irrelevant articles were excluded fig 2 step 4 final shortlist in the final step essential information like the type of spp use the geography of the location topography climate type basin size the hydrological model used etc was extracted studies conducted on a larger geographical area e g covering different basins and climate types were double counted in each area making the total number of studies surpassing the actual number of articles reviewed for different spps finally a database was created using the extracted data from these selected articles the database included essential basic metrics to allow for an overall initial evaluation of the performance of spps in flood simulation and prediction 4 2 metrics used to evaluate spps for flood simulation and predictions the present study aims to evaluate the influence of spp type hydrological models and spp interaction calibration process and basin characteristics on the performance of the spp forced hydrological model for flood simulation and prediction the pearson correlation coefficient pcc and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse reported by the literature were used as metrics to evaluate the performance of spps these metrics are expressed as follows 1 p c c x i x y i y x i x 2 y i y 2 2 n s e 1 x i y i 2 x i y 2 where x refers to the estimated flood discharge value obtained by forcing spps into the hydrological model x refers to the mean value of x variable y refers to the observed flood discharge values and y refers to the mean value of the y variable respectively the larger the value of pcc and nse indicates the higher estimate reliability as shown in table 2 4 2 1 performance comparison of commonly used spps first the geographic distribution of the published articles across different countries over the search period was extracted then the information on the number of studies that compared different spps was extracted and compiled in an excel spreadsheet these information were used to compare the performance of different spps in flood simulation and prediction 4 2 1 1 performance of spps across various climatic zones the present study used the koppen climate classification rubel and kottek 2010 to evaluate the suitability of various spps in monitoring and predicting floods across the different climatic zones koppen climate classification consists of five major groups and multiple subtypes within each main group this study focuses only on the main five major groups tropical dry temperate continental and polar to evaluate spp s performance the koppen climate type of the study location is directly extracted from the paper if mentioned otherwise the latitude and longitude of the study location are overlayed on the shapefile of the world koppen climate map in arcgis to obtain the climate class type of the study location pcc and nse were used as metrics to evaluate the quality of spp 4 2 1 2 impact of model calibration procedure many articles bitew and gebremichael 2011 stisen and sandholt 2010 wang et al 2020 attempted to calibrate the hydrological model using two calibration scenarios in scenario 1 the hydrological model parameters are initially calibrated with the historical rain gauge data and then the calibrated model is re run with spp estimates in scenario 2 the parameters of the hydrological model were recalibrated with the spp data itself the present study extracted and evaluated the results reported from these studies to evaluate the impact of calibration procedures on the performance of the spp the results collected are presented in the form of a boxplot a paired t test was used to determine if there is a significant difference between the two calibration scenarios of each spp for the t test the significance level α was taken as 0 05 4 2 1 3 interaction between different spp and hydrological models the authors hypothesized that the combination of different spps and hydrological models could affect the spp performance in predicting and simulating flood data thus based on the literature review the present study attempted to evaluate the interaction between types of spp and hydrological models the present study extracted the following information from the literature a what is the best spp representing the ground precipitation data b what are the different types of hydrological models used c discharge simulations prediction results using different hydrological models and precipitation products this information is used to evaluate whether the best spp data always guarantee better discharge simulation and prediction or that the prediction also depends on the applied model and its interaction with spp 4 2 1 4 semi distributed vs fully distributed hydrological model using spps based on the literature review the present study attempted to evaluate the influence of the type of hydrological model on the performance of spp forced streamflow simulation and prediction to do so the data were grouped depending upon the type of hydrological model used irrespective of the type of spp an example of semi distributed model is swat soil water assessment tool and gssha gridded surface subsurface hydrologic analysis is an example of distributed hydrological model lumped and stochastic models were not compared due to a lack of sufficient data the full list of the classification of the type of hydrological models is shown in table a1 4 2 1 5 influence of basin characteristics based on the literature review the present study attempted to evaluate the influence of catchment characteristics particularly catchment area and topography on the performance of spp forced streamflow simulations predictions to do so the pearson correlation coefficient reported from various studies carried out across basins of varying topography and size was plotted and evaluated against basin size and mean elevation 5 results 5 1 selection of articles using the search expressions that were broadly defined to detect all relevant articles a total of 1392 articles were found 791 from web of science wos and 601 from scopus databases further screening by skimming the abstracts of the articles helped remove irrelevant and duplicated articles in total 70 articles were found to meet the required criteria and therefore used for further analysis the list of all the compiled articles and their details including their significant findings is presented in tabular format in appendix a table a1 5 2 performance of spp forced hydrological modelling hydrological modelling using spps as forcing input has been tested globally as shown in table a1 in the appendix it was found that the performance of various hydrological models using spps is not always adequate especially in complex terrain yong et al 2010 another interesting finding was that the locally calibrated spps like cpc fews which was specially produced for the african continent and aphrodite specially created for the asian continent performed better than global spps qi et al 2018 stisen and sandholt 2010 this is due to the use of regional precipitation dataset to train and calibrate the satellite precipitation algorithm also model performance improved when the original uncorrected spps were replaced by bias corrected spps table a1 the subsections below further detail the influence of various factors on the performance of spps to guide future applications of spps in flood simulation and prediction 5 2 1 overall comparison spps performance fig 3 compares the frequency of usage of various spps for flood simulation and prediction across the globe although the trmm stopped functioning in december 2019 it was found that it is one of the most applied and tested spp fig 3 more than 50 articles used trmm in the context of flood studies this was followed by cmorph and persiann which were used by more than 17 articles the application of the imerg products for flood simulation has also gained much attention since its first version was released in 2015 fig 3 also includes the number of studies that compared different spps and the number of articles in which a particular spp was found to perform better than others in the context of flood simulation and prediction the comparison was based on the nse and r2 metrics reported by the articles as seen from fig 3 altogether 47 comparative studies used trmm to compare its performance with others spps out of these 47 trmm performed better than the other spps in 28 studies 59 57 as the spp which was built upon the success of trmm imerg was found to perform better than trmm out of the 11 comparative studies that used imerg products it was found that imerg performed better than other spps in ten studies 90 91 in many studies imerg outperformed the trmm product indicating a promising hydrologic utility of the gpm imerg the imerg product was updated several times from original version 3 to version 6 leading to continuous improvement in its performance the performance of other spps can be seen in fig 3 5 2 2 performance of spps across various climatic zones in general spps are more suitable for estimating tropical and temperate convection rainfall patterns than the isolated convection rainfall in dry arid semi arid regions bouaziz et al 2021 this is also evident in fig 4 which shows that the performance of spps in flood prediction and monitoring is higher in temperate and tropical climates than in dry climate these results agree with the findings of some studies that explore the performance of spps over catchments located in various climatic zones jiang and bauer gottwein 2019 najmaddin et al 2017 however as the performance of spps may be influenced by other factors more studies should be designed to block other factors e g type of spp and hydrological model to be able to elucidate the impact of the climatic zone on the performance of spps 5 2 3 impact of model calibration procedure the present study classified the data to each spp to highlight the effect of the two model calibration scenarios regardless of the used spp this was done only for those studies that attempted to calibrate the hydrological model using two calibration scenarios as mentioned in section 4 2 3 the result of the finding indicates the impact of the calibration procedure on the performance of the hydrological models fig 5 it was found that the hydrological model performance significantly increases p 0 05 when using the spp for model calibration scenario 2 compared to when the model is manually calibrated with historical gauge data and rerunning the model with spp estimates scenario 1 though the result was found to be insignificant in the case of persiann nonetheless scenario 2 was found to be better than scenario 1 for all other spps this difference in model performance between the two scenarios may be attributed to the difference in the value of satellite precipitation data with respect to the precipitation gauge data stisen and sandholt 2010 past studies have shown that even rain gauge data are not free of error and contain uncertainties similar to spp data ali et al 2005 anagnostou et al 2010 hence such a difference may also be due to the poor quality lack of spatial coverage and missing data particularly for regions with sparse rain gauges thus recalibrating the model with a specific input can also overcome the limitation of shortage in gauge data poor coverage model inadequacies and other unknown errors ali et al 2005 5 2 4 impact of interaction between different spps and hydrological models the model structure model parameters and the forcing data are the three essential sources shaping a hydrological model s performance wang et al 2021 as seen in the previous section precipitation data error can cause considerable uncertainties in flood simulation and prediction regarding the hydrological model structure previous studies have also tested various models for flood simulation and prediction refer table a1 these studies provide valuable information about the applicability and suitability of spp forced hydrological modelling however data in table a1 also indicate that the majority of the studies often used a single hydrological model to evaluate the performance of spps so far very few studies have paid attention to the interaction between the use of different spps with different hydrological models from these few studies it is clear that model choice greatly influences the performance of spps table 3 for instance zhang et al 2019 showed that the vic hydrological model outperformed the xaj model when forced with trmm and gpm imerg data an interesting finding by wang et al 2021 indicates that cmorph performed better when combined with the vic model whereas trmm performed better when forced with the swat model similarly qi et al 2015 reported that aphrodite agrees well with topmodel whereas gldas agrees well with web dhm these findings indicate that good discharge simulation depends upon the interaction between the hydrological model and the type of spp these few studies indicate the need to emphasize the interaction between the different types of spps and the used hydrological model to improve the flood prediction and simulation results 5 2 5 semi distributed vs fully distributed hydrological models using spps the present study classified the data into the semi distributed and distributed model to highlight the effect of the applied hydrological model irrespective of the used spp fig 6 shows the nse values indicating the impact of the type of hydrological model on the performance of spp forced streamflow simulation and prediction overall it was found that the fully distributed model outperformed the semi distributed models with nse values of 0 79 for fully distributed and 0 55 for semi distributed models respectively 5 2 6 influence of basin characteristics several authors reported that the improvement of the hydrologic model is a direct function of the catchment area and that the error increases with decreasing basin area camici et al 2018 gao et al 2017 quintero et al 2016 the same was observed in fig 7 where a positive correlation can be seen between the performance of spps and the basin size albeit the r2 value shows little confidence in this finding this indicates that basin size may have an impact on propagating the error from the spp to the model output similarly mean elevation was used as an indicator of the influence of topographic features on the performance of spps fig 8 shows a negative correlation between the mean elevation and performance of spps this indicates that the spps performed better in low elevation areas with low terrain such as deltas and floodplains than high elevation mountainous areas it was important to note that though a positive correlation was found between the performance of spps and the basin size and a negative correlation between the mean elevation and performance of spps the r square value in both cases was very low and there is a lot of noise in the data set figs 7 and 8 as observed in the previous section the performance of spps may be affected by climatic conditions model selection and other factors thus more studies should be designed to block other factors to be able to elucidate the influence of the basin characteristics on the performance of spps 6 discussion a variety of spps have been applied to numerous hydrological models to simulate and predict floods jiang et al 2018 luo et al 2019 it was found that the microwave based spps performed better than infrared based spps primarily as they can penetrate into clouds and better estimate the cloud s water content hinge et al 2021b the results of this meta analysis show that trmm is one of the most applied and tested spp in flood application overall trmm imerg and cmorph have shown to perform better than other spps for flood simulation and forecasting under diverse setting meng et al 2014 zeweldi et al 2011 these spps are the ones that combines passive microwave imagery pmw and ir measurements these indicates the advantages of the algorithms that combined measurements from different sensors while trmm has stopped functioning the imerg which was built upon the success of trmm proved to be better than trmm in most cases indicating a promising hydrologic utility of gpm imerg for flood application yuan et al 2018 however despite the indication that the performance of spps like imerg cmorph trmm is superior to others in most cases the performance of the spp forced hydrological model varies significantly with the variation of factors yuan et al 2018 in some instances spp forced hydrological models performed very poorly compared to models that relied on gauge data for instance tang et al 2016 forced the crest model with imerg and trmm data and found that imerg performed better than trmm in the ganjiang river basin one of the major tributaries of the yangtze river in southern china on the other hand yuan et al 2018 forced imerg and trmm with grid based xinanjiang model and found that the daily discharge simulation with the imerg product is superior and comparable with that of the gauge based precipitation in northeast china various other similar studies reported the differences in performance of various spps in different parts of the world such differences are attributed to the heterogeneous quality of the spp the effect of climatic factors differences in calibration procedures and the differences in basin characteristics gourley et al 2011 jiang et al 2012 knoche et al 2014 the results of the meta analysis also focused on investigating the impact of spp type on its performance in flood simulation and prediction results indicated that it can lead to a significant difference in flood prediction and simulation performance across different climate zones in dry regions spps were found to perform poorly as they face estimation challenges due to the prevalence of hot background surfaces desert aerosols and sub cloud evaporation bouaziz et al 2021 the high evaporation rate of hydrometeors rain drops often leads to false alarm or overestimation of spps when compared to rain gauge data serrat capdevila et al 2014 for instance it was reported that in southern arizona regions individual storms often drift over the desert and little rain reach the ground surface this highlights the importance of spps correction in such cases to avoid overestimation serrat capdevila et al 2014 the meta analysis also focused on the impact of catchment characteristics on the performance of spp forced hydrological modelling results of the review conducted revealed that high altitude regions pose a challenge for spps due to the inability of spps to differentiate between raining and non raining clouds especially for spps with ir algorithms dinku et al 2011 even the spps with the pmw algorithm underestimates the rain in mountainous regions primarily when orographic rain is not resulting from the ice aloft dinku et al 2011 the underperformance of spp forced hydrological modelling in mountainous areas was reported by many studies as a result of complex topography over such regions gao et al 2017 musie et al 2019 the effect of basin size on the performance of spps was also noted however there are contradicting results reported in the literature for instance pan et al 2010 reported that the spps performance does not change with respect to basin size interestingly yilmaz et al 2005 pointed out that the improvement of model performance in large basins depends mainly on the bias present in the original spp data bias correction of spps was proposed as an important step before the applications of spps across various climatic conditions and complex topography behrangi et al 2011 several bias correction methods were attempted to correct the bias on spps ranging from simple scaling methods to complex mapping the appendix table a2 shown an overview of some of the commonly used bias correction schemes to improve the performance of spps the choice of bias correction scheme depends upon the user desired level of accuracy to represents the spatial and temporal characteristics of spps overall the bias corrected spps should improve the flood prediction performance by improved rainfall representation however it is also important to note that given the non stationary nature of spps bias correction may not always improve the flood prediction performance of the hydrological models maggioni and massari 2018 multi source precipitation data fusion is another latest approach proposed to reduce bias and improves the performance of spps several data fusion techniques such as weighted fusion linear regressions geographically weighted regression conditional merging triple collocation based framework probability density function optimal interpolation etc have been tested to merge spps data set in various spatial domain li et al 2022 however the results of these studies indicated regional deficiencies due to inconsistencies level of accuracy li et al 2022 thus research on data fusion of spps should be further investigated and improved by first correcting the bias of individual spp followed by fusing the corrected spps another important finding is the influence of interaction between the hydrological model and spp from this analysis it was found that better spp data alone do not guarantee better discharge simulation for instance in the study carried by wang et al 2021 the best spp was cmorph however the best spp that can represent the observed streamflow was found to vary depending on the type of hydrological models similar findings were reported by the other two studies table 3 these results can be attributed to differences in hydrological models and the interaction between hydrological models and precipitation product data among the type of hydrological models it was found that fully distributed models outperformed the semi distributed models this could be attributed to the explicit spatial and temporal representation of parameters such as land use soil type and rainfall in a fully distributed model compared to a semi distributed model baruah et al 2021 our finding is in agreement with the results of other studies for instance xu et al 2015 showed that distributed gridded model gjax outperformed the semi distributed model swat when using trmm data many other studies have also reported that the distributed models are better than semi distributed models qi et al 2015 sharif et al 2017 interestingly contradicting results were also reported in the literature where semi distributed models are comparable and sometime outperformed the distributed models for instance zhang et al 2019 found that the semi distributed vic model outperformed the fully distributed gssha model using trmm and gpm imerg these contradicting results could be because hydrological models are highly dependent on the shape and parameter characteristics of the basin al areeq et al 2021 model re calibration has proven to be one of the strategies employed by past studies to improve the performance of spp forced hydrological modelling gunathilake et al 2020 this practice is similar to the calibration of hydrological models with gauge data except that the data used for re calibration comes from a spatially explicit spp dataset stisen and sandholt 2010 7 conclusion and way forward this work reviewed the most prevalent spps and evaluated the factors that can potentially affect the performance of hydrological models in flood simulation and prediction results of the review conducted indicated that spps have their uncertainties and discrepancies along with their strengths it was found that improving the performance of hydrological simulations relies both on the type of hydrological model employed as well as on the type of the spp hence only considering and addressing the uncertainties resulting from spps does not guarantees better prediction it is important to consider various sources of uncertainties resulting from both the employed hydrological model and selected spp in future efforts to achieve better prediction performance the past studies also revealed that model re calibration is one of the viable possibilities that can improve the performance of spp spps were found to perform better in low lying lands such as deltas and floodplains than high elevation areas another viable strategy to enhance spps performance is to apply bias estimation however bias in spps can also vary by region and season all these findings indicate the need to develop a novel approach that will employ several evaluation techniques temporal event based assessment spatial assessment topographical and hydrological region based evaluation and climatological assessment of the spps to improve the model performance thus it is envisioned that future studies should focus on the following considerations a exploring the effect of climatic conditions and basin characteristics on the performance of spps in hydrological modeling should precede its use for flood modeling prediction and decision making b although model recalibration partly compensates for the error in spps bias correction such as quantile mapping and novel bias correction approach such as rain vs no rain discriminative model xiao et al 2021 etc should be implemented especially for areas with dense gauge networks c as the performance of spps over mountainous areas is a challenging task a new perspective method by considering meteorological parameters like temperature profile specific humidity profile components wind etc similar to that suggested by thakur et al 2019 should be explored and developed d future studies should focus on correcting the bias resulting from both the selected spp and the employed hydrological model to achieve better prediction performance when using spps for hydrological applications model selection is an important factor the work of godara and bruland n d gives some basic guidelines on selection of model as influenced by catchment size catchment relief and the types of rainfall in a region e research on data fusion of spps should be investigated and improved by employing bias correction to individual spp prior to fusing the spps funding this research was funded by the national water and

jonkman 2005 death tolls from flooding have risen in many parts of the world between 1994 and 2013 244 000 people were killed by floods in the same period 2 5 billion people were affected by flood disasters unisdr cred 2015 flood is a phenomenon that occurs at different intervals with various intensities the flood event as a probabilistic phenomenon needs to be predicted wan mohtar et al 2020 precise prediction can have a significant effect on reducing damages grothmann reusswig 2006 however flooding is a complex phenomenon controlled by many physical factors and therefore its prediction remains challenging kalantari et al 2014 population increase and the rapid growth of urban development and deforestation have increased the risk of flooding in many areas in iran ahmadisharaf et al 2016 3 700 floods have been reported in the last 60 years in iran while the damage caused by floods has increased by 250 in the last decade arabameri et al 2019 using five high resolution climatic models in the watershed department of iran wdi hydrologists have concluded that from 2025 to 2049 compared to 1980 2004 iran is more likely to have long dry periods with experience of heavy rainfall between them which is a sign of increasing the likelihood of flooding watershed department of iran wdi 2002 the flood prone areas in iran are estimated to be 91 million ha which means that 55 of the watershed in iran are involved in rapid runoff production of which 42 million ha have moderate to very high flooding susceptibility watershed department of iran wdi 2002 a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from overflow of inland or tidal waters from the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source geravand et al 2020 studies such as jehanzaib et al 2020 ren et al 2002 and wagener et al 2010 show that human activities have greatly disrupted the natural cycles of the environment vegetation degradation activities leading to soil erosion land use changes are examples of human intervention in nature these activities have caused a rapid increase in flood prone areas over the years wheater evans 2009 although flood prevention is not possible using some suitable methods and tools can still be used to identify prone zones properly therefore suitable methods are necessary to reduce flood damage and destructive effects zaalberg et al 2009 it seems that a comprehensive study is needed to identify flood prone areas which can play an effective role in helping policy making and decision making the flood hazard susceptibility mapping fhsm is an important tool to prevent the escalation of flood damage souissi et al 2020 the fhsm determines managers and decision makers can use flood prone areas based on many environmental factors influencing flood formation fhsm as a management dashboard on water resources erosion control and flood damage mitigation wang et al 2019a b because fhsm is made up of several factors the geographic information system gis tool will play an important role in analyzing data layers and generating final maps cao et al 2016 dano et al 2019 in this type of study topographic factors elevation slope aspect etc play an important role in creation of fhsm many hydrological and hydraulic variables such as stream power index spi and topographic wetness index twi are obtained from topographic factors caviedes voullième et al 2012 unfortunately for various reasons not all regions have such data which is very influential in determining the fhsm in recent years the digital elevation model dem has been provided to researchers with high accuracy and acceptance and studies have been conducted in this field jacobsen passini 2010 rainfall runoff models are a useful tool in flood prediction despite the various advantages this method has various limitations such as the need for calibration i e parameter adjustment and long period gauging data depending on the required accuracy and computational cost and time ludwig et al 2003 peel mcmahon 2020 this is especially evident in developing countries due to the lack of gauging stations recently hydrological studies tend to use the overlap index approach equipped with gis and rs tools adlyansah pachri 2019 researchers have used several techniques to determine fhsm including hydrological statistical and machine learning algorithms table 1 shows some of the most common statistical techniques in flood studies multi criteria decision analysis mcda is a tool developed in decision theory to solve operational research problems in this method decision makers weigh a set of evaluation criteria to choose between options mutikanga et al 2011 simonovic 2009 the gis mcdm combination provides an excellent tool to create accurate maps for analyzing areas prone to flood sánchez lozano et al 2013 midatana et al 2018 ali et al 2020 in addition to extensive research and review of models and trends of different approaches the comprehensive evaluation between statistical models and gis mcdm methods in flood areas has not been studied some of the most important advantages of the mcdm method are easy to use and the criteria are not considered proportionate there are several weighting approaches in the mcdm methods used to measure each factor affecting the mcdm method hence the lack of a unique method for weighting is the disadvantage of the mcdm method as an attempt to fill this gap performance appraisal of the developed methods has been considered in this study therefore this study seeks to answer the question of which of the mcdm based statistical methods which approach is more accurate in preparing the fhsm for flood risk mapping to achieve this goal topsis as an mcdm method and two statistical methods evidence belief function ebf and weights of evidence wofe have been adopted to generate fhsm these three methods are applied for the mohammad abad basin ma one of the most important areas because of tobacco cultivation located in golestan province gp in the north of iran according to the comprehensive flood reports of the ministry of energy of iran cfrg 2008 due to the abundance of floods in the region and the destruction of the environment and financial losses and casualties this region is known as a critical region this region is also the center of tobacco cultivation in northern iran which is a reason for the importance of this region various information layers such as hydrological geological topographic and environmental data are required to prepare and validate the fhsm map this paper aims to introduce an alternative to traditional measures for calibrating flood models the proposed method uses receptor performance chart roc features bradley 1997 to visualize organize and select classifiers based on their performance which is increasingly used in machine learning fawcett 2006 the study area production and composition of data layers required for the adopted methods final fhsm extraction and validation of the results of this research are given in the following sections 2 study area methodology and approaches 2 1 study area mohammad abad river is in ma catchment located in golestan province in northern iran this river is located 35 km east of gorgan city the province s capital mousavi et al 2018 the length of the main river which starts from the alborz mountains and continues to the gorganroud river is about 26 km and the catchment area of this river is about 395 km2 which is in the range of longitude 54 to 54 42 and latitude 36 36 to 36 50 fig 1 the maximum and minimum elevation of the study area is equal to 3682 and 18 m a s l respectively due to its location in the alborz mountains the southern parts of this basin have a very steep slope and a mild topography the mean annual rainfall in the ma watershed is around 650 mm prtmk 2011 according to the analysis of the extracted satellite images the lu lc classes in the study area are divided into 8 categories dense forest a 17 5 good range forest b 27 7 rock c 32 7 agriculture d 9 5 agriculture dry farming e 11 urban f 1 5 water g 1 the main lithological units are marl limestone fossiliferous and calcareous sandstone prtmk 2011 2 2 methodology this study is based on different fhsm approaches fig 2 graphically shows the steps of creating this map explained in the following the first step is to create a database provided by flood inventory maps fim and flood related conditioning factors frcfs to achieve the predetermined goals frcfs are extracted from a 1 100 000 geological map landsat 8 oli image digital elevation model dem with a spatial resolution of 30 m and extensive field survey the second stage of research in developing fhsm is testing alignment between flood related conditioning factors frcfs such as elevation slope etc there are several indicators to check for multicollinearity the most common of which are multicollinearity analysis with tolerance tol and variance inflation factor vif for signal alignment between parameters tol must be 0 1 and vif must be 10 arabameri et al 2018 spss tool is used for calculating tol and vif indices using wofe and ebf statistical methods in a gis environment is the third step for fhsm the fourth step is using the topsis and ahp mcdm methods for fhsm finally the performance of statistical and multi criteria methods in fhsm is evaluated in the final stage the efficiency of statistical and multi criteria methods in fhsm is measured by indicators such as the area under the curve auc seed cell area index scai and frequency ratio fr one of the most important prerequisites for fhsm preparation is the flood inventory map al abadi pradhan 2020 it is necessary to analyze its occurrence records to estimate the occurrence of future floods in an area manandhar 2010 thus flood inventory maps are equally important in predicting future disasters and can show one or more events in an area tien bui et al 2012 the level of access to reports and software tools is determined according to the study s objectives based on how to prepare for fim according to flood reports in golestan regional water company 2016 from 2000 to 2020 56 dangerous floods occurred in the study area which resulted in financial and human losses in another report presented by golestan regional water company 2016 one of the most important floods is 29 jul 2015 which occurs with a 100 year return period and a peak flow of 85 m3 s following heavy rains on 29 jul 2015 the ma basin was hit by devastating floods a flood inventory map was prepared by mapping the floodplain area in the ma basin using documentary sources and field surveys fifty six flood sites and flood inventory maps were prepared using these points these flood points are divided into training 75 and validation 25 this division was random so that the scatter of selection was normal distribution across the basin the floods caused about 1 5 million dollars in financial losses and four casualties fig 3 shows some flood damage related to 2015 in the study area several factors are involved in the occurrence of floods known as flood related conditioning factors frcfs examining and evaluating the sensitivity of each of these factors is essential in determining fhsm rahmati et al 2016a b according to the previous studies e g rahmati et al 2016a b arabameri et al 2018 dano et al 2019 dahri abida 2017 effective factors in flood production have been considered in this research the adopted factors include elevation slope of catchment aspect plan curvature topography wetness index twi stream power index spi distance to stream drainage density soil type lithology normalized difference vegetation index ndvi land use land cover lu lc fig 4 plan curvature refers to the amount of change in slope in a particular direction the amount of curvature can be obtained by returning the value of its radius sahana et al 2020 negative and positive curvature values indicate concave and convex surfaces while zero curvature values exhibit flat surfaces the effect of topography on hydrological processes can be analyzed using the topographic wetness index twi twi determines the role of topography in surface saturation which eventually leads to runoff therefore it is a useful indicator for assessing the possible occurrence of floods sahana et al 2020 the index was calculated by considering the upslope and slope of the cells using eq 1 moore et al 1991 where α and tan β represent the cumulative upslope area and hydraulic gradient 1 twi l n α t a n β stream power index spi identifies the areas where surface runoff induced erosion can be reduced through soil conservation measures sahana et al 2020 stream power index spi index is calculated using equation 2 where as and β are specific catchment areas m m2 and slope angle 2 spi a s t a n β normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is an effective criterion for analysing the vegetation characteristics of an area ndvi was calculated using eq 3 mojaddadi et al 2017 nir and r are defined as near infra red and red bands 3 ndvi n i r r n i r r for soil type ma catchment was divided into 3 different sections the usda system is used to classify the soil which describes it in terms of the percentage of clay silt and sand particles due to the fact that the soil is fine grained and consists mainly of silt and clay for more accuracy an attempt has been made to mention the dominant soil in the table to provide more information for example the silty clay loam sandy clay loam class has larger particles such as sand and silt than the silty clay loam clay loam class the digital elevation dem file from gmted2015 https earthexplorer usgs gov arabameri et al 2017 with a resolution of 30 m per pixel was selected as the basis for calculating the topographic parameters other maps used for this study are the geology map 1 100000 the soil type map 1 500000 and the landsat8 image oli tirs with a spatial resolution of 30 m elevation slope and plan curvature are extracted from the dem file using arcgis10 6 tools another computational tool called map algebra in arcgis10 6 enabled the production of spi and twi maps the flow network was extracted from the dem in hydrological tools filling flow direction and flow accumulation to provide distance to flow density and drainage according to previous studies e g amiri et al 2019 jozaghi et al 2018 minimum area for generation of flood is 1 8 km2 based on the area of each pixel of the base image which was 30 30 900 m2 the threshold of 2000 was selected for flow accumulation processing by digitizing the basic geological and soil type maps the study area is divided into 6 and 3 classes respectively the geological classification is shown in table 2 the land use to land cover lu lc was created using the landsat8 image from 22 july 2015 with 162 paths and 35 rows the minimum distance algorithm was used as a supervised classification method to prepare lu lc maps the generated lu lc map was confirmed using 106 ground control points gcp in the field and the kappa coefficient for the generated map was 89 1 kappa is calculated based on the confusion matrix however kappa considers the class distribution imbalance so its interpretation is more complex foody 2020 kappa eliminates the possibility of classifier agreement random guessing and measures the number of predictions table 3 illustrates all factors properties and classes these classes were determined by jenks natural break method this method requires an iterative process therefore the calculations must be repeated using a different failure in the data set to determine which set of failures has the least variance in the class this process begins by dividing the sorted data into classes that may be arbitrary two steps must be repeated first calculating the sum of the squared deviations from the class average and moving one or more data points from one class to another to minimize the sum of the deviations within the class jenks 1967 because the values of the factors have a range of changes and variance they provide better results all factors except geological and soil type maps are extracted from data generated in 2015 so they are natural for a while geological and soil type maps are based on maps prepared by the ministry of agriculture and the geological survey of iran prepared before 1990and use in some studies such as rahmati et al 2016 the assumption in using these two factors is that the geological texture and soil type do not change which seems reasonable due to the time consuming change on these factors 2 3 approaches in the approaches section a complete description of the statistical and mcdm models used in this research is given as mentioned to determine the potential for flood risk various factors have been considered as spatial variables and in order to relate these factors to determination of flood risk some approaches such as statistical and mcdm models are needed that can make this relationship 2 3 1 statistical models evidential belief function ebf weight of evidence wofe statistical models are important part of river hydrology studies for this study use ebf and weight of evidence wofe approach for creation of fhsm a full description of the proposed approach is provided below 2 3 1 1 evidential belief function ebf the dempster shafer model is a statistical process used to identify spatial integrity based on a composite law tehrany kumar 2018 dempster shafer s theory provides a framework for evaluating the evidential belief function ebf based on belief uncertainty this theory is applied with the dempster formula arabameri et al 2019 the ebf is based on four statements bel degree of belief dis degree of disbelief unc degree of uncertainty and pls degree of plausibility fig 5 carranza and hale 2003 bel and pls show the high and low probabilities of a hypothesis respectively bel is always less than or equal to pls the difference between pls and bel is equal to unc which indicates doubts about the validity of the hypothesis if unc 0 then bel pls dis is the belief that the hypothesis is incorrect and equal to 1 pls or 1 unc bel these variables can be calculated by equations 4 9 4 bel c ij w c ijd j 1 m w c ijd 5 w c ijd n c ij d n c ij n d n c ij

number of pixels in the study area respectively pradhan et al 2014 suppose the study area t contains n t pixels and flood d occurs at n d pixels in addition there are several flood conditioning factors spatial evidence maps xi i 1 2 n with classes cij j 1 2 m in this study flood conditioning factors were classified using a quantitative classification scheme n cij indicates the number of pixels in a particular class of a conditional factor for example the number of pixels in the first class of elevation map by overlapping the binary flood inventory map d on each conditional factor map the number of cij pixels that overlap with the d containing pixels i e n cij d the presence of a flood and the number of cij pixels do not overlap with the d containing pixels i e n cij n cij d no flood are detected similarly the hypotheses presented can be generalized to the wofe method all formulas for fhsm determination are given in equations 4 9 2 3 1 2 weights of evidence wofe the weight of evidence wofe method was used by many researchers in various fields such as landslide flood and flash flood proposed for the first time in natural hazard studies agterberg 1992 costache and zaharia 2017 tehrany et al 2014 this method has a major advantage over other statistical methods because it is a data driven method that uses the bayesian probability model this data driven method represents a bayesian bivariate statistical model widely used in geoscience research costache and zaharia 2017 positive weight w and negative weight w must be calculated as basic parameters to implement the wofe method positive or negative weight is measured by wofe based on the presence of any conditional factor b or the absence of any conditioning factor b the presence of disaster a or the absence of disaster a in the area and the probability p we have the following equations 10 w i l n p b a p b a 11 w i l n p b a p b a the weight contrast is the difference between the w and w weights determined by c the c value is positive in the case of a positive relationship and is negative in the case of a negative relationship the standard deviation of w is calculated as equations 12 13 and 14 in which s2 w and s2 w are variances of positive and negative weight n in equations 13 and 14 expresses number of each condition pixels 12 s c s 2 w s 2 w 13 s 2 w 1 n a b 1 n a b 14 s 2 w 1 n a b 1 n a b then the final coefficient wf of each pixel is obtained using the following equation 15 w f c s c 2 3 2 multiple criteria decision making mcdm mcdm models are frequently used for decision systems for this study use the order priority topsis to create fhsm a full description of the proposed approach is provided below 2 3 2 1 topsis topsis known as a useful mcdm model was first introduced by hwang and yoon grömping 2006 topsis is based on the distance between two positive and negative solutions the ideal positive solution is based on the maximum profit and minimum cost while the ideal negative solution is based on the minimum profit and maximum cost arabameri et al 2019 the topsis method can be described in 7 steps as follows luu et al 2019 step 1 setting up decision matrix d d ij step 2 normalized the decision matrix vector normalization is used for the calculation r ij 16 r ij d ij i 1 m d ij 2 i 1 m j 1 n step 3 create a normalized weight decision matrix by multiplying the weight of attributes to each category w j is the weight of the jth attribute 17 v ij w j r ij i 1 m j 1 n step 4 determining positive ideal solution pis and negative ideal solution nis the pis a and nis a are determined based on the weighted normalized values j 1 is a group of benefit attributes and j 2 is a group of cost attributes a v 1 v 2 v j v n 18 a max v ij j j 1 min v ij j j 2 i 1 m a v 1 v 2 v j v n 19 a min v ij j j 1 max v ij j j 2 i 1 m step 5 determine distance from pis d i and nis d i the n dimensional euclidean distance calculates the distance between alternatives di and di are then given by equations 20 and 21 20 d i j 1 n v ij v j 2 i 1 m 21 d i j 1 n v ij v j 2 i 1 m step 6 determine relative closeness to ideal solution 22 c i d i d i d i 0 c i 1 i 1 m step 7 ranking priority a group of alternatives is ranked by descending orderly sorting of c i analytic hierarchy process ahp is used to determine the weight of each mcdm parameter the basis of this method is to calculate the parameters based on the knowledge and skills of specialists for this purpose experts evaluate the factors influencing the occurrence of floods in pairs compared to with each other arabameri et al 2019 numbers 1 to 9 are used to prioritize quantitative and qualitative parameters over each other saaty 1990 odd numbers determine the qualitative limit and even numbers determine the interface between the two qualitative groups table 4 the gis based topsis approach applied the determined weights obtained from the ahp method as input the raw input criterion attribute map layers were first standardized and normalized to attain non dimensional attribute values between 0 and 1 for comparison the corresponding weights from the ahp were then applied to each of the criteria by multiplying each value of the standardized layer by the corresponding weight to obtain a weighted standardized map layer weighted decision matrix identification of the positive ideal solution pis determined from the maximum value for each of the weighted standardized layers and the negative ideal solution nis determined from the minimum value for each of the weighted standardized layers was done from which the separation measures distances from the pis and nis for each of the criteria were determined the relative closeness to the ideal point for each criterion was computed and then ranked by arranging the alternatives in descending order through a classification process to generate the resulting ehm the results of each of the generated earthquake hazard maps ehm from both the ahp and topsis models were thereafter compared and analyzed the gis based topsis approach applied the weights determined by the ahp method as input criteria maps of flood conditioning factors such as slope were first standardized and normalized to achieve non dimensional property values between 0 and 1 for comparison the corresponding weights of ahp were then applied to each of the criteria by multiplying each value of the standardized layer by the corresponding weight to obtain a standard weighted map layer weighted decision matrix for the factors identify the positive ideal solution pis determined by the maximum value for each weighted standard layer and the negative ideal solution nis determined by the minimum value for each weighted standard layer was performed from which the separation distance criteria from pis and nis were determined for each of the criteria the relative proximity to the ideal point for each criterion was calculated and then ranked in descending order by arranging the options through a classification process to generate fhsm for this purpose to implement the mcdm method 200 points are selected using the create random point tool in arcgis10 6 as selected points from the study area then using other tools in arcgis10 6 extract multi values to point the value of the criteria is extracted from the frcfs and finally a 200 by 12 matrix is created the number of rows 200 means the selected points of the area and the number of columns 12 means the causes of floods then in the spss environment the coefficients of the topsis method are extracted and finally created by the arcgis10 6 interpolation tools for the study area 2 3 3 validation method according to one of the paper s objectives the use of a new method for calibration in this study the receptor performance roc has been used the roc curve auc can then be used as a measure reflecting the performance of the different classifiers in a binary or two class classification problem instances belong to either a positive e g flooded or negative e g non flooded class a classification model is generally needed to classify instances to those classes based on an experimental set of labelled samples and a classification model a contingency table or confusion matrix can be created based on which baseline or performance metrics can be calculated the number of positive negative instances that have correctly been classified as positive negative is denoted as true positives negatives tp tn whereas the positive negative instances that have been erroneously classified as negative positive are denoted as false positives negatives fp fn schumann et al 2014 there are four definitions of the roc curve method fawcett 2006 true positive rate tp true negative rate tn false negative rate fn and false positive rate fp high sensitivity reflects a many true predictions while high 1 specificity indicates a high number of false positives the roc curve can be considered as a graph of the sensitivity on the x axis equation 23 and 1 specificity on the y axis equation 24 of the rate for each possible value rahmati pourghasemi 2017 the area under roc that called auc describes the possibility of true prediction x 1 s p e c i f i c i t y 1 t n t n f p y s e n s i t i v i t y t n t p f n seed cell area index scai and frequency ratio fr are based on simple statistical indices used in this study li wang 2019 fr and scai are two common indicators for model classification accuracy analysis ilinca and gheuca 2011 scai is the ratio of the area percentage of each flood to the flood area percentage fr is the ratio of the percentage of flood area to the percentage of the area of each flood class the values of fr and scai indices are inversely related to each other increasing the sensitivity of the classes increasing the fr value and decreasing the scai value indicates an increase in the classification accuracy of the models the fr index varies between 0 and infinity and since the scai index is the inverse of the fr index the range of change is zero to infinity except that in some classes the value of this index is not defined 3 results examining the results of the parameter collinearity indices tol vif the values are between 0 122 and 0 931 and 1 074 8 216 respectively because the tol and vif values are within the acceptable threshold limit so negligible collinearity exists among all frcfs indicating that all frcfs can be used for modeling table 5 shows the result of the collinearity test 3 1 applying ebf and wofe methods by examining the statistical relationship between the frcfs in creating floods four indicators of ebf and wofe methods have been calculated tables 6 and 7 show the results of the ebf and wofe methods respectively in this study the belief bel index of ebf and wofe was used to analyze the occurrence of floods the bel value is between 0 and 1 and it closers to 1 the higher the probability of flood occurrence this range is for the wofe coefficient of all real numbers and the more positive this value is the greater the probability of flood occurrence if this index is equal to zero it is impossible to comment explicitly on it the results of elevation analysis show that the lowest elevations lower than 533 bel 0 29 wofe 1 95 and 533 1263 m bel 0 67 wofe 6 15 had the most impact while the highest elevation 1263 1881 bel 0 04 wofe 2 34 1881 2503 bel 0 wofe 0 and 2503 3682 m bel 0 wofe 0 had the least impact on the flood the results show floods occur mostly in low elevation areas these results show that the probability of flooding decreases with increasing altitude these areas have the greatest inundation potential another important indicator in the occurrence of floods is the slope which according to the analysis and the results obtained shows a direct relationship with flat areas class 0 10 14 with bel 0 48 and wofe 3 86 show the highest probability of flooding therefore it can be concluded that the probability of flood occurrence in flatlands is more than in highland it is also important to note that as the slope increases the flow velocity increases and water absorption decreases accelerating flood formation in flatlands aspect plays a role in flood formation so it was selected for this analysis because of its effect on rainfall and sunlight except for flat land all other classes show this flood index factor most in the southwest sw bel 0 22 wofe 1 59 the results and trend of the aspect outputs like other factors confirm the similarity of the behavior of the selected ebf and wofe indicators regarding the plan curvature floods have occurred in approximately equal proportions in all classes which confirms this hypothesis by examining the results and comparing plan curvature results with ground flood points in the ma catchment twi represents the effect of topography on the location and size of saturated source areas in generating runoff shafapour tehrany et al 2017 consistent with tables 6 and 7 the highest twi class 12 74 shows peak values of bel 0 72 and wofe 5 2 respectively indicating areas at greater risk for flooding according to bel and wofe indicators are directly related to the increase in twi examination of indicators shows the effect of spi on flood formation areas with less stream power are usually more prone to flooding mojaddadi et al 2017 due to the trend of bel and wofe indices increasing spi reduces the probability of flooding most areas with higher spi values are located in mountains and steep areas where floods will not occur distance from the river is one of the most important factors in fhsm the river surface rises due to heavy rainfall during floods and causes water to flood in areas near the river bank distance up to 218 m from the river had the greatest impact on the flood bel 0 8 wofe 5 83 the reverse trend of the indices with the distance from the river factor is quite evident in the results drainage density is a parameter determined based on the characteristics of the catchment and it is directly related to flood formation according to the results class 2 87 5 42 was most likely to flood due to the special characteristics of the catchment such as the shape of the catchment and the geography of the drainage catchment the probability of flood formation for the four classes is almost equal bel and wofe indices confirm the same effect on flood occurrence for example the bel index in four classes is 0 19 0 27 0 25 and 0 3 respectively whose approximate equality represents the equal share of the drainage density factor in the potential for flooding ndvi an index that illustrates the vegetation density in the study area was used in this research vegetation can decrease the speed of the runoff on the ground lei et al 2014 class 0 23 bel 0 57 wofe 4 18 is the most likely option for flood formation because the amount of vegetation to reduce floods is minimal a geology map was used in the research as this factor significantly influences on the flood formation on the ground tehrany and kumar 2018 in the study area of the ten lithology types the ratio was highest for the f class bel 0 39 wofe 1 89 this class contains dark grey shale and sandstone soil type directly impacts on water storage permeability and drainage mojaddadi et al 2017 according to soil science reports 90 percent of the study area is covered by silty clay loam clay loam which is naturally more likely to occur in this area in the bel index the silty clay loam clay loam class coefficient is twice that of other classes indicating the high potential of areas with such soil but the wofe index does not show the soil type factor well lu lc is a very important factor in identifying flood sensitive areas vegetated areas provide protection mechanisms that make the land less prone to flooding therefore there is a negative relationship between flood occurrence and vegetation density conversely urban areas increase the stormwater runoff due to large impermeable surfaces shafapour tehrany et al 2017 agricultural lands are known as flood prone areas considering urban areas as the most vulnerable areas to floods urban areas with bel 0 64 and wofe 5 04 show the highest probability of flooding after the urban area agricultural lands with bel 0 17 and wofe 2 46 have more potential for flooding one of the reasons for the high levels of these values is the double period cultivation in the region because during the growing season and depending on the type of crop due to possibility of irrigation and soil saturation the risk of flooding increases according to the general study of the factors leading to floods some factors such as elevation slope and lu lc are sensitive to class changes the number and percentage of flood points change drastically by changing the class range in contrast factors such as geology and soil type have a uniform distribution and have an insignificant effect on the percentage some factors such as slope elevation and spi constantly change with the flood for instance with decreasing elevation the probability of flood also decreases in contrast a factor such as an aspect changes non uniformly therefore the performance and behavior of the factors leading to fhsm are different the values obtained from the four functions of the ebf method are shown in fig 6 a the bel index values ranged from 1 43 to 6 06 and the dis index values ranged from 1 64 to 3 25 fig 6b in this study the bel function was used for fhsm and values of bel were divided into five classes based on the natural break method fig 7 1 43 1 95 very low 1 95 2 45 low 2 45 3 42 moderate 3 42 4 48 high and 4 48 6 06 very high the wofe values ranged from 2 56 to 45 72 these values were divided into five classes using the natural break method fig 8 21 98 to 9 75 very low 9 75 to 1 74 low 1 74 to 5 08 moderate 5 08 14 03 high and 14 03 34 71 very high table 9 according to the ebf method most of the studied catchment is moderate in flood probability 50 60 according to this index other classes very high high low and very low are 1 87 24 98 22 48 and 0 07 respectively similar to the ebf method the result of wofe method are as follows very high 8 76 high 20 92 moderate 24 68 low 26 11 and very low 19 53 table 9 3 2 applying the topsis mcdm method by examining the results of the questionnaires answered by flood experts the weight of each factor based on the ahp method is presented according to fig 9 lyu et al 2020 questionnaires were distributed among 20 geologists hydrologists and water experts who have the required knowledge about golestan basin to score each factor for topsis method these questionnaires were compared in pairs and a score between 0 and 9 was obtained finally by the ahp method each numerical factor was assigned between 0 and 1 slope distance from river and geological factors with weights of 0 25 0 16 and 0 11 respectively have the most role in flood formation the aspect factor with a weight of 0 02 has the least effect in flood formation as mentioned in the methodology section 200 random points are selected to apply the topsis method table 8 shows the calculations of topsis coefficients with a few examples of random points after determining the weight of parameters and creating fhsm indicators such as the ebf and wofe methods they were categorized from very low to very high in 5 classes according to the results of the topsis method the low class with 28 87 and the high class with 11 62 cover the maximum and minimum area respectively table 9 fig 10 shows fhsm based on the topsis method 3 3 validation of models the fhsm map is derived from the ebf wofe and topsis methods and shows different efficiency validity validation should be done to determine which model is more reliable based on the analysis the topsis method has an accuracy of 92 83 also wofe and ebf methods have 88 57 and 83 01 accuracy respectively fig 11 auc analysis shows that the accuracy of the topsis method with the prediction rate method is equal to 84 23 which is higher than wofe method 76 26 and ebf method 62 51 fig 12 the fr and scai indices in table 9 also confirm that the topsis model is accurate by examining the fhsm maps the accuracy of the topsis method in the northern regions especially at the basin outlet is closer to reality due to its compliance with the historical flood records registered in government organizations such as the ministry of energy a significant point in the error related to statistical models is the lack of flood spots in the mentioned areas which has reduced the accuracy in explaining this discussion we can refer to the lack of reference in government documents to record flood runoff at a distance from the river which overshadows the validity and accuracy of the model at a distance from the river 4 discussion natural hazards can vary depending on their severity and magnitude on the other hand this type of event causes a lot of financial and human losses therefore predicting this occurrence with the exiting tools seems necessary because it is very effective in policy making and decision making before during and after the occurrence tsakiris 2007 flood hazard susceptibility mapping fhsm is a basic and simple method used by governments for flood control policy cao et al 2016 the result of fhsm is the identification of flood prone areas based on factors affecting floods dahri abida 2017 identifying and classifying flood prone areas can significantly reduce casualties and losses yariyan et al 2020a b geographic information systems gis and remote sensing techniques rs have significantly contributed to the study of multidimensional events such as floods this has been made possible by extracting of frcfs such as slope drainage density etc for flood analysis tang et al 2018 in this study two statistical methods and the mcdm method gis and rs were used to determine fhsm in northern iran ebf and wofe methods have been used in the statistical method to create fhsm due to their high efficiency in natural hazard studies so 12 factors affecting flood generation and 56 flood points were used although ebf and wofe methods have complex computational processes they have many advantages including combining different source reliability and relative flexibility for accepting uncertainty arabameri et al 2017 li wang 2019 tehrany et al 2014 one of the disadvantages of this model is the lack of proper response to zero occurrences in a class the second method uses the topsis method to determine the fhsm which is not very common in flood mapping one of the most important advantages of this method is the lack of need for recent flood information for this reason in areas where flood information is not recorded this method can be used to determine the fhsm the most prominent features of this model are the conversion of quantitative and qualitative criteria to each other quantitative weighting compatibility of factors its flexibility against different inputs and analysis of responses and ease of implementation lai et al 1994 ahp is a method of weighting mcdm models that can determine the weight of each factor the ahp method hierarchically allows the collection of ideas according to the results of the ahp method slope distance from river and geology factors have the highest weight in causing floods which is consistent with the studies arabameri et al 2017 kalantari et al 2014 ahmadisharaf et al 2016 tehrany kumar 2018 the degree of slope has a great effect on the flood flow because it regulates the infiltration rate of the runoff and its volume and speed riggs 1976 distance from the river affects the spread and magnitude of the flood and causes inundation tehrany et al 2014 different geological structures also directly or indirectly affect flood formation magilligan 1992 although the nature of mcdm models is completely different from statistical logistic regression the comparison of apples with apples is not very common still according to the validation methods the mcdm model has higher accuracy than statistical models in creating fhsm in statistical methods ebf and wofe have almost the same accuracy this is similar to the efficiency of the ebf and wofe methods in evaluating landslide susceptibility mapping for the muchuan county in china from which ebf method auc 79 1 had higher prediction accuracy than the wofe method auc 75 3 li wang 2019 yariyan et al 2020 examined ebf fr and ordered weight average owa in flood susceptibility mapping for saqqez in iran using nine flood conditioning factors slope rainfall slope length topographic wetness index slope aspect altitude curvature distance from river geology and land use land cover and concluded that the ebf method auc 0 951 had higher accuracy than the other two models fr is not widely used to validate fhsm results therefore the findings of this study are correlated with previous studies arabameri et al 2019 cao et al 2016 costache et al 2020 rahmati et al 2016a b sahana patel 2019 samanta et al 2018 shafapour tehrany et al 2017 siahkamari et al 2018 however the evaluation of the findings in this study indicated that the fr also exhibited high accuracy because the extent of areas with high to very high floods was more consistent with ground data creating forecast maps for high potential flood areas interpreted in this study will greatly assist water policymakers in making decisions to reduce flood damage in 2018 tehrany and kumar assessed and prepared a possible flood map in brisbane australia in this study the three methods of ebf fr and logistic regression lr were compared leading to the ebf method s superiority another study conducted by hong in 2018 in a region of china compared wofe and support vector methods for evaluating and generating flood maps the combination of the fuzzy model and wofe has been evaluated to increase accuracy and usability similar to the two studies this current study s findings also show that slope is the vital frcf in flood generation in 2018 yang et al used the topsis method and compared it with a statistical method shannon entropy in the hainan region of china in this study the accuracy of the topsis method was higher than the statistical method which confirms the results of this study however this study presents its new application by considering the maximum frcfs with one mcdm and two statistical models using three validation methods auroc curve seed cell area index and frequency ratio methods 5 conclusions in flood hazard susceptibility mapping the purpose of statistical and mcdm models is to discover the most appropriate model to describe the correlation between the presence or absence of flood dependent factor and a set of conditional factors independent variables today with water prevention policies tools such as flood risk mapping have been widely developed to assist management and strategy in infrastructure decisions in the present study three methods of ebf and wofe statistical models and topsis mcdm model methods are compared statistical approaches use inventory data sample based on the relationship between dependent variables which include the presence or absence of floods and independent or conditional variables based on those correlations few predictions are made for areas that are currently flood free but with similar conditions ebf and wofe have an additional advantage that can evaluate the correlation between conditional factors using mathematic rules to achieve this goal in this study the fhsm results of the ma catchment obtained using the topsis ebf and wofe were evaluated using three statistical validation methods with 56 ground point data in addition 12 frcfs were considered for the three fhsm modelling methods applied in this study the results showed that the topsis is superior to the ebf and wofe methods using the ahp method on 12 factors affecting flood formation the role of the slope distance from the river and geology of the region have been determined as related this study suggests that gis and rs techniques and their combination with statistical methods and mcdm can provide results with appropriate accuracy from the authors point of view some of the advantages of the statistical method can be highlighted including the fact that patterns and correlations are clear and visible taken from large samples so high generalizability can be used and re used to check different variables can be imitated to check changes which increase reliability and representativeness on the other hand the obvious limitations include the inability to check validity not to find a mechanism for causality theory but only to draw patterns and correlations from data statistical data are often secondary data meaning that they can easily be misinterpreted statistical data can be misused it can be manipulated and phrased to indicate what the researcher wants to show affects objectivity the mcdm method especially topsis has advantages such as the ability to apply discrete alternative challenges are the most important approaches to solving real world problems and can immediately identify suitable alternatives in addition the paired comparison reduces the requirements and the capacity constraint may not significantly control the process the mcdm has two important limitations first the lack of prediction for weight extraction and the examination of the consistency of judgments second mcdm does not consider the relative importance of distances although the approaches done in a sub basin of gorganroud the results obtained in this paper can be used as a guide for the implementation of statistical methods and multi criteria decision in other sub basins of this gorganroud basin which has a temperate climate and statistics data are enough in this study two general statistical approaches and multi criteria decision making have been evaluated in preparing fhsm however it is suggested that conceptual models be compared with the models adopted for future research in addition other contributing factors e g antecedent soil moisture condition climatic factors may also be considered as input data layers declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
3203,accurate mapping of flood risk areas is the basis for providing basic information on flood hazard reduction strategies and facilitates the relocation process this study compared statistical approaches and multi criteria decision making mcdm in flood hazard susceptibility mapping fhsm the performance of two statistical methods the evidential belief function ebf and weight of evidence woe was compared with the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis as an mcdm technique mohammad abad catchment known as one of the flood susceptible areas in northern iran was selected as a case study a 100 year flood event with a peak flow of 85 m3 s known as the most severe flood in the study catchment during the last 20 years 2000 2020 is considered a basis for selected modelling and evaluation the accuracy and efficiency of the adopted methods were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic auroc curve seed cell surface index and

topographic wetness index twi stream power index spi distance from the river drainage density ndvi geology soil type and land use land cover were used as flood related conditional factors the results of the mcdm method showed that the slope of the catchment is the most important factor in flood formation with a relative weight of 0 25 by examining the validity of the methods topsis showed the highest efficiency auc 0 8423 followed by wofe auc 0 7686 and ebf methods auc 0 6251 based on the frequency ratio and values of seed cell surface index the mcdm approach shows better performance than

mohammad abad catchment data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction floods are one of the most common natural hazards that cause loss of life and property worldwide jonkman 2005 death tolls from flooding have risen in many parts of the world between 1994 and 2013 244 000 people were killed by floods in the same period 2 5 billion people were affected by flood disasters unisdr cred 2015 flood is a phenomenon that occurs at different intervals with various intensities the flood event as a probabilistic phenomenon needs to be predicted wan mohtar et al 2020 precise prediction can have a significant effect on reducing damages grothmann reusswig 2006 however flooding is a complex phenomenon controlled by many physical factors and therefore its prediction remains challenging kalantari et al 2014 population increase and the rapid growth of urban development and deforestation have increased the risk of flooding in many areas in iran ahmadisharaf et al 2016 3 700 floods have been reported in the last 60 years in iran while the damage caused by floods has increased by 250 in the last decade arabameri et al 2019 using five high resolution climatic models in the watershed department of iran wdi hydrologists have concluded that from 2025 to 2049 compared to 1980 2004 iran is more likely to have long dry periods with experience of heavy rainfall between them which is a sign of increasing the likelihood of flooding watershed department of iran wdi 2002 the flood prone areas in iran are estimated to be 91 million ha which means that 55 of the watershed in iran are involved in rapid runoff production of which 42 million ha have moderate to very high flooding susceptibility watershed department of iran wdi 2002 a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from overflow of inland or tidal waters from the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source geravand et al 2020 studies such as jehanzaib et al 2020 ren et al 2002 and wagener et al 2010 show that human activities have greatly disrupted the natural cycles of the environment vegetation degradation activities leading to soil erosion land use changes are examples of human intervention in nature these activities have caused a rapid increase in flood prone areas over the years wheater evans 2009 although flood prevention is not possible using some suitable methods and tools can still be used to identify prone zones properly therefore suitable methods are necessary to reduce flood damage and destructive effects zaalberg et al 2009 it seems that a comprehensive study is needed to identify flood prone areas which can play an effective role in helping policy making and decision making the flood hazard susceptibility mapping fhsm is an important tool to prevent the escalation of flood damage souissi et al 2020 the fhsm determines managers and decision makers can use flood prone areas based on many environmental factors influencing flood formation fhsm as a management dashboard on water resources erosion control and flood damage mitigation wang et al 2019a b because fhsm is made up of several factors the geographic information system gis tool will play an important role in analyzing data layers and generating final maps cao et al 2016 dano et al 2019 in this type of study topographic factors elevation slope aspect etc play an important role in creation of fhsm many hydrological and hydraulic variables such as stream power index spi and topographic wetness index twi are obtained from topographic factors caviedes voullième et al 2012 unfortunately for various reasons not all regions have such data which is very influential in determining the fhsm in recent years the digital elevation model dem has been provided to researchers with high accuracy and acceptance and studies have been conducted in this field jacobsen passini 2010 rainfall runoff models are a useful tool in flood prediction despite the various advantages this method has various limitations such as the need for calibration i e parameter adjustment and long period gauging data depending on the required accuracy and computational cost and time ludwig et al 2003 peel mcmahon 2020 this is especially evident in developing countries due to the lack of gauging stations recently hydrological studies tend to use the overlap index approach equipped with gis and rs tools adlyansah pachri 2019 researchers have used several techniques to determine fhsm including hydrological statistical and machine learning algorithms table 1 shows some of the most common statistical techniques in flood studies multi criteria decision analysis mcda is a tool developed in decision theory to solve operational research problems in this method decision makers weigh a set of evaluation criteria to choose between options mutikanga et al 2011 simonovic 2009 the gis mcdm combination provides an excellent tool to create accurate maps for analyzing areas prone to flood sánchez lozano et al 2013 midatana et al 2018 ali et al 2020 in addition to extensive research and review of models and trends of different approaches the comprehensive evaluation between statistical models and gis mcdm methods in flood areas has not been studied some of the most important advantages of the mcdm method are easy to use and the criteria are not considered proportionate there are several weighting approaches in the mcdm methods used to measure each factor affecting the mcdm method hence the lack of a unique method for weighting is the disadvantage of the mcdm method as an attempt to fill this gap performance appraisal of the developed methods has been considered in this study therefore this study seeks to answer the question of which of the mcdm based statistical methods which approach is more accurate in preparing the fhsm for flood risk mapping to achieve this goal topsis as an mcdm method and two statistical methods evidence belief function ebf and weights of evidence wofe have been adopted to generate fhsm these three methods are applied for the mohammad abad basin ma one of the most important areas because of tobacco cultivation located in golestan province gp in the north of iran according to the comprehensive flood reports of the ministry of energy of iran cfrg 2008 due to the abundance of floods in the region and the destruction of the environment and financial losses and casualties this region is known as a critical region this region is also the center of tobacco cultivation in northern iran which is a reason for the importance of this region various information layers such as hydrological geological topographic and environmental data are required to prepare and validate the fhsm map this paper aims to introduce an alternative to traditional measures for calibrating flood models the proposed method uses receptor performance chart roc features bradley 1997 to visualize organize and select classifiers based on their performance which is increasingly used in machine learning fawcett 2006 the study area production and composition of data layers required for the adopted methods final fhsm extraction and validation of the results of this research are given in the following sections 2 study area methodology and approaches 2 1 study area mohammad abad river is in ma catchment located in golestan province in northern iran this river is located 35 km east of gorgan city the province s capital mousavi et al 2018 the length of the main river which starts from the alborz mountains and continues to the gorganroud river is about 26 km and the catchment area of this river is about 395 km2 which is in the range of longitude 54 to 54 42 and latitude 36 36 to 36 50 fig 1 the maximum and minimum elevation of the study area is equal to 3682 and 18 m a s l respectively due to its location in the alborz mountains the southern parts of this basin have a very steep slope and a mild topography the mean annual rainfall in the ma watershed is around 650 mm prtmk 2011 according to the analysis of the extracted satellite images the lu lc classes in the study area are divided into 8 categories dense forest a 17 5 good range forest b 27 7 rock c 32 7 agriculture d 9 5 agriculture dry farming e 11 urban f 1 5 water g 1 the main lithological units are marl limestone fossiliferous and calcareous sandstone prtmk 2011 2 2 methodology this study is based on different fhsm approaches fig 2 graphically shows the steps of creating this map explained in the following the first step is to create a database provided by flood inventory maps fim and flood related conditioning factors frcfs to achieve the predetermined goals frcfs are extracted from a 1 100 000 geological map landsat 8 oli image digital elevation model dem with a spatial resolution of 30 m and extensive field survey the second stage of research in developing fhsm is testing alignment between flood related conditioning factors frcfs such as elevation slope etc there are several indicators to check for multicollinearity the most common of which are multicollinearity analysis with tolerance tol and variance inflation factor vif for signal alignment between parameters tol must be 0 1 and vif must be 10 arabameri et al 2018 spss tool is used for calculating tol and vif indices using wofe and ebf statistical methods in a gis environment is the third step for fhsm the fourth step is using the topsis and ahp mcdm methods for fhsm finally the performance of statistical and multi criteria methods in fhsm is evaluated in the final stage the efficiency of statistical and multi criteria methods in fhsm is measured by indicators such as the area under the curve auc seed cell area index scai and frequency ratio fr one of the most important prerequisites for fhsm preparation is the flood inventory map al abadi pradhan 2020 it is necessary to analyze its occurrence records to estimate the occurrence of future floods in an area manandhar 2010 thus flood inventory maps are equally important in predicting future disasters and can show one or more events in an area tien bui et al 2012 the level of access to reports and software tools is determined according to the study s objectives based on how to prepare for fim according to flood reports in golestan regional water company 2016 from 2000 to 2020 56 dangerous floods occurred in the study area which resulted in financial and human losses in another report presented by golestan regional water company 2016 one of the most important floods is 29 jul 2015 which occurs with a 100 year return period and a peak flow of 85 m3 s following heavy rains on 29 jul 2015 the ma basin was hit by devastating floods a flood inventory map was prepared by mapping the floodplain area in the ma basin using documentary sources and field surveys fifty six flood sites and flood inventory maps were prepared using these points these flood points are divided into training 75 and validation 25 this division was random so that the scatter of selection was normal distribution across the basin the floods caused about 1 5 million dollars in financial losses and four casualties fig 3 shows some flood damage related to 2015 in the study area several factors are involved in the occurrence of floods known as flood related conditioning factors frcfs examining and evaluating the sensitivity of each of these factors is essential in determining fhsm rahmati et al 2016a b according to the previous studies e g rahmati et al 2016a b arabameri et al 2018 dano et al 2019 dahri abida 2017 effective factors in flood production have been considered in this research the adopted factors include elevation slope of catchment aspect plan curvature topography wetness index twi stream power index spi distance to stream drainage density soil type lithology normalized difference vegetation index ndvi land use land cover lu lc fig 4 plan curvature refers to the amount of change in slope in a particular direction the amount of curvature can be obtained by returning the value of its radius sahana et al 2020 negative and positive curvature values indicate concave and convex surfaces while zero curvature values exhibit flat surfaces the effect of topography on hydrological processes can be analyzed using the topographic wetness index twi twi determines the role of topography in surface saturation which eventually leads to runoff therefore it is a useful indicator for assessing the possible occurrence of floods sahana et al 2020 the index was calculated by considering the upslope and slope of the cells using eq 1 moore et al 1991 where α and tan β represent the cumulative upslope area and hydraulic gradient 1 twi l n α t a n β stream power index spi identifies the areas where surface runoff induced erosion can be reduced through soil conservation measures sahana et al 2020 stream power index spi index is calculated using equation 2 where as and β are specific catchment areas m m2 and slope angle 2 spi a s t a n β normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is an effective criterion for analysing the vegetation characteristics of an area ndvi was calculated using eq 3 mojaddadi et al 2017 nir and r are defined as near infra red and red bands 3 ndvi n i r r n i r r for soil type ma catchment was divided into 3 different sections the usda system is used to classify the soil which describes it in terms of the percentage of clay silt and sand particles due to the fact that the soil is fine grained and consists mainly of silt and clay for more accuracy an attempt has been made to mention the dominant soil in the table to provide more information for example the silty clay loam sandy clay loam class has larger particles such as sand and silt than the silty clay loam clay loam class the digital elevation dem file from gmted2015 https earthexplorer usgs gov arabameri et al 2017 with a resolution of 30 m per pixel was selected as the basis for calculating the topographic parameters other maps used for this study are the geology map 1 100000 the soil type map 1 500000 and the landsat8 image oli tirs with a spatial resolution of 30 m elevation slope and plan curvature are extracted from the dem file using arcgis10 6 tools another computational tool called map algebra in arcgis10 6 enabled the production of spi and twi maps the flow network was extracted from the dem in hydrological tools filling flow direction and flow accumulation to provide distance to flow density and drainage according to previous studies e g amiri et al 2019 jozaghi et al 2018 minimum area for generation of flood is 1 8 km2 based on the area of each pixel of the base image which was 30 30 900 m2 the threshold of 2000 was selected for flow accumulation processing by digitizing the basic geological and soil type maps the study area is divided into 6 and 3 classes respectively the geological classification is shown in table 2 the land use to land cover lu lc was created using the landsat8 image from 22 july 2015 with 162 paths and 35 rows the minimum distance algorithm was used as a supervised classification method to prepare lu lc maps the generated lu lc map was confirmed using 106 ground control points gcp in the field and the kappa coefficient for the generated map was 89 1 kappa is calculated based on the confusion matrix however kappa considers the class distribution imbalance so its interpretation is more complex foody 2020 kappa eliminates the possibility of classifier agreement random guessing and measures the number of predictions table 3 illustrates all factors properties and classes these classes were determined by jenks natural break method this method requires an iterative process therefore the calculations must be repeated using a different failure in the data set to determine which set of failures has the least variance in the class this process begins by dividing the sorted data into classes that may be arbitrary two steps must be repeated first calculating the sum of the squared deviations from the class average and moving one or more data points from one class to another to minimize the sum of the deviations within the class jenks 1967 because the values of the factors have a range of changes and variance they provide better results all factors except geological and soil type maps are extracted from data generated in 2015 so they are natural for a while geological and soil type maps are based on maps prepared by the ministry of agriculture and the geological survey of iran prepared before 1990and use in some studies such as rahmati et al 2016 the assumption in using these two factors is that the geological texture and soil type do not change which seems reasonable due to the time consuming change on these factors 2 3 approaches in the approaches section a complete description of the statistical and mcdm models used in this research is given as mentioned to determine the potential for flood risk various factors have been considered as spatial variables and in order to relate these factors to determination of flood risk some approaches such as statistical and mcdm models are needed that can make this relationship 2 3 1 statistical models evidential belief function ebf weight of evidence wofe statistical models are important part of river hydrology studies for this study use ebf and weight of evidence wofe approach for creation of fhsm a full description of the proposed approach is provided below 2 3 1 1 evidential belief function ebf the dempster shafer model is a statistical process used to identify spatial integrity based on a composite law tehrany kumar 2018 dempster shafer s theory provides a framework for evaluating the evidential belief function ebf based on belief uncertainty this theory is applied with the dempster formula arabameri et al 2019 the ebf is based on four statements bel degree of belief dis degree of disbelief unc degree of uncertainty and pls degree of plausibility fig 5 carranza and hale 2003 bel and pls show the high and low probabilities of a hypothesis respectively bel is always less than or equal to pls the difference between pls and bel is equal to unc which indicates doubts about the validity of the hypothesis if unc 0 then bel pls dis is the belief that the hypothesis is incorrect and equal to 1 pls or 1 unc bel these variables can be calculated by equations 4 9 4 bel c ij w c ijd j 1 m w c ijd 5 w c ijd n c ij d n c ij n d n c ij

number of pixels in the study area respectively pradhan et al 2014 suppose the study area t contains n t pixels and flood d occurs at n d pixels in addition there are several flood conditioning factors spatial evidence maps xi i 1 2 n with classes cij j 1 2 m in this study flood conditioning factors were classified using a quantitative classification scheme n cij indicates the number of pixels in a particular class of a conditional factor for example the number of pixels in the first class of elevation map by overlapping the binary flood inventory map d on each conditional factor map the number of cij pixels that overlap with the d containing pixels i e n cij d the presence of a flood and the number of cij pixels do not overlap with the d containing pixels i e n cij n cij d no flood are detected similarly the hypotheses presented can be generalized to the wofe method all formulas for fhsm determination are given in equations 4 9 2 3 1 2 weights of evidence wofe the weight of evidence wofe method was used by many researchers in various fields such as landslide flood and flash flood proposed for the first time in natural hazard studies agterberg 1992 costache and zaharia 2017 tehrany et al 2014 this method has a major advantage over other statistical methods because it is a data driven method that uses the bayesian probability model this data driven method represents a bayesian bivariate statistical model widely used in geoscience research costache and zaharia 2017 positive weight w and negative weight w must be calculated as basic parameters to implement the wofe method positive or negative weight is measured by wofe based on the presence of any conditional factor b or the absence of any conditioning factor b the presence of disaster a or the absence of disaster a in the area and the probability p we have the following equations 10 w i l n p b a p b a 11 w i l n p b a p b a the weight contrast is the difference between the w and w weights determined by c the c value is positive in the case of a positive relationship and is negative in the case of a negative relationship the standard deviation of w is calculated as equations 12 13 and 14 in which s2 w and s2 w are variances of positive and negative weight n in equations 13 and 14 expresses number of each condition pixels 12 s c s 2 w s 2 w 13 s 2 w 1 n a b 1 n a b 14 s 2 w 1 n a b 1 n a b then the final coefficient wf of each pixel is obtained using the following equation 15 w f c s c 2 3 2 multiple criteria decision making mcdm mcdm models are frequently used for decision systems for this study use the order priority topsis to create fhsm a full description of the proposed approach is provided below 2 3 2 1 topsis topsis known as a useful mcdm model was first introduced by hwang and yoon grömping 2006 topsis is based on the distance between two positive and negative solutions the ideal positive solution is based on the maximum profit and minimum cost while the ideal negative solution is based on the minimum profit and maximum cost arabameri et al 2019 the topsis method can be described in 7 steps as follows luu et al 2019 step 1 setting up decision matrix d d ij step 2 normalized the decision matrix vector normalization is used for the calculation r ij 16 r ij d ij i 1 m d ij 2 i 1 m j 1 n step 3 create a normalized weight decision matrix by multiplying the weight of attributes to each category w j is the weight of the jth attribute 17 v ij w j r ij i 1 m j 1 n step 4 determining positive ideal solution pis and negative ideal solution nis the pis a and nis a are determined based on the weighted normalized values j 1 is a group of benefit attributes and j 2 is a group of cost attributes a v 1 v 2 v j v n 18 a max v ij j j 1 min v ij j j 2 i 1 m a v 1 v 2 v j v n 19 a min v ij j j 1 max v ij j j 2 i 1 m step 5 determine distance from pis d i and nis d i the n dimensional euclidean distance calculates the distance between alternatives di and di are then given by equations 20 and 21 20 d i j 1 n v ij v j 2 i 1 m 21 d i j 1 n v ij v j 2 i 1 m step 6 determine relative closeness to ideal solution 22 c i d i d i d i 0 c i 1 i 1 m step 7 ranking priority a group of alternatives is ranked by descending orderly sorting of c i analytic hierarchy process ahp is used to determine the weight of each mcdm parameter the basis of this method is to calculate the parameters based on the knowledge and skills of specialists for this purpose experts evaluate the factors influencing the occurrence of floods in pairs compared to with each other arabameri et al 2019 numbers 1 to 9 are used to prioritize quantitative and qualitative parameters over each other saaty 1990 odd numbers determine the qualitative limit and even numbers determine the interface between the two qualitative groups table 4 the gis based topsis approach applied the determined weights obtained from the ahp method as input the raw input criterion attribute map layers were first standardized and normalized to attain non dimensional attribute values between 0 and 1 for comparison the corresponding weights from the ahp were then applied to each of the criteria by multiplying each value of the standardized layer by the corresponding weight to obtain a weighted standardized map layer weighted decision matrix identification of the positive ideal solution pis determined from the maximum value for each of the weighted standardized layers and the negative ideal solution nis determined from the minimum value for each of the weighted standardized layers was done from which the separation measures distances from the pis and nis for each of the criteria were determined the relative closeness to the ideal point for each criterion was computed and then ranked by arranging the alternatives in descending order through a classification process to generate the resulting ehm the results of each of the generated earthquake hazard maps ehm from both the ahp and topsis models were thereafter compared and analyzed the gis based topsis approach applied the weights determined by the ahp method as input criteria maps of flood conditioning factors such as slope were first standardized and normalized to achieve non dimensional property values between 0 and 1 for comparison the corresponding weights of ahp were then applied to each of the criteria by multiplying each value of the standardized layer by the corresponding weight to obtain a standard weighted map layer weighted decision matrix for the factors identify the positive ideal solution pis determined by the maximum value for each weighted standard layer and the negative ideal solution nis determined by the minimum value for each weighted standard layer was performed from which the separation distance criteria from pis and nis were determined for each of the criteria the relative proximity to the ideal point for each criterion was calculated and then ranked in descending order by arranging the options through a classification process to generate fhsm for this purpose to implement the mcdm method 200 points are selected using the create random point tool in arcgis10 6 as selected points from the study area then using other tools in arcgis10 6 extract multi values to point the value of the criteria is extracted from the frcfs and finally a 200 by 12 matrix is created the number of rows 200 means the selected points of the area and the number of columns 12 means the causes of floods then in the spss environment the coefficients of the topsis method are extracted and finally created by the arcgis10 6 interpolation tools for the study area 2 3 3 validation method according to one of the paper s objectives the use of a new method for calibration in this study the receptor performance roc has been used the roc curve auc can then be used as a measure reflecting the performance of the different classifiers in a binary or two class classification problem instances belong to either a positive e g flooded or negative e g non flooded class a classification model is generally needed to classify instances to those classes based on an experimental set of labelled samples and a classification model a contingency table or confusion matrix can be created based on which baseline or performance metrics can be calculated the number of positive negative instances that have correctly been classified as positive negative is denoted as true positives negatives tp tn whereas the positive negative instances that have been erroneously classified as negative positive are denoted as false positives negatives fp fn schumann et al 2014 there are four definitions of the roc curve method fawcett 2006 true positive rate tp true negative rate tn false negative rate fn and false positive rate fp high sensitivity reflects a many true predictions while high 1 specificity indicates a high number of false positives the roc curve can be considered as a graph of the sensitivity on the x axis equation 23 and 1 specificity on the y axis equation 24 of the rate for each possible value rahmati pourghasemi 2017 the area under roc that called auc describes the possibility of true prediction x 1 s p e c i f i c i t y 1 t n t n f p y s e n s i t i v i t y t n t p f n seed cell area index scai and frequency ratio fr are based on simple statistical indices used in this study li wang 2019 fr and scai are two common indicators for model classification accuracy analysis ilinca and gheuca 2011 scai is the ratio of the area percentage of each flood to the flood area percentage fr is the ratio of the percentage of flood area to the percentage of the area of each flood class the values of fr and scai indices are inversely related to each other increasing the sensitivity of the classes increasing the fr value and decreasing the scai value indicates an increase in the classification accuracy of the models the fr index varies between 0 and infinity and since the scai index is the inverse of the fr index the range of change is zero to infinity except that in some classes the value of this index is not defined 3 results examining the results of the parameter collinearity indices tol vif the values are between 0 122 and 0 931 and 1 074 8 216 respectively because the tol and vif values are within the acceptable threshold limit so negligible collinearity exists among all frcfs indicating that all frcfs can be used for modeling table 5 shows the result of the collinearity test 3 1 applying ebf and wofe methods by examining the statistical relationship between the frcfs in creating floods four indicators of ebf and wofe methods have been calculated tables 6 and 7 show the results of the ebf and wofe methods respectively in this study the belief bel index of ebf and wofe was used to analyze the occurrence of floods the bel value is between 0 and 1 and it closers to 1 the higher the probability of flood occurrence this range is for the wofe coefficient of all real numbers and the more positive this value is the greater the probability of flood occurrence if this index is equal to zero it is impossible to comment explicitly on it the results of elevation analysis show that the lowest elevations lower than 533 bel 0 29 wofe 1 95 and 533 1263 m bel 0 67 wofe 6 15 had the most impact while the highest elevation 1263 1881 bel 0 04 wofe 2 34 1881 2503 bel 0 wofe 0 and 2503 3682 m bel 0 wofe 0 had the least impact on the flood the results show floods occur mostly in low elevation areas these results show that the probability of flooding decreases with increasing altitude these areas have the greatest inundation potential another important indicator in the occurrence of floods is the slope which according to the analysis and the results obtained shows a direct relationship with flat areas class 0 10 14 with bel 0 48 and wofe 3 86 show the highest probability of flooding therefore it can be concluded that the probability of flood occurrence in flatlands is more than in highland it is also important to note that as the slope increases the flow velocity increases and water absorption decreases accelerating flood formation in flatlands aspect plays a role in flood formation so it was selected for this analysis because of its effect on rainfall and sunlight except for flat land all other classes show this flood index factor most in the southwest sw bel 0 22 wofe 1 59 the results and trend of the aspect outputs like other factors confirm the similarity of the behavior of the selected ebf and wofe indicators regarding the plan curvature floods have occurred in approximately equal proportions in all classes which confirms this hypothesis by examining the results and comparing plan curvature results with ground flood points in the ma catchment twi represents the effect of topography on the location and size of saturated source areas in generating runoff shafapour tehrany et al 2017 consistent with tables 6 and 7 the highest twi class 12 74 shows peak values of bel 0 72 and wofe 5 2 respectively indicating areas at greater risk for flooding according to bel and wofe indicators are directly related to the increase in twi examination of indicators shows the effect of spi on flood formation areas with less stream power are usually more prone to flooding mojaddadi et al 2017 due to the trend of bel and wofe indices increasing spi reduces the probability of flooding most areas with higher spi values are located in mountains and steep areas where floods will not occur distance from the river is one of the most important factors in fhsm the river surface rises due to heavy rainfall during floods and causes water to flood in areas near the river bank distance up to 218 m from the river had the greatest impact on the flood bel 0 8 wofe 5 83 the reverse trend of the indices with the distance from the river factor is quite evident in the results drainage density is a parameter determined based on the characteristics of the catchment and it is directly related to flood formation according to the results class 2 87 5 42 was most likely to flood due to the special characteristics of the catchment such as the shape of the catchment and the geography of the drainage catchment the probability of flood formation for the four classes is almost equal bel and wofe indices confirm the same effect on flood occurrence for example the bel index in four classes is 0 19 0 27 0 25 and 0 3 respectively whose approximate equality represents the equal share of the drainage density factor in the potential for flooding ndvi an index that illustrates the vegetation density in the study area was used in this research vegetation can decrease the speed of the runoff on the ground lei et al 2014 class 0 23 bel 0 57 wofe 4 18 is the most likely option for flood formation because the amount of vegetation to reduce floods is minimal a geology map was used in the research as this factor significantly influences on the flood formation on the ground tehrany and kumar 2018 in the study area of the ten lithology types the ratio was highest for the f class bel 0 39 wofe 1 89 this class contains dark grey shale and sandstone soil type directly impacts on water storage permeability and drainage mojaddadi et al 2017 according to soil science reports 90 percent of the study area is covered by silty clay loam clay loam which is naturally more likely to occur in this area in the bel index the silty clay loam clay loam class coefficient is twice that of other classes indicating the high potential of areas with such soil but the wofe index does not show the soil type factor well lu lc is a very important factor in identifying flood sensitive areas vegetated areas provide protection mechanisms that make the land less prone to flooding therefore there is a negative relationship between flood occurrence and vegetation density conversely urban areas increase the stormwater runoff due to large impermeable surfaces shafapour tehrany et al 2017 agricultural lands are known as flood prone areas considering urban areas as the most vulnerable areas to floods urban areas with bel 0 64 and wofe 5 04 show the highest probability of flooding after the urban area agricultural lands with bel 0 17 and wofe 2 46 have more potential for flooding one of the reasons for the high levels of these values is the double period cultivation in the region because during the growing season and depending on the type of crop due to possibility of irrigation and soil saturation the risk of flooding increases according to the general study of the factors leading to floods some factors such as elevation slope and lu lc are sensitive to class changes the number and percentage of flood points change drastically by changing the class range in contrast factors such as geology and soil type have a uniform distribution and have an insignificant effect on the percentage some factors such as slope elevation and spi constantly change with the flood for instance with decreasing elevation the probability of flood also decreases in contrast a factor such as an aspect changes non uniformly therefore the performance and behavior of the factors leading to fhsm are different the values obtained from the four functions of the ebf method are shown in fig 6 a the bel index values ranged from 1 43 to 6 06 and the dis index values ranged from 1 64 to 3 25 fig 6b in this study the bel function was used for fhsm and values of bel were divided into five classes based on the natural break method fig 7 1 43 1 95 very low 1 95 2 45 low 2 45 3 42 moderate 3 42 4 48 high and 4 48 6 06 very high the wofe values ranged from 2 56 to 45 72 these values were divided into five classes using the natural break method fig 8 21 98 to 9 75 very low 9 75 to 1 74 low 1 74 to 5 08 moderate 5 08 14 03 high and 14 03 34 71 very high table 9 according to the ebf method most of the studied catchment is moderate in flood probability 50 60 according to this index other classes very high high low and very low are 1 87 24 98 22 48 and 0 07 respectively similar to the ebf method the result of wofe method are as follows very high 8 76 high 20 92 moderate 24 68 low 26 11 and very low 19 53 table 9 3 2 applying the topsis mcdm method by examining the results of the questionnaires answered by flood experts the weight of each factor based on the ahp method is presented according to fig 9 lyu et al 2020 questionnaires were distributed among 20 geologists hydrologists and water experts who have the required knowledge about golestan basin to score each factor for topsis method these questionnaires were compared in pairs and a score between 0 and 9 was obtained finally by the ahp method each numerical factor was assigned between 0 and 1 slope distance from river and geological factors with weights of 0 25 0 16 and 0 11 respectively have the most role in flood formation the aspect factor with a weight of 0 02 has the least effect in flood formation as mentioned in the methodology section 200 random points are selected to apply the topsis method table 8 shows the calculations of topsis coefficients with a few examples of random points after determining the weight of parameters and creating fhsm indicators such as the ebf and wofe methods they were categorized from very low to very high in 5 classes according to the results of the topsis method the low class with 28 87 and the high class with 11 62 cover the maximum and minimum area respectively table 9 fig 10 shows fhsm based on the topsis method 3 3 validation of models the fhsm map is derived from the ebf wofe and topsis methods and shows different efficiency validity validation should be done to determine which model is more reliable based on the analysis the topsis method has an accuracy of 92 83 also wofe and ebf methods have 88 57 and 83 01 accuracy respectively fig 11 auc analysis shows that the accuracy of the topsis method with the prediction rate method is equal to 84 23 which is higher than wofe method 76 26 and ebf method 62 51 fig 12 the fr and scai indices in table 9 also confirm that the topsis model is accurate by examining the fhsm maps the accuracy of the topsis method in the northern regions especially at the basin outlet is closer to reality due to its compliance with the historical flood records registered in government organizations such as the ministry of energy a significant point in the error related to statistical models is the lack of flood spots in the mentioned areas which has reduced the accuracy in explaining this discussion we can refer to the lack of reference in government documents to record flood runoff at a distance from the river which overshadows the validity and accuracy of the model at a distance from the river 4 discussion natural hazards can vary depending on their severity and magnitude on the other hand this type of event causes a lot of financial and human losses therefore predicting this occurrence with the exiting tools seems necessary because it is very effective in policy making and decision making before during and after the occurrence tsakiris 2007 flood hazard susceptibility mapping fhsm is a basic and simple method used by governments for flood control policy cao et al 2016 the result of fhsm is the identification of flood prone areas based on factors affecting floods dahri abida 2017 identifying and classifying flood prone areas can significantly reduce casualties and losses yariyan et al 2020a b geographic information systems gis and remote sensing techniques rs have significantly contributed to the study of multidimensional events such as floods this has been made possible by extracting of frcfs such as slope drainage density etc for flood analysis tang et al 2018 in this study two statistical methods and the mcdm method gis and rs were used to determine fhsm in northern iran ebf and wofe methods have been used in the statistical method to create fhsm due to their high efficiency in natural hazard studies so 12 factors affecting flood generation and 56 flood points were used although ebf and wofe methods have complex computational processes they have many advantages including combining different source reliability and relative flexibility for accepting uncertainty arabameri et al 2017 li wang 2019 tehrany et al 2014 one of the disadvantages of this model is the lack of proper response to zero occurrences in a class the second method uses the topsis method to determine the fhsm which is not very common in flood mapping one of the most important advantages of this method is the lack of need for recent flood information for this reason in areas where flood information is not recorded this method can be used to determine the fhsm the most prominent features of this model are the conversion of quantitative and qualitative criteria to each other quantitative weighting compatibility of factors its flexibility against different inputs and analysis of responses and ease of implementation lai et al 1994 ahp is a method of weighting mcdm models that can determine the weight of each factor the ahp method hierarchically allows the collection of ideas according to the results of the ahp method slope distance from river and geology factors have the highest weight in causing floods which is consistent with the studies arabameri et al 2017 kalantari et al 2014 ahmadisharaf et al 2016 tehrany kumar 2018 the degree of slope has a great effect on the flood flow because it regulates the infiltration rate of the runoff and its volume and speed riggs 1976 distance from the river affects the spread and magnitude of the flood and causes inundation tehrany et al 2014 different geological structures also directly or indirectly affect flood formation magilligan 1992 although the nature of mcdm models is completely different from statistical logistic regression the comparison of apples with apples is not very common still according to the validation methods the mcdm model has higher accuracy than statistical models in creating fhsm in statistical methods ebf and wofe have almost the same accuracy this is similar to the efficiency of the ebf and wofe methods in evaluating landslide susceptibility mapping for the muchuan county in china from which ebf method auc 79 1 had higher prediction accuracy than the wofe method auc 75 3 li wang 2019 yariyan et al 2020 examined ebf fr and ordered weight average owa in flood susceptibility mapping for saqqez in iran using nine flood conditioning factors slope rainfall slope length topographic wetness index slope aspect altitude curvature distance from river geology and land use land cover and concluded that the ebf method auc 0 951 had higher accuracy than the other two models fr is not widely used to validate fhsm results therefore the findings of this study are correlated with previous studies arabameri et al 2019 cao et al 2016 costache et al 2020 rahmati et al 2016a b sahana patel 2019 samanta et al 2018 shafapour tehrany et al 2017 siahkamari et al 2018 however the evaluation of the findings in this study indicated that the fr also exhibited high accuracy because the extent of areas with high to very high floods was more consistent with ground data creating forecast maps for high potential flood areas interpreted in this study will greatly assist water policymakers in making decisions to reduce flood damage in 2018 tehrany and kumar assessed and prepared a possible flood map in brisbane australia in this study the three methods of ebf fr and logistic regression lr were compared leading to the ebf method s superiority another study conducted by hong in 2018 in a region of china compared wofe and support vector methods for evaluating and generating flood maps the combination of the fuzzy model and wofe has been evaluated to increase accuracy and usability similar to the two studies this current study s findings also show that slope is the vital frcf in flood generation in 2018 yang et al used the topsis method and compared it with a statistical method shannon entropy in the hainan region of china in this study the accuracy of the topsis method was higher than the statistical method which confirms the results of this study however this study presents its new application by considering the maximum frcfs with one mcdm and two statistical models using three validation methods auroc curve seed cell area index and frequency ratio methods 5 conclusions in flood hazard susceptibility mapping the purpose of statistical and mcdm models is to discover the most appropriate model to describe the correlation between the presence or absence of flood dependent factor and a set of conditional factors independent variables today with water prevention policies tools such as flood risk mapping have been widely developed to assist management and strategy in infrastructure decisions in the present study three methods of ebf and wofe statistical models and topsis mcdm model methods are compared statistical approaches use inventory data sample based on the relationship between dependent variables which include the presence or absence of floods and independent or conditional variables based on those correlations few predictions are made for areas that are currently flood free but with similar conditions ebf and wofe have an additional advantage that can evaluate the correlation between conditional factors using mathematic rules to achieve this goal in this study the fhsm results of the ma catchment obtained using the topsis ebf and wofe were evaluated using three statistical validation methods with 56 ground point data in addition 12 frcfs were considered for the three fhsm modelling methods applied in this study the results showed that the topsis is superior to the ebf and wofe methods using the ahp method on 12 factors affecting flood formation the role of the slope distance from the river and geology of the region have been determined as related this study suggests that gis and rs techniques and their combination with statistical methods and mcdm can provide results with appropriate accuracy from the authors point of view some of the advantages of the statistical method can be highlighted including the fact that patterns and correlations are clear and visible taken from large samples so high generalizability can be used and re used to check different variables can be imitated to check changes which increase reliability and representativeness on the other hand the obvious limitations include the inability to check validity not to find a mechanism for causality theory but only to draw patterns and correlations from data statistical data are often secondary data meaning that they can easily be misinterpreted statistical data can be misused it can be manipulated and phrased to indicate what the researcher wants to show affects objectivity the mcdm method especially topsis has advantages such as the ability to apply discrete alternative challenges are the most important approaches to solving real world problems and can immediately identify suitable alternatives in addition the paired comparison reduces the requirements and the capacity constraint may not significantly control the process the mcdm has two important limitations first the lack of prediction for weight extraction and the examination of the consistency of judgments second mcdm does not consider the relative importance of distances although the approaches done in a sub basin of gorganroud the results obtained in this paper can be used as a guide for the implementation of statistical methods and multi criteria decision in other sub basins of this gorganroud basin which has a temperate climate and statistics data are enough in this study two general statistical approaches and multi criteria decision making have been evaluated in preparing fhsm however it is suggested that conceptual models be compared with the models adopted for future research in addition other contributing factors e g antecedent soil moisture condition climatic factors may also be considered as input data layers declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
3204,the hydraulic characteristics of rock masses usually show strong anisotropy due to the existence of oriented structure planes a new semi analytical method is proposed for estimation of the anisotropic hydraulic conductivity of fractured rock masses based on the discrete fracture network dfn description and the snow s model snow 1969 in this method the number of intersections on a fracture is a key parameter to construct correction coefficient which are used to adjust the contribution of each individual fracture to the macro hydraulic conductivity tensor in this way the initial snow s model is extended from infinite connectivity conditions to finite connectivity conditions the correction coefficient is determined by using a mathematical optimization method in the condition of networks following isotropic orientation distribution and polydisperse size distribution then the new method is applied to estimate the directional hydraulic conductivity of engineering rock masses with complex anisotropic oriented fracture networks the results show that the directional hydraulic conductivities predicted by the proposed semi analytical method are in good agreement with the referential numerical results the proposed semi analytical model can be used to predict the anisotropic hydraulic conductivity of complex fractured rock masses with less processing time and lower memory requirements than numerical models keywords directional hydraulic conductivity discrete fracture network snow s model equivalent continuum model 1 introduction understanding hydraulic properties of fractured rocks is of great significance in many rock engineering problems such as natural gas and oil recovery carbon dioxide sequestration and site selection for radioactive waste repositories and dam foundations zhou et al 2008 zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 the existence of fractures usually results in strong anisotropy of rock mass conductivity the determination of anisotropic hydraulic characteristics of fractured rocks and establishment of the equivalent continuum models can help implement large scale continuum analysis in more efficient ways baghbanan and jing 2007 zheng et al 2020 two crucial factors should be specified when employing equivalent continuum models the size of representative elementary volume rev and the equivalent hydraulic conductivity tensor studies on the existence and size of rev has been widely studied by previous works azizmohammadi and matthäi 2017 azizmohammadi and sedaghat 2020 baghbanan and jing 2007 min et al 2004 rong et al 2013 zhou et al 2008 in this paper we focus on the determination of the hydraulic conductivity tensor the hydraulic conductivity tensor of rock mass may be assessed using empirical analytical and numerical approaches shahbazi et al 2020 in situ tests hsieh et al 1985 are often time consuming and expensive due to the high requirements on experimental conditions numerical approaches bogdanov et al 2003 chen et al 2018 wang et al 2002 yao et al 2019 and analytical or semi analytical approaches chen et al 1999 ebigbo et al 2016 hestir and long 1990 lang et al 2014 lee et al 1995 mourzenko et al 2011 2011 oda 1985 rong et al 2013 saevik et al 2014 snow 1969 vu et al 2018 zhou et al 2008 zoorabadi et al 2021 2012 are relatively cheaper and faster with the development of computer technology stochastic simulation techniques under the frame of discrete fracture network dfn advance the analytical and numerical studies baghbanan and jing 2007 guo et al 2018 long 1983 min et al 2004 due to difficult to obtain complete geometric parameters of fracture network the monte carlo method improves the reliability of dfn based studies in which networks are regenerated by statistical data min et al 2004 based on the dfn description snow 1969 obtains the expression for the individual contribution of a single fracture with arbitrary orientation and aperture for the macroscopic hydraulic conductivity tensor this model based on the assumption that the fractures are infinity plane channels however fractures in rocks do not extend infinitely in most cases and not all fractures contribute to the hydraulic conductivity of research domain berkowitz 2002 for example isolated fracture can only exchange water with the surrounding matrix yao et al 2019 fractures poorly connect with the main seepage channels also have very limited contribution to the hydraulic conductivity saevik et al 2014 therefore snow s model usually be viewed as an upper bond for the analytical models ebigbo et al 2016 and need modifications to accommodate naturally fractured rock masses to take account in the geometry characteristics and connectivity of the finite sized fractures oda 1985 introduced an analytical model based on the concept of fracture tensor and then added global correction coefficient to consider the effects of connectivity and roughness of fractures on the hydraulic conductivity tensor on the other hand zhou et al 2008 derived an analytical model for determining the hydraulic conductivity tensor of fractured rock masses using the superposition concept of liquid dissipation energy in this model fractures are classified into several clusters in advance and then the contribution of each fracture to the hydraulic conductivity tensor is determined according to the geometry and intersection number of each individual fracture the above two models and snow s model are equivalent under certain conditions although they have different assumptions and different function forms zhou et al 2008 the main difference among them lies in the ways to penalize the fracture contributions on the hydraulic conductivity due to the insufficient connectivity connectivity measures based on fracture network geometry and topology is an important tool for analytical estimations of effective hydraulic conductivity of fractured rocks rouleau and gale 1985 introduced an empirical inter connectivity index considering the mean trace length and average angle between fractures which is then adopted in the analytical models by zoorabadi et al 2012 xu et al 2007 defined the connectivity index ci for representing the anisotropy of the hydraulic conductivity of fracture network zhou et al 2008 and rong et al 2013 use the ratio of the number of intersections on a fracture and the average intersection number of fractures in the fracture cluster to which it belongs to measure the connectivity saevik et al 2014 classified intersection nodes between fracture segments in two dimensional situation and then proposed a modification procedure for the estimation of effective hydraulic conductivity the dimensionless density of fracture network which will be introduced in section 2 is also a utility measure of connectivity adler et al 2012 adler and thovert 1999 koudina et al 1998 bogdanov et al 2003 and mourzenko et al 2011 proposed analytical expressions of effective hydraulic conductivity based on the dimensionless fracture density for isotropic oriented and uniformly distributed fracture networks khamforoush et al 2008 expended the results to networks that follow anisotropic fisher distribution characterized by a single direction in this paper a new semi analytical method under the dfn description is proposed for estimating hydraulic conductivity tensor of fractured rock with anisotropic oriented fracture network the equation is based on snow s model snow 1969 with penalization on the contribution of each fracture the form of correction coefficient is inspired by the semi analytical models of hestir 1990 and mourzenko 2011 in dealing with isotropic oriented fracture networks in the following we will firstly introduce the basic theories and equations of the new method then the parameters of the method are determined by the monte carlo strategy and least square method finally the new method is validated through comparing with numerical results of typical engineering examples 2 equations real rock fractures typically include rough walls varying apertures and asperity surface where the two opposite side of fracture walls contact with each other in practice assuming that the fluid flow within rock joints is laminar a single equivalent value is commonly used to describe the hydraulic aperture of an individual fracture barton et al 1985 patir and cheng 1978 the cubic law zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 is used to relate the fracture aperture to the fracture permeability k f l2 1 k f b 2 12 in which b is the equivalent hydraulic aperture of the fracture the fracture transmissivity σ l2t 1 is defined as 2 σ k f ρ g b μ ρ g b 3 12 μ for a network with planner fracture shape and infinite fracture size snow et al 1969 proposed a widely used hydraulic conductivity tensor model assuming that an individual fracture with its particular orientation is a discrete event the equation can be written in the direct summation form 3 k ij snow 1 v k 1 n σ k s k δ ij n il n jl where ksnow ij lt 1 is the fracture network permeability tensor ρ ml 3 is the density of fluid g lt 2 is the acceleration due to gravity μ ml 1t 1 is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid v l3 is the volume of the research domain n is the total number of fractures σ k l3 and s k l2 are the transmissivity and area of fracture k respectively δij is the kronecker delta n is the unit directional vector normal to the fracture surface because all fractures extend infinitely the hydraulic gradient in the research domain is constant and all fracture contributes to the snow s model as mentioned in the introduction how to penalize the contribution of fractures to hydraulic conductivity when connectivity is low is the key to reduce the difference between the true value and the estimation the idea in this work was inspired by the treatment on isotropic fracture networks by hestir and long 1990 and mourzenko et al 2011 the isotropic means the orientation shape and size of fractures have the same statistical characteristics in all directions on the opposite if the fracture orientation shape or size are not statistically identical in different direction the network is said to be anisotropic for isotropic fracture networks if all fractures have the same hydraulic aperture the ksnow ij in eq 3 is a spherical tensor and can be reduced to scalar koudina et al 1998 4 k snow 2 3 σ s f where s f is the total fracture areas in unit volume when adopting the global penalize strategy a correction coefficient λ can be introduced in as eq 5 5 k λ k snow λ 2 3 σ s f the value of λ is related to the connectivity of fracture network between 0 and 1 for large fracture densities numerical fits can be used to suggest an approximate expression for λ hestir and long 1990 and mourzenko et al 2011 gave different forms of λ which are called the λ hestir and the λ mourzenko in the following respectively 6 λ hestir 1 1 c 1 ρ c 2 7 λ mourzenko γ ρ ρ c 2 ρ 1 γ ρ ρ c in which c 1 c 2 and γ are empirical parameters for eq 6 c 1 0 10 c 2 6 6 and for eq 7 γ 0 18 for the regular hexagonal fracture ρ is a connectivity measurement called the dimensionless fracture density bogdanov et al 2003 8 ρ 1 2 ρ f k 1 n 1 n a k p k where ρ f is the number of fractures per unit volume a k l2 and p k l are the area and perimeter of fracture k respectively ρ has been widely used in the studies of fracture network hydraulic conductivity and topology for more details can refer to adler and thovert 1999 and adler et al 2012 ρ c is the percolation threshold of the isotropic fracture network thovert et al 2017 representing the critical ρ that fracture channels can run through an infinite research domain as shown in fig 1 eqs 6 and 7 are monotonically increasing functions and λ gradually approaches 1 as ρ increases which coincides to the rational scope of the penalizing parameter proposed by oda 1985 this kind of penalizations recognize two understandings 1 the hydraulic conductivity of fracture networks increases as the increment of network connectivity but 2 would not exceed the solution by snow s model eq 4 although ρ cannot be directly applied to anisotropic networks adler et al 2012 such models gave us the inspiration one could replace the ρ with another connectivity measure under the form like eqs 6 and 7 fortunately huseby et al 1997 reported that the dimensionless fracture density ρ is precisely equal to the mean number of intersections per fracture in isotropic networks write as 9 ρ 1 n f k 1 n f n i k where the n f is the number of fractures and the n i k is the number of intersections on fracture k this proves that ρ is directly related to n i in isotropic networks in fact there are many other models that use connectivity measures based on the number of fracture intersections e g khamforoush et al 2008 rong et al 2013 saevik and nixon 2017 zhou et al 2008 zoorabadi et al 2021 therefore a new connectivity penalization expression λnew

paper as reported by thovert et al 2017 different from eq 6 and 7 eq 10 acts on each fracture to modify their contribution to the hydraulic conductivity tensor in addition it is not hard to imagine that larger fractures will often intersect with more fractures than smaller ones thus the proposed model emphasizes the contribution from large fractures while the important role of well connected

interfaces between tetrahedrons as shown in fig 2 fractures are represented as the green triangular element network and the matrix is equivalently represented by the blue triangular element network by properly setting the transmissivity of the two types of elements the three dimensional seepage problem becomes a two dimensional problem details about matrix equivalent method was introduced by yao et al 2019 the model takes water head at each node as the unknown quantity and the continuity equation is satisfied inside each triangular element 12 v 0 in which v is the local velocity vector in the triangular element the flow exchange between the elements is assumed to be completed on the common edge then yield the conservation equation 13 i 1 m q i 0 where m is the number of elements connects with the common edge qi denotes the flow rate from element i to the common edge the validation of the model under simple fracture conditions can be found in yao et al 2019 to validate the correctness of the model under the condition of complex fracture network we simulate a classical example introduced by bogdanov et al 2003 it is assumed that l is the side length of the cube study domain and the

take the circumradius of fracture r and the hydraulic conductivity of matrix k m as the basic characteristic quantities then introduce the dimensionless variables 15 σ σ r k m k k eff k m in which the k eff is the effective hydraulic conductivity of the research domain the results by bogdanov et al 2003 by vu et al 2018 and by emfn are plotted in fig 4 to consider the variability of random fracture network realizations monte carlo scheme is adopted the average value of ten random realizations is adopted for each data point by emfn four different dimensionless fracture transmissivity σ 10 102 103 and 104 are tested as shown in fig 3 the proposed numerical model agrees well with the other two solutions under the complex fracture network conditions 3 2 calibration for the correction coefficient parameters the values of α and β in eq 10 are determined using the least square scheme the numerical results by emfn model are taken as the reference solution monte carlo technique is adopted to obtain more results at each fracture density to average effects of stochastic realizations on the global results the optimization target is to minimize the sum of squares of the difference between numerical and analytical solutions for each network realization written as 16 min f α β k 1 n r k num k k ana k α β 2 where n r is the total number of realizations k num and k ana are obtained by emfn and eq 11 for realization k respectively the optimization process is carried out in python using the leastsq function in the scipy module since the new model does not require fracture grouping in advance and should be compatible with isotropic networks we take isotropic networks as a special case to calibrate the parameters the shape of research domain and boundary conditions are the same as shown in fig 3 a cube research domain is built with a side length l equal to 100 m the hydraulic conductivity of matrix km is defined as 10 10 m s and the fracture transmissivity σ is defined as 10 5 m 2 s fractures are disk shaped and are randomly and uniformly distributed in the research domain in order to take into account the variability of fracture sizes observed in nature four groups of network configurations with different fracture size distributions are generated in which the group 1 has constant fracture radio r 12 5 m in the other groups i e group 2 3 and 4 r follows power law distribution with probability density function p r as 17 p r η e η r the group 2 group 3 and group 4 are assigned η 0 14 0 28 and 0 42 respectively in addition to avoid creating fractures that are too large or too small r in these three groups is limited to a range of 3 5 m to 12 5 m each group have 8 levels of fracture density namely ρ 5 8 11 14 17 20 23 26 to reduce the variability caused by random fracture networks 10 realizations were generated for each ρ and the hydraulic conductivity in three perpendicular main directions are calculated respectively for each realization fig 5 plots the curves of calibrated λ new versus n i for the above four groups of experiments respectively it can be seen that the size distribution of fractures have negligible influence on the function λ new n i therefore we take α and β obtained after least squares optimization of all data i e group 1 2 3 and 4 as parameters of eq 10 that is 18 α 0 06657 β 1 275 fig 6 shows the comparison of the numerical solutions and the analytical solutions by eqs 11 and 18 the hydraulic conductivity of matrix km is defined as 10 10 m s and the fracture transmissivity σ is defined as 10 5 m 2 s each data point in the figure is an average of the hydraulic conductivities of the realizations of group 1 2 3 and 4 in three directions the results show that the calibrated model successfully predicted the hydraulic conductivity of fractured rock with both monodisperse and polydisperse fracture networks to examine the impact of σ on the new model fig 7 show the comparison of the numerical solutions and the analytical solutions of group 1 with km 10 10 m s and σ 10 7 m s 10 6 m s 10 5 m s and 10 4 m s respectively it can be seen that the fit eq 18 is also valid for the other values of σ however it worth noting that at the scatter with ρ 5 and σ 10 7 m2 s the analytical result is smaller than the numerical result this suggests that the new semi analytical model will underestimate the hydraulic conductivity in the conditions that the fracture density is low and the difference of permeability between fracture and matrix is low this is possibly because when the fracture density is low enough to close to the percolation threshold of fracture networks the variation of permeability coefficient will show other rules which should be described by other models bogdanov et al 2003 for the current research ρ 5 is taken as the lower limit of fracture density to ensure the accuracy of the model 4 case study in order to validate the proposed semi analytical model it is used to predict the directional hydraulic conductivity of rock masses containing complex fracture networks the results are compared with the numerical results calculated by the emfn model in the same conditions fractures in these networks are disk shaped statistically anisotropic oriented and polydisperse size distributed for the sake of generality three kinds of rock masses containing stochastically reconstructed fracture networks that follow different statistical characteristics are constructed the statistical parameters are set with reference to the field survey results of 1 jijicao gansu province china 2 nuozhadu hydropower project yunnan province china and 3 tianhuangping hydropower project zhejiang province china mei and yang 2008 wang 2010 respectively and listed in the appendix the matrix hydraulic conductivity km is assumed equal to 10 10 m s and the fracture transmissivity σ is assumed identical and equal to 10 6 m2 s the reference directional hydraulic conductivity is obtained numerically by the emfn model in the testing process a fracture field much larger than the research domain is generated the typical research domain and its boundary conditions are the same as shown in fig 3 the center of the research domain is fixed at the center of the fracture field and then the cube research domain is rotated to calculate the directional hydraulic conductivities fig 8 illustrates the shape and boundary conditions of rotational research domains the direction of hydraulic gradient coincides with the calculating direction the hydraulic conductivity is calculated in 30 degrees intervals along the horizontal and vertical directions then we can obtain 62 numerical directional hydraulic conductivities for each network realization at the same time the analytical hydraulic conductivity tensor for each research domain is calculated by eq 11 the analytical directional hydraulic conductivities are estimated by eq 19 19 k n nkn t where n is the unit vector of the calculate direction k is the hydraulic conductivity tensor obtained by eq 11 in addition it worth noting that the simulated directional hydraulic conductivities cannot be converted into the hydraulic conductivity tensor one can only to an approximate tensor according to some fitting procedure a comparison between numerical and semi analytical directional hydraulic conductivities is shown in fig 9 it can be seen that the directional hydraulic conductivity estimated by the new semi analytical model are very close to results obtained by the numerical model these case studies show that the proposed semi analytical model is valid in predicting directional hydraulic conductivity of fractured rock masses 5 conclusion and discussion a new semi analytical model is proposed for estimation of anisotropic hydraulic conductivity tensor of three dimensional complex fractured rock mass in this work based on the analytical expression of hydraulic conductivity tensor proposed by snow 1969 the new model uses the number of intersections on fractures to construct the correction coefficient and corrects the contribution of each fracture to the hydraulic conductivity tensor the new model is inspired by the works of hestir 1990 and mourzenko 2011 and overcomes the shortcoming of their models in dealing with anisotropic fracture networks adopting the number of intersections per fracture as a measurement of connectivity implies the acknowledgement that the better a fracture connects with the network the greater it contributes to the hydraulic conductivity of rock mass on the contrary relatively isolated fractures regardless of their size have limited effect on the rock hydraulic conductivity the new semi analytical model is verified by comparing the predicted directional hydraulic conductivity of fractured rock masses with the results of numerical model the proposed semi analytical model effectively avoids the complex mesh discretizing process and huge cost of solving partial differential equations in the numerical methods while enjoys similar accuracy which makes the proposed method suitable for solving large scale engineering problems with dense fractures in spite of these advantages the model currently still faces some limitations although it is a simple and practical approach to use the number of intersections as a connectivity indicator consideration of more connectivity characteristics such as angle between fractures length of intersecting lines etc may yield more accurate results furthermore the current validations are still limited to relatively simple conditions and it is difficult to say whether the proposed model is valid in other more complex situations which needs further research in addition due to the scarcity of available information on fracture geometry and connectivity building reliable discrete fracture network model is still a very difficult task credit authorship contribution statement chen he writing original draft methodology

3204,the hydraulic characteristics of rock masses usually show strong anisotropy due to the existence of oriented structure planes a new semi analytical method is proposed for estimation of the anisotropic hydraulic conductivity of fractured rock masses based on the discrete fracture network dfn description and the snow s model snow 1969 in this method the number of intersections on a fracture is a key parameter to construct correction coefficient which are used to adjust the contribution of each individual fracture to the macro hydraulic conductivity tensor in this way the initial snow s model is extended from infinite connectivity conditions to finite connectivity conditions the correction coefficient is determined by using a mathematical optimization method in the condition of networks following isotropic orientation distribution and polydisperse size distribution then the new method is applied to estimate the directional hydraulic conductivity of engineering rock masses with complex anisotropic oriented fracture networks the results show that the directional hydraulic conductivities predicted by the proposed semi analytical method are in good agreement with the referential numerical results the proposed semi analytical model can be used to predict the anisotropic hydraulic conductivity of complex fractured rock masses with less processing time and lower memory requirements than numerical models keywords directional hydraulic conductivity discrete fracture network snow s model equivalent continuum model 1 introduction understanding hydraulic properties of fractured rocks is of great significance in many rock engineering problems such as natural gas and oil recovery carbon dioxide sequestration and site selection for radioactive waste repositories and dam foundations zhou et al 2008 zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 the existence of fractures usually results in strong anisotropy of rock mass conductivity the determination of anisotropic hydraulic characteristics of fractured rocks and establishment of the equivalent continuum models can help implement large scale continuum analysis in more efficient ways baghbanan and jing 2007 zheng et al 2020 two crucial factors should be specified when employing equivalent continuum models the size of representative elementary volume rev and the equivalent hydraulic conductivity tensor studies on the existence and size of rev has been widely studied by previous works azizmohammadi and matthäi 2017 azizmohammadi and sedaghat 2020 baghbanan and jing 2007 min et al 2004 rong et al 2013 zhou et al 2008 in this paper we focus on the determination of the hydraulic conductivity tensor the hydraulic conductivity tensor of rock mass may be assessed using empirical analytical and numerical approaches shahbazi et al 2020 in situ tests hsieh et al 1985 are often time consuming and expensive due to the high requirements on experimental conditions numerical approaches bogdanov et al 2003 chen et al 2018 wang et al 2002 yao et al 2019 and analytical or semi analytical approaches chen et al 1999 ebigbo et al 2016 hestir and long 1990 lang et al 2014 lee et al 1995 mourzenko et al 2011 2011 oda 1985 rong et al 2013 saevik et al 2014 snow 1969 vu et al 2018 zhou et al 2008 zoorabadi et al 2021 2012 are relatively cheaper and faster with the development of computer technology stochastic simulation techniques under the frame of discrete fracture network dfn advance the analytical and numerical studies baghbanan and jing 2007 guo et al 2018 long 1983 min et al 2004 due to difficult to obtain complete geometric parameters of fracture network the monte carlo method improves the reliability of dfn based studies in which networks are regenerated by statistical data min et al 2004 based on the dfn description snow 1969 obtains the expression for the individual contribution of a single fracture with arbitrary orientation and aperture for the macroscopic hydraulic conductivity tensor this model based on the assumption that the fractures are infinity plane channels however fractures in rocks do not extend infinitely in most cases and not all fractures contribute to the hydraulic conductivity of research domain berkowitz 2002 for example isolated fracture can only exchange water with the surrounding matrix yao et al 2019 fractures poorly connect with the main seepage channels also have very limited contribution to the hydraulic conductivity saevik et al 2014 therefore snow s model usually be viewed as an upper bond for the analytical models ebigbo et al 2016 and need modifications to accommodate naturally fractured rock masses to take account in the geometry characteristics and connectivity of the finite sized fractures oda 1985 introduced an analytical model based on the concept of fracture tensor and then added global correction coefficient to consider the effects of connectivity and roughness of fractures on the hydraulic conductivity tensor on the other hand zhou et al 2008 derived an analytical model for determining the hydraulic conductivity tensor of fractured rock masses using the superposition concept of liquid dissipation energy in this model fractures are classified into several clusters in advance and then the contribution of each fracture to the hydraulic conductivity tensor is determined according to the geometry and intersection number of each individual fracture the above two models and snow s model are equivalent under certain conditions although they have different assumptions and different function forms zhou et al 2008 the main difference among them lies in the ways to penalize the fracture contributions on the hydraulic conductivity due to the insufficient connectivity connectivity measures based on fracture network geometry and topology is an important tool for analytical estimations of effective hydraulic conductivity of fractured rocks rouleau and gale 1985 introduced an empirical inter connectivity index considering the mean trace length and average angle between fractures which is then adopted in the analytical models by zoorabadi et al 2012 xu et al 2007 defined the connectivity index ci for representing the anisotropy of the hydraulic conductivity of fracture network zhou et al 2008 and rong et al 2013 use the ratio of the number of intersections on a fracture and the average intersection number of fractures in the fracture cluster to which it belongs to measure the connectivity saevik et al 2014 classified intersection nodes between fracture segments in two dimensional situation and then proposed a modification procedure for the estimation of effective hydraulic conductivity the dimensionless density of fracture network which will be introduced in section 2 is also a utility measure of connectivity adler et al 2012 adler and thovert 1999 koudina et al 1998 bogdanov et al 2003 and mourzenko et al 2011 proposed analytical expressions of effective hydraulic conductivity based on the dimensionless fracture density for isotropic oriented and uniformly distributed fracture networks khamforoush et al 2008 expended the results to networks that follow anisotropic fisher distribution characterized by a single direction in this paper a new semi analytical method under the dfn description is proposed for estimating hydraulic conductivity tensor of fractured rock with anisotropic oriented fracture network the equation is based on snow s model snow 1969 with penalization on the contribution of each fracture the form of correction coefficient is inspired by the semi analytical models of hestir 1990 and mourzenko 2011 in dealing with isotropic oriented fracture networks in the following we will firstly introduce the basic theories and equations of the new method then the parameters of the method are determined by the monte carlo strategy and least square method finally the new method is validated through comparing with numerical results of typical engineering examples 2 equations real rock fractures typically include rough walls varying apertures and asperity surface where the two opposite side of fracture walls contact with each other in practice assuming that the fluid flow within rock joints is laminar a single equivalent value is commonly used to describe the hydraulic aperture of an individual fracture barton et al 1985 patir and cheng 1978 the cubic law zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 is used to relate the fracture aperture to the fracture permeability k f l2 1 k f b 2 12 in which b is the equivalent hydraulic aperture of the fracture the fracture transmissivity σ l2t 1 is defined as 2 σ k f ρ g b μ ρ g b 3 12 μ for a network with planner fracture shape and infinite fracture size snow et al 1969 proposed a widely used hydraulic conductivity tensor model assuming that an individual fracture with its particular orientation is a discrete event the equation can be written in the direct summation form 3 k ij snow 1 v k 1 n σ k s k δ ij n il n jl where ksnow ij lt 1 is the fracture network permeability tensor ρ ml 3 is the density of fluid g lt 2 is the acceleration due to gravity μ ml 1t 1 is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid v l3 is the volume of the research domain n is the total number of fractures σ k l3 and s k l2 are the transmissivity and area of fracture k respectively δij is the kronecker delta n is the unit directional vector normal to the fracture surface because all fractures extend infinitely the hydraulic gradient in the research domain is constant and all fracture contributes to the snow s model as mentioned in the introduction how to penalize the contribution of fractures to hydraulic conductivity when connectivity is low is the key to reduce the difference between the true value and the estimation the idea in this work was inspired by the treatment on isotropic fracture networks by hestir and long 1990 and mourzenko et al 2011 the isotropic means the orientation shape and size of fractures have the same statistical characteristics in all directions on the opposite if the fracture orientation shape or size are not statistically identical in different direction the network is said to be anisotropic for isotropic fracture networks if all fractures have the same hydraulic aperture the ksnow ij in eq 3 is a spherical tensor and can be reduced to scalar koudina et al 1998 4 k snow 2 3 σ s f where s f is the total fracture areas in unit volume when adopting the global penalize strategy a correction coefficient λ can be introduced in as eq 5 5 k λ k snow λ 2 3 σ s f the value of λ is related to the connectivity of fracture network between 0 and 1 for large fracture densities numerical fits can be used to suggest an approximate expression for λ hestir and long 1990 and mourzenko et al 2011 gave different forms of λ which are called the λ hestir and the λ mourzenko in the following respectively 6 λ hestir 1 1 c 1 ρ c 2 7 λ mourzenko γ ρ ρ c 2 ρ 1 γ ρ ρ c in which c 1 c 2 and γ are empirical parameters for eq 6 c 1 0 10 c 2 6 6 and for eq 7 γ 0 18 for the regular hexagonal fracture ρ is a connectivity measurement called the dimensionless fracture density bogdanov et al 2003 8 ρ 1 2 ρ f k 1 n 1 n a k p k where ρ f is the number of fractures per unit volume a k l2 and p k l are the area and perimeter of fracture k respectively ρ has been widely used in the studies of fracture network hydraulic conductivity and topology for more details can refer to adler and thovert 1999 and adler et al 2012 ρ c is the percolation threshold of the isotropic fracture network thovert et al 2017 representing the critical ρ that fracture channels can run through an infinite research domain as shown in fig 1 eqs 6 and 7 are monotonically increasing functions and λ gradually approaches 1 as ρ increases which coincides to the rational scope of the penalizing parameter proposed by oda 1985 this kind of penalizations recognize two understandings 1 the hydraulic conductivity of fracture networks increases as the increment of network connectivity but 2 would not exceed the solution by snow s model eq 4 although ρ cannot be directly applied to anisotropic networks adler et al 2012 such models gave us the inspiration one could replace the ρ with another connectivity measure under the form like eqs 6 and 7 fortunately huseby et al 1997 reported that the dimensionless fracture density ρ is precisely equal to the mean number of intersections per fracture in isotropic networks write as 9 ρ 1 n f k 1 n f n i k where the n f is the number of fractures and the n i k is the number of intersections on fracture k this proves that ρ is directly related to n i in isotropic networks in fact there are many other models that use connectivity measures based on the number of fracture intersections e g khamforoush et al 2008 rong et al 2013 saevik and nixon 2017 zhou et al 2008 zoorabadi et al 2021 therefore a new connectivity penalization expression λnew based on the intersection number per fracture is written in the following 10 λ new k α n i k n i c β 1 α n i k n i c β n i k n i c 0 n i k n i c where k is the fracture number α and β are empirical parameters which can be easily obtained by calibration from simple cases as in the section 3 eq 18 n i c plays the same role as ρ c in eq 8 with the value 2 3 for disk shaped fractures used in this paper as reported by thovert et al 2017 different from eq 6 and 7 eq 10 acts on each fracture to modify their contribution to the hydraulic conductivity tensor in addition it is not hard to imagine that larger fractures will often intersect with more fractures than smaller ones thus the proposed model emphasizes the contribution from large fractures while the important role of well connected

to close to the percolation threshold of fracture networks the variation of permeability coefficient will show other rules which should be described by other models bogdanov et al 2003 for the current research ρ 5 is taken as the lower limit of fracture density to ensure the accuracy of the model 4 case study in order to validate the proposed semi analytical model it is used to predict the directional hydraulic conductivity of rock masses containing complex fracture networks the results are compared with the numerical results calculated by the emfn model in the same conditions fractures in these networks are disk shaped statistically anisotropic oriented and polydisperse size distributed for the sake of generality three kinds of rock masses containing stochastically reconstructed fracture networks that follow different statistical characteristics are constructed the statistical parameters are set with reference to the field survey results of 1 jijicao gansu province china 2 nuozhadu hydropower project yunnan province china and 3 tianhuangping hydropower project zhejiang province china mei and yang 2008 wang 2010 respectively and listed in the appendix the matrix hydraulic conductivity km is assumed equal to 10 10 m s and the fracture transmissivity σ is assumed identical and equal to 10 6 m2 s the reference directional hydraulic conductivity is obtained numerically by the emfn model in the testing process a fracture field much larger than the research domain is generated the typical research domain and its boundary conditions are the same as shown in fig 3 the center of the research domain is fixed at the center of the fracture field and then the cube research domain is rotated to calculate the directional hydraulic conductivities fig 8 illustrates the shape and boundary conditions of rotational research domains the direction of hydraulic gradient coincides with the calculating direction the hydraulic conductivity is calculated in 30 degrees intervals along the horizontal and vertical directions then we can obtain 62 numerical directional hydraulic conductivities for each network realization at the same time the analytical hydraulic conductivity tensor for each research domain is calculated by eq 11 the analytical directional hydraulic conductivities are estimated by eq 19 19 k n nkn t where n is the unit vector of the calculate direction k is the hydraulic conductivity tensor obtained by eq 11 in addition it worth noting that the simulated directional hydraulic conductivities cannot be converted into the hydraulic conductivity tensor one can only to an approximate tensor according to some fitting procedure a comparison between numerical and semi analytical directional hydraulic conductivities is shown in fig 9 it can be seen that the directional hydraulic conductivity estimated by the new semi analytical model are very close to results obtained by the numerical model these case studies show that the proposed semi analytical model is valid in predicting directional hydraulic conductivity of fractured rock masses 5 conclusion and discussion a new semi analytical model is proposed for estimation of anisotropic hydraulic conductivity tensor of three dimensional complex fractured rock mass in this work based on the analytical expression of hydraulic conductivity tensor proposed by snow 1969 the new model uses the number of intersections on fractures to construct the correction coefficient and corrects the contribution of each fracture to the hydraulic conductivity tensor the new model is inspired by the works of hestir 1990 and mourzenko 2011 and overcomes the shortcoming of their models in dealing with anisotropic fracture networks adopting the number of intersections per fracture as a measurement of connectivity implies the acknowledgement that the better a fracture connects with the network the greater it contributes to the hydraulic conductivity of rock mass on the contrary relatively isolated fractures regardless of their size have limited effect on the rock hydraulic conductivity the new semi analytical model is verified by comparing the predicted directional hydraulic conductivity of fractured rock masses with the results of numerical model the proposed semi analytical model effectively avoids the complex mesh discretizing process and huge cost of solving partial differential equations in the numerical methods while enjoys similar accuracy which makes the proposed method suitable for solving large scale engineering problems with dense fractures in spite of these advantages the model currently still faces some limitations although it is a simple and practical approach to use the number of intersections as a connectivity indicator consideration of more connectivity characteristics such as angle between fractures length of intersecting lines etc may yield more accurate results furthermore the current validations are still limited to relatively simple conditions and it is difficult to say whether the proposed model is valid in other more complex situations which needs further research in addition due to the scarcity of available information on fracture geometry and connectivity building reliable discrete fracture network model is still a very difficult task credit authorship contribution statement chen he writing original draft methodology
